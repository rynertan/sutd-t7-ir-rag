## Description
MAN SYSTEM Many different fluid power manifold systems have been available for many years. Most of these systems are designed to accommodate both the parallel connection of a plurality of individual valve means to a common source of pressure and tank and also to form more complex inter connecting circuitry between the valve means to accomplish various fluid power control functions. For a variety of reasons, these prior manifold systems have not met with widespread industry acceptance and conventional piping still represents the major vehicle for interconnecting fluid power elements in a control circuit. One of the most basic forms of a fluid power manifold is referred to as a drilled block. This is merely a rectangular solid block which is provided with aseries of drilled passages to accommodate either a supply heater or bus function and or to interconnect valve means. As the circuit connection between different valves becomes even routinely complex, the drilled block manifold requires relatively tortious cross drilling techniques and quickly becomes expensive and generally unsatisfactory for widespread industry acceptance. However, as a relatively simple supply header for mounting a plurality of individual valve means for parallel or series communication to a common pressure supply and tank, it has satisfactory utility and is moderately acceptable to the industry in those applications. The primary disadvantage of the conventional drilled rectangular block is the very significant cost factor of the material required to accommodate even the minimum spacial requirements of the internal passages necessary to accommodate a simple supply header system having no complex control functions interconnecting the valves mounted thereon. It is believed that this cost factor is one of the major reasons thwarting truly widespread industry acceptance and use of such a concept. The minimum spacial requirements of such a supply header manifold are dictated by a plurality of factors generally accepted in the industry and by the functional requirements of the system. First, the flow capacity of the header or bus system dictates the size of the main pressure supply and return ducts. The various size of the valve means to be mounted on the manifold and the porting arrangement for such standard valves dictate the required size of the internal passages communicating with the valve means. As a practical manner, a four way valve function must be accommodated. Industry practices for satisfactory acceptance require that all major ports enter or exit at a ninety degree angle on the surface of the manifold. These factors dictate the size of the block and therefore the amount of metal required to accommodate the minimum necessary flow paths and any other desirable qualities, such as pilot valve passages,in a reasonably practical and economical manner. The present invention relates generally to fluid power manifold systems and particularly to a novel and improved construction of a fluid pressure supply manifold or bus system specifically applicable for mounting a plurality of individual valve means in parallel or series communication with a common pressure duct and tank return duct and to external control or actuating functions. The manifold system in accordance with the present invention provides a feeder supply header or bus constructed to accommodate the required bus flow capacity while minimizing the amount of material necessary to accommodate all necessary spacial requirements for the valve means mounted thereon.Comparable prior art rectangular block manifolds having equivalent flow paths and supply duct flow capacity requires at least thirty three percent more material than the present invention in its preferred embodiment. The dramatic reduction of material is accomplished by providing a block having essentially a triangular cross sectional configuration wherein the individual valve means are mounted on the face of the manifold, in its preferred form, which defines the hypotenuse of the triangle formed between the valve mounting face and the two opposing sides defining the major angle of the triangle. The supply pressure and tank ducts extend through the manifold perpendicularly to the plane of the substantially triangular cross section.The various internal passages required to communicate each valve means to the pressure and tank duct and to the valve access and outlet ports are provided using standard and economical manufacturing techniques. Industry standard porting and mounting requirements, and the accepted practice of providing major ports which exit at right angles to the face of the manifold, can be easily accomplished with a beneficial reduction of labour cost. Further, in a preferred embodiment, a simple mounting bracket is supplied which orients the valves at two ninety degree opposite positions to more easily accommodate spacial positioning in the field. In one of these positions, a single standard forty five degree fitting may be employed to provide the desired ninety degree exit angle in either a horizontal or vertical direction. The supply manifold design may easily accommodate various modular forms to add flexibility of application and permit standardized manufacturing of module units for convenient and economical marketing requirements. An example of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a perspective view of a plurality of manifold module units shown in preassembled relationship and constructed in accordance with the present invention Figure 2 is a perspective view of a manifold comprising a plurality of module units such as shown in Figure 1 shown in assembled relationship with a plurality of valve means mounted thereon Figure 3 is an end elevational view of a typical manifold module unit constructed in accordance with the present invention for accommodating a conventional four way valve Figure 4 is a top plan view of the module unit shown in Figure 3 Figure 5 is an end elevational sectional view of the module unit shown in Figure 3, the section being taken along line 5 5 in Figure 4 Figure 6 is an end elevational sectional view of the module unit shown in Figure 3, the section being taken along line 6 6 in Figure 4 and Figure 7 is an end elevational view of the module unit shown in Figure 3, the section being taken along line 7 7 in Figure 4. A fluid power supply manifold system constructed in accordance with the present invention is illustrated in Figures 1, 2 and 3. The preferred embodiment shown by way of example, is a modular or building block arrangement wherein each module unit is designed to accommodate a single valve function and its body. However, it should be understood that other modular arrangements designed to accommodate two or more valve means thereon or a single manifold section to accommodate any number of valve means may be used incorporating the concept and principles of the present invention. The supply manifold system shown in Figure 1 includes a plurality of individual module units, indicated generally at 20, shown in exploded relationship for purposes of description. Each of the modules 20 are basically of identical construction with respect to the concept of the present invention. In the modular embodiment shown, the modules 20 are assembled in force transmitting and sealed relationship by means of three tie rods 22 extending through all the modules 20 and fixed conventionally by nuts 24. A functionally equivalent construction would consist of a single manifold base block which would render the tie rods unnecessary but lack a certain degree of flexibility to meet given field applications while standardizing manufacturing processes. A main pressure supply duct 26 and tank return duct 28 are extended through each module and aligned with one another to communicate each module to a common supply source of fluid pressure, not shown. For simplicity of manufacturing, the last module of any given modular set has a conventional threaded plug in the threaded bore of ducts 26 and 28.Alternatively, a sealed end module unit having a blind hole could be used if desired. Parallel to the main ducts 26 and 28, a pair of pilot pressure and tank return ducts 30 and 32 are optionally provided to permit pilot signals to be accommodated and associated with a corresponding primary valve means mounted on each module. An O ring seal is mounted in surrounding relationship to each opening of the ducts 26, 28, 30 and 32 to provide a sealed relationship when the modules are assembled as a unit upon tightening the nuts 24 on the tie rods 22. Each module 20 possesses the same crosssectional dimensions along a plane perpendicular to the axis of the ducts 26 and 28 and presents an essentially triangular configuration formed between the three major planar surfaces 32, 34 and 36. The preferred embodiment utilize an angular orientation of surface 34 relative to surfaces 32 and 36 of forty five degrees which provides a symmetrical arrangement and represents the minimum amount of material required to provide sufficient space for all necessary flow paths for a given valve arrangement and header supply capacity. As an example of a typical system, the valve mounting face 34 of the first module 20 is angularly disposed relative to faces 32 and 36 as previously described and is provided with valve access ports 40 and 42 to accommodate a two way valve function. The remaining modules are provided with valve access ports 44, 46, 48 and 50 to accommodate a four way valve function. The porting is dictated by standard valve porting arrangements and appropriate bolt holes are provided to accept the valve body. Now referring to Figure 2, the representative valve mounting arrangement shown, has the four individual valve means, indicated generally at 51, mounted on four assembled manifold modules 20. The modules 20 upon which a four way valve is mounted are provided with outlet ports, such as at 52 and 54, for communication to external fluid power operative elements. Such elements typically consist of power cylinders or a control circuit interconnecting a plurality of valve functions which are then conventionally connected to a power element or the like. Conventional fittings such as straight fittings 56 or forty five degree fittings 58 may be employed to provide two different angular disposition for the connecting piping as desired. In the embodiment shown, the outlet ports are provided in face 36 which is disposed at approximately a forty five degree angle to the horizontal by use of a mounting bracket assembly indicated generally at 60. In this configuration, the valve mounting face 34 is horizontally disposed. Alternative arrangements are possible to select a different orientation in the field. The angular disposition of the valve mounting face and hence the valves, as well as the face provided with the outlet ports to external elements permit very flexible arrangements.For example, the forty five degree fittings are shown disposed at a ninety degree exit angle for connective piping. Merely rotating these fittings also provides a ninety degree vertically downward piping angle to be utilized as well as a horizontal disposition angled forty five degrees away from the disposition shown in Figure 2. In a similar fashion, the manifold assembly may be rotated forty five degrees, absent angled mounting bracket 60 to dispose face 36 carrying outlet ports 52 and 54 at a vertical disposition at right angles to the horizontal. This flexibility of valve and outlet port arrangement is a significant additional advantage of the manifold construction which so dramatically reduces the amount of material required as well as provides a saving in labour costs. Now specifically referring to Figures 3 7, a typical unit module 20 is shown. Bor descriptive purposes, the manifold unit module 20 shown is provided with a standard four way valve porting arrangement. Preferably, provision is made for pilot pressure and drain passages to accommodate this feature as needed. The main supply ducts 26 and 28, commonly referred to as bus ducts, extend through the manifold module 20 and are provided with standard straight threads 62 and a recess for a conventionalO ring seal 64. Valve access ports are provided in a standard pattern on face 34 at 44, 46, 48 and 50. Port 44 communicates with pressure supply duct 26 via internal passage 66. Port 48 communicates with tank return duct 28 via internal passage 68. Port 46 communicates with an actuator outlet port 52 and port 50 communicates with outlet port 54 via angular passages 70 and 72 respectively. Ports 52 and 54 are commonly referred to as cylinder ports in the industry since these ports are commonly connected to external fluid power cylinders by conventional piping or other means of interconnection to perform their conventional control function. These ports also could be connected in various manners to an externally located control circuit having a plurality of interconnected valve functions to obtain more complex control features without departing from the invention or sacrificing the primary advantages thereof. A plurality of drilled and threaded holes are conventionally provided in a standard pattern to acceptably mount the desired valve means upon face 34 and are indicated at 74. Drilled holes 76 are provided to accept conventional dowel pins typically provided in standard valve bodies to facilitate the mounting procedure. Pilot pressure and tank return bus ducts 78 and 80 are extended parallel to ducts 26 and 28 through the module 20. In instances wherein a pilot signal is desired to monitor the primary valve, pilot ducts 78 and 80 communicate via internal passages 86 and 88, which in turn communicates with pilot valve access ports 90 and 92 located on face 34. Construction ports 82 and 84 necessary to provide passages 86 and 88 are simply plugged and therefore are provided with conventional threads and O ring seals.Pilot ducts 78 and 80 are also provided with straight threads and appropriate O ring seals in the same manner as bus ducts 26 and 28. A pair of dowel pins 92 are provided on the outer face of the module which are adapted to fit in aligned bores, not shown, in an adjacent module 20 to facilitate alignment and assembly. It should be readily understood that the material savings resulting from the manifold system constructed in accordance with the present invention are equally applicable if the module concept is not employed as described herein. That is, a single base manifold block of greater length may be employed to form an equivalent system and no tie rods need be employed. Also it should be pointed out that the essentially triangular cross sectional configuration results in much more efficient use of the space required to provide the desired flow paths and bus duct flow capacity than the typical rectangular mode of the prior art. A forty five degree angular relationship between the valve mounting face and the other two major planar surfaces represent the optimum savings by providing the optimum in minimizing the material required and further provides a symmetrical configuration more convenient to design and locate the required flow paths and porting arrangements. The significant 25 to 30 percent material saving is occasioned by the more efficient pathway resulting when the access port passages approach the outlet port face at an angle less than ninety degrees. The closer one approaches the forty five degree relationship, the more material saving is realized. Another advantage of the present invention is presented in connection with using the angular bracket 60 to orient the valve mounting face in a given disposition. Bracket 60 includes a horizontal foot 61 and an angular brace member 63. In the embodiment shown, brace member 63 is provided with an inclined surface upon which the face 32 of a module unit 20 is conventionally attached by threaded fasteners or the like to dispose the manifold assembly in a given orientation. As seen in Figures 2 and 3, the valve mounting face 34 is disposed in a horizontal disposition with the other faces 32 and 36 disposed forty five degrees relative to face 34 as mounted on bracket 60. Referring to Figure 3, a pair of drilled and threaded holes 94 are provided in face 32 which are adapted to receive a threaded fastener extended through bracket 60. An alternative orientation of the manifold using a different mounting plate or bracket involves rotation of the manifold assembly fortyfive degrees to dispose face 32 in a horizontal position with the valve mounting face 34 inclined at a forty five degree angle and face 34 disposed in a vertical position. This feature provides a significant degree of flexibility in field applications when spacial requirements and arrangements of the manifold assembly and associated valves and connecting piping are limited. Further, it is readily seen that employing the concept and principles of the present invention do not require any particularly complex manufacturing technique. All major drilled holes and passages enter and exit a manifold face at right angles to the face. The shorter distance required to construct the major passages also leads to a reduction of machine time and a resultant labour savings. The present invention provides a supply manifold system for parallel and or series communication of a plurality of valve means to a common pressure duct which possesses all the advantages of the prior art drilled rectangular block manifold and yet dramatically reduces the cost of an equivalent system. Further advantages related. to flexibility of orientation in the field and economical manufacturing procedures are additionally realized.
