# An attachment for fitting to a drive spindle of a machine.

## Abstract
An attachment for fitting to a drive spindle of a machine, particularly with a rotary coolant adaptor for an automatic tool changing machine, comprises a rotary part 2 and a stationary part 4 . The stationary part includes a spring loaded pin 34 having an axial bore 36 to enable coolant to be supplied to a tool mounted in the adaptor. The pin 34 is spring loaded and, when the attachment is removed from the machine, the arm 46 mounted on the pin 34 engages a recess 18 in the rotary part 2 . When the attachment is fitted to the machine, the pin 34 is retracted, and the arm 46 disengages from the recess 18 . To enable the adaptor to be used with different machines, the recess 18 is provided in a ring 16 which surrounds the rotary part 2 and can be rotated relatively thereto to adjust the relative orientation of the stationary part 4 and the rotary part 2 when the attachment is removed from the machine. Screws 20 are provided for fixing the ring 16 securely in place when an adjusted position has been reached.
