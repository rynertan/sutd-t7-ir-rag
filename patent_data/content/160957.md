# ADHERENT ULTRAVIOLET CURED COATINGS

## Abstract
An ultraviolet curable liquid coating composition is disclosed which exhibits improved adhesion to metal and plastic surfaces. This composition comprises, in admixture 1 from 10 to 60 of the mixture of an organic solvent soluble solution copolymer of monoethylenically unsatu rated monomers free of amine functionality and including from 5 to 20 of an amide of a monoethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid, especially dimethyl acry lamide and 2 from 40 to 90 of the mixture of radiation curable ethylenically unsaturated liquid, preferably including a polyacrylate, such as pentaerythritol polyacry late, said coating composition including photoinitiators and or photosensitizers, and especially ketonic photoin itiators, rendering the composition sensitive to ultraviolet light. These components are usually present in solution in an organic solvent. The copolymer desirably contains from 0.5 to 10 of a monoethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid, like acrylic or methacrylic acid, and may contain at least 2 of an alkanol ether of N methylol acrylamide or N methylol methacrylamide and a strong acid catalyst may be present to enable a low temperature cure following the ultraviolet cure. A polyepoxide may also be present in the composition to aid intercoat adhesion.
