# Low voltage high speed logic circuit.

## Abstract
Logic circuit means for providing a binary output which is a predetermined logical function of a plurality of binary inputs, said logic circuit means including at least first, second and third push pull Darlington current sink PPDCS logic cir cuits, each said PPDCS logic circuit comprising first, second and third transistors T4, T5, T6 . The collector of said third transistor T6 is connected to a first source of potential V1 , and the emitter of said second transistor T5 is connected to a third source of potential ground . Input circuit means T1, T2, T3 are adapted to receive n binary inputs, connected to the collector of said first transistor T4 and the base of said third transistor T6 . A first resistor R1 is connected between the emitter of said first transistor T4 and a second source of potential V2 . A second resistor R2 is connected between said first source of potential V1 and a common connection of the base of said first transistor T4 and the base of said second transistor T5 . A third resistor R3 is connected bet ween the base of said third transistor T6 and said first source of potential V1 . A first diode D1 is connected across the base collector junction of said first transistor T4 . A second diode D2 is connected across the base collector junction of said second transistor T5 . Output circuit means connected in common to the collector of said second transistor T5 and the emitter of said third transistor T6 . Said output circuit means are electrically manifesting the logical binary NOR function of said n binary inputs received by said input circuit means T1, T2, T3 . The output circuit means of each of said at least first, second and third PPDCS circuits are interconnected.
