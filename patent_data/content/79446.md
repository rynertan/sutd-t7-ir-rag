# Phase locked circuits.

## Abstract
A phase locked loop circuit is disclosed in which the output of a controllable oscillator 50 is fed back to a phase comparator circuit receiving a reference phase input signal. The comparator circuit provides a phase error signal Vâ‚€ and this error signal is used to pull the oscillator into phase with the input signal. The control signal I
