# Composition board and method for its manufacture.

## Abstract
Particle board contains, as a fibrous material with good structural properties, at least a proportion of chicory root parti cles. Preferably the chicory is mixed with bagasse fibres to provide strength to the board, and a filler in the form of coffee grounds is included. The coffee and chicory constituents are conveniently obtained as wastes from the manufacture of in stant coffee.
