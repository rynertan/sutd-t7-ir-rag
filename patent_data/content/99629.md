# Method of producing carbon fibers.

## Abstract
A method of producing carbon fibers in which an exhaust gas generated in a heat treating stage of the production of carbon fibers is divided into two portions, one portion thereof being decomposed by the action of an oxidizing catalyst and subsequently being blended with the other portion, to be re used. According to said method, the heat loss in the exhaust gas disposal process can be substantially reduced and the efficiency of heat treating can be improved and in consequence, various troubles due to the decomposed products contained in the heat treating atmos phere such as surface damage, fuzziness and individual fiber breakage, etc. can be avoided. Apparatus for performing the method may comprise a main circulating duct 9 leading from the gas discharge chamber 6 to the gas charge chamber 8 of a furnace 3 . At a branch off point 10 a sub duct 12 leads via a heater 16 , blower 17 and a gas decomposer 18 containing a catalyst to a confluence point 11 , with a heater 14 and blower 15 being located in the duct 9 between the confluence point 11 and the gas charge chamber 8 .
