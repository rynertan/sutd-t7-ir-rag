## Description
The present invention relates to an immunosensor and more particularly to a potential causing element for use in an immunosensor. Immunosensors are used to determine relatively large proteins or polypeptides through an antigen antibody reaction. In a typical analysis with an immunosensor, a potential causing element electrode or membrane having an antigen or an antibody thereon is immersed in a solution containing a corresponding antibody or antigen . A potential electric potential caused across the electrode or the membrane due to the formation of an antigen antibody complex is detected to determine qualitatively or quantitatively the presence of the corresponding antibody or the antigen . The immunosensor potential causing electrode as mentioned above has typically been prepared in one of the following manners The former method can be carried out by treating titanium wire or tungsten wire, as the electrode body, with an acid such as hydrochloric acid so as to form an oxide film thereon, followed by a treatment with an aqueous solution containing cyan bromide. The resultant electrode is then immersed in an antigen or antibody containing solution to bind or fix the antigen or antibody thereon. In the latter method, the surface of the electrode body is coated with a film of a polymer, such as cellulose acetate, sephadex, polystyrene or polyacrylamide, by means of solution coating, covalent bonding, electrodeposition or vaporization techniques. An antigen or an antibody is then fixed onto the surface of the coated electrode body. An immunosensor potential causing element can also be used in the form of a membrane. Such a membrane is typically prepared by coating a glass plate with a solution containing triacetyl cellulose or collagen. The resultant film of triacetyl cellulose or collagen is removed from the glass plate and then subjected to a treatment by which an antigen or an antibody is bound or fixed onto the triacetyl cellulose or the collagen film. As can be seen from the above, the conventional methods require rather sophisticated techniques for obtaining the electrodes or the membranes for immunosensors. Particularly, it is hard with such methods to control the processing parameters so as to obtain a membrane or an electrode which will develop the desired immunoresponse suitable for use in an immunosensor. US A 4 334 880 describes an analytical device with a semiconductive polyacetylene element. The polyacetylene of the element is associated with a binding substance having specific affinity for the analyte. The semiconductive properties of polyacetylene are utilized for determining the concentration of the analyte. In the presence of the analyte, the semiconductive element varies its resistance and in order to measure the respective resistance, an external voltage is applied.

Stability of conducting polythiophene and derivatives describes the preparation of conductive polymers, such as polythiophene, polyfuran, and derivatives which appear as interesting candidates for organic electrodes for energy storage or display. Document D3 FR A 2 384 789 describes the use of dialdehydes and an amine in the fixation of biological binding substances to a polymer. The primary object of the present invention is to provide a novel potential causing element for use in immunosensor, which can be prepared in a relatively easy manner to obtain desired immunoresponse characteristics. The present inventors have found that this object can be accomplished by the use of polypyrrole or polythiophene as the polymer film onto which an antigen or an antibody is bound. Polypyrrole and polythiophene are polymers having the following repeating units, respectively. While these polymers are known as functional polymers which will exhibit photoresponse or electrical conductivity, no disclosures or suggestions have been found that they can be used as materials for electrodes or membranes for immunosensors. The present inventors perceived that polypyrrole or polythiophene can be prepared by means of electrolytic polymerisation, in which the operating parameters can be easily controlled to produce polypyrrole or polythiophene film suitable for use as the immunosensor element when an antigen or an antibody is bound thereon. Thus, it has been found by the present inventors that polypyrrole or polythiophene will provide highly sensitive membrane or electrodes for immunosensors, particularly when produced as a film having a specific range of thickness. The present invention therefore provides a potential causing electrode for use in immunosensors, comprising a film of polypyrrole or polythiophene bound with an antigen or an antibody and an electrode body overcoated with said film, in which said polypyrrole film or polythiophene film preferably has a thickness in the range of about 0.05 µm to about 0.25 µm. There is further provided according to the present invention a potential causing element, in the form of a membrane, for use in an immunosensor, comprising a film of polypyrrole or polythiophene bound with an antigen or an antibody, in which said polypyrrole film or polythiophene film preferably has a thickness in the range of about 0.5 µm to about 5 µm. The potential causing element according to the present invention can be prepared through electrolytic polymerization electrochemical polymerization of pyrrole or thiophene, by the process as described below, which is another aspect of the present invention. For the electrolytic polymerization pyrrole or thiophene is dissolved in a solvent to form a solution. The solvent is a polar solvent which will dissolve pyrrole or thiophene monomer but will not dissolve polypyrrole or polythiophene polymer . Such solvents may be exemplified by nitriles such as acetonitrile and benzonitriles amides such as dimethyl formamide amines such as pyridine ethers such as tetrahydrofuran and 1,4 dioxane acids such as acetic acid alcohols such as methanol and ethanol. There may also be included such solvents as propylene carbonate, nitromethane, methylene chloride, acetone, methylethyl ketane, water and the like. Pyrrole or thiophene is dissolved in one or more of these solvents, in a concentration generally in the range of 20 to 200 milimoles l. In forming the electrolytic polymerization solution, it is preferable, depending upon the type of solvents, to add an electrolyt such as tetraalkylammonium boron tetrafluoride, tetraalkylammonium perchlorate, tetraalkylammonium phosphorus hexafluoride, and tetraalkyl hydrogensulfate, in which the alkyls have 1 to 10 carbon atoms. For example, when a nitrile such as acetonitrile is used as solvent, it is preferable to add tetraalkylammonium boron tetrafluoride, tetraalkylammonium perchlorate or the like in an amount of 50 to 100 milimoles l. 1,4 Dioxane, propylene carbonate, acetone or nitromethane is used concurrently with the addition of tetrabutylammonium boron tetrafluoride or tetraethylammonium perchlorate in an amount of 50 to 100 milimoles l. When a relatively conductive solvent such as water is used, the addition of an ordinary inorganic salt, a buffer solution and tetraethylammonium is preferred. In the electrolytic polymerisation solution containing pyrrole or thiophene thus prepared, there are placed a working electrode an electrode on which the polypyrrole film or polythiophene film is to be formed and a counter electrode, while a reference electrode e.g. Ag AgClO₄ electrode may also be concurrently used. As materials for the working electrode, there may be mentioned metals such as platinum, aluminum and gold metal oxides such as tin oxide and titanium oxide semiconductive substances such as silicone and gallium arsenide and carbonaceous substances such as graphite and glassy carbon. These electrodes can be used in any shape known in the art. The electrolytic polymerization of pyrrole or thiophene is carried out by the passage of electricity through the solution between the electrodes, preferably with oxygen dissolved in the solution having been removed, and most preferably under an atmosphere of nitrogen. Immediately after the passage of electricity is started, the film of polypyrrole or polythiophene black in color starts to be formed on the working electrode electrode body . One of the notable advantages of the present invention, in which a polymer film polypyrrole film or polythiophene film is prepared through electrolytic polymerization, is that the thickness of the film can be easily controlled so as to obtain an immunosensor potential causing element which will exhibit desired immunoresponse characteristics. Thus, the film thickness or the film formation rate is determined by electric charge and current density, depending upon the type of solvent used and other operating parameters. For example, in a case where acetonitrile is used as solvent, a polymer film of a thickness of about 50 to 250 nm is produced by the electric charge of 20 to 100 mC cm² at a current density of 20 to 100 µA cm², while the use of an aqueous solvent for producing a polymer film of the same thickness requires about ten times as much current density and about 5 to 20 times as much electric charge. In a case where an electrolytic polymerization solution is added with a fixation improving binding improving agent as described later, a higher current density and a higher electric charge are required for producing a polymer film of the same degree of thickness. For the purpose of improving the physical strength or workability of the polypyrrole film or the polythiophene film, the monomer containing solution for the electrolytic polymerization may be added with film strengthening agent s such as acetyl cellulose e.g. bromoacetyl cellulose or triacetyl cellulose in an amount of about 1 to 2 . In such case, the solvent system must be so selected that it will sufficiently dissolve the film strengthening agent as well as pyrrole or thiophene. For example, when triacetyl cellulose is used, a mixture of solvents, such as acetonitrile plus methylene chloride 3 2 , is preferably used. The electrode body working electrode on which a polypyrrole film or a polythiophene film has been formed in the manner as described above is then immersed in a solution containing an antigen or an antibody for binding or fixing the antigen or the antibody thereon, following a washing operation. Alternatively, the polypyrrole film or the polythiophene film is separated or exfoliated from an electrode body, washed and then immersed in an antigen or antibody containing solution for obtaining a potential causing element rather than a potential causing electrode. A preferred solution containing an antigen or an antibody is, for example, one which has been adjusted to pH 7.0 with a phosphate buffer. The operation of immersing the polymer film formed electrode or the polymer film in the antigen or antibody containing solution must be carefully conducted so that the antigen or the antibody is bound or fixed onto the polymer film in a highly dense and homogeneous state in order to prevent the adsorption of any non specific substance, i.e. reactions other than the desired antigen antibody reaction which is to be detected by the immunosensor. The prevention of such non specific adsorption may be enhanced by the treatment of the antigen or antibody fixed electrode or film membrane with a suitable agent such as BSA bovine serum albumin . The fixation or binding of an antigen or an antibody onto the polymer can be carried out concurrently with the polymerization of pyrrole or thiophene by adding in advance the antigen or the antibody into a pyrrole or thiophene containing solution for electrolytic polymerization where an aqueous solvent is used. In such case, there is no need of adding an electrolyte since the antigen or the antibody per se serves as an electrolyte. This procedure is advantageous in that the polypyrrole film or polythiophene film on which an antigen or an antibody is fixed can be produced in a single step. It has been found that the fixation or binding of an antigen or an antibody onto the polymer is highly improved by a treatment with dialdehydes such as glyoxal, malondialdehyde, succinaldehyde, glutaraldehyde and adipinaldehyde, or amines such as allylamine, 1,8 octanediamine, 4 amino methyl 1,8 octanediamine and hexamethylene diamine, and mixtures thereof. Thus, in a preferred embodiment according to the present invention, a polypyrrole film or polythiophene film coated electrode or a polypyrrole film or polythiophene film produced by the electrolytic polymerization is treated with a solution containing the dialdehyde or diamine as described above, prior to the immersion of such electrode or film into the antigen or antibody containing solution. Alternatively, the dialdehyde or amine may be present in the polymerization solution containing pyrrole or thiophene so that the treatment with such a dialdehyde or amine is carried out concurrently with the polymerization. The polypyrrole film or polythiophene film thus treated with the dialdehyde or diamine is found to have a highly improved fixation binding characteristic with an antigen or an antibody, thereby providing a potential causing element electrode or membrane with a high immunoresponse. If necessary, the polypyrrole film or polythiophene film, on which an antigen or an antibody is fixed or bound, can be treated with sodium hydrogen borate or the like so as to stabilize the fixation between the polymer and the antigen or the antibody and also improve the degree of freedom of the fixed antigen or antibody. Any type of antigen or antibody can be bound or fixed onto the polypyrrole film or polythiophene film according to the present invention. Such antigens or antibodies include various immunoglobulins IgG, IgM, IgA, etc. , anti immunoglobulins, albumines, and hCG. The antigen or antibody fixed polypyrrole or polythiophene film prepared in the above mentioned manner can be used as a potential causing element for an immunosensor, in the form of an electrode in which an electrode body is coated with the antigen or antibody fixed film, or in the form of a membrane in which the antigen or antibody fixed film is used singly. The thickness of the potential causing element in the form of a membrane is preferably about 10 to 20 times as large as that of the element in the form of an electrode, since it is difficult to exfoliate an extremely thin film from the electrode body. It has been found that polypyrrole film is more preferable than polythiophene film as the former is easier to be handled as a membrane and exhibits higher fixation characteristics with an antigen or an antibody. Figure 1 illustrates a typical example of immunosensor system including an electrode 10 according to the present invention, which comprises an antigen or an antibody bound polypyrrole or polythiophene film overcoating an electrode body, and a reference electrode 11. The reference electrode 11 is any suitable electrode used in the art, such as saturated calomel electrode and Ag AgCl electrode. The working electrode 10 is immersed in an antibody or an antigen containing solution 12 in a container 16. The solution 12 is connected with the electrode liquid of the reference electrode through a connecting tube or bridge 14 having a filter 13. Thus, the electric potential more specifically, the change in the potential caused across the working electrode 10 due to antigen antibody reaction is detected by a voltmeter not shown , while the solution 12 is preferably stirred with a stirring device such as a magnetic stirrer 15. The solution containing the antibody or the antigen is usually a saline solution, PBS or the like. Figure 2 illustrates an example of immunosensor system where an antigen or an antibody bound polypyrrole or polythiophene is used as it is, i.e. in the form of a membrane, for measuring the membrane potential more specifically, the change in membrane potential due to the antigen antibody reaction. Thus, the system of Figure 2 includes the antigen or the antibody bound polypyrrole or polythiophene membrane 21 provided between two saturated calomel electrodes 23, 24 as reference electrodes. The membrane 21 is mounted on a glass tube 28 containing a dilution liquid a saline solution or PBS 29, the concentration of which is about one tenth of that of a saline solution or PBS used to prepare a solution containing an antibody or an antigen to be detected. The electrode 23 is connected with the liquid 29 through a bridge 25 while the electrode 24 is connected with the solution 22 in a container 30 through a bridge 26. The measurement of a membrane potential across the membrane 21, preferably while stirring the solution 22 with a magnetic stirrer 31, with such system provides the detection of the aimed antibody or the antigen in the solution. Examples will be given below for better understanding of the present invention. A solution for electrolytic polymerization was prepared by dissolving pyrrole and tetraethylammonium boron tetrafluoride, each being at the concentration of 0.1 mole l, in acetonitrile. In the solution thus prepared are immersed a working electrode made of platinum wire 1 mm in diameter and 4 mm in length and a counter electrode made of platinum plate. The passages of electricity under an atmosphere at the current density of 20 µA cm² with varying electric charge resulted in platinum electrodes overcoated with polypyrrole film of varying thickness which was measured by an electron microscope. Such film thickness can be expressed in terms of electric charge mC cm² as shown in Figure 3, where the electric charge of 80 mC cm² was found to correspond to the thickness of about 200 nm 0.2 µm under this process condition. Each of the polypyrrole film overcoated electrodes was immersed for 20 minutes in a solution containing anti IgG at the concentration of 2.32 x 10 ³ mg ml so as to fix the anti IgG on the polypyrrole film. The change in electrode potential ΔE mV was measured before and after the fixation of the anti IgG, the change being a criterion or measure of the degree of the fixation. The results were given in Figure 3, which demonstrates that the polypyrrole film highly adsorbs the anti IgG. It is particularly noted that the film having a thickness of about 50 to 250 nm corresponding to the electric charge of 20 to 100 mC cm² exhibits a good response. With the same solution for electrolytic polymerization as used in Example 1, six electrodes were prepared by forming a polypyrrole film on working electrodes of platinum wire each being 1 mm in diameter and 6 mm in length , followed by the fixation of IgG on the film, under the conditions described below Each of the Electrodes A through F was immersed, as working electrode in the immunosensor system as shown by Figure 1, in a solution containing anti IgG at the concentration of 8.52 x 10 ³ mg ml. Measurement was made, with each Electrode, of the potential more strictly, the change in electric potential , ΔE mV, caused while the Electrode was immersed in the anti IgG containing solution. The results are given in Figure 4, which demonstrates that all the Electrodes exhibit immunoresponse. It is particularly noted that the Electrodes B, C, D, E and F which have been prepared by the methods including the fixation improving treatment with amine or dialdehyde exhibit remarkable immunoresponse characteristics. The immunoresponse of Electrode F was measured with anti IgG containing solutions with varying concentrations of the anti IgG, in the manner as described in Example 2. The results are given in Fig. 5, which demonstrates that the detection of anti IgG can be sufficiently made as low as about 10 ⁵ mg ml by using the electrode according to the present invention. The results are also summarized in Fig. 6 in terms of the potential change after 20 minutes against the logarithmic concentration of anti IgG, which provides a good linearity. It was found that a linearity for calibration can also be obtained with respect to other lapses of time after the immersion of the electrode in the solution. A solution for electrolytic polymerization was prepared by adding IgG in an aqueous solutin saturated with pyrrole, so that the concentration of IgG was 15 mg ml. In the polymerization solution thus prepared was immersed a platinum electrode 0.5 mm in diameter and 5.8 mm in length as a working electrode. Electrolytic polymerization was conducted under the atmosphere of nitrogen at a current density of 1 mA cm2 and an electric charge of 400 mC cm² 100 µA, six minutes to obtain a polypyrrole film coated platinum electrode with the IgG being fixed on the film where the thickness of the film is 100 nm 0.1 µ . The electrode thus obtained was used as a working electrode in the immunosensor system as illustrated in Fig. 1 to determine the immunoresponse to anti IgG containing solutions of varying anti IgG concentrations, with satisfactory results as shown in Fig. 7. With an electrolytic polymerization solution as used in Example 1, electrolytic polymerization was carried out at an electric charge of 1.6 C cm² to form a polypyrrole film on a platinum plate, followed by washing with acetonitrile or in distilled water to obtain a membrane having a thickness of 4 µm. The membrane was treated with a mixture of 4 aminomethyl 1,8 octanediamine and 50 aqueous solution of glutaraldehyde 10 1 by volume for one day and then immersed in a solution containing IgG at a concentration of 150 mg ml for two days so as to fully fix the IgG on the membrane. The membrane after the immersion was used as a working membrane in the immunosensor system as illustrated in Fig. 2 to determine its immunoresponse to anti IgG. As a result, there was observed a clear change in electric potential, which fact indicates a high adaptability of the membrane to the immunosensor. For comparison, measurement of membrane potential was done with an IgG fixed membrane made of triacetyl cellulose which has been prepared by the conventional technique as mentioned previously, with the result that there was observed an extremely low response, i.e. about one tenth as low as that with the membrane of the present invention. An IgG fixed polythiophene membrane was prepared by using thiophene instead of pyrrole in Example 5. The IgG fixed polythiophene membrane was found to exhibit a good response to anti IgG although slightly lover than the polypyrrole membrane in Example 5 .
