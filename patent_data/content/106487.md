## Description
IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO NOVEL BRIDGED HEXAHYDROBENZ f ISOQUINOLINES It has long been known that slight chemical modifications of the morphine molecule lead to analgesic agonists of widely differing potencies and addictive properties. For example, codeine, the methyl ether of morphine, is a relatively mild analgesic agonist having only slight dependance addiction probabilities. On the other liana, heroin, the diacetyl derivatives of morphine, is a powerful agonist with extremely high addiction potential.In addition, as long ago as 1915, Pohl found that wh n the 8 methyl group of codeine was replaced with an allyl group, the resulting compound, N allylnorcodeine, was an opiate antagonst. In 1940, N allylnormorphine or nalorphine was synthesized and was shown to have a highly specific ability to reverse the depressant effects of morphine.Other simple chemical modifications of the morphine molecule have yielded many interesting drugs. Thus, one fruitful research area in the search for improved analgesic of high potency or lower addiction potential has been the chemical modification of the morphine molecule. In addition to chemically modifying the morphine ting structure, chemists have developed a second related field of research the preparation cf compounds containing only part structures of morphine with the same end in mind as above i.e., the synthesis of. improved analgesic agonists and or analgesic antagonists of improved properties, For example, meperidine, a widely used analgesic, can be written as a morphine part structure, as can the benzomorphans and the prodines. Many other compounds of morphine partstructures have been prepared, some of which have improved analgesic agonist properties and others, particularly those with an allyl group attached to a ring nitrogen, which have opiate antagonist properties.It had been hoped that morphine part structure research would produce a compound having both opiate agonist and antagonist properties since the opiate antagonist property would assure a user that the compound would have a greatly reduced dependance liability. Two recently marketed analgesics, pentazocine and phenazo cine, have been found to be both antagonists and agonists although they still retain a certain degree of opiate dependance liability. Recently, two groups have prepared isoquinoline analogs of the prodines and or the benzomorphans. Nenard, et al., Can. J. Chem., 52, 2316 1974 , pre pared several octahydrobenz fjisoquinolines which were reported to possess analgesic activity. All of the compounds prepared and tested were substituted at the lOb position with hydroxy or acyloxy. Hahne, et al., Arch. Pharm., 312, 472 1979 , reported the preparation and analgesic activity of octahydrobenztf isoquinolines which are not substituted in the benzene portion of the molecule. In accordance with the present invention, novel bridged hexahydrobenzEr isoquinoline derivatives are useful as analgesic agents, having both narcotic agonist and antagonist properties, as well as psycho tropic characteristics. Accordingly, compounds or formula I ,EMI3.1 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in which R1 is hydrogen, hydroxy, C1 C4 alkoxy, orCl Cl2 alkanoyloxy R R2 is hydrogen, C1 C8 alkyl, C2 C6 alkenyl methyl, C3 C cycloalkyl methyl, EMI3.2 in which p is 0, 1, or 2 Y isEMI3.3 CH2 , O , S , or NH providing that when Y is O , S , or NH , p may only be 2, and providing that whenY isEMI3.4 p may not be 0 Z is O or S R5 is C1 C4 alkylthio, nitro, amino, trifluoromethyl, hydroxy, hydrogen, C1 C4 alkyl, C1 C4 alkoxy, or halo R6 is hydrogen, C1 C4,alkyl, C1 C4 alkoxy, or halo R4 is hydrogen or methyl R3 is C C alkyl or hydrogen and n is 1 or 2, are useful analgesic and psychotropic agents. In a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a process for preparing the compounds ofFormula I which comprises a Reducing a compound of Formula II ,EMI4.1 to form a compound of Formula. I in which R3 is hydrogen or, b Reacting a compound of Formula II of step a , in which R1 is hydrogen or C1 C4 alkoxy, with an organometallic reagent to form a compound of Formula I in which R3 is C1 C8 alkyl or, c Hydrolysis or reduction of a compound of Formula I in which R1 is C1 C4 alkoxy or C1 C12 alkanoyloxy, to form a compound in which R1 is hydroxy or, d Acylation or alkylation of a compound of Formula I in which R1 is hydroxy to form a compound of Formula I in which R1 is alkanoyloxy or alkoxy or, e Treatment of a compound of Formula I , in which R2 is C OW where W is C1 C4 0 alkyl, benzyl or phenyl, with a base to form a compound of Formula I in which R2 is hydrogen or, f Reacting a compound of Formula I in which R2 iS hydrogen, with an alkyl halide, or acyl halide followed by reduction1 to form a compound of Formula I in which h is other than hydrogen and, g if desired, salifying a product of any of reactions a f . The term C1 C8 alkyl refers to straight and branched alkyl radicals of one to eight carbon atoms and includes methyl, ethyl, n propyl, isopropyl, tertbutyl, hexyl, octyl, and includes the terms C1 C4 alkyl and C2 C4 alkyl11. The term C2 C6 alkenylmethyl refers to straight, and branched alkene radicals of two to six carbon atoms attached to a methyl radical, such as 2 propenyl allyl , 2 butenyl, 3 butenyl, or 2 pentenyl. The term C3 C8 cycloalkyl methylw refers to a methyl radical substituted with saturated alicyclic rings of three to eight carbon atoms, such as cyclopropylmethyl, methylcyclopropylmethyl, cyclobutylmethyl, cyclopentylmethyl, cyclohexylmethyl, 1 , 2 , 3 , or 4 methylcyclohexylmethyl, cycloheptylmetnyl, or cyclooctylmethyl. The term C1 C4 alkoxy refers to the straight and branched aliphatic ether radicals of one to four carbon atoms such as methoxy, methoxy, propoxy , isopropoxy, butoxy, isobutoxy, sec butoxy, or tert butoxy, and includes the term C2 Co alkoxy . The term Cl Cl2 alkanoyloxy refers to straight and branched aliphatic acyloxy radicals of one to twelve carbon atoms, such as formoyl, acetoxy, propionyloxy, pentanoyloxy, 4 butyloctanoyloxy, and lauroyloxy. The term halo refers to fluoro, chloro, bromo, and iodo. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts, including quaternary ammonium salts, of the amine bases represented by the above formula are formed with aei ds, and include, for example, salts derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, nitrous acid, or phosphorous acid, as well as salts derived from organic acids including aliphatic mono and dicarboxylic acids,phenyl substituted alkanoic acids, hydroxy alkanoic and alkanedioic acids, aromatic acids, aliphatic and aromatic sulfonic acids. Such pharmaceutically acceptable salts may include sulfate, pyrosulfate, sulfate, sulfite, bisulfite,nitrate, phosphate, monohydrogenphosphate, dihydrogenphosphate, metaphosphate, pyrophosphate, chloride, bromide, iodide, fluoride, acetate, propionate, decanoate, caprylate, acrylate, formate, isobutyrate, caprate, heptanoate, propiolate, oxalate, malonate, succinate, suberate, sebacate, fumarate, maleate, mandelate, butyne 1,4 dioate, hexyne 1,6 dioate, benzoate, chloro benzoate, methylbenzoate, dinitrobenzoate, hydroxybenzoate, methoxybenzoate, phthalate, terephthalate, benzenesulfonate, toluenesulfonate, chlorobenzenesulfonate, xylenesulfonate, phenylacetate, phenylpropionate, phenylbutyrate, citrate, lactate, D hydroxybutyrate, glycollate, inflate, tartrate, methanesulfonate, propanesulfonate, naphthalene l sulfonate, or naphthalene 2 sulfonate. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are those salts useful in the chemotherapy of warm blooded animals. The usual nonreactive solvents used in the preparation of the salt from the base include, for example, acetone, tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether, or ethyl acetate. Quaternary salts can be prepared in generally the same way by reaction of the base with an alkyl sulfate or alkyl halide, for example, methyl sulfate, methyl iodide, ethyl bromide, and propyl iodide. The inorganic acid salts, especially the hydrochloride salts, are preferred. The preferred compounds o this invention are those in which a R1 is C1 Ca alkoxy, especially methoxy, b R1 is hydroxy, c R2 is hydrogen, d R2 is C1 C4 alkyl, especially methyl, e R2 is C2 C6 alkenylmethyl, especially 2 propenyl allyl , f R2 is cyclopropylmethyl, g R2 isEMI8.1 especially 2 phenylethyl, h R3 is hydrogen, and i n is 1. Especially preferred are those compounds wherein R1 is at the 9 position of the molecule. The bridgehead ring at 4a and lOb has a cis relationship and since both the 4a and lOb carbon atoms are asymmetric, the compounds occur as optical isomer mixtures designated as the cis dl pair. Formula I is thus intended to comprehend the cis dl mixture, and the individual enantiomorphs, namely the cis l and cis d compounds, since as far.as is known, all of the individual isomers and isomer mixtures are useful as psychotropic agents and as analgesic agonists or as analgesic antagonists, albeit larqe quantitative differences in agonist or antagonistic potency may exist between individual isomers or mixtures. WhereR3 is other than hydrogen, an additional chiral center is present both possible isomers and their mixture are contemplated by this invention. The novel compounds of this invention are prepared according to scheme I Scheme IEMI9.1 In scheme I, R2, R3 and n are the same as described earlier, R1 is hydrogen or nethoxy, Rl isC2 C4 alkoxy or C1 C12 alkanoyloxy, X is chloro, bromo, or iodo, and W is C1 C4 alkyl benzyl, or phenyl. A l tetralone A R1 is methoxy or hydrogen is converted to the corresponding R11 sub,stituted l hydroxy l methyl 1, 2,3, 4 tetrahydronaphthalene B by treatment with a methyl Grignard reagent in the usual manner. Treatment of the hydroxy intermediate B with a dehydrating agent, such as polyphosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, or p toluenesulfonic acid in a solvent such as benzene, xylene, toluene, or the like with the concurrent removal of water, usually at elevated temperatures, results in the loss of water and the formation of a R1 substituted 1 methyl 3,4 dihydronaphthalene C . Aminomethylation of the latter intermediate with two equivalents of formaldehyde, and the appropriateR2 amine gives a R1 substituted 3 R2 substituted 1,2,3,4.5, 6 hexahydrobenzlf isoquinoline D which is the required intermediate for all subsequent transformations. Treatment of the R11 substituted 3 R2 sub stituted 1,2,3,4,5,6 hexahydrobenz f isoquinoline D with a strong base, such as n butyl lithium, sodium anode, or methyl lithium, in a compatible solvent, such as ethers, tetrahydrofuran, alkanes, such as hexane, and the like, preferably at low temperatures, for instance OOC. to 78 C., followed by the additionof the resulting anion to a solution of the desired alkane dihaiide X CH2 CH2 n CH2 X , results in the preparation of. the corresponding Rl substituted lOb haioalkyl substituted 3 R2 substituted 1,2,3,5,6,10b hexhydro benz f isoquinoline E .In the formula of the above halide, n is 1 or 2 and each of X and X is independently chloro, bromo, or iodo. Although the reaction will proceed when X and X are the same, the preferred reactant is one where X and X are different, especially where one of X and X is chloro and the other of X and X is bromo. Thus, the preferred reagents are l bromo 3 chloropropane and l bromo 4 chlorobutane. When X and X are different, the resulting compound of structure E will have the halo radical X of lesser atomic weight eg, if a bromo chloroalkane is used, the resulting compound E will be the chloro derivative. The haloalkyl intermediate E is transformed to the bridged intermediate F by heating in a nonreactive solvent with an alkali metal iodide. This treatment serves to form the propano or butano bridged ring and shift the double bond to the iminium species which is complexed with the iodide ion. Suitable nonreactive solvents may include acetonitrile, dioxane, or diglyme. Potassium iodide or sodium iodide may be employed as the alkali metal iodide. The reaction is typically carried out at temperatures ranging from 40 C. to the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture, the latter being preferred to expedite the reaction.Under reflux conditions, the reaction is usually complete within 6 to 48 hours, depending upon the solvent and nature of the alkane dihalide employed. The iminium iodide intermediate F is transformed into compound G by one of several means, depending upon the nature of the R3 group to be introduced. When the desired product of Formula I is unsubstituted. at the 4 position R3 is hydrogen , intermediate F is reduced by. any of a number of methods well known to those skilled in the art. More specifically, the reduction can be accomplished by reaction with hydride reagents such as, for example1 sodium borohydride, diborane, lithium aluminum hydride, or sodium bis 2 methoxyethoxy aluminum hydride. The hydride reduction reactions are generally carried out in the presence of a suitable solvent, for example, ethers such as diethyl ether, dipropyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, diglyme, or in alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, or isopropanol.Weak acids, such as formic acid or acetic acid, can be added to the reaction mixture if desired, thereby making the reduction more efficient. A preferred reduction method, for example, comprises treating the iminium iodide derivative with sodium borohydride in the presence of a suitable solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran. The amount pf reducing agent used can vary over a wide range. Generally, the amount of reducing agent.used Is in excess of the iminium iodide derivative, normally from about 1 to about 10 molar excess however, more or less can be used if desired The reaction is usually carried out at a temperature below about 1800C,, although the precise temperature is not critical. Preferably, the reactants are mixed while the temperature is maintained at about 0 to about 200C. After the reactants have been combined, the temperature can be increased, preferably to a temperature from about 500 to about 1500C. Normally, the reduction is complete within about 1 to about 4 hours.The product can be recovered by making the reaction mixture alkaline, for example by adding an aqueous base such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, or ammonium hydroxide, and extractina the aqueous alkaline reaction mixture with a water immiscible organic solvent, such as, diethyl ether, ethyl acetate, or dichloromethane. The reduction of the iminium iodide compound F can alternatively be accomplished by hydrogenation.The hydrogenation is preferably carried out in an unreactive solvent such as, for example, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, ethanol, methanol, water, or N,N dimethylformamide, under neutral, acidic, or basic conditions. The particular solvent used is not critical, but preferably the solvent selected is one in which the iminium iodide derivative will be at least partially soluble. The hydrogenation is carried out in the presence of a suitablecatalyst such as Raney nickel, platinum oxide, platinum, or palladium on a suitable carrier such as carbon or barium sulfate The particular reaction conditions are not critical to the process, but generally the hydrogenation is carried out at a temperature of about 250 to about 2000C.,with a hydrogen gas pressure of about 20 to about 100 p.s.i. Alternatively, F may be reacted with aGrignard reagent R3MgX or lithium reagent . R3Li wherein R3 and X are the same as previously defined, in the usual manner to give the 4 R3 substituted compounds of this invention. Compounds of structure H are prepared by the cleavage of the methoxy group G, R1 is methoxy to the corresponding phenol using known methods such as treatment with hydrobromic acid and acetic acid, or boron tribromide, for example. Such methods of ether cleavage are well known to those in the art see for example U.S. Patent No. 3,324,139.The phenol compounds are useful as analgesic agents and additionally serve as intermediates to C1 C4 alkoxy and C1 C12 acyloxy derivatives J, Rlii is C1 Co alkoxy or C1 C12 alkanoyloxy . These phenols may be, alkylated with C1 C4 alkyl halides in which C1 C4 alkyl and halide are as defined previously, optionally, in the presence of an acid binding agent, such as sodium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, triethylamine, or magnesium hydroxide, to give the appropriate alkoxy substituted 3 R2substituted product J, R111 is C1 C4 alkoxy .Typically, equimolar quantities of the phenol and the alkylating agent are stirred together, preferably in a non reactive solvent, including amides such as dimethyl formamide or dimethylacetamide, or sulfoxides such as dimethyl sulfoxide, at temperatures from anout 0 C. up to the reflux temperature of the solution, preferably at about ambient temperature. The alkanoyl derivatives are similarly prepared by the action of an appropriate C1 C12 alkanoyl halide on the phenol in like manner to also provide compounds of structure J R1 is C1 C12 alkanoyloxy . Alternatively, the appropriate substituted 1,2,3,4,5,6 hexahydrobenzlE isoquinolines G, especially where R2 is methyl may be dealkylated to the corresponding 3 hydrogen compound L by treating the compound with a haloformate to provide a carbamate K, W is C1 C4 alkyl, benzyl, or phenyl which gives a secondary amine when treated with a base. This type of reaction is described in more detail by Abdel Monen andPortoghese, J. Med. Chem., 15, 208 1972 . In particular a haloformate such as, phenyl chloroformate, ethyl bromoformate, or benzyl chloroformate, is reacted with a tertiary amine, for example a 3 methyl isoquinoline derivative in the present case, to afford a carbamate. The reaction is generally carried out in an unreactive solvent such as dichloromethane, chloroform, acetone, or ethyl acetate.The temperature is usually held below about 2000 C., and the reaction is substantially complete within about 1 to 5 hours. The product carbamate K can be isolated by simply evaporating the reaction solvent,, and further purification of the product is generally not needed. The carbamate K , is converted to the 3 hydrogen compound by the action of a suitable base such as aqueous sodium hydroxide or aqueous potassium carbonate . A suitable .. organic solvent is normally added to the reaction mixture in order to dissolve the carbamate. Suitable solvents may include alcohols suc as ethanol or methanol, or ethers such as dioxane or tetrahydrofüran. The hydrolysis reaction is generally complete within about 12 to 36 hours when carried cut at a temperature of about 500 to about 1500C. The product may be isolated by extracting the aqueous reaction mixture with a suitable solvent such as diethyl ether or methylene chloride. The unsubstituted compound L can be further purified by methods such as chromatography, crystallization, distillation, or the like. These 3 hydrogen compounds L are useful analgesic agents and also may be transformed into the corresponding methoxy Rl substituted 3 R2 substituted 1,2,3,4,5, 6 hexahydrobenz fJ isoquinolines M in the usual manner, or the methoxy functionality may be cleaved to the phenol N using hydrobromic acid acetic acid. The phenol N may then be alkylated at the 3position with a R2 halide as before t6 yield Pj and subsequently alkylated at the phenol position with a R1 halide to give Q if desired. The alkylation of a phenol derivative R1 is hydroxy and most of the 3 hydrogen derivatives R2 is hydrogen may be performed in the usual manner with the appropriate alkyl halide reagents in the presence of an acid binding agent. The reactants are generally mixed in about equimolar quantities, preferably in an organic solvent. Typical solvents commonly used include amides such as dimethylformamide or dimethylacetamide, or sulfoxides such as dimethyl sulfoxide.Generally, a base is added to the reaction mixture to act as.an acid binding agent. Typical bases include sodium bicarbonate, potassium carbonate, magnesium hydroxide, or triethylamine. The alkylation is generally complete after about 1 to about 16 hours when carried out at a temperature of about 20 to 1200C, The products are isolated by general methods and further purified if desired. If R1 is hydroxy and R2 is hydrogen, the 3 position will be selectively alkylated with one equivalent of halide, although alkylation at the phenol position will occur if more than one equivalent of halide is employed. The introduction of certain R2 substitutents may additionally be accomplished by treating the 3hydrogen derivative with an appropriate acyl halide, followed by reduction of the resulting carbamate. This process may be used when there is to be a methylene group adjacent to the nitrogen atom. For instance, C3 C8 cycloalkyl methyl compounds may be formed by using a C3 C8 cycloalkyl carboxylic acid halide, followed by reduction. The 2 phenylethyl functionality may be introduced by using a phenylacetyl halide, followed by reduction. Typically, the carboxylic acid chloride is used, usually in the presence of an acid scavenger, such as triethylamine, or sodium bicarbonate, in a compatible solvent, such as benzene, dimethylformamide, or dioxane.The carbamate intermediate may be isolated and re duced to the methylene compound with, for instance, lithium aluminum hydride inotetrahydro furan. In a similar manner, the R2 substituents in which Y isEMI17.1 may be transformed into the corresponding alcohol and methylene compounds by partial or total reduction of the ketone. In Scheme I, l tetralone and all four methoxy tetralones A are commercially available and thus give the corresponding hydrogen and methoxy compounds of this invention G . This provides, through cleavage of the methoxy compounds to the corresponding phenol and subsequent alkylation or acylation, an efficient synthesis to R1 substituted compounds of this invention.

The compounds of this invention are valuable psychotropic and analgesic agents for treating animals suffering from pain. The analgesic potencies of the compounds of Formula I are comparable to that of meperidine as demonstrated, for instance, in the standard mouse writhing assay. The compounds are not morphine like when tested in mice, and have demonstrated narcotic antagonist like properties. The analgesic activity of a number of compounds provided by this invention has been determined in the standard rat tail jerk assay and the mouse writhing assay. Mouse Writhing Inhibition Assay Writhing, characterized by contraction of the abdominal musculature, extension of the hindlegs, and rotation of the trunk, was induced in Cox standard strain albino male mice. The mice, weighing 18 24 grams, were fasted overnight and given the test compound by gavage in an acacia suspension 5 sixty minutes before writhing was induced by the intraperitoneal administration of acetic acid 0.60 percent .Each treatment group consisted of 5 mice. The total number of writhes for the treatment group was determined during a 10 minute observation starting 5 minutes after acetic acid administration. Control groups had a total of 40 60 writhes per observation period. Table I shows typical test results obtained with the claimed compounds. The results in the mouse writhing assay are presented as the effective dos in mg. kg of the tested compound required to inhibit induced writhing in the test animals by fifty percent ED50 . Results are presented in Column II for both subcutaneous s.c. and oral p.o. administration of the test compound as compared to the reference compound meperidine.

Such formulations are useful in the treatment of pain in warm blooded animals. The formulations contemplated comprise an analgesically effective dose of a compound of the invention in combination with any of a number of pharmaceutical diluents, excipients and carriers.Typical diluents commonly used in such formulations may include lactose, sucrose, starch, micro crystalline cellulose, calcium sulfate, or sodium benzoate. Typical formulations will contain from about l to about 30 percent by weight of active ingredient. The formulations can be compressed into tablets or encapsulated in gelatin capsules for convenient oral adminis.ration. Alternatively, the formulations can be dissolved in sterile water or saline and placed in a suitable vial for convenient intravenous or intranscular administration. The compounds of the invention have demonstrated valuable analgesic activity, and therefore are useful in the treatment of pain. The invention thus further provides a method for imparting analgesia in an animal which comprises administering an analgesically effective dose of a compound of the invention.Typical doses commonly administered will range from about 0.5 to about 150 mg. per kg. of animal body weight. A preferred dose will be from about 1.0 to about 50 mg. kg. The method of treatment can be accomplished by administering an analgesic compound of the invention via the oral or parenteral routes. Preferred routes of administration include the oral and intramuscular routes. Subcutaneous administration of the suitably formulated active compounds can also be utilized when desired.
