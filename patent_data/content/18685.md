# Method of improving the heat radiation properties of an X ray tube rotary anode.

## Abstract
In an X ray tube rotary anode having a supporting body 1 of molybedum alloy, a target 2 of tungsten alloy, and a rough tungsten layer, applied by flame spraying to the whole surface of the anode except the focal path 4 , for improving heat radiation, the rought tungsten layer does not adhere well to the tungsten alloy target, and particles of the rough tungsten layer may become detached in use, degrading the performance of the X ray tube. To alleviate this problem, the whole surface of the anode, except the focal path 4 , is blasted with steel grit, steel grit particles embedded in the anode are removed with acid, and the whole surface of the anode, except the target 2 , is coated with a rough tungsten layer 3 by plasma spraying.
