# Process for matching the demand for electrical energy to the supply of electrical energy as well as a circuit used for this purpose.

## Abstract
Process and circuit for matching the demand to the supply of electrical energy of one or more alternative energy sources which supply electrical energy to a consumer block or blocks, wherein as little as possible energy is drawn from the networks resp. is supplied thereto. The power available and consumed as well as the power to be consumed are constantly compared and dependent on this comparison the influenceable consumer apparatuses are controlled and switched according to time priorities inserted by the users. A circuit for a single building is indicated in figure 1, wherein via a control panel 8 and controller 9 the influenceable consumer apparatuses are controlled. This circuit may form a component of a number of interrelated units, which are controlled by a central controller.
