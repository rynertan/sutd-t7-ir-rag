# Method of fabricating metal silicide gate electrodes and interconnections.

## Abstract
A method for constructing titanium silicide integrated circuit gate electrodes and interconnections is disclosed. The method finds particularly useful applications in metal oxide semiconductor integrated circuit fabrication. Following stan dard active and passive circuit component construction, a thin film of titanium 40 is overlayed on the die structure covering thereby the pre patterned polysilicon gates 18, 36 and interconections. The die is then rapidly heated and baked to form a silicide layer 42 superposing said polysili con. The undesired titanium layer over other areas can be stripped using simple ammonium hydroxide hydrogen etching and cleaning solution. Titanium silicide electrodes and interconnections are self aligned and have a sheet resistance of 1 to 5 ohms per square.
