# Display tube and method of manufacturing a display screen for such a display tube.

## Abstract
Corrosion of the aluminium film 17 of the display screen of a display tube as a result of an electro chemical reaction between water and aluminium is prevented sub stantially by providing the aluminium with an aluminium phosphate layer 20 at the area where it adjoins the carbon particles 18, 19 . This may be done by rinsing or spraying the carbon particles with an at most 2 by weight phosphor ic acid solution in water prior to or after providing the aluminium film.
