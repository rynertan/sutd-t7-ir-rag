## Abstract
A piston and cylinder assembly is provided having an elon gate rod like piston 1 slidably housed in a bore 2 in a cylinder 3 to project from an open end 4 of the cylinder bore 2 and a gland assembly 5 for sealing between the cylinder bore 2 and the outer surface 6 of the piston 1 . The gland assembly 5 includes a through bored housing member 7 secured at one open end 7a to the cylinder at its open end 4 to extend around the piston 1 with the respective bores 2, 70 extend ing coaxially and opening into one another and with the hous ing member bore 7b being larger in diameter than the cylinder bore 2 and piston 1 to define an annular chamber 8 around the outer surface of the piston 1 , which chamber 8 is bounded at its innermost end, immediately adjacent the cylinder bore end 4 , by a first end wall 9 extending generally transversely to the longitudinal axes of the housing member and cylinder bores 7b, 2 and at its outermost end by a second end wall 11 extending generally transversely to the longitudi nal axes of the housing member and cylinder bores 7b, 2 and provided on an annular end closure means 12 removably at tachable to the housing member 7 at the other open end of the housing member 7 . A flexible annular guide ring 14 , split operipherally in the direction of its longitudinal axis, is provided locatable in the chamber 8 around and in sliding guide contact with the piston outer surface 6 adjacent the first end wall 9 , and a flexible annular seal ring 16 locatable in the chamber 8 around and in sliding sealing contact with the piston outer sur face 6 between the guide ring 14 and the second end wall 11 . The arrangement is such that the seal and guide rings 16, 14 may be entered into and removed from the chamber 8 by means of the removable end closure means 12 and in opera tion of the piston and cylinder assembly, with pressure fluid peratively present in the cylinder bore, the seal ring 16 is urged into sealing contact with the piston outer surface 6 by being compressed between the second end wall 11 and fluid pressure acting on an innermost end face of the seal ring 16 through the peripheral split in the guide ring 14 .
