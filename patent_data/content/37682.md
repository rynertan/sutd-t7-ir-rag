# Method of and apparatus for applying a coating to a web of sheet material.

## Abstract
In an offset gravure web coating method and apparatus, coating composition is applied from a gravure roll to a trans fer roll, thence to an applicator roll, and finally to the web. The web moves in the same direction as the applicator roll surface. The ratio of the speed of the applicator roll surface to that of the web is preferably not greater than 1 1. The method and apparatus afford improved coating patterns at low wet coat weights.
