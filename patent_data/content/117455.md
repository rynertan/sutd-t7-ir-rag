# Multiplex magnetic recording and reproduction system.

## Abstract
In a video tape recorder of the helical scan type, a pair of rotary magnetic heads 9a, 9b for the audio signal are pro vided in addition to the rotary video heads 8a, 8b so that the audio signal is recorded on the same slant track as of the video signal on a multiplex basis. The audio head pair is provided with azimuth angles ϑ₁, ϑ₁ of opposite polarities from each other and different in value from those of the video head pair, ϑ₂, ϑ₂ . The system has the first operation mode of the standard tape speed and the second operation mode in which the tape is fed at a speed, for example, 1 3 the standard tape speed. The audio and video head pairs are disposed on lines intersecting at right angles with an offset of T₁ 2 T₁ provided in the axial direction of rotation between the two magnetic head pairs, where T₁ is the track pitch of the record ing track formed on the tape in the second operation mode. The system produces overlapping tracks for the audio and video signals on the magnetic tape. In the first operation mode, the recording track is formed by a combination of magnetic heads providing an increased difference of azimuth angles be tween the audio and video heads, while in the second opera tion mode, the track is formed by a combination of magnetic heads providing a decreased difference of azimuth angles be tween the audio and video heads.
