# Catalysts for hydroformylation of olefinically unsaturated compounds and process utilising the catalysts.

## Abstract
A novel catalyst composition useful in hydroformylation reactions comprises cobalt carbonyl and a porphyrin promo ter ligand. Aldehydes may be manufactured in increased yield at less severe operating conditions by contacting an olefinically unsaturated compound, carbon monoxide and hydrogen in the presence of such catalyst. A representative porphyrin promoter ligand is meso tetra 4 carboxyphenyl porphyrin. Where acrylonitrile is used as the olefinically unsaturated compound, the product is 3 cyanopropionaldehyde.
