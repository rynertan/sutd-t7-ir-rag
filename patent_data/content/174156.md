# Charge load support for a glow discharge furnace.

## Abstract
A charge load support for a glow discharge furnace comprises first and second 1, 2 tubular members of electrically insulating or semiconducting material, the first member 1 being arranged within the second member 2 and being connected thereto at one end 3 such as to provide a space 4 between the first and second members 1, 2 throughout the unconnected length of the second member 2 , the first member 1 extending beyond the second member 2 at the other end of the first and second members 1, 2 , with a cap member 5 closing the other end of the first member 1 and having a rim 6 extending about the other end of the second member 2 and spaced therefrom to provide a re entrant entry 7 to the space 4 between the first and second members 1, 2 . The second member 2 serves to protect the first member 1 from a build up of conductive deposits thereon, while the cap member 5 serves to prevent the entry of such deposits into the space 4 between the members 1, 2 .
