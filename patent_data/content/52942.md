# Photoimaging process.

## Abstract
A method for producing a photopolymer image compris ing a exposing, imagewise, a photosensitive element to actinic radiation, said element comprising a substrate coated with a photosensitive layer containing dispersed silver halide particles in operative association with a continuous film forming phase of polymeric coupier, said coupler having i a number average molecular weight of about 2,000 to 100,000. ii a content of about 10 to 100 milli equivalents per 100 g of polymeric coupler of acidic methylene coupler groups and about 15 to 175 mill equivalents per 100 g of polymeric coupler of at least one of carboxylic, sulfonic and phosphonic acid groups, and iii the ability to couple with a monofunc tional developing agent thus becoming water insoluble b developing insolubilizing the latent image and c remov ing the undeveloped, soluble portion of the photosensitive element by washing with aqueous solvent.
