# High voltage connector.

## Abstract
A high voltage connector is provided for interconnecting a power cable to an apparatus such as a transformer. The cable is securely coupled to the connector, which is then mounted on to the transformer bushing. The bushing and cable electrical contacts inside the connector are spaced apart, and electrical connection is achieved therebetween by inserting a continuity plug into a socket of the connector. Electrical isolation between the cable and transformer may be effected without physically moving either piece of equipment, by removing the continuity plug and replacing it with another plug that introduces sufficient electrical insula tion between the equipment contacts to allow operating and test voltages to be applied to one of the cable and transformer without flashover occurring to the other of said pieces of equipment. Other interchangeable plugs may provide earthing for a selected one of the pieces of equipment also without requiring physical movement of the equipment.
