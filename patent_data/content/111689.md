# METHOD OF STORING A B TREE TYPE INDEX FILE ON ROTATING MEDIA DEVICES

## Abstract
Index data is organized in main storage and on cyclically addressable media device such as diskette, disk or drum so that addresses of any index entry in the index is accom plished with one access mechanism seek plus on the average of one rotation of the media. The lowest two levels of the index structure are stored on the media device such that a next to the lowest level node and its related leaf nodes are cyclically addressable. The higher level of the index structure is organized as a B tree index and stored in the main storage.
