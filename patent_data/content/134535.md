# 1,6 Naphthyridin derivatives useful as cardiotonics and preparation thereof.

## Abstract
4 R 5 Q 1,6 naphthyridin 2 1H ones 1 , where R is hydrogen or methyl and Q is hydroxymethyl, 1 hydroxy ethyl alkanoyloxymethyl or 1 alkanoyloxyethyl, are pro duced by first reacting 4 R 5 acetyl or n propanoyl 6 2 di lower alkylamino 2 1H pyridinone III with hydroxylamine or salt thereof to produce 4 R 5 Q 1,6 naphthyridin 2 1H one 6 oxide II , where R is defined as above and Q is methyl or ethyl next reacting II with an alkanoic anhydride to produce I where Q is alkanoyloxymethyl or 1 alkanoyloxyethyl and, then hydrolyzing said alkanoyloxy methyl or ethyl compound to produce I where Q is hydroxymethyl or 1 hydroxyethyl. Also shown is the car diotonic use of II and I where Q is hydroxymethyl, 1 hydroxyethyl or alkanoyloxymethyl.
