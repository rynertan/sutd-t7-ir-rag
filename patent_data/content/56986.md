# Method of preparing a plated shaped product.

## Abstract
In electroplating of a shaped product of a composition comprising a polyamide, the incorporation of powdery wollastonite as a filler in a content of 30 to 60 by weight based on the composition is effective in forming a plated film on the shaped product, the plated film having an excellent appearance and a high adhesive strength. Prior to said electroplating, the use of a 4 to 15 by weight aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid for etcing can enhance the adhesive strength markedly.
