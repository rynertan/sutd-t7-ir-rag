## Description
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS FOR NASAL ADMINISTRATIONOF ANTICHOLINERGIC QUATERNARY AMMONIUM SALTSThe present invention relates to the nasal administration of anticholinergic quaternary ammonium salts containing in the molecule a phenyl group and the nitrogen atom quaternized in a 5 or 6 membered cyclic system and to the pharmaceutical compositions containing them.Among the anticholinergic compounds used in antispasmodic therapy the quaternary ammonium salts containing in the molecule a phenyl group and the nitrogen atom quaternized in a 5 or 6 membered system have the advantage not to penetrate the blood brain barrier so that the undesired central side effects are avoided.It is known that these anticholinergic quaternary ammonium salts are widely used therapeutically exibiting a particularly high spasmolytic activity in spastic conditions of the gastrointestinal tract, of the extrahepatic biliary ducts, of the urogenital and bronchial apparatus.These salts are also used for instrumental investigations like for example gastroduodenal endoscopy.Typical representatives of this class of compounds are, for example, the following MEPENZOLATE BROMIDEEMI1.1 METHSCOPULAMINE BROMIDEEMI2.1 FENPIVERINTUM BROMIDEEMI2.2 NOVATROPINEEMI2.3 GLYCOPYRROLATEEMI3.1 DIPHEMANIL METHYLSULFATE EMI3.2 CLIDINIUM BROMIDEEMI3.3 PRIFINIUM BROMIDEEMI3.4 FENTONIUM BROMIDEEMI4.1 HEXOCYCLIUM METHYLSULFATEEMI4.2 SCOPOLAMINE BUTYLBROMInEEMI4.3 SCOPOLAMINE N CYCLOPROPYLMETHYL BROMIDEEMI4.4 However this class of compounds is poorly and variably absorbed after oral administration. For this reason these compounds are preferably used therapeutically by the intermuscular or intravenous route.The therapeutic limitation of these compounds is evident when the oral administration is essentially the only one feasible route of administration as in the case of the irritable colon.The poor oral bioavailability of these compounds requests the need of their best absorption. Consequently it is an object of the present invention to provide a new method for administration which provides both a greatly enhanced bioavailability as compared to oral intake and a more convenient administration of these compounds as compared than intravenous, intermuscular or rectal routes. This latter is not feasible in some diseases, for example, in case of the irritable intestine.This object has been achieved by nasal administration of these compounds advantageously formulated as solution, suspension, cream, ointment, gel, drops or spray adapted for this new administration route. This is proved by the results herein described demonstrating that this new route of administration is suitable for systemic therapy in that it shows a bioavailability about 20 times superior to that S the oral administration. In fact the urinary excretion of these compounds after nasal administration both in solution and in semisolid formulation is about 23 of that observed after the intravenous administration. On the other hand, the urinary excretion observed after oral administration achieves only 1.4 of that obtained after the intravenous administration. In addition to the increased bioavailability the new route of administration with adapted pharmaceutical compositions allows a sustained release of these compounds so that a therapy without provoking undesired side effects is possible.The present invention provides any pharmaceutical composition acceptable for the nasal administration consisting essentially of i anticholinergic quaternary ammonium salts containing in the molecule a phenyl group and the nitrogen atom quaternized in a 5 or 6 membered cyclic system, and ii a non toxic pharmaceutically acceptable nasal carrier, in order to obtain after nasal administration an appropriated systemic absorption of the active ingredient.According to the present invention we have unexpectedly found that these compounds can be administered by nasal route with a bioavailability considerably superior to that obtained after oral administration.As a representative drug of is class of compounds Ncyclopropylmethylscopolamine bromide was employed in the method and in the compositions according to the present invention. The bioavailability of this compound after administration by nasal and oral route has been examined and then compared by the following general method.The investigated drug was administred in equal doses by the nasal, oral and intravenous route. 6, 12 and 24 hours after administration the quantitative excretion into the urine for any of the routes of administration was studied. The total amount of the drug excreted during the investigated time intervals was expressed as percentage of the intravenously eliminated amount, considering the latter value as an equivalent for 100 bioavailability.In detail the following studies have been carried out.For each experiment 10 male Sprague Dawley rats, weighing 280 20g have been used. For the i.v. administration rats fasted for 18 hours were anaesthetized by intraperi toneal sodium pentobarbital solution 2 ml kg corresponding to 60 mg kg rat. A 4 solution of the drug in buffered saline pH 7.4 was injected into the femoral vein 50 ,jl rat corresponding to 2 mg of the active ingredient .For the oral administration 18 hours fasted and conscious rats received an 0.2 solution of the drug in saline by means of a stomach tube 1 ml rat corresponding to 2 mg of the active principle . For the nasal administration the investigated compounds, for example N cyclopropylmethyl scopolamine bromide, was administered to 18 hours fasted and as above described anaesthetized rats at a dose of 2 mglrat. This dose corresponds either to 24vU1 of saline 4S solution or 5 mg of a 20 gel introduced into both nasal cavities by means of micropipette. After the administration by any route the animals were transfered into metabolic cages and received 3 ml of water by stomach tube. The urine was collected 6,12 and 24 hours after administration and the excreted drug was determined with the following original method which is based on the binding affinity of the drugs to their pharmacological receptors. In fact, it is known that compounds that possess receptor affinity, in this case muscarinic anticholinergics, are able to bind to the receptor proportional to their affinity. It follows from this that knowing the affinity of the drugs it is possible to assay the concentration of the drugs in biological fluids. For this a suitable in vitro receptor preparation and a radio ligand that can bind specifically to the receptor and can be displaced by the test compound is needed. In the present invention tritiated N methylscopolamine 3H NMs in a final concentration of 3.10 10M that occupies 50 of the muscarinic receptors was employed.As in vitro receptor preparation we used a homogenate from rat cerebral cortex diluted 1 3000 in 20 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl and 10 mM MgC12 pH 7.4 . After incubation of 3H NMS with the receptor preparation receptor bound ligand was separated from free ligand by centrifugation and the amount of the receptor bound ligand was measured as radioactivity dpm in the pellet.In Figure 1 the ability of N cyclopropylmethylscopolamine bromide to displace 3H NMS from the muscarinic receptor of cerebral cortex is shown. It is evident that increasing concentrations of N cyclopropylmethylscopolamine bromideDA 3177 br abscissa inhibit the specific binding between 3H NMs and receptor in a dose dependent manner see fig. 1 .Since the scope of the present invention was to study the bioavailability of quaternary anticholinergics by determining their urinary excretion, it was necessary to demonstrate that the urine per se does not interfere with muscarinic receptor binding. Figure 2 shows that the urine of non treated animals diluted 50 to 500 fold with the above mentioned HEPES buffer does not influence the binding of the radioligand with the receptor see fig. 2 .Therefore, on the basis of the standard curve Fig. 1 and having clarified that the urine per se does not interfere with muscarinic receptor binding Fig. 2 it is possible to determine the amount of quaternary anti cholinegrics excreted into the urine.The following tables report the urinary excretion of N cyc lopropy lmethylscopolamine bromide in each investigated rat and for the considered different routes of administrat ions.

In fact, as can be seen from Table 5, the urinary excretion after this administration by nasal route results nearly constant in both the intervals, between 0 6 hours and between 6 12 hours only decreases between 12 24 hours.These results clearly show that prolonged release of Ncyclopropylmethylscopolamine bromide can be achieved via nasal administration in suitable formulations.Any of the selected drugs intended for therapeutic use according to the present invention can be administered nasally to warm blooded animals conveniently by pharmaceutical formulation acceptable to nasal dosage form comprising the desired drug in a therapeutically effective amount i.e. depending on the selected drug,on the effective amount of the selected drug suitable for antispasmodic activity etc. together with a non toxic pharmaceutically acceptable nasal carrier therefor.Suitable non toxic pharmaceutically acceptable nasal carriers will be apparent to those skilled in the art of nase pharmaceutical formulations. For those not skilled in the art, reference is made to the text entitled REMINGTON S PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES11, 16th edition, 1980. Obviously the choice of suitable carriers will depend on the exact nature of the particular nasal dosage form desired , e.g., whether the quaternary ammonium salt is to be formulated into a nasal solution for use as drops or as a spray , a nasal suspension, a nasal ointment or a nasal gel. Preferred nasal dosage forms are solutions, creams and gels which contain a major amount of water in addition to the active ingredient.Minor amounts of other ingredients such as preservatives, buffering agents, wetting agents and jelling agents may also be present.This type of composition can be used in the treatment of all different therapeutic indications in which the selected drug is effective also after the other routes of administration.Obviously the therapeutic dosage range for nasal admi nitration of the anticholinergic quaternary ammonium salts according to the present invention will vary with the size of the patient, the condition for which the drugs are administered, and of course, with the activity of any of the selected drugs intended for use.A typical dose of N cyclopropylmethylscopolamine bromide would be 5 to 50 mg administered nasally three times daily. The doses of the other selected drugs intended for use in the present invention would be 1 to 200 mg identically administered,The quantity of nasal dosage form needed to deliver the desired dose will of course depend on the concentration of drug in the composition.The volume of solution or gel which would be needed e.g. to deliver N cyclopropylmethylscopolamine bromide in the doses specified above would be 0.05 to 0.5 ml of 10 solution or 0.05 to 0.5 g of cream and 0.025 to 0.25 g of 20 gel or ointment.Examples of typical nasal pharmaceutical compositions containing N cyclopropylmethylscopolamine bromide are set forth below, However it is to be understood that these compositions are given by way of illustration only and are not to be considered as limiting the invention either in spirit or in scope as many modifications both in materials and in methods will be apparent to those skilled in the art.EXAMPLE 1 10 grams of N cyclopropylmethylscopolamine bromide are dissolved in 80 ml of distilled water at 500C.
