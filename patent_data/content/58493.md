# Fiber treating compositions comprising two organo functional polysiloxanes.

## Abstract
Fiber treating compositions are disclosed which contain two types of organofunctional polysiloxanes, one bearing amino functional organic groups and polyoxyalkylene groups and the other bearing either carboxy functional organic groups of epoxy functional groups, in addition to polyoxyalkylene groups. These compositions are useful for durably treating fibers to provide several benefits such as antistatic character, moisture perspiration absorbability, stain resistance, pliabili ity, smoothness, crease resistance and compression recov ery.
