## Description
MEASUREMENT OF ELECTRICAL RESISTIVITY IN BOREHOLE This invention relates to measuring the electrical resistivity of materials in the vicinity of an apparatus located in a borehole, and more particularly to measuring electrical resistivity of earth formations at diffferent lateral distances from the borehole. It is known that measuring formation resistivity at several lateral distances from a well bore facilitates determination of characteristics of the fbrmation relating to oil and gas production. A deep measurement will give the apparent formation resistivity RD, a shallow measurement will give the invaded zone resistivity Rs, while a very shallow measurement of the formation immediately adjacent the borehole will give flushed zone resistivity R xo The resistivity values may be used to determine when invasion has taken place, thereby detecting zones that have some permeability. Among other information, these logs are useful in detecting movable hydrocarbons present in the formation intersected by the borehole. A number of resistivity measuring tools employing various electrode arrays are disclosed in the prior art.Such arrays may comprise multiple pairs of electrodes, spaced on either side of a central electrode conventionally designated as A . For example, in Figure 6 of U.S. patent 0 No. 2,712,627 to Doll, an electrode array is shown having eight measurement and current electrodes located above and below a central, principal current emitting electrode A 0 Similarly, U.S. Patent No. 3,772,589 to Scholberg discloses an electrode array having ten measurement and current electrodes located above and below a central electrode A oThe electrodes are symmetrically positioned about the A 0 electrode and shorted together in pairs to provide an electrode array which is electrically symmetrical about electrode A .Different ones of the electrode pairs 0 are driven to induce current in the formation at different frequencies, and voltages are measured by the measurement electrode pairs to provide an indication of formation resistivity at different lateral depths of investigation. Similar systems having focussing and measurement electrodes centered about one or more central current emitting electrodes are disclosed in U.S. Patent No.3,882,376 to Schuster U.S. patent No. 3,462,679 toAttali U.S. Patent No. 3,365 658 to Birdwell andU.S. Patent No. 4,319,192 to Chemali et al. Prior art focussed current resistivity measurement systems have one disadvantage in that they do not provide an adequate or consistent focussing in non homogeneous earth formations. For example, when an electrode array is intersected by an earth formation boundary, inconsistent radial depth of the survey current and uncontrollable geometrical bias of the survey current can result. Furthermore, depth resolution of the formation resistivity measurements in the prior art is sometimes not adequate to locate the exact depth of producable zones in the earth formation.The portion of the formation which is useful for producing oil and gas is often only a few feet deep, thus it is vitally important that a resistivity measuring device has adequate depth resolution. We have now devised a well logging method and apparatus which is capable of simultaneously measuring resistivity of an earth formation at a plurality of lateral distances from a borehole and which provides improved depth resolution for such measurements. According to the present invention, a resistivity measurement apparatus includes an array of electrodes having a central survey current electrode and at least one pair of focussing current electrodes including an upper current electrode spaced above the central current electrode, and an independent lower current electrode spaced below the central current electrode. Voltage measurement electrodes are provided above and or below the central current electrode. A current driving circuit produces a survey current flow and focussing current flows in the formation being logged. At least one control loop is provided responsive to the voltage measurement electrodes to control the amount of current driven through the upper and or lower current electrodes.Such an arrangement may be employed to compensate for differences in resistivity of the tool environment above and below the central current electrode.respectively. Additional electrodes and independent control loops can be provided to permit resistivity measurements at a plurality of lateral depths from the borehole. The resistivity of the formation can be calculated from measurements of the current flow through the central current electrode and of a voltage measured at at least one of the voltage measurement electrodes. In a preferred embodiment, the apparatus of the present invention includes an array of electrodes having a central current electrode Ao, at least one pair of current electrodes including an upper and a lower current electrode spaced above and below the central current electrode Ao, respectively, and upper and lower voltage measurement electrodes located above and below the central current electrode Ao. Current driving circuitry drives a focussed survey current from the electrode array through the materials in the vicinity of the apparatus. The current driving circuit is responsive to the upper measurement electrodes to control the current driven through the upper current electrode.The current driven through the lower current electrode is controlled by the current driving circuitry independently of the upper current electrode in response to the lower measurement electrode. The resistivity of the materials in the vicinity of the apparatus is determined from measurements of the current flow through the central current electrode and of the voltage at at least one of the voltage measurement electrodes. In a further preferred embodiment, the current electrodes include a first pair of current electrodes having an electrode A3 spaced above the current electrode Ao and an elec trode A3, spaced below the central current electrode A . A second pair of current electrodes includes an electrodeA4 spaced above the electrode A3 and an electrode A4 spaced below the electrode A3 . The upper voltage measurement electrodes are located between electrode A 0 and electrode A4, and the lower voltage measurement electrodes are located between electrode A and electrode A .In o 4 the shallow mode, the current driving circuitry drives electrodes Ao, A3 and A3 synchronously at a frequency F5 in order to generate current from electrodes A and 0 A3 to electrode A4 and from electrodes Ao and A3 1 to electrode A4 in order to provide a shallow focus for the survey current. In the deep mode, the current driving circuitry drives electrodes Ao, A3, A31, A4 and A41 synchronously at a frequency FD in order to generate a deep focussed current between the electrode array and a remote electrode. Ideally, the frequency F5 is harmonically related to and greater than the frequency FD. In order that the invention may be more fully understood, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a schematic representation of one embodiment of focussed current well logging instrument in an operative position Fig. 2 is a diagram showing the well logging down hole electrode array and the focussed currents generated thereby, wherein the deep mode of operation is represented on the left hand side of the diagram and the shallow mode of operation is illustrated on the right hand side of the diagram Fig. 3 is a schematic diagram of the shallow mode survey current drive and measurement circuitry and Fig 4 is a schematic diagram of the deep mode survey current drive and measurement circuitry. Referring to Fig. 1, a borehole 2 is drilled into the earths surface and a focussed current well logging tool 4 is lowered into the bore hole 2 by a winch 6 and pulley 8. As shown, the logging tool 4 may include an insulating mandrel 10 including an array of electrodes arranged thereon and suspended in the borehole by a multiconductor cable 12. The lowermost portion of the multiconductor cable may be provided with an insulating cover 14 which electrically isolates the cable 12 from the conductive drilling mud 16 in the bore hole 2. A current return electrode 18 is mounted on the insulating cover 14 for use in measuring the deep formation resistivity, and a spontaneous potential electrode 20 may be employed to measure the spontaneous potential generated by electrochemical differences between the drilling mud 16 and the formation.The surface equipment 21 transfers electrical power to the logging tool 4 via the cable 12 and records measurement data transmitted by the logging tool 4.Typically, the surface equipment 21 will generate plots of measured resistivities at various formation depths as well as other related curves. A fish electrode 22 is deployed from the surface equipment, typically into a pit of conductive drilling fluids, in order to provide a remote electrical potential reference for the logging tool 4. The electrode array on the insulating mandrel 10 may comprise a central current electrode Ao and a first electrode pair comprising opposed upper and lower current electrodes A3,A31 and a second electrode pair comprising upper and lower current electrodes A4, A4 . The reference to the electrodes being upper or lower or being located above or below the central electrode is intended only to indicate the relative spatial positions of the electrodes when the tool is oriented vertically.A plurality of voltage measurement electrodes M1, M2 and M3 may be mounted on the insulating mandrel 10 between central current electrode Ao and upper current electrode A3, and voltage measurement electrodes M1 , M21 and M3 may be mounted on the lower part of the electrode array between central current electrode Ao and lower current electrode A3 . Auxiliary measurement electrodes A is mounted between current electrodes A3 and A4, and auxiliary measurement electrode A is mounted between current electrodes A3 and A4 . It is not necessary that the central current electrode Ao be located at the geometric midpoint of the electrode array, but merely that it be central in the sense that corresponding opposed electrodes are arranged on opposite sides of the central current electrode Ao. A general description of the operation of the deep and shallow modes of the focussed current resistivity measuring tool 4 will be given with reference to Fig. 2, which schematically depicts representative current flow paths in the shallow mode of operation right hand side and the deep mode of operation left hand side . Though in actual operation the generated currents will be alternating currents wherein the current flow direction alternately reverses at the current drive frequency, for ease of description the currents will be described as flowing in a single direction only. A detailed description of the current drive circuitry for the shallow mode and deep mode will be given below with reference to Figs. 3 and 4, respectively. In the shallow mode of operation, the current electrodes Ao, A3r and A3 are synchronously driven by a sinusoidal drive current having a frequency Fs that is the drive currents supplied to each of the current electrodes Ao, A3 and A3 , are of the same frequency and are in phase with one another.The shallow mode drive current creates a potential difference between the drive electrodes Apl A3 and A31 and the shallow mode current return electrodes A4 and A4t. Thus, a guard current Igs flows between the current electrode A3 and the electrode A4, and a guard current 1gas flows between the current electrode A3 and the electrode A4. The guard currents Igs and Igsl force the shallow resistivity measuring currents Ios and 1os to flow outwardly for a relatively short lateral distance so that it passes through the shallow portion of the formation rather than through the conductive drilling mud to the electrodes A4 and A4 , respectively. In the deep mode of operation, allof the current electrodes Ao, A31 A3l, A4 and A4 are synchronously driven by a deep mode sinusoidal drive current having a frequency FD. Preferably, the deep mode drive current is harmonically related to the shallow mode drive current and has a lower frequency than the shallow mode drive current. For example, the shallow mode drive current might be the eighth harmonic of the deep mode drive current and therefore have a frequency FS which is eight times the frequency FD of the deep mode drive current. As is well known in the art, various operating parameters would affect the actual values selected for the drive currents.Preferably, the deep mode survey current has a frequency on the order of 50 Hz.Deep resistivity survey currents IOD flow between the central current electrode Ao and the remote current return electrode 18 mounted on the insulating cover 14 of the multiconductor cable 12 Fig. 1 . Alternatively, an exposed portion of the cable 12 could act as the current return electrode. The deep mode guard currents Igd produced by the current electrodes A3 and A4, and the guard currents Igd produced by the current electrodes A3 andA4 inject the survey currents 1od to a deep portion of the formation in order to obtain a deep resistivity measurement. Thus, the deep survey currents 1od penetrate into the formation in a direction substantially perpendicular to the vertical axis of the borehole 2 for a relatively deep lateral distance. Turning now to Fig. 3, the shallow mode current drive circuitry includes an A controller having an oscillator which supplies a power amplifier 26 with a shallow sinusoidal drive signal at a frequency of F8. The power amplifier 26 establishes a potential difference across the primary winding of a transformer 28. The secondary winding of the transformer 28 is connected at one terminal with the current electrode A4 and at the other terminal with the central current electrode Ao. Current electrodes A4 and A41 are short circuited by a conductor 30. The potential difference established between the central current electrode Ao and the current electrodes A4 and A41 causes survey currents los Fig. 2 to flow between the electrodes. The level of the drive signal supplied to the power amplifier 26 is adjusted by the Ao controller to provide a desired voltage ampli tude on the current electrodes. Several different types of controllers are known in the art and include controllers which provide a constant current output, controllers which provide a fixed voltage between electrodes, and constant power output controllers. The A3 and A3 current electrodes are independent of one another. They may be controlled by separate but identical controllers. As shown in Figure 3, the A3 electrode is connected to one terminal of the secondary winding of a transformer 36, the other secondary winding terminal being connected to the current electrode A4. A power amplifier 34 establishes a potential difference across the primary winding of the transformer 36 in response to a drive signal from the A3 controller 32. The drive signal from the A3 controller has the same frequency FS as the drive signal from the Ao controller, and is in phase with the drive signal. Thus the guard current Igs flowing between the electrodes A3 and A4 is of the same frequency FS and is in phase with the shallow survey current Ions.This result can be obtained by having the A0 and A3 controllers share a common oscillator, in which case the individual controllers control the amplitude of the drive signal. Alternatively, each controller could have its own oscillator and electronic controls could be provided to synchronize the separate oscillators. As mentioned earlier, the guard current Igs forces the shallow survey current Ios to travel laterally into the formation for a given distance. By adjusting the amplitude of the A3 drive signal, the guard current level between the current electrodes A3 and A4 can be varied, thereby adjusting the lateral focussing of the shallow survey current Iosv The amplitude level of the A3 drive signal is set by the A3 controller 32 in accordance with a feedback signal from the voltage measurement electrodes M1 and M2.Ideally, there will be no potential difference between the voltage electrodes. A difference in potential gives an indication that a portion of the shallow survey current Ios is passing through the conductive drilling mud 16, thus the resistivity measurement would not be solely a measurement of the shallow formation resistivity, but rather would be weighted by the resistivity of the conductive drilling mud 16. The primary winding of a transformer 38 is connected across the voltage electrodes M1 and M2 to provide an indication of the potential difference between the electrodes to the voltage amplifier 40, which generates an error voltage signal. The error voltage output signal will be a periodic signal due to the alternating polarities of the measurement electrodes caused by the AC survey current Ions. A band.pass filter 42 has a pass band centered at the shallow survey current frequency FS in order to filter out any deep mode frequency component of the signal from the amplifier 40. A phase sensitive detector 44 converts the sinusoidal shallow error signal from the band pass filter 42 to a rectified sine wave, which is then filtered by a low pass filter 46.The DC error signal from the low pass filter 46 is fed to the A3 controller 32, and is integrated to establish the operating level of the power amplifier 34. If undesired survey current is passing through the drilling mud 16 of the borehole 2, the feedback signal from the measurement electrodes M1 and M2 causes the A3 controller 32 to increase the amplitude of the drive signal and, thus, the operating level of the power amplifier 34 in order to increase the level of the guard current Igs and force the survey current Ios deeper into the formation. If there is no difference in potential between the electrodes M1 and M2 then the operating level of the power amplifier 34 is allowed to remain at its present level. A second feedback loop is used in the bottom portion of the electrode array in order to adjust the output signal from the A3 controller 48 to establish the proper operating level of the power amplifier 50 which establishes a potential difference across the primary winding of the transformer 52 to drive the lower shallow guard current 1gas The measurement electrodes M1 and M2 , transformer 54, voltage amplifier 56, band pass filter 58, phase sensitive detector 60, and low pass filter 62 provide aDC error signal to the A3 controller 48. Since the operation of the lower feedback loop is identical to that of the upper feedback loop, a detailed description of the operation is not necessary. Stabilization in the control loops is improved by using a downhole phase sensitive detector in the feedback loop from theM electrodes to the power amplifiers. The phase sensitive detectors provide measurements of the resistive portion of the formation while rejecting induced voltage in the bridle or tool wiring. Due to the separate feedback loops, the A3 controller 32 and the A3 controller 48 act independently of each other. Thus, the guard currents Igs and 1gas1 can be separately controlled to permit greater flexibility in focussing the survey current 1os. This is particularly important, for example, when the resistivity of the formation substrate adjacent one portion of the logging tool has a resistivity significantly different than the resis tivity of the substrate adjacent another portion of the logging tool. By providing the upper and lower portions of the electrode array with independently operated controllers, the well logging tool of the present invention has improved depth resolution of resistivity measurements in the earth. The measurement electrodes M1 and M2 also provide an indication of the potential induced in the formation by the survey current for use in measuring the resistivity of the formation. The potential at the center tap of the primary winding of transformer 38 is supplied to the differential amplifier 66. Due to the use of the center tap voltage, the signal to the differential amplifier 66 will be the average voltage level of the electrodes M1 and M2 when the electrodes are not at equal potential. Of course, if the potential level is the same at each of the electrodes M1 and M2, the voltage at the center tap will be at that level. The differential amplifier 66 measures the center tap voltage with respect to the remote potential reference level from the fish electrode 22. The output of the differential amplifier 66 is passed through a band pass filter 68 to filter out the signal components not related to the shallow survey current. A phase sensitive detector 70 and low pass filter 72 convert the shallow frequency voltage signal from the band pass filter 68 into a filtered DC value VOS for transmission to the surface equipment 21 Fig. 1 by telemetry circuits. The Vos signal is also used by the Ao controller as one variable used in setting the operating level of the power amplifier 26 and, thereby, the amplitude of the shallow survey current Ios. The current emitted from the Ao electrode through the borehole and earth formation to the respective current returns is a composite current containing both the deep and shallow frequency components. This composite current is measured by a current transformer 74 and amplified by an amplifier 76. A band pass filter 78 separates the shallow frequency current signal from the composite frequency signal. A phase sensitive detector 80 converts the shallow frequency current to a rectified sine wave, which is filtered by a low pass filter 82. This filtered signal Ios is sent to telemetry circuits for transmission to the surface equipment 21 and to the Ao controller as an input used in setting the output level of the power amplifier 26 at the shallow mode survey current frequency Fs. The surface equipment 21 uses the ratio of the VOS voltage signal from the measurement electrodes relative to theIos current signal to give an indication of the resistivity of the shallow portion of the formation. Figure 4 schematically illustrates the deep mode survey current drive circuitry. As shown, the outputs from the A0 controller 24, A3 controller 32, and A3 controller 48 are connected to the electrode array in the same manner as in the shallow mode. Thus, the same current driving equipment can be used for both modes. However, the feedback loops used in the deep mode for controlling the deep mode frequency output of the controllers 24, 32 and 48 are slightly different than the shallow mode feedback loops, but operate on the same general principle. As well as outputting a drive signal at the frequency FS for use in the shallow mode, the Ao controller 24, A3 controller 32 and A3 controller 48 output a second drive signal at a frequency FD to synchronously drive the current electrodes Ao, A3 and A311 respectively. As discussed with reference to operation in the shallow mode, synchronization between the drive currents can be obtained by using a common oscillator for all of the controllers or by electronically controlling the operation of separate oscillators. An A4 controller 84 operates through the power amplifier 86 and transformer 88 to drive the electrode A4 with respect to the remote current return electrode 18.An A41 controller 90 operates through a power amplifier 92 and transformer 94 to drive the current electrode A41 with respect to the remote current return electrode 18. The A4 controller 84 and A41 controller 90 force the current electrodes A4 and A4 , respectively, to emit guard currents Igd4 and 1god4 which are synchronous with the guard currents from the A3 and A3 electrodes and the survey current from the Ao electrode. The feedback loop for controlling the A3 controller 32 deep mode drive signal output includes a transformer 96 having its primary winding connected across upper measurement electrodesM1 and M3. Any difference in potential between the measurement electrodes M1 and M3 is amplified by the amplifier 98. The low pass filter 100 passes only the signals at the deep mode survey current frequency FD, and the deep mode error signal output of the low pass filter 100 is converted to a rectified sine wave by the phase sensitive detector 102 and filtered by low pass filter 104. The filtered output from the low pass filter 104 is input to the A3 controller 32 to adjust the amplitude of the deep mode drive signal. The deep mode feedback loop for controlling the A31 controller 48 operates on the identical principles as the A3 controller feedback loop. Transformer 106 measures the potential difference between the lower measurement electrodes M1 and M3r. Amplifier 108, low pass filter 110, phase sensitive detector 112 and low pass filter 114 then provide an input to theA31 controller 48 to control the deep mode operating level of the power amplifier 50. The A4 controller 84 is also provided with a feedback loop comprising transformer 116, low pass filter 120, phasesensitive detector 122 and low pass filter 124. The primary winding of the transformer 116 is connected between the A4 current electrode and the A measurement electrode to measure any potential differences between the electrodes. If the A electrode is at a higher potential than the A4 electrode, then current is passing up the borehole from the A3 electrode to theA4 electrode. Conversely, if the potential of the A4 electrode is higher than that of the A electrode, current is passing down the borehole from the current electrode A4 to the current electrode A3. These borehole currents have an adverse effect on the focussing of the deep mode survey current. The low pass filter 120 filters out any signals at the shallow mode frequency and passes only those signals measured by the transformer 116 at the deep mode frequency FD. In an alternative embodiment, the low pass filter 120 could be replaced with a band pass filter designed to have a pass band centered at the appropriate low frequency corresponding to FD. The deep mode error signal from the low pass filter 120 then passes through the phase sensitive detector 122 and low pass filter 124 to provide the A4 controller 84 with an input used in controlling the operating level of the power amplifier 86. If, during the positive polarity portion of the drive signal, the potential at the A4 electrode is higher than the potential at the A electrode, then the operating level of the A4 controller 84 is lowered to reduce the current output from the A4 electrode.If the current emitted by the A4 electrode is too low, that is if the potential at theA4 electrode is lower than that of the A electrode, the amplitude of the current drive signal from the A4 controller 84 is increased to raise the deep mode frequency current output from the A4 electrode. An identical feedback loop comprising a transformer 126, amplifier 28, low pass filter 130, phase sensitive detector 132, and low pass filter 134 is used to control the amplitude of the deep mode current drive signal supplied by the A41 controller 90 to the power amplifier 92. The primary winding of the transformer 126 is connected across the A and A41 electrodes, which directly correspond to the A and A4 electrodes in the upper portion of the electrode array, to detect any borehole currents at the deep mode frequency passing between the A31 and A4 electrodes The feedback loop operates in the same manner as the A4 feedback loop to adjust the current output of the A41 electrode in order to eliminate the borehole currents. The surface equipment 21 evaluates the signals VOD and IOD to produce a log corresponding to the deep resistivity measurements. The VOD signal is obtained in the same manner as the VO5 signal in the shallow mode. As in the shallow mode, the differential amplifier 66 measures the center tap voltage from the primary winding of the transformer 38 with respect to the remote potential reference level from the fish electrode 22. Low pass filter 136 filters out the signals which have a higher frequency than the deep mode survey current FD. The deep mode frequency voltage signal is then converted into a filtered DC value VOD by the phase sensitive detector 138 and low pass filter 140. The composite current measured by the current transformer 74 and amplified by the amplifier 76 is input into the low pass filter 142, which filters out those portions of the signal that do not relate to the deep mode drive current. A phasesensitive detector 144 converts the deep frequency current to a rectified sine wave, which is filtered by a low pass filter 82 to produce the deep mode drive current signal IoD. Due to the provision of four separate feedback loops for individually controlling the deep mode current outputs of the different current electrodes, proper focussing of the survey currents is maintained even when the logging tool is located near a boundary between different earth formations. That is, even when the electrode array is intersected by a boundary layer, the upper and lower current electrodes arecontrolled independently in order to provide focussing adapted to the local formation properties. Another advantage of the improved focussing is that additional downhole tools or equipment can be mounted above the resistivity measuring device. Although these additional tools may be conductive, little effect is seen on resistivity measurements due to the maintenance of focussing and remoteness achieved by the present invention. Various modifications to the preferred embodiment could be made by one of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the inventive concepts contained in the present inventionFor example, the M1 M2 measurement electrode pair could be used in the feedback control loops for the deep mode as well as the shallow mode. Alternatively, the M1 M3 measurement pair utilized in the deep mode could also be used in the shallow mode feedback loops. Also, the measurement of VOS and or Vod could be made by averaging voltage measurements on both the upper and lower measurement electrodes. The principles, preferred embodiments and modes of operation of the present invention have been described in the foregoing specification. The invention which is intended to be protected herein, however, is not to be construed as being limited to the particular forms disclosed, since these are to be regarded as illustrative rather than restrictive. Variations and changes may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the invention.
