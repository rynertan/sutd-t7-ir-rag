# Multi chopping drive circuit for an electromagnetic print hammer or the like.

## Abstract
A constant energy drive circuit comprises two intercon nected chopping circuits 19, 21 24 and 26 30 successively operable to control the current in a coil 10 of an electro magnetic actuator. One chopping circuit 19, 21 24 operates during the rise time portion of the operating interval, the other 26 30 operates beginning with the occurrence of a predetermined peak current and for remainder of the operating interval of fixed duration.
