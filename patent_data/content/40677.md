# A method and apparatus for shaping optical pulses.

## Abstract
An optical pulse shaping apparatus and method of shaping optical pulses involves the use of a phase coherent multi frequency light beam 13 with an optical element 14 consisting of a sample containing an absorption band with multiple holes. The holes are burned into the sample to selected depths at selected frequency locations, thereby permitting the relative phases and amplitudes of the input frequency components of the beam 13 to be indepen dently varied to arbitrary values. This apparatus provides arbitrary transfer functions for generalized Fourier syn thesis of optical pulses.
