## Description
Title Prophylactic Susbstance or Composition THIS INVENTION relates to substances and compositions containing such substances for use in the prophylaxis of cancerous conditions. In 1980 Horrobin The Reversibility of Cancer The Relevonce ofCyclic AMP, Calcium, Essential Fatty Acids and Prostaglandin E1 Med.Hypotheses 1980, Vol. 6, pages 469 to 486 dealt extensively with metabolic abnormalities common to almost all cancer cells, and also discussed possible causative factors for these. Horrobin concludes that a metabolic abnormality in the synthesis of the prostaglandins thromboxane A2 TXA2 and prostaglandin E1 PrGE1 is the final factor which allows an initiated cancer cell to express its abnormality, that is to divide ad infinitum.Horrobin further proposed on the basis of evidence present in the general literature that the defect which leads to the abnormality in the synthesis ofTXA2 and PGEI is an inhibition of the enzyme delta 6 desaturase. This enzyme converts the essential fatty acid linoleic acid LA , to gamma linolenic acid GLA in all normal cells of the body. GLA is further metabolised to dihomo gamma linolenic acid DGLA which in turn is converted to prostaglandins of the I series, which includes PGE1. PGE I and TXA2 are potent intracellular regulators of the biochemistry of all normal cells. TXA2 however cannot function in the absence of PGEI. Horrobin surmised that a deficiency of PGEI and thus disabled TXA2, will cause an abnormal metabolism of the cell, of sufficient magnitude to trigger off uncontrolled division of potential cancer cells. Horrobin thus proposed that inter alia a GLA supplement should be given to. cancer patients receiving conventional treatment, in order to test his hypothesis, namely, that in bypassing the metabolic block caused by an inhibited delta 6 desaturase d 6 d activity, it should be possible to normalise cancer cells by reverse transformation. In Europeon Patent Publication No. 0 037 Horrobin discloses a mixture of GLA and thioproline for the treatment of cancer. According to one aspect of the invention there is provided a prophylactic method for the prevention of the multiplication of viable cancer cells includes the step of administering, on a regular basis, to a human or animal, a prophylactic amount of one or more precursors for the production in vivo, of one or more of the following eicosanoid mixtures, namely a b c PGE1 PGE2 PGE3 PGF1 PGF2 PGF3TXA1 PGD2 PGD3 Prostacyclin 17Prostacyclin TXA2 TXA3LTA3 LTA4 LTA5 LTC3 LTB4 LTB5 LTD3 LTC4 LTD4 LTE4 according to the following scheme EMI3.1 tb SEP E1 SEP ongase SEP h5Desaturase tb SEP Cr8 3,Ç6 SEP SEP C20 3,a 6 SEP A5Desaturase tb SEP 20 3, tb SEP y I inolenlc SEP Dihomo y SEP Arachidonic tb SEP 1 SEP inolenic SEP 1 tb SEP 1 tb SEP PGE1 SEP PGE1 SEP rGE2 tb SEP PGF1 SEP .

According to another aspect of this invention there is provided a prophylactic composition for the prevention or minimisation of multiplication of viable cancer cells or for bypassing the effects of a delta6 desaturase deficiency comprising one or more precursors for the production in vivo of one or more of the following eicosanoid mixtures, namely a b c PGE1 PGE2 PGE3PGF1 PGF2 PGF3TXA1 PGD2 PGD3 Prostacyclin 17Prostacyclin TXA2 TXA3LTA3 LTA4 LTA5LTC3 LTB4 LTB5LTD3 LTC4LTD4 LTE4 According to a further aspect of this invention there is provided a prophylactic composition comprising gamma linolenic acid GLA anachidonic acid AA and or eicosapentaenoic acid EPA , or salts, derivatives or analogues thereof. The present invention is concerned mainly with the prophylactic use of the substances for cancer and does not include the treatment of an already manifest pathological cancer. Generally speaking, the conventional cancer treatments, even if they could be used prophylactically in small doses couse extreme discomfort and distress and could even precipitate other cancerous conditions. As opposed to the hypotheses of Horrobin tht GLA merely restores me ratio between PGE1 and TXA2 in malignant cells, it has now been found iiiat the proliferation suppressive effect of GLA and AA and EPA depends on their ability to give rise to the production of a number of eicosanoids and related compounds for example, PGAI and PGD1 have a much greater proliferation suppressive effect on human cancer cells than does PGE1 PGB has a lesser effect whereas yet other PGs derived from GLA, including PGFla and PGF2a have no effect at all on the proliferation of human cancer cells. In a preferred form of the invention GLA, and or AA and or EPA is administered as a dietary supplement. The composition may be presented in o number of possible forms such as, for example, capsules, pills, tablets or other conventional pharmaceutical forms, or in a mixture with foodstuffs, beverages and the like. The unit doses, in the form of capsules, pills, tablets or dietary supplements may be packaged in a single pock. The amount of active ingredient in such supplement or foodstuff or beverage should preferably be no more than for an average daily intake of up to 100mg thereof per 100kg body weight. The invention may also provide a method of bypassing the effects of a delta 6 desaturase deficiency in otherwise healthy individuals. The d 6 d may be stimulated by the inclusion of relatively large quantities of w 6 linolenic acid, or w 3 linolenic acid in the compositions of the invention. If will be appreciated that suitable salts, derivatives or chemical analgoues of the above substances are also in the scope of the present invention. In particular the magnesium and zinc salts are important. The substance or composition may be provided in unit dosage form, eg for daily or twice daily administration, such as in tablets or capsules. In each capsule the active ingredient may be in solution, or it may be in the form of a tablet or particulate mixture, comprising the active ingredient together with a solid diluent or carrier. A unit dosage for daily administration typically for a person of 50 to 100 kg body weight, may contain up to 100 mg of active ingredient, which is 5 10 of the dose recommended for treatment of pathological cancer which is a difference in the order of magnitude. Such a daily unit dosage is not useful for the treatment of pathological cancerous conditions. The preferred dosage of this invention is also very much lower than that used for treatment of alcholism and other diseases. Suitable solvents for the active ingredients comprise plant oils, isotonic saline solutions or any other lipid or aqueous solvents suitable for human intake. The compositions of this invention may also contain VitaminA derivatives for protective effects against skin cancer Vitamin BComplex as co factors , Vitamin C with which there seems to be a synergistic effect , or Vitamin E which also serves as an anti oxidant . Zinc or mognesium salts may be added to the composition. The invention will now be described and illustrated by way of the following examples with reference to the accompanying drawings which are all graphical figures illustrating experimental results.EXAMPLE IExperimental ProcedureMaterialsGamma linolenic acid GLA The fatty acid GLA Sigma L 2378 was prepared for addition to a culture medium under anaerobic conditions by the method described by Ingerman Wojenski et al Prostaglandins 1981 21, 655 664 . The chemically pure fatty acid was dissolved in O,IM Na2CO3 to a concentration of 10 mg ml, under N2. This stock solution was stored at 800C. When required, this stock mixture was further diluted with 0. M Na2 CO3 to final fatty acid concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 10 ,ug mI. These final concentrations were added to the culture medium described hereunder, as required and after sterilisation by millipore filtration type GS, pore size 0.22rum . Cells Two cells lines were maintained in Greiner plastic flasks Labortechnik in McCoys 5A medium Flow Laboratories containing 10 fetal calf serum Flow Laboratories and antibiotics CRYSTAPEN, ie sodium benzyl penicillin, and NOVOSTREP . Stock cultures were re fed twice a week and subsultured at weekly intervals or sooner if required, ie when the culture became depleted. The two cell lines comprised BL6 mouse melanoma cells which were obtained from Dr. C. Albrecht, Department ofPharmacology, University of Stellenbosch, South Africa and MDBK bovine kidney cells which were obtained from Dr. D. Verwoerd, VeterinaryResearch Institute, Onderstepoort, South Africa.The Critical ExperimentGLA dose response curves Sixteen independent groups of dose response curves to GLA were evaluated by the following two standard procedures, ie i by determining the total cell count and viability n 6 , and ii by assessing cell proliferation by determining the rates of DNA and protein synthesis, and using the incorporation of radioactive thymidine, n 5 and methionine n 5 , respectively. All experiments were performed by the identical and simultaneous addition of the GLA to both cell lines, making a total of 32 separate experimental culture sets. Each of these 32 culture sets comprised two control cultures and a range of GLA containing cultures.The GLA dosages single dosage in each case for the cell count procedure were 0.5 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9, and 10 ug ml, respectively. Thus each culture set comprised 13 separate experiments. A total of 156 separate cultures were therefore used for the GLA growth rate determinations. TheGLA dosages for both the thymidine and methionine were two controls without GLA , and 2, 3, 6, 8 and 10 ,ug ml. Each set of dosages was duplicated for both cell lines. Thus, a total of 280 separate cultures were used for these determinations.For statistical treatment an average value of each duplicate was used as n i Growth Curves Protocol The cells were seeded in a standard growth medium McCoys 5A medium from stock cultures into Greiner 50 ml plastic flasks at subconfluent densities ranging from I x 105 cells flask. Following cell attachment after 6 to 24 hours, GLA was added to give the final concentrations described above. The control cultures were treated identically except for the omission of GLA. These cultures flasks were incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 5 CO2, 95 air at 370C for 7 days. After this period cell counts and viabilities were determined, the latter by trypan blue dye exclusion. ii Cell Prciliferation Protocol For the determination of DNA and protein synthesis 200 p of cell suspension 2.4 x 104 cells were added to each of 12 wells of a Dynatech Microtiter plate M 29 AR , followed, after cell attochment, by the GLA concentrations described above. Plates were incubated in a 5 CO2 humidified atmosphere at 370C. For the final 24 hours, of 06 3H thymidine or I vuCI of L 0methyl 3 g methionine New England Nuclear, Boston, Mass was added to each incubation mixture on the micrplate. The cells were then collected using a Skatron automatic harvester onto glass fibre reinforced resin filters. The filters were dried and dissolved in 10 ml Picofluor TM30 Packord . The 6 3HJ thymidine incorporation into DNA and the L methyl H methionine incorporation into proteins was counted on a Packard Tri Carb scintillation counter.Data Reduction and Statistical Analyses Using the values of cell counts obtained as described above, the difference of each cell count from its control was expressed as a perecentage of the control. As the growth curves were repeated several times for each dose for both normal and cancer cells, the mean value and standard error was determined for each dose. The statistical significance of the difference between the response of the BL6 and MDBK cells to GLA was determined using the paired Student ttest. For the purpose of presentation these percentage differences are expressed as the percentage reduction of growth rate GR . ResultsGLA Dose Response Curves i Growth Rates Figure I and Table I shows the percentage reduction of growth rates GR of BL6 and MDBK cells in response to increasing doses of GLA. A statistically highly significant percentage reduction in the growth rate of the BL6 cancer cells was found relative to the normal MDBK cells with every dose of GLA from 0.05 yglml p 0.01 to 10,ug ml p 0.001 .The dose response curve of the BL6 cancer cells showed a stepwise progression of the GR for GLA doses from 0.5lvg ml to about 7.0pug ml. At GLA doses above 7ug ml the growth response curve reaches a plateau at a GR of about 70 . This is suggestive of a saturable dose response curve.The response of the MDBK cells is remarkable as there is no apparent response to any of the GLA doses. ii Cell Proliferation The effect in increasing GLA doses on the uptake of radioactive thymidine and methionine by BL6 and MDBK is shown in Table II and in Figures 2 and 3. As expected, these responses are similar to the respective cell growth responses. A statistically highly significant reduction in the uptake of methionine and thymidine occurred in the malignant BL6 cells as compared to the normal MDBK cells. At a GLA dose level of 10 ug ml the reduction in methionine and thymidine uptake by BL6 cells amounted to 58.9 and 59.1 respectively.

This was achieved by adding 20 ul of GLA in sodium carbonate stock 10 mg ml directly to each GLA flask containing 10 ml of culture medium. To control flasks only 20 tJ of the sodium carbonate vehicle was added.Cells Cells of the human primary carcinoma of the liver line were provided by Dr. J.J. Alexander of the Division of Virology, Department ofMicrobiology, Medical University of South Africa. These cells were maintained in Grenier plastic flasks in McCoys SA medium as described inExample I.Growth Rate Protocol The cells were seeded in the standard growth medium from stock cultures into Greiner 50 ml plastic flasks at subconfluent densities ranging from 2 x 105 to 3 x 105 cells per flask. Following cell attachment after 6 hours, 20jjg ml of GLA in sodium carbonate was added to the GLA flasks while sodium carbonate only was added to the control flasks. These culture flasks were included in a humidified atmosphere of 5 CO2, 95 air at 370. At the end of each experiment the detached, dead cells were discarded with the culture medium. The living attached cells were trypsinised and then counted using a Coulter counter. Cell viability was checked by trypan blue dye exclusion. In addition, the culture flasks were viewed and photographed daily under a Nikon diaphot inverted phase microscope. To determine the effect df the duration of GLA treatment, two different procedures were adopted. i Daily Dose effect The culture medium was changed daily and new GLA was added every day. Cells were photographed and counted on day I, day 2, day 3, and day 4 run I n 4 for both GLA and controls on each day . The procedure for day 4 was repeated run 2 n 4 for both GLA and controls . ii Single dose effect One dose of GLA was added to the GLA flasks n 8 and one dose of sodium carbonate to the controls n 8 on day I of the experiment. The cells were counted after 4 days in culture. Results Daily Dose Effect Table Ill shows the effects of a daily dose of GLA on the growth rate of human hepatoma cells. The average reduction of the growth rate in the ULA flasks compared to the control flasks was 66 on day 2, 78 on day 3, and 87 on day 4 for run I and run 2 respectively. The mean values and standard error of mean for run one is shown in Figure 4. This shows the normal proliferation rate of the untreated control cells. There was a plating efficiency of about 35 and a doubling every two days, which has been reported to be typical for this hepatoma cell line. In contrast, there was a statistically highly significant reduction in the growth rate of the GLA treated cells when compared with the control cells.The following differences were noted after 3 days between the treated GLA cells and the control cells at magnifications of 100x and 200x. The control cells were uniformly distributed over the flask. In contrast, there were large areas with zero cell growth in the GLA treated flasks and the visualised cells were far fewer, less dense and differed markedly from both the controls. This was reported as typical for this cell line. Single Dose Effects After four days, the cell count, after a single dose of GLA on day I was 19.81 x 104 4.85 compared to 21.8 x IQ4 for the controls. There was no significant difference between the growth rates of GLA supplemented and control cells. The results of Examples I and 2 show that for both the mouse melanoma cells and the human cancer cells the in vitro supplementation of GLA produces a statistically significant reduction in the growth rate of the cancerous cells. Thus, by maintaining the level of GLA at a certain level the uncontrolled multiplication of potential cancer cells is prevented.

Alexander of theDepartment of Microbiology at Medunsa, South Africa. Control benign bovine kidney cells MDBK were from the same stock that were used in the previous examples.Techniques The techniques used for growing cells in culture, GLA supplementation of the growth media and for obtaining cell counts were similar to those reported in the previous examples.ResultsMG63 Osteoid sarcoma cells From Figure 5 it can be seen that GLA supplementation of the culture media of MG63 cells caused a marked, statistically highly significant growth suppressive effect of these cells compared with the growth of unsupplemented MG63 cells Table lav At the end of seven days in culture following daily GLA supplementation, the mean number of MG63 cells increased from the initial seeding density of 0.3 x 106 cells to 0.56 x 106. The mean number of untreated control MG63 cells increased from 0.3X 106 to 2.3 x 106 cells over the same period of time. This difference in growth rate represents a growth suppressive effect of 76 in the GLA supplemented MG63 cells over the seven days experimental period. The mean number of GLA supplemented control MDBK cells, in contrast to the MG63 cells, exceed the mean number of unsupplemented MDBK cells at the end of the seven day period. Oesophaqeal carcinoma cells Figure 6 shows the growth rate of oesophageal carcinoma cells following supplementation of their growth media with lûiug GLA per day for six days, compared to the growth of control cultures of unsupplemented oesophageal carcinoma cells. The mean number of unsupplemented cells increased from the initial seeding number of 0.14 x 106 to 6.62 x 106 at the end of eight days in culture Table IV . In contrast, the mean number of GLA supplemented cells increased from 0.14 x 106 to only 2.04 x 106 cells over the same period of time. This growth suppressive effect of 69 at the end of the eight day period was found to be statistically highly significant.A stotistically significant growth suppressive effect by GLA of the oesophageal carcinoma cells became evident from the sixth day in culture Table IV .EXAMPLE 4Experimental ProcedureMaterialsGLA GLA Sigma 2378 was dissolved in sodium carbonate under N2 as described in Examples I and 2. A GLA dose of 20 u I of the sodium carbonate stock contains the GLA was added directly to each flask containing 10 ml of the later described culture medium. Only 20yu 1 of the sodium carbonate vehicle was added to control flasks. Cells. Malignant BL6 mouse melanoma cells were maintained in Griener plastic flasks Labortechnik containing 10 fetal calf serum FlorLaboratories and antibiotics. Stock cultures were refed twice weekly and were subcultured at. weekly intervals or sooner if required. The BL6 mouse melanoma cells were supplied by Dr. C. Albrecht, Department ofPharmacology, University of Stellenbosch, South Africa.Procedure BL6 melanoma cells were seeded in the standard growth medium from stock cultures into 50 ml Greiner plastic flasks to give subconfluent densities of 500, 1,000 and 2,000 cells flasks. Duplicates were set up for the three densities. Following cell attachment after 24 hours, GLA was added to the growth media in the flasks to give the final concentration of 20 yg ml. Growth media were replaced daily and GLA was added daily for two weeks. Control cultures were treated identically except for the omission ofGLA. The culture flasks were incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 5 CO2, 95 air at 37 0C. At the end of the two weeks period the culture flasks were stained using a 0.1 Amidoschwarz stain solution.Results At the end of the two weeks the initially seeded melanoma cells had established colonies of various sizes in the control culture flasks. The densest concentration of colonies were formed in the flasks in which 2,000 cells were seeded. In contrast, not a single colony could be observed after two weeks in the GLA treated culture flasks, in either the 500, 1,000 or 2,000 cells seeded flasks. The growth and proliferation of the malignantBL6 melanoma cells was therefore completely suppressed by GLA supplementation. The results of this experiment are clear cut and two facts become evident from the results Firstly, they confirm that the malignancy in this particular cell type is GLA deficiency dependent. Secondly, the growth of such malignant cells can be completely suppressed by the presence of GLA.

Linoleic acid supplemented cultures achieved about 75 of the growth of control cultures. Oleic acid supplemented cultures achieved about the same growth as control cultures. PGEI and PGA I cultures achieved about 25 of the growth of control cultures. PGF cultures achieved about the same growth as the control cultures. GLA and AA supplemented cultures were completely devoid of any colonies in 500, 1,000 and 2,000 cell density cultures. The results show that oleic acid has no suppressive effect on cancer cells and that the prostaglandin precursor fatty acid linoleic acid had some growth suppressive effect on the cancer cells in culture because of its stimulative effect on d 6 d . PGEI and PGAI, had a more pronounced growth suppressive effect whilst PGF1a had no effect at all on cancer cell growth. In contrcst, GLA AA, the intermediates between the precursor fatty acids and the prostaglandins had a complete growth suppressive effect. The results would suggest that uncontrolled cell division in cancer cells could be the result of abnormalities in the concentration of some of the prostaglandins in such cells, resulting from a block in their synthesis from precursor fatty acids. Such abnormalities are evidently eliminated by supplying the cancer cells with GLA or AA, the substrate from which the required prostaglandins can be synthesized in their required concentrations. Once this can be achieved by cancer cells, their uncontrolled division is apparently totally checked.EXAMPLE 6 Zn view of the surprising observation reported in Example 5, that arachidonic acid AA supplementation at a rate of 40vu1 ml medium of mg63 osteogenic sarcoma cells completely suppresses proliferation and colony formation of the cells in culture, this experiment was repeated in order to confirm the observation. In addition, the effect of cancer cell supplementation with eicosapentaenoic acid SPA the essential fatty acid intermediate prostaglandin precursor of the 3 series prostoglandins, prostacyclin, thromboxane A3 and leukotrienes, was also investigated.EPA is derived from the naturally occurring essential fatty acid A linolenic acid C 18 3 W3 by the action of d 6 d to give octadecatetraenoic acid C 18 4W3 , which undergoes chain elongation to eicosatetraenoic acid C20 4 W3 , which in turn gives rise to eicosatetraenoic acid following the action of delta 5 c1esaturase. PROCEDURE MG63 Human osteogenic sarcoma cells were seeded in culture flasks as described in Examples 4 and 5. 2,000 cells were seeded in each flask.Duplicate sets of flasks were used for each of the fatty acids tested. The following fatty acids dissolved in standard growth medium were added to the cells in culture, after allowing 2 days for cell attachment, and again after a further 3 days. Each culture therefore had only 2 additions of the relevant fatty acid. The cells were stained and examined at the end of 7 days in culture 1. Culture medium only control.2. 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 jug oleic acid respectively ml culture medium. Oleic acid OA is an 18C fatty acid with one unsaturated bond in the omega 9 position. It is therefore structurally nearly identical to either linoleic acid LA and a linolenic acid ALA with the singular exception of the number of double bonds contained in the molecule. On account of the latter differences, OA, unlike LA and ALA cannot give rise to eicosanoids PG S, LT.S, TXA S and prostacyclin . It is therefore considered to be an excellent fatty acid to use as a control when investigating the effects of the eicosanoids .3. 5 10, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100tug LA respectively ml culture medium.4. 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 vug ALA respectively ml culture medium. 5. 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 g ml AA respectively ml culture medium. 6. 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 g ml EPA respectively ml culture medium. 7. 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100Sug ml GLA respectively ml culture medium. RESULTS I. OA supplemented cells achieved equal densities of colonies for all levels of supplementation between 5 and 100 pg ml, and as did the controls with culture medium only. 2. LA and ALA had a definite proliferation suppressive action at the higher levels of supplementation, that is at 80 and 100prg ml. 3. EPA, AA and GLA exhibited an almost equal, progressive, suppressive action on the proliferation and colony formation of the MG63 osteogenic carcoma cells. 4. EPA, AA and GLA completely suppressed cell growth and colony formotion at levels of supplementation above 40 g ml culture medium. Not a single cell or colony of cells could be found on microscopic examination of the cultures which had been supplemented with either EPA, AA or GLA respectively at supplementation levels between 40 and lODyg mI. It would therefore appear that the three precursor fatty acid intermediates, GLA, AA and EPA, which each gives rise to a separate family of eicosanoids, have the ability to individually arrest and suppress cancer cell growth. It would further appear that any one of these eicosanoid precursor fatty acids separately or in combination could be used prophylactically against cancer. The features disclosed in the foregoing description, in the following claims and or in the accompanying drawings may, both separately and in combination thereof, the material for realising the invention in diverse forms thereof.
