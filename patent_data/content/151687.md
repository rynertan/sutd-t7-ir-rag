# Process for the isolation of 5 Allyl 2 3,4 dimethoxyphenyl 3a methoxy 3 methyl 2,3,3a,6 tetrahydro 6 oxobenzofuran and pharmaceutical composition for treating inflammatory conditions.

## Abstract
5 allyl 2 3,4 dimethoxyphenyl 3α methoxy 3 methyl 2,3,3α,6 tetrahydro 6 oxabenzofuran and analogs thereof as PAF antagonists have been isolated from Piper Futokadsura Sieb. et Zucc. and its analogs prepared. These neolignan compounds are found to have potent and specific PAF Platelet Activating Factor antagonistic activities and are thereby useful in the treatment of various diseases or disorders mediated by the PAF, for example, inflammation, cardiovascular disorder, asthma, lung edema, and adult respiratory distress syndrome.
