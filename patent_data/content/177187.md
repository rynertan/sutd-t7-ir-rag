A method of casting slabs and rolling metal strip and or sheet in line comprising the steps of continuously casting a slab to a thickness capable of being coiled characterised by coiling said slab 9 in a coiler furnace 17A,17B prior to reducing the slab to strip thickness, and then reducing said slab to strip thickness.

## Description
There has been a trend in recent years to establish so called mini mills or mini midi mills . These are mills that typically produce 100,000 to 1,000,000 U.S. tons 90,720 to 907,200 tonnes of steel per year as specialised products. These mills have been integrated with continuous casters for casting small billets, bars, and rods. However, the integration of casters and mini mills has not extended to the reduction of slabs to strip thicknesses because of the large capital investment required for floor space and rolling equipment. This invention relates to an integrated process for the casting and rolling of slabs to form strip and or sheet. It has particular application to the small steel mill where space is limited. In this process, rolling may take place in a reversing mill rather than a continuous or semi continuous hot strip mill. It involves the use of continuously cast thin slabs, say of the order of 1.5 inches 3.8cm thick or less. Heretofore, continuous casting has been considered primarily for casting of thick slabs, say 8 inches 20.3cm thick, which slabs must be processed through rolling mills including reheat furnaces, roughing and finishing trains. In one aspect, this invention relates to a unique application of coiler furnaces. The uses of coiler furnaces have been described, for example, in U.S. Patent Specifications Nos. 2,658,741 4,384,468 4,430,870 and British Patent Specifications Nos. 918,005 and 652,772. In yet another aspect, this invention relates to the processing of continuously cast slabs, e.g. those that are as thin, say 1.5 inches 3.8cm or less, as can in practice be coiled. It has been reported that increasingly thinner sections have been cast with present capability limited to about 1 inch 2.54cm thickness, According to the present invention, there is provided a method of casting slabs and rolling metal strip and or sheet in line comprising the steps of continuously casting a slab to a thickness capable of being coiled characterised by coiling said slab in a coiler furnace prior to reducing the slab to strip thickness and then reducing said slab to strip thickness. Preferably the method comprises alternately coiling slabs in first and second coiler furnaces downstream of a continuous caster and upstream of a rolling mill, and rolling slabs on said rolling mill to strip by paying off a slab from one of said coiler furnaces while taking up a next slab on the other of said coiler furnaces. The coiler furnaces are preferably positioned in vertical alignment on either side of a pass line. Preferably the step of rolling the slab to strip comprises passing the slab back and forth through a reversing mill between one of said first and second coiler furnaces and another coiler furnace downstream of said reversing mill. The slab is preferably cast to a thickness not more than 4 cm, while the metal is preferably steel. The slab may be passed directly through an equalizing furnace upstream of the first and second coiler furnaces. The invention also comprises apparatus for casting and rolling a metal strip and or sheet comprising casting means for continuously casting slabs having a thickness capable of being coiled characterised by at least one coiler furnace downstream of said casting means for receiving slabs delivered from the latter, and rolling means downstream of the said at least one coiler furnace for rolling slabs to strip by receiving slabs payed off from said at least one coiler furnace. There may be two coiler furnaces for alternately receiving slabs and for alternately paying off slabs to said rolling means. There may be furnace means in line with the casting means for equalizing the temperature of the slabs. The rolling means preferably comprises a reversing mill such that a slab may be passed back and forth through the reversing mill paying off one of said two coiler furnaces and being taken up by a coiler furnace downstream of the reversing mill. The processing rate capability of the rolling means may be slightly greater than the processing rate capability of the casting means. In its preferred form, the method comprises a first step of continuously casting a slab to a thickness capable of being coiled, say 1.5 inches 3.8cm or less. A second step comprises equalizing the temperature of the continuously cast slab prior to reduction. A third step comprises alternately coiling slabs in a first coiler furnace or a second coiler furnace, each of which is positioned upstream of a rolling mill. A fourth step comprises rolling the slab to strip, for example, by passing it back and forth through a reversing mill between one of the upstream coiler furnaces and a coiler furnace downstream of the reversing mill. A final step comprises recovering coiled strip. According to a preferred method, the two upstream coiler furnaces are in vertical alignment and while strip is being rolled by passing back and forth between the first coiler furnace upstream of the reversing mill and the downstream coiler furnace, a continuously cast slab is being taken up on the second coiler furnace upstream of the reversing mill. According to another preferred embodiment, a step is provided for passing the strip, which has been hot rolled to the desired gauge, over a roll out table where cooling jets bear upon it and then passing the strip to a final coiler. The preferred form of the apparatus according to this invention comprises an apparatus for melting steel and a caster for continuous casting of slabs having a thickness capable of being coiled, say of the order of 1.5 inches 3.8cm or less. The plant may include a furnace for receiving the cast slabs directly from the caster to reduce the difference in temperature from the interior to the faces of the slabs. The plant comprises two coiler furnaces preferably vertically aligned downstream of said caster and furnace, if present and upstream of a rolling mill for alternately receiving and coiling slab delivered from said furnace and finally the plant comprises a rolling mill to roll slabs to strip by receiving slabs first from one and then from the other coiler furnace. According to a preferred embodiment, the plant comprises a reversing mill and a downstream coiler furnace so that slabs can be passed back and forth through the reversing mill from one coiler furnace to another. The invention is illustrated, merely by way of example, in the accompanying drawing, which is a schematic drawing of a plant according to the present invention for continuously casting and rolling slabs to strip. Referring to the drawing, hot steel is transferred from a furnace, for example, an electric furnace not shown by a transfer ladle 10 to a tundish 11 of a continuous casting apparatus, constituted by a caster 13. The steel solidifies into a continuous slab 9 as it passes through a water cooled curved mould 14. As the steel slab 9 passes through the mould 14, the direction of movement of the slab is changed from vertical to horizontal, although horizontal casters are known and can also be employed. The mould 14 is sized so that the slabs emerging from the mould have a thickness of about 1.5 inches 3.8cm or less and a width of up to 72 inches 182.9cm . The specific slab 9 referred to hereinafter is 1.5 inches x 50 inches x 157 feet long 3.8cm x 1.27m x 47.85m . The slab 9 is cut to length by means of a slab cutting torch 15 when it reaches the desired length. The continuous slab 9 emerges at an approximate rate of 12 feet 3.66m per minute approximately 90 U.S. tons or 81.65 tonnes per hour . The details of the continuous slab caster are known and form no part of this invention. The continuous slab 9 immediately passes into an equalizing furnace 16 which is provided for the purpose of reducing the temperature difference between the interior and the faces of the slabs, i.e. homogenizing the slab temperature. The furnace 16 illustrated as a tunnel furnace adds little heat to the slab 9 but allows equalization of temperature throughout the slab. The temperature of the slab 9 emerging from the furnace 16 is approximately 1900 F 1037.8 C . The slab 9 is then taken up by one of two vertical coiler furnaces 17A and 17B. Each coiler furnace 17A,17B is capable of receiving material from the caster 13 and paying off in the opposite direction. A guide table 18 directs the slab 9 to one or the other of these coiler furnaces. Preferably, the coiler furnaces 17A,17B are vertically arranged one above the other, above and below the elevation at which the slab 9 emerges from the furnace 16. The coiler furnaces 17A,17B generally include burners not shown to maintain the appropriate temperature. This temperature is required both for that of the slab 9 and subsequent workpiece being coiled and decoiled and for the coiler mandrel not shown which must be at a temperature near that of the incoming steel to prevent thermal shock. The details of the construction of the coiler furnaces 17A,17B are known and form no part of this invention. A four high hot reversing mill 19 is arranged downstream of the coiler furnaces 17A,17B for receiving the slab from either such furnace. Beyond the reversing mill 19 is a downstream coiler furnace 20. The distance between the mill 19 and the coiler furnaces 17A,17B and 20 on each side thereof is approximately 23 feet 7.01m . Following downstream coiler furnace 20 is a roll out table 22 over which nozzles 23 are positioned for spraying cooling fluid upon the strip to lower its temperature to the desired coiling temperature. Downcoiler s 24 receive the finished strip, although shears may be alternatively employed where a sheet product rather than a hot strip band is required. The vertical coiler furnaces 17A,17B allow the rolling operation to be synchronized with the casting operation. Since the slab thickness is small in comparison with standard slabs, the productivity in terms of tonnes hr is also small. For this reason a single hot reversing mill 19 can presently handle the projected tonnage. It will be recognized that additional rolling stands can be employed upstream and or downstream of the down stream coiler furnace 20 depending on the tonnage capability of the caster 13 or the finished product needs, e.g. an additional stand for a particular roll surface. The coiler furnaces 17A,17B,20 also maintain the necessary heat so that an acceptable temperature drop is maintained during the various passes. While one vertical coiler furnace 17A,17B is receiving the slab from the caster 13, the other verical coiler furnace 17A,17B is working in conjunction with the reversing mill 19 and the downstream coiler furnace 20 to reduce the strip in back and forth passes between the coiler furnace 17A,17B,20 and through the reversing mill 19. A computer simulation of a seven pass cycle on a single hot reversing mill for reducing a low carbon steel slab 1.5 inches x 50 inches x 157 feet 3.8cm x 1.27m x 47.85m to a 20 ton 18.14 tonne coil 800 PIW 0.1 inch 2.54 mm thick may be summarized in the following Table The 494 seconds for rolling compare favourably with the time to coil the slab, namely 785 seconds at 12 feet 3.66m per minute. An equalizing furnace and its function may be replaced by the coiler furnaces. In other words, the temperature equalization may be achieved without the need for a separate furnace installation such as the tunnel furnace 16 illustrated.
