# Tanks for transporting liquids.

## Abstract
A transportable tank 1 for liquids is mounted in a supporting frame 4,5 . The tank 1 is covered with a detachable insulating jacket which is formed in section 9 comprising a layer of insulating material 13 enclosed within inner and outer skins 11, 12 of weather resistant fabric. The inner skin 11 is faced with aluminium foil to provide sacrificial protection to the tank. The sections 9 are secured by elastic lacing 14 which is itself protected from sunlight by flaps 19 carried by the sections. The insulating jacket can thus be removed for inspection of the tank walls 2, 3 or for repair or for installation on another similar tank.
