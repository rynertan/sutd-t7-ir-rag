## Description
PHOTORESIST COMPOSITION This invention relates to a photoresist composition. More specifically, this invention relates to a photoresist composition that gives a photoresist pattern having an improved adhesion to its substrate. In recent years, with a marked advance in the technology of producing integrated circuits of semi conductors such as the IC and LSI circuits, there is a strong demand that improvements be made in not only the production techniques but also the apparatuses and fringe or related materials used in their production. In the photoresist art also, there is a demand for photoresist compositions having superior manageability as well as a high resolving power. That which is presently used in the art as a negative type photoresist composition is one consisting of a cyclized product of a conjugated diene polymer and a diazide.Recently, with the photoresist patterns becoming finer and an increase in the etching speed, there is an increasing demand that the photoresist composition be one in which the photoresist patterns formed therefrom have espe ciaily good adhesion to the substrate. Numerous attempts have been made heretofore for improving the adhesion of the photoresist patterns formed on substrates such as of metals, metal oxides or other compounds. For example, there is disclosed in Japanese Patent PublicationNo. 25,915 1972 a method of improving the adhesion between the substrate and the photoresist pattern by using a specific compound and treating the surface of the substrate with this compound prior to the application of the photoresist composition, i.e., by activating the substrate surface. A method such as described is however intended for use with a surface of a specific substrate and cannot be applied universally to the usual substrates. Again, there is the need for a step for treating the substrate surface prior to coating the photoresist composition, thus making the process for producing the LSI circuits complicated.There is hence required a simpler and economical means of improving the adhesion of the photoresist pattern to the substrate. An object of this invention is to provide a new means by which the aforesaid requirements can be satisfied. The present inventors found that the aforesaid object can be achieved by using a photoresist composition containing a silylating agent. There is thus provided in accordance with the present invention a photoresist composition that consists essentially of a conjugated diene polymer or its cyclized product, an organic solvent, a photocross linking agent and a silylating agent. The silylating agent used in this invention is imposed no particular restriction so long as it is one having compatibility with the other components of the photoresist composition of this invention.Typical examples of the silylating agent are those compounds having the general formulaEMI1.1 wherein R, is an alkyl group or substituted alkyl group of 1 to 5 carbon atoms, R2, R3 and R4 are each an alkyl group or substituted alkyl group of 1 to 7 carbon atoms, and n is an integer from 1 to 2 the compounds of the general formulaEMI1.2 wherein Rsl R6, R, Rw, R, and R, are each an alkyl group or a substituted alkyl group of 1 to 7 carbon atoms the compounds of the general formulaEMI2.1 wherein R,,, R12, R,3, R,., R,s and R,รณ are each an alkyl group or a substitued alkyl group of 1 to 7 carbon atoms and the compounds of the general formulaEMI2.2 wherein R,7, R,., R,g and R20 are each an alkyl group or a substituted alkyl group of 1 to 7 carbon atoms. Of these compounds the compounds of the general formula i or general formula II are preferably used. The compounds of general formula I include, for example, such compounds as N trimethylsilylacetamide, N triethylsilylacetamide, N tripropylsilylacetamide, N,N bis trimethylsilyl acetamide, N ,N bis trimethylsilyl trifluoroacetamide and N,Nbis triethylsilyl acetamide. Examples of the compounds of general formula II are 1,1,1 ,3,3,3 hexamethyldisilazane, 1,1,1,3,3,3hexaethyldisilazane, 1,1,1 ,3,3,3 hexatrifluoromethyl disilazane and 1,1,1 triethyl 3,3,3 trimethyldisilazane. The compounds of general formula Ill include, for example, N,N bis trimethylsilyl urea and N,N bis triethylsilyl urea. On the other hand, as the compounds of general formula IV , there can be mentioned such compounds as trimethylsilylmethanesulfonic acid, triethylsilylmethanesulfonic acid and trimethylsilyltrifluoromethanesulfonic acid. The silylating agent is added in an amount of usually 0.5 to 10 parts by weight, preferably 1 to 5 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the conjugated diene polymer or its cyclized product.When the amount is added is less than 0.5 part by weight, the effect of improving the adhesion is inadequate, whereas when 10 parts by weight is exceeded, this also is undesirable because of an increase in the formation of pinholes. The conjugated diene polymer or its cyclized product used in this invention is chosen from the homopolymers of the conjugated dienes, copolymers of the conjugated dienes with other copolymerizable monomers, and the cyclized products of these polymers. As typical examples, included are natural rubber, polyisoprene, isoprene styrene copolymers, polybutadiene, and the cyclized products of these compounds. The weight average molecular weight of the conjugated diene polymer or its cyclized product usually ranges from 10,000 to 500,000. As typical examples of the organic solvents usable in this invention, included are the aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene and xylene halogentated hydrocarbons such as trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene, carbon tetrachloride, chlorobenzene and dichlorobenzene and oxygen containing hydrocarbons such as tetrahydrofuran and cyclohexanone. The proportion in which the conjugated diene polymer or its cyclized product is used relative to the organic solvent is suitably determined in accordance with the film thickness required. The former is usually used in an amount of 5 to 30 by weight to 95 to 70 by weight of the latter. Stated otherwise, the conjugated diene polymer or its cyclized product is used as a solution in the organic solvent in a concentration of 5 to 30 by weight. As the photocross linking agent to be used in this invention, usually used are the azides that are soluble in the organic solvents, such as 4,4 diazidostiibene, p phenylenebisazide, 4,4 diazidoben zophenone, 4,4 diazidochalcon, 2,6 bis 4 azidobenzal cyclohexanone, 2,6 bis 4 azidobenzal 4 methylcyclohexanone and 4,4 diazidodiphenyl. These photocross linking agents are usually used in an amount of 0.5 to 10 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the conjugated diene polymer or its cyclized product. In addition to the components described hereinabove, the photoresist composition may also contain a stabilizer, as required. The formation of a photoresist pattern using the photoresist composition of this invention is performed in customary manner. Specifically, the photoresist pattern is formed by proceeding through the steps of coating a substrate with the photoresist composition, followed by exposing the desired pattern through a mask, after which the development, rinsing and etching are performed. The use of the invention photoresist composition, as compared with the prior art, makes it possible to improve the adhesion between the photoresist pattern and such substrates as those of silicon oxide, phosphorus silicon glass, aluminum, etc. It thus becomes possible to prevent the separation of the resist pattern at the time of development and etching, with the consequence that the yield of the substrate can be improved. The following examples will serve to illustrate the present invention more specifically. In the examples and comparative examples the parts and percentages are on a weight basis unless otherwise indicated.EXAMPLE 1 Twelve grams of a cyclized product of 1,4polyisoprene obtained by using a lithium catalyst weight average molecular weight 150,000 uncyclized isoprene content 25 was dissolved in 88g of xylene. To the resulting solution were added 0.36g of 2.6 bis 4 azidobenzal 4 m ethylcyclohex anone as the photocross linking agent, 0.129 of 2,2 methylenebis 4 methyl 6 t butyl phenol as the stabilizer, and N trimethylsilylacetamide in a prescribed amount as the silylating agent to prepare a photoresist composition. The thus obtained con position was applied to a substrate having a silicon oxide film coating followed by heating the coated substrate at a temperature of 850C for 20 minutes to form on the substrate a prebaked film of the photoresist having a thickness of 1 micron.The prebaked photoresist film was then exposed for a prescribed period of time through a photomask having a test pattern formed thereon, using an exposing apparatus equipped with a 200 W high pressure mercury lamp Model PLA SOl F manufactured by Canon Company . This was followed by developing the exposed photoresist film by immersing it in a n heptane type developer for one minute, after which it was rinsed for one minute and then etched to give the intended photoresist pattern. The etching was carried out at 25 C for 15 minutes using an etchant having the composition ofHF 49 aqueous solution NH4F 40 aqueous solution water 1 6 10 volume ratio . The amount of the side etch the phenomenon in which the wafer below the photoresist pattern becomes etched as a result of the etchant making an intrusion thereto occurring at this time was measured.The results obtained are shown in Table 1.
