## Description
NOVEL INTERMEDIATES IN THE PREPARATION OF CYCLOPROPANE CARBOXYLATE ESTERS AND PROCESS FOR THEIR MANUFACTURE The invention relates to compounds which are useful intermediates in the preparation of cyclopropanecarboxylate esters.The invention also relates to a process for the preparation of these intermediates. The cyclopropanecarboxylatc esters are insccticidally active compounds known as pyrethroids and U they combine exceptionally good insecticidal properties with a very low mammalian toxicity, they are of considerable interest to the agrochemical industry and much effort has been expended in finding economic routes to them and to their principal intermediates. The general formula of one class of these pyrethroid com pounds may be represented as follows EMI1.1 where each asterisk denotes an asymmetric carbon atom each X is a halogen atom and R is a member of a group of radicals known to impart insecticidal activity to the molecule, e.g., 3 phenoxybenzyl or alpha cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl . It is known that the stereo isomeric form of the acid portion of the ester of formula I should be in the 1R,cis form for maximum insecticidal activity, i.e., the absolute configuration at carbon atom 1 is R and the two hydrogen atoms on carbon atoms 1 and 3 are in a cis relationship. This nomenclature is known as the Elliott nomenclature and is defined in M. Elliott,A.W. Farnham, N.F. James, P.H. Needham and D.A.Pullman,Mature, 19to 1 2h8, 710. It follows, therefore, that if these stereo isomeric esters of formula I are to be prepared, either a stereospecific chemical route is required or the desired stereoisomer must be obtained from a racemic form by physical separation techniques. The latter are expensive and laborious and not readily employed on an industrial scale. The Applicant has found a stereo specific route which uses as starting material the naturally occurling aibtance 3 carene whose formula is as follows EMI2.1 This compound is an inexpensive readily available natural terpene and the present application relates to intermediates in a route to the lR,cis acid portion of the pyrethroid ester of formula I starting from 3 carene. The present invention provides compounds of the general formula EMI2.2 wherein each Hal represents a halogen atom, especially chlorine or bromine, and R a group selected from EMI3.1 wherein R is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group, preferably containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms, e.g., a methyl group, or a saltforming cation, e.g., alkali metal, Ulonium or alkyl substituted ammonium. Preferably, the compounds of formula III are in the same stereo isomeric form as that of the cyclopropane ring of 3 carene. The three groups which R may represent in formula III may be named as follows i alkoxycarbonylmethyl or carboxymethyl and salts thereof, ii 2,2 dimethoxyethyl, and iii 2 methylcarbonyloxy 3 oxobutyl. Preferred compounds of the general formula III are methyl 2 2,2 dichlorovinyl 3,3 dimethylcyclopropyl acetate 2 2 2,2 dichlorovinyl 3,3 dimethylcyclopropyl ethanal dimethyl acetal and 1 E2 t2,2 dichlorovinyl 3,3 dimethylcyclopropylS 3 oxo 2 butyl acetate. Particularly preferred are those having the same stereoisomeric form as that of the cyclopropane ring of 3 carene, e.g., the compounds prepared in the Examples. The compounds and their preferred stereo isomeric form, according to the invention may be prepared by processes known per se, for example, according to the methods disclosed inU.K. Patent Specification 1,413,491 which discloses the preparation of dihalovinylcyclopropyl compounds by reacting 3 formyl 2,2dimethylcyclopropane carboxylate with a dihalomethylenephosphorane which can be prepared by reaction of a tri organophosphine, normally triphenylphosphine, with a carbon tetrahalide . The compounds and their isomers according to the invention are preferably prepared by a process characterized in that a a tri dialkylamino phosphine or an alkyl ester of an orthophosphorous acid bis dialkylamide is reacted with a tetrahalomethane or a trihalomethane and b the product resulting from the first step is reacted with an aldehyde of the general formula EMI4.1 wherein R has the same meaning as in the general formula III, both steps being carried out in the presence of a substantially inert solvent. Preferably step a is allowed to proceed to substantial completion. The alkyl groups present in the tri dialkylamino phosphine or the alkyl ester of an ortho phosphorous acid bis dialkylamide may be the same or different and linear or branched. The alkyl groups are suitably the same, have preferably less than six carbon atoms and more preferably less than three. The use of tri di√ÖaIkylamino phosphines is preferred, because they usually afford the compounds of formula III in a higher yield than the alkyl esters of ortho phosphorous acid bis dialkylamines the latter compounds are obtained by replacing one of the dialkylamino groups in a tn. dialkylamino phospnine by an alkoxy group . Tri di ethylamino phosphine and tri dimaethylenino phosphinc are nost preferred. Tri dialkylamino phosphines may be prepared by reaction of a dialkylamine with a phosphorous trihalide, as described in Organic Synthesis , Coll. Vol. V 1973 602 603. This reaction results in the formation of a solution of the tri dialkyiamino phosphine which also contains precipitated diallyla onium halide.According to a feature of the present invention a tri dialkylamino phosphine may be prepared by reacting a diallylamine vith a phosphorous trihalide in the presence of a substantially inert solvent. The resulting reaction mixture can then be vashed with water to remove unwanted by products whether or not after prior separation of the precipitated dialkyla onium halide and the tri dialkylamino phosphine dissolved in the washed solution reacted with the halomethane. It is not necessary to separate the precipitated dialkylammonium halide prior to washing, because this salt is water soluble.The yield of the compound of formula III can be further enhanced by drying the washed liquid, for example, over a solid drying agent such as anhydrous sodium sulphate or anhydrous magnesium sulphate. Another attractive feature of the process according to the present invention is that it may be carried out in the presence of an alkane solvent, for example, alkane solvents with a boiling point or boiling range up to 2000C. This also applies to the said reaction between a dialkylamine and a phosphorous trihalide. Examples of alkane solvents are pentane, hexane, heptane, octane and nonane. Mixtures of alkanes are very suitable, for example, gasolines having a boiling range from 62 C to 82 C or from 80 C to 110 C. If desired, the process may be carried out in substantially inert solvents other than alkanes, for example, in tetrahydrofuran. FsaQptes of tetrahalomethanes or trihalomethanes which are compounds capable of generating a dihalocarbene under the conditions of the process according to the present invention are carbon tetrahalides, chloroform, bromoform and iodoform.Very good results have been obtained with carbon tetrahalides. Examples of carbon tetranalides are carbon tetrachloride, carbon tetrabromide, carbon tetra iodide, bromotrichioromethane forming dichlorocarbene and dibromodifluoromethane forming difluorocarbene . Very good results have been obtained with carbon tetrachloride. These halomethanes may also act as solvent or co solvent for the process according to the in invention. Both steps of the process according to the present invention are preferably carried out at a temperature in the range of from 500C to 50QC, particularly at temperatures of from 200C to 350C. The compounds and process according to the invention are of interest as part of a multi step process to pyrethroid insecticides, e.g., esters based on 1R,cis 3 2,2 dichloro v inyl 2,2 dimethylcyclopropane carboxylic acid.For example alkyl 2 2, 2 dihalovinyl 3, 3 dimethylcyclopropylacetates can be converted into the appropriate pyrethroid acid according to the following reaction scheme EMI7.1 tb SEP H SEP CH CC12 SEP H SEP CHsCla tb SEP ss SEP hydrolysis SEP ss tb CR3 SEP CH2COOCR3 SEP cH32 COOH tb SEP C H SEP H tb SEP III SEP R i SEP Lialky tb SEP in SEP ther tb SEP HCH CCl2 SEP CH CCl2 tb SEP oxidation tb SEP SEP SEP with SEP a SEP per acid SEP tb SEP 32 SEP with SEP a SEP per acid tb CR SEP CR SEP CO Alkyl SEP Cur3 SEP CR SEP 2 O CO Allyl tb SEP CR3 SEP H SEP H tb SEP hydro SEP sis tb SEP 7 tb SEP H SEP CH CCl SEP CHPCC1 SEP via SEP the SEP H SEP CH.CCl2 tb SEP 2 SEP oxidation SEP via SEP the tb SEP aldehyde SEP vith SEP a tb SEP per SEP acl tb CH3 SEP SEP SEP CH2OH SEP CH3 SEP acid SEP COOT tb SEP CH3 SEP H SEP CH3 SEP H tb SEP I SEP Ruth tb This reaction scheme illustrates the manufacture of the pyrethroid 1R,cis acid Compound I R H from one of the novel compounds according to the invention III R i which itself is readily available from the naturally occurring compound 3 carene.
