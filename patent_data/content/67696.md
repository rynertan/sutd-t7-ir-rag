# Gradient index lens array.

## Abstract
A gradient index lens array 24 used in an optical imaging system is modified so as to compensate for factors creating a non uniform image exposure at an image plane. Various parameters of the individual fibers 26, 28 compris ing the array, such as index gradient, radii and packing density, are selectively modified so as to obtain a desired exposure profile.
