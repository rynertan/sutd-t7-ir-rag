# FABRIC SURFACED MOLDED COMPOSITE ARTICLE AND PROCESS FOR ITS PREPARATION

## Abstract
A fabric surfaced molded composite article comprising a web of a fabric 2 , an intermediate layer 3 of a synthetic resin lining the fabric web and an outer layer 15 of a synthetic resin which is fusion bonded to the intermediate layer 3 . The fabric web 2 and the intermediate layer 3 are initially prepared in the form of a laminated sheet structure 1 , which is then processed in a mold operable as a vacuum forming mold for forcing the laminated sheet structure 1 to be deformed into predetermined configuration by a suction developed in the mold and further as an injection mold into which a synthetic resin of a molten state is injected to form the outer layer 15 of the synthetic resin on the intermediate layer 3 of the synthetic resin.
