# Method and device for determining a radiation attenuation distribution in a plane of a body.

## Abstract
For the backprojection of the convoluted measurement signals in a cartesian coordinate system in a computer tomography device, it is necessary to recalculate the weighting factors for each position of the source 1 in order to determine the contribution of a convoluted measurement signal to the attenuation value associated with a given element ε of the output image matrix. This is a time consuming and hence expensive form of reconstruction, and can be avoided by storing all the weighting factors required this, however, implies a very large memory, and is also expensive. The invention relates to the use of a matrix of elements ε organised in polar coordinates, which is stored in the memory, 17a the origin central coordinate 40 of said matrix coinciding with the centre 9 of rotation of the X ray source 1 about the object section 7 . The weighting factors are also stored in a polar organized memory 17b . The angular component of the address of the weighting factors is incremented with a rotational increment in the corresponding position of the X ray source 1 , so that for each group of measurement values, the same weighting factors can be used. The invention enables all the weighting factors to be stored in a memory 17g of limited capacity, the more so because all weighting factors are mirror symmetrical with respect to a central axis connecting the X ray source 1 to the centre 9 of rotation, so that the angular coordinates of the memory 17 need only extend from 0 to π instead of from 0 to 2π.
