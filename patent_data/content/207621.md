## Description
The present invention relates to functional polymers, to their production, and to intermediates therein. In particular, it relates to polymers comprising a main chain of carbon carbon bonds and pendant functional groups appended to the main chain via a carbonyliminocarbonyl CONHCO linkage. In recent years, a great variety of polymers have been artificially produced and used in various fields. There are still demands for new polymers having better physical properties. It is an object of the present invention to provide polymers having good elasticity, good adhesion and favourable dispersibility. EP A 0037590 discloses a polymer that comprises a main chain of carbon carbon bonds and at least one pendant functional group of the formula According to the present invention, a novel functional polymer has a molecular weight of 1,000 to 100,000, a main chain of carbon carbon bonds and 0.1 to 99.9 by weight of one or more pendant functional groups of the formula Novel intermediates have the formula In step 1 a , the polymerisation may be carried out by a per se conventional procedure, particularly by solution polymerisation. For instance, a monomeric mixture comprising the alkenoyl isocyanate I and optionally one or more polymerisable monomers in an inert solvent, preferably comprising a polymerisation initiator, is maintained at a temperature of 20 to 200 C, favourably of 60 to 150 C, more favourably of 80 to 110 C, for 0.5 to 5 hours. If used, the amount of the polymerisation initiator may be from 0.1 to 10 by weight, preferably from 0.5 to 5 by weight, based on the total weight of the monomers. When desired, a chain transfer agent may be also present in the reaction system. The amount of the chain transfer agent is usually from 5 to 20 by weight, based on the total weight of the monomers. In step 1 b , the addition may be also carried out by a per se conventional procedure. For instance, the isocyanatocarbonyl group containing polymer is reacted with the functional group containing compound II in an inert solvent at a temperature of 20 to 100 C, preferably of 0 to 80 C, more preferably at room temperature or under cooling with ice. A second process for preparing a functional polymer of the invention comprises 2 a adding a compound of formula II as defined above to an alkenoyl isocyanate of formula I as defined above and 2 b polymerising the resulting novel intermediates as defined above and, optionally, one or more other polymerisable monomers, the monomers containing at least 0.1 by weight of said intermediate. In step 2 a , the addition may be carried out by a per se conventional procedure. For instance, the alkenoyl isocyanate I is reacted with the functional group containing compound II in an inert solvent at a temperature of 20 to 100 C, preferably of 0 to 80 C, more preferably at room temperature or under cooling with ice. In step 2 b , the polymerisation may be also carried out by a per se conventional procedure, particularly by solution polymerisation. For instance, a monomeric mixture comprising the intermediate, i.e. a functional group introduced isocyanatocarbonyl group containing compound and, optionally, one or more polymerisable monomers in an inert solvent, preferably comprising a polymerisation initiator, is maintained at a temperature of 20 to 200 C, favourably of 60 to 150 C, more favourably of 80 to 120 C, for 0.5 to 5 hours. If used, the amount of the polymerisation initiator may be from 0.1 to 10 by weight, preferably from 0.5 to 5 by weight, based on the total weight of the monomers. When desired, a chain transfer agent may be also present in the reaction system. The amount of the chain transfer agent is usually from 5 to 20 by weight based on the total weight of the monomers. The starting alkenoyl isocyanate I can be produced by reacting an alkenylamide of the formula wherein X is a halogen atom e.g. chlorine, bromine and subjecting the latter to decomposition. For production of the alkenyloxazolinedione hydrohalide VI , it is preferred that the oxalyl halide IV is first charged into a reactor and then the alkenylamide III is portionwise added thereto, whereby the reaction proceeds. The molar ratio of the alkenylamide III and the oxalyl halide IV may be usually about 1 1 3, preferably about 1 1 1.5. The use of an inert solvent as the reaction medium is not essential but is usually preferred. Thus, either one or both of the alkenylamide III and the oxalyl halide IV may be previously dissolved or suspended therein. The reaction temperature is normally higher than 50 C and lower than the decomposition temperature of the alkenyloxazolinedione hydrohalide VI , preferably from about 0 to 40 C. From the industrial viewpoint, the temperature around boom temperature or under ice cooling is favorable. For separation of the alkenyloxazolinedione hydrohalide VI from the reaction mixture, there may be adopted any per se conventional separation procedure such as filtration or distillation under reduced pressure. Addition of seed crystals of the alkenyloxazolinedione hydrohalide VI to the reaction mixture may be sometimes favorable to accelerate the precipitation of the alkenyloxazolinedione hydrohalide VI . However, separation of the alkenyloxazolinedione hydrohalide VI from the reaction mixture is not necessarily required. The alkenyloxazolinedione hydrohalide VI is then subjected to decomposition under the condition affording the alkenoyl isocyanate I predominantly or suppressing by production of the haloalkanoyl isocyanate V . One typical example of such condition is to carry out the decomposition under an ordinary pressure atmospheric or autogenic . Namely, the alkenyloxazolinedione hydrohalide VI as charged in a reactor is heated under an ordinary pressure until the decomposition proceeds sufficiently. When a reaction medium is used, the heat decomposition can take place at such a low temperature as about 40 C. In the absence of any reaction medium, heating up to the decomposition temperature of the 2 alkenyloxazolinedione hydrohalide e.g. about 102 to 103 C in case of 2 isopropenyloxazoline 4,5 dione hydrochloride is required. As the reaction medium, there may be used an inert solvent. Another example of the condition is to carry out the decomposition in the presence of a hydrogen halide eliminating agent. Namely, decomposition of the alkenoyloxazoline hydrohalide VI in the presence of a hydrogen halide eliminating agent at a temperature of 50 to 200 C, preferably from 0 to 150 C under an ordinary or reduced pressure gives predominantly the alkenoyl isocyanate I . As the hydrogen halide eliminating agent such as not having an active hydrogen atom or as being reacted with a hydrogen halide not to produce an active hydrogen atom is favorably used. Amines which are the most popular hydrogen halide eliminating agents are hardly usable in the process of this invention. Specific examples of the preferred hydrogen halide eliminating agent are metal complex compounds e.g. Ph₃P ₂Ru CO ₃, Ph₃P ₃Pt , metal halides e.g. lithium chloride, titanium tetrachloride, aluminum chloride, cuprous chloride , synthetic zeolite e.g. molecular sieve, microporous glass , etc. The hydrogen halide eliminating agent is used normally in an amount of about 0.1 to 100 mol, preferably of about 0.1 to 10 mol to 1 mol of the alkenyloxazolinedione hydrohalide VI . Any reaction medium is not necessarily required to use. When used, an inert solvent may be employed. Another example of the conditition is to carry out the decomposition in the presence of a liquid medium having a dielectric constant of not more than 4. Such liquid medium may be constituted with one or more of inert solvents chosen from aliphatic or alicyclic hydrocarbons e.g. pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, decalin, cyclohexane , aromatic hydrocarbons e.g. benzene, toluene, xylene, naphthalene , ethers e.g. propyl ether, butyl ether, dioxane, isopropyl ether , esters, halogenated hydrocarbons e.g. carbon tetrachloride , etc. A dielectric constant of not more than 4 may be attained by the use of a single solvent or by the use of two or more solvents in combination. The decomposition may be carried out by keeping the alkenyloxazolinedione hydrohalide VI in a liquid medium of not more than 4 in dielectric constant at a temperature higher than the decomposition temperature of the alkenyloxazolinedione hydrohalide VI , usually from about 40 to 150 C, preferably from about 60 to 120 C, whereby the alkenoyl isocyanate I is predominantly produced. Recovery of the alkenoyl isocyanate I from the reaction mixture may be accomplished by a per se conventional separation procedure such as distillation under atmospheric or reduced pressure. In any of the above reactions and the post treatments, a small amount of a polymerization inhibitor may be incorporated into the reaction system or the reaction mixture for prevention of the unnecessary polymerization on the double bond. Examples of the polymerization inhibitor are hydroquinone, p methoxyphenol, 2,6 di t butyl 4 methylphenol, 4 t butylcatechol, bisdihydroxybenzylbenzene, 2,2 methylene bis 6 t butyl 3 methylphenol , 4,4 butylidene bis 6 t butyl 3 methylphenol , 4,4 thiobis 6 t butyl 3 methylphenol , p nitrosophenol, diisopropylxanthogenesulfide, N nitrosophenylhydroxylamine ammonium salt, 1,1 diphenyl 2 picrylhydrazil, 1,3,5 triphenylpheldazyl, 2,6 di t butyl alpha 3,5 di t butyl 4 oxo 2,5 cyclohexadien 1 ylidene p trioxy, 2,2,6,6 tetramethyl 4 piperidone 1 oxil, dithiobenzoyl sulfide, p,p ditolyl trisulfide, p,p ditolyl tetrasulfide, dibenzyl tetrasulfide, and tetraethylthiuram disulfide. The alkenoyl isocyanates I are, in general, obtained in the form of a liquid which is stable at room temperature. They can therefore be handled with ease. They are soluble in various organic solvents can be used in solution form.
