# Improvements in wood veneers.

## Abstract
A method of producing a continuous length of flexible real wood veneer according to which the veneer leaves are bonded to a non woven material strip such as bonded viscose rayon which is then severed between the veneer leaves to form foil backed leaves, which leaves are cut with male and female fin ger ends enabling said leaves to be mated end to end and bonded together into a continuous length. A plastics or plas tics composite foil such as PVC non woven material compo site foil is applied as secondary backing to the non woven ma terial backed veneer, which preferably has a total thickness of about 0.40 mm, including a real wood veneer thickness of 0.15 mm. The invention also relates to a continuous length of veneer produced by the method.
