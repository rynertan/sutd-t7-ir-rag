# Video signal processing arrangement.

## Abstract
A video signal processing arrangement for television sig nals encoded in digital form comprises means 11 for com pressing and or expanding the size of the television picture represented by the video signal and means 6 for rotating the television picture represented by the video signal. The rotating means 6 is separate from the compressing and or expanding means 11 and is switchable 2,6,5,8 between a position prior to the compressing and or expanding means 11 in the video signal processing chain and a position sub sequent to the compressing and or expanding means 11 . An arrangement having two separate video signal paths which are later combined to produce a composite picture is also described in which the rotating means can also be po sitioned after the combining means as well as before or after the compressing and or expanding means in either path.
