## Description
HEPATITIS B VACCt AND FOR FOR ITS PREPARATION The present invention relates to a lyophilized preparation of a hepatitis B vaccine. More particularly, it relates to an improved lyophilized preparation of a hepatitis B vaccine which is obtained by lyophilizing an inactivated purified hepatitis B virus surface antigen in the presence of aluminum gel and a stabilizer. Hepatitis B vaccine is going to be developed inJapan, and in the United States of America, it has already been commercially available. The product available in theUnited States is a liquid preparation containing 20 g ml of hepatitis B virus surface antigen hereinafter, referred to HBsAg . Hepatitis B vaccine is usually prepared by using a highly purified HBsAg which is isolated from HBsAg positive human serum, and hence, it is very valuable. Hepatitis B vaccine is effective for prophylaxis of infection of the virus in people engaged in the medical fields, researchers who occasionally meet with hepatitis B patients and latent virus carriers who look like heaIthy persons hereinafter, referred to briefly as healthy carriers as well as families of the patients and healthy carriers and babies, wherein the virus is infected via blood. It is said that healthy carriers are usually found at the rate of 2 to the 3 of total population in Japan and 10 to 15 in SoutheastAsia and also in Africa. Thus, it is required to make available the hepatitis B vaccine worldwide. Besides, in order to effectively use the valuable vaccine, it is essential to provide a preparation which is stable and can be kept for a long period of time. It is known that an inactivated vaccine is prepared by incorporating as an adjuvant, for example, aluminum gel, in order to enhance the formation of antibodies within the body when the vaccine is administered.Hepatitis B vaccine preparations also usually contain analuminum gel. In order to prepare a lyophilized preparation of hepatitis B vaccine, first HBsAg must be dissolved in a saline solution for injection or distilled water for injection and then the solution is mixed with aluminum gel.In such a method, the adsorption of HBsAg onto the aluminum gel varies in each minimum usage unit vial depending on the order of steps for the preparation, temperature, conditions for shake mixing, etc., hence the immunogenic activity may vary in each vaccine. Thus, it will be required to fill an HBsAg containing solution into each minimum usage unit vial in the state that HBsAg is adsorbed onto aluminum gel, so that each vial for minimum usage unit in the same production lot has the same antigen titer of vaccine. By the way, when HBsAg is lyophilized as in the conventional liquid preparation, the antigen titer is lowered during the drying step. Thus, it is necessary to lyophilize HBsAg in the presence of a stabilizer, but it has never been known under what conditions the lyophilization ofHBsAg can be done in the presence of aluminum gel and further how the lyophilization conditions affect the stability of the preparation. The present inventors have intensively examined the lyophilization conditions of HBsAg adsorbed on aluminum gel, under which such problems as lowering of antigen titer or deteriations of properties do not occur, but result in the desired lyophilized preparation having greater storage stability than the conventional liquid preparations. They further examined the composition for the suitable stable preparation. As a result, it has been found that the desired lyophilized preparation can be prepared by adsorbing purified HBsAg onto aluminum gel in a suspension state, dissolving a stabilizer and optionally a preservative in the suspension, and then lyophilizing the mixture. An object of the present invention is to provide an improved lyophilized preparation of hepatitis B vaccine.Another object of the invention is to provide a lyophilization method of HBsAg for obtain alyophilized hepatitis B vaccine having excellent storage stability.These and other objects and advantages of the invention will be apparent to skilled person from the following description. The starting purified HBsAg can be prepared fromHBsAg positive human serum by conventional purification methods, such as ultracentrifugation, iron exchange chromatography, gel filtration chromatography, or the like.When the purified HBsAg is used as a vaccine, it is usually inactivated, for example, by subjecting it to heat treatment at 600C for 10 hours, or to treatment with 0.05 V V formalin at 370C for 96 hours. The inactivated, purifiedHBsAg is regulated to a protein content of not more than 0.1W V , preferably not more than 0.02 W V , usually 0.005 to 0.02 W V . For the adsorption of HBsAg onto aluminum gel theHBsAg and the aluminum gel are used in a weight ratio of 1 3 to 1 10. The adsorption is carried out by mixing an HBsAg containing solution with an aluminum gel containing solution, or by adding an aluminum chloride containing solution to an HBsAgcontaining solution, and adding thereto an aqueous sodium hydroxide solution having an appropriate concentration, by which aluminum hydroxide gel is produced and simultaneouslyHBsAg is adsorbed thereto. When an aqueous trisodium phosphate solution is used instead of the aqueous sodium hydroxide solution, aluminum phosphate gel is produced andHBsAg is adsorbed thereto. Thus, the aluminum gel used in the present invention includes aluminum hydroxide gel and aluminum phosphate gel.The HBsAg containing solution is usually an aqueous solution of a neutral salt, such as physiological saline solution. The neutral salt includes sodium chloride, potassium chloride, magnesium chloride. The preferred neutral salt is sodium chloride, which may be used as a mture with other neutral salts as mentioned above. The neutral salts are usually contained in a concentration of 0.1 to 3 W V , preferably 0.5 to 2 W V . The HBsAg adsorbed aluminum gel suspension thus obtained is mixed with a stabilizer and optionally a preservative, and then, the mixture is lyophilized. The stabilizer includes amino acids and polysaccharides. The amino acids and polysaccharides may be used either one alone, but preferably both are used together. Colloidal substances may also optionally be added as a stabilizer. Suitable examples of the amino acids are glycine, alanine, glutaminic acid, arginine, lysine, etc. or a salt thereof e.g. monosodium glutamate . They may be used alone or in combination of two or more thereof, and they are usually used in an amount of 0.1 to 2.0 W V . Suitable examples of polysaccharides are monosaccharides such as glucose, xylose, galactose, fructose, etc., disaccharides such as lactose, maltose, saccharose, etc., and sugar alcohols such as mannitol, sorbitol, xylitol, etc., which may be used alone or in combination of two or more thereof. They are usually used in an amount of 0.1 to. 15 W V .Suitable examples of colloidal substances are gelatin, human albumin, dextrane, etc. They are usually used in an amount of 0 to 0.1 W V . Besides, the above mentioned neutral salt may be added to the solution so as to regulate the content of the neutral salt in the suitable range at this stage. The thus prepared inactivated, purified HBsAg solution which contains the aluminum gel and a stabilizer is subdivided and filled into vials for each dosage unit package in an amount of 20g to 1,000 Ag each. The solution in each vial is lyophilized by the conventional rapid lyophilization method or the slow lyophilization method to give the desired lyophilized preparation. The lyophilization is preferably carried out under the following conditions. The solution is subjected to a pre lyophilization at a low temperature e.g. 400C or lower, preferably 500C or lower under atmospheric pressure for several hours e.g. 3 to 10 hours , and then subjected to first lyophilization at a fixed higher temperature e.g. 0 to 80C under reduced pressure e.g. 0.01 to 0.05 Torr for at least ten hours e.g. 15 hours , at which stage the temperature of the product becomes lower than 35 C e.g. about 380C .Thereafter, the product is subjected to a second lyophilization at a fixed elevated temperature e.g. 25O to 300C under a more reduced pressure e.g. 0.001 to 0.005Torr for several to ten hours e.g. 6 to 10 hours, preferably 7 to 9 hours . The lyophilized preparation contains at leastHBsAg, a neutral salt, aluminum gel and a stabilizer. The lyophilized preparation of hepatitis B vaccine thus obtained has good storage stability and a stable antigen titer. It can be dissolved rapidly in an injection solution when used. When the lyophilized preparation of the present invention is used, it is dissolved in distilled water for injection or physiological saline solution for injection so as to obtain a HBsAg protein concentration of 5 ag ml to 40 Ag ml and to obtain an approximately isotonic solution.The physiologically isotonic solution is administered subcutaneously. The dose of the vaccine is usually in the range of 5 ssg to 40 ssg as HBsAg protein for one administration in adults. The preparation of the present invention shows no abnormal toxicity when tested in accordance with the conventional test method in guinea pigs as defined by theMinimum Requirements of Biological Products issued by theMinistry of Health and Welfare, Japan July 1969 . It was also experimentally confirmed by clinical tests, phase II, that the preparation of the present invention is stable and effective. The present invention is illustrated by the following Examples and Reference Examples but should not be construed to be limited thereto. Example 1 An inactivated, purified HBsAg which is prepared from HBsAg positive human serum by purifying it in a conventional manner, i.e. by density gradient centrifugation using sucrose and cesium chloride, followed by an.inactivation treamen . To a solution of the inactivated, purified HBsAg in a physiological saline solution HBsAg protein concentration 128 eg ml is added an aqueous solution of aluminum chloride in an amount of 8 times the weight based on the weight of aluminum hydroxide of the HBsAg protein. Thissolution is adjusted to pH 6.7 with 1N NaOH, by which aluminum hydroxide gel is produced and simultaneously HBsAg is adsorbed thereon. The HBsAg adsorbed aluminum gel suspension is divided, and each suspension is centrifuged.After removing the supernatant, to each HBsAg adsorbed aluminum gel are added aqueous soiitions of various kinds of stabilizers and preservatives to give vaccine solutions as shown in Table 1. 1 ml each of these solutions is packed in a 2 ml vial and is subjected to pre lyophilization at 500C, under atmospheric pressure for 6 hours, after reducing the pressure to 0.04 Torr, subjected to the first lyophilization at SOC for 15 hours, and then subjected to the second lyophilization at 300C, under a pressure of 0.005 Torr for 8 hours, by which the desired lyophilization preparation is obtained.

Sci. Biol., 32, 47 52 1979 . In brief, using AUSRIA II supplied from DainabbottRadioisotope Lab., Tokyo, Japan , reference for assay was prepared in a concentration of l g ml HBsAg protein and stored in 800C after subdivision. The dilution of HBsAg was carried out by employing a dilution buffer of 0.01 M phosphate buffered saline PBS containing 0.1 human serum albumin and 0.1 polyethylene glycol PEG 4000 .
