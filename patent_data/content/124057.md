# Optical glass fiber coated with cationically curable polyepoxide mixtures.

## Abstract
Freshly drawn optical glass fiber is protected by coating it with an ultraviolet initiated, cationically curable liquid coating composition comprising a cationically curable polyepoxide, a polysiloxane carrying a plurality of hydroxyalkyl groups, and a photoinitiator and or photosensitizer for an ultraviolet activat ed cationic cure. The coatings are of low modulus and retain a low modulus at temperatures as low as 60 C.
