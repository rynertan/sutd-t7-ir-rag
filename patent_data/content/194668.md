# DEWAR APPARATUS

## Abstract
An improved detector dewar assembly in which the flange supporting the upper cap 18, 20 of the dewar assembly comprises a disc ceramic matrix 40 , including buried electrical leads 66, 67 . This disc serves several purposes. First, it provides a vacuum tight electric feedthrough which connects a tape cable 36 from the detector assembly 14 to a pin assembly 64 imbedded in the exterior portion of the disc feedthrough. Second, it includes metalizations 108, 90 on its top and lower surface in order to provide a surface for connecting by brazing or soldering the upper cap 18, 20 assembly and the major vessel wall 15 . A tape cable 36 comprising wires 80 embedded in a flexible nonconductive matrix connects the detector element leadout wires with the electrical connectors of the feedthrough disc. The cable forms a collar which substantially surrounds the coldwell 10 and has tabs 84 at its basal portion which fold up to attach to pin or pad connectors 62 on the lower surface of the disc. The use of Manganin, Constantan, or Balco wires produces a tape cable which significantly reduces the heat load on the dewar refrigerator system. Solder bond rings and pads 110, 112, 114, 116 positioned both on the endwell and disc assembly mate to solder bond rings and pads dots positioned on the tape cable thereby providing stress relief.

## Description
The present invention relates to a dewar apparatus according to the preamble of claim 1 as used in thermal imaging systems. In most thermal imaging systems using semiconductor detection devices which must be cryogenically cooled, it is necessary to provide a housing or dewar for the detector device. The dewar must thermally isolate yet provide electrical connections between the detector array and the housing exterior so that the array may be electrically interfaced to other signal processing subassemblies. Typically, these dewars include several concentric cylindrical tubes or housings. The inner tube is generally comprised of a long cylindrical glass bore which opens to the base of the dewar. This bore, often referred to as the coldwell , is multifunctional. First, the detector device or array is mounted at the top of the coldwell the endwell . A cold finger or cryogenic cooling device is generally inserted into the bore of the coldwell to effect cooling of the detector array. Often the surfaces of the coldwell within the vacuum space are metalized and then etched or delineated in order to define conductive leads which run the length of the bore. Past dewars have used a gold plated glass bore to provide a thermally reflective shield which reduces radiation heat load. In addition, glass has been used because it has the advantage that it is both a good electrical insulator and a poor thermal conductor. Moreover, glass is not ductile and once fixed in the system, alignment will remain true unless the bore breaks. However, the glass coldwell has the disadvantage that it is extremely fragile and requires complex and expensive assembly techniques. In some prior art dewars, the base portion of the coldwell supports a flange to which a cap is attached. This cap is typically made of some metal which has appropriate structural and thermal properties and can maintain a hard vacuum. The top part of the cap directly above the detector array holds a transmissive window. One type of dewar is shown in the article entitled Automatic Testing Of Infrared Detector Arrays , D. A. Jones, SPIE, Vol. 344, Infrared Sensor Technology 1982 . In such a dewar, the flange comprises a monolithic ceramic disc with a center through hole. The upper surface of such a ceramic disc includes a radial pattern of electrically conductive paths from the inside diameter to the outside diameter. The delineated conductors from the detector device that are on the coldwell are connected via jumper wires to the inside diameter portion of the conductor paths on the ceramic disc. The opposite end of the conductive paths on the outside diameter portion of the ceramic disc connect to a pin assembly covering substantially all of the disc outside the vacuum chamber. A tape cable connects these pins to a bias resistor board or pack and or an external connector located on the protective dewar housing. A fused dielectric ring covers the conductive paths on the inner portion of the ceramic disc providing an electrically insulated, vacuum tight surface. A metal ring is fused onto the dielectric ring for soldering purposes. Similarly, a metalization is deposited on the other side of the ceramic disc. The upper vacuum cap is attached to the ceramic by soldering and the lower base is attached to the ceramic by brazing to the metalized ring. The above described design has some disadvantages. The attachment of the upper cap to the dielectric surface of the monolithic ceramic forms a relatively weak joint which is easily damaged during handling. Also, the use of conductive paths on the surface of the ceramic disc tends to create, in combination with the dielectric fusing process, a joint which may develop vacuum leaks. Further, the dispersed pin configuration makes in process electrical testing difficult because the inner most pins are not readily accessible. In a second dewar design, a metal flange, bonded appropriately to the glass coldwell, serves primarily as a supporting member for the vacuum chamber cap and window. The base portion of the glass coldwell is thickened so that it may include buried conductive wires which surface above and below the flange providing an electrical exit from the vacuum chamber. Gold wires are used to connect the axial leads on the coldwell to both the detector array and to the surfaced conductors on the coldwell above the flange. The conductors surfacing below the flange outside the vacuum may be connected to a conventional tape cable or other wiring device. In either of these designs, a second larger flange may be connected to the coldwell at its base. This flange supports an outer protective housing which encloses the vacuum chamber, as well as supporting the mounting flange for the dewar. The housing has openings for the end of the vacuum cap and the electrical connectors. In either design, a tape cable or other wiring device connects from the vacuum exit conductors to standard electrical interconnects. This tape cable generally takes the form of a copper conductor pattern electrodeposited on a Polyimide Kapton sheet. The tape cable is usually multilayered. These prior designs have several disadvantages. First, to repair the detector array or other connections within the vacuum chamber, the entire device must be disassembled the outer housing and the vacuum cap removed. Second, since the coldwell is made of glass, the device is particularly susceptible to breakage during assembly, disassembly, and normal in house and end item use. Third, the gold jumper wires used at the array, flange and at the buried lead connections are susceptible to breakage. Fourth, the volume of the vacuum chamber is usually a small percentage of that of the finished assembly, such that when materials outgas into the vacuum chamber, the vacuum degrades at a high rate. Finally, because the design uses many parts and requires use of complex assembly techniques, the cost per unit is usually high. Accordingly, it is a primary object of the present invention to provide an improved detector dewar assembly. This object is achieved by the characterizing features of claim 1. Further advantageous embodiments of the invention may be taken from the subclaims. The present invention provides a dewar vessel having a metal coldwell, a single vessel providing simultaneously a vacuum chamber, an internal tape cable and hermetically sealed pin connector s in an annular disc assembly in order to provide connection between the detector array and external signal processing devices. The stress relieved tape cable minimizes heat load, while reducing the total number of electrical interconnections. As a result of fewer component parts and simplified assembly techniques, system reliability is increased and the total system cost is decreased. The above and other objects of the present invention are achieved in the illustrative embodiment as described with respect to the Figures in which Referring to Figures 1A and 1B, the apparatus of the present invention includes a metal coldwell 10 with endwell 12 which supports detector assembly 14 a vacuum vessel 15 having a base 22, flange wall member 16, protective shield ring 27, lower cap ring 18 and upper cap 20 with transmissive window 24. A flexible tape cable 36, in the shape of a top hat without the top horizontal surface , provides electrical connection between detector assembly 14 and external pin connector assembly 38. The support ring 46 provides a mounting plane for the external pin connector assembly 38. Ceramic disc 40, the main structural member of connector assembly 38, forms a portion of the vacuum wall of dewar 15 as shown. A conventional pinch off tube 28 used for evacuating the dewar and getter feedthroughs 30 which absorbs outgassed materials within the evacuated chamber are mounted through flange wall member 16 in a conventional manner. Base 22 and other vacuum chamber members 10, 12, 16, 18, 20 and 24 described above, may be made of any material which is mechanically rigid, has appropriate thermal properties, can hold a vacuum and does not outgas impurities at an unacceptable rate when evacuated. Typically, the metal members will be made of stainless steel, Kovar or some other metal which may be easily assembled by, for example, soldering, welding or brazing techniques. Similarly, shield ring 27 may be made of any mechanically durable and formable material, such as plastic or metal. Upper cap 20 may be attached to lower cap 18 by soldering. Upper cap 20 may be easily removed to provide direct access to detector assembly 14, as well as elements 12 and 36. Coldwell 10 may be made of any material which is readily attached to base 22 and which has low thermal conductivity, and high mechanical strength. The wall thickness of coldwell 10 is minimized to reduce thermal conduction. In addition, the external surface of coldwell 10 may be coated to provide a thermally reflective surface to lower the radiation heat load of the dewar. The flexible tape cable 36 provides electrical connection between detector assembly 14 and external pin connector assembly 38. As shown in Figures 2A and 2B, the tape cable 36 of the present invention comprises a series of wires 80 embedded in or on a flexible nonconductive base 82. Wires 80 extend beyond base 82 on the upper portion of tape cable 36 in order to facilitate connection to the endwell 12. The lower portion of the tape cable is cut to form tabs 84. Tabs 84 contain the base ends of wires 80 which terminate in pin receptacles 86, which may be soldered or otherwise fastened to pins 62 at the base of disc 40, as shown in Figures 1B and 3. In an alternative embodiment not shown , pin receptacles 86 can be replaced with bump pads which may be soldered, spotwelded, or bonded ultrasonic or thermosonic to raised conductive pads rather than pins 62 positioned on the base of disc 40. As shown in Figure 2A, the shape of cable 36, particularly the shape of tabs 84 and holes 87, provide a form which may be substantially wrapped around coldwell 10 as shown in Figure 2B. Tabs 84 with receptacles 86 may be bent out from the coldwell 10 at substantially a ninety degree angle to provide electrical connection to the pins 62 on disc 40. Slots 83 provide additional flexibility and alignment of the upper portion of cable 36. Wires 80 might be comprised of Manganin, Constantan, Balco or an equivalent material having high thermal resistance. Base 82 might comprise a thin sheet of Polyimide material or Paralyene to which has been adhered a metal foil which is etched to form wires 80. A modified acrylic adhesive or the equivalent is used which will not outgas into the dewar vessel 15 at an unacceptable rate. In an alternative embodiment, the metal film or wires 80 may be electrodeposited on base 82. A second layer of Polyimide or Paralyene may be positioned over base 82 and wires 80 to form a protective layer 85. If necessary, exterior surface 124 of layer 85 may be coated with gold or a similar material to further reduce the radiative heat load of tape cable 36. Stress relief may be achieved in tape cable 36 by a variety of features. One feature is the use of solder pads 112 and solder band 114 which are positioned, respectively, on exterior surface 124 of layer 85 over tabs 84 and on the interior surface of base 82 near wire ends 118, as shown in Figure 2B. Solder band or dots 114 are soldered to a metalized band 116 positioned on ceramic skirt 117 of endwell 12 as shown in Figure 3, thus stabilizing tape cable 36 with respect to coldwell 10 and leaving wire ends 118 in a position to be easily bonded to the conductive endwell pattern 120 which provides electrical connection, via jumper wires 122, to detector assembly 14. Similarly, solder pads or dots 112 are soldered to metalizations 110 deposited on or embedded in disc 40 as shown in Figure 3. In addition, slits 83, run longitudinally along the upper portion of tape cable 36 thereby providing alignment and strain relief on cable 36 which might result from the differential expansion and contraction of coldwell 10 and tape cable 36. Now referring to Figures 1A, 1B and 3, external pin connector assembly 38 comprises feedthrough disc 40, bias resistor board 42 and pins 64 and 62. Feedthrough disc 40 is made of a ceramic or other insulating material capable of holding a hard vacuum. Feedthrough disc 40 comprises multiple layers 68, 70 and 72 of material which are attached, as shown in Figure 3. Electrical connection is made through assembly 40 from pins or pads 62 to pins 64 by a combination of vias 66 and conductor tracks 67 made through and across the surfaces of layers 68, 70 and 72 as shown. It is noted that only one representative conductive path between one of several connector pins of connectors 62 and 64 is shown. In addition, disc 40 may include many more layers, as required by the manufacturing process and pin layout. Similarly, disc 40 may be cut into two or more individual connectors attached to vessel 15 in like fashion. Disc 40 is brazed to support flange 46 which is soldered, brazed or electron beam welded to wall 16 and protective ring 17. Disc 40 is brazed to support flange 46 and lower cap ring 18 at metalizations 90 and 108, respectively, as shown in Figure 3. Since a ceramic material is used for disc 40, metalizations 90 and 108, as well as stress relief metalization 110, may be cofired during the manufacture of disc 40, in order to provide a surface on the ceramic which may be brazed or soldered. This technique provides a significantly stronger bond than that attainable by prior techniques of soldering or brazing to a metal fused to a dielectric deposition. The embodiment shown in Figure 3 provides several additional advantages. First, placement of metalizations 90 and 108 and attachment of lower cap ring 18 on the top of layer 68 of disc 40 reduces the stress on disc 40 which may be caused by the differential expansion and contraction of support flange 46, lower cap ring 18 and cap 20. Second, by placing lower cap ring 18 on the upper surface of layer 68, the tolerances on cap 18 may be relaxed because exact radial positioning is not required. In addition, the embodiment shown in Figure 3 is easily manufactured, since gravity, rather than surface tension, holds the brazing material in place during manufacture. This brazing configuration provides several other advantages. First, the cofired metalizations 90 and 108 provide brazing surfaces which are more resistant to handling or end use breakage than the monolithic ceramic flange with the fused metal dielectric ring technique previously used. Second, the design of the dewar apparatus of the present invention has substantially fewer parts, and requires simpler and less costly assembly techniques. By incorporating the ceramic feedthrough disc 40 as part of the vacuum chamber wall, several other advantages are derived. First, the structure of disc 40 insures the vacuum integrity of the assembly by eliminating straight through pin connection. Second, if necessary, a cross over assembly may be provided by appropriate arrangement of tracks 67 and vias 66 which allow reordering of the configuration of pin connectors 62 from the tape cable 36 to a desired pattern of pin connectors 64 on the feedthrough assembly 40. This allows mating with external device connectors in a predetermined pattern of electrical connections. Finally, this reduces the total part count of the system by incorporating the pin connector in the horizontal plane of vacuum vessel 15. A single or segmented bias resistor board 42 may be inserted above disc 40 to provide a tailored electrical resistance in each detector element s circuit, together with grounds as required. External connectors not shown are mounted to disc 40 above bias resistor board 42 via jackscrew posts 78. It should also be noted that pinch off tube 28 and getter feedthrough 30 can be positioned elsewhere on vessel 15 to increase accessibility if required.
