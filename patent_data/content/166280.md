# Method for producing glass containers with reduced strain.

## Abstract
A method is provided for the manufacture of glass con tainers 10 of the type having a sidewall 12 and having a bot tom 16 that is thicker than the sidewall 12 . The method comprises a step in which a centered portion 44 of the bot tom 16 is cooled subsequent to the molding step. Cooling the centered portion 44 is effective to develop a reverse strain in the transition portion 42a of the sidewall 12 that is proximal to the bottom 16 . This reverse strain corrects the strain that is induced by unequal cooling of a relatively thin sidewall 12 and a relatively thick bottom 16 and results in a reduction of annealing time.
