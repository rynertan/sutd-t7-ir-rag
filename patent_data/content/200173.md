## Description
This application relates to The present invention relates to a magnetic bubble memory module and particularly to a mag netic bubble memory module which is suitable for thinning and miniaturizing its body lowering con sumption and ameliorating efficiency of composi tion. The magnetic bubble memory module realized in these years has the structure wherein an x coil and a Y coil for generating a revolving magnetic field which are respectively composed of square solenoid coils having non symmetric structures with each other are respectively inserted to E like substrates made of ceramic, synthetic resin or the like mount ing a magnetic bubble memory chip and are arranged at a right angle with eadh other. The X coil and the Y coil must be provided around not only a mag netic bubble memory chip but also a substrate which is far larger than the chip. Thus, The length from one end of each coil to the other end thereof is made longer and thus the driving voltage and the power consumption are made larger. Furter, the X coil and the Y coil supply a uniform and stable in plane revolving magnetic field to the magnetic bubble memory chips and thus respectively require a uniform inductor balance. Thus, these coil forms are respectively required to have non symmetric structures which are different from each other and to have large structures. Moreover, these coils respectively have the structure wherein there are arranged on the outside surfaces of the X coil and the Y coil a pair of permanent magnet plates for supplying vertial bias magnetic fields to each mag netic bubble memory chip and the plates for homog enizing their magnetic fields and these peripheral portions are covered with resin molds. Accordingly, their lamination thicknesses in the vertical direc tion are made larger and this enlargment has been made to be an obstracle to requirements for thinning and miniaturizing a magnetic bubble memory module.

Fig. 3 is a perspective view as to assembling for describing the order of pile assembling respec tive components composing the above stated magnetic bubble memory module. The same characters with the above stated description show the same components. In this Figure, at first, the substrate assembly BND assembled by loading two chips CHI on the sub strate FPC having connecting sections for input and output wirings projected at 4 corners and a chip loading section at the central position is disposed in an outer case RFSa on which insulating sheets 36 are disposed by attaching.

These are accomodated in the outer shield case SHIa and further the inner shield case SHIb is incorporated therewith. Next, the side contact portion between the outer shield case SHIa and the inner shield case is electrically connected. Then, the outer connection terminal connecting sections of said substrate FPC projected at the four corners of the shield case SHI are bent to the rear surfaces of the inner shield case SHIa as shown in Fig. 4B and are incorporated so as to have a fixed form. A terminal fixing plate TEF loaded with contact pads CNP at respective openings is disposed in contact with respective outer connection terminals covered by soldering or the like respec tively provided at said terminal connecting sections and respective outer connection terminals and the contact pads CNP are electrically connected with each other by means of soldering or the like.

Next, the structure of the above stated respec tive components are described. Fig. 4 shows the substrate FPC. Fig. 4A is a plan view showing it. Fig. 4B is a plan view show ing the connecting sections of the outer connection terminals projected at 4 corners, which are bent to the assembly. Fig. 4C is an enlarged sectional view taken on the line 4C 4C in Fig. 4A. Fig. 4D is an enlarged sectional view taken on the line 4D 4D in Fig. 4A. In these drawings, the substrate FPC includes a rectangular chip loading section 1 at the central part, sections to be bent 2 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d whose widths are small at the four corners and rectangular outer connection terminal connecting sections hereinafter, referred as to a connecting section 3 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d , which are integrally formed so as to wholly have an almost windmill like form. Further, on the facing sides of this chip loading section 1, there are provided double frame structure of square openings 4 4a, 4b to be loaded with the two chips CHI stated after and to be con nected with the terminal sections thereof and three holes 5 5a, 5b, 5c for positioning and there is provided a projection 6 for positioning at the tip of the connecting section 3C. Further, in this substrate FPC, the patterns of lead wires 9a, circular outer terminals 9b, ellip soidal coil lead connecting terminals 9c, notes 9d, index marks 9e and the like as shown in Fig. 4A are formed by means of forming a copper thin film on a base film 7 made of a polyimide resin film with, for example, about 50 µm of thickness on which on epoxy system adhesive agent is coated as shown in Fig. 4C and then accomplishing etching of these films so as to form a required pattern. Further, a trans parent or semi transparent cover film 10 is attached and disposed on the upper surface of these films on which the adhesive agent 8 consisting of the same components with the above stated agent is coated. And, in the opening 4 of this substrate FPC, an opening is formed on the base film 7 to be a chip CHI loading side not shown in the drawings to tightly restricted dimensional tolerance. Then, an opening in relatively large dimensions is formed on an upper surface side cover film 10. Further, the lead wires 9a are exposed between the base film 7 and the cover film 10 and on the surface of these lead wires 9a, there is formed a tinning layer 11. Con sequently, the opening form has a two layered struc ture and at once a double frame structure. On the other hand, in the connecting section 3, as shown in Fig. 4D, circular openings 12 are formed on the portions corresponding with said circular outer terminals 9b of the cover film 10 and elliptical outer terminals 9c not shown in the drawings and a soldering layer 13 by planting, dipping or the like is formed on the copper thin film patters of the outer terminals 9b and 9c exposed from the opening 12. And, respective outer terminals 9b and 9c pro vided at these connecting sections 3 are connected to respective lead wires 9a continuously formed on the chip loading section 1, respective connecting sections 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d and respective bending sec tions 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d. These lead wires 9a are ag gregated as respective blocks of respective connect ing sections 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d at a part of respective opening edges of respective openings 4a, 4b and these tips of respective blocks are exposed in re spective openings 4a, 4b. Namely, as shown in Fig. 4A, the lead wire 9a of the connecting section 3a is disposed at the left upper part of the opening 4a. The lead wire 9a of the connecting section 3b is disposed at the left lower part of the opening 4b. The lead wires 9a of the connecting section 3c are disposed at the right upper part of the open ing 4a. The lead wires 9a of the connecting section 3d are disposed at the right lower part of the open ing 4b. And this substrate FPC is constructed so as to easily discriminate those patterns by looking through the cover film 10, because, in the step stated after, respective connecting sections 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d are combined for engagement, as shown in Fig. 4B by bending respective sections to be bent 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d and respective outer terminals 9b, 9c on which the soldering layer 13 is formed are exposed to the surface and further, the surfaces of the lead wires 9a, the note 9d and the index mark 9e are covered by the cover film 10. Under this construction, the substrate FPC employs a polyimide resin film and is constructed to have a windmill like form providing respective connecting sections 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d through respec tive sections to be bent 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d at the four corners of the chip loading section 1. By construct ing the outer terminal sections by bending and engag ing these connecting sections 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d with one another, the chip loading section 1 and the connecting sections are made to have two layered wiring structures. Thus, without diminishing the area of the connecting sections 3, the area of the chip loading section 1 is made larger and at once the outer terminal section can be made to have plural terminals. Accordingly, the overall form can be minimized. Further, under the above stated construction, it is possible to greatly shorten the lead wires 9a from respective outer terminals 9b to respective openings 4a, 4b of the chip loading section 1. Thus, the influence caused by an external noise and the like can be greatly diminished. It means that it is possible to input and output a signal with a high S N ratio. Further, by providing the projection 6 at one end of the connecting section 3c and at once the index mark 9e at this projection 6, this index mark can facilitate the discriminations for indicating the central part of the substrate in case of bending and engaging these connecting sec tions, positioning in case of combining the substrate with the cases RFS and SHI refer to Fig. 2 , dis tinguishing a king of the lead wires 9a from another or indicating a production model or the like. Con sequently, it is possible to rationalize assembling, controlling a substrate and the like. Further, by providing the openings 5a, 5b, 5c at both ends of the chip loading section 1 of the substrate FPC, it is made to be easy to distinguish the right of the substrate FPC from the left thereof, position the chip CHI and the like and similarly it is pos sible to rationalize assembling efficiency. Fig. 5 is a plan view showing the construction wherein the chip CHI is loaded on the above stated substrate FPC. In this figure, two chips CHI are loaded on the chip loading section 1 of the substrate FPC as disposing them between the openings 4a, 4b in parallel so as to complete the substrate assembly BND. One of the chips is constructed by inte grating two blocks of 1 Mbit as shown in an enlarged plan view of Fig. 6. Thus, two chips CHI have four blocks, that is, totally compose a 4 M bits chip. Further, in one block of the chip CHI shown in Fig. 6, a large line shows a conductor pattern and a thin line shows a chevron pattern propagation path. The chip CHI xhown in Fig. 5 is loaded by means of the lead bonding using Au Sn eutectic crystal caused by a pressure melding method as disposing a gold bump 15 between respective bonding pads 14 provided by gold planting at the end of the chip CHI and the wiring leads 9a on which the tinning layer 11 is formed in the opening 4 of the substrate FPC as respectively shown in enlarged sectional views of Figs. 7A and 7B. According to the above stated construction, it is possible to fixedly support the chip CHI by con necting the lead wires 9a in the openings 4a, 4b of the substrate FPC with the bonding pads 14 of the chip CHI by means of the lead bonding using Au Sn eutectic crystal. Accordingly, it is possible to greatly ameliorate strength for connection and thin the construction. Further, the surface of the chip CHI is covered by the chip loading section 1 of the substrate FPC. Thus, the surface of the chip CHI is protected and at once it is possible to ameliorate handling efficiency and to hold mechanical strength of the substrate FPC. Moreover, according to the above stated construction, since each chip CHI con sists of two blocks and two chips CHI are composed of 4 blocks, respective blocks can be distributively connected to respective connecting sections 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d which are the closes to respective blocks and thus the symmetric position of the chips CHI can be obtained so as to extremely facilitate a test, a check and the like. Further, since the substrate FPC provides four connecting sections, 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, it is possible to give and receive an input and an output signals having least noise by means of separating wirings for magnetic bubble detectors DET, map loops of each chip CHI and the like from the other wiring functions and aggregating them at one connecting section refer to Fig. 6 and selectively disposing this connecting section at the location which is far away from a noise generating source. Fig. 8 shows the magnetic circuit PFC. Fig. 8A is a perspective view. Fig. 8B is a plan view showing the driving magnetic circuit. In these drawings, in the magnetic circuit PFC, a coil COI composed of four coils 20a, 20b, 20c and 20d by providing wirings in the arrow direction are pro vided on the parallel sides facing to each other of the picture frame type of core COR made of soft magnetic materials and a X coil 22a is composed by accomplishing series winding of the coils 20a and 20b on the sides facing to each other by way of a contact 21b and a Y coil 22b is composed by accomplishing series winding of the coils 20c and 20b by way of a contact 21a. And, by supplying the X coil 22b and the Y coil 22b with currents Ix and Iy whose phase difference is 90 for example, triangular wave current , as shown in Fig. 8B, leak age magentic fields Hx and Hy are respectively gen erated in the x axial direction and in the y axial direction so as to supply the above stated two chips CHI with them as a revolving magnetic field. Further, the magnetic circuit PFC constructed as stated above is completed by the step of, as shown in a perspective view of Fig. 9, providing windings in a rectangular parallelepiped like magnetic core 23 made of one soft magnetic material and a tap 24 at each plural blocks, forming a pair of coils, for example, a pair of X coils 22a composed of the coils 20a, 20b, by accomplishing series winding and pro viding a wider groove 25 and a less wide groove 26 respectively having fixed widths between respective coils 20a and 20b by means of cutting work, after wards, engaging the wider grooves 25 divided into two parts at the center of this less wide groove 26 with each other rectangularly and attaching them so as to buildup a picture frame type of core as shown ia Fig. 8. Further, reversely, the rectangular parallelepiped core 23 forming the above stated wider groove 25 and less wide groove 26 in advance can provide the coil 20a and the coil 20b by way of the tap 24 so as to form a pair of X coils 22a. Moreover, the above stated pair of Y coils 22b can be formed quite similarly with the X coils. Under the construction stated above, since the rectangular parallelepiped core 23 provides the coils 20a, 20b as providing the tap in the series direction, in case of completing the construction by assembling as shown in Fig. 8, there is no need to connect lines contact as crossing them with each other and thus it is possible to simplify winding. According to the construction stated above, since the X coil 22a and the Y coil 22b are made to be symmetric, coarse coupling is brought about. Thus, it is possible to ameliorate an inductance balance and to prevent magnetic interference among magnetic materials in relation to a leakage magmetic field. Moreover, this magnetic circuit PFC is made to have a picture frame type of structure and thus is not disposed on the upper or the lower surface of the chip CHI. Thus, the thickness in the lamina tion direction is made smaller and thus the thinning of the circuit can be realized. Fig. 10 shows the inner case RFSb. Fig. 10A is a plan view. Fig. 10B is a sectional view taken on the line10B 10B of Fig. 10A. In the drawings, the inner case RFSb is built up of a frame type of drawn section 30 providing a concave portion at its center, bent sections 31 made by bending a pair of opposite side edges to each other upwardly about 90 and cut away sections 32 made by cutting respec tive four corners in the slanting direction. This case RSFb is formed by press working of excellent conducting materials, for example, an oxygen free copper plate. In this case, the drawn section 30 and the bent sections 31 have a function of ame liorating mechanical strength of this inner case RFSb in the spiral direction and at once to suitably restrict outer length L in the vertical and trans versial directions between each opposite bent sec tions 31 to each other. Further, the drawn section 30 can suitably arrange the distance between the magnet body BIMb disposed at the outer surface sides of this case RFSb and the chip CHI disposed at the inner surface side thereof. Besides, the cut away sections 32 provided at the four corners form the drawing section of respective sections 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d to be bent of the substrate FPC disposed in this case RFSb. According to the construction described above, it is possible to form the inner case RFSb by the press work. Thus, it can be manufactured in highly accurate dimensions and at low cost. Further, for the inner case RFSb, oxygen free copper is employed but it is possible to employ copper, silver, or gold plate or the plate made by planting the alloy plate of these materials. Fig. 11 shows the outer case RFSa corresponding with the above stated inner case RFSb. Fig 11A is a plan view. Fig. 11B is a sectional view taken on the line 11B 11B. In the drawings, this outer case RFSa is produced by using the same materials and manufacturing method with the above stated inner case RFSb. It is comprised of a frame type of drawing section 33 providing a concave portion at its center, bent sections 34 made by bending two pairs of opposite side edges upwardly about 90 and cut away sections 35 made by cutting away respec tive four corners in the slanting direction, simi larly with the above stated case. In this case, two pairs of bent sections 34 are formed to have the almost same inside length between the opposite bent sections with the outside length L between the corresponding opposite bent sections of said inner case RFSb and higher height H than those of said inner case RFSb. Moreover, these drawn section 33 and cut away sections 35 are formed to have the almost same dimensions with those of said inner case RFSb. The outer case RFSa and the inner case RFSb as constructed above are assembled to be an integrated case RFS by means of inserting the inner case RFSb into the outer case RFSa and connecting them with each other to make the inner case RFSb be in contact with the outer surfaces of the bent sections 31 of the outer case RFSa, as shown in Fig. 12A which is the plan view of the case RFS and in Fig. 12B which is the sectional view taken on the line 12B 12B of Fig. 12A. Fig. 13 is a sectional view showing the above stated case RFS and the substrate assembly BND accomodated and disposed in said case. In this Figure, on the bottom of the outer case RFSa, for example, about 0.1 mm of thickness of polyimid film 36 is disposeed and attached as an electrically insulating sheet. The substrate assembly BND and the magnetic circuit PFC are respectively disposed on this film 36 and the peripheral portion thereof. Further, an epoxy system adhesive agent 37 is coated on the upper surface of the substrate assembly BND and then, in the upper part of them, the inner case RFSb is inserted, disposed and joined. In this instance, the inner surfaces of the bent sections 34 of this outer case RFSa are mechanically and electrically jointed with the outer surfaces of the bent sections 31 of the inner case RFSb at the por tions marked by X by means of metal flowing, solder ing or the like. Silicon resin SIR fills in the with the outer surfaces of the bent sections 31 of the outer case RFSa, as shown in Fig. 12A which is the plan view of the case RFS and in Fig. 12B which is the sectional view taken on the line 12B 12B of Fig. 12A. Fig. 13 is a sectional view showing the above stated case RFS and the substrate assembly BND accomodated and disposed in said case. In this Figure, on the bottom of the outer case RFSa, for example, about 0.1 mm of thickness of polyimid film 36 is disposeed and attached as an electrically insulating sheet. The substrate assembly BND and the magnetic circuit PFC are respectively disposed on this film 36 and the peripheral portion thereof. Further, an epoxy system adhesive agent 37 is coated on the upper surface of the substrate assembly BND and then, in the upper part of them, the inner case RFSb is inserted, disposed and joined. In this instance, the inner surfaces of the bent sections 34 of this outer case RFSa are mechanically and electrically jointed with the outer surfaces of the bent sections 31 of the inner case RFSb at the por tions marked by X by means of metal flowing, solder ing or the like. Silicon resin SIR fills in the a packaging effect and assembling efficiency much. Moreover, since the volume covered by the outer case RFSa and the inner case RFSb is diminished, a VI product α volume can be reduced and thus it is possible to miniaturize the magnetic circuit PFC for generating a revolving magnetic circuit. Further, by reducing a gap between the opposite concave por tions by means of providing concave portions formed by the drawn sections 30, 33 on the outer case RFSa and the inner case RFSb, in the revolving mag netic field, only the vertical component to the level of the chip CHI Z component are made close to zero and thus only the horizontal componemt is left. Accordingly, it is possible to ameliorate uniformity of the magnetic field. Then, since the magnetic circuit PFC and the case RFS have a sym metric structure in relation to a vertical axis to the element surface of the chip CHI, it is pos sible to ameliorate the uniformity thereof much more. Fig. 14 shows the magnet body BIM. Fig. 14A is a plan view thereof. Fig. 14B is a side view thereof. Fig. 14C is an elevational view thereof. In these drawings, the magnet body BIM is formed by piling up an inclined plate INN made of non magnetic materials such as copper and having one predetermined inclined surface of the opposite sur faces, a plate HOM for homogenizing a magnetic field whose thickness is uniform and to be disposed at the inclined surface side of this inclined plate INN, a magnet plate MAG whose thickness is uniform and to be disposed at the upper surface side of this plate for homogenizing a magnetic field HOM and an inclined plate INM havong an inclined surface and to be disposed at the upper surface side of this magnet body MAG and then integrating them by means of an epoxy system adhesive agent. Thus, it is formed so sa to make the overall thickness of piling plates uniform. And, a uniform bias magnetic field can be radiated over the almost overall sur faces from the upper and the lower surfaces of this magnet body BIM. Fig. 15 shows a bias coil BIC. Fig. 15A is a perspective view thereof. Fig. 15B is a sectional view taken on the line 15B 15B of Fig. 15A. In the drawings, the bias coil BIC is formed to be a pciture frame type having a predetermined value by means of providing windings in order 40 on which, for example, thermosetting resin is coated as an insulated member so as to be disposed as 5 X 4 windings in section and to make the overall form picture frame like and then pressure melding the windings by thermal deposition and cooling it. In this case, the bias coil is formed by thermal depositing thermosetting resin coated on the outer surfaces of respective windings 40 and loading respec tive windings 40 and loading respective windings 40 by pressure welding. Then, by cooling it, respective windings 40 are hardened in the united state of wind ings and thus having a predetermined picture frame. Fig. 16 is a sectional view showing the case RFS desoribed in Fig. 13, the above stated magnet body BIM and bias coil BIC incorporated in the case. In this Figure, an upper magnet body BIMa and a lower magnet body BINb are respectively disposed and jointed on the upper and the lower surfaces of the case RFS assembly accomodated in the substrate assembly BND and the magnetic circuit PFC. And, the bias coil BIC is accomodated and disposed in a picture frame groove section formed by being sur rounded by the peripheral portion of this upper magnet body BIMa and the bent sections of the inner case RFSb. In this instance, the upper magnet body BIMa and the lower magnet body BIMb are formed by means of the same materials and in the same dimen sions with each other. These magnet bodys BIMa and BIMb at their inclined plate INN sides are respec tively disposed closely in a concave portion sur rounded by the drawn section 30 of the inner case RFSb and a concave portion surrounded by the drawn section 33 of the outer case RFSa. According to the construction described above, it is possible to dispose a pair of magnet bodys BIMa and BIMb in the concave portions formed at both surfaces of the central part of the case RFS assembly and further provide the bias coil BIC in the picture frame groove formed in the peripheral section of those magnet bodys. Thus, the overall thickness of each component in the laminating direction is made smaller and the miniaturizing and thinning of the construction can be realized. Further, since the picture frame space groove is formed by the outer case RFSa and the peripheral portion of the upper magnet body BIMb, it is possible to dispose the above stated bias coil BIC in this space groove, to newly provide a bias coil and further to form a bias coil by accomplishing windings as using the groove as a coil bobbin. Fig. 17 shows an outer shield case SHIa. Fig. 17A is a plan view thereof. Fig. 17B is a sectional view taken on the line 17B 17B of Fig. 17A. In the drawings, the outer shield case SHIa is comprised of a flat section 51, bent sections 52 made by bending two pairs of opposite side edges of the flat section 51 upwardly about 90 , concave portion 53 made by cutting away part of the central parts of these bent sections 53 and cut away sections 54 made by cutting respective four corners of these bent sections in the slanting direction. This outer shield case SHIa has high Permeability and saturated flux density and it should be preferably formed by press working materials with high thermal conductivity, for example, a Permalloy plate. Fig. 18 shows an inner shield case SHIb cor responding with the above stated outer shield case SHIa. Fig. 18A is a plan view thereof. Fig. 18B is a sectional view taken on the line 18B 18B of Fig. 18A. In these drawings, this inner shield case SHIb is formed by the same materials and manufactur ing method with the outer shield case SHIa stated above. It is comprised of, similarly with the above, a flat section 55, sections 56 made by bending two pairs of opposite side ends upwardly about 90 , con cave portions 57 made by cutting away part of the central parts of these bent sections 57 and cut away sections 58 made by cutting respective corners or these bent sections. In this instance, each opposite bent sections 56 have the almost same outside length betweeen them with the inside length L4 between each opposite bent sections 52 of the above stated outer shield case SHIa and the height H of the inner shield case SHIb is lower than that of the outer shield case SHIa. Fig. 19A is a plan view showing the outer shield case SHIa and the inner shield case SHIb constructed above. Fig. 19B is a sectional view taken on the line 19B 19B. The shield case SHI is integrally built up by means of inserting the inner shield case SHIb in the outer shield case SHIa and accomplishing spot welding or solder welding in relation to the concave portion 59 formed by the concave portion 53 of the outer shield case SHIa and the concave por tion 57 of the inner shield case SHIa so as to mag netically and mechanically fix both shield cases with each other. In the construction described above, by arranging the bent sections 52 of the outer shield case SHIa and the bent sections 56 of the inner shield case SHIb in the lateral direction, that is, the direction crossed to the laminating direction but in the laminating direction, it is possible to make the dimensions in the lateral direc tion smaller and thus to miniaturize the construction and highly integrate components. Fig. 20 is a sectional view showing the above stated shield case SHI assembly, the case RFS assem bly incorporating the substrate assembly BND and the magnetic circuit PFC therein as described in Fig. 16 and the assembly consisting of a pair of magnet body BIMa and BIMb and the bias coil BIC respectively incorporated in said shield case SHI assembly. In this Figure, in the inside of the outer shield case SHIa, the upper magnet body BIMa at the bottom to the center, the bias coil BIC at the peripheral portion, the case RFS assembly incorporating the substrate assembly BND, the mag netic circuit PFC and the like therein , the lower magnet body BIMb are sequentially laminated and disposed and then the inner shield case SHIb is inserted to the outer shield case. Both shield cases are sealed with each other by means of welding the concave portion 59 refer to Fig. 19 formed by the concave portion 53 of the outer shield case SHIa and the concave portion 59 of the inner shield case SHIb stated above. In this case, if grease or the like is made to fill in this shield case SHI, the components staying therein are substantially and closely attached with one another and the heat generated in this case RFS can be dissipated to the outside through this shield case SHI. Further, it is possible to ameliorate a dissipating effect by employing the structure wherein the case RFS and the shield case SHI are in contact with each other by means of a press fitting system. Under the construction stated above, by laminat ing in order the case RFS assembly on the bottom of the outer shield case SHIa as confronting these bent sections 31, 34 with each other, respective components laminated between the outer shield case SHIa and the inner shield case SHIb are closely disposed. Thus, it is possible to miniaturize and thin the shield case and at once to obtain a dis sipating effect. Fig. 21 shows a packaging case PKG. Fig. 21A is a plan view thereof. Fig. 21B is a sectional view taken on the line 21B 21B.

And, on the surface of this resin plate 60 except its peripheral portion, a plurality of through holes 61 are provided in matrix arrange ment with a predetermined interval in the breadth and length direction. At the corner portion of the through hole block, a non through hole 62 which is rotationally symmetric and has a concave in section is provided.

These openings 64 all have depth of about 60 of the plate thick ness and are respectively connected with the through holes 61 as having steps on the way of connection. Further, at the rear side of this resin plate 60, there is formed along the peripheral portion a groove 65 which has the almost same depth with the depth of said openings, different width in the horizontal direction therefrom and a concave state in section. The inside of this groove 65 serves as the passage section and the connection section of the coil COI windings and the bias coil BIC windings stated above, Further, the corner portions of this resin plate 60 are not formed as concave forms. They have a predetermined plate thickness and serve as contact surfaces to the inner side surfaces of the above stated packaging case PKG. As stated above, the rear side of the resin plate 60 is formed to have a two stepped structure which, namely, has two thicknesses. Fig. 23 shows a contact pad CNP. Fig. 23A is a plan view thereof. Fig. 23B is a sectional view thereof. In these drawings, the contact pad CNP is formed by means of accomplishing pressing work of good conducting materials, for example, a copper plate whose thickness is about 0.5 mm to punch out a piece member 70 and then forming a nickel planting layer 71 and a gold planting layer 72 on the surface of the piece member 70. Of respective components constructed as de scribed above, at first, the shield case assembly described in Fig. 20 is inserted to the packaging case PKG stated above. Under this state, respec tive connecting sections, 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d of said substrate assembly BND refer to Fig. 4A are pro jected from the four corners of this packaging case PKG as bent at about 90 degrees on the basis of respective sections to be bent 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d. Next, respective components are fixedly disposed in this packaging case PKG by accomplishing a resin molding to the four corners of this packaging case PKG by means of a potting method. And, these connecting sections 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d are respectively bent about 90 degrees by the corresponding sections to be bent 2a, 2b, 2c, 2b and then are engaged on the outer surface of the inner shield case SHIb shrough an adhesive agent as shown in Fig. 4B. Then, the contact pads CNP are loaded in respective openings provided on the rear side of said terminal fixing plate TEF or the sides of the contact pad CNP are made solid by means of an adhesive agent and then the treated contact pads CNP are inserted in the packaging case PKG so as to be disposed in contact with respective connecting sections 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d. In this instance, the arrangement pitch of respec tive external terminals 9b provided on respective connecting sections, 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d corresponds with the arrangement pitch for respective contact pads CNP. Thus, resepctive external terminals 9b are electrically in contact with the contact pads CNP. Next, a heated thing whose tip is slender or some thing like that is inserted to each through holes 61 from the rear side of the disposed terminal fixing plate TEF so as to attach the contact pads CNP with the external terminals by pressure welding. Conse quently, respective external terminals 9b are electricaly connected with the corresponding contact pads CNP and at once the terminal fixing plate TEF is mechanically fixed to the contact pads so as to complete the magnetic bubble memory module as shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 24 is a sectional view showing the portion around the bonding pad PAD of the magnetic bubble chip CHI stated above. In this Figure, GGG gado linium gallium garnet denotes a substrate. LPE denotes a bubble magnetic film formed by means of a liquid phase epitaxial growth method. One example of its composite is referred in the following Table 1. INO denotes an ion implanted layer formed on a LPE film surface for restraining hard bubbles. SP1 denotes a first spacer which serves to form, for example, SiO₂ whose thickness is 3000Å by means of a gaseous phase chemical reaction. CON 1 and CON 2 denote two conducting layers and has a function of controlling generation of bubbles, duplication division thereof and exchanging thereof as stated above. A lower first conducting layer CON 1 and an upper second conducting layer CON 2 are respec tively made of materials such as Mo and those such as Au. SP2 and SP3 respectively denote layer insulating films a second and a third spacers made of polyimide resin or the like for performing electrical insulation between the conducting layers CON and a transfer pattern layer P made of Permalloy or the like formed thereon. PAS denotes a passiva topn film formed out of a Sio₂ film or the like formed by means of a gaseous phase reaction method. PAD denotes a bonding pad of the chip CHI, where a fine connector wire such as a Aℓ wire or the like is bonded by means of a pressure welding method or a supersonic method. In this bonding pad PAD, a lower first layer PAD 1, a middle second layer PAD 2 and an upper third layer PAD 3 are respectively formed out of materials such as Cr, those such as Au and those such as an Au planting layer. It is possible to form the second and the third layers PAD 2 and PAD 3 out of the materials such as Cr, Cu or the like. P denotes the layer utilized as a transfer path of bubbles, a dividing, a generating, an ex changing and a seraching sections of bubbles and a guardrail section. In the description stated after, it is described as a transfer pattern layer for convenience sake. As an example shown in Fig. 24, this transfer pattern layer P employs Fe Ni as a lower layer P1 and an upper layer P2, but it is possible to exchange both materials with each other as stated before. Hereinafter, the example in which a multi layered transfer pattern layer is applied for respec tive sections of the chip CHI with referenoe to the plan views of Fig. 25 and the drawings thereafter. In these plan views, each layer of the transfer pattern layer 18 formed by a self alignment and thus attention should be payed to the layers expressed by the same contour therewith. Fig. 25 shows a D section of a bubble detector. MEM denotes a main magnetic resistance element for detecing the exis tence of bubbles by means of variation of a resistance value provided in case of passing the bubbles extended like a band in the lateral direction through the element. MED denotes a dummy magnetic resistance element having the same pattern form with those of the main magnetic resistance element and is utilized for detecting noise components brought about by the influence of a revolving magnetic field and the like. At the upper side of the main magnetic resistance element MEM, there are formed scores of steps of bubble stretchers ST for transferring the bubbles downwardly as stretched in the lateral direction though only the two steps thereof are shown in the drawing. Further, PR denotes the transfer direction of bubbles. ER denotes a bubble eraser and serves to erase bubbles when they attain to the conducting layer CND. The guardrail GR consisting of pattern blocks lining up in three files is provided around this detector D and between the dummy and the main detections and serves to get the unnecessary bubbles generated in the inside of the guardrail GR out of the guardrail and to prevent entering the unnecessary bubbles generated in the outside of the guardrail GR into the inside thereof. Further, in the plan pattern views after Fig. 25, the patterns except the conducting layer CND pattern show the transfer pattern layer P described in Fig. 24. In Fig. 25, a signal to noise ratio S N ratio is ameliorated by means of forming the magnetic resistance elements MEM and MED by a multilayered magnetic layer. For example, in case of utilizing a three layered Permalloy layer layinga SiO₂ film as a transfer pattern between respective layers, it is possible to ameliorate a S N ratio over doubly in comparison with the case of using a Permalloy single layer as shown in the following Table 2. Further, the efficiency of the guardrail GR can be improved because of heightening a discharging factor for unnecessary bubbles by means of reducing retentiveness Hc. Fig. 26 shows a magnetic bubble generator GEN. The current generated in the magnetic bubbles can be made smaller by making the transfer pattern layer P multilayered and thus it is made possible to lengthen the life of the conducting layer CND of the magnetic bubble generator. Accordingly, the driving circuit for the conducting layer CND can employ a semiconductor element with a small current capacity value and thus its cost can be made lower. Fig. 27 shows a minor loop m composed of transfer patterns such as Pa Ph and the like, a write major line WML composed of the transfer patterns such as Pw₁ to Pw₃ and the like and a swap gate section composed of a hairpin conducting layer CND. In this Figure, P7 is the same with the transfer pattern P7 in the bubble generator GEN shown in Fig. 26. In other words, the bubbles generated in the bubble generator GEN are transferred to the write major line WML through the P1 to P7 transfer pathes. When the swap conducting layer CND is energized, the magnetic bubbles in the transfer pattern Pd of the minor loops ml are transferred through the transfer patterns Pℓ and Pm to the transfer pattern Pw3 of the major line WML and the magnetic bubbles from the major line PW1 are transferred through the transfer patterns Pk, Pj and Pi to the transfer pattern Pe of the minor loop in order to accomplish an exchange of bubbles, that is, informations with each other. Further, the swap gate is not provided in the minor loop md at the right end, because it is a dummy loop where magnetic bubbles are not injected for reducing a peripheral effect. As described above, it is possible to accomplish an exchange of magnetic bubbles with a small current value by means of making the transfer pattern layers Pi to Pm at the exchange location multilayered. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 28, similarly with the above, it is possible to accomplish the drive with a small current value by means of a replicator for magnetic bubbles, that is, a divider therefor. In this Figure, the magnetic bubbles are usually transferred on the route of Pn to Pg and Ps to Px. When the conducting layer CND is energized, the bubbles is divided at the location of the transfer pattern Pg and one divided magnetic bubble is trans ferred to a read major line RML by way of Py and P8 to P10. The magnet body MAG is disposed as about 2 degrees tilted in relation to the chip CHI. This is designed to apply a bias magnetic field Hb to the chip CHI in the direction a little shifted from the vertical. Thus, it is possible to generate a holding magnetic field Hdc for ameliorating a atart and a stop margins of the bubble transfer to raise about 6 Oe Fig. 29A . As shown in Fig. 29A, on account of the slant at a ϑ degres angle between the magnet body BIM and the chip CHI, the series magnetic field Hz is made to have a component Hdc on the xy plane. And magnitude of this in plane component Hdc is Hdc sinϑ and usually, the slanting angle ϑ is selected to be Hdc sinϑ 5 Oe 6 Oe . Further, the direction of this in plane component Hdc is slanted to coincide with the start and stop St Sp direction in the revolving magnetic field Hr x axis direction . This component Hdc on this xy plane is a well known magnetic field effectively served as the start and stop St Sp operation of the revolving magnetic field Hr and called as a holding field. Further, magnitude of the bias magnetic field Hb vertically functioned on the chip CHI plane is made to be Hz cosϑ. The above stated holding field Hdc always func tions on the xy plane of the chip CHI and thus the revolving magnetic field Hr functioning to said chip CHI is made eccentric as illustrated in Fig. 29B. In this drawing, Hr denotes a revolving magnetic field applied from the external. Hr denotes a revolving magnetic field functioning to the chip CHI. In this case, the revolving magnetic field Hr func tioning to the chip CHI is made to be a synthesis of the revolving magnetic field Hr applied from the external and the in plane component Hdc and the center O of the revolving magnetic field Hr is shifted in parallel by the in plane component Hdc in the start and stop St Sp direction, that is, x axis direction. Thus, as is obvious from the result of Fig. 29B, if the intensity of the revolving magnetic field Hr applied from the external is Hr , the intensity Hr of the revolving magnetic field effectively functioning to the chip CHI is variable in accordance with the phase of the revolving magnetic field Hr. Namely, Hr in the St Sp direction is made to be Hr Hdc , which is more intensified by the intensity Hdc of the holding field Hdc in comparison with Hr . Conversely, Hr in the opposite direction to the St Sp direction is made to be Hr Hdc , which is made weaker by Hdc in comparison with Hr . Lastly, a peripheral circuit of the chip CHI is described with reference to Fig. 30. RF denotes a circuit for generating a revolving magnetic field Hr by flowing the current whose phase difference is 90 degrees through the X and Y coils of the chip CHI. SA denotes a sense amplifier for sampling a minute bubble detecting signal from the magnetic resistance element of the chip CHI in accordance with a timing of the revolving magnetic field, sensing and ampli fying it. DR denotes a driving circuit for generating the bubbles in relation to the write in the magnetic bubble memory device MBM, flowing current through respective replicate functioning conductors in relation to swapping and reading in accordance with a predstermined timing and driving a bias coil BIC. The above stated circuits are synchronized by means of a timing generator TG so as to be operated in synchronization with a cycle and a phase angle of the revolving magnetic field Hr. Fig. 31 shows a revolving magnetic field distri bution characteristic of the above stated magnetic circuit PFC. It means that in this Figure, when the axis of abscissas shows the length in the x axis direction with O as the center of the magnetic circuit PFC shown in Fig. 8B and the axis of ordinates shows the revolving magnetic field intensity Hx in the x axis direction in case of establishing the revolving magnetic field intensity in the x axis direction Hx O, the revolving magnetic field distribution characteristic as shown in the curve I can be obtained. As is obvious from this Figure, it is possible to obtain almost uniform revolving magnetic field intensity Hx in the range of Xc Xc of the distance between the insides of the core COR sides facing to each other in the magnetic circuit PFC and 2 of uniformity of the magnetic field intensity in the range of Xe Xe of the effective area of the chip CHI the minimal area to which a revolving magnetic field is to be applied . Further, the curve II shown by a broken line denotes revolv ing magnetic field distribution characteristic. In the embodiment described above, there is described the example employing a flexible substrate FPC formed to be a windmill form. With regard to this substrate FPC, except this embodiment, various kinds of applications are brought about in accordance with the form of the outer connection terminal connecting section 3 and the way of taking out it from the corner sections of the case RFS for confin ing a revolving magnetic field. Fig. 32 shows the embodiment wherein two rectan gular connecting sections 3a, 3b are extended from the upper side of a chip loading section 1 in the right and the left directions and bent by the sections 2a, 2b. Further, Fig. 33 shows the embodiment wherein two Y like connecting sections 3a, 3b are extended in the diagonal line direction and are bent by the sections 2a, 2b. Fig. 34 shows the embodiment wherein there is employed a wholly rectangular substrate FPC providing connecting sections 3a, 3b on the right side and the left side and these sections are bent by the sections 2a, 2b. Fig. 35 shows the embodiment wherein four chips are loaded on a wholly cross shaped substrate FPC and of four connecting sections 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d provided at respective tips of the substrate, two pairs of opposits connecting sections are respec tively bent on the upper surface and the lower surface of the module. In Fig. 35, the connecting sections 3a, 3b are bent to the upper surface of the module by the sections 2a, 2b and the connecting sections 3c, 3d are bent to the lower surface of the module by the sections 2c, 2d and thus the substrate FPC has a three layered structure as a whole. Further, in the embodiments shown in Figs. 34 and 35, there is shown in the drawings the construction wherein respective sections to be bent are wholly drawn out of respective side surfaces of the case RFS for confining a revolving magnetic field in order to prevent complication of the drawings, but for the purpose of keeping uniformity of a magnetic field and reducing loss thereof, it is preferable to draw respective sections to be bent at the corners of the case RFS for enclosing a revolving magnetic field. Accordingly, a square hole should be provided at the root sections of respective sections to be bent and the bent sections 34 shown in Fig. 11 ahould be passed through these holes. As described above, according to the present invention, it is designed to dispose the magnetic bubble memory chip loaded with the flexible substrate in the space section of the revolving magnetic circuit consisting of a picture frame core and to lay the overall body for confining a revolving magnetic field within the case, the body being made of good conducting materials, and to electrically connect the peripheral portion of the overall body with the case. Thus, it is possible to obtain quite excellent effects that a highly uniform revolving magnetic field can be obtained by a small VI product because of reducing the space for generating a leakage magnetic field and the magnetic bubble memory module which is designed to lower power consumption, miniaturize and thin the overall form and ameliorate assembling efficiency can be obtained because of miniaturizing the case for confining a revolving magnetic field. In the next place, a series of embodiments shown in Fig. 1 thru Fig. 23 will be described in conjunction with Fig. 32 thru Fig. 45. Here, description about the configuration material, structure and method and the effect similar to those for Fig. 1 thru Fig. 23 are omitted. Fig. 32 shows a modified embodiment of a flexible substrate. The flexible substrate FPC2 differs from that shown in Fig. 4 in such points as follows This film 101 is cut along the single dot chain lines shown in the drawing, and unnecessary parts as the finished product are cut off. The substrate FPC2 has a copper foundation lead wire pattern which is formed by means of patterning with etching technique the copper film which is lined with epoxy system adhesive onto the base film composed of a polyimide resin film having the thickness of approsimately 50µm. On the copper foundation lead wire layer, a Ni plating layer and an Au plating layer are formed successively by the electroplating method, etc. This Au plating layer is provided for the purpose of preventing from the electrical migration of the copper layer or making the thermocompression bonding of the magnetic bubble memory chip CHI with the bonding pad easy. The Ni layer is used for the purpose of improving adherence between the copper layer and the Au layer. The lead wire patten 100 of each frame is connected at this stage by the frame shaped pattern provided along the periphery shown in the drawing and the estended portion 100e, but it is for electroplating. One one frame of the film substrate FPC2, the external connection parts 100c of lead wire 100 are concentrated in two directions as previously described. One of the reasons for the concentration in the left and right directions instead of upward and downward directions is to obtain compatibility with the 35mm film described above. Another reason is as follows. The memory chip CHI is face up bonded underneath the film substrate FPC2, but the substrate FPC2 and the chip CHI are inclined in left and right directions in the drawing as described later. Under the same bias condition as Fig. 2B, inclination toward the right is arranged such that the left side is high and the right side is low with the magnet body as the reference. Thus, the substrate FPC2 is not inclined in upward and downward directions. Therefore, when the film substrate and the chip CHI is electrically connected after bonding the chip CHI to a conductor case des cribed later, uniform force is applied to the whole connection parts on the lefthand side and uniform bonding can also be made in the similar manner on the righthand side in bonding the connection part 100c between the film substrate FPC2 and the chip with the pad of the chip CHI. The same applies to the connection between the film substrate FPC and the printed substrate described later. Fig. 33 shows the inner case RFS2b. Fig. 33A is a plan view, and Fig. 33B is a sectional view taken on the line 33B 33B of Fig. 33A. This case RFS2b is different from that shown in Fig. 10 in such points that the drawing section is omitted and the bottom plate thickness gets thicker as getting closer to the righthand side. As shown in Fig. 33B, the lower surface of the bottom plate is tapered lowering toward the right at an angle of 1.7 degree against the upper surface. As seen from Fig. 38B, a plate HOM for homogenizing a magnetic field and the magnetic body of a permanent magnet are provided on the upper surface and the chip CHI is arranged on the lower surface. In other words, the inclination of thickness is provided for the purpose of giving to the chip CHI a holding magnetic field Hdc due to the inclination between the magnetic body and the chip CHI. The inclined surface of the conductor case described above is formed by means of press work with about 300 tons inclined padding process . As other forming method, such inclined surface may be formed either by cutting or by tilting a roller during rolling process. Since the operation of bending the film substrate along the drawing section will no longer be performed due to omission of the drawing section as shown in Fig. 10, the stress applied to the film substrate is lightened. Furthermore, since an inclined surface is provided on the conductor case RFS2b itself, the in clined plates INM and INN shown in Fig. 14 4 plates in total are no longer required, thereby decreasing the number of components. The reduction in the number of components leads to reduction in material cost and assembly cost. Fig. 34 shows the outer case RFS2a. Fig. 34A is a plan view and Fig. 34B is a sectional view on the line 34B 34B. The difference of the outer case RFS2a from the inner case RFS2b exists in that it has a drawing section 133 for containing or fitting the magnetic core PFC. On the upper surface of the bottom plate of the outer case RFS2a, a tapered sur face lowering to the right which is similar to the lower surface of the bottom plate or the inner case RFS2b is provided. Fig. 35 shows the status of only the outer and inner cases RFS2a and RFS2b assembled together The chip CHI, the film substrate FPC2 and the magnetic core PFC are omitted in the drawing in the same way as Fig. 12 . Fig. 12A is a plan view and Fig. 12B is a sectional view taken on the line 35B 35B. Fig. 36 shows the status of the chip CHI, the flexible substrate FPC2, and the magnetic circuit PFC accommodated in the outer case RFS2a the status before covering up with the inner case RFS2b . Fig. 36A is a plan view and Fig. 36B is a sectional view taken on the line 36B 36B. The chip CHI is mounted on the substrate before being accommodated in the case RFS2a. When the surface of the flexible substrate FPC2 on which the lead wire 100 is located is called the front surface, the chip CHI is mounted on the back of the flexible substrate FPC2 keeping the main surface up face up , on which bonding pads, lead wires and the transport path are located. It is needless to say that connection is made at the lead wire part 100a of the substrate FPC2 and the pad area of the chip CHI, but both are bonded by means of thermocompression of the lead wire part 100a on the pad with toolings such as a capillary. After bonding, the film substrate 101 consisting of plurality of substrates FPC2 is separated into in dividual substrate FPC2, and unnecessary lead wire parts and reinforced area which were used in plating the peri phery are cut off as shown in Fig. 36A. The conductor case RFS2a is applied with adhesives such as epoxy system resin by a stamping method, where the back of the chip CHI which was bonded on the film substrate FPC2 is adhered. The relation at this time between the locations of the chip CHI and the case RFS2a can be determined precisely by means of the cut away section 135 of the case RFS2a and external connecting sections 102a thru 102d. If necessary, more fine position ing adjustment is feasible by using jigs, etc. Then, the magnetic circuit PFC is housed in the groove formed by the drawing section 133 of the case RFS2a and the outside wall 134. Under such status, potting with silicone resin REG2 is performed around the chip CHI. The selicon resin REG2 increases its fluidity by heating treatment and gets into between the back of the flexible substrate FPC2 and the main surface of the chip CHI by means of the capillary action, thereby protecting the chip CHI against adhesion of dust and permeation of moisture. The height of the case RFS2a at the drawing section 133 is determined so that the flexible substrate FPC2 will be flat all over the inside of the case as shown in Fig. 36B taking the thickness of the magnetic circuit FPC and the thickness of the chip CHI into con sideration. Thereafter, the case RFS2b is welded by the ultrasonic welding method at its surface contact part with the case RFS2a. Fig. 37 shows the magnet body BIM2. Fig. 37A is a plan vies, Fig. 37B is a side view and Fig. 37C is a sectional view taken on the line 37C 37C. The magnet body BIM 2 shown differs from that BIM shown in Fig. 14 in such a point that inclined plates INM and INN are omitted. Fig. 38 shows the status of the magnet body BIM2 shown in Fig. 37 and the bias coil BIC shown in Fig. 15 accommodated in the case assembly RFS2 described with reference to Fig. 36. Fig. 38A is a plan view and Fig. 38B is a sectional view taken on the line 38B 38B. The upper magnet body BIM2a and the bias coil BIC are mounted on the plate shape inner case RFS2b, and the lower magnet body BIM2b is mounted on a flat part surrounded by the drawing section 38 of the outer case RFS2a. Fig. 38 shows the status of the magnet body BIM2 shown in Fig. 37 and the bias coil BIC shown in Fig. 15 accommodated in the case assembly RFS2 described with reference to Fig. 36. Fig. 38A is a plan view and Fig. 38B is a sectional view taken on the line 38B 38B. The upper magnet body BIM2a and the bias coil BIC are mounted on the plate shape inner case RFS2b, and the lower magnet body BIM2b is mounted on a flat part surrounded by the drawing section 38 of the outer case RFS2a. As seen from Fig. 38B, the chip CHI and the mag netic circuit PFC are inclined in left and right directions with reference to a parallel surface formed by upper and lower magnet bodies BIM2a and BIM2b. Besides, the condition for arranging the magnetic circuit PFC and the chip CHI in parallel remains unchanged from those embodiments shown in Fig. 13 and Fig. 16, but the thickness of the chip CHI, the thickness of the magnetic circuit PFC and the height of the drawing section 38 of the outer case RFS2a are designed so that the uppermost end surface of the magnetic circuit PFC and the upper surface of the chip CHI are almost even with each other, thereby preventing from application of the stress to the flexible substrate FPC2. Fig. 39 shows the upper shield case SHI2a. Fig. 39A is a plan view, Fig. 39B is the right side view and Fig. 39C is the bottom side view. As seen from Fig. 39A, the plane figure of the upper shield case SHI2a is square in shape and is symmetrical for any axis of four center lines passing the same point not shown , horizontal, vertical, and going up and down at 45 toward the right. The cut away sections 154 at four cormers making a right angle with the 45 center lines are provided for the purpose of having lead wire portions 102a thru 102d pass through at the four corners of the film substrate FPC shown in Fig. 32. 151 denotes the plane section of the case, and 152 denotes the upright wall section. Protruded sections 152a thru 152d are provided at the center part of each side of the walls 152. The height of protruded sections 152a and 152c on left and right sides is to be h₂, and the height of protrusion itself h₂ h₁ is to be the same as the thickness t₀ of the lower shield case SHI2b shown in Fig. 40. Furthermore, the height of the protruded sections 152b and 152d on upper and lower sides is to be h₃, and the height of protrusion itself h₃ h₁ is to be slightly bigger than the thickness t₀ of the lower shield case SHI2b. For example, it is determined that h₁ 4.5, h₂ 5.0, h₃ 5.3 and t₀ 0.5 and arrangement is made so that the protruded sections 152b and 152d of upper and lower sides of the upper shield case SHI2a slightly h₃ h₁ t₀ 0.3 pro trude over the lower plane part of the lower shield case SHI2b when the upper and lower shield cases SHI2a and SHI2b are assembled, thereby making the position ing easy with the ceramic printed substrate shown in Fig. 42. The unit for each value is mm. Fig. 40 shows the lower shield case SHI2b. Fig. 40A is a plan view, and Fig. 40B is a lower side view. The plate shaped lower shield case SHI2b has concave portions corresponding to the thickness t₀ of the wall 152 of the upper shield case SHI2a on four side, left and right, and upper and lower, where protruded sections 152a thru 152d of the upper case are fitted. The length in longitudinal and horizontal directions L103 and L104 of each case shown in Fig. 39 and Fig. 40, respectively, are designed same, for example, at 22.4mm. The lower shield case SHI2b does not require bending process comparing with that SHIb shown in Fig. 18. This results in not only cost reduction but also small thickness of the finished device. Fig. 41 shows the magnetic shield cases SHI2a and SHI2b shown in Fig. 39 and Fig. 40 packaged therein with the intermediate assembly shown in Fig. 38. Fig. 41A is a plan view and Fig. 41B is a sectional view taken on the line 41B 41B. The assembly shown in Fig. 41 still includes terminals 109a, 109b, and extended portion of lead wires for plating that are not required for the final assembly, however, it is possible to perform the operation test and selection of acceptable products for the intermediate assembly at this stage, thereby reducing the average assembly cost per device. Besides, the continuity test and the short circuit test between the film substrate FPC2 and the chip CHI are performed after face up bonding previously described and at the stage when the conductor case RFS2, etc. has been assembled, respectively. The upper and lower shield cases RFS2a and RFS2b are welded together by the spot welding method or the laser welding method. Fig. 42 shows a substrate for electrically connecting the shield case assembly shown in Fig. 41 to the pin grid external connection terminal. Fig. 42A is a plan view, Fig. 42B is a sectional view taken on the line 42B 42B, and Fig. 42C is a bottom view. The ceramic substrate 201 provided with lead wires 205 thereon includes the upper thruhole connection terminals 206, the thruholes 207 and the lower thruhole connection terminals 208. The other end 205a of the lead wires 205 shows the portion where the outer lead portion 100c of the flexible substrate FPC2 is con nected. The external connection pins 204 arranged in grid shape are connected electrically with the upper terminals 206 through conductive layers formed in the thruholes 207. Among the lead wires 205, those that are a little thicker than others are for connecting X coil, Y coil and bias coil 2 terminals each of Ix,Iy and Ib . 202 denotes a ceramic plate, on which the lower shield case SHI2b is adhered with epoxy resin, etc. That is, this ceramic plate 202 fulfils the duties of an insulation plate which prevents from short circuit of the lead wire portion 205b by the lower shield case SHI2b which is to be positioned thereon. Furthermore, the ceramic plate 202 includes the concave portions 202b, 202d, where abovesaid protruded sections 152b, 152d of the upper shield case SHI2a are fitted in, thus also serving to the positioning in case of adherence of the shield case assembly. The ceramic substrate 201 and the ceramic plate 202 are put in layers under the condition of green ceramics and are sintered thereafter. 203 denotes a frame shaped sealing ring, which is adhered to the edge of the ceramic substrate 201 by silver brazing alloy material, etc., and it is arranged such that the packaging cap PKG2 described later is welded to the portion protruding outside from the substrate 201. For the material of the frame 203 and the grid pin 204, Fe Ni Co alloy popular name KOVAR which has the coefficient of thermal expansion close to ceramics is selected. On the portion of the ceramic substrate 201 where lead wires 205, terminals 206, 208, thruholes 207 and frames 203 are brazed, double metalized layers are formed. After two ceramic members 201, 202 are sintered, the grid pins 204 and the frame 203 are brazed to the ceramic substrate 201 with silver brazing alloy material. The double metalized layers have such function as to increase the adhesive strength. Under such status, Ni and Au layers are electroplated successively on the pin grid substrate TEF2, i.e., on the exposed double metalized layers and KOVAR material. The Ni layer is provided for the purpose of increasing the adhesive strength between the doubled layer and the Au layer. The pins 204 are composed of KOVAR material, but since they are Au plated, the solderability related to packaging on the printed substrate, etc. by users is improved. The Au plated layer at the end portion 205a of the lead wire 205 makes the thermocompression bonding with Au plated outer lead 100c of the film substrate FPC2 possible. The Au plated layer of the frame 203 is useful for hermetic encapsulation of the packaging cap PKG2 described later. On the back of the ceramic substrate 201, a double metalized layer, i.e. an Au plated layer is formed a little wider than the adhered surface between the frame 203 and the pin 203 as shown with contour lines 209, 208 and no gap is arranged to exist on the adhered boundary surface by silver brazing alloy, etc., which achieves hermetic encapsulation along with the use of ceramics material and the packaging cap PKG2 described later. Besides, Au plating layer is not formed at the area 205b of the lead wire 205 located underneath the ceramic plate 202. However, since the pitch between the lead wires is wider than the film sub strate FPC2 described previously, there is no problem of electric migration. Fig. 43 shows the status when the shield case assembly shown in Fig. 41 is packaged on the pin grid substrate TEF2 shown in Fig. 42. Fig. 43A is a plan view and Fig. 43B is a sectional view taken on the line 43B 43B. It has been described with reference to Fig. 42 how to form the assembly, so such description is omitted here. Fig. 44 shows an encapsulation cap. Fig. 44A is a plan view, and Fig. 44B is a sectional view taken on the line 44B 44B. The cap PKG2 made of KOVAR has two wall sections 221, 222, and the bending between two wall portions 221 and 222 is made so that the wall 222 almost contacts the upper shield case SHI2a as shown in Fig. 45 for the purpose of improving heat radiation capacity. The bottom part 223 is welded to a portion exposed from the ceramic substrate 201 of the frame 223 made of KOVAR by the resistance welding method, etc. Accordingly, the step difference between the exposed portion of the frame 223 and the side of the ceramic substrate 201 is useful for positioning in fitting the cap PKG2. how to form the assembly, so such description is omitted here. Fig. 44 shows an encapsulation cap. Fig. 44A is a plan view, and Fig. 44B is a sectional view taken on the line 44B 44B. The cap PKG2 made of KOVAR has two wall sections 221, 222, and the bending between two wall portions 221 and 222 is made so that the wall 222 almost contacts the upper shield case SHI2a as shown in Fig. 45 for the purpose of improving heat radiation capacity. The bottom part 223 is welded to a portion exposed from the ceramic substrate 201 of the frame 223 made of KOVAR by the resistance welding method, etc. Accordingly, the step difference between the exposed portion of the frame 223 and the side of the ceramic substrate 201 is useful for positioning in fitting the cap PKG2. Fig. 45 shows the finished structure of a series of modified embodiments described with reference to Fig. 32 thru Fig. 44, that is, the structure of the intermediate assembly shown in Fig. 43 encapsulated with the cap PKG2 shown in Fig. 44. Fig. 45A is a plan view, Fig. 45B is a sectional view taken on the line 45B 45B and Fig. 45C is a right side view. The modified embodiment 1 is superior in the function of protecting the substrate FPC in the conductive shield case RFS, compared with the first embodiment. This is true because the conductive shield case RFS of the modified embodiment 1 is flat at its surface abutting the substrate FPC so that no stress is exerted on the substrate FPC. In the first embodiment, since the conductive shield case RFS has a step at its peripheral edge portion for receiving the magnetic circuit FPC, the substrate FPC is mounted along the step and is hence normally subjected to a deforming force. This deformation of the substrate FPC of the first embodiment can be eliminated by making flat one of the outer and inner conductive shield cases RFSa, RFSb on which the substrate FPC is to be mounted. This is a modified embodiment illustrated in Fig. 46 in which the outer case RFSa is flat. In Figs. 46 and 13, like reference numerals designate similar parts. The modified embodiment 2 is different from the first embodiment of Fig. 13 in that the outer case RFSa, on which the substrate FPC is to be mounted, is flat at its substantially entire surface except bent sections 34 at four sides of the case RFSa. With the thus flat inner surface of the outer shield case RFSa which surface abuts the substrate FPC loading the chips CHI, it is possible to reduce a strain which is produced on the substrate FPC, especially at a lead bonding portion thereof. Although in the modified embodiment 2 the flat section is provided on the outer case RFSa, it should be noted that the inner surface of the inner caser RFSb may be flat if the substrate FPC is to be mounted on the inner case RFSb. In the modified embodiment 1, the holding magnetic field Hde to the chip CHI resulting from the inclination between the magnetic body BIM and the chip CHI is provided by the change in plate thickness of the shield case RFS. On the other hand, the holding magnetic field Hdc according to the first embodiment is given by inserting the inclined plate INN between the flat case RFS and the magnet MAG. Fig. 47 and 48 show modified embodiments 3 and 4, illustrating alternative ways of mutually inclining the chip CHI and the magnet MAG when providing the holding magnetic field Hde to the chip CHI. Figs. 47 and 48 are cross sectional views corresponding to Fig. 20 of the first embodiment, showing the parts upside down. Since the primary subject of the invention illustrated in Figs. 47 and 48 is the structures of the case RFS and the magnetic body BIM with respect to the chip CHI, the bias coil BIC and the substrate FPC, which are impertinent to the subject, are not illustrated in Figs. 47 and 48 for clarity. In Figs. 47, 48 and 20, like reference numerals designate similar parts. In Figs. 47 and 48, RFSa and RFSb designate the outer case and the inner case, respectively, within which assembly the core COR and the coil COI which constitute the magnetic circuit PFC, and the chip CHI loading the above described substrate FPC not shown here are mounted. SHIa and SHIb designate the outer shield case and the inner shield case, respectively. The magnetic body BIM, which is composed of the inclined plate INM, the magnetic plate MAG and the magnetic field homonizing plate HOM, is inserted between the shield case RFS and the shield case SHI. The case RFS according to the modified embodiments 3 and 4 is different from that of Fig. 20 in that inclination establishing portions 200a, 200b are formed such as by squeezing the case plate to provide projections in Fig. 47 or by giving the case plate a varying thickness in Fig. 48. The angle of this inclination corresponds to the angle at which the magnetic plate MAG is disposed with respect to the chip CHI, being equal to the angle of the inclined plates INM, INN of Fig. 2B. The inclination establishing portions formed by squeezing in Fig. 47 and preferably a small number of small projections rather than elongated projections extending perpendicularly to the sheet of drawing. The modified embodiment 4 is similar to the modified embodiment 1 of Fig. 38B in that the case RFS is processed so as to have a varying plate thickness, and is different therefrom as to which is inclined, the chip CHI or the magnetic MAG. This difference causes another difference as to whether the inclined plate INM is necessary to the magnetic body BIM. According to the present invention, because the air gap created between the shield case SHI and the magnetic plate MAG due to the inclination between the chip CHI and magnetic plate MAG is filled by sqieezing the revolving magnetic field confining case RFS, or by giving the same a varying plate thickness, it is unnecessary to use the inclined plate INN of Fig. 1B, thus not only minimizing the number of parts, but causing improved assembling.
