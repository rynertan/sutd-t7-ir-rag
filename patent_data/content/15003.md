# Coaxial type gas flow laser device.

## Abstract
In a coaxial type gas flow laser device in which the laser beam axis, the electric discharge axis and the gas flow axis are coincident, at least one centrifugal blower 12a, 12b is emp loyed for circulating a laser gas. Where two centrifugal blow ers 12a, 12b are employed, they oppose each other in an axial direction of discharge tubes 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d.
