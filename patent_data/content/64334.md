# Temperature surveillance system.

## Abstract
A lattice array of metal sheathed mineral insulated cables each cable having a coaxial conductor comprising alternate lengths of dissimilar thermo electric material to provide thermo electric junctions. The junctions are in two groups of opposite polarity and those of one group are disposed at the intersections of the cables whilst those of the other are disposed between intersections. Localised temper ature increases create differentials between groups of sen sors and can be located by the co ordinates of the lattice array.
