## Description
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for monitoring and analyzing on an on line basis the integrity of fluid containing vessels, and particularly nuclear reactor vessels, during both normal and abnormal fluid temperature and pressure transients. More particu larly, the invention is directed to presenting to a plant operator a visual representation of the margin between the reference nil ductility transition temperatures required for crack initiation and arrest, and the actual nil ductility transition temperature through the entire thick ness of the vessel at selected critical points taking into account, in the case of reactor vessels, the effects of radiation embrittlement. The invention also encompasses techniques for providing accurate determinations of reactor coolant temperature at critical locations in a nuclear reactor pressure vessel,, eVen during core cooling injec tions of cold coolant water under stagnant flow conditions. The pressure vessel in which the core of a nuclear reactor is housed is subjected throughout its nominal 40 year life to stresses induced by changes in reactor coolant temperature and pressure. During normal operations, these stresses are of moderate rate and amplitude and have no significant adverse effect on the vessel which is designed with a large safety margin to withstand the expected loading. These normal operations include heat up and cool down where restrictive schedules are rigorously followed to maintain the stresses within prescribed limits. During some abnormal operations, such as a loss of coolant accident a LOCA , temperature and or pressure transients which far exceed those which occur during normal operations may be experienced. Though some abnormal events may not impose serious stresses on the vessel themselves, corrective action taken to alleviate the initial problem, such as injecting cold water into the reactor, may lead to transients which could be a threat to vessel integrity. The reactor pressure vessel is a cylindrical enclosure with hemispherical ends which is fabricated from steel plates welded along longitudinal and circumferential seams. The upper hemispherical end, or head, is removable for access to the internals. Inlet and outlet nozzles, for each reactor coolant loop, typically 2 to 4 in a pressurized water reactor, are welded into the vessel walls. Typically, it is the welds where flaws are likely to be found which can develop into cracks under the stress induced by large thermal transients. The problem is compounded, in general, by embrittlement of the metal by the neutron radiation to which the vessel is subjected and is of most concern with regard to the welds at the level of the reactor core where the fluence is the highest. It is necessary for the operator of a nuclear power plant to be constantly aware of the status of the reactor pressure vessel with respect to non ductile failure. Presently, the operator has two means for obtaining this status standard heatup cooldown curves and the recently developed status tree approach. The heatup cooldown curves define the allowable pressure and temperature domain and are mandated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for use during normal startup and shutdown of the reactor. These curves are generated in accordance with Appendix G of Section III of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code A.S.M.E. code . They can also be utilized during an abnormal event to determine if the temperature and pressure transients remain within the limits established by the curves.The status tree approach, which was developed expressly to assess vessel integrity during pressurized thermal shock events, assumes a step change in temperature to provide a worst case scenerio and through the application of off line fracture mechanics analysis establishes pressure and temperature boundaries for a particular plant and provides instructions for actions to be taken as the boundaries are approached or exceeded. Both of these presently available methods of determining vessel integrity status are limited in the following ways 1 they utilize a quasi time dependent approach to determining vessel status, when in fact the fracture mechanics problem is a very time dependent function of both vessel temperature and pressure, which requires the introduction of excessive, unquantifiable conservatism into the status information since the operator is not provided with accurate knowledge of the actual margin to flaw initiation in the vessel wall as the plant is stabilizedand recovered from a cooldown transient 2 both methods use cold leg resistance temperature detector RTD temperatures as the indicator of current reactor vessel temperature thereby introducing uncertainties into the measurements, particularly in the event of thermal stratification as a result of safety injection flow under stagnant loop conditions,and rendering the determined status potentially imprecise and 3 both methods require operator interpretation of the cooldown history in order to provide a status, which is a time consuming and subjective task that must be performed, at times, under accident conditions. Under present practice, the U.S. Nuclear Regula tory Commission requires that if the heatup cooldown curve limits are exceeded during a thermal transient, an analysis must be performed before the reactor can be returned to power to determine whether conditions have occurred which could cause potential flaws to be initiated in the vessel. Such an analysis is performed after the fact and can cause a delay in returning the unit to power where the results indicate that critical conditions were not reached. Of course, if the analysis indicates that critical conditions have existed, then detailed inspections and or repairs may have to be performed. In the post event analysis of an abnormal plant transient, data from the event are used to construct temperature and the resulting stress profiles through the vessel at selected critical locations. Through the application of fracture mechanics analysis the stress profile is used to calculate how close the vessel may have come to non ductile failure. Specifically, the procedure postulates flaws of varying depth at the critical location and calculates for each such flaw the margin between the actual reference nil ductility transition temperature RT It is a primary object of the present invention to provide an accurate, easily understood, on line, real time representation of the integrity status of a vessel containing a fluid subject to varying temperature and pressure conditions and especially the pressure vessel of a nuclear reactor. The invention also achieves improved accuracy in determining the temperature of the reactor coolant adjacent the critical locations in the pressure vessel even during safety injection under stagnant flow conditions the invention also realizes the first objective through genera tion of a display which presents the operator with a real time visual indication of the current margin to non ductile failure for selected critical pressure vessel locations. The invention in its broad form comprises a method of on line monitoring and analysis of integrity against non ductile failure of a nuclear reactor pressure vessel wall, across a thickness thereof, by temperature measurements in a unit in which reactor coolant in use is circulated along an inner wall of the pressure vessel, said method comprising the steps of i generating signals representative of measured temperature of the reactor coolant on an on line basis ii generating signals representative of measured pressure of the reactor coolant on an on line basis characterized by iii gen erating on an on line basis, as a function of changes in the temperature and pressure signals, a visual represen tation of a margin to non ductile failure of the vessel at selected critical points for all flaw depths through the thickness of the vessel wall. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, an on line, real time fracture mechanics analy sis of a vessel containing a fluid subjected to varying temperature and pressure conditions is achieved by moni toring the fluid temperature and pressure and generating therefrom real time representations of the margin to non ductile failure at selected critical points in the vessel for all flaw depths of interest through the vessel wall. More particularly, a distribution through the vessel wall of the reference nil ductility transition temperature RT As applied to nuclear reactors, the fast neutron fluence is also monitored on a continuous, on line basis and used in generating the RT The invention is also directed to providing a more accurate determination of the temperature of the coolant at the critical locations in a reactor pressure vessel. The temperature is measured in the cold leg conduit and at the reactor core inlet, in other words, before and after it circulates past the critical locations in the vessel wall. These temperature readings are taken for each reactor coolant loop and analyzed to determine flow conditions. Readings within preset narrow limits indicate normal forced flow and the two measurements are merely averaged for the best determination of the coolant temperature along the vessel wall. Large differences in the temperature readings at the two locations indicate stagnant flow in the associated loop. Under these condi tions, empirically developed conversion factors which relate measured temperature to actual temperature at the vessel wall are applied to the measured temperatures before averaging. By applying appropriate safety factors to the pressure readings and to the fracture toughness, the invention can be used to provide a visual guide for effi cient performance during normal heatup and cooldown events. Should the optimum performance profile be inadvertently exceeded, vessel integrity analysis is immediately avail able to determine if a threat to vessel integrity was actually posed. In addition to providing the operator with a clear, unambiguous visual display based upon an in depth, real time analysis of vessel integrity, recommendations can also be provided to the operator for a suitable response when the analysis determines that vessel integrity was threatened. The present invention encompasses both method and apparatus for carrying out the above functions. A full understanding of the invention can be gained from the following description of a preferred exemplary embodiment to be read in conjunction with the attached drawings in which Figure 1 illustrates schematically the application of the invention to the nuclear steam supply system 1 of a pressurized water reactor PWR , but it is to be understood that the invention can be applied to other reactor systems also and even to other vessels or conduits containing fluid which is subjected to varying temperature and pressure conditions. The system shown in Figure 1 is a three loop PWR which includes a reactor 3 in which fission reactions are promoted at a controlled rate to generate heat energy. Reactor coolant in the form of light water is circulated through the reactor to absorb that heat generated by the fission reactions and is passed through hot leg conduits 5 in the three loops A, B C to heat exchangers in the form of steam generators 7 where the heat energy carried by the coolant generates steam in secondary loops not shown for use in driving a turbine generator combination which produces electric power. The coolant is returned to the reactor 3 from the steam generators 7 through cold leg corduits 9A, 9B and 9C by reactor coolant pumps llA, llB llC. A pressurizer 13 regulates reactor coolant pressure which is typically about 2250 psi with the reactor at power. The present invention utilizes reactor coolant pressure as measured by pressure transducer 15, cold leg temperatures as measured by resis tance temperature detectors 17 and neutron flux as measured by detector 19 all of which form a part of the conventional reactor control, monitoring and protection systems. One aspect of the present invention also utilizes thermocouples 21 which measure reactor core inlet temperatures. All of these measurements are processed by a general purpose digital computer 23 which performs the functions discussed below and generates visual displays for presentation on display device 25. The computer 23 may be the plant computer currently used for monitoring purposes or can be a separate, dedicated unit. As seen in Figure 2, the reactor 3 of a typical PWR includes a steel pressure vessel 27 with a cylindrical center section 29, a hemispherical lower head section 31 welded at 33 to the center section and a removable, hemispherical head bolted to a flange 37 at the upper end of the center section 29. The cylindrical center section 29 is fabricated from steel plates welded along both longitudinal 38 and circumferential welds 39. An inlet nozzle 41 and outlet nozzle 43 for each loop only 1 each shown are welded into the upper region of the center section 29 of the pressure vessel as shown at 45 and are connected to the loop cold leg conduit 9 and hot leg conduit 5 respectively. A core barrel 47 suspended from the upper flange 37 inside the pressure vessel 27 and spaced radially inward from the inner wall 49 of the vessel forms an annular downcomer 51. The lower end of the core barrel 47 is connected to a lower core support structure 53 which in turn is positioned in the vessel via keys on the lower core support structure and clevis blocks on the vessel wall 49 that form passages 55 through which the downcomer 51 communicates with the interior 57 of the hemispherical lower section 31 of the vessel. A reactor core, shown schematically at 59, is mounted inside the core barrel 47 between upper and lower core support plates 61 and 63 respectively. The lower core support structure 53 has additional apertures 65 through which the interior 57 of the hemispherical lower section 31 of the vessel communicates with a core inlet region 67 below the lower core plate 63. Above the upper core plate 61 is a region 69 in which the reactor control rods and drive mechanisms not shown are located. This region 69 is connetted to the hot leg conduits 5 by nozzle sections 71 on the core barrel which register with the outlet nozzles 43. As shown by the arrows in Figure 2, reactor coolant from cold leg conduit 9 enters the pressure vessel through inlet nozzle 41, and circulates along the inner wall 49 of the pressure vessel as it passes downward through downcomer 51. From the downcomer, it passes through passages 55 into region 57 and then upward through apertures 65 into inlet region 65. The reactor coolant then circulates upward through the core 59 where it absorbs the heat generated by fission reactions. The heated coolant passes into the region 69 from which it is discharged into the hot leg conduit 5 of each loop through an outlet nozzle 43. With the reactor operating at power, the temper ature of the reactor coolant returned through the cold leg conduits 9 is typically about 550 F Under steady state conditions, the thick walls of the pressure vessel reach a fairly uniform temperature throughout. However, due to the large mass of the pressure vessel, changes in reactor coolant temperature result in variations in the temperature across the thick vessel walls which can be substantial. This temperature gradient creates the stresses which are a function of the magnitude and the rate of the changes in coolant temperature. The stresses in the pressure vessel are also a function of the pressure of the reactor coolant. Under normal operating conditions, the temperature and pressure transients do not generate stresses in the pressure vessel walls which are a threat to vessel integrity. During startup and normal shutdown, the changes in temperature and pressure are regulated to remain within limits set by the NRC so that again, there is no threat to vessel integrity. Under some abnormal conditions, however, a safety injection system not shown injects cold, highly borated reactor coolant into the cold leg conduit 9 through conduit 73 to cool the core 59. The resultant change in the temperature of the coolant circulated along the inner walls of the pressure vessel can create large stresses which are a potential threat to vessel integrity. Generally, in each type of vessel, there are identifiable locatior.s which are most susceptible to non ductile failure resulting from the stresses generated by severe thermal or pressure transients. These critical locations are typically at a we1d location 45, especially the welds adjacent the core 59 where the fluence which causes embrittlement is greatest. The typical PWR has temperature sensors such as resistance temperature detectors RTDs 75 located in the cold leg conduits 9 for measuring reactor coolant temperature for control, monitoring, and protection purposes. Under normal flow conditions, these RTDs provide a reasonably accurate measurement of the temperature of the reactor coolant as it circulates along the inner wall 49 of the pressure vessel for most purposes. However, in accordance with the present invention which provides the capability of making a more precise determination of the margin to non ductile failure in a pressure vessel urder thermal shock transients, a more accurate determination of the temperature of the reactor in the downcomer 51 is desirable. PWRs are typically provided with instrumentation thimbles or guide tubes 77 which extend upward through the reactor core from below to provide access in the core for fixed or movable sensors such as neutron flux detectors. In accordance with the invention, the thermocouples 21 are installed in some of these thimbles in the core inlet area 67 below the lower core plate 63 which protects them from excessive radiation emitted by the reactor core 59. These thermocouples provide an accurate measure of the temperature of the reactor coolant in this area. Figure 3 is a plan view illustrating a suitable arrangement of thermocouples 21 according to the invention in certain fuel cells 79 which make up the core 59 of a typical 3 loop PWR. Instrumentation thimbles are not provided in every fuel cell, but are distributed across the core in a pattern which provides representative flux measurements. Representative reactor coolant temperature measurements are obtained by locating thermocouples in thimbles at the locations shown by the reference character 21 with the appropriate loop suffix. The solid dots indicate exemplary locations for redundant thermocouple measurement points for each loop while the open circle indicates a suitable location for the third measurement point for each loop when increased reliability is desired. As indicated, the thermocouples for each loop are in substantial vertical alignment with the inlet nozzle for the associated loop each of which is represented in Figure 3 by a radial arrow. Figure 4 illustrates a combination in core instru mentation thimble 77 suitable for use with the invention. Such a thimble includes an outer tube 81 and an eccentrically mounted inner tube 83 in which a movable in core neutron flux detector not shown is received. Redundant 3 shown inlet thermocouple leads 21 are inserted in the space 85 between the inner and outer tubes along with a number of core outlet thermocouple leads 87 presently provided to measure the temperature of the reactor coolant as it leaves the core. In accordance with the teachings of the invention, the thermocouple readings taken in the core inlet area are used in conjunction with the temperature measurements made by the RTDs in the cold leg conduit to provide a more accurate determination of the temperature of the reactor coolant in the downcomer. Under normal flow conditions, the temperatures at these two locations, before and after the coolant passes through the downcomer, do not differ appreciably and the two readings are averaged to determine the temperature of the coolant to which the pressure vessel walls 49 are exposed. This remains true during safety injection of cold borated water into the cold leg conduits as long as the reactor coolant pumps are still operating to effect mixing of the warm .coolant circulating in the loop and the cold injection water. However, during the course of some abnormal events, the normal flow of reactor coolant in one or more loops stops, or is terminated by the operator in responding to the initial event. Cold water injected into a cold leg conduit under these stagnant flow conditions may tend to stratify so that the RTD temperature readings are not necessarily representative of the temperature of the coolant circulating along the inner wall 49 of the pressure vessel. The pattern of stratification under stagnant flow conditions remains reasonably consistent so that conversion factors for convert ing both the RTD and inlet thermocouple temperature readings to downcomer temperatures can be determined empirically for each reactor design. The more accurate measurement of the temperature of the coolant flowing along the inner wall of the vessel available with this technique reduces the need for conservatism in the analysis of vessel integrity thereby increasing the operating margin of the reactor. In accordance with the invention then, one or more critical locations in the vessel are selected from the design of the pressure vessel for monitoring. As mentioned previ ously, these critical locations most likely are found at the welds and especially the welds adjacent the reactor core where the fast neutron fluence is highest resulting in the most severe embrittlement of the weld material. Typically, one to several critical locations are chosen for monitoring. The physical characteristics of each of these locations, including the geometry, the thermal properties, and the copper and nickel content, are provided to the computer. The neutron flux is monitored and integrated with time to measure the fluence at each critical location. The temperature of the reactor coolant for each of the critical locations is determined continually from the RTDs and the inlet thermo couples with appropriate conversion factors for stagnant flow if applicable. These temperatures, along with on line reactor coolant pressure measurements, and the fluence measurements are utilized to make an on line, real time analysis of the vessel integrity at the critical locations using fracture analysis. Such an analysis is made automatically when the rate of change in temperature and pressure indicate an abnormal condition. During heatup and cooldown, compliance with Appendix G criteria established by Section III of the A.S.M.E. code previously mentioned is monitored and if compromised, an immediate analysis is made to determine how close the vessel may have come to non ductile failure. A more detailed explanation of the operation of the invention can be gained from the flow diagrams of Figures 5 through 8 which set forth the programs carried out by the digital computer 23 in gathering the data from the plant and performing the on line, real time analysis of the vessel integrity. Initially, as shown in block 89 in Figure 5, a flag which indicates whether or not a pressure and or temperature transient of sufficient magnitude is in progress to necessitate a vessel integrity analysis is set equal to FALSE. The program then awaits the next scan time in block 91. The scan interval is selected taking into account the severity of possible abnormal events and the time required for an appropriate response. A suitable interval is about 1 to 2 minutes. When a scan is started in block 93, the current reactor coolant pressure, P t , as measured by the transducer 15, is read, converted to engineering units and calibrated in block 95. If this current pressure reading exceeds the reading recorded on the last scan, as determined in block 97, by an amount, e After the pressure has been checked, the temper ature of the coolant in each reactor coolant loop is determined sequentially in a program loop which is entered at block 101. In this program loop, which is shown in Figure 6, the temperature of the reactor coolant in the cold leg conduit as measured by the resistance temperature detectors, RTDs, is read, converted to engineering units, and calibrated in block 103. Typically, redundant RTDs are provided in each cold leg, and other parts of the plant, which already use these temperature measurements for other purposes, check the individual signals for validity and provide a composite reading for the loop. This value of the cold leg temperature is compared with the value stored from the previous scan in block l05, and if it differs by a preselected value, for example 5 F, indicating a significant transient which requires analysis, the analysis flag is made TRUE in block 107. Next, each of the redundant inlet thermocouple signals for the loop are read, converted to engineering units, calibrated and intercompared with each other in block 109. If this intercomparison shows the readings to be valid as determined in block 111, a composite thermocouple signal for the loop is generated in block 113, as by averaging and this composite value is compared with the corresponding value on the previous scan in block 115. If the current value differs from the previous value by more than a preselected amount, again, an exemplary value is about 5 F for a scan interval of one to two minutes, the analysis flag is set to TRUE in block 117. The program then loops back to block 101 and checks the temperature readings for the next reactor coolant loop, N. If the thermocouple readings are not valid, the operator is alerted in block 119 before the next reactor coolant loop is analyzed. When all of the reactor coolant loop temperatures have been processed, the program proceeds by way of tag B back to Figure 5 where the analysis flag is checked in block 121. If the pressure and all the loop temperatures are within limits, the program returns to block 91 and awaits the next scan. If an analysis is required, however, an event timer is started on the initial scan in which the transient is detected as carried out in blocks 123 and 125, and the program then proceeds to Figure 7 as indicated by the tag C. In carrying out the analysis function, the signals representative of the on line plant specific vessel and material properties are generated and or stored as indicated generally by reference character 127 in Figure 7. This includes storing vessel geometric and thermal properties for each of the critical locations, j, of the vessel in block 129. It also includes generating the fast neutron fluence at each location j, as shown by block 131. The fluence can be calculated, for instance, by multiplying an effective full power hour signal available from the plant computer by a stored neutron flux rate signal for each critical location. Alternatively, if the local neutron flux is available at the locations j, it can be integrated with time to determine the current fast neutron fluence. The stored plant specific values also include, for each critical location j, the initial reference nil ductility transition temperature, RT The on line plant specific vessel and material properties signals are also utilized in the generation of the required RT When stagnant flow conditions are detected in block 141 for a given loop, the RTD temperature and an empirically established RTD correlation factor are used to estimate the reactor coolant temperature in the downcomer. Alternatively, or in addition, an estimate of the downcomer temperature can be derived from the composite inlet thermocouple temperature and the empirically established thermocouple correlation factor as indicated in block 151. Where both correlations are used, a best estimate for the reactor coolant temperature in the downcomer is calculated in block 153 as the average of the two estimated temperatures. This reactor coolant temper ature for stagnant flow conditions is displayed to the operator as indicated in block 145 and the heat transfer coefficient is set for free convection in block 155. Next the temperature of the reactor coolant at critical location j is determined in block 157 using the appropriate reactor coolant loop temperature and the existing flow conditions. This temperature and the measured reactor coolant pressure are then utilized to perform a real time fracture analysis of the vessel at each critical location. First, the reactor coolant temperature at location j and the heat transfer coefficient, t , together with the vessel specific properties, are used in block 159 to generate a real time temperature distribution through the vessel wall at location j. A similar distribution of pressure through the wall at location j is also generated in block 159. The temperature and pressure distributions are then used in block 161 to generate a distribution through the vessel wall of real time thermal and pressure stress at location j. Next, a distribution of the real time stress intensity factor, K The temperature distribution through the vessel wall generated in block 159, is used along with the actual RT The stress intensity factor distribution and fracture initiation toughness distribution are then used in block 169 to generate a required RT By comparing the required RT Figure 10 illustrates an instant in a transient when the required RT There is a theory discussed in the above cited ASME paper that a running crack in a material subjected to a stress field will arrest when the stress intensity factor becomes smaller than a property identified as the arrest fracture toughness, K This visual display provides the operator with a very powerful tool for monitoring and, if necessary, con trolling conditions which affect the integrity of the reactor pressure vessel. For instance, by monitoring the display under the conditions shown in Figure 9, the operator can observe what the margin to flaw initiation is. By observing successive displays, which may be stored for rapid playback, the operator can learn how fast the margin is changing and guage whether flaw initiation conditions are likely to occur. If flaw initiation conditions should occur, the display of Figure 10 provides the operator with information on the depth of a flaw that must be present for flaw propagation and the depth that it would likely propagate to before arrest. The display can also be used to provide additional information about vessel integrity. For instance, as can be seen from the required RT In addition, for safety reasons a maximum depth at which a flaw must be arrested to avoid catastrophic failure can also be established, and a trace, M, may be presented on the display at this point as shown in Figure 10. The display then also provides a visual indication of a margin, p, between the maximum flaw arrest depth which occurs at point g and the acceptance criteria for vessel failure as represented by the trace M. Thus, even if a flaw propagated, as long as the margin to the maximum flaw arrest depth is large enough, it can be reliably determined that catastrophic failure is not a threat. As a further feature of the invention, recommenda tions for action to be taken by the operator to alleviate the situation where there is a threat, or an imminent threat, to vessel integrity can be provided automatically. As part of this feature, indications can be provided in association with the display as to the seriousness of the threat such as, for example, by color coding, special indicia, flashing video, audio signals or any combination of these or other indica tions. For instance, the required RT When an abnormal event occurs in a nuclear reac tor, the object is to satisfy a series of well defined critical safety functions which return the reactor to nor mal operation, or place it in a safe shutdown mode. For example, in a loss of coolant accident, the object is to stabilize the reactor at a safe temperature. Accordingly, following the check of the status tree criteria in Figure 7, a determination is made in block 177 whether or not the critical safety function for the particular event which has occurred has been reached. If not, the program returns, as indicated by tag E, to block 91 in Figure 5 to await the next scan. If the critical safety function has been satisfied, the program ends, until another event occurs and the program is restarted in Figure 5 at block 89. The invention may also be used for monitoring and analysis during normal plant heatup and cooldown. These conditions are detected in block 137 of Figure 7 by a determination that the temperature and pressure transients are within the Appendix G criteria. The actual reactor coolant temperature and pressure readings are displayed to the operator in block 145 as in the case of an abnormal thermal shock event. As indicated by tag D, a determination is then made in block 179 of Figure 8 of the reactor coolant temperature for the critical location x chosen for monitoring and analysis during the heatup or cooldown transient. Gene ration of a signal representative of this temperature is accomplished in the same manner as pre iously described for full flow conditions. Next the heat transfer coefficient, h, is set for forced convection in block 181 for use in generation of the pressure and temperature distributions through the vessel wall at location x as indicated in block 183. As required by Appendix G Section III of the A.S.M.E. code, a safety factor of two is applied to the pressure load in block 185 before a temperature and pressure stress distribution at location x is generated in block 187. If it is determined in block 189 that a heatup condition exists, a longitudinal reference flaw to a fractional depth of 0.25 of the wall thickness with an aspect ratio of 6 1 length to depth is postulated on the outside surface of the vessel as indicated in block 191. On the otherhand, for cooldown conditions, a similar flaw is postu lated in block 193 on the inner surface of the vessel. The appropriate flaw is used in block 195 together with the temperature and pressure stress to generate a stress intensity factor, K As in the case of an abnormal thermal shock event, Appendix G criteria can be checked in block 203, and instructions as necessary may be presented to the operator in block 205. For instance, if conditions indicate that the heatup or cooldown event is entering a caution status, it could be recommended to the operator to switch to abnormal thermal shock event analysis where the event can be monitored more closely while corrective action is being taken. From the above description, it can be appreciated that the present invention not only monitors the temperature and pressure during a thermal shock event, but provides an on line analysis of the.effects of these transients on vessel integrity and presents recommendations to the operator of steps to be taken to alleviate their effects. It can also be used to maintain an optimum profile during heatup and cooldown, and could even be used, if desired, to generate conventional heatup and cooldown curves, as defined in Appendix G of the A.S.M.E. code. The invention can also immediately provide the detailed fracture mechanics results for assessment following an abnormal event such that appro priate authorities can determine if the reactor vessel can be safely returned to normal operation. While specific embodiments of the invention have been described in detail, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that various modifications and alterna tives to those details could be developed in light of the overall teachings of the disclosure. Accordingly, the particular arrangements disclosed are meant to be illustra tive only and not limiting as to the scope of the invention which is to be given the full breadth of the appended claims and any and all equivalents thereof.
