# A bias control circuit for light emitting diode having temperature compensation.

## Abstract
A bias control circuit for a light emitting diode having compensation of the light output at changing temperature, in which the light emitting diode led used as temperature sen sor is taken up together with a series resistor R3 in a series circuit to which a fixed supply voltage is applied. A further se ries circuit of two resistors R1, R2 having strongly different values is connected parallel across the series resistor R3 and a differential amplifier A1 is provided, the one and the other input of which are connected respectively to the junction of the two resistors R1, R2 and to a setting voltage Vi , and the output of which is connected to a control means Tr1 taken up in series with the one series circuit.
