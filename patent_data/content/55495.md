# Process for the preparation of a cycloalkene through partial hydrogenation of the corresponding aromatic hydrocarbon.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of a cycloalkene through partial hydrogenation of the corres ponding aromatic hydrocarbon in the gas phase in the presence of a ruthenium catalyst, in which process this hydrogenation is carried out in the presence of water vapour.
