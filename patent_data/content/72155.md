# Wholly aromatic polyester capable of forming an anisotropic melt phase.

## Abstract
A novel wholly aromatic polyester is provided which exhi bits an anisotropic melt phase and which is capable of readily undergoing melt processing. The polyester of the present in vention comprises the recurring units a paraoxybenzoyl moiety, b bromo substituted para oxybenzoyl moiety, and c meta oxybenzoyl moiety. The resulting polymer may be economically produced. Additionally, it may be melt processed at an advantageous temperature which makes possible the uti lization of standard equipment such as that heretofore utilized for the melt processing of polyethylene terephthalate.
