Another aspect of this invention is a method of inhibiting the growth of animal tumor cells sensitive to a compound of formula I which comprises administering to an animal afflicted with said tumor cells, an effective, tumor cell growth inhibiting amount of a compound of formula I . DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION By the term thiosugar is meant any l thioaldose.Examples of such thiosugars include 1 thioglucose, l thiogalactose, l thiomannose, l thioribose, l thiomaltose, l thiofucose, tetra O acetyl l thioglucose, tetra O acetyl l thiomannose, tetra O acetyl l thio galactose, tri O acetyl l thior ibose, hepta O acetyll thiomaltose, tri O acetyl l thiofucose. By the term selenosugar is meant any nonacetylated l selenoaldose. Examples of such selenosugars include l selenoglucose, l selenomannose, l seleno galactose, l selenoribose, l selenomaltose and l selenofucose. Preferred compounds of formula I include those wherein W is 1 thioglucose, l thiogalactose and l thiomannose. These compounds are preferred because they exhibit particularly active tumor inhibiting activity in a variety of test systems. All the compounds encompassed by formula I can be prepared by methods available to one skilled in the art. Generally, the compounds of formula I , wherein W is a non acetylated l thioaldose or l selenoaldose, are prepared by reacting the appropriate derivative of formula it EMI3.1 wherein k is as defined above, with the appropriate sodium thiosugar or sodium selenothiosugar. The desired non acetylated thiosugar or selenosugar can be obtained commercially or by methods available to one skilled in the art. The desired derivative of formula II can be obtained by reacting the appropriate diphosphino hydrocarbon of formula III EMI4.1 wherein A is as defined above, directly with chloroauric acid hydrate or a reduced form of the acid hydrate obtained by treatment with thiodiglycol. For example, a solution of thiodiglycol in a nonreactive organic solvent, such as methanol or ethanol, is reacted with an aqueous solution of dhloroaure acid hydrate cooled to a temperature of from 10 to 0 C, and then treated with a solution of the appropriate formula III compound in a nonreactive organic solvent system, such as a mixture of chloroform and methanol,, for from one to two hours to give the corresponding formula 11 compound.Similarly, chloroauric acid hydrate in a nonreactive organic solvent, such as methanol or ethanol, is reacted with a solution of the appropriate formula III compound at ambient temperature for from one to two hours to give the corresponding formula 11 compound. All formula III compounds necessary as starting materials for making the formula II compounds are available commercially, for example, from Strem Chemicals Inc., Danvers,Massachusetts. The compounds of formula I wherein W is a per O acetyl thiosugar can be prepared by reacting the appropriate derivative of formula II with the appropriate per O acetyl thiopseudourea hydrobromide , all of which are available commercially or can be prepared by methods available to one skilled in the art. See, for example, Durette et al., Carb. Res., 81, 261 1980 . As an alternate route, the compounds of formula I wherein W is a non acetylated thiosugar or selenosugar can be prepared from the corresponding per o acetyl derivative by treating the acetylated compound with a hydrolyzing base, such as methanolic ammonia or sodium methoxide in methanol, to give the desired non acetylated compound of formula I . The appropriate per O acetyl selenosugar starting material can be prepared by reacting the appropriate derivative of formula II with the appropriate per O acetyl selenopseudourea hydrobromide , all of which are available commercially or can be prepared by methods available to one skilled in the art. See, for example, Durette et al., Carb. Res., .81, 261 1980. As stated above, the compounds of formula I have tumor cell growth inhibiting activity which has been demonstrated in a variety of test systems. The B16 mouse melanoma cell assay measures the ability of a compound to inhibit the clonogenic capacity of cells in vitro following a two hour exposure to the compound. The cytotoxic activity of the compounds of formula I was evaluated in vitro using B16 melanoma cells according to the following protocol B16 melanoma highly metastatic subline, F10 are used and maintained as monolayer cultures in Minimal Essential Media Grand Island Biological Co., Grand Island, N.Y. supplemented with 10 calf serum, 1 antibiotics in a 5 CO2 humidified incubator at 37 0C. Asynchronous populations of cells are harvested and replated to 5000 cells plate in sterile 60 mm x 15 mm petri plates. Plates are incubated overnight to allow attachment of the cells to the plate. Cells are treated with the compound to be evaluated under sterile conditions, allowed to react for 2 hours followed by aspiration of medium. Plates are washed one time with 5 ml of phosphate buffered saline PBS , followed by the addition of 5 ml of fresh media. Plates are incubated for 5 days at 37 in a CO2 incubator. Viability is measured by the ability of a cell to form a colony of greater than 50 cells. Colonies are fixed with 0.5 crystal violet in 95 ethanol. Plates are dried and counted with a Biotran III Automatic Count Totalized New Brunswick Scientific Co., Edisonr N.J. . Mean and standard deviation of triplicate Samples are determined for each drug concentration.The data are analyzed by plotting the log of the survival fraction number of colonies in drug treated plates number of colonies in controls versus the drug concentratinn. An evaluation of one particular compound of formula I in the in vitro B16 cytotoxic assay is shown in Table I. TABLE IEMI6.1 IC50 FCS a Compound No. A w uM 1 CR2 l thioglucose 1 0.2 a concentration of drug which inhibits cloning efficiency of B16 melanoma cells by 50 upon 2 hour exposure drug exposure in the presence of 10 fetal calf serum.Additionally, in another in vitro assay, Compound No. 1 effectively killed HT 29 human colon carcinoma cells, with an IC50 FCS of 5 uM following a 2 hour exposure. P388 lymphocytic leukemia is currently the most widely used animal tumor model for screening for antitumor agents and for detailed evaluation of active compounds.This tumor system is widely accepted as an antitumor agent screening tool because it is sensitive to virtually all of the clinically active antineoplastic agents quantitative and reproducible amenable for large scale screening and predictive for activity in other animal tumor models.Drugs that are highly active in intraperitoneal ip P388 leukemia are generally active in other tumor models as well. The antitumor activity of the compounds of formula I is demonstrated in the P388 leukemia mouse model employing the following protocol 106 P388 leukemia cells are inoculated ip in B6D2F1 mice. Twenty four hours later, if the tumor inoculum proves to be free of bacterial contamination as determined by 24 hours incubation in thioglycollate broth , animals are randomized into groups of 6 and housed in shoebox cages. The compound to be evaluated is dissolved in a minimal volume of either N,N dimethyl acetamide DMA or 95 ethanol depending upon solubility .An equal volume of saline is added if the drug comes out of solution an equal volume of polyethoxylated castor oil is added and then saline qs to a concentration such that the desired dose is delivered in 0.5 ml. The final concentration of DMA, ethanol and polyethoxylated castor oil is 10 percent. Dilutions for lower doses are made with saline so there is a decreasing proportion of organic solvents in the vehicle with decreasing dosage. These vehicles provide soluble formulations or suspensions . Formulations are prepared immediately prior to injection. The compound is administered ip on Days 1 through 5 i.e. treatment is initiated 24 hrs after tumor inoculation . Each experiment includes three groups of 6 animals as untreated controls and animals treated with a positive controlr cisplatin, at two dose levels. Animals are weighed as a group on Days 1, 5 and 9 and average weight change wt. is used as a reflection of toxicity. Each experiment also incudes an inoculum titration .groups of 8 mice inoculated ip with 105 to 10 P388 leukemia cells. The titration is used to calculate cell kill achieved by treatment with drugs. Animals are monitored daily for mortality and experiments are terminated after 45 days. The endpoint is median survival time MST and increase in lifespan ILS which is the percentage of increase in MST relative to untreated controls. Untreated controls inoculated ip with 106 P388 leukemia cells generally survive for a median of 10 or 11 days. A drug is considered active if it produces 25 percent ILS. A summary of the evaluation of several compounds of formula I in the in vivo P388 model is shown in the following Table A.

Based on the data set forth in Table A, compounds of formula I showed significant antitumor activity in the in vivo ip P388 leukemia tumor assay. In particular,Compounds No. 1, 2 and 3 have particularly good activity in the P388 leukemia assay with an ILS comparable to the clinically useful antitumor agent cisplatin. Another chemosensitive tumor model is intraperitoneally ip implanted M5076 reticulum cell sarcoma in mice. Inthis system B6D2F female mice are inoculated with 0.5in of a 10 percent w v brei of M5076 prepared from pooled sbcutaneous sc tumors excised at about 21 days from C57B1 6 donors. Drugs are administered ip.Daily treatement is begun 24 hours after implantation and is continued for ten days. The treatment regimen for M5Q76 is more prolonged than for P388 because of the slower growth rate and longer control survival time of the M5076 tuner. The antitumor activity oe Compounds No. 1 and No. 2 of Table A in the M5076 reticulum cell sarcoma tumor model is set forth in Table 2.

The cytotoxic activity of Compound No. 1 fromTable A was evaluated in vivo using B16 melanoma cells.In this system, groups of eight B6D2F1 mice are inoculated ip with 0.5 ml of a 10 w v brei of B16 melanoma prepared from pooled sc tumors excised at 14 21 days from C67B1 6 donor mice. Daily treatment is begun 24 hours after tumor implantation and is continued daily for ten 10 days. The route of drug administration is ip. The mice are monitored daily for survival for sixty 60 days. Antitumor activity is assessed by prolongation of median survival time. An ILS of 25 indicates activity in this tumor model.

Similarly, in another additional in vivo tumor model, namely B16 melanoma in mice, Compound No. 1 fromTable A, administered ip in a dosage schedule of 8, 4, 2, 1 and 0.5 mg kg produced an average increase in lifespan ILS of 328 at a maximally tolerated dose MTD of 3.4 ciM kg. Compound No. 1 from Table A was also tested in a further in vivo tumor model, mammary adenocarcinoma 16 c, a tumor model sensitive to DNA binders and alkylating agents. In this experiment, the tumor was implanted sc in C3R mice, and the drug was administered ip or iv on an intermittant treatment schedule, i.e., once on days 1, 5, 9, 13 and 17. Tumors were measured 3 weeks after implantation, and activity was assessed by degree of tumor growth inhibition. Cisplatin, a drug which generally produces complete inhibition of the growth of mammary adenocarcinoma 16 c, was used as a positive control. A tumor growth inhibition of 75 indicates that a drug is active in this type of animal tumor model. The results of this assay are summarized in Table B.
