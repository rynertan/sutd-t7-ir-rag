An oven 16 for drying the wet coating may be used to remove the water from the coating to form a dried film on the container without distorting the container, and in this case the oven is separated from the booth by the conveyor. Means 18 may be provided for rotating the bottles during coating, during transport between the spray coating booth and the oven, and while in the oven. The coating booth includes a system 82, 84 for containing and removing both airborne and liquid overspray from the booth, and preferably a dual delivery system 120, 124A B, 128 for delivering the coating material to the spray nozzles and for reverse flushing the delivery sys tem. The system operates to provide a continuously moving series of containers with a spray coating at production rates suitable for commercial applications.
