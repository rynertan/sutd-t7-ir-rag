# Anti creep vehicle braking system allowing further additional braking action application.

## Abstract
An anti creep braking system for a vehicle. A force transmission member is drivingly coupled to a part of the brake pedal and transmits braking force to a braking force generation system. A braked member is selectively braked by a braking device, and is driven by the brake pedal with a one direction force transmission device being interposed on the path of transmission of force between the brake pedal and the braked member. The sense of force transmission of the one direction force transmission device is such that, when the movement of the braked member with respect to the vehicle is prevented by the braking device, the brake pedal may be further depressed to increase vehicle braking action without transmitting substantial force to the braked member, but may not be moved backwards to reduce vehicle braking action. A control system selectively controls the braking device so as to put it into operation and to release it from operation according to the operational conditions of the vehicle effected by the driver of the vehicle and or skidding condition of the vehicle.
