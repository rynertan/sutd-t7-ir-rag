# Reel table assembly.

## Abstract
A reel table assembly for driving a tape reel 9 which has a center hole 10 and a plurality of equally spaced inwardly extending radial teeth 11 formed circumferential ly thereof comprises a reel table 2 formed centrally with a reel shaft 3 for carrying thereon the tape reel 9 with the center hole 10 , and a plurality of equally spaced drive pawls 4 which are provided circumferentialiy in the reel shaft 3 and project radially outwardly of the reel shaft 3 under a resilient force for mesh engagement with the radial teeth 11 of the tape reel 9 . The drive pawls 4 are mov able radially inwardly of the reel shaft 3 when the tape reel 9 is carried on the reel table 2 with the radial teeth 11 being in radial abutment on the drive pawls 4 . A friction member 5 is provided on the reel table 2 for direct contact with the tape reel 9 to provide a high degree of friction between the reel table 2 and the tape reel 9 carried on the reel table 2 . The reel table 2 also comprises a low friction means 20 provided on the reel table 2 for direct contact with the tape reel 9 to maintain the tape reel 9 lifted off the friction member 5 only when the tape reel 9 is carried on the reel table 2 with the radial teeth 11 being in radial abutment with the drive pawls 4 .
