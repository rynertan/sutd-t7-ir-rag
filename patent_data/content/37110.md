# Specific antibody and its use in an enzyme immuno assay.

## Abstract
In an enzyme immunoassay when a specific antibody produced by contacting a peptide essential to the formation of a specific antibody to a peptide antigen, a freeze dried material of β D galactosidase enzyme conjugate or a pep tide enzyme conjugate prepared by coupling a labeling enzyme with a peptide of the general formula H R₁ Pro Ser Asp Thr Pro Ile Leu Pro Gln OH wherein R₁ is a peptide fragment consisting of a 1 to 14 amino acid residues including Gly in the 14 position of the peptide Ala¹ Pro² Pro³ Pro⁴ Ser⁵ Leu⁶ Pro⁷ Ser⁸ Pro⁹ Ser¹⁰ Arg¹¹ Leu¹² Pro¹³ Gly¹⁴ is used, a high reproducibility of the result of the enzyme immunoassay is obtained.
