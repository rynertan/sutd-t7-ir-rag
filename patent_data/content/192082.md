# Lead connector.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a system wherein any two of a plurality of connector surfaces on a stimulation lead can be connected to the output of an electrical stimulation device. The two conductors in the second connector may be coupled to the output of a stimulation device. By sliding the connector end of the stimulating lead with respect to the connector on the stimulating device, any two electrodes may be coupled to the output of the electrical stimulator.
