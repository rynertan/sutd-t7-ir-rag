# Multiple layer oriented sheet structure, method of making it and retortable pouches made therefrom.

## Abstract
A sheet structure e.g. 310 has oriented layers of nylon 312 and EVOH 314 additional layers may or may not be utilized, and may or may not be oriented. Where additional layers are used, one of the additional layers 320 on the exterior surface of the structure 310 is preferably heat sealable. A retortable pouch made from this structure has improved impact resistance after retort processing, over similar structures having no oriented nylon and EVOH layers, and can have improved stress crack resistance when drop ped onto a hard surface.
