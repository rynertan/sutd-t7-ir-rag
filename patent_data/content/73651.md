# Method of manufacturing bladed elements for rotary fluid machines.

## Abstract
A method of manufacturing a bladed element 19 of a rotary fluid machine, for example a turbine or a compressor, includes the steps of securing a plurality of blades 24 in a gas tight manner in respective openings in a wall 22 of a hollow casing 23 with one end of each blade 24 in the hollow interior of the casing and the remainder of the blade externally of the casing, finnig the casing 23 with powder 25 which surrounds the blade ends within the casing, hermetically sealing the casing, and isostatically pressing the casing around the blade ends to form the casing 23 , the powder 25 and the blade ends into a monolithic body.
