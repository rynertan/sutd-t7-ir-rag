# A method of manufacturing a shadow mask for a colour cathode ray tube.

## Abstract
A method of manufacturing a shadow mask for a colour cathode ray tube includes the steps of annealing a sheet of iron nickel alloy, and forming the sheet, after annealing, into a shadow mask by pressing while the sheet is kept at a predeter mined forming temperature effective to reduce the yield strength of the alloy and perforating the sheet.
