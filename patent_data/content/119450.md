## Description
CHEMICAL PROCESS AND INTERMEDIATES FOR USE THEREINThe present invention relates to a process for the preparation of substituted amino pyrazolines, to certain intermediate compounds in the process which are novel, pharmaceutical formulations containing such compounds and their use in medicine.Certain 3 substituted amino 2 pyrazolines are known in the art to exhibit anti inflammatory activity. Although there are many methods for the preparation of 3 amino 2 pyrazolines, fewer methods are known for the preparation of 3 amino.2 pyrazolines in which the 3 amino group is substituted by one or two substituents.Duffin and Kendall J.Chem.Soc. 1954,408 have prepared 1 phenyl 3 ethylamino 2 pyrazoline by treatment of the corresponding 1 phenyl 3 amino 2 pyrazoline with acetic acid in acetic anhydride followed by reduction of the intermediate 1 phenyl 3 acetamido 2 pyrazoline with lithium aluminium hydride. However, the acylation step is low yielding, resulting in an overall low yield of the 3 ethylamino 2 pyrazoline from the unsubstituted 3 amino 2 pyrazoline starting material. Moreover, the use of lithium aluminium hydride on a commercial scale is both hazardous and costly, and requires special precautions and techniques, such as use of anhydrous solvents.European Patent Specification No. 0 055 418 discloses the preparation of l substituted phenyl 3 alkylamino 2 pyrazolines by reduction of the corresponding 3 acylamino 2 pyrazolines. This process suffers the disadvantage of requiring use of lithium aluminium hydride.Elguero et al Bull.Soc.Chim.France. 1970, p.1571, 1576 have prepared 3 N ethylamino 2 pyrazolines by the method of Duffin Kendall, and attempted to substitute further the amino group by carrying out a second acylation reduction sequence to form I phenyl 3 N,N diethylamino 2 pyrazoline via the intermediate 1 phenyl 3 N acetyl 3 N ethylamino 2 pyrazoline.However, the identity of the product of the acylation reaction was not confirmed, and was thought to be either the desired 1 phenyl 3 N acetyl 3 N ethylamino 2 pyrazoline, or, the product formed by acylation of the ring nitrogen instead of the exocylic amino nitrogen and, the reduction of the intermediate resulted in low yields and mixtures of products, the two major products being identified as l phenyl 3 ethylamino 2 pyrazoline and 1 phenyl 2 pyrazoline.We have now discovered a new process for the preparation of 3 N substituted amino and 3 N,N disubstituted amino 2 pyrazolines which provides acceptable yields, does not result in mixtures of products, and does not require the use of lithium aluminium hydride The new process also proceeds via intermediates which themselves show advantageous stability and possess valuable pharmacological properties.In one aspect the present invention provides a process for the preparation of 3 N substituted amino 2 pyrazolines, of formula I EMI2.1 wherein,Ar is an aryl group, optionally substituted by one or more suitable substituents R1 is alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, alkoxy, aryl, aralkyl, aralkenyl or aralkynyl R2 is hydrogen, alkyl or aralkyl and R3 and R4 are the same or different, each being hydrogen or alkyl, which comprises i reacting of a compound of formula II EMI2.2 wherein,Ar is an aryl group, optionally substituted by one or more suitable substituents R3 and R4 are the same or different, and each may be alkyl or hydrogen andR5 is acyl or aroyl with a compound serving to effect substitution of a group R1 as defined in formula I on the amino group attached to the 3 position of the pyrazoline ring in the compound of formula II , thereby to form a compound of formula III EMI3.1 wherein Ar, R1, R3, R4 and R5 are as hereinbefore defined and converting the compound of formula III to a compound of formula U or an acid addition salt thereof.Within the definition of compounds of formulae II and III are also included, where appropriate, the acid addition salts of such compounds.

Asplrln like drugs are not however effective against the leucocyte mediated aspects of chronic inflammatory disease, since they do not inhibit leukotriene formation. In contrast to non steroid anti inflammatory drugs, corticosteroidal anti inflammatory drugs indirectly inhibit the formation of both prostaglandins and leucotrienes, which could, in part, account for their superior therapeutic effect when compared to aspirin like drugs. Steroid treatment is, however, associated with serious local or systemic side effects and prolonged administration is contra indicated in many inflammatory conditions.The compounds of formula IIIA fulfill the need for a non steroid anti inflammatory compound which inhibits the synthesis of leukotrienes and prostaglandins and which is free from steroid related toxicity. They have also been shown to be more stable than closely related compounds known in the art, such as are disclosed in European Specification 55 418.When used in medicine, the acid addition salts where such exist of a compound of formula CIIIA should be both pharmacologically and pharmaceutically acceptable, but non acceptable salts may conveniently be used to prepare the bases of such acceptable salts and are not excluded from the scope of this invention Acceptable salts may be derived from organic acids, particularly dicarboxylic acids. Such pharmacologically and pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those prepared from the following acids hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulphuric, nitric, phosphoric, oxalic, fumaric, maleic, glycolic, salicyclic, succinic, toluene p sulphonic, tartaric, acetic, citric, methane sulphonic, formic, benzoic, malonic, naphthalene 2 sulphonic and benzene sulphonic. The compounds of formula mA may be prepared by stage i of the aforementioned process of the present invention or by any method analogous to those known in the art, for example, one method comprises acylation or aroylation of a compound of formula V EMI13.1 wherein,Ar, R1, R3 and R4 are as defined for formula IIIA , with a suitable acid halide, acid anhydride or mixed anhydride. The reaction may be effected in an inert solvent, for example a halogenated hydrocarbon, at a temperature in the range of 0 1000, and optionally in the presence of a base, for example, an organic tertiary amine, or inorganic base or an excess of the pyrazoline of formula V . The compounds of formula IIIA may be used in the relief of rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatoid spondylitis, osteoarthritis, gouty arthritis and other arthritic conditions, inflamed joints, psoriasis, eczema, inflammatory eye conditions including conjuctivitis, pyresis and other conditions associated with inflammation and pain. Such other conditions associated with inflammation include the reduction of tissue necrosis in chronic inflammation, the suppression of tissue rejection following transplant surgery and ulcerative colitis.The compounds of formula IIIA may also be used in the treatment or prophylaxis of allergic conditions and airway inflammatory conditions such as asthma and of asthma having a non allergic origin and bronchitis. The compounds may also be useful as antispasmogenic agents.Thus the present invention further provides a compound of formula IIIA or a pharmacologically acceptable acid addition salt thereof for use in a method of inhibiting the lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase pathways of the arachidonic acid metabolism in a mammal such as man.
