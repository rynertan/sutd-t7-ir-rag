## Description
The present invention relates to a printing material set for preparing bar code labels by pressure sensitive printing, by which bar code labels utilized in the statistical treatment of data such as the names, prices and weights of commodities are simply prepared and utilized. Bar code labels have hitherto been prepared by transcription using sheets of ordinary paper and ink. In addition to this method, a method has been devised in which printing is effected using simplified printers fitted to carbon paper, heat sensitive paper or magnetic tape. However, according to the above mentioned printing system, for instance, in the method using ink, the hands of the printer operator are apt to become stained when changing the ink roller, printed images are apt to be uneven and special means are necessary to stabilize the printed image against friction. When using heat sensitive paper, because of the co existence of the colour developer and the colour coupler on the upper surface of the label even after printing, stains are apt to be caused by coloring due to post heating of the material. In the case of carbon paper, the transcribed pigment and wax are adhered onto the surface of the label. Accordingly, the distinctness of the image is deteriorated by heat and or friction. The above mentioned defects are causes of reduction of the accuracy with which the printed images are read. The reduction is particularly remarkable when printing the bar codes and attaching the printed labels onto articles. DE A 2407822 discloses a self adhesive record carrier, such as an adhesive label, composed of a base paper, an adhesive layer on the back, a non stick silicone layer or the like and a disposable backing sheet. Pressure sensitive microcapsules containing a colour former are provided together with a colour generating reagent layer. The base paper or the backing sheet of the adhesive label contains at least one of the two layers. The record carrier is described as for use in a factory. For example, an original carrier in front can be used as an order confirmation, the adhesive layer can be used as an information carrier for goods during the production sequence, storage and transport, and further duplicate carriers can be used for controlling production, storage and transport, as a consignment note or the like. There is no mention of bar code labels. The present invention provides a printing material set for preparing labels by pressure sensitive printing, comprising an adhesive label which comprises a base paper, an adhesive layer and a backing sheet and, on top, a carrier which comprises a base which carries a coating of micro capsules on its back, characterised in that the set comprises a a first, printing, tape comprising a plastic film as the base of the carrier, the micro capsules containing a dispersion of minute particles of a pigment in a solution of an adhesive component in an organic solvent and b a second tape as the backing sheet comprising a strippable tape on the upper surface of which, as the base paper, papers for bar code labels are removably attached by the adhesive, said printing tape a being superimposed on said tape b . The printing material set of the present invention overcomes the defects of bar code labels prepared by conventional methods. The present inventors have found that by using microcapsules containing a dispersion of minute particles of a pigment in a solution of an adhesive component in an organic solvent, while without using a colour developer, the reduction of the accuracy of reading the printed images of the bar code label is improved. The invention will be described with reference to Figures 1 to 3, in which The present invention also provides the use of a printing material set as defined above to prepare bar code labels. In use the first, printing, tape and the papers for bar code labels are pressed together such that those microcapsules which contact the papers for bar code labels break. The printing material set for preparing bar code labels according to the present invention includes i those in which the papers for bar code labels have been attached continuously at spaced intervals on the strippable tape and ii those in which paper for bar code labels having perforations at regular intervals is attached continuously to the strippable tape, for both printing at any time and attaching the bar code labels at any time to commodities. The present invention will be explained in more detail while referring to the drawings which show a printing material set according to the present invention. Figs. 1 and 3 show an enlarged vertical section of a printing material set according to the present invention, wherein a printing tape 6 comprises a plastic film 1 and micro capsules 2 containing the dispersion of minute particles of a pigment in a solution of an adhesive component in an organic solvent carried on the inside surface of the film 1 , the bar code label tape 7 comprises papers 3 for bar code labels and a strippable tape 5 , the papers 3 have the adhesive 4 on the undersurface thereof, the strippable tape 5 carries the papers 3 and is removably attached at predetermined intervals or with perforations to the adhesive 4 , and the printing tape 6 is superposed on the bar code label tape 7 . In pressure sensitive printing wherein the printing material set is used for forming bar codes clearly on the papers for bar code labels, it is necessary that the percussion pressure of the printer is large enough to uniformly break the microcapsules on the percussed part. For that purpose, the film carrying the microcapsules has a uniform thickness of, for instance, less than 30 µm, preferably from 6 to 20 µm. It is preferred that the printing tape itself is not broken by the percussion pressure of the printer. The microcapsules carried on the film can be produced by the method for producing microcapsules for use in conventional pressure sensitive recording papers EP A 0046415 . The size of the minute particles of pigment contained within the microcapsules is preferably less than 50 nm, particularly less than 30 nm. When the size is over 50 nm, the transfer of the minute particles of pigment from the microcapsules is not effected favorably, resulting in insufficient density of the coloured image. In addition, the content of the minute particles of pigment in the core material is preferably less than 25 by weight, more preferably 5 to 20 by weight, of the dispersion. Sufficient transfer of the minute particles of pigment from the microcapsules is not effected when the content is over 25 by weight. Minute particles of a pigment having a deep colour are preferably used minute particles of carbon are most preferred. The adhesive component which is contained within the microcapsules may be anything so long as it is soluble in an organic solvent and is able to adhere the minute particles of pigment transferred from the microcapsules after breaking thereof on the surface of the label. As the adhesive component, polystyrene, polyacrylates, polymethacrylates, low molecular polyethylene, ethylcellulose, natural rubber and chloroprene rubber may be exemplified. The weight ratio of the adhesive component to the minute particles of pigment is generally from 8 2 to 2 8. The adhesive component is generally contained in the range of from 1.5 to 30 by weight of the dispersion. A coloured dyestuff may be further contained in the microcapsules if necessary. As such a dyestuff, monoazo dyes, bisazo dyes, monoazo metal complex dyes, anthraquinone dyes, phthalocyanine dyes and triarylmethane dyes may be exemplified. The coloured dyestuff is generally contained in the range of from 0.15 to 10 by weight of the dispersion. As the organic solvent for dissolving the adhesive component and dyestuff, alkylbenzenes such as toluene and xylene, diarylmethanes, diarylethanes, alkylbiphenyls and alkylnaphthalenes may be, for example, mentioned. To carry the microcapsules on the inside surface of the film, for instance, a suspension of microcapsules in a latex is preferably coated on the inside surface of the film and dried. Any tape may be used as the strippable tape so far as the papers for bar code labels are attached removably to an adhesive. Although the papers for bar code labels include all papers for recording, coating paper, art paper and synthetic paper are preferably used. In addition, the strippable tape may be any base material so long as it is easily detachable from the adhesive carried on the undersurface of the papers for bar code labels. Accordingly, it does not necessarily mean a sheet of paper but also a sheet of plastic material. The adhesive is selected according to the material of the papers for bar code labels, and the strippable tape material may be selected according to the kind of adhesive. In order to print bar codes on the papers 3 using the superposed printing tape 6 , the printing is carried out by impressing a predetermined figure of bar codes on the upper surface of the printing tape 6 namely, the plastic film 1 with a percussion pressure, for example obtained by using a bar printer or dot printer. The printing of the bar codes on the surface of the paper for bar code labels is accomplished simultaneously with the impressing. As a result of rapid evaporation of the solvent for the adhesive component and dye stuff from the paper for bar code labels, the printed bar codes on the label are fixed in a stable state soon after the printing, are not stained even by friction and are maintained distinctly even after several months. The characteristic feature of the performance of the printing material set for preparing bar code labels according to the present invention is that the minute particles of a pigment dispersed in the solution of the adhesive component are released from the microcapsules which have been broken by the percussion pressure of printing, and rapidly adhere to the papers for bar code labels. After evaporation of the solvent, the minute particles of pigment adhere to the papers firmly and are maintained in a stable state. Accordingly, according to the present invention, the defects seen in conventional printing material sets for preparing bar code labels by pressure sensitive printing, such as staining, reduction of the distinctness of the printed bar code and stains due to friction, are profitably improved.
