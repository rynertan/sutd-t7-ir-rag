# Method for the production of endosseous implants.

## Abstract
An improved method for the production of endosseous implants which comprises thermally spraying a hydroxyapa tite containing powder onto the surface of a metallic core material, and treating the resultant product with an aqueous solution which does substantially not dissolve the hydroxy apatite but can dissolve calcium oxide and thereby dissolving out alkaline components. The endosseous implants of this invention show excellent mechanical properties and excellent affinity to the living body without hematolysis, and hence, are useful for the treatment or recovery of defective or lost bones, joints and tooth roots.
