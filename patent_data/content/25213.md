# Ultrasonic flaw detector.

## Abstract
An ultrasonic flaw detector 1 comprises a carriage 3 travelling on a guide rail 11 , a guide arm 5 extending in a direction traversing the travel direction of the carriage 3 and supported by the carriage 3 so as to swing in a plane traversing the travel direction of the carriage 3 , a probe holder 7 slidably supported by the arm 5 , and a probe 9 mounted on said probe holder 7 so as to swing about two axes traversing each other. One of the axes is generally in parallel to the travel direction of the carriage 3 . The carriage 3 is driven by a motor, and the probe 9 is moved by manual or motor driving operation in a direction traversing the travel direction of the carriage 3 while pressing the probe 9 on a surface to be inspected, whereby the probe 9 follow the surface wall enough even if the surface is curved.
