# Process for dehydrating aqueous lower alkanol mixtures.

## Abstract
Aqueous ethanol and other lower alkanol water mixtures may be dehydrated in the gas or liquid phase by using carbon molecular sieves. These sieves preferentially absorb water and recovery of absolute ethanol or other absolute alkanol is achieved. Absolute ethanol produced from this process may be used in the manufacture of gasohol.
