# LAC SACCHAROMYCES CEREVISIAE, PLASMIDS, PRODUCTION AND USE

## Abstract
The invention relates particularly to novel, transformed strains of Lac Saccharomyces cerevisiae, capable of utilizing lactose as a sole carbon source, produced by inserting into the Saccharomyces cerevisiae a plasmid containing a lactose per mease and a beta galactosidase gene derived from Kluyveromy ces lactis yeast.
