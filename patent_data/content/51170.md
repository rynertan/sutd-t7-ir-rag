# A sealing assembly including axial and radial lips and a labyrinth.

## Abstract
A two element sealing assembly comprises a first 5 and second 6 annular element each of which can be mounted on one of the said members 2, 4 and rigidly connected to it, the first 5 of the said annular elements being provided with at least one pair of annular lips 12, 13 of resiliently deformable material, a first 12 of which extends in a direction substantially parallel to the axis of the said first element 2 and a second 13 of which extends in a direction substantially radial to the said axis, and the second 6 of the said annular elements being provided with at least a first 20 and a second 21 sliding surface which can come into contact with the said first 12 and second 13 lip respectively when the said elements are mounted on associated rotating members 2, 4 , in such a way that between each of the said lips 12, 13 and the associated sliding surfaces 20, 21 there is transmitted a predetermined pressure for preventtng the passage of lubricant and con taminating substances between the said chamber and the external environment.
