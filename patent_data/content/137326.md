## Description
HEAT STABILIZED SWEETENER COMPOSITIONBackground of the Invention Aspartame l methyl N L a aspartyl L phenylalanine is a widely used sweetener. Its preparation and use are described in U. S. Patents 3,492,131 and 3,642,91. FDA regulations 21 CFR 172.804 c 3 provide that when aspartame is used as a sugar substitute for table use, its label shall bear instructions not to use in cooking or baking. This label warning was required by the FDA because aspartame was found to be unstable when heated.For example, aspartame would decompose in typical baking situations such as making cakes, cookies, breads.and the like. This invention solves the problem of aspartame s instability during baking. Brief Description of the Invention Aspartame, salts and metal complexes thereof are protected during the baking process by coating the sweetener with a partially hydrogenated vegetable oil. It is important that the aspartame, salts or metal complexes thereof and partially hydrogenated vegetable oil be formed into 8 40 standard mesh particle size, so that aspartame Standard mesh refers to standard screens which pass particles with diameters of 2308 microns for 8 mesh, 840 micron for 20 mesh, 20 micron for 40 mesh, 177 micron for 80 mesh. will be released in the later part of the baking cycle.Preferably an aspartarne sweetener is first granulated to 14 to 80 standard mesh sizes and most preferably to 14 to 30 standard mesh sizes and then are coated to form 8 to 40 standard mesh granules with a partially hydrogenated vegetable oil . Thus the invention encompasses a heat stable sweetening composition comprising 8 40 mesh particles containing aspartame, salt or metal complexes thereof and 30 90 by weight of partially hydrogenated vegetable oil melting above 1200F. The invention utilizes the principle that solid aspartame is significantly more stable than aspartame in solution. Coating with compatible fat will prevent aspartame from dissolving, thus stabilized, during preparation and baking. Both the type of the fat and the particle size of fat coated aspartame have been found to be critical. The melting point of the fat is also an important factor for both stabilizing aspartame in baking.and making a granular product. This principle is also applicable to other artificial sweeteners such as saccharin and acesulfame K and con0binations with aspartame. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF Tr.r INVENTION Aspartame l methyl N L o aspartyl L phenylalanine has the following chemical formulaEMI4.1 Salts of aspartame are also effective sweeteners of generally greater stability than aspartame itself.Typical salts are sulfate, and lower alkyl sulfonate wherein the lower alkyl group contains 1 4 carbon atoms.Preferred salts are Bis hydrogen aspartyl phenylalanine methyl ester sulfate represented by the formula APM.H 2SO4 hydrogen aspartyl phenylalanine methyl ester methyl sulfonate, represented by the formula APM H S03CH3 Metal complexes of aspartame are likewise more stable in the solid state than aspartame alone. Typical metal complexes are derived from pharmacological lv acceptable metal ions and anions. Typical metal ions are Ca ,Zn , Mg , Al , Fe and Fe and typical anions are chloride, acetate, sulfate, and phosphate. Preferred aspartyl phenylalanine methyl ester APM metal complexes are Mg APM 2C1 Fe APM 3C1 Al 2APM 3Cl Ca Ca APM 2C1 Zn APM 2C1 It has been found that aspartame its salts and metal complexes can be protected by fats during the baking cycle, particularly by partially hydrogenated vegetable oils melting above 1200F. Partially hydrogenated triglyceride vegetable oils such as soybean, palm, cottonseed oils melting above 1200F are preferred fats useful in practicing the invention.Typically about 3 9 parts by weight of fat are used to coat 7 1 parts by weight of APM, its salts or metal complexes. The APM, its salt or metal complex is coated with fat by either melting the fat and adding APM or by intermixingAPM and fat prior to melting the fat. The fat is allowed to harden and the mass of fat coated particles is filtered through standard mesh screen to obtain fat coated APM particles in the size range of 8 40 standard mesh or about 2380 to 420 microns. An ideal coating is not only compatible with aspartame but also has a melting point about 1000C to release aspartame until the end of baking cycle. However, a mechanism other than melting fat is needed to slow down the release of aspartame during baking. This can be accomplished by increasing fat coating thickness and or the particle size of the baking product to increase the diffusing time of the melted fat into the matrix of cake. Therefore, particle size is important because it provides controlled release of APM at the end of the baking cycle. If the particle size is too small, the APM will be released early in the baking cycle and will be thermally decomposed. If the particle size is too large, sweetness will not be thoroughly released and distributed. Therefore, the particle size, the type and the melting pint of the fat are critical. It has been found advantageous to include acidic polydextrose with the APM during the fat coating process when the product will be used to sweeten baked goods with high pH environment such as a chocolate cake. The polydextrose is in the amount of 3 to 8 parts of APM. The invention is further illustrated by the following examples which are intended to illustrate the invention and not limit it in spirit and scope. Example 1 Granule PreparationMethod I 30 parts of partially hydrogenated triglyceride soy bean oil melting at 151 1580F is melted in a flat bottom pan. 10 parts of aspartame APM is gradually added so the powder is coated by the melted oil. Heating is discontinued and 60 parts of polydextrose powder is dispersed in the melted oil by stirring. The mass is stirred during solidification to produce small granules.The granules are separated on a standard 20 mesh screen.This method is applicable when using 10 30 parts of fat. Method II Polydextrose aspartame non porous granules a are made by adding a solution of 400 parts of polydextrose dissolved in 150 parts by volume of hot water to 600 parts of aspartame with stirring and drying by heating until substantially dry granules are formed. The granules are passed through a 30 standard mesh screen. Method III 3 parts of APM and 2 parts of polydextrose were mixed and granulated in a high speed stirring granulator using water 6 10 by weight granulation solvent and heat to facilitate granulation. The granules were tray dried and screened to la 30 mesh size distribution. The above granule was coated with 50 Duratex using a fluid bed granulator which has a heating and pumping system to melt and spray high melting point fats. Part of the coated granules were screened to 12 30 mesh and 16 30 mesh samples. a The porous granules were prepared by mixing APM with granulating compounds, such as polydextrose or maltrin M100, and water or water alcohol mixture to make a dough, which was expanded and dried in vacuum oven at 8O0C. The dried product was then milled to granular powder. These granules are coated with fat by mixing SO parts of the granules with 50 parts of fine powder fat and slowly heating with stirring until the granules are coated. The coated granules are passed through both 10 and 20 standard mesh screen. Both Methods I, II and III are applicable when no polydextrose is used. For example, aspartame may itself by granulated or mixed with other granulating agents. The heat stabilized compositions of the present invention may be utilized as in one or more of the following Examples.

ExamDle 3 Compatibility between different types of fats and APM compounds. The following results were obtained by the analysis of fat coated samples. Unheated samples were used as controls to determine high temperature compatibility. For all samples the weight ratio used was 9 1 fat APM compound . The samples were heated at 1100C for 0 minutes. APM was extracted from a fat coated sample using solvent solvent 0.01 N HCl methylene chloride extraction and determined by an High Performance LiquidChromatographic EPIC method.

Example 4 Temperature profiles of cakes during baking. The temperature inside of a cake during baking was monitored and recorded every minute using a thermocouple inside the cake. Results show that at the end of 40 minutes baking period the cake temperature plateaus at 112 1200C. Therefore, the maximum temperature of a baking cake is significantly lower than the degradation temperatures ofAPM 1600C , APM H 2S04 1800C , and APMCaCl2 1750C in solid form. Therefore, if these sweeteners can be kept in solid form, e.g., by fat coating to prevent them from dissolving in water, they are stabilized during baking.
