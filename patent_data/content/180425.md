# A PROCESS FOR SEPARATING ETHYLEBENZENE FROM XYLENES BY SELECTIVE ADSORPTION ON A CESIUM SUBSTITUTED X ZEOLITE

## Abstract
The invention relates to a process for selectively adsorbing ethylbenzene from a stream containing one or more isomeric xylenes. The ethylbenzene is adsorbed on Cs substituted Type X zeolite. Certain alkyl substituted benzene desorbents give the zeolite good ethylbenzene selectivity over the xylenes.
