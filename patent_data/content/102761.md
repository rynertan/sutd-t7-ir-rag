## Description
SINTERED SPHERICAL PELLETS USEFUL AS GAS AND OIL WELL PROPPANTS, PRODUCTION AND USE THEREOF This invention relates to sintered spherical pellets useful as gas and oil well proppants and to the production and use thereof. Oil and natural gas are produced from wells having porous and permeable subterranean formations. The porosity of the formation permits the formation to store oil and gas and the permeability of the formation permits the oil or gas fluid to move through the formation.Permeability of the formation is essential to permit oil and gas to flow to a location where it may be pumped from the well. Sometimes the permeability of the formation holding the gas or oil is insufficient for economic recovery of oil and gas. In other cases, during operation of the well, the permeability of the formation drops to the extent that further recovery becomes uneconomic. In such cases, it is necessary to fracture the formation and prop the fracture in an open condition by means of a proppant material or propping agent.Such fracturing is usually accomplished by hydraulic pressure and the proppant material or propping agent is a particulate material, such as sand, glass beads or ceramic particles, which are carried into the fracture by means of a fluid. Spherical particles of uniform size are generally acknowledged to be the most effective proppants due to maximised permeability. For this reason, assuming other properties to be equal, spherical or essentially spherical proppants, such as rounded sand grains, metallic shot, glass beads and tabular alumina, are preferred. In practice, in deep wells, where high pressures 2 are encountered. e.g. above 700 Kg cm 10,000 psi , the above mentioned proppants are either entirely ineffective or do not exhibit desired permeability. Examples of prior art proppants and the use thereof may be found inU.S. Patent Nos. 2,950,247 3,026,938 3,126,056 3,497,008 3,976,138 and 4,068,718. One of the better proppants useful at high pressures, disclosed in US. Patent No. 3,976,138, is alumina. However, even alumina, as disclosed therein has reduced permeability at pressures in excess of 350 Kg cm2 5,000 psi . As disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,068,718, sintered bauxite unexpectedly has a permeability which is superior to the previously mentioned proppant materials 2 at pressures as high as 700 Kg cm 10,000 psi or even higher. Unfortunately, the sintered bauxite material actually used in making the measurements disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,068,718 does not have a desired spherical shape, which would provide high permeability. The prior art sintered bauxite particles may be produced in spherical shape as described in USSN 252,491. However, such proppants, although extremely useful under high pressure conditions, in excess of 700 kg cm2 10,000 psi , are costly. The cost of the prior art sintered bauxite proppant for wells of inter 2 mediate pressures, from 350 to 700 Kg cm from 5,000 to 10,000 psi , may not be economically justified. The present invention provides proppants aptly suited to use under pressures of up to 700 Kg cm2 10,000 psi , which are more economic and have lower specific gravities and bulk densities, which would benefit the user, in that fewer kilograms of proppant per cubic metre of fracture would b required. Handling, e.g. pumping of slurries of lower density material, is also made easier. In accordance with the present invention, composite, spherical pellets or particles containing clay as a major component, having an alumina to silica dry weight basis ratio from 9 1 to 1 1 and apparent specific gravities less than 3.40 are produced. Diaspore clay, burley clay and flint clay have been found to be particularly useful in the production of such pellets, although it is believed that other clays may be employed. Such spherical particles are useful as oil and gas well proppants. The present calcined clay materials are particularly adapted for use in combination with known proppant materials, for example bauxite or alumina, to produce composite sinterable, spherical pellets which are subsequently furnaced to produce sintered, spherical pellets eminently useful as proppants. The composites according to the present invention contain a major portion, more preferably greater than 40 percent, by weight, of clay.Diaspore clay is preferred and combinations containing up t6 95 percent, by weight, diaspore clay are useful. The clay materials according to the present invention are compatible with and may be used as a matrix for a wide variety of proppant materials and, in this manner, a wide variety of composite proppants may be produced, which may be customised to particular conditions or formations. Thus, the properties of the final sintered composite pellets, such as strength, permeability, specific gravity, bulk density and acid resistance, may be controlled by variations in the initial component mixture. Combinations of diaspore clay and bauxite are particularly useful. Such mixtures may suitably contain up to 95 percent, by weight, clay. Mixtures containing up to 80 percent, by weight, clay have a broad range of use and mixtures containing from 50 to 60 percent, by weight, clay have a particularly broad range of use. The present invention also provides a process for propping fractures in oil and gas wells at depths of from 7,000 to 14,000 feet from 2134 to 4268 m utilising the present sintered pellets by mixing the pellets with a fluid, such as oil or water, and introducing the mixture into a fracture in a subterranean formation. The compaction pressure upon the fracture is generally at least 280 Kg cm2 4,000 psi and is usually from 350 to 700 Kg cm2 from 5,000 to 10,000 psi . The present pellets have an average particle size of from 0.1 to 2.5 millimetres.It has been found that the present composite pellets containing 50 percent or more parts, by weight, clay, at pressures up to 700 Kg cm2 10,000 psi , have desirable permeability characteristics, i.e. they exhibit a permeability to brine at about 93.30C 2000F which decreases not more than about 75 when the pressure applied to them is Kg cm2 increased from 140 to 700 from 2,000 to 10,000 psi The present proppant materials are produced by forming a mixture comprised of clay with a material, such as bauxite or alumina. The starting ingredients have an average particle size of less then 15 microns 0.015 mm , preferably less than 10 microns 0.01 mm , most preferably less than 5 microns 0.005 mm . In a preferred method, the mixture is produced on an intensive mixer having a rotatable table provided with a rotatable impacting impeller, such as described in U.S. Patent No. 3,690,622. Sufficient water is added to cause essentially spherical ceramic pellets to form and, after such pellets have formed, from 5 to 15 percent, by weight of pellets, of additional ceramic powder is added and the mixer is further operated to cause accretion of the added material to the pellets being formed. The resulting pellets are then dried at from 100 to 3000C and furnaced at sintering temperature until an apparent specific gravity of from 2.70 to 3.40 is obtained, depending on the composition of the starting mixture. The sintered composite proppant pellets according to the present invention have apparent specific gravities of less than 3.40 and are spherical in shape. The sphericity of the pellets may be determined using a visual comparator. Krumbein and Sloss, Stratigraphy and Sedimentation, second edition, 1955,W. H. Freeman Co., San Francisco, CA, U.S.A., describes a chart for use in visual determination of sphericity and roundness. Visual comparis on using this chart is a widely used method of evaluating sphericity or roundness of particles. In using the visual comparison method, a random sample of from 10 to 20 particles of the material to be tested is selected. The particles are viewed under a from 10 to 20 power microscope or a photomicrograph and the shapes thereof compared to theKrumbein and Sloss chart. The chart values for sphericity range from 0.3 to 0.9. The chart values for the individual particles are then averaged to obtain a sphericity value.The present particles have an average sphericity of 0.8 or greater when visually compared with the Krumbein and Sloss chart. Spherical and related forms, as used herein, is intended to mean an average ratio of minimum diameter to maximum diameter of 0.80 or greater or having an average sphericity value of 0.8 or greater compared to a Krumbein and Sloss chart. Bulk density , as used herein, is the weight per unit volume, including in the volume considered, the void spaces between the particles. Apparent specific gravity is a dimension less number, numerically equal to the weight in grams per cubic centimetre of volume, excluding void space or open porosity in determining the volume. The apparent specific gravity values given herein were determined by liquid ethyl benzene displacement. Theoretical density and true specific gravity exclude not only the void space between particles and open porosity of particles from the volume, but also exclude closed porosity. These latter two measures are not customarily used for characterising proppants.Theoretical density and true specific gravity require fine grinding to expose closed porosity. Unless otherwise indicated, all percentages, proportions and values with respect to composition are expressed in terms of weight. The sintered, spherical pellets according to the present invention may be produced by furnacing a composite clay mixture. Various sintering aids may be incorporated with the starting mixture, for example, minor amounts of bentonite clay or iron oxide, boron, boron carbide, aluminium diboride, boron nitride, boron phosphide and other boron compounds. If sintering aids are used, generally up to 30 weight percent are found useful. The most desirable range of sintering aid may be readily determined by those skilled in the art, depending upon the particular clay mixture used. Fluxes, such as sodium carbonate, lithium carbonate, feldspar, manganese oxide, titania, iron oxide and sodium silicates, up to 30 weight percent, may be added to aid sintering.If desired, a binder, for example various resins or waxes known in the prior art, may be added to the initial mixture to improve pelletising and to increase the green strength of the unsintered pellets. Pellets according to the present invention and for use in accordance with the present invention may be prepared from a mixture of the clays described in Table 1 below with bauxite or alumina or mixtures of these. The composition of the specific bauxite employed in the production of the pellets described herein is also given in Table 1. All values in Table 1 are expressed as percentages, by weight. Where an omission occurs, it indicates that insufficient testing was conducted to obtain a value.

The surinam bauxite described in Table 1 may be obtained from Aluminum Company of America, Pittsburgh,Pennysylvania 15219, U.S.A. Surinam bauxite is so designated for that is the country in which it is mined. It is expected that other bauxites may be substituted. Diaspore clays, as found in nature, are predominantly hydrated aluminium oxide A1203 H2O . Such clays occur in emery rock in association with corundum.The main deposits of diaspore clays in the United States of America are in Missouri and Pennysylvania. Diaspore clays have a hardness of from 6.5 to 7.0 and a true 3 specific gravity usually from 3.30 to 3 45 gm cm . The crystal structure of diaspore clay is orthorhombic.Typically, diaspore clay, as found in nature, contains from 25 to 30 percent, by weight, and, in some cases, as high as 35 percent, by weight, of impurities. Generally, the major impurities are SiO2, which is typically from 12 to 25 percent, by weight TiO2 which is typically from 2.75 to 3.75 percent Fe 203 which is typically from 0.25 to 1.0 percent and MgO and CaO, which are generally less than 1.0 percent. The clay materials for use in accordance with the present invention are initially calcined by known methods at temperatures sufficiently high for periods sufficiently long to remove organic material and substantially to remove water of hydration. The sintered, spherical pellets according to the present invention are preferably produced as follows 1 Starting ingredients of calcined clay and alumina, bauxite, or mixtures thereof, are added in a predetermined ratio to a high intensity mixer. At least 40 percent of the total ingredients on a dry weight basis is clay. Each of the ceramic ingredients has an average particle size of less than 15 microns 0.015 mm , preferably less than 10 microns 0.01 mm , most.preferably less than 5 microns 0.005 mm . The small particle size is required in order to obtain a finished spherical sintered pellet having the desired density. An average particle size of smaller then 5 microns 0.005 mm is desirable and the average particle size is most preferably below 3 microns 0.003 mm and usually above 0.5 microns 0.0005 mm . 2 The powdered ceramic starting ingredients are stirred to form a dry homogeneous particulate mixture having an average particle size of less than 15 microns 0.015 mm . A preferred stirring or mixing device is that obtainable fromEirich Machines, Inc., known as theEirich Mixer. A mixer of this type is provided with a horizontal or inclined circular table, which may be made to rotate at a speed of from 10 to 60 revolutions per minute rpm , and is provided with a rotatable impacting impeller, which may be made to rotate at a tip speed of from 5 to 50 metres per second. The direction of rotation of the table is opposite that of the impeller, causing material added to the mixer to flow over itself in counter current manner. The central axis of the impacting impeller is generally located within the mixer at a position off centre from the central axis of the rotatable table. The table may be in a horizontal or inclined position, wherein the incline, if any, is from 0 to 35 degrees from the horizontal. 3 While the mixture is being stirred, there is added sufficient water to cause formation of composite, spherical pellets from the ceramic powder mixture. In general, the total quantity of water which is sufficient to cause essentially spherical pellets to form is from 17 to 20 percent, by weight, of the initial starting ceramic ingredients and is usually from 18 to 20 percent, by weight, of the initial starting ceramic ingredients and is usually from 18 to 20 percent, by weight, of the initial ceramic powder. The total mixing time is usually from 2 to 6 minutes. After the clay mixture is added to the mixer,.the table is rotated at from 10 to 60 rpm, preferably from 20 to 40 rpm, and the impacting impeller is rotated to obtain a tip speed of from 25 to 50 metres, per second, preferably from 25 to 35 metres per second, and sufficient water is added to cause essentially spherical pellets of the desired size to form. If desired, the impeller may be initially rotated at from 5 to 20 metres per second during addition of half of the required water and subsequently rotated at the higher tip speed of from 25 to 50 metres per second during the addition of the balance of the water. The rate of water addition is not critical. The intense mixing action quickly disperses the water throughout the particles. 4 The resulting pellets are dried at a temperature of from 100 to 3000C from 212 to 5720F until preferably less than 3 percent, most preferably less than 1 percent, moisture remains in the pellets. The most preferred drying temperature is from 175 to 275 from 347 to 527 OF and the drying time is usually from 30 to 60 minutes. 5 The dried pellets are then furnaced at sintering temperature for a period sufficient to enable recovery of sintered, spherical pellets having an apparent specific gravity of from 2.70 to 3.40 and a bulk density of from 1.35 to 1.80 grams per cubic centimetre. The specific time and temperature to be employed is, of course dependent on the starting ingredients and is determined empirically according to the results of physical testing of pellets after furnacing. The furnacing step is carried out to sinter the composite pellets. Generally, temperatures of from 1350 to 15500C from 2462 to 28220F for from 4 to 20 minutes, more preferably from 1485 to 15150C from 2705 to 27590F for from 4 to 8 minutes, are useful, depending upon the sintering aids and fluxes which may be included. While the above described process will yield pe llets according to the present invention, it is preferred that from 5 to 15 percent, preferably from 8 to 10 percent, of additional starting ingredients, by weight of pellets, be added, after the addition of water, but prior to drying of the pellets. The added material is of the same composition as that described in step 1 .The addition of more dry ceramic powder is followed by rotating the impeller at a tip speed of from 5 to 20 metres per second, preferably from 10 to 20 metres per second, for from 1 to 6 minutes, while continuing to rotate the table at from 10 to 60 rpm, preferably from 20 to 40 rpm. This step improves yield and results in improved sphericity of the pellets. If desired, the rotation of the impeller may then be stopped while the table continues to rotate from 1 to 5 minutes. The impacting impeller is preferably a disc provided with peripheral rods or bars attached to the disc. The longitudinal axis of the rods or bars is desirably essentially parallel with the axis of rotation of the impeller, which is usually a vertical axis. The diameter of the impeller is measured from the axis of rotation to the centre of the most distant rod or bar.Tip speed is the speed of the most distant rod or bar. The diameter of the impeller depends upon the size of the mixer, but is usually less than 25 percent of the diameter of the mixer. The impeller in most applications is from 10 to 100 centimetres in diameter and usually rotates at from 200 to 3750 rpm at the lower tip speeds of from 10 to 20 metres per second, depending upon impeller diameter, and at from 500 to 6500 rpm at the higher tip speeds of from 25 to 35 metres per second, depending upon impeller diameter. The pellets are screened for size, preferably after drying. However, they may be screened before drying or after furnacing. The rejected over sized and under sized pellets and powdered material obtained after the drying and screening steps may be recycled.The finished pellets may be tumbled to enhance smoothness. The resultant sintered pellets have a bulk density of from 1.35 to 1.85 grams per cubic centimetre, depending upon the ceramic starting ingredients employed. The overall particle size sf the pellets for use as propping agent for increasing permeability in a subterranean formation penetration by a well is from 0.1 to 2.5 millimetres, pre ferably from 0.15 to 1.7 millimetres. In Table 2 below is summarised the composition for several pellets according to the present invention produced from the raw material indicated. Also given are the results of testing of these pellets. Unless otherwise indicated, parts and percentages are by weight.All samples were prepared in accordance with the procedures given herein. Example 1 gives in detail the procedure employed in the preparation of Sample No. 2, which procedure is typical of that employed in preparation of the remainder of the samples reported inTable 2.

The particle size distribution of the pellets was 20 x 40 mesh U.S. Standard Sieve 90 percent, by weight, minimum of pellets will pass through 20 mesh 841 micron, 0.841 mm screen, but not through 40 mesh 420 micron, 0.42 mm screen . Values obtained using the American PetroleumInstitute API procedure for determining resistance to crushing are also reported in Table 2. According to this procedure, a bed of about 6 mm depth of sample to be tested is placed in a hollow cylindrical cell. A piston is inserted in the cell. Thereafter, a load is applied to the sample via the piston. 1 minute is taken to reach maximum load which is then held for 2 minutes. The load is thereafter removed, the sample removed from the cell and screened to separate crushed material. The results are reported as a percentage, by weight, of the original sample. Acid solubility of the samples reported inTable 2 was tested in accordance with recommended API test procedure, fourth draft, June 1980. In this procedure, a known weight of sample 5g is placed in 150 ml polyethylene beaker containing 100 ml of 12 3 HC1 HF acid The sample acid containing beaker is then placed in a 65.60C 1500F water bath for from 30 to 35 minutes. The sample is not stirred. The sample is thereafter filtered through a previously weighed filter crucible or funnel and washed three times with 20 ml portions of distilled water. The filtered and washed sample is thereafter dried to constant weight approximately 1 hour at 1050C 2200F . The values given inTable 2 represent the percentage of weight lost or dissolved due to the acid. Sphericity of the pellets reported in Table 2 was determined using a Krumbein and Sloss chart. The values reported represent an average of from 10 to 20 pellets per sample. Roundness as reported in Table 2 is a measure of the relative sharpness of the pellet corners or of curvature. This evaluation may be done at the same time and on the same sample as that used for sphericity.The pellets are visually compared with a Krumbein andSloss chart. The values reported represent an average of from 10 to 20 pellets per sample. Bulk density values reported in Table 2 were determined by weighing that amount of sample that would fill a cup of known volume. EXAMPLE 1 About 81 kilograms of diaspore clay material that had been previously calcined at a temperature sufficiently high to remove organic materials and substantially all of the water of hydration from the clay, together with about 54 kilograms of bauxite 60t, by weight, clay powder having an average particle size of from 4 to 8 microns from 0.004 to 0.008 mm were added to an Eirich mixer having a table diameter of about 115 centimetres, an operating capacity of about 160 kilograms and an impacting impeller diameter of about 27 centimetres. Whe table was rotated at about 35 rpm and the impeller was rotated at about 1090 rpm, and about 27 kilograms of water was added. Rotation of the table and impeller was continued for about 1 minute subsequently, the impeller speed was increased to about 2175 rpm. The table and impeller were rotated until seed pellets were formed, less than 5 percent of which were of a size smaller than 0.50 mm about 3 minutes .The impeller was then reduced to about 1090 rpm and about 4.08 kilograms of the initial diaspore clay bauxite powder mixture was added. Rotation of the pan and impeller was then continued for an additional 2 minutes to form spherical pellets. The pellets were then dried for about 20 minutes at about 1100C 2300F in a rotary dryer and then fired at about 15000C 27320F for about 5 minutes.The yield of useful pellets having a size of from 150 to 1700 microns from 0.05.to 1.7 millimetres was greater than 90 percent, by weight, of starting ceramic powder.The resulting pellets had an apparent specific gravity of about 3.25, a bulk density of 1.79 gm cm3 and a sphericity of greater than 0.8, as determined using theKrumbein and Sloss chart. The permeability in darcies of the pellets like Sample 2 was determined in 2 KC1 solution at 93.30C 2000F at various applied pressures. The results are shown in Table 3 below.

The amount of pressure required to induce various fixed amounts of compaction was measured.The results are shown in Table 4 below.

Pellets according to the present invention are presently believed to be particularly suitable for use at depths greater than 7,000 feet 2134 m , but less that 14,000 feet 4268 m . When used as a propping agent, the pellets according to the present invention may be handled in the same manner as other propping agents. The pellets may be delivered to the well site in bags or in bulk form along with the other materials used in fracturing treatment. Conventional equipment and techniques may be used to place the spherical pellets as propping agent. A viscous fluid, frequently referred to as pad, is injected into the well at a rate and pressure to initiate and propagate a fracture in the subterranean formation. The fracturing fluid may be an oil base, water base, acid, emulsion, foam, or other fluid. Injection of the fracturing fluid is continued until a fracture of sufficient geometry is obtained to permit placement of the propping pellets. Thereafter, the pellets are placed in the fracture by injecting into the fracture a fluid into which the pellets have previously been introduced and suspended. The propping distribution is usually a multi layer pack. The overall particle size of the pellets is from 0.1 to 2.5 millimetres, more preferably from 0.15 to 1.7 millimetres. Following placement of the pellets, the well is shut in for a period sufficient to permit the pressure in the fracture to bleed off into the formation. This causes the fracture to close and apply pressure on the propping pellets which resist further closure of the fracture.
