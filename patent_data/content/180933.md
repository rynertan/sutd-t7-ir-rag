# Process for preparing oxygen containing organic compounds.

## Abstract
A process for preparing oxygen containing organic com pounds from synthesis gas which comrpises contacting the synthesis gas with a solid catalyst prepared by the steps of mixing A a copper compound, B a nickel compound and C a zinc compound calcining the mixture, mixing the calcined product with D a potassium compound and then reducing the resulting mixture. The selectivity of alcohols such as ethanol and propanol is high in the process of the present invention. The catalyst of the present invention can be used effectively over long periods of time, since the dissipation of the nickel compo nent in the catalyst during the reaction is decreased.
