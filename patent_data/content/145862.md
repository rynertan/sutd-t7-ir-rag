# Metallization of a ceramic substrate.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a method of selectively metallizing a ceramic substrate 10 provided with a metallization pat tern 14 according by photoresist processing. A first layer 19 of photoresist is blanket deposited over the substrate, exposed through a coarse block out mask 20 , and devel oped in order to protect those regions of the metallization pattern not to be covered with metal. A blanket layer 21 of metal such as gold is then formed over the entire substrate surface. A second layer 22 of photoresist is deposited, exposed through a customized mask of the metallization pattern 23 , and developed. The exposed metal is etched and the remaining first and second photoresist layers are removed, leaving a coating of metal only at desired loca tions, say the engineering change pads 16 . The method may be used for the heavy gold deposition over the engineering change pads used as a standard in multilayer ceramic substrates.
