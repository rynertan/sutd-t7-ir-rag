# Production of a cross bonded starch.

## Abstract
Cross bonded starch is made by a process which com prises pretreating the starch with hydrogen peroxide and then reacting the pretreated starch with a mixture of acetic an hydride and adipic acid. By pretreating the starch with hydro gen peroxide before reaction with the acetic anhydride adipic acid mixture, the cross bonding effect of a given quantity of adipic acid is increased. Cross bonded starch is used as a thickener in food compositions.

## Description
Production of a Cross Bonded StarchThe present Invention relates to a method of production of a cross bonded starch using an aliphatic dibasic acid, in particular, adipic acid as the cross bonding agent.Cross bonded starch in which the starch has been reacted with adipic acid and acetic anhydride to provide adipyl groups as the cross bonding agent is known as acetylated di starch adipate and is used as a thickener in food compositions. The conventional method of producing the product involves the reaction of the starch with a mixture of adipic acid and acetic anhydride in an aqueous reaction medium followed by washing and drying the product. These crossbonded products have the necessary resistance to heat, acid and or shear conditions which may be encountered in processing or application of the starch containing food.The extent of cross bonding, and hence the performance of the product is dependent, all other factors being equal, on the amount of adipic acid used in the reaction but the amount of the latter which may be employed is strictly controlled by current food regulations. Any technique, therefore, which can increase the cross bonding effect of a given amount of adipic acid is commercially advantageous. We have now found that a pretreat ent of the starch with hydrogen peroxide before reaction with the acetic anhydride adipic acid mixture unexpectedly increases the apparent cross bonding effect of a given quantity of adipic acid. The use of hydrogen peroxide in the treatment of starch is well known a bleaching or oxidising agent and for this use it is sanctioned by t food regulations. It has also been proposed in U.S. Patent 3 557 091 an additive in the production of acetylated starch where low levels o hydrogen peroxide with ferrous salts are said to lower the swelling temperature of the product without causing sigificant degradation of starch polymer.Another use of hydrogen peroxide in starch technology is said to be t stabilisation of a starch paste on storage U.S. Patent 3 356 531 the amount of hydrogen peroxide used being 0.45 based on the starch.Hydrogen peroxide has also been recommended in U.S. Patent 3 655 644 a a thinning agent for starch derivatives, for example, in a process in which starch is reacted with ethylene oxide to give hydroxy ethyl star or with acetic anhydride to give acetylated starch. The starch is treated either before or after the reaction with hydrogen peroxide and copper salt, any residual hydrogen peroxide being removed by treatment with a reducing agent. The aim of this process is to produce starch derivatives of high fluidity.Accordingly, the present invention is a process for cross bonding star by reacting the starch with a mixture of acetic anhydride and adipic acid, in which prior to the reaction, the starch is treated with hydrogen peroxide. Any starch may be used in the production of the cross bonded product tuber or grain starches e.g. maize, waxy maize, potato or wheat starches being widely used. Waxy maize starch is particularly preferred. The amount of hydrogen peroxide used is preferably up to 0.45t based on the dry starch weight, more preferably 0.03 to 0.3x. The treatment of the starch with the hydrogen peroxide is suitably carried sut at a temperature in the range 0 to 60 C, particularly 20 to 500C, the starch being in the form of an aqueous slurry and the hydrogen peroxide in aqueous solution e.g. a 30X aqueous solution. The reaction need not be prolonged as it takes place very rapidly in a matter of a few minutes.Following the treatment with hydrogen peroxide, the reaction with adipic acid and acetic anhydride may be carried out directly. The pH of the starch slurry is first preferably adjusted so that it lies in the range 6 to 10 conveniently by the addition of an alkali e.g. sodium hydroxide solution. The amount of adipic acid is generally up to 0.12t of the starch dry weight and the acetic anhydride up to 10 , preferably 3t to 7.5X, again based on the starch dry weight. The reaction is carried out at a temperature which may lie in the range 200 to 600C and throughout the reaction the pH is maintained ia the range 7 to 9, preferably 8 to 8.5 by the addition of an alkali such as sodium hydroxide.The reaction time is usually 0.5 to 2 hours, particularly 0.5 to 1 hour and at the end of the reaction, the pH of the slurry is reduced to about 5.5 by the addition of an acid e.g. hydrochloric acid and the solid product separated from the liquid e.g. by centrifuging and finally washed and dried.Local food Jaws may prescribe different permissible amounts of bound adipyl groups based on the starch and, for acetylated.distarch adipate produced in Holland, the figure is 900 ppm based on starch dry weight.As may be seen from the following Examples, particularly Examples 6 and 7, a product prepared according to the process of the present invention and containing 512 ppm adipyl groups, shows equivalent if not better properties than one prepared in the conventional manner and containing 1993 ppm adipyl groups. The properties in question are shear stability acid stability and heat stability which are all improved by increased cross bonding.The adipyl contents of the acetylated di starch adipates were determined by the method described by G.A. Mitchell et al. Journal of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists 65 No.2 1982 . The other properties were determined as follows Heat Stability Viscosity ratio of a 5Z starch paste after heating for 30 minutes at 121 C to the original viscosity.Shear Stability Ratio of the viscosity after shearing a 4X d.s. starch paste at 4000 r.p.z. 5 minutes at 800C to the original viscosity.Acid Stability Ratio of the viscosity of starch paste 5Z d.s. after adjustment of pH to 2.5 with Citric Acid to original viscosity. Method of Preparation of the Cross bonded StarchA slurry Ã²f starch at 20 22 Be was treated at 20 400C with varying mounts of hydrogen peroxide as a 30 aqueous solution. The pH of the slurry was then adjusted to 8.0 to 8.5 by the addition of sodium hydroxide and a mixture of adipic acid and acetic anhydride added. The reaction was allowed to proceed at the same temperature for a period of 45 minutes to 1 hour with the continuous addition of sodium hydroxide to maintain the pH at 8.0 to 8.5. At the end of the reaction, the slurry pH was adjusted to 5.5 by addition of hydrochloric acid, the product separated by centrifuging, washed and flash dried. The shear stability 400 rpm for 5 minutes , acid stability pH 2.5 and temperature stability 120 C for 30 minutes were then measured. The results were as followsExample 1 Hydrogen Adipic Acetic Shear Acid Heat Peroxide Acid Anhydride Stability Stability Stability a 0 0.2 7.5Z 0.95 1.0 1.05 b 1500ppm 0.2Z 7.5 7.0 1.96 1.70Example 2 a 0 0 0.2Z 7.5 0.95 1.0 1.05 b 500ppm 0.1 7.5 0.96 0.91 0.94 c .lOOOppm 0.124 7.5Z 1.2 1.26 1.20 Example 1 demostrates the improvement obtained with hydrogen peroxide treatment, all other factors being equal.Example 2 shows that by using hydrogen peroxide treatment, equivalent or improved performance is obtained using less adipic acid.In a further pair of examples the adipyl contents of the starch products were determined for a product prepared according to the invention and one prepared according to conventional practice but from an increased amount of adipic acid. The critical properties of the products were as followsExample 3 Pretreatent with Adipyl Shear Acid Heat hydrogen peroxide Content Stability Stability Stability a None 1993 7 1.66 1.55 b 1500ppm 512 7 1.96 1.70Example 3 shows that hydrogen peroxide pretreatment provides product which has equivalent properties to one which contains aLmost four times the amount of adipyl groups but which has not been subjected to the pretreatment. Example 4 repeated the conditions of Example 1 but used an increased amount of hydrogen peroxide in comparison with an identical experinent in which no hydrogen peroxide was used.
