# Multiple access communication on a CATV reverse channel.

## Abstract
A multiple access communications system links a plural ity of geographically dispersed subscriber locations each of which including a transmitter and receiver with a central location also including a transmitter and receiver . Multiple access communication is required in the direction from the subscriber transmitters 100 to the central receiver 48 . In order to maintain stability, a subscriber transmitter which unsuccessfully transmits due to a collision with a transmis sion from another subscriber will retransmit. Multiple succeeding unsuccessful transmissions at any subscriber result at that subscriber in increasingly longer delays between successive transmissions.
