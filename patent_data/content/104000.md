# COMPOSITIONS AND THEIR USE IN THE PRODUCTION OF DENTAL RESTORATIONS

## Abstract
Wear resistant, high compressive strength permanent dental restorations may be prepared from compositions comprising a liquid monomer system comprising monoethylenically unsaturated monomer and polyethyleni cally unsaturated monomer, b a solid particulate system insoluble in the liquid monomer system a comprised of a mixture of organic and inorganic particulate substances, and c a free radical initiator system.
