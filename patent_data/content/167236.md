# Mineral cutting device, water supply lance and cutter pick.

## Abstract
A mineral cutting device comprising a plurality of replaceable picks 10, 10A 10G and associated water conveying lances 20, 20A 20G , each lance being tubular and having a hollow, water conveying interior and being contained, at least partially, within a bore 13, 13A, 13B in the pick 10, 10A 10G when the pick 10, 10A 10G has been mounted on the device 1, 1A, 1B , and each lance 20, 20A 20G terminating at or adjacent the end of the bore, at a water discharge orifice 23 . The invention also includes a lance for use with the mineral cutting device defined above, the lance 20, 20A 20G comprising an elongate, tubular member having a hollow, water conveying interior, one end of the lance being connected in a water sealing manner to a mounting adaptor 18, 18A 18F by which the lance 20, 20A 20G is, in use, releasably mounted on a portion of the cutting device in fluid flow communication with a supply source of pressurised water, the adaptor 18, 18A 18F also being in fluid flow communication with the hollow interior of the lance. The invention also includes a mineral cutter pick com prising a head 9, 9A, 9B , an integral shank 12, 12A 12D formed integrally with the head 9, 9A, 9B and a bore 13, 13A, 13B extending along at least portions of both the head 9, 9A, 9B and the shank 12, 12A 12D , the shank bore 13B being formed at least partially in a side 27 of the shank 12, 12A 12D , which, in use, is the compressive stress side. In another embodiment, a mineral cutter pick comprises a head 9, 9A, 9B provided with a hard material cutting tip 11 , and a shank 12, 12A 12D formed integrally with the head, a bore 13, 13A provided along at least the pick head 9, 9A, 9B , with an outer bore end 14 located rearwardly of the cutting tip 11 , and an inner bore end 15 intersected by a slot 42 provided in at least a portion of the shank 12D .
