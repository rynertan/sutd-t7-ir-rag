# Catalyst system and process for producing a catalyst.

## Abstract
In accordance with one embodiment of this invention, a bis cyclopentadienyl chromium II compound is introduced onto an activated phosphate containing support and utilized in conjunction with an organometal cocatalyst, such as an alkylal uminum. In accordance with another embodiment of this in vention, a phosphate containing zerogel is formed by remov ing water from an aluminum phosphate containing hydrogel by means of azeotropic distillation or washing with a volatile, wa ter miscible organic compound, activated and thereafter a bis cyclopentadienyl chromium II compound is incorporated therewith. In other embodiments of this invention, a phos phate containing support is formed by forming aluminum phosphate from an aluminum alkoxide or from a melt, or by phosphating silica or alumina, or by forming an aluminum phosphate silica combination. A support thus formed is acti vated and a bis cyclopentadienyl chromium II compound added. Alternatively in all embodiments, the chromium and phosphate components can be added separately. The result ing catalysts are capable of giving narrow molecular weight distribution polymer because of the inherent high molecular weight of the polymer produced, and the unusual sensitivity to hydrogen, a broad spectrum of polymers can be produced so far as molecular weight is concerned. The catalyst is ideally suited for forming olefin polymers such as ethylene and ethy lene copolymers in a slurry system.
