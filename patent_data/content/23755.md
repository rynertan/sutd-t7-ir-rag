# Apparatus for controlling the lateral alignment of a belt.

## Abstract
An apparatus 20 for controlling the lateral movement of a belt 10 arranged to move along a pre determined path. The apparatus 20 includes a belt sensor 68 mounted translatably on a belt support 64 . As the belt 10 moves laterally the sensor 68 translates therewith causing the belt support 64 to pivot so as to return the belt 10 to the pre determined path. The belt support 64 is pivotally mounted on a fixed shaft 66 and the sensor 68 is connected to the shaft 66 through a link 72 so that translation of the sensor 68 causes the support 64 to pivot about shaft 66 .
