# X ray analysis apparatus.

## Abstract
In an X ray analysis apparatus provided with a detector comprising photodiode detection elements, it is possible to eli minate the dark current and the background current from the measurement signals due to the fact that elements in the signal reading device can be combined. Due to the fact that also dur ing the measurement at a stationary peak beside the signal amplitude also signal ratios can be obtained from combinations of detector elements, the correct position and amplitude of the peaks to be measured can be determined. The detector can also be provided with mutually separated detector elements which have such a surface area and configuration that the dark current can already be conpensated thereby.
