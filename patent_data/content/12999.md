# Rubber compositions and method for vulcanizing same.

## Abstract
A particular carbon black in a medium vinyl polybutadiene composition gives a vulcanizable rubber composition with superior blowout resistance, low heat buildup, and good resilience after vulcanizing. Such a carbon black in blends of medium vinyl polybutadiene and natural rubber provides a vulcanizable rubber composition having good dynamic wire cord adhesion as measured by time to failure .
