## Description
Stable, aqueous, acidic solution of cis platinum, suitable for injection. This invention relates to a stable, aqueous, hydrochloric acid containing solution of cis platinum chemical name cis dichlorodiammine platinum , suitable for injection, as well as to a process for preparation thereof. Such a solution is known from Dutch patent application 7901283. According to this patent application the pH of the solution is adjusted to a value in the range of 2.0 3.0, preferably 2.3 2.7. Although the rights claimed in said patent application have not been restricted thereto, it appears from the specific examples that in such a solution also xnannitdl is incorpo rated. This also is logical, for the process disclosed there constitutes an improvement over the form of the preparation which was usual before that time, wherein the cis platinum was delivered as a white lyophilized powder in combination with sodium chloride, mannitol and hydrochloric acid, which powder had to be remade with sterile water.Moreover, these combinations had to be stored with cooling, and the remaking of course was a tedious procedure, and the remade compositions had a useful life of only about 20 hours at 220C. It is for this reason that according to patent application 7901283 a stable, sterile aqueous solution of cis platinum is provided with t e abovementioned low pH, because according to that patent application the composition only then shows a sufficient stability. Now, the side effects of anti tumor agents are already quite serious and a pH in a so strongly acidic range of course does not make the injection more agreeable. Por the rest, the teachings of Dutch patent application 7901283 are in agreemont with an article in Journal of the Parenteral Drug Association, MayAiune 1979, pages 107 115.This article discusses the stability of cisplatinum in aqueous media suitable for parenteral administration.It appears from this article that the stability of cis platinum therein usually is measll ed in hours and that the decomposition of the cis platinum is promoted by a pH higher than 7 see page 113 , whereas for instance solutions of common salt, dextrose and mannitol usual2y show pH vaLues in the range of 4 6 as a result of absorbed carbon dioxide and the like, so that they do not show an additional acceleration of the decomposition. For the rest, it appears that a pH of 4 for such a neutral solution would be an extremely low value which normally will not be attained, and it neither appears from sawd article that experiments have been carried out at such a low pH. A proposal of different nature is found in Dutch patent application 8101531. According to that patent application a mixture of 30 95 of poly ethylene glycol or methoxy polyethylene glycol and 70 5 of water is used as the solvent, and the solution also contains a source of chloride ions. Preferably, the solvent is a mixture of about 80 95 polyethylene glycol or methoxy polyethylene glycol and about 5 20 water. As appears from the specification and examples, the composition should not necessarily contain HCl, although this is the case in many of the examples. No mention is made of a pH value and of course a pH value is not so significant in a predomi nantly non aqueuous composition. The said proposal indeed leads to a stable concentrated solution, but the drawback is the presence of the polyethylene glycol or methoxy polyethylene glycol . In general the physicians prefer that the cis platinum composition to be administered contains as little foreign substances as possible.In view of the strong side effects of this ,aRtt canCer agent which differ from patient to patient, an individual dosage of adjuvants is to be highly preferred and for this reason these adjuvants are preferably administered separately. Moreover, the treatment with sub stances which should reduce the noxious side effects of the ci s platinum, should often be carried out on a trial and error base. Consequently, the problem still exists to prepare a stable solution of cis platinum which contains as little other substances as possible, and is not too extremely acidic. Surprisingly, it has now been found that this object indeed can be attained with The aid of a solution which only contains ci s platinum, corsmon salt and hydrochloric acid. To this end the invention provides a stable, aqueous, hydrochloric acid containing solution of cis platinum, suitable for injection, which is characterized in that this solution contains no more than 1.0 mg ml cisplatinum and sodium chloride in an amount of Ob4 1 , has a pH of 3 5 and is substantially free of other ingredients. With substantially free of other ingredients is meant here that the solution preferably does not contain any further ingredients, but that, if necessary, small amount of adjuvants, as are perhaps desired by individual physicians, can be added, provided in an amount which is not greater than that of the cis platinum in the solution. Preferably, the pH of the solution is 3.2 3.5. Furthermore, it is preferred that the sodium chloride concentration of the solution closely corresponds to that of a physiological salt solution. The solution of this invention can be prepared in any desired way. A practical method is to dissolve the cis platinum in desired concentration in a solution of the sodium chloride in a part of the water, whereafter the pH of this solution is brought at the desired value with the aid of hydrochloric acid, and then the solution is diluted with water to the desired concentration. If the cis platinum content is higher than 0.6 mg ml, the cis platinum may cristallize at temperatures below 200C. Therefore,it is preferred that the cis platinum content is no more than 0.6 mg ml and even more particularly not more than 0.5 mg ml. However, if temperatures below about 200C are not to be expected during shipping and storage of the solution, contents up to the usual 1.0 mg ml can also be used. An example of the preparation is as follows 450 g of sodium chloride are dissolved in 25 1 of distilled and pyrogene free water. Then 25 g of cis platinum content 100 are dissolved in the so obtained solution. Thereafter 60 ml of 10 hydrochloric acid are added, whereby the pH is adjusted to a value of 3.2 3.5. Subsequently, distilled and pyrogene free water is added to the solution to a volume of 50 1. Finally, the entire mixture is filtered aseptically through a sterile membrane filter of 0.22 um into sterile containers. The so obtained sterile solution can be introduced in the usual way into sterile vials or ampoules for injection. These vials or ampoules can contain for instance 10, 25 or 50 mg of the active compound. It is still remarked that, although as mentioned hereinabove, further small amounts of additives in principle may bo present, which perhaps will be the case in future, if a certain trend would be formed among a group of physicians, it is now preferred that the composition does not contain further ingredients. Tlle stability of the so obtained solutions was tested with HPLC in an analogous way as described on pages 108 and 109 of the article in Journal of the Parenteral Drug Association. During the analytical research in preparation thereto, it was found however that it was not necessary to use both a cation exchange and an anion exchange column, but that the use of the anionexchange column Whatman Partisil lO SAX mentioned in the article, is suffi r .ient. This was established by preparing a number of test solutions and examining these according to both methods. It appeared that the determination of the cis platinum content with the simpler method yielded results which were completely comparable with the results of the method with two co1ulms. The method with one column not only has the advantage that it is .mplr, but also that the regeneration is much simper. As the mobile phase the same mixture was chosen as in the article, 30 acetic acid sodium acetatebuffer pH 5.6, 0.01 M and 70 methanol.The elation rate was 1.2 ml per minute and the injected volume was 100 pl. The detection was carried out at 303 nm. The calculation was carried out with the aid of a Spectrum Physics integrator.In this chromatography the composition products and transplatinum are separated from the cis platinum and eluted with the solvent front. In this way the decomposition of the cis platinum was followed at various temperatures and various pH values. As typical, the results are given here which were obtained at pH 4.0. The tests were carried out with dosages of 10 ml and of 50 ml. During all the tests, the solutions remained clear and they had a colour value of G6.
