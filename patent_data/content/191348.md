# AN ADAPTIVE GLOW PLUG CONTROLLER

## Abstract
An adaptive glow plug controller provides a tracking model temperature means for controlling the application of power to one or more glow plugs in response to the present temperature of the glow plugs. Several control circuits control the maximum time that the power is supplied to the glow plugs and the use of the glow plugs at various temperature levels of the environment and or the engine.
