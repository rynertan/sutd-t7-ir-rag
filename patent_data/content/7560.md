## Description
Color developing sheet for no carbon copying process The present invention relates to a color develop ing sheet for use in no carbon copying process. More particularly, it relates to a color developing sheet for use in no carbon copying process of which colordeveloping agent comprises a combination of a phenolic resin and an active silica compound, quite resistant to yellowing of color developing sheet itself and to fading of the developed image even if exposed to sunlight, the light of fluorescent lamp or the atmospheric air for a long period of time. In general, a no carbon copying paper is constituted of a top sheet and a bottom sheet , where the top sheet is a paper coated with microcapsules containing a solution of electron donating colorless dye such as Crystal Violet Lactone, Benzoyl LeucomethyleneBlue, Malachite Green Lactone, Rhodamine Anilinolactarn, 3 diethylamino 6 methyl 7 anilinofluoran and the like in a non volatile oily solvent, and the bottom sheet is a paper coated with an electron accepting colordeveloping agent a solid acid such as activated clay, acid clay, attapulgite or the like or an acidic polymer such as a phenol formaldehyde resin and an appropriate binder.When the two sheets are superposed so that the coated surfaces confront each other and a pressure of pencil or typewriter is applied thereto, the capsules in the pressed part are ruptured and the color forming agent colorless dye transfers to and contacts with the color developing agent to form a color, whereby a colored image is obtained. As its applications, there are also known a middle sheet which is coated with color forming and color developing agents separately on its front and back sides, respectively, and is used by inserting between the top and bottom sheets, as well as a self contained paper coated with a color forming and a color developing agents on the same side. Accordingly, a color developing sheet for use in no carbon paper should satisfy the following requirements 1 High whiteness and excellent resistance to yellowing after standing for a long period of time 2 High color intensity and high storage stabilit of the image formed and 3 Good printing characteristics. Attapulgite, acid clay, activated clay and the like, called under the generic name of solid add have a very porous surface, so that a color developing paper prepared therefrom absorbs ink quite rapid t the time of printing and has an excellent high speed printability as a color developing shef for no carbon copying process which requires a very n1gh ink absorption as the result of th2 speed c lng in t.ae more time.However, bi type l veloping absorbs atmospheric moisture when left standing in the air for several months or gradually deteriorates its characteristics owing presumably to adsorption of atmospheric carbon dioxide and, as the result, loses its color developing reactivity with a color forming agent. In addition, the colored image obtained therefrom is poor in light resistance. Particularly in the case of black colored image, it turns to red with time even if it is not exposed to direct sunlight. These facts greatly injure its commercial value in respect of storability. In view of above, there have been a number of attempts to prevent the deterioration of color developing ability of color developing sheet prepared from these solid acids or to improve the light resistance of the colored image. For example, Japanese Patent PublicationNo. 16965 1975 mentions that the discoloration of colored image can be reduced by incorporating an inorganic nitrous acid compound. In Japanese Patent PublicationNo. 16968 1975, it is mentioned that light resistance of colored image can be improved by incorporating a cyanamide type organic compound or a metallic compound. In Japanese Patent Publication No. 45245 1977, it is mentioned that the light resistance of colored image can be improved by using a composite silicate which had been reacted wit an alkaline earth metallic compound. In Japanese Patent Publication No. 5247 1977, it is mentioned that a colored image can be made resistant to light by the coexistence with an organic carboxylic acid or its alkali metal salt. All these descriptions suggest that polyvalent metal compounds have an action to improve the color developability or to stabilize the colored image. However, addition of these metallic compounds tJ num olid acids cannot alter the essential character of solid acid even though it can improve color developability or improve light resistance to some extent. Therefore, this technique cannot be said to be practical. In addition, the addition of these metallic compounds sometimes exhibits a negative effect such as increasing the viscosity of coating fluid which deteriorates workability, coloring the color developing sheet itself, deteriorating heat resistance and storage life of product, etc. which all lead to deterioration of performances as a color developing agent. Therefore, this technique cannot be said to be practical. In the light of the decrease of color developability of solid acids occurring during longer storage or the insufficient light resistance of colored image, it has been proposed to use a phenolic resin as a colordeveloping agent which has an excellent color developability and hardly shows deterioration of color developaability even after a longterm storage. Japanese PatentPublication No. 20144 1967 . Thereafter, an attempt has been published to use a solid acid in combination with a phenolic resin. Japanese Patent PublicationNo. 17886 1975 . It is the object of this invention to improve a color developing sheet in which an active silicic acid compound and a phenolic resin are used in combination as color developing agents. Thus, a color developing sheet in which a mixture of active silicic acid compound and a phenolic resin is used as color developing agent is superior to a color developing sheet in which only active silicic acid compound is used as color developing agent in respect of light resistance of developed image and stability Of color formation even after a long term storage. As compared with a color developing sheet in which only a phenolic resin is used as color developing agent, it is improved in printing ink absorption and high speed printability. A color developing sheet prepared from a combination of active silicic acid compounds and phenolic resins has the above mentioned advantages.However, it is much more susceptible to yellowing than that prepared from phenolic resin alone. Thus, its improvement is considered necessary. The yellowing is attributable to the character of phenolic resin itself which is susceptible to yellowing when exposed to sunlight or the light of fluorescent lamp. This tendency is particularly noticeable when a phenolic resin is combined with an active silicic acid compound of an advanced stage of activation because its strong oxidative power promotes the yellowing change.Although a color developing sheet prepared from a combination of phenolic resin and active silicic acid compound can satisfy the requirement concerning the performances of no carbon paper, the yellowing injures its commercial value so that its practical application is impossible. For this reason, its improvement has been desired intensely. Thus, the object of the present invention resides in providing a color developing sheet of which color developing agent comprises a combination of an active silicic acid compound and a phenolic resin having the following characteristic features 1 an improved resistance to yellowing, 2 an improved light resistance of colored image, and 3 an excellent printability. The object of the present invention can be achieved by incorporating titanium oxide into the layer of combined color developing agents. In the invention, the process for producing no carbon paper is not particularly limited. However, in a representative embodiment, the coating composition of color developing agent is prepared by mixing an aqueous dispersion of acid clay or activated clay with an aqueous dispersion of finely powdered phenolic resin or a clay such as kaolinite or an adhesive such as starch or latex.The object of the invention can be achieved by mixing such a coating composition with titanium oxide. In incorporating titanium oxide, one may add it at the time of dispersing clay before dispersing an adhesive such as starch or latex. Alternatively, titanium oxide may be added at the stage of agitation after the addition of adhesive, though it is recommendable to add titanium oxide before the addition of adhesive from the viewpoint of dispersing effect. The titanium oxide used in the invention is generally produced from an ilmenite ore TiO2 40 60 by the sulfuric acid process, chlorine process, etc., though the invention is not particularly limited in the production process of titanium oxide. Titanium oxide can be classified into anatase and rutile based on the difference in crystal structure, and the power to prevent yellowing is somewhat dependent on crystal structure. Generally speaking, rutile is more effective than the other for the suppression of yellowing, so that rutile type titanium oxide is preferable, Such a titanium oxide is usually available commercially at a relatively low price, and is not a particularly special substance.Since a sufficient effect can be obtained by adding a small quantity to the dispersion system of clay, the preparative work is quite simple and necessitates no complicated pretreatment nor special equipment. Therefore, its use is quite economical and advantageous. The present inventors have conducted a study with the aim of employing, as a color developing layer, a combination of phenolic resin and silicic acid compound with various white pigments such as activated clay, kaolinite, zeolite, or oxides, hydroxides, silicates or carbonates of metals such as calcium, magnesium, aluminum, zinc, titanium, manganese or the like. As the result, it has been found that the whiteness of color developing sheet can be improved without injuring the quality of no carbon paper by using zinc oxide, titanium oxide, aluminum hydroxide, calcium carbonate, calcined kaolinite or the like in combination with phenolic resins and silicic acid compounds. All the color developing sheets prepared therefrom were comparable in the whiteness just after being prepared. However, after exposure to light, there was found a great difference from one another and titanium oxide had the greatest effect for preventi yellowing, which was an unexpected fact When incorpora into color developing agent layer, it could exhibit a sufficient effect with an amount of 1 5 1 10 bae the other metallic compounds.If compared with zinc oxide which exhibits a relatively good effect at the same level of concentration, titanium oxide exhibi d an effect much exceeding zinc oxide. regarding als the other characteristics as no carb n pWo such as stability of color developing abili y with the lapse of time, color intensity, w rk in the prep of coating compesition, and print lity, titani oxide gave good results. Thus, it was found that titanium oxide is most effective in the color developing sheet which employs a combination of active silicic acid compounds and phenolic resins. Another pronounced effect obtained is that the light resistance of colored image can be improved by incorporating titanium oxide into the color developing layer. Accordingly, as compared with a color developing sheet prepared from only phenolic resin and active silicic acid compound, the color developing sheet of te invention is much improved in the resistance to yellowing and the developed image is much improved in resistance to light even when exposed to sunlight. In addition, it is possible to improve the commerciai value and to offer a no carbon paper having an excellent nigh speed printability. In order to further preventing the yellowing a d further improving the light resistance of developed age, it is also possible to use, in combination with anium oxide, the above mentioned metallic compounds, ultraviolet adsorbers, antioxidants and the like in the process of preparing a color developing coating ccmposition. The active silicic acid compounds usable in the invention are general silicic acid compounds ntaining SiC as its first component and having many Broensted aa points and cr Lexis acid points. Principal examples of said active silicic acid compounds include activated clay, acid clay, attapulgite, silica, silica alumina, silica magnesia, natural zeolite and the like. Composite metal silicate compounds obtainable by the reaction with compounds of zinc, aluminum or alkaline earth metals are also included. The invention is not particularly limited in the preparative process of active silicic acid compounds. The phenolic resins usable in the invention are those known under the name of novolac type phenolic resins, such as phenol formaldehyde resin, phenolacetylene resin and the like. Their examples include polycondensation resins obtainable by reacting formaldehyde or acetaldehyde with p alkylphenol, poctylphenol, p nonylphenol and the like arylphenols such as p phenylphenol and the like aralkylphenols such as c naphtylphenol, naphtylphenol cumylphenol, benzylphenol and the like and halogenated phenols such as p chlorophenol and the like. The so called heavy metal modified phenolic resins obtainable by modifying them with zinc or manganese are also included. Said phenolic resins and said silicic acid compounds are preferably used in a proportion of about 1 2 16, and the amount of titanium oxide added is in the range of 0.1 5 based on phenolic resin, and preferably in the range of 0.2 3. All these numerical figures are evidenced to be practical industrially. The invention will be illustrated below by referring to the following examples which are presented in no limitative way. In the examples, all parts and percentages are by weight. In the examples, the colored image was developed by combining a commercial top sheet MitsubishiNCR with the color developing sheet of the invention and passing them through a super calender roll under a loading pressure of 83 kg cm2Example 1 0.5 part of sodium hexametaphosphate was dissolved in 150 parts of water. Into the solution were dispersed 40 parts of activated clay Silton, manufactured by Mizusawa Chemical and 15 parts of titanium oxide R 650, manufactured by Sakai Chemical . Then, 19 parts of 389.aqueous emulsion of p phenylphenol resin RBE 40, manufactured by Mitsui Toatsu was added and dispersed. pH of the fluid thus obtained was adjusted to 9.0 with caustic soda, and then 20 parts of 48 DowLatex 636 SBR latex manufactured by Asahi Dow was added and homogenized to give a coating composition. The latter was applied to a high quality paper 40 g m2 with a coating rod at an application rate of 5 g m2 on dry basis and dried. Thus, a colordeveloping sheet was obtained. Example 2 A color developing sheet was prepared by repeating the procedure of Example 1, except that the activated clay was replaced with zinc treated activated clay having a zinc content of 4.5P. Example 3 A color developing sheet was prepared by repeating the procedure of Example 2, except that 5 parts of titanium oxide and 55 parts of kaolinite were used.Comparative Examples 1 5 In the same manner as in Example 1, 0.5 part of sodium hexametaphosphate was dissolved in 150 parts of water, 40 parts of zfnc treated activated clay and 45 parts of kaolinite were added to the solution with stirring, 15 parts of metallic compound shown below or kaolinite was added in place of titanium oxide, and 19 parts of 38 aqueous emulsion of phenolic resin was dispersed into the fluid. Then pH of the fluid was adjusted to 9.0 with caustic soda, and 20 parts of 48 Dow Latex 636 SBR latex manufactured by Asahi Dow was added and homogenized to give a coating composition. The coating composition was applied to a high quality paper 40 g m2 at an application rate of 5 g m2 solids by means of a coating rod and dried to give a color developing sheet.

The numerical figures of Table 1 express the reflectances of the coated surface before irradiation with sunlight and 10 hours after irradiation, measured by means of a color difference meter manufactured byNihon Denshaku K.K. . In the columns of whiteness, smaller value of reflectance means more yellowing or more discoloration. In the columns of intensity, a smaller value of reflectance means that the color wrstensity is greater and the image is more resistant tc light. Table 1 demonstrates that yellowing of the color developing sheet is more prevented and light resistance of the image is more improved by the use of titanium oxide.
