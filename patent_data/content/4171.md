Compound 1 of Table I 3.0 g was suspended in carbon tetrachloride 125 ml .Sulphuryl chloride 2.5 g was added dropwise. When addition was complete, the mixture was heated under reflux for 4 hours, and then cooled. The solid was collected and recrystallised from toluene to give compound no 14 1.6 g with a melting point of 1620C. EXAMPLE 6 This Example illustrates the preparation of compound no 13 of Table I. Compound 1 of Table I 3.0 g was added in portions to concentrated sulphuric acid ,15 g , with stirring and cooling. Fuming nitric adid 5 g was added dropwise with stirring and cooling to below LOPS. The mixture was then stirred for 30 minutes at room temperature and then heated for 1 hour on a steam bath.The resulting solution was cooled and poured on to ice. The yellow solid was recrystallised from toluene to give compound no 13 2.5 g with a melting point of 172 0C EXAMPLE 7 This Example illustrates the preparation of compound no 8 of Table I by a method alternative to that ofExample 2. 3 Amino 4 bromopyrazole 1.62 g was added in portions to a stirred solution of isopropyl bis chloroformylamine 1.84 g in dry acetonitrile. When addition was complete the mixture was heated under reflux for 2 hours. The mixture was cooled and filtered. Evaporation of the filtrate gave a solid 0.5 g identified as compound no 8 by its melting point 214 0C and its nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum and mass spectrum. EXAMPLE 8 This Example illustrates the preparation of compound no 2 of Table I. 3 Amino 4 cyanopyrazole 3.24 g was added in portions with stirring at room temperature to a solution of isopropyl bis chloroformylamine 5.6 g in dry acetonitrile 60 ml . The mixture was then heated under reflux for 4 hours, cooled, and filtered. The filtrate was evaporated to give a gummy solid which was extracted with boiling toluene 125 ml . The extract was left overnight to cool and the crystals which separated 2.25 g collected and identified as compound no 2 with a melting point of 1320C. EXAMPLE 9 This Example illustrates the preparation of compound no 10 of Table I. 3 Amino 4 cyano 5 methoxypyrazole 2.0g was added in portions to a stirred solution of isopropyl bischloroformylamine in dry acetonitrile. After addition was complete the mixture was heated under reduced pressure and the residue triturated with ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate solution was filtered and evaporated to give a gummy solid which was triturated with water. The solid so obtained 0.8 g was identified as compound no 10 ofTable I. EXAMPLE 10 This Example illustrates the preparation of compound no 9 of Table I. 3 Amino 4 cyano 5 dimethylaminopyrazole 1.85 g was added in portions to a stirred solution of isopropyl bischloroformylamine 2.3 g in dry acetonitrile 30 ml .The mixture was heated under reflux for 2e hours, cooled, and filtered. The filtrate was evaporated. The gummy solid which remained was triturated with ether, and collected to give compound 9 1.3 g with a melting point of 2000C. EXAMPLE 11 This Example illustrates the preparation of compound no 7 of Table I. Compound no 6 of Table I t,O.9 g , prepared from 3 amino 4 cyano 5 methylthiopyrazole and isopropyl bis chioroformylamine in the usual way, was suspended in 90 sulphuric acid 10 ml and heated to 90 1000C for 1 hour, cooled, and poured into ice and water. The white solid which resulted wat collected and dried to give compound no 7 0.8 g with a melting point of 260 C. EXAMPLE 12 This Example illustrates the preparation of compound no 60 of Table I. Compound no 57 of Table I 0.95 g was added in portions with stirring to a suspension of sodium hydride 0.08 g in dry dimethylformamide 20 ml . When effervescence had ceased, the clear solution was treated dropwise with methyl iodide 0.5 g in a small volume of dry dimethylformamide. The mixture was then stirred for 1 hour and poured into ice and water 75 g . The resulting solid was collected, dried, and identified as compound 60 0.83 g with a melting point of 129 C.
