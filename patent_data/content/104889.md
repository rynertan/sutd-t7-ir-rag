# SYSTEM FOR MEASURING CARRIER LIFETIME IN A SEMICONDUCTOR WAFER

## Abstract
An rf apparatus and technique are disclosed for mea surement of the carrier lifetime from the photoconductivity induced in silicon wafers 2 by a flash of infrared light 9 . The carrier lifetime is inferred from the photoconductivity decay. The technique involves applying an rf signal oscilla tor 12 to a bridge circuit 6,8 , in an arm of which a silicon wafer 2 is capacitively coupled, and monitoring changes in the bridge output when the silicon wafer is illuminated.
