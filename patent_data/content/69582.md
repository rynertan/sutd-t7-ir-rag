## Description
POLYMER DISPERSIONS AND THEIR USE IN COATING COMPOSITIONS This invention relates to aqueous polymer dispersions which are suitable for use in coating compositions to the preparation of aqueous polymer dispersions and to the use of the dispersions in coating processes. It is known from British Patent 1,515,723 to prepare stable aqueous dispersions, useful as coating compositions, of thermoplastic polymer particles which coitrise a blend of at least two different polymers The dispersions are made by dissolving a thermoplastic polymer such as nitrocellulose in at least one polymerisable monomer of law water solubility, dispersing the solution in water in the presence of a surfactant and thereafter polymerising the monomer to form a stable dispersion of polymer particles. It is stated that the polymer obtained from the monomer is substantially nongrafted and non crosslinked. For many purposes, however, it is desirable to employ a coating composition which can be thermoset after application to a substrate.Such purposes include the use of primer coatings for metals which are intended to afford good corrosion protection. It is now established practice to apply primer coatings to metals by an electrodeposition process. One potential disadvantage of such a process is that, due for example to different. electrical behaviour,distinct particles of different material intended to form in combination the final coating, and contained in a composition to be applied by electrodeposition, may deposit on the substrate in a ratio which is different from that ratio present in the coating composition. We have now found that useful thermoset coatings can be produced, particularly by electrodeposition but also by other application processes such as spraying, when all of the ingredients for a specific type of thermoset coating are contained within the same particle.A further advantage of the use of such particles is that the dispersed ingredients of the coating composition which are co reactive, for example in a subsequent heating stage, are in intimate association with each other as distinct from dispersions in which different coreactive materials present as distinct particles may deposit unevenly on the substrate. The invention provides an aqueous polymer dispersion wherein disperse polymer particles are cationically, anionically or non ionically stabilised in an aqueous medium and each of the particles comprises a a polymeric modifier as herein defined comprising reactive groups b an addition polymer comprising reactive groups of the same or similar chemical type to the reactive groups in the polymeric modifier, and c a crosslinking agent which comprises reactive groups complementary to the reactive groups present in a and b . Preferably the dispersion is prepared by a process wherein there is first produced in an aqueous medium a dispersion of cationically, anionically or nonionically stabilised particles each of which particles comprises i a preformed polymeric modifier as herein defined comprising reactive groups, ii polymerisable ass ethylenically unsaturated monomer or monomers, at least one monomer comprising a reactive group which is the same as or similar to those reactive groups in the preformed polymer, said preformed polymer being dissolved in said monomer or monomers, and iii a cross linking agent which comprises reactive groups complementary to the reactive groups in i and ii and the polymerisable monomer or monomers is are polymerised to produce in situ an addition polymer. Preferably the polymerisation is carried out under conditions which are not conducive to significant interaction of the reactive groups of i , ii and iii , for example at temperatures close to ambient. Under such conditions it is believed that grafting of the addition polymer onto the preformed polymer modifier does not occur to any mayor or even significant extent and it is preferred to employ components a and b in which there is no significant grafting The dispersions of this invention may be prepared by certain alternative but less suitable processes, for example in which the different components are mixed in a non aqueous medium. The invention also provides an aqueous coating composition which comprises the said polymer dispersion, and also a coating process which employs the said coating composition, particularly a process of coating an article by electrodeposition wherein the article is made one electrode in an electrical circuit. In referring to a dispersion of cationically, anionically or non ionically stabilised particles in an aqueous medium we mean that the stabilisation of the disperse particles in the aqueous medium is substantially due respectively to the presence of cationic or anionic groups and their counter ions or non ionic groups, the groups being present in or associated with one or more components of the particle. Thus, for example, there may be present in and or associated with the disperse particles or with a component thereof a distinct cationic, anionic or non ionic surfactant alternatively suitable stabilising groups may be present in one or more of the components of the disperse particle.In general the same cationic or anionic groups and their counter ions or the same nonionic groups will be responsible for the stability of the disperse particles in the aqueous polymer dispersion of this invention as well as of the intermediate dispersion of particles used in the preferred preparative process described above, i. e. during in situ polymerisation of the ethylenically unsaturated monomer s . The stability ofe dispersion is to be determined primarily by only one of the three types of stabilising means discussed A small proportion of the two other types may be present and or associated with the disperse particles but such groups do not play a primary role in the stabilisation of the disperse particles. In one embodiment of a coating process according to the invention, wherein a composition comprising cationically stabilised disperse particles is electrodeposited on an article as cathode, it is required that particles stabilised in an aqueous medium at a pH of say 6 or less are destabilised under the conditions which prevail in the region of the cathode, for example at a pH of 10 11It should be noted that in order to achieve satisfactory deposition at a cathode with a polymer dispersion according to this invention it is necessary to ensure that the stabilisation of the dispersion is not unduly enhanced by the presence of a non ionic.group, for example a poly ethylene oxide group. Similar considerations apply to the deposition of an anionically stabilised dispersion at an anode at, say, pE 7 which may be destabilised at, say, pH 4. The selection of the appropriate components, polymeric modifier, addition polymer which is preferably derived from monomer or monomers which are polymerised in the above preferred process to give addition polymer formed in situ and crosslinking agent, will depend upon a number of factors for example, the effective filmforming temperature which is required of the blend of polymeric modifier, addition polymer, and crosslinking agent before crosslinking is effected the properties of an ultimate crosslinked coating, e.g. hardness or flexibility the presence of suitable complementary reactive groups to enable crosslinking the conditions under which crosslinking is to be achieved or the compatibility of the components. Reactive groups and complentary reactive groups which may be present in the polymeric modifier and addition polymer components include hydroxyl, amino, carboxyl, alkoxy methyl, epoxide, amide, blocked or capped isocyanate groups and ss hydroxyester groups as disclosed in European Patent Application 0 012 463. Suitable combinations of reactive and complementary reactive groups which can enable crosslinking include for example hydroxyl groups which are reactive with methylol, alkylated methylol or 8 hydroxyester groups hydroxyl or epoxy groups which are reactive with carboxyl groups and hydroxyl or amino groups which are reactive with isocyanate groups. In general it is arranged that these groups, when present, will not be reacted under the conditions of preparing the dispersion of polymer particles from the desired components, for example during the polymerisation of the ethylenically unsaturated monomer by the above described process, although there is not excluded the case where a small extent of useful crosslinking may occur when desired, for example under the conditions of addition polymerisation. Byapolymeric modifier we mean a resinous, preferably non plasticising, polymer which will usually contribute to the essential properties, usually the hardness, of an ultimate crosslinked thermoset coating obtained from a coating composition according to the invention. Preferably the polymeric modifier is of molecular weight at least 500, more preferably at least 700 and contributes significantly to the chemical resistance of the coatings obtained.Particularly suitable polymeric modifiers are the hydroxyl group containing epoxy resins for example derived from epichlorhydrin and diphenylol propane or derivatives thereof, for example the modifier may be an epoxy resin in which the epoxide groups have been reacted but will contain hydroxyl groups and will have the characteristic desirable polymer structure of the epoxy resins. Other polymeric modifiers include, for example, alkyd resins and certain polyester or addition polymers e.g. styrene allyl alcohol copolymers. Typical reactive groups which may be present in these polymers and which are reactive with reactive groups contained in typical crosslinking agents include hydroxy, amino, epoxide and carboxyl groups. More than one polymeric modifier may be used. The preformed polymeric modifier used in the process described above is preferably completely soluble in the ethylenically unsaturated monomer s but since it is the compatibility of preformed polymer and polymerised monomer which is usually desired, the preformed polymer may not be completely soluble in the monomer s . A mixture of preformed polymeric modifiers may be used, for example containing different reactive groups, or some modifier may be free from reactive groups. Suitable ethylenically unsaturated monomers containing reactive groups such as hydroxyl, amido, and carboxyl groups include hydroxy isopropyl methacrylate, hydroxyethyl acrylate, hydroxybutyl acrylate, acry lami de, acrylic acid. These monomers may be used to prepare the addition polymer component of the disperse particles, and are suitable monomers to use in the process above described. Suitable ethylenically unsaturated monomers which are copolymerisable with monomers containing reactive groups such as those just mentioned include methyl methacrylate, butyl acrylate, butyl methacrylate, ethyl acrylate, 2 ethylhexyl acrylate and styrene. Preferably the monomers have a maximum solubility in water of low by weight at 250C. When the dispersion of polymer particles is prepared by the process earlier described, the crosslinking agent is selected, in conjunction with the initiator system for the ethylenically unsaturated monomer, bearing in mind that crosslinking should not occur to any significant extent at the temperature of the polymerisation stage. Suitable crosslinking agents for use in the preparation of the polymer particles include urea , melamine and benzoguanamine formaldehyde, and phenolformaldehyde resins multifunctional isocyanates or modified isocyanates such as blocked or capped isocyanates and ss hydroxyester containing materials such as described in European Patent Application 0 00 869. Preferably, in the process described above, the crosslinking agent is dissolved in the ethylenically unsaturated monomer together with the polymer modifier. In one aspect of this invention the cat ionic stabilisation of the disperse particles is substantially due to cationic groups which are contained in or are associated with one or more of the components of the particles. Further materials may also require to be preseni in the dispersion, for example acids such as acetic or phosphoric acid to cause ionisation of basic groups. In one case the cationic stabilisation may be due to the presence of a distinct cationic surfactant associated with the particle, for example of a conventional type such as a fatty amine salt, for example a lower alkyl salt of a fatty mono or di amine. Suitable such salts include the acetate salts of tallow and oleyl fatty primary amines.Certain distinct polymeric cationic surfactants may also be used for example addition copolymers which comprise a basic nitrogen atom such as a copolymer of 2 ethylhexyl acry late methylmethacrylate hydroxyethyl methacrylate di methylaminoethyl methacrylate. Alternatively the cationic stabilisation may be due to a modification of at least part of the modifier so that it comprises cationic groups which contribute to or are responsible for stabilisation. As an example, when the polymeric modifier is an epoxy resin comprising epoxide groups and or hydroxyl groups at least part, for example 25 50X, or even up to 100 of the epoxide groups may be reacted with an amine to introduce basic groups. A suitable amine is, for example diethanolamine, although a wide range of other amines may be employed. An acid such as acetic or phosphoric acid is then employed to cause ionisation of the basic groups.It may also be desired to react at least part and preferably all of the remaining unreacted epoxide groups with a masking agent, for example with phenol, in order for example to avoid reaction of such groups when the dispersion is stored. The addition polymer also may contain stabilising groups of the type described. It is an advantage that at least part of the polymeric modifier contains the stabilising groups since when used in coating compositions these groups are substantially buried in the ultimate crosslinked coating. This may not be the case when the stabilisation is provided by a distinct monomeric or low molecular weight surfactant which may be responsible for weakness in the ultimate film, for example under.acid conditions. In another aspect of the invention the stability of the disperse particles is substantially due to anionic groups which are contained in or are associated with one or more of the components of the particles. In one case the anionic stabilisation may be due to the presence of a distinct anionic surfactant associated with the particle, for example of a conventional type such as the amine or alkali metal salt, preferably the triethanolamine salt of fatty acids such as oleic or stearic acid of alkyl aryl sulphonates e.g. dodecyl benzene sulphonic acid or of the mono phosphate of a lauryl alcohol ethylene oxide condensate or of sodium di alkyl sulphosuccinate. It is particularly preferred that the anionic stabilisation of the disperse particles is substantially due to a polymeric surfactant which comprises carboxyl groups. Further materials may also require to be present in the dispersion, for example inorganic bases or watersoluble amines such as triethanolamine in order to cause ionisation of the carboxyl groups. Examples of such a surfactant include, for example, copolymers of acrylic or methacrylic acid with, for example, monomer selected from lower alkyl C1 acrylates or methacrylate, e.g. methyl methacrylate, butyl acrylate, or ethyl acrylate or with styrene. One suitable copolymer is a 20 40 40 copolymer of acrylic acid methyl methacrylate butyl acrylate.Another example of a suitable polymeric surfactant is a meleinised butadiene polymer. The aqueous dispersion may comprise, for example, 2 2t by weight of this type of polymeric surfactant based on the total weight of the disperse particles. Hydroxy containing monomer may be used The polymeric surfactant may also be derived at least in part from a material which serves also as a polymeric modifier component, for example at least part of the polymeric modifier may be notified so that it comprises carboxyl groups. When the polymericmodifier is, for example, an epoxy resin comprising hydroxyl groups and epoxide groups, a proportion of the epoxide groups, e.g.25 50 may be reacted with a reactant known to those in the art which will introduce carboxyl groups. It may also be desired to react at least part of any remaining unreacted epoxide groups in an epoxy resin as polymeric modifier with a masking agent, for example with benzoic acid, in order for example to avoid reaction of such groups when the dispersion is stored. The addition polymer b also may contain stabilising groups. As mentioned above it is an advantage that at least part of the polymeric modifier contains the carboxyl stabilising groups since the carboxyl groups are substantially buried in the ultimate crosslinked coating. This may not be the case when anionic stabilisation is provided by a distinct monomeric or low molecular weight anionic surfactant. In another aspect of the invention the stabilisation af the disperse particles is substantially due to non ionic groups which are contained in or are associated with one or more of the components of the particles.Further materials may also require to be present in the dispersion which affect the stability of the dispersion or its method of use. In one case the non ionic stabilisation may be due to the presence of a distinct non ionic surfactant associated with the particle, for example of a conventional type such as ethylene oxide condensates of long chain fatty acids and alcohols, for example 35 mols. ethylene oxide reacted with oleic acid or oleyl alcohol or bisphenol A, and certain distinct polymeric non ionic surfactants may also be used for example addition copolymers which comprise a non ionic hydrophilic group. Alternatively the non ionic stabilisation may be due to a modification of at least part of the polymeric modifier whereby at least part of the polymeric modifier comprises non ionic groups which contribute to or are responsible for stabilisation. As an example, when the polymeric modifier is an epoxy resin comprising epoxide groups and or hydroxyl groups at least part, for example 25 509 0 of the epoxide groups may be reacted with a poly ethylene glycol . It may also be desired to react at least part of the remaining unreacted epoxide groups with a masking agent, for example with phenol, in order for example to avoid reaction of such groups when the dispersion is stored. The addition polymer b also may contain stabilising groups. The disperse polymer particles may contain a high proportion of polymeric modifier, for example up to 75 by weight based on the total solids content. The disperse polymers themselves or the aqueous medium in which they are dispersed may contain conventna1 ingredients, for example such as are used in coating compositions. These ingredients include pigment, flow promoter, or coalescing solvent. Preferably, the particles are in the size range 0.05 5pm diameter, more preferably 0.1 1 jm When the stabilisation of the disperse particles is due to a distinct cationic, anionic or non ionic surfactant, i.e., a surfactant which is distinct from and substantially different from the defined components a , b and c of the disperse particles, the proportion of the surfactant may be, for example, in the range 2 10 by weight based on the weight of the disperse particles. The stabilisation may be due also to the presence of a distinct surfactant together with stabilising groups present in another component of the particle as described above. The relative proportions of polymeric modifier, addition polymer and crosslinking agent which are present in the disperse particles may vary widely depending upon the properties required, for example, in a final coating.Typical proportions are 5 8 o by weight of the polymeric modifier 20 95rb by weight of the addition polymer and 5 40 0 by weight of the crosslinking agent, all based on the combined weight of these components. The polymer dispersions of this invention, optionally containing pigment and other conventional ingredients, may be used in coating compositions to be applied by a variety of processes such as by electro deposition, spraying, dipping or roller coating. The invention is illustrated by the followingExamples in which parts and percentages are by weight. EXAMPLE 1 This Example illustrates the preparation of a cationically stabilised aqueous polymer dispersion, and its use in an electrodeposition coating process, in which a preformed polymeric modifier is an epoxy resin containing epoxide and hydroxyl reactive groups the addition polymer is one which contains n butoxymethyl reactive groups of similar chemical type to those in the epoxy resin and a cross linking agent which is a urea formaldehyde resin containing alkylated methylol groups which are co reactive with the epoxide and or hydroxyl and n butoxymethyl groups there being present a distinct cationic surfactant. 80 parts of an epoxy resin having an epoxide equivalent of 900 i.e. 900g of resin contain ig equivalent of epoxide commercially available as Epikote 1004 Epikote is a Registered Trade Mark of ShellChemicals were dissolved with the application of heat in a monomer mixture consisting of 66 parts of methyl methacrylate, 44 parts of butyl acrylate and 10 parts of n butoxymethyl acrylamide. To this solution was added 22.2 parts of a urea formaldehyde resin commercially available as Beetle UFR 80 at 96 solids content. Beetle is a Registered Trade Mark of Cyanamid , 12 parts of an alkylamine flow agent commercially available as Ethomeen C12 Ethomeen is a Registered Trade Mark and 2 parts of cumene hydroperoxide as radical polymerisation initiator, and the total solution was emulsified in 460 parts of water containing 32 parts of a cationic surfactant commercially available as Duomac T Duomac is a Registered Trade Mark using a high shear stirrer. A solution of 0.8 part of ascorbic acid in 40 parts of water was then added to the emulsion thus obtained and radicalinitiated addition polymerisation allowed to proceed in the presence of the redox couple which exothermed in the 0 temperature range 25 50 C. The polymerised product was dialysed to remove unwanted ionic species and was then diluted with water to yield a polymer dispersion of 15neo solids. When a steel cathode which had been pretreated with zinc phosphate was immersed in the diluted dispersion at pH 6 and an electric current was passed at 200 volts for 120 secs. between the cathode and a steel anode, also immersed in the dispersion, a coating film was deposited on the cathode. The components of the disperse particles deposited on the cathode were in the same proportions as in the disperse particles of the original coating composit ion. The cathode was rinsed, and heated at 180C for hour to yield a coating affording good protection to the metal, for example in the ASTM salt spray test. EXAMPLE 2 This Example illustrates the preparation and use of an aqueous polymer dispersion in which the preformed polymeric modifier is an epoxy resin wherein epoxide groups are modified to provide basic groups which contribute to the stability of the dispersion in the aqueous phase and wherein there are reactive hydroxyl groups the addition polymer formed in situ contains reactive hydroxyl groups and the cross linking agent is a urea formaldehyde resin containing co reactive alkylated methylol groups. a An adduct of an epoxy resin was first prepared by reacting 380 parts of an epoxy resin of epoxide equivalent commercially available as Epikote 828 Epikote is a Registered Trade Mark with 164 parts of phenol and 26.5 parts of diethanolamine at 160 1800C for 2 hours. 0The adduct was cooled to about 80 C and then dissolved in a. mixture of 470 parts methyl methacrylate, 314 parts butyl acrylate and 71 parts of hydroxy isopropyl methacrylate. 200 parts of the resin solution thus prepared were mixed to form a solution with 42 parts of a lurea formal dehyde resin commercially available as Beetle UFR 80, 12 parts of an alkylamine flow agent commercially available as Ethomeen C12, 2 parts of cumene hydroperoxide and 2.1 parts acetic acid. This solution was then added to 200 parts water whilst subjecting to high shear stirring for 5 minutes and a further 300 parts of water then added whilst maintaining high shear stirring to produce an emulsion. A solution of 0.8 part ascorbic acid in 4.0 parts of water was added with gentle stirring to the emulsion and polymerisation allowed to proceed under the exotherm conditions. When cool, a further 200 parts of water was added to the resulting product which was dialysed to yield a product of 23 solids content. The product was diluted to 15 solids and electrodeposited onto a zinc phosphated steel cathode at 200 volts for 2 minutes. The coated panel was stoved at 1800C for 30 minutes to give a smooth glossy film of thickness 22 microns. b The dispersion prepared above was also pigmented and then applied by electrodeposition to a zinc phosphated steel cathode to give a coating affording good protection to the metal. The dispersion was pigmented by replacing the 42 parts of urea formaldehyde resin Beetle UFR 80 with 80 parts of a millbase prepared by ballmilling 118 parts of the urea formaldehyde resin with 63 parts n butanol, 203 parts titanium dioxide commercially available as Tipure R9001 Tipure is a RegisteredTrade Mark and 4 parts of a black pigment commercially available as Philblack APF and diluting the product with a further 194 parts of the urea formaldehyde resin. c A dispersion made according to a was also applied to a zinc phosphated steel panel by spraying to give a smooth glossy film.

The components A were mixed and warmed to dissolve the stabiliser. B was added and the mixture dispersed in C with high speed mixing The resulting emulsion was diluted with D and E was added to initiate polymerisation at just above ambient temperature. The final product was a white stable emulsion which could be applied to a metal substrate by spraying to give a smooth glossy film. EXAMPLE 4 This Example illustrates the preparation and use of a non ionically stabilised dispersion based on an epoxy resin as modifying polymer according to the invention. Epikote 1009 a commercially available epoxy resin containing hydroxyl groups Epikote is a RegisteredTrade Mark was dissolved in methyl methacrylate and butyl acrylate to give a solution containing 55 Epikote 1009, 29 S methyl methacrylate and 16 butyl acrylate.

The whole was emulsified in 80 parts of demineralised water and the emulsion diluted with 200 parts of demineralised water. A solution of 0.6 part ascorbic acid and 0.3 part ferrous sulphate in 50 parts water were added to the emulsion and radical initiated polymerisation was allowed to proceed in the presence of the redox couple which exothermAd in the temperature range 25 50 C.

A stable, aqueous dispersion of anionically stabilised particles was produced which, at the appropriate level of dilution, could be applied to an anodic metal substrate by electric deposition or to a metal substrate by spraying. EXAMPLE 7 This Example illustrates the preparation of an anionically stabilised aqueous polymer dispersion according to the invention in which the stabiliser is a carboxyl group containing addition polymer. 40 parts of an unmodified, commercially available diepoxide, Epikote 828,were dissolved in a monomer mixture of 33 parts methyl methacrylate, 22 parts butyl acrylate and 5 parts hydroxy isopropyl methacrylate.20 parts of a melamine formaldehyde resin, Cymel 1141, 1 part cumenehydroperoxide and 29 parts of a surfactant copolymer acrylic acid methyl methacrylate butyl acrylate hydroxyisopropyl methacrylate 20 30 30 30 as a 50 by weight solution in butyl cellosolve were added and the whole emulsified in So parts of demineralised water containing 1.6 parts of potassium hydroxide.
