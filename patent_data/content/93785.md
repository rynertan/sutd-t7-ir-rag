# Method for forming cakes.

## Abstract
The sticky confectionary material 17 is transported an endless conveyor 16 adapted to run intermittently, to a position beneath at least one vertically disposed hollow cylinder 10 whose wall is tapered at its lower end 12 and inside which is a piston 14 , at which position the cylinder descends and cuts through the sticky material until its lower edge 13 contacts the endless conveyor, then the piston descends to compress the sticky material to form the cake, after which the cylinder and piston ascend together carrying with them the formed cake, and finally the piston rede scends to press out and release the formed cake which is transported away from the endless conveyor.
