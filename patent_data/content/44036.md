# Articles protected against corrosion and method for protecting articles against corrosion.

## Abstract
Steel articles are protected against corrosion by being completely or partially coated with a material showing a resistivity of at least 0.1 MΩ.cm and comprising a matrix which comprises A inorganic solid particles of a size of from about 5µm to about 0.5µum, or a coherent structure from such homogeneously arranged particles, and B densely packed solid particles having a size of the order of 0.5 100 µm and being at least one order of magnitude larger than the respective particles stated under A , or a coherent structure formed from such densely packed particles, the particles B preferably being Portland cement particles. Particles A are preferably ultrafine silica particles formed by growth from vapour phase and are substantially densely packed in the voids between the particles B. Particles A are especially present in an amount of 10 30 by volume, calculated on the combined volume of the particles A B Composite material for forming the matrix typically compris es Portland cement, ultrafine silica, water in low proportion, and a concrete superplasticizer in high proportion, optionally with additional bodies such as fibers or mica, and is easily shapeable and also suitable for underwater application. Resistivity of the coating material is in the range of 0.3 10 MΩ cm, typically at least 1 MΩ.cm. Development of resistiv ity accelerates when curing is performed at elevated temper ature. Steel article may, e.g., be one in which the stell receives cathodic protection, or a pipe connector which comprises a pair of axially spaced tubular bodies intercon nected by said coating material.
