# Nozzle having a deflector for pressurized fire suppression fluid.

## Abstract
A tubular discharge nozzle 10 for spraying a pressu rized fire suppression liquid from immediately beneath a ceiling 12 in a fire sprinkling system is provided with a hollow, dome shaped, ceiling protective shield 30 disposed to deflect the laterally directed, high velocity fluid streams 28 downwardly away from the ceiling 12 while, at the same time, permitting low volume escape of the fluid upwardly from the shield toward the ceiling 12 through slots 36 or 36a so located in the shield 30 as to produce low velocity secondary plumes 38 which gravitate exterior ly of the shield to merge with the primary streams 28 and thereby maintain the needed, wide spray pattern below the nozzle shield unit.
