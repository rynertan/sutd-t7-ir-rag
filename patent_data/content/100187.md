# AN AQUEOUS REAGENT FOR AND A METHOD OF DETERMINING INORGANIC PHOSPHATE IN A LIQUID SAMPLE

## Abstract
An aqueous reagent for determining inorganic phosphate in a protein containing liquid biological sample comprises a molyb date salt, an acid capable of reacting with the molybdate salt to form molybdic acid for complexation with phosphate to form phosphomolybdate complexes, a ferric salt in an amount suffi cient to inhibit turbidity in the sample, and a nonionic surfactant reagent in an amount sufficient to further inhibit turbidity in the sample, the molybdate salt and the acid being present in amounts sufficient to form an amount of molybdic acid sufficient to produce a detectable color change when complexed with phosphate in the sample. The reagent is used by mixing it with the sample and then colorimetrically measuring said phosphomolybdate complexes as a measure of the inorganic phosphate in the sample.
