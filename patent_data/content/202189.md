# Expandable fastener assembly.

## Abstract
The present invention provides an expandable fastener assembly for use in materials which cannot be successfully fastened by conventional screw threads. The assembly in cludes an insert 20 constructed as a coil to expand uniformly along its convolutions and thereby exert a force upon the adjacent material 50 . A fastener 30 has outer threads com patible with the inner threads of the insert 20 such that when a tightening or seating torque is applied to the fastener 30 it is transferred to the insert 20 . The transferred force expands the insert 20 outwardly with respect to the fastener 30 , without rotation of the insert 20 relative to rotation of the fastener 30 . The invention is also provided with an anti rotation feature to secure the fastener from rotational move ment after installation.
