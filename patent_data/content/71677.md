An upwardly facing bracket 14 is mounted on the frame member 12. The bracket 14 contains an aperture adjacent its upper end. The prime mover 10 is provided with an hydraulic power take off. Mounted to the prime mover 10 is a trench cutter 16 in accordance with the present invention. The trench cutter 16 comprises an elongated arm 18 having a first end provided with an aperture.The first end of the arm 18 is connected to the bracket 14 by a pin or the like extending through the aperture in the bracket 14 and the aperture in the arm 18. The pin or the like is secured in place by any suitable means. An hydraulic piston and cylinder assembly 20 has one end connected to an end of the frame member 12 and a further end connected to an intermediate point on the arm 18.The hydraulic piston and cylinder assembly 20 is operatively connected to the hydraulic power take off of the prime mover 10 and is arranged1 in use, to raise and lower the arm 18 in a vertical plane extending laterally of the prime mover 10. Thus, in the position shown in Figure 1 the arm 18 is raised by extension of the hydraulic piston and cylinder assembly 20. In this position, the trench cutter 16 can be readily transported to another location. In the position shown in Figure 2, the arm 18 is lowered by contraction of the hydraulic piston and cylinder assembly 20 and in this position the trench cutter 16 can be used to cut a trench. The arm 18 further comprises a second end having mounted thereon a rotary cutter member 22. The rotary cutter member 22 is mounted to the arm 18 in the following manner as shown most clearly inFigure 4.A pair of brackets 24 extend outwardly from the arm 18. The extremities of the brackets 24 are located between a pair of rearwardly extending flanges 26 mounted on a plate 28. The extremities of the brackets 24 each contain an aperture. The brackets 24 are pivotally mounted between the flanges 26 on a circular rod 30.Further, an hydraulic piston and cylinder assembly 32 is pivotally mounted between a further rearward facing bracket 34 on the arm 18 and a circular rod 36 mounted between the flanges 26Wee also Figures 1 and 2 . The purpose of the hydraulic piston and cylinder assembly 32 will be described hereinafter. At its lower end as seen in Figure 4, the plate 28 has a further pair of rearwardly extending flanges 37. A stabilising roller 38 is rotatably mounted between the flanges 37. Further, an hydraulic motor 40 is mounted to the rear ofthe plate 28 between the flanges 26 and 361. The hydraulic motor 40 is in driving connection with the cutter member 22. In the embodiment shown, the hydraulic motor 40 drives the cutter member 22 by means of a shaft and reduction gear assembly.The cutter member 22 is mounted to the drive from the hydraulic motor 40 and is spaced from the plate 28 by means of stationary spacer 42. The cutter member 22 comprises an annular disc 44 having welded thereto a flat circular back plate 46. The back plate has a rear surface welded to the annular disc 44 and a front surface having mounted thereon various blades as will be described.Firstly, there is welded to the front surface of the back plate 46 a cylindrical drum 48 which is mounted on the back plate 46 concentrically therewith. A plurality of radially spaced slinger blades 50 are embedded in the back plate 46. The blades 50 each have an inner edge which is welded to the periphery of the drum 48 and a rear side which is welded to the back plate 46. Further, each blade 50 extends generally forwardly from the back plate 46.So as to positively locate each blade 50 on the back plate 46 and prevent flexing and breakage during use each blade 50 is embedded in and so positively engaged with with the back plate 46.Between each of the blades 50, a face cutting blade 52 is welded to the forward edge of the periphery of the drum 48. Ech face cutting blade 52 terminates at a point radially inward of the periphery of the back plate 46. Preferably each face cutting blade 52 extends at an angle to the back plate 46. For maximum face cutting effect, the forward edge of each cutting blade 52 is thus preferably located further away from the back plate 46 than the trailing edge as the cutter is rotated in the clockwise direction as seen in Figure 3 . It is also found that most wear takes place at the outer ends of the forward edges of the cutting blades 52. Therefore, a wear resistant tip 54 is preferably bolted onto each blade 52. The wear resistant tips areL shaped and the leg of the L shape is bolted to a respective blade 52.The leg of the L shape extends forwardly and radially outwardly of the blade 52 and thus in use protects the blade 52 from wear. When the tip 54 becomes worn, the tip 54 can be readily removed and replaced by a fresh tip 54.Further, the base of each L shaped tip 54 extends rearwardly and forms an invert cutting blade. The invert cutting blades shape the lower end of the trench following the cutting of the trench base and give it a neat concave shape.As can be seen in Figure 3 the leg of the L shape extends radially outwardly so as to extend to a point radially outward of the periphery of the backing plate 46. Thus, the base of the L shape is also located radially outward of the periphery of the backing plate 46.Further, as shown, the trailing edge of each blade 52 preferably abuts a side of a forwardly extending blade 50 for greater rigidity in use. Also, the leading edge of each blade 52 may terminate at its inner end in contact with the next leading forwardly extending blade 50.In use, the prime mover 10 is moved to a location at which it is desired to dig a trench with the trench cutter assembly in the position shown inFigure 1. Then the arm 18 is lowered by contraction of the hydraulic piston and cylinder assembly 20 to the position shown in Figure 2.To commence trench cutting, the hydraulic piston and cylinder assembly 32 is extended so as to pivot the trench cutter 22 on the mounted to the arm 18. In this position the forward end of the cutter member 22 is tilted downwardly. Then the cutter member 22 is caused to rotate on its axis by the hydraulic motor 40.The cutting blades 52 and tips 54 excavate a fact in front of the cutter member 22 until the desired depth of cut is achieved. Then the hydraulic piston ana cylinder assembly 32 is contracted to return the cutter member 22 to the position shown in Figure 4. The prime mover 10 is moved forward slowly while rotation of the cutter member 22 continues. The blades 52 and tips 54 excavate the face of the trench and thereby extend its length In the direction of movement.The prime mover 10 is moved in a direction parallel to the intended location of the trench and the trench is formed at the side of the prime mover.Further1 the bases of the L shaped tips 54 shape the trench to the desired concave shape. Further, the blades 50 remove the spoil from the trench and deposit it on the side of the trench. The stabilising roller 38 rolls along the bottom of the formed trench behind the cutter member 22 and assists in maintaining the cutter member 22 in the desired orientation. The cutting is continued until the trench has been cut to the desired length.Then the arm 18 is raised by extension of the hydraulic piston and cylinder assembly 20 to remove the cutter member 22 from the trench so that the whole assembly can be moved to another location.It is preferred that the cutter member 22 be in alignment with a rear wheel of the prime mover since it is found that in use this reduces steering problems.With the construction shown in the drawings i11 components especially the blades are welded to the rotary cutter member except for the replaceable tips 54 which are bolted on for easy removal.Further, it is envisaged that the hydraulic motor 40 could drive into a planetary gear arrangement to impart rotation to the cutter member 22.A modified form of the present invention similar to that shown in Figures 1 to 4, is illustrated in Figures 5 and 6, like reference numerals are used to denote like parts.In the apparatus shown in Figures 5 and 6, the pivotally mounted arm 18 is bent through a right angle and is pivoted on a pin 19 in the frame member 19.Further, as can be seen in Figure 5, the apparatus comprises an hydraulic piston and cylinder assembly 60 having one end pivotally mounted on the arm 18 and the other end pivotally mounted on the mounting for the rotary cutter member 22. The hydraulic piston and cylinder assembly 60 is contracted or extended as required to maintain the cutter member 22 in a desired orientation with the roller 38 lowermost, as the arm 18 is pivoted between its transport and operative position.Further, as shown in Figure 6, the mounting to the arm 18 preferably comprises a rotatably mounted pin 62 mounted on a socket in the second end of the arm 18. The pin 62 is rigidly connected at one end to a vertical post 64 having its lower end pivotally mounted between the plates 26 or a pin 66. In this embodiment the plates 26 extend continuously downwardly to provide the mounting for the roller 38.Also, in this embodiment the hydraulic piston and cylinder assembly for tilting the cutter member 22 is horizontally dispersed having one end pivotally connected to the upper end of the post 64 by a bracket 34 and the other end pivotally mounted between the plates 26 on a pin 36. The hydraulic piston and cylinder assembly 32 is contracted or extended as described above to obtain the desired amount of tilt of cutter member 22.Modifications and variations such as would be apparent to a skilled addressee are deemed within the scope of the present invention.
