# Electrostatic copying process.

## Abstract
An electrostatic copying process and apparatus capable of forming copies in at least two different ratios. The formation of a copied image involves exposure scanning of the image of an original document and projecting it on a photosensitive member 10 through an optical device 66 . The change of the ratio of copying is achieved by changing the ratio of projection of the image of the document onto the photosensitive member by the optical device, and also changing the speed of scanning.
