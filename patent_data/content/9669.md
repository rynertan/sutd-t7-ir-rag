# Microwave drying of ceramic shell molds.

## Abstract
A method of drying a refractory slurry layer deposited on a mold pattern 10 formed of a thermally fusible material having low heatability by subjection to microwave energy E , to form a shell mold. The mold pattern 10 is coated with a slurry layer and is subjected to microwave energy E suffi cient to heat the refractory slurry. A portion of the liquid phase of the heated slurry is withdrawn while concurrently cooling the slurry and mold pattern to maintain the mold pattern at a temperature subjacent the fusion temperature of the mold pattern material. The mold pattern 10 may be recoated, resubjected concurrently to microwave energy E and with drawal of the liquid phase of the slurry until the slurry is effectively dried in the mold pattern while effectively prevent ing undesirable thermal distortion of the mold pattern.
