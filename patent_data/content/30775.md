# Control circuit in an electrophotographic copying machine.

## Abstract
A copying machine comprises a photoconductive belt 5 which is fed past a number of processing stations in order to make copies. The belt 5 is divided with respect to a refer ence point into image sections, each of which is capable of copy formation. Each image section of belt 5 is subject to deterioration as a function of the number of times a copy has been made with the aid of that image section. A control cir cuit 100, 110 is provided comprising a counter 102 that for each image section stores the number of copies that has been made with the aid of that image section. The control circuit 100, 110 further comprises means 103, 105, 106, 107 that as a function of the count of the counter 102 for a specific image section adjusts one or more of the processing stations of the copying machine when such a processing station is active on that specific image section. The control circuit 110 further comprises means 116, 120, 121, 122, 123, 126 to prevent copy formation on a specific image sec tion when that image section cannot be used anymore in copy formation either because the number of times it has been used in copy formation has reached a maximum or because it has been damaged in some way so that it cannot be used anymore in copy formation.
