# Secondary beat signal cancel circuit for magnetic reproducing apparatus.

## Abstract
A magnetic reproducing apparatus is provided with an improved secondary beat signal cancel circuit for reducing a secondary beat signal of a low frequency converted chroma signal leaked into a reproduced luminance signal without deteriorating a vertical resolution at an edge portion of an oblique check signal. A secondary beat signal cancel operation is stopped during a period in which no vertical correlation exists be tween the edge portions of two succeeding horizontal lines of the oblique check signal.
