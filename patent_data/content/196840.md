# IMPROVEMENTS IN BALE ACCUMULATORS

## Abstract
A bale accumulator 10 is provided with a bale discharge device 112 at its inlet to receive bales from the discharge end of a baler. The discharge device has a longitudinal passage in which bales moving along the passage are retained until a bale pushes against the rear gate 162 to allow hinged side wall sections 116 to swing outwardly and drop the bale to the ground in front of the forward diverter gate of the accumula tor. The discharge device thus helps to prevent the inlet of the bale accumulator from being blocked when a dense amount of material is being baled by bringing a bale into the accumulator over an existing bale.
