# Tubular connection having a parallel chevron thread.

## Abstract
A thread form is shown for a tubular connection of the type having a pin member 13 adapted to be made up with a box member 15 to form a pipe joint. The pin member 13 has pin threads with thread crests 17 and thread roots 19 which are adapted to be made up with a mating box mem ber 15 having a complimentary thread structure. The pin thread crests 17 are formed between a stab flank 25 and a load flank 27 of the pin thread. The pin thread has a chev ron shaped load flank 27 for engaging a mating chevron shaped load flank of the complimentary box member 15 to provide a chevron type interfit between the load bearing flanks. The load flanks 43 of the pin member includes an outer wall portion 43 with a positive slope which provides additional clearance between the complimentary threads on the pin 13 and box members 15 during disassembly to prevent inadvertent hanging up of the threads.
