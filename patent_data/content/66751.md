# Fuel cell provided with electrolyte plate made of electrical insulating long fibers.

## Abstract
A fuel cell provided with an electrolyte retaining plate made of electrical insulating long fibers such as lithium aluminate long fibers which have preferably a length of 100 to 400 µm and a diameter of 1 to 4 µm, are interlocked each other and have vacant spaces for filling an electrolyte can be constructed and operated safely without damaging the electrolyte retaining plate for a long period of time.
