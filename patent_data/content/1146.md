# Charge coupled device.

## Abstract
In bulk ccd s the non linearity in the input characteristic caused by varactor effects is removed by moving the potential well in which the charge packets are generated below the input electrode to the surface where the centre of electrical charge is substantially independent of the value of the charge. Said shift can be obtained by external means, for example an extra d.c. voltage at the input electrode, or by internal means, for example thicker oxide below the input electrode.
