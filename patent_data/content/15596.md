## Abstract
An accumulation mode CCD converts into electrical signals an electromagnetic radiation pattern e.g. of infra red radiation. The device body 1 may be of monocrystal line silicon and has a radiation sensitive region 2 which is of one conductivity type determined by dopant e.g. sulphur, platinum, indium or thallium having an energy level or levels sufficiently deep in the semiconductor band gap that substantially all of said dopant atoms are un ionized at the device operating temperature. By this means said region 2 is substantially free of majority charge car riers in the absence of said radiation, and majority charge carriers trapped by said dopant atoms can be released upon excitation by the radiation. A first ohmic contact 5, 6 to said region 2 supplies majority charge carriers to said dopant to replace charge carriers released by the incident radiation. An electrode system 11 to 14 on one major side of the region 2 permits electric fields to be capac itively generated in the region 2 for accumulating the re leased majority carriers below the electrode system 11 to 14 as charge packets corresponding to the incident radia tion pattern and for transporting said charge packets later ally across the region 2 to an output 15, 16 from the region 2 . Instead of the Figure 1 arrangement, the con tact 5, 6 may be at the same side as the electrode system 11 to 14 instead of the opposite side, and a single phase CCD electrode system possibly with a rectifying junction instead of an insulating layer 17 may be used. The de vice is converted from a surface channel to a bulk channel CCD by the addition of a surface layer 20 of said one conductivity type at the said one major side of said region 2 below the electrode system 11 to 14 .
