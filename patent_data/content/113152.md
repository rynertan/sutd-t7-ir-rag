# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR EXAMINING ANOMALIES ON SURFACES OF OBJECTS

## Abstract
Diseased areas of human teeth are identified by an orange red fluorescence which is produced when the teeth are illuminated with visible light having a wavelength of less than approximately 434.5 nm. The teeth are viewed directly through an optical filter which blocks transmission at the illuminating wavelength. A peaking filter may be used to enhance the visibility of the fluorescence.
