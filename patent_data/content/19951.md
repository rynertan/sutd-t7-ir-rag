# Process for welding gypsum bodies.

## Abstract
The process mainly consists of spot heating the gypsum parts to be welded until the dehydrotation temperature is reached adding water and finally pressing together said gypsum parts until complete hardening of the joint.

## Description
Process for plaster jointing.The present invention covers a process for jointing plaster.Presently plaster is widely applied in the building industry, where plaster slabs or especially plaster carboard slabs are the most suitable material for partition walls or wall and ceiling linings Such slabs are widely used, both in traditional and pre fab building.Although many means exist already to fasten these slabs together, the necessity is felt to have the disposal of a process to anchor plaster to plaster. This is the case e.g. when end sides of plaster cardboard slabs are to be bevelled according to a process disclosed in the Applicant s Belgian Patent No. 867.143. Said process enables to bevel the end sides of plaster cardboard slabs without damaging the cardboard wrapping and consists of providing, after manufacture of the slabs, sufficiently deep and wide saw cuts over the entire length of the end sides, filing up the cuts with a suitable glue and subsequently pressing the fork shaped end sides of the slabs together until solidification of said glue.This process has proved most efficient in practice, but filling the saw cuts with glue appears to be rather complicated in certain cases, whereas the hardening process, dependent on the kind of glue used, is relatively slow in progress. Therefore the Applicant has searched for a simple as well as. cheap solution to anchor plaster to plaster quicker and more efficiently.Thus the Applicant found that, unlike the usual methods requiring adhesives, cement and the like, the intrinsic physical properties of plaster can be used in a very simple way to obtain a strong joint.As is generally known, plaster mostly appears as the monocrystal dihydrate CaSOd.2K20, a hard and solid mass, which is only little soluble in water.Moreover it is known that, depending on temperature, pressure and heating time, the crystal water may be completely or partially extracted from the plaster.When plaster is critically heated, up to a temperature of about 1600 Centigrade, hemi or half hydrate, possibly soluble hexagonal anhydrite, sometimes called burnt gypsum, is formed. Hemihydrate appears as a white powder and when, after cooling down it is again contacted by water, the microcrystals will dissolve and re crystallize as dihydrate, which involves an increase in volume and integration of long needles into a hard mass. Hemihydrate absorbs water particularly fast and re crystallization into a hard solid mass occurs very quickly.The Applicant found that the reversible processEMI2.1 can be favourably applied for jointing plaster.In practice, critical spot heating of plaster up to about 100 to 200Q Centigrade can be effected in different ways and the most appropriate method will probably depend on the specific application.Thus te friction heat set free during saw cutting in end sides of pl aster cardboard siabs may e.g. be used for partial dewatering of the plaster, provided however that saw friction neat actually reaches the desired dewatering temperature. in the saw cut, the powdery hemihydrate will then arise, which is brought into contact with water, so that the dihydrate re appears locally. Then it is a matter of quickly bringing together the parts to be jointed before the dihy rate folnt solidifies and hardens. the present case it may be necessary, depending on the amount of heat set free whilst sawing, to cool down the saw the plaster temperature low enough to pre ent formation of insoluble orthorhombic anhydrite. is cooling o operation may e.g. be favourably effected by using ita le means to introduce water into the saw cut during sawing. This cooling water will then be partially re absorbed bv the eihydrate to build up the joint as soon as the temperature has lowered sufficiently.However, he temperature does not rise high enough du rn ng sawing, it will do to feed a suitable amount of water after sawing is finished. Also, after completing the afore mentioned saw cut, either having c oled it or not, the saw cut walls may be suitably heated, e.g. by radiation heat, in order to obtain the same result as described above.Said radiation heat could e.g. be obtained by heating the afore mentioned saw cut wall by means of an incandescent heater element or the like. afore mentioned walls could also be heated by convec tion.Of course the process described above by way of example could be applied with equal advantage for a great many other applications where plaster jointing is needed and possibly by using practical alternatives to the process according to the invention, which however do not exceed its specific scope.
