## Description
PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF ANILINE DERIVATIVES This invention relates to a process for the preparation of aniline derivatives. It is well known that aromatic compounds can be alkylated in the aromatic nucleus by reaction with various alkylating agents in the presence of a pro tonic acid or a Lewis acid as catalyst. This is the FriedelCrafts reaction. A very wide range of acidic catalysts have been used to prepare a wide variety of alkyl substituted benzene derivatives. Such reactions are of great importance and of wide applicability. They can however suffer from two principle disadvantages. First, it can be rather difficult to prevent di alkylation of the benzene nucleus, since the first product formed, the mono alkylated product, tends to be more reactive than the starting material. Thus it is often necessary to conduct the reaction in such a way that only a relatively small proportion of the aromatic starting material reacts, and then to separate out the product or products formed, and re cycle the starting material. On an industrial scale, such procedures can be very costly. Secondly, when using certain substituted benzenes as starting materials, alkyl substitution can lead to two or more positional isomers. In sone cases, one isomer is formed in large excess over the other possible isomers in many cases however the reaction is relatively unspecific, and mixtures of some or all of the possible isomers are formed. German Auslegeschrift No. 1,051,271, describes a Friedel Crafts process for the nuclear alkylation of anilines. The major products produced are monoor di alkyl anilines with the alkyl group or groups ortho to the amino group. In addition, N alkyl products are often produced. When using 2 methylaniline and propene as starting materials, the products obtained were 2 methyl 6 isopropylaniline and a large proportion of diisopropyl 2methylanilines. When using 4methyl aniline and propene as starting materials, the only product isolated was 2,6 diisopropyl 4 nethylaniline. No process capable of commercial application is known to the Applicants whereby 3,4 dialkylanilines or N alkyl derivatives thereof can be prepared by nuclear alkylation with reasonable selectivity and yield to the desired product. It is an object of the present invention to provide such a process. The invention therefore provides a process for the preparation of a compound of the general formulaEMI2.1 in which each of R1 and R2 independently represents an alkyl group and each of R3 and R4 independently represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group, which comprises reacting a compound of the general formulaEMI3.1 in which R1, R3 and R4 have the meanings given above, with an alkylating agent selected from an alkene, an alkyl halide, an alkanol, an alkyl ester of a carboxylic acid, or a dialkyl ether, the reaction being conducted in the liquid phase in the presence of hydrogen fluoride. Any alkyl group represented by R1, R2, R3 orR4 preferably has up to 6, especially up to 4, carbon atoms. Preferably R1 represents a methyl group.Preferably R2 represents an isopropyl group. Preferably both R3 and R4 represent hydrogen atoms. An alkene, alkanol, alkyl halide, alkyl ester of a carboxylic acid or dialkyl ether may be used in the process of the present invention, the particular choice depending of course on the desired alkyl group R2. As is normal in Friedel Crafts reactions, the alkyl groupR2 introduced into the aniline nucleus may in some cases be a different group from an alkyl group present in the alkylating agent. Usually, products in which R2 is a tertiary or secondary group rather than a primary group predominate when R2 has 3 or more carbon atoms.For example, an isopropyl group R2 can be introduced by the use of either isopropyl chloride or n propyl chloride as alkylating agent under the reaction conditions, the same transient intermediate is formed and leads mainly to isopropylation of the aniline nucleus. In general, the use of an alkene or an alkyl halide is preferred in the process according to the invention.For reasons of cost, an alkyl chloride is usually the preferred alkyl halide. The use of alkanols produces an efficient reaction, but this reaction generates water, as does the use of dialkyl ethers. While this does not affect the course of the reaction, it may cause handling difficulties since water containing HF is more corrosive than anhydrous HF. For this same reason, all reagents used in the process according to the invention should preferably be relatively dry, although the presence of the amounts of water normally found in commercial reagents presents no problem. Thus when preparing a compound of the general formula I in which R2 represents an isopropyl group, the alkylating agent is preferably a 1 or 2 halopropane for example 2 chloropropane, or, especially, propene. Whatever alkylating agent is selected, it is in general preferred to conduct the reaction with incomplete conversion of the aniline to products. In this way the production of compounds containing two R2 groups is minimised.Thus preferably the molar ratio of aniline to alkylating agent is from 1 1 to 5 1, especially in the range of from 1.1 1 to 3 1. However, when using an alkene as alkylating agent, polymerisation may occur as a rapid side reaction, reducing the quantity of alkene available for use in the alkylation reaction such polymerisation is especially rapid at relatively high temperatures. Thus when carrying out the reaction as a batch process, it is usually preferred to use an excess of alkene over aniline to ensure an adequate degree of alkylation. However, a preferred method of utilising an alkene is to meter in the alkene graduall during the course of the reaction, until the desired degree of conversion of the aniline is obtained. This method of operation can of course also be used for alkylating agents other than alkenes if desired. It is believed, but not confirmed, that whatever the alkylating agent used, the first step is the formation of an alkyl fluoride. As compounds of this type are usually gaseous, the process according to the invention is suitably carried out in a contained system to prevent escape of material from the reaction mixture. If desired, the reaction may be carried out under a pressure in excess of atmospheric pressure, for example under an atmosphere of an inert gas, such as nitrogen. Excess pressures of up to 20 bars, preferably up to 10 bars, may for example be used. Higher pressures are of course possible, but are generally undesirable for economic reasons. The boiling point of hydrogen fluoride at atmospheric pressure is 19 C, and so in general the use of pressures greater than atmospheric are necessary of it is desired to conduct the reaction at temperatures higher than this. The reaction temperature is not critical. Suitably the reaction is carried out at a temperature in the range of from 30 to 800C, for example 30 to 400C, especially 15 to 400C. For handling reasons, it is generally preferred to use excess liquid HF as a solvent for the reaction, for example at least 15 moles of HF per mole of aniline II, and preferably the aniline compound of the general formula II,the alkylating agent and the liquid HF are the only species present in the reaction mixture at the beginning of the reaction. In such a case, the mixture can be worked up after the reaction in a very simple manner, involving evaporation of the HF. However, other species may be present if desired. For example, an inert solvent or diluent may be present aliphatic hydrocarbons, for exapmle pentane, hexane or octane, and inert cyclic ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, are examples of suitable compounds.Other possible additives to the reaction mixuture include certain non metal halides, such as boron trifluoride or antimony pentafluoride, and strong inorganic acids, for example monofluorosulphuric acid. Such compounds tend to increase the acid strength of the reaction mixture, and may lower the temperature at which a given rate of reaction is attainable, or increase the rate of reaction at a given temperature. In general, the compound of the general formula I is of course initially present in the reaction mixture in the form of its hydrofluoride salt. This may be isolated as such, or converted by known methods into the free aniline or any other acid addition salt, as desired. A convenient method of isolation is as the hydrochloride salt. The hydrochloride salt of 3 methyl 4 isopropylaniline can be precipitated out from an organic solution containing other isomeric methylisopropylanilines, by bubbling an equivalent amount of HC1 to the 3 methyl 4 isopropylaniline, through the solution. The process according to the invention is capable of producing the desired compound in which the R2 group is para to the NR3R group, in high selectivity compared with the other possible isomers and compared to compounds containing two R2 groups. As shown in cemparative Examples 5 to 8 herein, the use of various acidic materials known to be generally useful as catalysts in Friedel Crafts reactions leads to a far less selective reaction for a given level of conversion of aniline starting material, or to no reacting at all. The compound of the general formula I in which RÚ is methylRê is isopropyl and R and R4 are both hydrogen, can be readily converted by methods analogous to known methods into the compound methyl 4 isopropylphenyl dimethylurea, which is an extremely potent selective herbicide for the control of weeds r cereal crops. Thus the invention also provides a process for the preparation of said urea, which process includes the step of preparing the compound 3 methyl4 isopropylaniline by the process according to the invention. Conversion of the aniline to the urea may for example be carried out by reaction of the aniline with a dimethylcarbamoyl halide, or by reaction of the aniline with phosgene gollowed by reaction with dimethylamine. The following Examples illustrate the invention.Analyses were carried out by NMR and or by gas liquid chromatography. All percentage yields given are GIC area percentages.Examples 1 to 4 C.2 mol 3 methylaniline were dissolved in 1CCmls liquid hydrogen fluoride in a plastic container. The resulting solution was then sucked into an evacuated autoclave made of Hastelloy C Trade Mark . The autoclave was pressurised to 4 bars with nitrogen, propene was then introduced, and the reaction mixture was maintained at the stated temperature for the stated reaction time.The hydrogen fluoride was then evaporated off and the products were analysed. The results are given in TableI below 3 MA 3 methyl aniline 3 M 4IA 3 methyl 4 isopropylaniline Table IExample Propene Temp Reaction Conversion of Product distribution No added C time 3 MA 3 M 4IA diisopropyl moles hours to products compounds 1 0.5 10 4 15 85 0 2 0.65 10 24 56 77 11 3 0.90 13 48 75 71 13 4 C.20 0 4 20 81 2 Comparative Experiments A series of experiments were carried out on the alkylation of 3 methylaniline using several Friedel Crafts catalysts, under conditions generally regarded as suitable for those catalysts.Example 5 comparison The general method of Examples 1 to 4 was repeated, except that 1g 3 methylaniline was dissolved in 3g 90X sulphuric acid. Propene was added to a pressure of 5 bars. After conducting the reaction at room temperature for 12 hours, analysis of the products showed that 53 of the starting material had been converted to products 62 of the products was 3 methyl 4 isopropylaniline, and 27X of the products was diisopropyl compounds.Example 6 comparison The method of Example 5 was repeated, except that the propene was replaced by an equivalent amount of isopropanol and the reaction temperature was 80 C, At a conversion of 3 methylaniline to products of 60 , 60 of the products was the desired compound 3 methyl 4 isopropyl aniline. Exactly the same results were obtained when a third of the sulphuric acid was replaced by the very strong acid, molybdic acid, H2M04.Example 7 comparison In a continuous flow system consisting of a column filled with an active acidic clay catalyst K106 Trade Mark, Degussa , were passed 3 methylaniline LHSV 0.67 h 1 and propene GHSV 4.5 x 102 h l at a temperature of 350 C and a total pressure of S bar At 14Z conversion of the aniline the product distribution was 2 isopropyl 5 methylaniline 65 m , 3 methyl 4 isoaropyl aniline 15 m , N isopropyl 3 methylaniline 4 m , the rest being tarry products. Replacement of the active clay catalyst by the acidic ion exchange resin Nafion H Trade Mark, Dupont a perfluorosulphonic acid polystyrene resin, resulted only in tar formation at 1700C. Example 8 comparison Molybdenum carbonyl Mo CO 6, 0,15 mol was dissolved in cyclohexane 120 ml and 3 methylaniline 0.1 mol was added. The reaction mixture was heated under reflux for 2 hours. Analysis of the products showed that very little of the aniline had been converted to products. Examples 9 to lT A 250ml autoclave was evacuated, and liquid hydrogen fluoride was introduced. Over a period of 20 minutes, the desired quantity of 3 methylaniline was pumped in, with cooling, followed by any other reaction components. Finally, the resulting mixture was warmed to the required reaction temperature and the alkylating agent was added gradually. The mixture was stirred for the required reaction time often, for convenience, overnight 152 hours and thereafter the HF was evaporated off and the products analysed by C LC.
