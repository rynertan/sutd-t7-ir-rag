# Perfume release plastic decorations and method of manufacturing.

## Abstract
Decorations resembling stained glass miniatures which release perfume into the atmosphere are manufac tured from perfume containing thermoplastic resin com positions and multiple opening frames. The method of fill ing the resin composition into the openings of the frames provides a secure interlock between the filled resin and the ribs of the frames, and in a preferred procedure, the bottom surface of the filled resin is clarified to improve the trans parency of the filled resin, which is preferably employed in multiple colors.
