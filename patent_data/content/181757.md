# Diaphragm pressure transducers.

## Abstract
A pressure transducer 10 has a sensor beam 14 connected to a diaphragm 18 by a shaft assembly 120 which is made up of a first shaft element 122 attached to the sensor, a second stop element 124 attached to the di aphragm, and rigidifying material 126 connecting the first 122 and second 124 elements. The stop element 124 is formed with a hollow cylindrical portion 125 surrounding the shaft element 122 , and the rigidifying material 126 fills the space between them.
