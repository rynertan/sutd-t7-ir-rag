## Description
The present invention relates to a shift valve for an automatic transmission. A representative example of conventional shift valves is illustrated in Fig. 1. This conventional shift valve for an automatic transmission comprises a spool 10 for switching an oil delivery conduit, a plug 12, and a spring 14 arranged between them. Governor pressure P Various kinds of shift schedule lines are required depending upon different types of engines and different types of vehicles. If, in order to provide a different shift schedule line, the valve bore, spool and plug are redesigned in configuration, numerous kinds of valve bodies, spools and plugs must be manufactured, complicating manufacturing of and management of component parts, and pushing up cost as well. Thus, it is quite advantageous if a different shift schedule line is provided only by replacing the spring. However, in the case of the above mentioned conventional shift valve for automatic transmission, replacing the spring will result in a change in only a portion of the shift schedule line. That is, with the conventional shift valve, it is not possible to vary the line portion A by changing the characteristic of the spring. A shift valve according to the preamble part of Claim 1 is known from reference Automatische Automobilgetriebe by J. St체per Springer Verlag 1965 on pages 322 to 339 showing a DAIMLER BENZ automatic transmission. Particularly, the preamble part of Claim 1 is based on the shift valve which is shown in Figure 301 of the afore mentioned document. The 1 2 shift valve of the Daimler automatic transmission, shown in Figure 301 includes a spool 5 which is urged in the downshift direction by the throttle pressure and a first spring located between a plug 4 and the spool and in the upshift direction by the governor pressure and a second spring. The force of the second spring is stronger than the force of the first spring, whereby the transmission is shifted in the second speed at zero speed and zero throttle in order to avoid creep. It is an object underlying the present invention to provide a shift valve for an automatic transmission which can provide a desired different shift schedule line by merely replacing spring means thereof, such that the shift valve upshift is prohibited until a governor pressure obtains a predetermined value, even if the magnitude of the total pressure is substantially zero. The solution of this object is achieved by the features of Claim 1. Referring to Figs. 3 and 4, the present invention is hereinafter described. Fig. 3 shows a shift valve for an automatic transmission according to the present invention. This shift valve comprises a spool 22 and a plug 24 which are slidably fit in a valve bore formed in a valve body 20. At the both ends of the valve bore, retainers 32 and 34 are mounted by pins 26 and 28, respectively. Between the spool 22 and the plug 24 is arranged a first spring 36. Between the retainer 32 and the spool 22 is arranged a second spring 38. A force of the second spring 38 is smaller than a force of the first spring 36. The valve body 20 is formed with oil grooves 20a to 20h. The oil groove 20a is connected to a throttle pressure circuit. The oil grooves 20b and 20f are connected to a kickdown pressure circuit. The oil groove 20c is a drain port. The oil groove 20d is connected to a circuit that communicates with a clutch 40. The port 20e is connected to a circuit that communicates with a source of oil pressure 42. The ports 20g and 20h are connected to a governor pressure circuit which receives governor pressure representative of vehicle speed. When not in a kickdown state, the ports 20b and 20f are drained. In this state, a leftward force due to governor pressure P
