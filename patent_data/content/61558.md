# Chemiluminescent device.

## Abstract
In chemical light devices comprising a chemilumines cent mixture with a first fluorescer contained in a transparent or translucent container, a second fluorescer is incorporated in the walls of the container to shift at least part of the emissions from the device from the shorter wavelength emission of the first fluorescer to a longer wavelength emission of the second fluorescer. The second fluorescer has an absorption spectrum substantially overlapping the emis sion spectrum of the first fluorescer. The shift is usually about 20 to 100 nanometers and may be as much as 200 nanometers.
