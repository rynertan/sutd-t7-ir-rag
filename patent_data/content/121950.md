# Magnetic field sensor.

## Abstract
A magnetic field sensor comprising a magnetic field sensitive element 1 , more specifically a magnetic field sensitive multi collector transistor 2 , is described. To re duce the offset, the setting of this element is modulated to vary the sensitivity, by varying the voltage at the sources 15 or 19 . A clock generator 25 is in this example connected with source 19 and the sampling circuits 21, 22 and the diffe rential amplifier 23 . In the variation of the output signal of that element 1 in response to the variation in the sensitivity the offset has then been reduced.
