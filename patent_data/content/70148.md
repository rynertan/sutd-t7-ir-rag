# Method and apparatus for monitoring particles in a liquid medium.

## Abstract
An improved method and apparatus for producing Ferrograms in which centrifugal force is used to facilitate the spread of a deposit of magnetically or electrically polarised or polarisable particles led at 1 onto a substrate 3 to facilitate subsequent optical analysis of the particles. In a preferred arrangement, a transparent disc 3 is rotated with a magnet 6 in a holder 5 about an axis 7 to spread the particle deposit, from a liquid medium fed to the upper surface 2 of the disc 3 , radially outwards of its circle of application.
