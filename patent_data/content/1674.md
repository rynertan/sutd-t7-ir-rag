# Wheel probe for ultrasonic inspection of pipelines.

## Abstract
A wheel probe for use on a pipe inspection vehicle. The wheel probe comprises an annular outer rim 22 with a polyurethane tyre 32 mounted on a hub assembly which, with the hub, defines a fluid tight chamber containing an acoustic coupling fluid. A number of ultrasonic transducers are located inside the chamber and are positioned close to the inside circumferential surface of the rim 22 . The hub assembly is carried by a spring loaded carriage which is secured to the vehicle. The wheel probe includes a guide guide wheel 39 on each side. The guide wheels 39 are carried by the carriage but are moveable bodily relative to the centre of the hub assembly, and when deflected, they operate on the assembly to move the wheel probe to ensure that the outer rim 22 of the wheel is correctly aligned relative to the pipe 11 . The wheel probe has a number of shields 33 spaced around its periphery. The gaps between the shields define operating windows through which the rim 22 of the wheel probe projects to contact the pipe 11 . The shields 33 are located close to the bore of the pipe 11 so that if the probe encounters an obstruction the shield 33 snages on the obstruction, is pulled between the rim 22 and the pipe 11 to lift the wheel over the obstruction, and turns on to the next operating window . Cam followers 37 a are provided to hold the shields 33 in position.
