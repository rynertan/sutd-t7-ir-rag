# Optical position determining apparatus.

## Abstract
An optical position indicating apparatus comprising a light source 30, detector means 28 for detecting the presence of light and producing an electrical output in response to it, reflecting means 16 for reflecting light from the light source 30 across a target zone 14, and retroreflecting means 18, 20, 24 for reflecting light incident upon their back along a path sub stantially coincident with its path of incidence. The retroref lecting means comprise a plurality of retroreflective assemb lies 18, 20, 24 disposed around the target zone and limiting means 49 limit the detector means 28 to a finite viewing range so that rotation of the detector means 28 scans the target zone 14. The detector means 28 is capable of measuring angular displacement from a reference position so that the presence of an opaque object within the target zone registers upon the detector means as a plurality of shadows thereby resulting in the absence of an electrical output from the detector means for each of the plurality of shadows. The location of the opa que object 59 in two dimensions within the target zone 14 is then determined from the angular displacements of the plur ality of shadows, for example by geometric calculation.
