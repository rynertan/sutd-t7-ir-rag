## Description
The present invention relates to novel compounds having general formulaEMI1.1 wherein R and R have the following meanings EMI1.2 More specifically, the present invention relates to SJ2 ,4 d ifluoro i hydroxy 1,1 d ipheny l c arbonyl,LN acety l L cyste ine and N 2 ,4 d ifluoro 4 hydroxy l,l diphe nyl carbonyl carboxymethylcysteine and their O carbonyloxyalky and O acetyl derivatives, as well as their non toxic and pharmaceutically acceptable salts with organic and inorganic bases. The present invention also relates to their preparation method and to their therapeutical use in the treatment of the catarrhal diseases of the tracheobronchial tract, by administration either orally and or by rectal, aerosol and injective route.The pathology of the respiratory system is among the very first in the classification of the main causes of illness.Among the respiratory diseases, the most frequent are undoubtedly those affecting the tracheobronchial tract, both in the acute and in the chronic form.Leaving the pure broncho spastic forms out of consideration as being percentually a minority, these diseases are characterized by a phlogystic state of the tracheobronchial mucosa and by a frequently exceedingly viscous secretion. The pharmacological therapy of tracheo bronchitis exempt from complications does classically contemplate the use, from one side, of mucolytic fluidifying and balsamic agents and, from the other side, of anti phlogistic, and antitpyretic agents endowed with analgesi properties taking also into account that the acute influenzal and parainfluenzal formas commonly found often are accompanied by fever and arthromyalgia.From the above considerations the utility appears of getting a drug capable of simultaneously acting on the phlogistic and catarrhal component, also providing ar.anti pyretic and analgesic activity.The compounds of the present invention in fact combine mucolytic properties with an anti inflammatory, analgesic and anti pyretic activity they are represented by the formula 1 and are thus thioesters and amides comprising two molecular moyeties, that of the 2 4 difluoro 4 hydroxy 1,1 diphenyl 3 carboxylic acid, also known under theD.C.I. diflunisal , which is a substance known for its anti inflammatory properties, and that of N acetylcysteine or of S carboxymethylcysteine, which are substances known for their mucolytic properties.As already mentioned the present invention does also contemplate the non toxic and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of the present invention among them of particular interest is the lysine salt of compound 5 .The compounds of formula 1, whereinEMI2.1 are prepared by converting the 2,4 difluoro 4 hydroxy 1,1 diphenyl 3 carboxylic scid into the corresponding mixed anhydrides by the reaction with 2,2,2 trichloroethyl chiorocarbonate or et hylchlorocaoonat in the presence of an acid acceptor, a condensation of these intermediates with N acetylcysteine, the O alky3carbonate thioesters being then hydrogen to the corresponding phenolic thioesters, as shown in the scheme L An advantageous modification of the method for the preparation of the final compound 5 consists in preparing the mixed anhydride 3 with R CH2 CC13 with a like process, in the presence of an excess both of trichloroethylchlorocarbonate and of triethylami ne, so that the mixed anhydride s isolated in a sufficiently pure form, the latter being then reacted with N acetyl L cysteine, still in presence of triethylamine.By this route, through a subsequent addition of triethylamine excess, the product 5 is isolated as the triethylamine salt 5 , whereby the hydrogenolysis step of the compound of formula 4 to the final product 5 is eliminated.Both processes are shown in the scheme I.The compounds of formula 1 whereinEMI3.1 are prepared through the condensation of the O acetyl derivative of 2 ,4 difluoro4 hydroxy 1,1 diphenyl 3 carboxylic acid with the dimethyl ester of S carboxymethylcysteine in the presence of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and alkaline hydrolysis of the thus obtained amide derivative as shown in the scheme 11. In this scheme the preparation is also shown of the compound 1 whereinEMI3.2 through the condensation of the acid chloride of 2 ,4 difluoro 4 hydroxy 1,1 dipbeny l 3 carboxy lic acid with N acetylcysteine.

It is interesting to note that compound 5 has a definitely lower toxicity than the equimolar mixture of the two single components.

TABLE 3Pharmacokinetic parameters calculated on the basis of the plasma levels of diflunisal after administration of 5 2 ,4 d 2 ,4 difluoro 4 hydroxy 1,1 diphenyl 3 carbonyl N ace tyl L cysteine compound 5 and of diflunisal at the oral dose of 0.04 mmol kg in the rat. tTREATMENT C max C max t 0 00 g ml 1 h h g.h.ml 1Compound 5 15.0 8 5.8 271.96Diflunisal 39.7 3 4.2 344.78Also the tissue levels of diflunisal in the lungs have been measured since these tissues represent the sites of the therapeutical action foreseen for the compound 5.The behaviour of these levels in the lungs is alike to that observed in the plasma, but in this case the AUCO 24h of compound 5 is higher than that of diflunisal and precisely is 105 . Such a value, if compared with that relating to the plots of the plasma levels indicates a preferential tropism of the compound 5 for the lung tissue.The presence in the compounds of the invention, in an equilibrated ratio, of antiinflammatory and mucolytic activity corresponding to those of the diflunisal and of the N acetylcysteine respectively, does already represent an advantagel J snarseteristic since it permits to obtain, in the afore said pathologies, a desirable double therapeutical action, through the administration of only one substance, which is easier to carry out than the extemporary association of the two aforesaid active principles.However the most important advantages of the compounds of the inveniton with respect to the extemporary association of the two active principles are represented by the scarce toxicity of the compound 5, which is surprisingly less than that of the diflunisal and of an equimolar mixture of diflunisal and N acetylcysteine, by the favorable pharmacokinetic properties longer apparent halflife, preferential tropism for the lungh tissue, etc. and moreover by the lack of local irritating effects, which permits the use of the compounds of the invention in form of pharmaceutical preparation suitable, besides for the oral administration, also for the aerosol, rectal and injecting administration, these routes being on the contrary prohibited for the diflunisal, as confirmed by experiments carried out by the Applicant.For these reasons the compounds of the present invention may find useful indications of use in the acute and chronical diseases of the tracheo bronchial tract and in the influenzal and para influenzal forms in which the respiratory organs are involved.The compounds of the invention are prepared as described in the following examples. EXAMPLE 1 S l 2 ,4 d if luoro 4 2,2,2 tr ichloroethox ycarbony loxy 1,1 d ipheny 1 3 carbonyJ7 N acetylcysteine compound 4 with R CH2 CCl3 .
