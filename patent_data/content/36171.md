# Electrochemical sensing apparatus with in situ calibration and method of making same.

## Abstract
An in vivo electrochemical monitoring device is formed by a catheter like tube 10, 14 which terminates in a closed end 24 having a wall with a fixed opening 11, 18 to admit fluid to be tested, such as blood in an artery. An electrochemical sensor 9, 19, such as an ISFET device 20 for monitoring the concentra tion of a particular ion in blood, is mounted inside the tube 10, 14 at a fixed location below the opening 11, 18 preferably a larger sensing chamber. An infusion channel 12, 15 in the tube 10, 14 is arranged to flood the sensor 9, 19 with a fluid of known chemical properties so that the sensor output can be cali brated. Under pressure the calibration fluid expels the test fluid out of the tube 10, 14 or chamber via the fixed opening 11, 18. A method of constructing a suitable chamber on an ISFET wafer is also disclosed.
