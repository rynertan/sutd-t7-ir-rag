# Detergent compositions.

## Abstract
High concentration 60 80 active matter detergent compositions in the form of stable, translucent, mobile gels based on dialkyl sulphosuccinates and alkyl ether sulphates, and containing a lower alcohol and water, are disclosed. For stability, the ratio of lower alcohol to water should be below a certain critical value that varies with the total active detergent level.
