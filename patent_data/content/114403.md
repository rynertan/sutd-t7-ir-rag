## Description
MULTILAYER ANALYTICAL ELEMENT BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the invention The present invention relates to a multilayer analytical element, and more particularly to a multilayer analytical element suitable for analysis of a low diffusive substance contained in body fluids.Description of prior arts As a method of analysis of substance contained in a liquid sample such as a body fluid in a small amount, there has been conventionally utilized a wet analysis such as a method comprising steps of bringing said substance into contact with other substances contained in a solvent so as to undergo a detectable reaction such as a reaction directly or indirectly producing or changing color, and detecting said reaction. However, a dry analysis developed for the purpose of simplifying the analytical procedures has been recently utilized. As a representative example of the analytical elements utilized for the dry analysis, well known is a multilayer analytical element also called a multilayer analytical material or article which is in the form of a sheet, film, strip or tape basically comprising at least one reagent layer containing a reagent which directly or indirectly undergoes detectable reaction in contact with the substance under analysis analyte , and a support thereof.The analysis employing the multilayer analytical element is generally carried out by procedures of applying a liquid sample containing the analyte onto the multilayer analytical element, subjecting the multilayer analytical element to incubation if necessary, measuring thus produced detectable reaction such as generation or change of color by means of a photometry or the like, and determining the amount of analyte according to colorimetry. There are known a variety of analytical systems utilized in analysis of analyte employing a multilayer analytical element. Representative examples of the analytical system are as follows. A An analytical system for detecting and measuring a detectable reaction between a reagent contained in a reagent layer and an analyte such as generation or change of color. The analytical system is employed for analysis of analyte such as a variety of proteins, for instance, total protein, albumin and globulin, a hemoglobin decomposition substance, for instance, free nonconjugated or indirect bilirubin or conjugated direct bilirubin. B An analytical system employing a reagent layer containing at least two kinds of reagents, which comprises procedures of reacting one of the reagent with analyte to produce a reactive substance such as ammonia or hydrogen oxide, subsequently reacting the reactive substance with other reagent e.g. dye precursor in contact therebetween to cause a detectable reaction such as generation or change of color, and detecting and measuring the reaction. The analytical system is employable for analysis where analytes are glucose lipids such as cholesterol, trigliceride and free fatty acid enzymes such as lactate dehydrogenase urea and uric acid. C An analytical system employing a reagent layer containing a non diffusive reagent having a color forming group, which comprises procedures of converting the reagent into a diffusive product carrying the colorforming group by reaction with analyte, separating the diffusive product from the unreacted non diffusive reagent, causing a detectable reaction such as generation or change of color in contact between the diffusive product and a chromogen substance such as coupler, and detecting and measuring the reaction. The analytical system is employable for analysis of polysaccharide hydrolase such as amylase. D An analytical system employing a reagent layer containing a non diffusive reagent having a detectable property e.g., color , which comprises procedures of producing a diffusive product carrying the detectable property from the reagent by reaction with analyte, separating the diffusive product from the unreacted nondiffusive reagent, and detecting and measuring the diffusive product. The analytical system is employable for analysis of polysaccharide hydrolase such as amylase. The object of the present invention is to provide a multilayer analytical element employable for the aboveexemplified analytical system A , that is, an analytical system comprising detection of a detectable reaction between a reagent contained in a reagent layer and an analyte such as generation or change of color. The present invention provides a multilayer analytical element particularly suitable for analysis of high molecular weight analyte such as a variety of proteins e.g. total protein, albumin and globulin, or analyte such as hemoglobin decomposition substances e.g. free unconjugated bilirubin and conjugated bilirubin, as well as analysis of hydrophobic analyte. More in detail, the reagent layer of the known multilayer analytical element is generally made of a hydrophilic colloid such as a hydrophilic synthetic polymer or a hydrophilic natural polymer. In the reagent layer of the multilayer analytical element employed for the above described purpose, the hydrophilic colloid layer contains a reagent producing a detectable reaction such as generation or change of color in contact with the analyte e.g. color precursor or dye . Accordingly, for carrying out the aimed detectable reaction of analyte in the reagent layer within short period of time upon introduction into the multilayer analytical element by applying a liquid sample onto the element, it is required that the analyte rapidly permeates and diffuses inside of the reagent layer so as to uniformly contact the reagent within short period of time.However, the high molecular weight analyte or hydrophilic analyte difficultly permeates and diffuses inside of the conventional reagent layer made of the hidrophilic colloid.Accordingly, it is difficult to perform rapid and accurate analysis. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is, accordingly, an object of the present invention to provide a multilayer analytical element particularly suitable for analysis of analyte being a low diffusive property in a hydrophilic colloid layer such as various proteins, e.g. total protein, albumin and globulin, and hemoglobin decomposition substances, e.g., free bilirubin and conjugated bilirubin. The present invention provides a multilayer analytical element for analyzing analyte in a liquid sample, characterized in that the element comprises. I a porous spreading layer for spreading the liquid sample 11 a porous reagent layer provided in fluid contact with said spreading layer, which contains a reagent producing or changing color by reaction with the analyte and III a liquid impermeable, light transmissive support supporting said reagent layer.

P Curve showing a color formation rate of the multilayer analytical element of the present invention Q curve showing a color formation rate of the multilayer analytical element of Comparison Example 1 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION A multilayer analytical element composed mainly of a liquid impermeable, light transmissive support and a reagent layer of hydrophilic colloid containing a reagent producing or changing color by reaction with analyte has been conventionally employed in a variety of forms using various materials, or proposed for the use.Also a multilayer analytical element composed mainly of a liquid impermeable, light transmissive support and single or plural reagent layers of hydrophilic colloid containing a reagent such as a color precursor or dye producing reaction such as generation or change of color in contact with an analyte has been conventionally employed in various forms using a variety of materials, and proposed for the use. Further known is an art to enhance the analytical quantitativity by providing a porous spreading layer on a reagent layer, and a multilayer analytical element having such spreading layer is also known. The liquid impermeable, light transmissive support and porous spreading layer of the multilayer analytical element of the present invention can be formed by utilizing the conventionally known various materials and forms. Accordingly, the support and spreacing layer constituting the multilayer analytical element of the present invention will be briefly described hereinafter. A support employable for the multilayer analytical elemenet is a supprot which a liquid such as a liquid sample does not permeate and a light passes through.Such support has a function to support a multilayer analytical element, as well as enables to detect or measure the generation or change of color produced in the reagent layer by means of reflection photometry from the support side. Examples of the support include organic resin films such as a cellulose ester film e.g. films of cellulose diacetate, cellulose triacetate and cellulose acetate propionate , a polyethylene terephthalate film, a film of polycarbonate of bisphenol A and a polymethyl methacrylate film, and a glass plate. There is no specific limitation on the thickness of the above described support, but the thickness of the support is generally within the range of approx. 50 iim to approx. 2 mm, from the viewpoint of the aforementioned function. The surface of the support can be provided with a known subbing layer, or subjected to a known chemical treatment such as acid treatment or alkali treatment or physico chemical treatment such as corona discharge, glow discharge, irradiation of ultra violet rays or flame treatment, for the purpose of facilitating the adhesion between the reagent layer or other functional layer and the support. In the present invention, if the multilayer sheet comprising a reagent layer and a spreading layer is a self supporting integral body, the reagent layer and or spreading layer as such can serve as a support. The spreading layer of the multilayer analytical element of the invention is basically located on the outermost side opposite to the light transmissive support across the reagent layer, and a liquid sample containing analyte is spotted onto the surface of the spreading layer in the analytical procedure. The spreading layer is a porous layer having a function to spread thus spotted liquid sample carrying a substance such as analyte therewith over an area proportional to the amount of spotted liquid, and to supply uniformly a specific amount of the sampe liquid per unit area to the reagent layer referred to hereinafter as spreading action or metering action .Owing to the spreading action, the amount of the liquid supplied to the reagent layer through the spreading layer or the amount of analyte containd in the liquid to be supplied to the reagent layer is almost uniform per unit area of the reagent layer, even if the liquid sample is applied to the spreading layer in a varying amount. Accordingly, in the analysis of liquid sample employing the multilayer analytical element provided with a spreading layer having such function, quantitative analysis can be done with high accuracy even if the liquid sample is applied to the spreading layer without accurately measuring the amount in the quantitative analysis. However, this fact does not mean that it is unnecessary to carry out the quantitative analysis by accuratly measuring the amount of liquid sample in the procedure of analysis using the multilayer analytical element of the invention.The accuracy of the aimed quantitative analysis can be further enhanced by accurately measuring the amount of liquid sample. Examples of the porous spreading layer employable for the multilayer analytical element include a nonfibrous isotropic porous layer e.g. a membrane filter or a blushed polymer layer , as described in JapanesePatent Provisional Publication No. 49 1974 53888 Japanese Patent Publication No. 53 1978 21677 andU.S. Patent No. 3992158 an isotropic porous particulate structure layer containing continuous voids of threedimensional lattice structure which is formed by adhesion of fine spherical beads in point contact therebetween by an adhesive agent being not swollen with water, as described in U. S.Patent 4,258,001 a fibrous aniso tropic porous spreading layer made of fabric washed with water or a hydrophilicaly treated fabric, as described in U. S. Patent 2,292,272 a fibrous anisotropic porous spreading layer made of fabric having a physically activated surface, as described in GB 2,087,9074 and a fibrous anisotropic porous spreading layer made of paper, filter paper or nonwoven fabric containing synthetic polymer fibers, as described in Japanese Patent Provisional Publication No. 57 1982 148250. The methods of providing these spreading layer on the multilayer analytical element are disclosed in each of the above described publications, and these methods can be employed in the preparation of the mutilayer analytical element of the present invention. Examples of the matrix serving as a substrate of the porous reagent layer provided on the multilayer analytical element of the present invention include a non fibrous isotropic porous layer e.g. membrane filter or a blushed polymer , an isotropic porous particulate structure layer containing continuous voids of threedimensional lattice structure which is formed through adhesion of fine spherical beads in point contact therebetween by an adhesive agent being not swollen with water, a fibrous anisotropic porous layer made of fabrics, and a fibrous anisotropic porous layer made of paper, filter paper or nonwoven fabric containing synthetic polymer fibers. The porous reagent layer is provided in fluid contact with the aforementioned spreading layer. The fluid contact means herein that the liquid sample applied to the surface of the spreading layer reaches the reagent layer carrying an analyte therein. The reagent layer is not necessarily provided in contact with spreading layer, and other porous layer such as a filter layer may be provided between the spreading layer and the reagent layer in the form of single or plural layers. The reagent layer provided in the multilayer analytical element of the present invention has constitution where a reagent participating in the analysis of the analyte is contained in or attached to the above described porous structure. The reagent employable in the multilayer analytical element of the invention produce or changes color by reaction with the analyte. Examples of the reagent include a color precursor and a dye.These color precursor, dye and the like can be in various forms such as combinations with other low molecular weight compounds or high molecular weight compounds.The reagent layer of the multilayer analytical element can contain, as desired, a variety of additives such as a surface active agent for the purpose of facilitating to uniformly disperse the reagent contained therein and a substance for the purpose of promoting the reaction between the reagent and the analyte. The porous reagent layer of the present invention preferably is a porous matrix composed of a binder containing a reagent producing or changing color through reaction with analyte, and a particulate solid. When a liquid sample having passed through a spreading layer contacts such porous matrix, the liquid sample passes through the continuous space formed among the plural solid fine particles particulate solid and the binder in the porous matrix to rapidly reach overall portion of the binder, and contacts the reagent contained in the binder to produce color formation reaction or color change reaction. There is no specific limitation on the particulate solid employable for formation of the above described preferable matrix, as far as the particulate solid does not give an unfavorable effect to the multilayer analytical element of the invention under reaction between the analyte and the aforementioned various reagents.However, preferred is a transparent, opaque or white particulate solid. Examples of the particulate solid include a fine powder of silicon dioxide such as microcrystalline cellulose, diatomaceous earth or silica gel, a fine silicate powder such as natural and synthetic zeolite, or kaolin, a fine particle of cellulose fibrous material, polymer beads, barium sulfate, and a metal oxide in the form of a fine white powder such as titanium dioxide, aluminum oxide or zinc oxide. There is no specific limitation on the form of particulate solid, and any form such as sphere, column, fibrous or pellet can be optionally employed. In the case that the photometry such as reflection photometry is carried out under conditions that the reaction product to be measured colored product or color changed product is present in the reagent layer containing the above described particulate solids, the particulate solid included in the reagent layer containing the reaction product therein is preferably a low lightreflective particle so as not to reduce the accuracy of photometry. Examples of the particulate solid having low light reflectivity include microcrystalline cellulose, particulate diatomaceous earth, particulate silica gel, zeolite fine powder, particulate cellulose fiber, and polymer beads. In the reagent layer of the multilayer analytical element of the present invention, the reaction product of the analyte and reagent such as a color precursor or dye can be subjected to detection such as through photometry under conditions that the reaction product remains in the reagent layer where the reaction is taken place. However, depending upon the structure of the reagent layer or nature of the reaction between analyte and the reagent, the aimed color formation reaction or color change reaction can proceed further rapidly and uniformly by transferring the reaction product to other layer provided separately from the reagent layer. In the use of the multilayer analytical element of the invention in such analytical system, there can be pro vided a registration layer for receiving the reaction product. The registration layer is provided in fluid contact with the reagent layer and receives the color formation product or color change product produced by the reaction between analyte and the reagent.The fluid contact means herein, as in the aforementioned case, that the reaction product in the reagent layer reaction product showing a color or color change reaches the registration layer with the liquid medium of the liquid sample or an independently introduced spreader liquid. Accordingly, the reagent layer and the registration layer are not necessarily provided in direct contact therebetween, and for instance, other porous layers such as a filter layer can be provided between the reagent layer and the registration layer in the form of single or plural layers. The provision of the above described registration layer is particularly advantageous in the case that the analyte is bilirubin and the detecting agent is a diazonium compound therefor. More in detail, the bilirubin reacts with a diazonium compound to produce azobilirubin azo dye having its absorption spectral peak apparently distinguishable from that of bilirubin. The reaction is further promoted by removing azobilirubin reaction product from the reaction system to shift the equilibrium of the system. For this reason, azobilirubin reaction product between bilirubin and a diazonium compound is sequentially transferred from the reagent layer to the registration layer so as to promote the reaction rate between the unreacted bilirubin and the diazonium compound.As a result, the aimed color changing reaction is remarkably accelerated, so that the period for analytical procedure is reduced and analytical accuracy is further enhanced. The above described registration layer can be made of a known hydrophilic colloid, but the registration layer preferably is a porous layer like the aforemen tioned reagent layer, if the the reaction system involves a high molecular weight reaction product or a hydrophobic reaction product. The porous registration layer is preferably made of a porous matrix composed of a binder and a particulate solid. As the binder, a known hydrophilic polymer can be employed. However, if the reaction product is positively or negatively charged, an electrically charged polymer having electric charge opposite to that of the reaction product is preferably employed as a binder of the registration layer, because the transfer of the above described reaction product from the reagent layer to the registration layer can be accelerated by using such polymer.As the particulate solid employable for the formation of the above described porous registration layer, a low light reflective, particulate solid as mentioned hereinbefore such as microcrystalline cellulose, particulate diatomaceous earth, particulate silica gel, zeolite fine powder, particulate cellulose fibrous material or polymer beads is preferably employed. In the multilayer analytical element of the present invention, a variety of constitution employed for the conventional multilayer analytical elements can be employed. For instance, the multilayer analytical element of the invention may comprise an additional layer such as a ligh reflecting layer, a light blocking layer and an adhesive layer, singly or in combination. The present invention will be further illustrated by the following examples and comparison examples, but these examples are by no means understood to restrict the present invention.

As a result, the same curve as curve P illustrated in Fig. 1 representing the result of Example 8 was obtained.
