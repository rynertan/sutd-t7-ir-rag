FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to novel pharmaceutically useful fluorinated diaminobutane derivatives which are in vivo inhibitors of gamma aminobutyric acid transaminase GABA T . The invention provides the compounds per se, pharmaceutical compositions comprising said compounds, methods of medical treatment using said compounds and processes for preparing said compounds. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The biotransformation of gama aminobutyric acid GABA to succinic acid semialdehyde, which is catalyzed by the enzyme GABA transaminase GABA T , is the primary reaction responsible for the catabolism ofGABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter of the central nervous system. It is known that low levels of endogenous GABA are associated with seizures disorders such as those produced by epilepsy, alcohol withdrawal, or barbiturate withdrawal , with disorders involving involuntary movement such as Huntington s chorea, the extrapyrimidal effect of drugs, for example tardive dyskinesia and certain psychoses such as schizophrenia and mania depression .Blockade of the transformation of GABA to succinic acid semialdehyde, such as by irreversible inhibition of GABA T, can elevate GABA levels in the central nervous system CNS and, thus provides a means for treating those disorders of the central nervous system associated with low GABA levels. Certain compounds are known to be wirreversible inhibitors of GABA T and thereby elevate brain levels of GABA, for example fluorinated methyl gammaaminobutyric acid and certain derivatives thereof seeU.K. Patent Specification No. 2005264A . Further, it is disclosed in U.K. Patent Specification No. 2058052A that fluorinated methyl aminopropionic acids and certain derivatives thereof are also irreversible inhibitors of GABA T. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The compounds of the invention are represented by the following general Formula I EMI3.1 wherein R1 represents hydrogen, C1 C6 alkyl or phenyl C1 C4 alkyl R2 represents hydrogen, C1 C6 alkyl, phenylC1 C4 alkyl or R4, where R4 is as defined below R3 represents hydrogen or, except when R2 represents R4, R4, where R4 is as defined below each R4 independently represents C2 Cs alkyl carbonyl, phenylcarbonyl, phenyl C1 C4 alkyl carbonyl, or an aminocarboxylic acid residue derived by removal of an hydroxy group from the carboxy moiety of an L aminocarboxylic acid and 2 represents 1 or 2 Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of Formula I and individual optical isomers of the compounds of Formula I are also included within the scope of the invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In the above general Formula 1, R1 and R2 can be the same or different and can represent hydrogen,C1 C6, especially C1 C4, alkyl, phenylC1 C4 alkyl, preferably benzyl or phenethyl, or, in the case of R2 only, C2 Cs alkylcarbonyl, phenylcarbonyl, phenyl C1 C4 alkyl carbonyl, or an aminocarboxylic acid residue derived by removal of an hydroxy group from the carboxy moiety of anL aminocarboxylic acid. It is preferred that both R1 and R2 represent hydrogen. In the above general Formula I, R3 represents hydrogen, or, when R2 represents hydrogen, alkyl or phenalkyl, C2 C5 alkylcarbonyl, phenylcarbonyl, phenyl C1 C4 alkyl carbonyl, or an amino carboxylic acid residue derived by removal of an hydroxy group from the carboxy moiety of anL aminocarboxylic acid. Preferably, R3 representsC2 C5 alkylcarbonyl and, especially, hydrogen. When R4 is an aminocarboxylic acid residue, it can be for example, of the formula COCH Rg NH2 or CO CH2 nCH NH2 CO2H wherein Rg is hydrogen, C1 C4 alkyl, aminopropyl, aminobutyl, benzyl or hydroxybenzyl and n is 1 or 2. Examples of aminocarboxylic acids from which said residues are derived include glycine, alanine, leucine, lysine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, glutamic acid and aspartic acid. References in this Specification, including theClaims, to an alkyl group or moiety mean a straight or branched chain alkyl group or moiety and, in the case of an alkyl group or moiety having structural isomers, includes all of those isomers and mixtures thereof unless a particular isomer is specified or clearly implied by the context. Illustrative examples of straight or branched chain alkyl groups or moieties having 1 to 4 carbon atoms are methyl, ethyl, n propyl, iso propyl and n butyl. Illustrative examples of straight or branched chain alkyl groups or moieties having 1 to 6 carbon atoms are those specified above having 1 to 4 carbon atoms and n pentyl, neo pentyl, n hexyl and iso hexyl. In the general Formula I, 2 represents 1 or 2. It will be appreciated that when E represents 1 the compounds of the invention are 1 fluoro 2,4 diaminobutanes and that when p represents 2 they are 1,1difluoro 2,4 diaminobutanes. Illustrative examples of pharmaceutcally acceptable salts.of the compounds of this invention include non toxic acid addition salts formed with inorganic acids, such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, and phosphoric acid, or with organic acids such as organic carboxylic acids, for example, salicylic, maleic, malonic tartaric, citric and ascorbic acids, and organic sulfonic acids, for example, methane sulfonic acid. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the compounds have the following general Formula IA.EMI6.1 wherein p represents 1 or 2. Illustrative compounds of the invention are the following 1 f luoro 2 , 4 diaminobutane l,l difloro 2,4 diaminobutano 1 fluoro 2 amino 4 ethylamino butane l fluoro 2 amino 4 diethylamino butane 1,1 difluoro 2 1 oxopropylamino 4 amino butane N i fluoro 4 amino 2 butyl butyramide N l ,l difluoro 4 amino 2 butyl 2 aminoacetamide 1, 1 dif luoro 2 amino 4 benzylamino butane 1 fluoro 2 benzoylamino 4 amino butane and 1 ,1 difluoro 2,4 di phenylpropionylamino butane The compounds of Formula I in vivo produce irreversible inhibition of GABA T and can elevate GABA levels significantly in the CNS when administered orally or parenterally to warm blooded animals. Thus, the compounds of Formula I are useful for treating disorders in warm blooded animals associated with low levels of GABA in the CNS. For example, the compounds of Formula I are useful. as anti convulsants for the control of seizures involved in epilepsy grand mal and petit mal , alcohol withdrawal, and barbiturate withdrawal. The anti convulsant activity of the compounds can be demonstrated by means of standard test procedures in laboratory animals against experimentally induced seizures. For example, the compounds of Formula I protect mice against clonic seizures induced by bicuculline, when tested according to the procedure of W. Buckett Br.J.Pharm., 68, 177 1980 and Journal of Pharmacological Methods, 5, 35 1981 .The compounds can also protect mice and rats against seizures induced by metrazol clonic and tonic , maximal electroshock tonic , and 3 mercaptopropionic acid clonic and tonic . It should be recognized that certain compounds ofFormula I have shown toxic effects involving convulsions and weight loss ending eventually in death, when administered to mice at certain dosage levels by single or chronic dosages . However, a significant and physiologically useful increase in GABA levels can be demonstrated experimentally in mice at chronic dosages where no lethal toxicity is observed. The dose responses after chronic administration of the hydrochloride salts of 1 fluoro 2,4 diaminobutane and 1,1 difluoro 2,4 diaminobutane with respect to the elevation of brain GABA in mice and the toxicity are shown in Example 10. The ability of the above named compounds to protect animals against clonic seizures induced by bicuculline after a single dose is shown inExample 11. In addition to the anti convulsant uses, the compounds of Formula I are useful for treating disorders involving unvoluntary movement e.g. tardive dyskinesia and or for treating psychoses e.g.schizophrenia and mania depression . Moreover, the compounds of Formula I produce sedation, myorelaxation, anorexia, hypothermia, and or antinociception when administered systemically. The dosage of the compounds of Formula I in warm blooded animals will depend upon the particular compound employed, the severity of the condition being treated, and the mode of administration. In general, an effective dosage capable of providing physiological useful elevation of GABA levels in the CNS can be achieved in warm blooded animals at a dose of from about 0.1 mg kg to about 2.0 mg kg body weight per day administered orally or parenterally. Therapy should be initiated at lower doses, the dosage thereafter being increased in very small increments until the desired effect is achieved. The GABA T inhibitory activity of the compounds can be demonstrated in laboratory animals in vivo by the methods of M.Jung et al., J.Neurochem., 28, 717 1977 . In human subjects, GABA T inhibition can be measured after systemic drug administration by determining elevated GABA levels and homocarnosine levels in cerebrospinal fluid CSF , since there is a known correlation between GABA levels in the brain andGABA levels and homocarnosine level in CSF. The compounds of Formula I do not inhibit GABA T in vitro. In order to produce inhibition of GABA T in vivo the compounds of Formula I must undergo biotrans formation to the corresponding fluoromethyl or difluoromethyl B alanine compounds which have the Formula A shown below EMI10.1 wherein p represents 1 or 2. The compound of Formula A are inhibitors of GABA T in vitro and in vivo and are described in UKApplication Nos. 7924030 and 8002553. The compounds of this invention can be administered in various manners to achieve the desired effect. The compounds can be administered alone or in the form of pharmaceutical preparations to the patient being treated either orally or parenterally, for example, subcutaneously, intravenously or interperitoneally. Unit doses of these compounds can contain, for example, from about 1 mg to 50 mg of the compound and may be administered, for example, from 1 to 4 times daily. As used herein the term patient is taken to mean warm blooded animals, such as, humans and other mammals, for example, cats, dogs, rats, mice, guinea pigs, sheep, horses and bovine cows, The term unit dosage form is used herein to mean a single or multiple dose form containing a quantity of the active ingredient in admixture with or otherwise in association with the diluent or carrier, said quantity being such that one or more predetermined units are normally required for a single therapeutic administration. In the case of multiple dose forms such as liquids or scored tablets, said predetermined unit will be one fraction, such as a 5 ml teaspoon quantity of a liquid or a half or quarter of a scored tablet, of the multiple dose form. In the composition aspect of the invention there are provided pharmaceutical formulations in which form the active compounds of the invention will normally be utilized. Such formulations are prepared in a manner well known per se in the pharmaceutical art and usually comprise at least one active compound of the invention in admixture or otherwise in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent therefor. For making these formulations the active ingredient will usually be mixed with a carrier, or diluted by a diluent, or enclosed or encapsulated in a capsule, sachet, cachet, paper or other container. A carrier or diluent may be solid, semi solid or liquid material which serves as a vehicle, excipient or medium for the active ingredient. Suitable carriers or diluents are well known per se. The formulations of the invention may be adapted for enteral or parenteral use and may be administered to the patient in the form of tablets, capsules, suppositories, solutions, suspensions or the like. In the specific examples included hereinbelow illustrative examples of suitable pharmaceutical formulations are described. Methods of preparing the compounds of Formula I will now be described. If in any of the reaction steps described an amino group of a reactant would be involved in an unwanted reaction under the relevant reactions conditions, the amino group will be protected in manner known per se by introduction of an appropriate protecting group. The protecting group will be chosen having regard to the nature of the relevant reaction and ease of removal to free the amino group. The protecting group can be selected from, for example, acyl, for example lower alkanoyl, e.g. acetyl, propionyl, trifluoroacetyl, and the like aroyl, e.g.benzoyl, toluoyl and the like lower alkoxycarbonyl, for example methoxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl,tertbutoxycarbonyl and the like carbobenzoxy, benzenesulfonyl and tosyl. Both amino hydrogen atoms can be substituted by a single protecting group such as, for example phthalyl. The protecting groups are introduced in manner known per se by, for example, reaction of the amine with a lower alkanoyl or aroyl chloride, anhydride, sulfonylchloride, tert butoxycarbonyl oxyimino 2 phenyl acetonitrile BOC ON , or ditertbutyl dicarbonate BOC 20 . Removal of the protecting group after the required reaction has been completed can be carried out in manner known per se for the relevant protecting group.Usually, said removal will be by hydrolytic cleavage using a strong organic or mineral acid such as, for example, trifluoroacetic acid, hydrochloric acid and the like acids by catalytic hydrogenation using Pd orPt catalyst or by hydrogen chloride gas. Solvents used will be chosen dependent upon the nature of the conditions of protecting group removal. For example, ethers such as, for example, diethylether can be used for cleavage using hydrogen chloride gas under anhydrous conditions. The compounds of Formula I in which R1, R2 andR3 are all hydrogen can be obtained in manner known per se from the corresponding compound of the following general Formula II.EMI13.1 wherein p represents 1 or 2. The amino acids of Formula II can be converted into the compound of Formula I by the Schmidt Reaction see, for example Organic Reactions Vol. III at page 308 in which it is treated with hydrazoic acid in the presence of a strong mineral acid such as, for example, sulfuric acid. The amino acids of Formula II also can be converted into the corresponding compound of Formula I in which R1, R2 and R3 are all hydrogen by theCurtius Reaction see, for example Organic ReactionsVol. III at page 338 after protecting the amino group with, for example, an alkylcarbonyl or alkoxycarbonyl group. In the Curtius Reaction, an acid is converted to an amine via the corresponding acyl azide and isocyanate. According to a Curtius Reaction procedure preferred for use in the present invention, the amino protected acid reactant is treated in an aprotic solvent with diphenylphosphoryl azide in the presence of a base such as pyridine and triethylamine and subsequently treated with excess C1 C4 alkanol seeYamada et al., Tet. Lett. 1973 , 2343 . The 4 amino group of the resultant intermediate can be freed by hydrolytic cleavage using a strong acid such as, for example, trifluoroacetic or hydrochloric acid. Preferably, the carbamate is heated in solution in a mixture of acetic acid and hydrochloric acid. If the treatment to free the 4 amino group does not remove the protecting moiety on the 2 amino group, said moiety can be removed by appropriate treatment before or after freeing the 4 amino group. Compounds of Formula I in which R1, R2 andR3 are all hydrogen also can be prepared by theHofmann Rearrangement see, for example OrganicReactions Vol. III at page 268 of the primary amide of the acid of Formula II in which the amino group is protected with, for example, phthalimido or trifluoroacetyl. In the Hofmann Rearrangement, a primary amide is converted to an amine via the corresponding N haloamide and isocyanate. According to a procedure preferred for use in the present invention, the amino protected amide reactant is treated with iodobenzene bis trifluoroacetate in acetonitrilewater see, for example, Radhakrishna et al, J. Org.Chem., 44 1979 1746 7 . The amide can be obtained from the acid of Formula II in conventional manner by, for example, forming the acid chloride and treating said chloride with ammonium acetate. The preparation of the acids of general Formula II is described in our U.K. Patent Specification No.2055264A. Coveniently, they also can be obtained by oxidation in manner known per se of the corresponding aminoalkene of the following general Formula III whilst protecting the amino group against oxidation EMI16.1 wherein E is 1 or 2. Preferably, the oxidation is carried out with potassium permanganate in aqueous acetic acid at room temperature overnight. The preparation of aminoalkenes of Formula III is described hereinafter. The compounds of Formula I in which R1, R2 and R3 all represent hydrogen also can be obtained in manner known per se from a diamine of the following general Formula IV Phthalimido CH2 CH2 EMI16.2 wherein p is 1 or 2, by converting the phthalimido group into a primary amino group whilst protecting the existing amino group.When p is 1, it is necessary to use a protecting group which does not leave any hydrogen atom on the amino group. Said conversion can be performed by hydrolytic cleavage using a strong mineral acid such as hydrobromic acid or hydrochloric acid or by reaction with hydrazine or methylamine. If necessary, the protecting group s can subsequently be removed in manner known per se. The diamines of Formula IV can be obtained in manner known per se from an aminoacid of the following general Formula V EMI17.1 wherein p represents 1 or 2, by conversion of the acid group into a primary amino group. The conversion of an aminoacid of Formula V into a diamine of Formula IV can be carried out by the SchimdtReaction, Curtius Reaction or Hofmann Rearrangement, all of which have been referred to above in connection with conversion of an aminoacid of Formula II into a compound of Formula I. The reaction conditions can be such that the phthalyl group is also removed to free the amino group whereby an intermediate of Formula IV is not isolated but the reaction product is the corresponding compound of Formula I in which R1, R2 and R3 are all hydrogen. In particular, the amide of the.compound of Formula V can be treated with a iodobenzene bis trifluoroacetate in acetonitrile water see, for example, Redhakrishna et al, J.Org.Chem. 44 1979 , 1746 7. The aminoacids of Formula V can be obtained by decarboxylation and hydrolysis in manner known per se of an aminodiester of the following general Formula VI EMI18.1 wherein E represents 1 or 2 and R5 and R6 independently represent C1 C4 alkyl groups, preferably both being tert. butyl. The conversion of an aminodiester of Formula VI into an aminoacid of Formula V can be performed by treatment with a strong acid such as, for example, hydrochloric, sulfuric acid, acetic, p toluenesulfonic or trifluoroacetic acid. The fluoromethylated aminodiesters of Formula VI can be obtained by mono or di fluoromethylation in manner known per se of an aminodiester of the followingFormula VII EMI18.2 wherein R5 and R6 are as defined in connection withFormula VI. The fluoromethylation can be carried out by adding an excess of a fluoromethylating agent of the following general Formula VIII to a solution in an aprotic solvent of a carbanion derived from the aminodiester ofFormula VII CF H W Formula VIII p 3 p wherein E represents 1 or 2 and W represents bromine, iodine or, preferably, chlorine. The carbanion usually is obtained by treating the aminodiester of Formula VII in the aprotic solvent with a base. The aminodiesters of Formula VII can be prepared by alkylation of a dialkyl malonate of the following general Formula IX with an alkylating agent of the following general Formula XEMI19.1 In Formula IX, R5 and R6 are as defined in connection with Formula VI and in Formula X, X1 is a leaving group, preferably chlorine, bromine, tosyloxy i.e. toluene p sulfonyloxy , or mesyloxy i.e.methanesulfonyloxy . The alkylation can be carried out in manner known per se in a protic or aprotic solvent using any strong base which will abstract a proton from the malonate of Formula IX. The diamines of Formula IV also can be prepared from a corresponding hydroxyamine of Formula XI by conversion in manner known per se of the hydroxy group into a phthalimido group EMI20.1 wherein p is 1 or 2. The diamines of Formula IV can be obtained by treating the hydroxyamine of Formula XI with phthalimide in the presence of a trialkyl or triarylphosphine and diethyl azodicarboxylate in an anhydrous aprotic solvent. The amino group of the compound of Formula XI preferably is protected by phthalyl, in which case both amino groups in the resultant diphthalimido product will be simultaneously freed, or by benzyl or benzhydryl i.e. diphenylmethyl , in which case the amino groups of the di protected amino product can be selectively freed. Said benzyl or benzhydryl group can be removed before or after the phthalyl group by catalytic hydrogenolysis in a protic solvent. When the amino groups can be selectively freed, one amino group can be freed and subsequently substituted as required before freeing and if required subsequently substituting the other amino group. Substitution of the amino groups is discussed in general terms hereinafter. The hydroxyamines of Formula XI can be obtained by reduction in manner known per se of a corresponding aminoacid or aminoester of the following generalFormula XII.EMI21.1 wherein p is 1 or 2 and R7 represents hydrogen, C1 Cg alkyl or benzyl. The amino group can be substituted by a protecting group, for example benzyl, which is not reduced under the reduction conditions used. The reduction usually will be carried out using a reducing agent known to reduce carboxylic acid esters to alcohols such as, for example, lithium aluminium hydride or diborane in an anhydrous aprotic organic solvent. The compounds of Formula XII can be obtained by reduction in manner known per se of a corresponding eneamine ester of the following general Formula XIII EMI21.2 wherein E is 1 or 2 R8 represents C1 Cg alkyl or benzyl, and, when an acid of Formula XII is required i.e.R7 is hydrogen , subsequent hydrolysis of the resultant ester of Formula XII i.e. R7 is Rg . The amino group can be substituted by a protecting group, for example benzyl, which is not reduced under the reduction conditions used. The reduction can be carried out at acidic pH in a protic solvent using a borohydride salt such as sodium cyano hydrido borate. Said substituted eneamine esters can be prepared in manner known per se from the corresponding fluorinated aceto acetate of the following generalFormula XIV EMI22.1 wherein 2 and R8 are as defined in connection withFormula XIII. The fluorinated aceto acetates can be converted into the eneamine ester by treatment with the corresponding amine in an aprotic solvent in the presence of a catalytic amount of a strong acid. The eneamine esters also can be obtained by treatment of the corresponding fluorinated aceto acetate of Formula XIV with an excess of ammonium acetate in anhydrous methanol. The fluorinated aceto acetates of Formula XIV are either known or can be prepared by analogous methods to those reported for the preparation of the known fluorinated aceto acetates see, for example, Bergman et al, J. Chem. Soc. 1959 , 3278 McBee et al, J.Amer. Chem. Soc. 75 1953 3152 and Inman et al, J.Amer. Chem. Soc. 80 1958 6533 .

The compounds of Formula I in which R3 is hydrogen and R1 and R2 independently represent hydrogen, C1 C6 alkyl or phenyl C1 C4 alkyl but at least one of them is other than hydrogen can be obtained by reducing in manner known per se the corresponding aminoamide of the following generalFormula XXV EMI27.1 wherein E represents 1 or 2 and R1 and R2 are as defined above2 and The compound of Formula XXV can be used in the form of a derivative in which the amino group is substituted by one or more protecting groups which are not reduced under the reduction conditions used and said protecting group s subsequently removed. The reduction can be carried out in an aprotic solvent using a reducing agent such as, for example, a boron hydride, e.g. diborane, an alkyl or alkoxy aluminium hydride, e.g. diisobutyl aluminium hydride, or lithium aluminium hydride. The aminoamides of Formula XXV can be obtained in manner known per se from the corresponding aminoacids of the following general Formula XXVI EMI28.1 wherein p represents 1 or 2 or the corresponding amino protected derivatives thereof. The aminoacids of Formula XXVI can be treated with the required amine i.e. HNR1R2 in an aprotic solvent in the presence of a coupling reagent such as, for example, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or N ethoxy carbonyl 2 ethoxy 1 ,2 dihydroquinoline. The aminoacids of Formula XXVI are aminoacids ofFormula XII in which R7 represents hydrogen. The amides of Formula I can be prepared directly or indirectly in manner known per se from the corresponding diamines of Formula I. In some, circumstances, it may be necessary to protect the non reacting amino group prior to the reaction. If the amide is to be formed at the 2 position i.e. R3 is to be other than hydrogen the amino group at the 4 position i.e. R1 and R2 are both hydrogen can be protected by a phthalimido derivative, for example formed by reaction in manner known per se with a C2 Cs carbalkoxy phthalimide, e.g.carbethoxy phthalimide. When required, the phthalyl protecting group can be removed by, for example, treatment with hydrazine or methylamine. If so desired, the phthalimido derivative can be obtained directly from a compound of Formula IV in which the primary amino group is substituted by benzyl or benzhydryl by catalytic hydrogenolysis in a protic solvent to remove the benzyl or benzhydryl group and thereby free the 2 amino group. Said catalytic hydrogenolysis has been discussed above in connection with conversion of a diamine of Formula IV to the corresponding diamine of Formula I. If the amide is to be formed at the 4 position, the primary amino group at the 2 position can be protected by, for example, a benzoxycarbonyl group group which can be introduced by reaction in manner known per se with a benzyl haloformate, e.g. benzyl chloroformate. When required, the benzoxy group can be removed by acid hydrolysis, for example by treatment with hydrogen bromide in dioxane. The amides can be obtained by N acylating the corresponding compound having a primary amino group by treatment with an acid halide of the formula RgCO halogen wherein Rg represents C1 C4 alkyl, phenyl or phenyl C1 C4 alkyl, in water in the presence of a base. In the case where the said amide has an aminocarboxylic acid residue, the amide can be prepared byN acylation of the corresponding compound having a primary amino group with the corresponding aminocarboxylic acid or an anhydride thereof, in which acid or anhydride the amino group is protected with a suitable blocking agent such as benzoxycarbonyl or tert butoxycarbonyl, in an anhydrous organic solvent and, when the free acid is employed, in the presence of a dehydrating agent2 followed by acid or base hydrolysis. The individual optical isomers of the compounds ofFormula I wherein R2 and R3 are hydrogen may be separated in manner known per se by protecting the amino group distal to the fluorinated methyl group using a C2 C5 alkoxycarbonyl phthalimide in a solvent such as, for example, tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether or C1 C4 alkanol, e.g. as methanol or ethanol. The protected amine derivative is then resolved using a chiral acid such as or binaphthylphosphoric acid by the method described by R. Viterbo et al., in Tetrahedron Letters 48, 4617 4620 1971 and in U.S. Patent 3, 848,030 or camphor 10 sulfonic acid. The resolved phthalimido compound is then deprotected using, for example, hydrazine or methylamine to remove the phthalimide group. The thus resolved amines may be employed to prepare the individual isomers of other compounds of the invention in the manner described hereinabove. It is preferred however that optical resolution should be effected at the intermediate aminoacid ofFormula II or Formula XII by resolving the acid or an ester thereof with a chiral acid such as binaphthyl phosphoric acid or camphor sulfonic acid as discussed above. Alternatively, the aminoacid can be resolved by forming an amide with a chiral acid such as alpha phenylpropionic acid, separating the diasteriomers and hydrolysing the separated amides to the acids. The compounds produced by the foregoing processes may be isolated either per se or as acid addition salts thereof. The acid addition salts are preferably the pharmaceutically acceptable, non toxic addition salts with suitable acids, such as those previously referred to in this Specification. Apart from pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts, other acid addition salts, such as for example, those with picric or oxalic acid are useful they may serve as intermediates in the purification of the compounds of the invention or in the preparation of other, for example, pharmaceutically acceptable, acid addition salts, or are useful for identification or characterisation of the bases. A resulting acid addition salt may be converted into the free compound according to known methods, for example, by treating it with an alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide or alkoxide, with an alkali or an alkaline earth metal carbonate or hydrogen carbonate, with trialkylamine or with an anion exchange resin. A resulting acid addition salt may also be converted into another acid addition salt according to known methods for example, a salt with an inorganic acid may be treated with a metal salt, for example a sodium, barium or silver salt of an acid in a suitable diluent, in which a resulting inorganic salt is insoluble and is thus removed from the reaction medium.An acid addition salt may also be converted into another acid addition salt by treatment with an anion exchange preparation. The invention is illustrated by the following non limiting Examples. All NMR measurements are given on the delta scale i.e. trimethylsilane 0 .

EXAMPLE 10 The ability of the compounds of Formula I to inhibit GABA T enzyme and to increase GABA concentra tion in the brain can be demonstrated in the following test procedures in mice. A group of 10 male albino CDI mice from Charles Riner, France, is given an i.p. injection of the test compound in aqueous solution daily for four consecutive days. Half of the animals are killed by decapitation 24 hours after the last dose of the test compound. The other half of the animals are observed for up to 12 days for toxicity as indicated by weight loss and deaths . Control animals receive an injection of the vehicle only. The brains are removed from the dead mice and are divided into two portions by sagittal sect ion. One half is used for the measurement of GABA T activity while the other half is used for measuring GABA content. TheGABA T activity is measured using known methods as described by M.Jung et al., J. Neurochem., 28, 717 1977 and 29, 797 1977 . GABA content is measured by per hloric acid or trichloroacetic acid extracts using an amino acid analyzer equiped with a fluorescene detector.
