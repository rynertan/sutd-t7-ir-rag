# Ethylene polymers stabilized against water treeing by N phenyl substituted amino silanes, and the use of these compositions as insulation about electrical conductors.

## Abstract
Compositions, devoid of fillers. comprising an ethylene polymer and an N phenyl substituted amino silane, which can be extruded about electrical conductors to provide insulation thereon which is resistant to the formation of water trees.
