# Voltage comparator circuit.

## Abstract
A voltage comparator which is hardly affected by noise and is operable with a low power consumption is disclosed. The comparator circuit comprises first and second flip flop circuits coupled in series between different voltage termin als. The first flip flop circuit operates in response to a pair of differential voltages and a state of the second flip flop is determined by the first flip flop circuit.
