# Optical system for an optical memory.

## Abstract
An optical system for use with an optical memory 48 including an optical arrangement 56 for separating light reflected from the surface of the optical memory 48 into a plurality of different resultant beams. This optical mechan ism 56 comprising four reflecting surfaces 56A, 56B 1, 56B 2, 56B 3 each of which are inclined at a different angle relative the optical memory 48 to direct the resultant beams of light each in a different direction nor normal or parallel to each other. Preferably, at least three of these reflective surface 56B 1, 56B 2, 56B 3 are contiguous to one another. The optical system further includes a photodetector 64 having a plurality of photosensitive regions aligned to receive the resultant beams from the aforementioned reflec tive surfaces 56A, 56B 1, 56B 2, 56B 3 .
