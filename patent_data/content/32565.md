# Mounting and packaging of silicon devices on ceramic substrates, and packaged silicon devices.

## Abstract
Mounting silicon devices on a ceramic substrate creates considerable problems when the device has a ge ometry, such as being very long relative to its width, due to flatness and thermal mismatches. In the present inven tion a thin silicon substrate 20 is interposed between base 35 and device 10, the substrate 20 of a geometry which reduces flatness and thermal mismatching to acceptable levels. Also the use of a silicon substrate 20 enables well developed and easily provided silicon technology to form conductor patterns 22, 23 for interconnecting between device 10 and base 35, avoiding problems of producing such conductor patterns on the ceramic base. The inven tion is particularly useful for the mounting of linear devices 10, such as linear imagers, which can have a length to width ratio in excess of 10 1. Active, and passive, circuit members 60 can be built into and onto the substrate.
