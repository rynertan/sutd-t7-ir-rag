## Description
STABLE ERYTHROMYCIN SOLUTION AND PROCESS THEREFOR Erythromycin has a limited stability in aqueous solution according to Chemical Abstracts, 60, 14337 1964 . U.S. Patent 4,000,263 discloses a stable erythromycin solution containing propylene glycol, ethyl alcohol and an ethoxylated ether of bury alcohol Brij 30 . The amount of propylene glycol varies from 35 to 45 percent. According to U.S. Patent 4,000,263 the erythromycin solutions disclosed therein lose about 5 of their stability in 10 weeks at 450C. or in 18 weeks at 370C. Mills, writing in Cutis, 15, 93 1975 , described the use of a 2 percent solution of erythromycin in a 1 1 ethanol water solvent for treatment of acne. J.E. Fulton Jr., Dermat, 110, 83 1974 , used a I percent solution of erythromycin in a solvent containing two parts of ethanol, 2 parts ethylene glycol monomethyl ether and I part of propylene glycol. The author reported this preparation is quite effective for the treatment of acne. Antibiotics, including members of the lincomycin family, tetracycline and epi tetracycline, have been used to treat acne see U.S. Patent Nos. 3,969,516 and 3,952,099. The latter patent is more concerned with increased penetration of the antibiotic through the skin by the addition of decylmethylsulfoxide to an alcoholic solution of the antibiotic. The invention provides a pharmaceutical formulation comprising per ml. from I to 100 mg. of the active ingredient erythromycin and the excip ents ethanol, sufficient non toxic acid to give a pH in the range of 8 10 after dilution with water, and propylene glycol not exceeding 0.3 ml. but sufficient to bring the volume to I ml. The invention also provides a process for the preparation of a pharmaceutical formulation having as active ingredient erythromycin comprising dissolving I to 100 mg. per ml. final volume erythromycin in ethanol, adding sufficient non toxic acid to give a pH in the range of 810 after dilution with water and adding propylene glycol in an amount of up to 30 of the final volume of the preparation. It is preferred for the ethanol to be present in an amount corresponding to 70 of the final volume of the preparation. The preferred concentration of erythromycin in the solution is 20 mg. per ml. In the preparation of the solution sufficient acid is added to give a final pH in the range 8 10 upon dissolving the preparation in sufficient water to enable a pH reading to be taken. The pH is suitably determined on a pHi meter with a glass electrode. Any pharmaceutically acceptable non toxic acid may be used but the preferred acid is citric acid, and it has been found that a final concentration of 0.04 of citric acid 0.4 mg ml gives a solution which upon dilution in water yields of pH of about 9 with a glass electrode. A double blind study was carried out in humans suffering from acne in which the vehicle itself lacking the erythromycin was used as a control. Those patients receiving a formulation made in accordance with this invention showed a 56 decrease in the number of papules over the test period whereas in the control group which received the formulation vehicle alone there was only a 31 decrease in papules. The number of patients used were sufficient wo render this difference statistically significant. The solutions of this invention are quite stable. For example, a solution containing 22 mg of erythromycin. I0 excess , รป.7 ml of ethanol USP, sufficient citric acid to give a final concentration of 0.04 and propylene glycol q.s to I ml.was shown to assay 83.2 of initial 2.9 of label claim antibiotic present at 250C. after thirty months storage. Other solutions confirm this trend in stability. In preparing the erythromycin solution of this invention, it is customary to dissolve the erythromycin base and acid, e.g. organic acid, preferably citric acid, in ethanol and then add sufficient propylene glycol to make up the final solution to I ml. or a multiple thereof. The ingredients are then thoroughly mixed. Whilst the propylene glycol can be present in an amount of up to 30 of the total volume of formulation 0.3 ml per ml , it is preferably present in an amount which itself is at least sufficient to dissolve the erythromycin contained in the formulation so that the erythromycin is kept in solution and available for absorption into the skin upon any evaporation of the ethanol. Amounts of above 30 propyiene glycol tend to cause skin irritation. The ethanol is likewise preferably present in an amount at least sufficient to dissolve the erythromycin contained in the formulation.
