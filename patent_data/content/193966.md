# A method of placing an elongate member of generally cylindrical form in a predetermined position.

## Abstract
An end portion of an elongate member of generally cy lindrical form, such as an optical fiber, is placed in a prede termined position utilizing a substrate having a surface that is defined by a generatrix that is a straight line, e.g. a flat surface. A foil of flexible material is secured to the surface of the substrate and defines with the substrate a generally straight, elongate passageway that is parallel to the genera trix of the surface and has a first portion of substantially uni form cross section adapted to receive an end of the elon gate member in closely fitting relationship and also has a second portion that tapers towards the first portion. The end portion of the elongate member is inserted into the first por tion of the passageway by way of the second portion thereof.
