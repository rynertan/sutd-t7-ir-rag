# Detergent composition with a suds regulating system.

## Abstract
Detergent compositions having regulated suds over a broad range of usage and laundry temperature conditions containing an organic surface active agent and a mixture of suds regulating components are disclosed. The suds regulating agent is a mixture of a liquid hydrocarbon in conjunction with an adjunct material, which can be a solid hydrocarbon or a fatty ester, and a hydrophobic silica suds regulating agent. The subject compositions are capable of providing effective and uniform suds regulating activity over the complete range of laundry temperatures from ambient temperature up to the boil and are generally independent of soil load, water hardness and other incidental factors known to interfere with the suds regulating activity.
