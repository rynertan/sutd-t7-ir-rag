# CAPACITOR STRUCTURE WITH DUAL DIELECTRICS

## Abstract
A capacitor structure for semiconductor devices 1, 2 , utilizing a dual or duplex dielectric wherein one dielectric layer 3 is comprised of silicon nitride or aluminum oxide and a second dielectric layer 4 is formed of Ta₂O₅, HfO₂, TiO₂, PbTiO₃, BaTiO₃, CaTiO₃ or SrTiO₃. One electrode 2 is preferably selected from conductive polycrystalline silicon, Ta, and Hf. The other electrode 5 is preferably selected from Al or Au based metals.
