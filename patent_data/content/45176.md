# An elastomeric strip and method of manufacturing same.

## Abstract
An elastomeric strip has a support frame having selected regions of longitudinally displaceable frame portions such as wire loops reinforced by degraded and non degraded materi als that are non degradable during the frame coating operation for inhibiting longitudinal displacement of the frame portions during the frame coating operation. The degraded material breaks down when the strip is flexed to allow increased flexibil ity of the strip, and the non degraded material prevents undue elongation or stretching of the strip. A method of manufactur ing the strip comprises reinforcing regions of the frame por tions with degradable materials, arranging the reinforced sup port frame in position to be coated, coating the reinforced sup port frame with an elastomeric material, and then degrading selective regions of the degradable reinforcing materials.
