# Split yoke universal joint.

## Abstract
A high torque universal joint has a cross 10 formed by two mutually perpendicular pairs of coaxial trunnions 11 , each pair of trunnions being rotatably received in bearings 26 which in turn are coaxially retained in blind bores 24 in the bearing caps 22 of one of two yokes 12, 12 . The yokes are subdivided into mating half sections 12a, 12b which each in clude one of the bearing caps. The mating half sections are separably interconnected 48, 50 and are provided with juxta posed confronting surfaces 38 lying on opposite sides of first yoke reference planes extending through the universal joint center X . The mating half sections have end surfaces 52 which are adapted to abut the flanged ends 18 of rotatable elements 20 at second yoke reference planes. The first and second reference planes of each yoke are mutually perpendi cular, and first and second key members 44, 54 are located respectively at the first and second reference planes. The res training forces acting at the first and second yoke reference planes coact during service of the joint to prevent relative movement between the mating yoke half sections.
