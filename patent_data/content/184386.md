# Earth moving machine with counterweight.

## Abstract
A machine comprises a body 10 having a ground engaging propulsion means 11 and a base frame 14 mounted on the ground engaging means 11 , the base frame 14 being movable relative to the ground engaging propulsion means 11 about a first generally vertical axis V , a boom 30 extending outwardly of the body 10 and mounted on the base frame 14 for movement about a second axis B transverse relative to the first axis V , the boom 30 having mounted at an outer end 36 thereof for movement about a third axis 71 also transverse to the first vertical axis V , a dipper arm 37 , an implement 43 mounted at an outer end 42 of the dipper arm 37 for movement about a fourth axis T2 , also generally transverse relative to the vertical axis 41 , a cable 47 secured to the dipper arm 37 and connected to a winch means 50 to effect movement of the dipper arm 37 relative to the boom 30 to effect movement of the implement 43 towards the body 10 , a hydraulic ram 38 mounted between the dipper arm 37 and the boom 30 to effect movement of the dipper arm 37 relative to the boom 30 and hence to effect movement of the implement 43 at least away from the body 10 , and a counterweight 20a, mounted on the base frame 14 , means being provided to move the counterweight 20a, towards and away from the first vertical axis 41 in response to movement of the centre of gravity of the machine 10 .
