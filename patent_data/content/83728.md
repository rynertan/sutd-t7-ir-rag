# Low loss wide band front end for NMR receiver.

## Abstract
An inductive element of a multipole impedance trans forming bandpass network of classical design such as Butterworth or Chebyshev, for example, is employed as a pick up coil for sensing NMR signals. The network matches the high input impedance of an NMR receiver preamplifier to the low impedance of the pick up coil. Simultaneously, and as a consequence of the impedance matching, the high preamplifier input impedance appears as a band width broadening element at the pick up coil. By virtue of the multipole design of transformer, a bandwidth broader than the natural bandwidth of the pick up coil is obtained and the transfer of the energy of the detected NMR signal to the preamplifier is maximized.
