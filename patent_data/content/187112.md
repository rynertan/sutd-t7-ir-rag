# Solenoid valve, particularly as bypass valve with fuel injector.

## Abstract
A normally open, solenoid controlled valve 34 rapidly controls the flow of liquid between a high pressure supply and a relatively lower pressure drain. The valve includes a stationary valve seat spindle 37 and a cylindrical valve sleeve 140 encircling and slidable along part of the valve seat spindle 37 . The valve seat spindle 37 is provided with an annular control edge 80 and the valve sleeve 140 includes a frustoconical pressure responsive contact sur face 82 which is moved into and out of valve closing contact with the control edge 80 by means of axial reciprocation of the valve sleeve 140 between valve closed and valve open positions. The valve seat spindle 37 includes a flow pas age 36, 36 therein which is in continuous fluid commun ication with a high pressure fluid inlet 30 in a valve hous ing and which extends to and discharges into a plenum re gion 81 formed between the spindle 37 and the sleeve 140 adjacent to the control edge 80 and relatively toward that part of the seat spindle 37 along which the valve sleeve 140 slides. When energization of the solenoid 44 is discon tinued, the high pressure liquid in the plenum 81 acts axi ally on the valve sleeve 140 , and particularly the pressure responsive contact surface 82 , to rapidly open the valve 34 . The response rate and simplicity of the valve 34 are enhanced by the absence of a biasing spring. The valve 34 is suited for use as a bypass valve in integral combination with a high pressure fuel injector nozzle of the pressure responsive type.
