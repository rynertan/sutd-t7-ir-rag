# Noise detector.

## Abstract
Noise detector for detecting noise pulses in a non limited incoming radio signal modulated on a carrier, comprising an amplitude detection circuit 20 and coupled thereto a first signal comparison arrangement 23 having a signal input 22 and a threshold input 25 , a first threshold signal depending on the average input level of the noise detector and a second threshold signal depending on the noise pulse repetition frequency being applied to this threshold input 25 . To limit the repetition frequency of the detection output signals of the noise detector without reducing the input sensitivity, the threshold level of the noise detector is controlled in forward direction in dependence on the field strength and the noise pulse repetition frequency. To that end the amplitude detection circuit 20 is connected on the one hand via a signal input to an input 15 of the noise detector and on the other hand via an envelope output 21 to the signal input 22 of the first signal comparison arrangement 23 and also to a signal input of a second signal comparison arrangement 30 , this envelope output 21 also being coupled to a first low pass filter 24 for forming the first threshold signal, which first threshold signal is applied to the threshold input 25 of the first arrangement 23 and a threshold input of the second arrangement 30 , this second arrangement 30 being coupled via a second low pass filter 31 for forming the second threshold signal to the threshold input 25 of the first arrangement 23 .
