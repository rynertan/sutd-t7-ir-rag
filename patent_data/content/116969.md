# Precipitation hardenable copper alloy, process for treating such alloy and use of such alloy.

## Abstract
An improved copper base alloy for use in electrical springs and a process of treating the alloy provide improved resistance to stress relaxation when the alloy is in a solution treated and aged condition having a discontinuous precipi tate. The alloy consists essentially of from about 10 to about 15 nickel, from about 1 to about 3 aluminum, up to about 1 manganese, from about 0.05 to less than about 0.5 magnesium and the balance copper. The alloy is readily hot workable if held within a critical temperature range of from about 880 C to about 980 C prior to hot working.
