## Description
DESCRIPTION A DISPLAY AND STORAGE CABINET FOR ARTICLES DISPLAYED IN SUSPENDED PACKSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a cabinent for displaying and storing articles presented in suspended packs and relates particularly to such a cabinet for storing a very large number of products with a view to displaying them and selling them. It allows a very large number of packed bulky articles to be stored and displayed, requiring a reduced space, the display being however attractive for the possible purchaser and allowing articles to be readily moved and replaced, and with every safety contrary to the display of articles suspended on a projecting metal rod. The cabinet of the invention is particularly suitable to displaying and storing several types of suspended packs. A particular but not exclusive application is the storage and display in the shop of packs containing confectionery more particularly of a type having a picture in relief on one face which is attractive for children, the confectionery being packed under the relief picture. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the invention, a compact display storage cabinet is provided for a large number of articles presented in packs suspended from a slit of eyelet, formed by a rectangular parallelepipedic case with three side walls, the fourth face which forms the front face being open and by an array of vertically suspended parallel strips, this array comprising several rows of strips disposed side by side and each formed from several strips placed one behind the other, each strip supporting several hooks or fasteners each adapted to receive the eyelet or slit of an article and disposed one under the other. Advantageously, each row of strips is suspended from a horizontal rod passing through an aperture made accessible by a slit formed at the upper part of the strip, different rods, parallel to each other, being fixed at the upper part of the case. In a particular embodiment, the cabinet may comprise at the lower part one or more drawers in which additional articles may be placed identical or not to those which are hooked onto the vertical strips.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The invention will in any case be well understood from the complement of description which follows and the accompanying drawings, which complement and drawings are of course given especially by way of indication. Figure 1 shows in perspective with the parts cut away a display and storage cabinet in accordance with the invention in an embodiment comprising drawers in the lowerpart a certain number of packed articles are shown hooked onto the suspended vertical strips, others being disposed in the drawers. Figure 2 is an enlarged view of one of the strips of Figure 1 with some articles. Figure 3 is an end view corresponding toFigure 2. Figure 4 shows a pack intended to be displayed and stored in the cabinet of Figure 1. Figure 5 illustrates, in a top view, the upper part of the cabinet of Figure 1, the cover thereof having being removed, this Figure 5 showing a series of horizontal rods each supporting a row of parallel strips. Figure 6, finally, shows in perspective the suspension of the strips on the horizontal rods.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION According to the invention and more especially according to one of its modes of application, as well as those of the embodiments of its different parts, to which it seems preference should be given, wishing for example to construct a display and storage cabinet for bags or other suspended packed articles, the following or similar is the way to set about it. A case Figures 1 and 5 is first of all required comprising three parallel walls, 2, the front face 3 being open. The case comprises an upper cover or roof 4, removed in Figure 5, and a lower cover or bottom 5. It may further comprise several drawers 6.According to the essential feature of the invention, an array of vertical strips 7 are disposed in case 1 and grouped together in several rows 8a, 8b, 8c, 8d, 8e disposed side by side perpendicularly to the front face 3, each row comprising several strips 7 disposed one behind the other. Each strip 7 supports Figures 1, 2 and 3 a series of hooks or fasteners 9, obtained by partial perforation, in which the eyelet 10 of a packed article 11 may be slipped. The spacing A between fasteners 9 disposed along each strip 7 is generally slightly greater than the height B of the packed articles 11. Articles 11 may for example be formed by heatformed packs of confectionery comprising a flat bottom 12 and a bulging front face 13 distant from bottom 12 and having a picture animal, human head, etc , as can be seen in Figures 2 to 4 the confectionery is housed between the bulging front face 13 and bottom 12. It will be readily understood that a very large number of packed articles 11 may be readily stored on fasteners 9 of strips 7, the articles on the strips disposed in front of each row 8a, 8b, 8c, 8d, 8e being visible at the beginning then, as articles are removed from the first strip of a row, the article located behind becomes visible in its turn and so on. It is easy to remove an article 11 from its fastener 9 and to fix a new article to a free fastener In order to provide a particularly attractive appearance, it may be provided for each row 8a to 8e to carry an article slightly different from that of the other rows, for example from the picture and or color point of view. Advantageously, the strips 7 are freely suspended in the display and storage cabinet. A series of rods 14 may for example be provided Figures 5 and 6 , in number equal to that of the rows 5 in the embodiment shown , fixed horizontally and parallel to each other, at trne upper part of the cabinet, each strip 7 being supported by one its rods. To this end, a slit 15 may be provided, ending in a rounded hole 15a, for fitting a strip 7 onto rod 14. As can be seen in Figure 1, articles may also be disposed in the drawers 6, these articles being for example then fixed to strip 7 as the articles which were previously hooked onto these strips are sold. Conversely, after taking down an article, a consumer may, if required, leave it in one of the drawers 6. Strips 7 may be made from corrugated cardboard or a plastic material, for example of the AKILUX type the same goes for case 1 and drawers 6, rods 14 being preferably made from metal. As is evident and as it follows moreover already from what has gone before, the invention is in no wise limited to those of its modes of application and embodiments which have been more especially considered it embraces, on the contrary, all variants thereof.
