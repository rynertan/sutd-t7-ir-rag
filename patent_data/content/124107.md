# Fluid jet apparatus and method for cleaning tubular components.

## Abstract
Fluid jet apparatus and method for cleaning material from the inside of a tubular conduit utilizing a cleaning head that lies adjacent to one wall of the conduit and includes at least two fluid jet forming means for directing a plurality of high pressure fluid cutting jets in a forward direction and at an acute angle relative to the axis of the head and the conduit so that they are directed toward the opposite wall of the conduit. The cleaning head is rotated around and remains adjacent to the wall of the conduit and is advanced into the conduit as the jets cut away the material whereby the fluid jets create an asymmetric cut ting pattern on the surface of the material and the counter thrust of the fluid jets keeps the cleaning head offset relative to the axis of the conduit and against the wall of the conduit to provide passage for removal of the cut material and spent fluid away from the cutting area and out the end of conduit.
