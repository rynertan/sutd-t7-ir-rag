# Method for forming a toner imager in electrophotographic printing.

## Abstract
A layer of charged toner particles 26 is formed on a photoconductive layer 23 having trap potential levels by a first developer 25 to which a voltage of the same polarity as that of the toner particles is applied to cause the toner particles to adhere to the surface of the photoconductive layer. Subsequently, an optical beam L is projected thereon corresponding to an image to be printed, making the expo sed portion conductive to trap charges 27 of opposite pola rity just beneath the surface of the photoconductive layer 23 . The trapped charges are fixed by cutting off the optical beam, and a latent image is thus formed, which is reprodu ced in a second developing step wherein a reversed voltage is applied to the toner particle layer through a second develo per 28 allowing the toner particles 30 on the exposed por tion of the photoconductive layer to adhere thereto, and re moving the toner particles on the non exposed portion the reof. The formation of the layer of charged toner particles 26 and the exposure to the light beam L can be performed sequentially or simultaneously.
