# Composition containing S sulfonated immunoglobulin and aggregation preventing or aggregate dissociating agent therefor, and processes for preparing compositions containing high proportions of monomeric S sulfonated immunoglobulin.

## Abstract
Known compositions comprising an immunoglobulin suffer the problem that the presence of aggregated molecules of immunoglobulin can cause anaphylactic side effects. S sulfonation of an immunoglobulin provides a safer product having fewer side effects but aggregated molecules are still present. The invention provides a composition having a reduced concentration of aggregated molecules comprising an S sulfonated immunoglobulin and, as an aggregation pre venting or aggregate dissociating agent therefor, 1 to 600 by weight, based on the weight of the S sulfonated immuno globulin, of a water soluble acid addition salt of a basic nitrogen containing organic compound containing one or more basic nitrogen atoms in the molecule and having a pKb at 25 C of not more than 7. The composition can be used for the intravenous administration of an immunoglobulin or can be lyophilized. Compositions containing a high proportion of mono meric S sulfonated immunoglobulin can be prepared by con tacting an S sulfonated immunoglobulin in aqueous solution with 1 to 600 by weight, based on the weight of the S sulfonated immunoglobulin, of the water soluble acid add ton salt, or by reacting immunoglobulin in aqueous solu tion with a compound capable of yielding a sulfite ion in water and an oxidizing agent in the presence of 1 to 600 by weight, based on the immunoglobulin, of the water soluble acid addi tion salt.
