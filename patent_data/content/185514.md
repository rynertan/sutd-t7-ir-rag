# Waste heat recovery apparatus.

## Abstract
A waste heat recovery apparatus is disclosed which recovers the waste heat of high temperature exhaust gas discharged from a furnace 1 . The apparatus includes a radiation body 9 made of ceramic material, which is formed with a ehat radiation surface arranged in the vicinity of, and toward the inside of the furnace 1 . The radiation body 9 has a plurality of regular channels 8 allowing passage of the exhause gas therethrough. Exhaust gas passed through the channels 8 heats the radiation body 9 , and substantial amount of the holding heat of the exhaust gas is radiated from the radiation surface toward the inside of the furnace 1 , allowing an efficient waste heat recovery.
