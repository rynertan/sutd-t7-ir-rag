# MONITORING OF MAGNETICALLY PERMEABLE PARTICLES IN A CARRIER MATERIAL

## Abstract
Monitoring the quantity of magnetically permeable parti cles dispersed within a carrier of a composite material by ener gizing an inductor coil 28 which surrounds the material and then producing a signal corresponding to inductance of the coil. The inductance is influenced by the quantity of permeable particles in the carrier and within the coil and hence the signal is a measure of this quantity and is usable in a method of con trolling the particles. In this control, the signal is evaluated and if it differs from that representing a desired quantity of parti cles, a control means is operated to adjust input of particles or carrier into the composite material. The composite material may be in fluid state and is passed through the coil and within a dielectric vessel 30, 58 . Alternatively, the material is a dry dielectric layer provided upon a conductor 14 which is passed through the coil.
