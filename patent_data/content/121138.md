## Description
PLAIDS, METHODS FOR CONTRUCTION OF THE SAME, MICRO ORGANISMS CARRYING THE PLASMIDS AND METHODS FOR CULTI VATION OF THE MICROORGANISMS Background of the Invention 1 Field of the Invention This invention relates to novel plasmids, methods for construction of the plasmids, novel microorganisms carrying the plasmids, and methods for cultivation of the microorganisms and relates more particularly to novel plasmids with DNA coding for extracellular production of such high molecular substances as penicillinase and xylanase, novel microorganisms transformed with the plasmids, and methods for extracellular production of such high molecular substances as penicillinase and xylanase by cultivating the microorganisms. 2 Description of the Prior Art Plasmids are nan chrarsanal elenurrtsof cyclic DNA found in a microorganism cell. Plasmids are currently being used as a means for recombination of microorganism genes and are becoming more and more important in the field of fermentation industry. Studies have recently been done on plasmids carrying foreign DNA having genetic information of metabolic products of specific demand for growth of microorganism, as shown in production of amino acids or peptides. Some plasmids have been introduced into host microorganisms to obtain transformants.Methods have been proposed for producing relatively low molecular compounds such as amino acids and peptides by cultivating the transformants. However, the degree of propagation of plasmids carrying genes for production of highmolecular substances depends on the nature of host microorganisms and those plasmids have not effectively been expressed. Furthermore, no effective methods for cultivation of such transformants have been established. It has not been possible to selectively obtain a certain extracellular high molecular product by cultivating a microorganism transformed with a plasmid carrying foreign DNA fragment having genetic information of extracellular production of high molecular substances which are metabolic products of other microorganisms. Such extracellular production has not successfully been done even when a transformant of Escherichia species, which is usually used as a host microorganism, is used. US A 4,411,994 of W.Gilbert et al discloses a process for producing specific proteins in bacteria and having them excreted from the bacterial cell. This process comprises inserting theDNA coding for the desired non bacterial protein or part of a protein by recombinant techniques into a plasmid or phage gene which codes for either a periplasmic or an extracellular protein, hereinafter called a carrier protein ,then transfoneno a bacterial host with the recombinant DNA and culturing the transformed host to excrete the protein. The process of this patent provides a means for producing a selected protein by employing a gene for a carrier protein which has a leader sequence of hydrophobic amino acids at its amino terminus. Cell wall of Escherichia coli which has often been used for production of useful physiologically active substances, consists of three kinds of membrane inner membrane, peptide glycan and outer membrane. The space between the inner and outer membrane is called the periplasmic space. The process of US A 4,411,994 has succeeded in the excretion of the products into the periplasmic space but not into the culture medium through the outer membrane or outside the bacterial host cell. In the present invention, by inserting the DNA having genetic information of extracellular production of high molecular substances into the plasmid to obtain a hybrid plasmid and culturing the host transformed with the hybrid plasmid, it is possible to excrete useful physiologically active substances through the outer membrane and recover them directly from the culture medium. Thus, the present invention makes mass production of useful physiologically active substances possible, which has never been possible by the prior art processes. Summary of the Invention Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide novel plasmids with DNA carrying geneticinformation of extracellular production of high molecular compounds, methods for construction of the plasmids, novel microorganisms carrying the plasmids and methods for cultivation of the microorganisms. Novel plasmids according to the present invention are the capability of those which provide a host withjextracellular production of high molecular substances such as penicillinase and xylanase. The novel plasmids are constucted from a vector plasmid and a DNA fragment having genetic information of extracellular production of high molecular substances such as penicillinase and xylanase. Those DNA fragments are obtained from microorganisms of the genus Bacillus. Extraceliular production means that the high molecular substances produced are excreted from the cells into the culture medium. These plasmids can be prepared by a process which comprises preparing, with a restriction enzyme, a chromosomalDNA fragment coding for extracellular production of penicillinase, xylanase or the like, digesting a plasmid vectorDNA with a restriction enzyme which does not interfere with the genetic information carried on the chromosomal DNA fragment, treating the chromosonal DNA fragment and the digested vector plasmid with DNA . ligase to form a recombinant plasmid and isolating the recombinant plasmid. Novel microorganisms according to the present invention are those which belong to the genus Escherichia which contain the recombinant plasmid and which have the capability of extracellulai production of high molecular substances such as penicillinase, xylanase or the like. The present invention also provides a method for cultivation of the microorganisms thus prepared to produce the high molecular substances outside the bacterial cell, which comprises inoculating the microorganism in a culture medium containing an inorganic salt necessary for the microorganism to grow, or in a culture medium containing a selected carbon source together with the inorganic salt, keeping on culturing the microorganism, after the concentration of the microorganism cells reached the maximum and until the production and accumulation of the high molecular substances in the media reach the maximum.

Detailed Description of the Invention The term high molecular substances used in the specification and the claims of this application means useful physiologically active compounds including bacterial metabolic products such as enzyme proteins, antibiotics and the like, and biologically active proteins of mammalian origin. The present invention will now be explained in detail. a The Plasmids and their Construction the novel plasmids of the present invention are constructed by inserting a foreign DNA into a plasmid extrachrcanaomal DNA or vector DNA , such as tCo l El, found in Escherichia cells. The vector DNA which can be used in the present invention may have been isolated from natural sources. The DNA fragments unnecessary for self reproduction may have been deleted. Specific exarrgles for vectors which may be used are the plasmids ColE1, 9, pBR322, pSC101, R6K and lambda phage. Foreign DNA fragments or exogenates which can be inserted into the vector DNA are the genes having genetic information of extracellular production or secretion of high molecular substances, such as enzyme proteins, for example, xylanase, penicillinase, alkaline phosphatase, galactosidase, amylase, protease, nglucanase, cellulase and the like. Exogenates or DNA fragments which can be used in the present invention include the genes having genetic information of extracellular production or secretion of high molecular substances. They are obtained from a microorganism which belongs to, for example, the genus Bacillus. An example of a microorganism containing DNA which has genetic information of extracellular penicillinase production and which can be used in the present invention isBacillus sp. No. 170 Horikoshi K. et al 1976 Agric. Biol.Chem., 40 1363 1367 . An example of a microorganism containing DNA which has genetic information of extracellular xylanase production and which can be used in the present invention is Bacillus sp.Cl25. Bacillus sp. C125 isolated from a soil sample collected inTsurugashima, Saitama, Japan shows the following characteristic microbiological properties. Examination and classification of this strain were done according to AerobicSpore forming Bacteria United State Department ofAgriculture, Nov. 1952 by N.R. Smith, R.E. Gordon F.E. Clark and Bergey s Manual of Determinative Bacteriology 1957 .Characteristic Microbiological Properties a Morphology 1 Rods, 0.5 0,7to x 3.0 4.0 S 2 the spore forming oval, 0.6 0.8 C x 1.0 1.2 U and the sporangium is swollen. 3 Gram positive.b Growth on Culture Medium Culture Medium Growth pH7 pHl0 1 Bouillon growing good 2 Bouillon agar 3 Glucose bouillon slightly growing 4 Glucose bouillon agar 5 Tyrosine agar ., 6 Medium I 7 Glucose nitrate growing 8 Glucose asparagine agar nil 9 Medium I 5tNaCl growing c Physiological Properties pH7 pHl0 1 Nitrate reduction no almost nil 2 Utilization of propionate no yes 3 VP test negative negative 4 Urease test negative neutral 5 Hydrolysis of starch positive positive 6 Hydrolysis of case in positive positive 7 Growth condition grows below pub 11.0 and below 55 C 8 Growth under no oxygen no slightly growing condition on Medium I Summarizing the properties above, it is clear that the microorganism belongs to the genus Bacillus because it is an aerobic, spore forming bacterium. The microorganism Bacillus sp. C125 is a new strain of alkalophilic bacteria. It is clearly different from known bacteria in that it grows at a pH lower than 11.0 and at a temperature lower than 55 0C. For the purpose of the insertion of foreign DNA into a vector DNA, any conventional method can be used in the present invention. For instance, chromosomal DNA is digested with a suitable restriction enzyme or endonuclease to obtain a foreign DNA fragment or an exogenote which is then mixed with a vector DNA which has been treated with the same restriction enzyme, and the mixture is ligated by a suitable ligase.Thus, as described before, the novel plasmids of the present invention can be obtained by preparing, with a restriction enzyme, a DNA fragment coding for extracellular production of penicillinase, xylanase or the like, digesting a plasmid vector DNA with a restriction enzyme which does not interfere with genetic information carried on the DNA fragment, treating the DNA fragment and the digested vector plasmid with DNA ligase to construct a recombinant plasmid and isolating the recombinant plasmid by a conventional manner see Bolivaret.al.1Gene, 2, 95 1977 1. The novel plasmid pEAP2 can be constructed from a fragment of Bacillus sp. No. 170 chromosomal DNA and plasmid pMB9. The restrictior enzyme map for plasmid pEAP2 is shown in Fig. 4. As seen fromFig. 4, plasmid pEAP2 is constructed from plasmid pMB9 into fragment of which the Bacillus sp. No. 170 chromosomal DNA coding for extracellular penicillinase production is inserted at theHind III restriction site of plasmid pMB9. Thus, plasmid pEAP2 is a cyclic DNA molecule of about 7700 nucleotide base pairs 7.7 kb , consisting of pMB9 DNA and a fragment of Bacillus sp. No. 170 chromosomal DNA of about 2000 nucletide base pairs 2 kb . a fragment ofThe novel plasmid pCX311 can be constructed from Bacillus sp.C125 chromosomal DNA and plasmid pBR392. The restriction enzyme map for plasmid pCX311 is shown in Fig. 8. As seen fromFig. 8, plasmid pCX311 is constructed from plasmid pBR322 into which the fragment of Bacillus sp. C125 chromosomal DNA coding for extracellular xylanase production is inserted at the HindIII restriction site of plasmid pBR322. Thus, plasmid pCX311 is a cyclic DNA molecule of about 9.01 kb, consisting of pBR322DNA and a fragment of Bacillus sp. C125 DNA of about 4.0 lib. b Preparation of Microorganisms The recombinant plasmids constructed from the chromosomal DNA fragments and the vector DNA plasmids are introduced into a host microorganism of the genus Escherichia by a conventional transformation technique. Cultivation is kept on until stabilized genotype is established, to obtain a transformant carrying both genotypes on the selected chromosomal DNA and on the vector DNA. For this purpose, a conventional, so called shot gun method can be used. A typical host microorganism which can be used in the present invention is Escherichia coli HB101 which is a hybrid strain of Escherichia coli K 12 and Escherichia coli B. The transformant, Escherichia coli HB101 pEAP2 which is prepared by introducing plasmid pEAP2 into Escherichia coli HB 101 has the same microbiological properties as the host, Escherichia coli HB101, except penicillin resistance Molecular Cloning,A Laboratory Manual, p.504 1982 , Genotype F , hsd S 20 rug, mB , rec A13, ara l4, proA2, lacYl, galK2, rpsL20 Sm , xyl 5, mtl l, supE44 E. Coli HB101 pEAP2 is further characterized by the property of plasmid pEAP2, that is, the capability of extracellular production of penicillinase. The extracellular production of penicillinase byEscherichia coli HB101 pEAP2 , as shown in the Examples, reaches more than 80 of total production including the intracellular production and remains after long cultivation.By contrast, more than 80 of the total penicillinase production of the known strain Escherichia coli HB101 pBR322 is intracellular and the extracellular penicillinase production of the known strain, Bacillus sp. No. 170 can not be kept for a long period of time. The present invention which provides Escherichia coli HB 101 pEAP2 having the capability of extracellular production of enzyme proteins such as penicillinase is not only novel but also inventive. Escherichia coli HB101 pEAP2 can produce and secrete into the medium from the cells, in addition to large amounts of penicillinase, large amounts of other enzyme proteins which can also be collected. More specifically, it has been discovered that Escherichia coli HB101 pEAP2 produces and secretes into the medium from the cells large amounts of alkaline phosphatase,ss galactosidase and about ten kinds of proteins which have been observed only within the cells and never outside the cells. Such extracellular production by Escherichia coli HB101 pEAP2 demonstrates that the DNA of about 2000 nucleotide base pairs carried on plasmid pEAP2 provides the host with the capability of extracellular production of the metabolic products. The transformant, Escherichia coli HB101 pCX311 which is prepared by introducing plasmid pCX311 into Escherichia coli HB 101 has the same microbiological properties as the host, Escherichia coli HB101, except penicillin resistance and xylanase production Molecular Cloning, A LaboratoryManual, p.504 1982 , Genotype F , hsd S 20 rug, mB , rec A13, ara 14, proA2, lacYl, galK2, rpsL20 Sm , xyl 5 mtl l, supE44i . Escherichia coli HB101 pCX311 is further characterized by the property of plasmid pCX311, that is, the capability of extracellular production of xylanase. The extracellular production of xylanase by Escherichia coli HB101 pCX311 , as shown in the Examples, reaches more than 80 of total production including the intracellular production and remains after long cultivation.By contrast, extracellular production or activity of xylanase of Bacillus sp. C125, as shown in Fig. 7, reaches the maximum slowly and then, it drops rapidly. Thus, the extracellular production of Bacillus sp. C125 can not be compared with that of Escherichia coli HB101 pCX311 of the present invention. The present invention which provides Escherichia coli HB 101 pCX311 having the capability of extracellular production of enzyme proteins such as xylanase is not only novel but also inventive. E. coli HB101 pCX311 can produce and secrete into the medium from the cells, in addition to large amounts of xylanase, large amounts of other enzyme proteins which can also be collected.More specifically, it has been discovered that Escherichia coliHB 101 pCX311 produces and secretes into the medium from the cells, as shown in the Examples, large amounts of penicillinase, alkaline phosphatase, in addition to xylanase which have ever been observed only in the periplasmic space. Such extracellular production by Escherichia coli HUB101 pCX311 demonstrates that the DNA of about 4000 nucleotide base pairs carried on plasmid pCX311 provides the host with the capability of extracellular production of the metabolic products. c Cultivation of the microorganisms For culturing the transformants prepared in step b , any culture media can be used which are suitable for the production of specific substances for which specific genetic information codes and which are suitable for growth of the microorganisms of the genus Escherichia. In the process of the present invention, it is necessary to culture the microorganism in a culture medium containing an inorganic salt necessary for the microorganism to grow, or a selected carbon source together with the inorganic salt, and to keep on culturing the microorganism, after the concentration of the microorganism cells reached the maximum, and until the production and accumulation of the high molecular substances in the media reach the maximum. Examples of the inorganic salt which can be used in the present invention include sodium and potassium salts such as sodium chloride, sodium sulfate, potassium chloride and the like, among which sodium chloride is preferred. The media containing the inorganic salt or the selected carbon source together with the inorganic salt can contain such carbon sources as glucose, sucrose, lactose, maltose, glycerol, bran, xylan and the like, such nitrogen sources as ammonia water, ammonium salts and the like, inorganic ions and optionally such nutrients as amino acids, vitamins and the like. In the culture ofEscherichia coli HB101 pCX311 , it is important and necessary to add to the medium the carbon source suitable for a selected product.The culture media which can be used in the present invention are those which use, as a basic medium, LB broth containing tryptone, yeast extract and NaCl , BPB broth DifcoLaboratories containing polypeptone, yeast extract and K2HPO4 , nutrient broth Difco 0001 , tryptone NaCl broth or the like. Since more than 80 of total products remain in the intracellular fraction in a medium containing no inorganic salt, it is necessary to use a medium containing an inorganic salt in order that most products are secreted into the culture medium out of the cells. The amount of inorganic salt used is in the range of 0.5 3.0 by weight on the basis of the culture medium. In the culture of Escherichia coli HB101 pEAP2 , excellent results are obtained by the use of LB broth to which glucose and further glycerol have been added as carbon sources, preferably in an amount of 0.1 and 0.28 by weight on the basis of the culture medium, respectively. In the culture of Escherichia coli HB101 pCX311 , excellent results are obtained by the use of LB broth to which bran and or xylan have been added as carbon sources, preferably in the amount each of 0.5 by weight on the basis of the culture medium. Although culture conditions such as pH, temperature, oxygen supply or the like can be changed for the optimum growth of the microorganism of the genus Escherichia, it is necessary, in the present invention, to keep on culturing the microorganism, after the concentration of the microorganism cells reached the maximum, that is to say, after the latter logarithmic phase and until the production and accumulation of the high molecular substances in the medium reach the maximum. After the inoculation of the microorganism of the genusEscherichia in the medium, the cell concentration reaches the maximum after 5 to 20 hours and the production and accumulation of the high molecular substances reach the maximum after 12 to 48 the hours. Although pH of the culture medium is not critical, it is preferred in the range of pH5 pH8, especially pH7. Thus, without further addition of inorganic salt necessary for the microorganism to grow, carbon sources and the like during cultivation, the microorganism produces large amounts of extracellular high molecular substances which can conveniently be collected. According to the culture method of the present invention, in addition to enzyme proteins, such high molecular fermentation products as antibiotics, polysaccharides can be produced in a significant amount. This method can be applied to the cultivation of any microorganisms transformed . th a plasmid carrying a foreign DNA coding for biologically active high molecular substances such as hormone peptides e.g.insulin or interferon and the DNA coding for extracellular production or secretion of biologically active high molecular substances, which leads to mass production of the highmolecular substances such as insulin, interferon and the like. As explaind above, the present invention contributes to the industrial production of useful high molecular substances.

The mixture was heated to 420C for 1 to 2 minutes to introduce the plasmid DNA into the cells. This cell suspension was inoculated in fresh LB broth and cultured at 37 C for 3 to 5 hours with shaking. The cells were collected and washed to obtain Escherichia coli HB101 pEAP2 having the capability of penicillinase production.Example 2 Perparation and purification of plasmid pEAP2 1.

Cell growth cell amount was measured by optical density at 660nm. Extracellular and intracellular penicillinase activities were assayed by the modified Sargent s method Sawai et al tVe Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 13, 910 1978 , wherein enzyme quantity hydrolysing at 30 0C one micro mole of benzylpenicillin per one minute constitutes one unit of penicillinase. As shown in Fig. 1, cell growth of the transformant reached the maximum after 16 hours cultivation and extracellular penicillinase activity began to increase after 20 hours and reached the maximum about 20 units ml after 28 hours cultivation. Extracellul penicillinase produced was very stable and, as shown in Fig. 1 a, the production was kept high even after 48 hours cultivation and reached more than 80 of total enzyme production. In contrast, intracellular penicillinase production was detected at an early phase after 8 to 20 hours cultivation . But, the maximum was only 8 units ml or about 10 of total enzyme production and furthermore, the intracellular production decreased quickly. No intracellular penicillinase activity was observed after 48 hours cultivation.Fig. 1 b shows percentages of extracellular and intracellular penicillinase activities on total enzyme activity. As a comparison, Bacillus sp. No. 170 FERM BP 467 which is a DNA donor and Escherichia coli HB101 pBR322 carrying plasmid pBR322 having genetic information of penicillinase production Boyer et al Gene, vol. 2, p.95 113 1977 were cultured and penicillinase activities were assayed. Bacillus sp. No. 170 was inoculated in 500ml flasks containing 100ml of the broth containing 2.0g of glucose or glycerol, 5.0g of yeast extract, 5.0g of polypeptone, 1.0g ofK2HPO4, 0.2g of MgSO 7H2O and 10g of NaHCO3 in one liter of water and adjusted to pH 9.0 and cultured at 37 0C with shaking. Extracellular penicillinase activity in the culture fluid was observed every four hours. It reached the maximum 19 units ml after 12 hours cultivation and then quickly decreased. No extracellular penicillinase activity was observed after 40 hours cultivation Fig. 2 . On the other hand, Escherichia coli HB101 pBR322 was inoculated in 500ml flasks containing 100ml of LB broth which is the same as that used in the cultivation of Escherichia coliHB101 pEAP2 and cultured at 370C with shaking. As shown inFig 3 a, intracellular penicillinase activity reached the maximum 35 units ml after 20 hours cultivation and it was more than 80 of total enzyme activity. But it decreased quickly. Extracellular penicillinase activity was less than 10 of total enzyme activity. Fig. 3 b shows percentages of extracellular and intracellular penicillinase activities on total enzyme activity. Identification of Penicillinase The culture fluid of the transformant obtained in step 3 of Example 1 was centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 10 minutes. The supernatant fluid was brought to 80 saturation with ammonium sulfate. The precipitate was dissolved in water and the solution was dialyzed overnight against 0.05M phosphate buffer containing 0.1M NaCl pH 7.0 . The dialysate was applied on aSephadex G 75 column equilibrated with the phosphate buffer to obtain purified penicillinase. Similarly, the culture fluid of Bacillus sp. No. 170 was treated to obtain purified penicillinase. For the identification of Escherichia coli HB101 pEAP2 penicillinase with Bacillus sp. No. 170 penicillinase, effects of pH on activity, thermal stability and molecular weight of each penicillinase were investigated. As a result, the enzymes were identical with each other as shown below. a Stability of the enzyme was investigated in buffer solutions of various pH values. The mixture was incubated at 30 C for 45 minutes. Both the enzymes were stable between pH 7 and pH 9 and the optimumps values for enzyme action were 6.0 to 7.0. b Thermal stability was investigated as follows. The enzymes were dissolved in 0.05M phosphate buffer of pH 7.0 and the solutions.were heated at the selected temperature for 10 minutes. The residual activities were measured at pH 7.0.Both the enzymes were stable up to 50 0C. c Estimation of molecular weight of the enzymes was done by using the Sephadex gel filtration method. Estimated molecular weight of both the enzymes was 27,000 to 22,000. Example 4 Culture conditions for penicillinase production byEscherichia coli HB101 pEAP2 FERM BP 468 were examined in the various media.

Example 6 1 Preparation of a chromosomal DNA having genetic information for the production of xylanase. Alkalophilic Bacillus sp. C125 FERM BP 469 having the capability of extracellular production of xylanase was cultured with shaking at 300C for 19 hours in the broth containing 10.0g of bran, 5.0g of yeast extract, 5.0g of polypeptone, 0.2g of MgSO4 7H2O, and 10g of Na2CO3 in one liter of water and adjusted to pH 9.0 . The cells in the latter logarithmic phase were collected, from which a chromosomal DNA was extracted by the phenol extraction method and purified to obtain 5mg of the chromosomal DNA. 2 Insertion of chromosomal DNA fragment into vector DNA. The chromosomal DNA 10 g obtained in step 1 was digested with the restriction enzyme Hind III at 370C for 5, 10, 20, 30 and 60 minutes to obtain DNA fragments. Plasmid pBR322 Bethesda Research Laboratories, U.S.A., tetracyclin resistant Tetr and ampicillin resistant Amp r used as the vector was cut with Hind III, then heated at 650C for 5 minutes, and then mixed with the DNA fragments. The mixture was treated with T4 phage DNA ligase at 10 0C for 24 hours and then heated at 650C for 5 minutes. Three times volume of ethanol was added to the mixture.Plasmids carrying the chromosomal DNA fragments were precipitated and collected. 3 Transformation of the microorganism with plasmids having gene for extracellular production of xylanase. Escherichia coli HB101 which is a hybrid strain ofEscherichia coli K 12 and Escherichia coli B, was inoculated in 10ml of LB broth containing 10g of tryptone DifcoLaboratories, Detroit, Mich. , 5g of yeast extract, lg of glucose and 10g of NaCl in one liter of deionized water pH was adjusted to 7.0 and cultured at 37 0C with shaking until the latter logarithmic phase. The cells were collected and suspended in an ice cold CaC12 solution of 0.03M final concentration to obtain competent cells. The cell suspension and the plasmid solution obtained in step 2 were combined and kept on ice for 60 minutes. The mixture was heated to 420C for 1 to 2 minutes to introduce the plasmid DNA into the cells.This cell suspension was inoculated in fresh LB broth and cultured at 37 C for 3 to 5 hours with shaking. The cells were collected and washed to obtain transformants, from whichEscherichia coli HB101 pCX311 FERM BP 470 having extracellular producibility of xylanase and penicillinase was isolated. Example 7 Preparation and purification of plasmid pCX311 The procedure of Example 2 was repeated. However, Escherichia coli HBl0l pCX3ll FERM BP 470 was used instead fo Escherichia coli HB101 pEAP2 FERM BP468 . lmg l broth of purified plasmid pCX311 was obtained. Example 8 Escherichia coli HB101 pCX311 FERM BP 470 obtained in step 3 of Example 6 was inoculated in 500ml flasks containing 100ml of LB broth containing 10g of tryptone, 5g of yeast extract, Ig of glucose, 2g of glycerol, 10g of NaCl and lOmg of penicillin in one liter of water containing 0.5 xylan and cultured at 37 0C with shaking. Cell growth was measured by optical density at 660nm. Enzyme activity was assayed as follows 0.05ml of the culture fluid, O.lml of xylan solution Seikagaku Kogyo, Japan and 0.lml of 0.2M Tris malate buffer of pH8.0 were mixed and heated at 400C for 10 minutes.One ml of DNS 3.5 dinitrosalicylic acid was added to the mixture, which was then heated at 1000C for 5 minutes. Four ml of water was added to the mixture. Absorbance at 510nm was measured.One unit of xylanase reduces one mg of xylose per one minute. Fig. 5 shows extracellular production or secretion of xylanase by Escherichia coli HB101 pCX311 cultured in the LBbroth containing 0.5 xylan. As shown in fig. 5, cell growth of the transformant reached the maximum after 9 to 12 hours cultivation and extracellular xylanase activity began to increase after 6 hours and reached the maximum about 0.35 unit ml after 13 hours cultivation. Extracellular xylanase produced was very stable and, as shown in fig. 5, the production was kept high even after 48 hours cultivation and reached more than 80 of total enzyme production. In contrast, intracellular xylanase production was detected a little at an early phase after 9 hours cultivation . But, the maximum was only 0.13 unit ml or about 10 of total enzyme production and furthermore, the intracellular production decreased gradually. Fig. 6 shows xylanase production by Escherichia coli HB101 pCX311 cultured in the LB broth containing 0.5 bran instead of xylan. Fig. 6 shows the similar tendency as observed in Fig. 5. As a comparison, Bacillus sp. C125 FERM FERM BP 469 which is a DNA donor was cultured and xylanase activity was assayed. Bacillus sp. C125 was inoculated in 500ml flasks containing 100ml of the medium which contained 10.0g of xylan, 5.0g of yeast extract, 5.0g of polypeptone, l.Og of K2HPO4, 0.2g of MgS0497H2O and 10g of Na2CO3 in one liter of water and was adjusted to pH 6.0 and cultured at 370C with shaking.Extracellular xylanase activity in the culture fluid was observed every eight hours. It began to increase after eight hours cultivation and reached the maximum about 0.5 unit ml after 48 hours, but it decreased quickly Fig. 7 . Identification of xylanase Ammonium sulfate was added to the culture fluid of the transformant obtained in step 3 of Example 6. The precipitate salted out was dissolved in water and the solution was dialyzed overnight against running water. The dialyzate was adsorbed on a CM cellulose column equilibrated with 20mM phosphoric acid monosodium phosphate buffer of pH 4.5. Elution was done by applying a linear gradient of O.l 0.7M sodium chloride. Xylanase was eluted with about 0.4M sodium chloride. The fractions exhibited xylanase activity were combined and applied on a Sephadex G 100 gel filtration to obtain purified xylanase. Similarly, the culture fluid of Bacillus sp. C125 FERMBP 469 was treated to obtain purified xylanase. For the identification of Escherichia coli HB101 pCX311 xylanase with Bacillus sp. C125 xylanase, effects of pH on activity, ultracentrifugal analysis, electrophoresis and estimation of molecular weight of each xylanase were examined.As a result, both the enzymes were identical with each other as shown below. a Acetate, pH 4 5 , Tris malate pH 5 8 , Tris HCl pH 7 9 , and glycine NaOH pH 9 11 were prepared. Using these buffer solutions, effects of pH on activity was examined.Results are shown in Fig. 9 which exhibits the identification of both the enzymes on pH activity. b Ultracentrifugal analysis showed that both the enzymes had single peak of about 3.5S of sedimentation coefficient. c Desk electrophoresis at pH 8.3 showed that both the enzymes had single band. Electrofocusing by Ampholine showed single peak. Isoelectric point of both the enzymes was pH6.3. d Estimation of molecular weight of the enzymes was done bySDS polyacrylamide method. Estimated molecular weight of both the enzymes was about 40,000. Example 9 Escherichia coli HB101, Escherichia coli HB101 pBR322 and Escherichia coli HB101 pCX311 FERM BP 470 were cultured in the same, xylan containing LB broth as used in Example 8 at 37 0C with shaking for 20 hours penicillinase or for 15 hours alkaline phosphatase and p galactosidase3. Enzyme activities of alkaline phosphatase and galactosidase were measured by optical density at 420nm. Results are given in Table 6.
