The device comprises a sleeve 1 with a bore conformed to the shaft, and a ring 2 movably connected to the sleeve in the axial direction and also having a bore conformed to the shaft. A member 8 is arranged in the sleeve and adapted to act on the ring 2 in such a manner that this is fixed in an inclined position relative to the shaft B , and thereafter to move the sleeve 1 away from the ring 2 along the shaft so that the sleeve will urge the object A against the stop C .
