# Non consumable composite welding electrode.

## Abstract
A tungsten inert gas shielded non consumable compo site welding electrode 10 having a solid tungsten rod center 12 and a concentric outer sleeve 14 which has an electrical resistivity substantially lower than the tungsten rod, and which is bonded adhesively and cohesively to the tungsten rod 12 by flame spraying so that the surface irregularities of the mating surface areas of the tungsten rod 12 and the outer sleeve 14 mechanically interlock. This arrangement results in an increase of the operating life and of the current carrying capacity of the electrode, particularly in narrow groove weld ing applications.
