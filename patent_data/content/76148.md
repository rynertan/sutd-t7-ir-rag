# System for controlling the transmission torque of a four wheel drive vehicle.

## Abstract
A control system for a four wheel drive vehicle for automatically changing the transmission torque to rear wheels has a fluid pressure controlled friction clutch 22 which is in partial engagement state for ordinary driving conditions and which transmits the power of the engine to the rear wheels, so that, when the vehicle turns a corner, the friction clutch slips to allow the rear wheels to rotate slower than the front wheels. A load sensor 45 and a slip detecting device 42, 43 produce control signals. A control circuit 46 responds to the control signals to increase the engagement of the friction clutch 22 to provide adequate four wheel driving.
