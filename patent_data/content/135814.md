The compounds of this invention can be used as agents to combat bacterial infections including urinary tract infections and respiratory infections in mammalian species. such as domesticated animals e.4.. dogs. cats, cows, horses, and the like and humans. For combating bacterial infections in mammals a compound of this invention can be administered to a mammal in need thereof in an amount of about 1.4 mg kg day to about 350 mg kg day, preferably about 14 mg kg day to about 100 mg kg day. All modes of administration which have been used in the past to deliver penicillins and cephalosporins to the site of the infection are also contemplated for use with the novel family of B lactams of this invention.Such methods of administration include oral, intravenous, intramuscular, and as a suppository. The ss lactams of this invention can be prepared from an amino acid having the formula EMI16.1 The amino group is first protected with a classical protecting group e.q., t butoxycarbonyl. benzyloxyearbonyl, o nitrophenylsulfenyl, etc. , yielding the compound having the formulaEMI16.2 In formula III, and throughout the specification, the symbol A1 refers to a nitrogen protecting group. For certain products of formula I, the desired acyl group R1W can be used as the protecting group A11 and thus incorporated at the beginning of the reaction sequence. The carboxyl group of a protected amino acid of formula III is then reacted with an amine having the formula IV Y O NH2In formula IV, and throughout the specification.the symbol Y refers to benzyl, pivaloyl. CH2CH NHA2 C02alkyl, t butyl. nitrobenzyl, benzyhydryl. 2 cyanoethyl, 2 trimethylsilylethyl, trichloroethyl, anisyl, inter alia wherein the symbol A2 refers to a nitrogen protecting group . The reaction proceeds in the presence of a coupling agent such as l ethyl 3 3 dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide or dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. and yields a compound having the formulaEMI17.1 The hydroxyl group of a compound of formula V is converted to a leaving group. using, for example, a classical reagent such as methanesulfonyl chloride methanesulfonyl is referred to hereinafter as Ms . The fully protected compound having the formulaEMI17.2 is cyclized by treatment with base. e.o., potassium carbonate. The reaction is preferably carried out in an organic solvent such as acetone. under reflux conditions. and yields a compound having the formulaEMI17.3 Compounds of formula VII wherein Y is benzyl are disclosed in the literature see, for example.J.A.C.S., 104 6054 1982 . Alternatively, cyclization of a compound of formula V can be accomplished without first converting the hydroxyl group to a leaving group.Treatment of a compound of formula V with triphenylphosphine and diethylazodicarboxylate or carbon tetrachloride, yields a compound of formulaVII. Both of the methods disclosed above for ring closure of a compound of formula V result in the inversion of the stereochemistry of the R3 andR4 substituents. Selective reduction of a compound of formulaVII using catalytic hydrogenation if Y is benzyl or by treatment with a base such as sodium sulfide or sodium hydroxide if Y is pivaloyl or with DBU ifY is CH2CH NHA2 Co2alkyl yields the corresponding compound having the formulaEMI18.1 Alkylation of a hydroxamic acid of formulaVIII with a compound having the formulaEMI18.2 wherein Z is a suitable leaving group. such as a halogen atom preferably bromine or chlorine , a mesylate or triflate group, or any one of the other leaving groups well known in the art, and R7 is alkyl, phenyl, substituted phenyl, phenylalkyl, or substituted phenyl alkyl, yields the corresponding compound having the formulaEMI18.3 To obtain a compound having the formulaEMI19.1 the corresponding compound of formula X, whereinR7 is benzyl can be treated with hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst e.q., palladium on charcoal . Tetrazole derivatives of formula IX are disclosed in the literature see. for exaple, J. Org. Chem., 17 1597 1952 . Deprotection of the 3 amino substitutent of a compound of formula X or XI can be accomplished using art recognized techniques. If, for example.the protecting group is t butoxycarbonyl, trifluoro acetic acid can be used to deprotect the amino group. If the protecting group is benzyloxycarbonyl, catalytic e.g., palladium on charcoal hydrogenation can be used. If the protecting group is o nitrophenylsulfenyl, toluenesulfonic acid can be used in combination with E thiocresol. The deprotected compound has the formulaEMI19.2 and is a key intermediate for preparing the compounds of this invention. The compounds of formula XII form an integral part of this invention. Well known acylation techniques can be used to convert a compound of formula XII to the corresponding compound having the formulaEMI20.1 Exemplary techniques include reaction with a carboxylic acid R1 OH or corresponding carboxylic acid halide or carboxylic acid anhydride. The reactions with a carboxylic acid proceed most readily in the presence of a carbodiimide such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and a substance capable of forming a reactive intermediate in situ such as N hydroxybenzotriazole or N hydroxysuccinimide. Alternatively, the reaction with a carboxylic acid can be run in the presence of N methyl N trimethylsilyl trifluoro acetamide MSTFA and a substance capable of forming a reactive intermediate in situ such asN hydroxybenzotriazole.In those instances wherein the acyl group R1 contains reactive functionality such as amino or carboxyl groups it may be necessary to first protect these functional groups, then carry out the acylation reaction. and finally deprotect the resulting product. The products of formula I wherein R2 is methoxy can be prepared from the corresponding compound of formula VII. Halogenating preferably chlorinating the amide nitrogen of a compound of formula VII yields a compound having the formula EMI21.1 Reagents and procedures of N chlorinating amides are well known in the art. Exemplary reagents are tert. butyl hypochlorite, sodium hypochlorite, and chlorine. The reaction can be run in an organic solvent e.q., a lower alkanol such as methanol or in a two phase solvent system e.q., waterS methylene chloride in the presence of a base such as sodium borate decahydrate. The reaction is preferably run at a reduced temperature. Reaction of a compound of formula XIV with a methoxylating agent, e.q., an alkali metal methoxide. yields a compound in combination with its enantiomer if R3 and R4 are the same or ifXIV is a racemic mixture having the formulaEMI21.2 The reaction can be run in an organic solvent, e.q., a polar organic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, at a reduced temperature. Alternatively, a compound of formula VII can be converted to a compound of formula XV using a single step procedure. The methoxylating agent can first be mixed with a compound of formula VII and the N chlorinating reagent then added to the reaction mixture. Conversion of a compound of formula XV to the desired product of formula I can be accomplished using the procedures described above for the conversion of an intermediate of formula VII to a product of this invention.

Stirring was continued at 0 C to 50C for 25 minutes. The solution was evaporated in vacuo at 0 C, the oily residue treated three times with anhydrous ether, and the solid ss lactam was filtered off and dried over P205 to give 1.6g of the title compound.B 3S 3 alpha Z ,4ss 2 Amino alpha methoxyimino N 4 methyl 2 oxo 1 1 phenylmethyl 1H tetrazol5 ylmethoxy 3 azetidinyl 4 thiazoleacetamide 1.4ml of MSTFA 7.5 mmol was added to a solution of 1.0g of 3S trans 3 amino 4 methyl2 oxo 1 1 phenylmethyl 1H tetrazol 5 ylmethoxy azetidine, trifluoroacetate 2.5 mmol in 20ml of dry acetonitrile at 0 C. Stirring was continued for 4.5 hours at room temperature. After evaporation in vacuo, the residual oil was dissolved in 20ml of dry tetrahydrofuran, 0.75g of Z 2 amino alpha methoxyimino 4 thiazoleacetic acid, l hydrobenzotriazole ester 2.3 mmol was added and the mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature.The solvent was evaporated in vacuo, and the residue was taken up in ethyl acetate, shaken with ice cold aqueous NaHCO3 1N and subsequently with ice cold water. The ethyl acetate layer was dried with Na2S04 and the title compound was chromatographed on silica gel with ethyl acetate.
