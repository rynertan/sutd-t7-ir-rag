# Protection of sensitive material.

## Abstract
Sensitive material, e.g. lithium, for lithium cell electrodes, is protected by providing relatively fluid impermeable material, e.g. polyethylene, to protect the sensitive material and altering the physical structure of the protective material, preferably by stretching at the same time as thinning the lithium or other sensitive material, to render it relatively fluid permeable, preferably so as to serve as an electrode separator when the protected lithium is incorporated in a cell.
