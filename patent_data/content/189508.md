# Method of making short fiber preform.

## Abstract
A preform for being embedded in a matrix material for making a composite material is made essentially of many short fibers stuck together by a quantity of dried binder. This preform has a first portion in which the fiber volume proportion is relatively high, a second portion in which the fiber volume proportion is relatively low, and a third portion, joining between the first portion and the second portion, in which the fiber volume proportion changes substantially continuously from its portion adjoining to the first portion to its portion adjoining to the second portion. Thereby, the characteristics of the composite material, such as its strength, heat and wear resistance, and machinability and workability and characteristics with respect to wear on a mating member, alter smoothly from the first portion to the second portion without any severe discontinuity, thus ensur ing that no points of weakness are caused. A method for making such a preform, and a composite material object manufactured using such a preform, which may be an engine piston, are also disclosed.
