# PRESSURE SENSOR

## Abstract
A pressure sensor for attachment to a tyre comprises sensing means 9 exposed to the pressure of the tyre in use and movable against resilience 11 in response to changes in the tyre pressure and transmitting means not shown connected to an electrical circuit. The arrangement is such that on movement of the sensing means 9 in excess of a predetermined amount an electrical current is caused to flow in the electrical circuit, the electrical current causing the transmitting means to transmit a signal.
