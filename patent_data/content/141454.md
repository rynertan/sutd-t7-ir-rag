# ENERGY RECOVERY WINCH TO OPERATE CURTAINS AND ROLLER BLINDS

## Abstract
A curtain winding up winch is provided with a control device with bevel gears 9 11 having a 1 1 ratio. In order to allow lifting the curtain and ensuring the irreversibility of such action the winch is provided with an irreversibility device formed by a helical spring 33 , which is enclosed within a block 41 rigidly connected to the handgrip 7 and is engaged on a sector bushing 15 having a rotational clearance relative to the hub 37 of the first control bevel gear 9 . Coaxially mounted on the second bevel gear 11 is a control shaft 13 coaxial to the curtain winding up roller 17 and rigidly connected to it extending between said shaft 13 and the curtain winding up roller 17 is a double helical spring 27 fixed at one end to the control housing 7 , and at the other end rigidly connected at 29 to the curtain winding up roller 17 .
