# Gas analysis.

## Abstract
A stream of internal combustion engine effluent gas is an alysed for combustible or combustion supporting constitu ents by separately in time passing an untreated sample of the gas and a sample treated by addition of whichever of a com bustible and a combustion supporting constituent it is defi cient in through a reaction zone maintained in conditions effec tive to cause mutual reaction of combustible and combustion supporting constituents and containing a temper ature sensor, and measuring the difference in temperature be tween untreated and treated samples as the result of subjec tion to those conditions. According to the drawing a stream of exhaust gas is equi librated in zone 15 and divided into two streams, one of which receives an addition of gasoline vapour in chamber 22B, while the other passes through chamber 22A without addition. Then the streams from chambers 22A and 22B are passed alter natingly over hot wire 30 by the action of valve 27 actuated by external electromagnet 29.
