# Fluorophosphate glasses.

## Abstract
Fluorophosphate glasses are disclosed that have very low transition temperatures, very high refractive indices and dielectric constants, and are resistant to moisture attack. The glasses are free of alkali metals and contain on a cation percent basis 20 to 70 Hg, 20 to 70 P and up to 40 TI and contain not over 200 fluorine atoms on a corresponding basis. The melted glass is largely oxide in nature, but the halogens appear to facilitate melting of these soft glasses.
