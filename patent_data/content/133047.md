# Recording and reproducing apparatus for recording and reproducing a carrier chrominance signal.

## Abstract
A recording and reproducing apparatus for recording a carrier chrominance signal, comprises a separating circuit 13 for separating a carrier chrominance signal from a color video signal, a recording signal processing circuit for convert ing the carrier chrominance signal into a carrier chrominance signal having a signal format suited for recording and repro duction 16 , a recording circuit 17 for recording an output signal of the recording signal processing circuit on a record ing medium 19a , a reproducing circuit 21 for reproducing the recorded signal from the recording medium 196 , a reproduced signal processing 25 circuit for converting the reproduced signal from the reproducing circuit into a repro duced carrier chrominance signal having an original signal format, and a de emphasis circuit 26 responsive to the reproduced carrier chrominance signal from the reproduced signal processing circuit, for subjecting the reproduced car rier chrominance signal to a de emphasis so that a high frequency component in a vertical spatial frequency of the reproduced carrier chrominance signal is relatively attenu ated compared to a low frequency component of the repro duced carrier chrominance signal.
