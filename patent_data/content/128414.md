# METHOD OF SANITIZING TOILETS

## Abstract
A method for sanitizing flush toilets wherein a sanitiz ing agent and a phenothiazine or phenoxazine dyestuff are dispensed into the toilet flush water. The dyestuff is resistant to attack by the sanitizing agent and therefore provides an aesthetically pleasing color to the water remaining in the bowl during the time period between flushes.
