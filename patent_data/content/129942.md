# Electron beam apparatus comprising a wire source.

## Abstract
An electron beam apparatus comprises an electron source with an electron emitter in the form of a wire suitably of metal, which slides on two supports. The supports are con structed and spaced apart at such a distance, not more than 1mm, that for the wire portion between the supports a thermal equilibrium is achieved which is optimum for high electron emission from a small area of the wire. The metal wire can be heated to a temperature just below its melting point and is transported via the supports under a low tensile stress.
