# Method for the manufacture of twistless or substantially twistless yarn and yarn whenever manufactured by the application of this method.

## Abstract
In a method for the manufacture of twistless yarn a sliver of staple fibre material is drafted in two drafting zones, which are separated by a neutral zone. The drafting in the first zone occurs in a dry condition and in the second zone in a wet condition. The drafting liquid, which can contain a bonding agent, is supplied to the sliver through a false twister inserted in the neutral zone. This drafting process provides and increased uniformity of twistless yarn in a range of counts of 10 300 tex at a production rate of 300 to 600 m min.
