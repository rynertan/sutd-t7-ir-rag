# A combined communication, security and alarm radio system.

## Abstract
A system for supervising equipment in a plant or installation, in which a base transmitter receiver 4 is in two way communication with a remote control unit 2 . A plurality of portable transmitter receiver units 12 enables direct communication between operators through the base transmitter receiver unit 4 . An alarm message unit 8 connected to both the control unit 2 and a telephone exchange landline enables pre recorded messages to be transmitted in sequence to a plurality of subscribers. Each portable transmitter receiver unit 12 has a push button 27 to activate the alarm message unit 8 through the base transmitter 4 each being recognizable by its own tone. The system also includes a paging transmitter 6 and up to as many paging receivers 14 as there are portable units 12 . A plant alarm unit 10 is automatically activated when failure or malfunctioning of equipment occurs or when there is unauthorized entry, this causing the paging transmitter 6 to operate instantaneously and the alarm message unit 8 to operate after a predetermined delay.
