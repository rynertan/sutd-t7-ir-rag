# BOX ASSEMBLY FOR FIBER OPTIC MULTIPLEXER DUPLEXER

## Abstract
A box assembly for enclosing and retaining an optical multiplexer duplexer , the multiplexer duplexer compris ing a plurality of expanded beam lens assemblies, asso ciated normal incidence bandpass optical filters, and a dichroic beamsplitter. The box assembly includes a plurality of clamps maintained in a substantially fixed relationship by virtue of clips inserted into and through flangelike portions extending at the ends of clamps. A pair of brackets inserted into the enclosure defined by the clamps operate to secure the dichroic beamsplitter. Gauge pins, fitting into notches cut out of the ends of the brackets, facilitate the insertion and retention of the beamsplitter. A pair of filter retainers, ex hibiting a contours complimentary to the contours of the brackets are positioned in abutment with the brackets so as to properly align the normal incidence filters with the lens assemblies. A lid is provided to cover the enclosure defined by the brackets.
