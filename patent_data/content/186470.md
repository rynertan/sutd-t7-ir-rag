# SEALANT COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS FOR USE IN DETECTING EQUIPMENT TAMPERING

## Abstract
Sealant compositions and methods which are particular ly adaptable for use in detecting movement between two or more adjacent surfaces. The preferred sealant composition of the present invention is comprised of a paint base, such as a latex floor enamel, to which is added a thickening agent. One suitable thickening agent is a texture paint containing silica and silicates. When applied to a surface or series of surfaces, the sealant composition dries to a putty like consistency. When spread over a portion of two adjacent surfaces and the joint therebetween, the paint forms a smooth continuous surface. If the two surfaces are moved with respect to one another, however, an irreparable tear occurs in the paint surface as a result, movement between the two surfaces is readily detected. This sealant composi tion is particularly useful in detecting tampering with utility meters.
