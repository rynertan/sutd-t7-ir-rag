# Calf screening.

## Abstract
A screening system for assessing passive immunity in a multiplicity of calves involves collecting a blood sample from each of a multiplicity of calves establishing and maintaining a correlation between each blood sample and the respective calf contacting a predetermined volume of each blood sample with a predetermined amount of an anti IgG under assay conditions which will visualize the immunoreaction between Ig in the sample and the anti IgG monitoring the immunoreaction for each contacted blood sample to deter mine the presence positive result or absence negative result of a preset level of immunoglobulin G in each blood sample and identifying the calves which show a positive result and or the calves which show a negative result.
