## Description
POLYURETHANE SPRAY COMPOSITION, A METHOD OF MAKING A CURED POLYURETHANE ARTICLE THEREFROM, AND A CURED POLYURETHANE This invention relates to a method of making a polyurethane, compositions useful in such method, and a polyurethane produced by such method. In one aspect, the invention is concerned with a method of .making a cured polyurethane article by spraying comprising the steps of i providing a composition which is a mixture of a a polyurethane prepolymer b a curative for the polyurethane prepolymer and c as a viscosity reducing agent, one or a com bination of substances selected from the group consisting of the monoethers of ethylene glycol, the monoethers of diethylene glycol, their acetates, the thioethers, their oxides and cyclic thioether oxides. having boiling points above 1000C and capable of dissolving b ii spraying the said mixture onto a surface and iii thereafter subjecting the sprayed mixture to curing conditions. Polyurethanes generally comprise as essential components a polyol such as a higher molecular weight glycol, a polyisocyanate such as a diisocyanate, and a curative or chain extender such as a relatively low molecular weight polyamine or polyol. There are numerous applications for polyurethanes which are prepared by spray methods especially when it is deisred to apply a coating of polyurethane onto a surface. The two main spray methods are 1 One shot system and, 2 Prepolymer system. In the one shot system usually two low viscosity streams of materials are employed, namely a polyisocyanate and, b mixture of polyol and curative. The one shot system 1 suffers certain deficiences especially the sensitivity of the polyisocyanate to moisture. Under humid conditions, even at a relatively short period of exposure to moisture in the air, the highly concentrated and reactive polyisocyanate tends to combine with the water present leading to extensive foaming in the resultant polyurethane. The advantages include working with low viscosity liquid materials and the general solubility of curatives in the polyols. The prepolymer system 2 essentially employs two ingredient feed streams, namely i Polyurethane prepolymer and, ii curative s wherein i is a reaction product of polyisocyanate and a suitable polyol having residual reactive isocyanate moiety, and ii is a polyamine or polyol essentially used for providing the desired amount of chain extension and or crosslinking. The disadvantage of this system lies in the rather high viscosity of such prepolymers i and the oftentimes solid nature of the curative ii . It has been the practice to add certain inert volatile organic solvents in order to reduce the viscosity of the prepolymer i and place the curative ii into solution. The prepolymer system leads to a product having physical properties superior to those of the one shot system because in the latter the polyol and curatives compete with each other in the reaction with polyisocyanate, yet, the solvents added about 30 to 70 by volume such as toluene, methyl ethyl ketone, ethyl acetate, xylene etc., create hazards to human health because of toxicity or chances of explosion and fires. In addition, these solvents may be lost unless costly ventilation and recovery systems are installed. This invention relates to the use of a viscosity modifier which when added to a urethane prepolymer system, sufficiently decreases viscosity and readily dissolves or solvates useful polyurethane curatives so that the two components prepolymer and curative can be readily metered, mixed, and sprayed using conventional commercial spray equipment. The viscosity modifier employed in the invention is a substance which essentially is not readily volatile and hence the system is free of volatile solvents. The novel viscosity modifier employed in the invention is one or a combination of the following the monoethers of ethylene glycol, the monoethers of diethylene glycol, their acetates, the thioethers, their oxides and cyclic thioether oxides. Generally their boiling points are above 100 C and they are capable of dissolving common polyurethane curatives. The invention accordingly pertains to the use of a non volatile modifier to dissolve solid components and to reduce viscosity of urethane prepolymer systems so that they are sprayable on conventional equipment. As indicated, certain solventless systems of commerce are based on one shot urethanes. That is, one component of the system is a mixture of a polyol and a low molecular weight diol and the other is a diphenyl methane diisocyanate MDI modified such that it is liquid. In some cases, the modified MDI can be described as a quasi prepolymer and contains a very high percentage of reactive diisocyanate. Prepolymer spray systems of commerce contain high levels 30 70 of volatile solvents the purpose of which is to reduce viscosity and increase work life such that metering, mixing and spraying may be obtained. U.S. 4,195,148, March 25, 1980, Hagen, teaches that lactone viscosity modifiers, in particular gamma butyrolactone, are effective in reducing viscosity and solvating the curatives. The problem with such modifiers is that the compositions are not stable, thus limiting both the time and the temperature of use. This invention accordingly pertains to the use of essentially non volatile modifiers which dissolve solid components, reduce viscosity of the urethane system and allow the system to remain stable with time and temperature such that they can be sprayed with conventional equipment even after extended periods of time have elapsed since their preparation. Previously, the art has used conventional plasticizers such as dioctylphthalate, butylbenzylphthalate, dipropyleneglycoldibenzoate, etc. to reduce viscosity of solventless sprayable urethane but these have been poor and less effective in both solvating solid components and reducing the viscosity than the more recent lactones, in particular gamma butyrolactone. Lactones, however, although effective, react with the components of a urethane system and therefore lack storage stability. The modifiers of this invention are even more effective solvators for the solid components, more effective viscosity reducers and they are stable with the urethane components. This invention has significant advantages over those of the prior art. One shot spray systems are based on MDI and are always moisture sensitive. They cannot be used under humid conditions without extensive blowing or foaming due to reaction with moisture. Those of this invention based on MDI are less subject to blowing than one shot systems since they contain considerably less reactive isocyanate 2 16 vs. 20 30 of the prior art . Those based on other isocyanates are much less sensitive to this limitation. Another major advantage of the prepolymer spray system of this invention is the superior properties of the urethane it produces versus those of the one shot systems. This difference is well known in the industry and includes such important properties as abrasion resistance, cut and tear resistance and tensile strength. The spray systems of this invention also have major advantages when compared to prepolymer systems dissolved in volatile solvents to facilitate spraying . The major advantages are a. The solventless spray can apply high coating thick nesses 25 40 mil per pass but solvented systems can only apply 5 10 mil. This decreases application time. b. Tack free time is very short 0.5 2.0 min. compared to solvented systems 15 30 min. and allows quick recoat and handling. c. The explosion and inhalation hazards associated with volatile solvents are avoided. d. Shrinkage of the coating is reduced or eliminated. The significant advantage over the lactone modifiers Is the ability to remain stable with time and temperature. Prepolymers useful in this invention are the reaction products of polyols with diisocyanates such as methylene diphenyldiisocyanate MDI , tolylene diisocyanate TDI , bitolylene diisocyanate, hexamethylene diisocyanate, hydrogenated MDI, and isophorone diisocyanate. Polyols can be those generally used to make prepolymers including but not limited to Polytetramethylene ether glycol of 650 3000 MW Polypropylene ether glycol of 200 3000 MW Polycaprolactone glycol of 500 2000 MW Polyethylene adipate glycol of 500 3000 MW Polyethylene propylene adipate glycol of 500 3000 MW Polyethylene butylene adipate glycol of 500 3000 MW Polybutylene adipate glycol of 500 3000 MW Polyoxyethylene ether glycol of 200 4000 MW Polybutadiene glycol Castor Oil Reactive isocyanate contents of the prepolymers typically can range from 2 to 16 by weight. Curatives for these prepolymers are conventional and generally consist of diamines, such as methylene dianiline MDA , 4,4 methylene bis orthchloroaniline , trimethylene glycol di p aminobenzoate, bis o aminophenylthio ethane, 4,4 methylene bis dimethylanthranilate , and the like. Mixture of diamines or of diamines with diols such as 1, 4 butanediol or one of the polyols listed above can be used to modify reaction rates and thus decrease or increase tack free time as required by the application. As pointed out previously, the viscosity modifier is one or a combination of the following a the monoethers of ethylene glycol e.g., ethylene glycol monobutyl ether B.P. 169 C b the monoethers of diethylene glycol e.g., diethylene glycol monobutyl ether B P. 227 C c their acetates e. g., ethyleneglycolmonobutyl ether acetate B.P. 2350C d the thioethers e.g., thiodiethanol B.P. 2830C e their oxides e.g., dimethylsulfoxide B.P. 1880C f cyclic thioether oxides e. g., tetrahydrothiophene 1,1 dioxide B.P. 2850C The preferred modifier is tetrahydrothiophene 1 dioxide. Equivalent ratios of the reactive components, curatives to prepolymer, can range from 0.75 to 1.30, with .85 to 1.20 being typical and 0.90 to 1.00 being preferred. The modifier can be used from 1 to 200 parts per hundred parts curative with a preferred range of 5 to 50 parts per hundred parts curative. The modifier should preferably not be used at levels above 100 pph polyurethane prepolymer plus curative by weight in order to avoid polyurethane properties at levels lower than desired. For example, a range of 1 to 100 pph modifier to total polyurethane is frequently possible 5 to 50 pph is usually employed. This invention will permit material temperatures to range from ambient to 1000C with a preferred temperature range of 350C 700C. As is well known, polyurethane curatives ordinarily contain a plurality of active hydrogen sites, ordinarily two active hydrogens, such as are provided by OH, NH2, SH groups, or the like.Most frequently the curative is a polyamine or a polyol, especially a diamine or a diol. Curing conditions may be conventional i.e., ambient conditions or elevated temperatures . The following examples in which all quantities are expressed by weight unless otherwise indicated will serve to illustrate the practice of the invention in more detail. EXAMPLE 1 This example demonstrates the superior stability obtainable with a viscosity modifier of the invention, viz., tetrahydrothio phene 1,1 dioxide, in comparison to a prior art viscosity modifier, butyrolactone. Stability is evaluated by observing the mixture of curative and viscosity modifier component B of the spray system to determine the length of time, at a particular test temperature, before a precipitate appears. Polytetramethylene ether glycol of 1000 molecular weight PTMEG MW 1000 tolylene diisocyanate prepolymer of 6 3 NCO content is used as one component A of the solventless spray system. The other B is prepared by dissolving 45 parts of methylene dianiline MDA in 55 parts of tetrahydrothiophene 1,1dioxide. This material Is cast by hand in a 3 1 ratio A B with the prepolymer at 650C and the B package at 250C. This is compared directly with a ng package using MDA and butyrolactone, Tetrahydrothiophene .dioxide ButyrolactoneTack Free 45 Seconds 40 SecondsHardness 86A 90A fB Stability at 1000C 24 Weeks 3 Days B at 700C 4 2 Weeks B at Ambient Indefinite 3 6 Months Stability, as measured by the time required for appearance of a precipitate, is seen to be remarkably greater in the tetrahydro thiophene l dioxide system then in the lactone system. A loss of reactivity and physical properties accompanies the precipitate.Infra red analysis determines the precipitate to be an amide. No spectral diffeences can be determined with the tetrahydrothiophene1,1 dioxide after 4 weeks at 1000C. EXAMPLE 2 A modified B package is prepared using a PTMEG 1000 MDA and tetrahydrothiophene 1 ,1 dioxide in a weight ratio of 1 to 0.6 to 0.2. This package is shown to be an ambient liquid demonstrating superior solvating power of this modifier. This B package is sprayed with the prepolymer of Example 1 in the raio of 3 1 A B on a Graco Hydracat trademark spray system. The resulting composite is tack free in 60 seconds and a tough film is obtained having a Shore hardness of 80A. Example 1 is repeated using the viscosity modifiers of the invention listed in the following table, which also shows preferred ranges of amounts for each expressed in parts per hundred parts by weight of curative. The modifiers provide ambient stability for an indefinite period of time, that is, no precipitate is observed in the mixture of modifier and curative even after extended periods of time at room temperature.
