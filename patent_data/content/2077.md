## Description
PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF ESTERS OF SUBSTITUTED CYCLOPROPANE CARBOXYLIC ACIDS AND THE NOVEL ESTERS PRODUCED THEREBY This invention relates to a process for the preparation of esters of substituted cyclopropanecarboxylic acids and to the novel esters produced thereby. Substituted cyclopropanecarboxylic acids are useful intermediates in the preparation of pesticidally active esters thereof, especially the 3 phenoxybenzyl and alpha cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl esters these pesticidally active compounds, the socalled synthetic pyrethroids , have exceptionally good insecticidal properties whilst possessing a very low mammalian toxicity, see British patent specifications 1,413,491 and 1,446,304. This combination of properties makes them of considerable interest to the agrochemical industry and much effort has been expended in determining economic routes to these synthetic pyrethroids , especially to the manufacture of substituted cyclopropanecarboxylic acids which represent the portion of the pyrethroid compound having no established synthetic routes available in the literature. In a search for economic routes to the substituted cyclopropanecarboxylic acids the Applicant has successfully managed to synthesize the substituted cyclopropanecarbonitrile but hitherto has been unable . 1 convert satisfactorily the nitrile into the corresponding acid or ester. The Applicant has attempted alcoholysis in the presence of an acid catalyst according to the many recommendations in standard text books but found that the yields of the corresponding alkyl ester were very poor and that the reactions often resulted in the production of large quantities of lactones and other by products. It is also known to convert nitriles into esters by means of the Pinner Reaction see Houben Weyl Handbuch derOrganischen Chemie , H. Heneka, Book 8, pages 536 539 1952 and Chemical Reviews , Robert Roger and Douglas Neilson, pages 181 184 1961 , involving the action of an alkanol and hydrogen bromide or hydrogen chloride on a nit rile at ambient temperature or lower temperatures under anhydrous conditions and hydrolyzing the resulting water sensitive iminoether. In the case of cyclopropanecarbonitriles, however, thePinner Reaction conditions had no effect even after a period of 24 hours. Surprisingly, the Applicant has now found that replacement of the alkanol by two specific alkoxyalkanols and a modification of the Pinner conditions has resulted in a very high conversion of a substituted cyclopropanecarbonitrile into the alkoxyalkyl ester of the corresponding substituted cyclopropanecarboxylic acid. The present invention, therefore, provides a process for the manufacture of an ester having the following general formula EMI2.1 wherein each of R1 and R independently represents an alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms or R1 and R2 together represent an alkylene group of up to 5 carbon atoms, each of X1 and X2 independently represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, a halogen atom, or X1 and X together represent an alkylene group of up to 5 carbon atoms, or X1 represents a hydrogen atom and Xê a 2 halovinyl group, a 2,2 dihalovinyl group or a 2 methyl 1 propenyl group, andR represents a 2 methoxyethyl or a 2 ethoxyethyl group , which process comprises reacting a substituted cyclopropanecarbonitrile having the general formula EMI3.1 wherein RÚ , Rê , XÚ and Xê have the same meaning as in formula I, with 2 methoxyethanol or 2 ethoxyethanol under substantially anhydrous conditions and in the presence of mineral acid acting as reaction catalyst and as scavenger for ammonia produced during the reaction. Preferably, the reaction temperature in the process according to the invention is maintained in the range 80 to 2000C and particularly in the range 100 to 1500C. The reaction conditions employed allow the use of atmospheric pressure. The mineral acid is preferably concentrated sulphuric acid as this gives rise to better yields of the ester of formula I. It has been found necessary to employ substantially anhydrous conditions, that is to say, conditions under which the amount of water present during the reaction is kept to a minimum for example, below about 5 by weight of the reaction mixture, preferably below 1 and suitably below 0.5 by weight of the reaction mixture. For example, the reaction will tolerate the water normally present in concentrated sulphuric acid 2 by weight at the concentrations of acid employed in the process, provided that the alcohol and the nitrile reactants are substantially dry. As the reaction proceeds under the influence of the mineral acid catalyst, ammonia is generated thereby neutralizing the acid catalyst, and thus sufficient quantities of the acid must be present in order to provide the necessary catalytic action. In general terms, the amount of mineral acid based on the nitrile present in the process according to the invention should lie in the range of from 3 1 to 1 1 by weight. In the compounds of general formula II, RÚ and Rê prefer 1 present methyl groups XÚ and 2 ably represent methyl groups X and X represent chlorine or bromine atoms or methyl groups or XÚ represents a hydrogen atom and Xê a 2,2 dichlorovinyl group, a 2,2 dibromovinyl group, a 2,2 difluorovinyl group, a 2 chloro 2 fluorovinyl group, or a 2 methyl 1 propenyl group and R represents a 2 methoxyethyl group. As has been stated hereinbefore, the alcoholysis reaction enables a cyclopropanecarbonitrile to be converted into the corresponding 2 methoxyethyl or 2 ethoxyethyl ester.Simultaneously, some 3,6 dioxaheptyl when methoxyethanol has been used or 3,6 dioxaoctyl when ethoxyethanol has been used ester of the corresponding substituted cyclopropanecarboxylic acid is formed these esters are novel compounds , together with a very small amount of an unidentified ester of the corresponding substituted cyclopropanecarboxyli c acid. The selectivity to the 2 methoxyethyl ester or the 2 ethoxyethyl ester is usually higher than 80 and the total of the selectivities to the three esters formed is usually higher than 95 . The expression selectivity to a certain compound , given in a percentage, is defined as a 100, b x 100, wherein a is the amount of the starting nitrile converted into that certain compound and b is the amount of the converted starting nitrile. The ester of formula I may be isolated from the reaction mixture obtained by addition of water, extraction of the product obtained with an organic solvent, washing of the organic extract phase with alkaline reacting water and evaporation of the solvent from the washed organic phase. The residue thus obtained also contains the 3,6 dioxaheptyl ester or the 3,6dioxaoctyl ester, the unidentified ester mentioned hereinbefore and 2,5,8 trioxanonane the ether derived from methoxyethanol or 3,6,9 trioxaundecane the ether derived from ethoxyethanol .The three esters present in the residue may then be converted to a synthetic pyrethroid via the free acid or the acid chloride by reaction with 3 phenoxybenzyl alcohol or alphacyano 3 phenoxybenzyl alcohol. The following nitriles are the most important in that they are intermediates for the pyrethroids of greatest pesticidal activity 2,2,3,3 tetramethylcyclopropanecarbonitrile 2,2 dimethyl 3 2 methyl 1 propenyl cyclopropane carbonitrile 3 2, 2 dichlorovinyl 2,2 dimethylcyclopropane carbonitrile 3 2, 2 dibromovinyl 2, 2 dimethylcyclopropane carbonitrile. The novel esters of substituted cyclopropanecarboxylic acids referred to hereinbefore are esters of the general formula EMI5.1 wherein each of R1 and R independently represents an alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms or R1 and R2 together represent an alkylene group of up to 5 carbon atoms, each of X1 and X2 independently represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, a halogen atom, or XÚ and Xê together represent an alkylene group of up to 5 carbon atoms, or X1 represents a hydrogen atom and Xê a 2 halovinyl group, a 2,2 dihalovinyl group or a 2 methyl 1 propenyl group andR represents a 2 methoxyethyl or a 2 ethoxyethyl group. 2 Methoxyethyl 3 2,2 dichlorovinyl 2,2 dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate is the preferred ester.
