## Description
CONCENTRIC MULTI RANGE GEAR TRAIN FOR TRANSMISSIONS The invention is a multi range synchronous shifting gear train package and specific gear train elements therefor for hydromechanical transmissions comprising a plurality of planetary gear sets wherein the planetary gear sets, the inputs and the outputs are concentric about a single axis and wherein the combination of the gear train package with an aligned infinitely variable component and mechanical input forms an all concentric, synchronous shifting, multi range hydromechanical transmission having a distinct reverse and three forward hydromechanical ranges. The invention also has utility when combined with a steer over device and with right and left final drive devices to form a steering transmission. There have been prior disclosures of concentric gear train hydromechanical transmissions or gear trains for such transmissions which have less than three forward ranges. These include the United States patents of Cockrell, 3,489,036, which is an all concentric, synchronous shifting truck transmission waving a hydromechanical low reverse range and a hydromechanical high range. The transmission of Mooney et al, U.S. Patent No.3,777,593, most closely approaches the result obtained by the subject gear train and transmissions in that it contains an all concentric, synchronous shifting, multi range truck transmission providing a hydrostatic low and two additional higher forward hydromechanical ranges wherein reverse gear is a part of the low range. This concentric transmission is, therefore, a three range transmission having one hydrostatic and two hydromechanical ranges based on two adjacent concentric planetary sets wherein one input is placed on both suns, one carrier is the output and is tied to the other ring.This is a fairly common combination of planetary sets Simpson gear train but money by reversing the normal order of the two sets, inserting the second input by means of an axial shaft to the far side of the planetaries and using a drum to connect the inside planetary to output has obtained a very compact three range transmission that is concentric. However, Mooney s transmission is limited in flexibility and in range of torque output. The maximum torque used by Mooney is a sun to ring reduction from the hydrostatic input and it appears that the arrangement precludes a sun to carrier reduction.Speed is also limited as third gear is restricted to a range having the same slope as first reverse and the total speed variation of first and reverse combined requires a trade off between first range torque and total transmission speed range in a situation in which the total forward range of speed is already limited by use of one half of the range of the hydraulic motor in the first range for reverse. There is no possibility of adding additional ranges as all available combinations of the two inputs with the four elements òf the two planetaries not connected to output have been used. The present invention overcomes these limitations and provides an additional forward gear range. In the accompanying drawings FIGURE 1 is a schematic illustration of a single output hydromechanical transmission according to the invention. FIGURE 2 is an illustration of an alternative implementation of the component illustrated as gear set 2 inFIGURE 1. FIGURE 3 is a graphic display of the relationship of the capacity of a variable displacement unit A, and the resulting speed in a constant displacement unit B of an infinitely variable component, to the synchronous shift points and output and input speeds. FIGURE 4 is a block diagram showing the application of the concentric gear train package of FIGURE 1 to a novel steering transmission. FIGURE 5 is a schematic illustration of a hydromechanical steering transmission incorporating the concentric gear train package of FIGURE 1 according to the block diagram of FIGURE 4. FIGURE 6 is a schematic illustration of a single output hydromechanical transmission substantially identical to that of FIGURE 1 but wherein there is a different interconnection between the B unit 14 of the infinitely variable component and the gear train package 7. FIGURE 7 is a schematic illustration of a part ofFIGURE 6 wherein some of the elements forming the interconnection between the B unit of the infinitely variable component and the gearbox are shown in elevation. The drawings illustrate the novel gear train by use of a commonly accepted schematic system referred to as stick drawings wherein the con act between intermeshing gears is shown by two spaced parallel lines and wherein a bearing or journaled support of a gear is shown by a pair of parallel lines, one on each side of the shaft or spindle on which the gear is journaled. A preferred embodiment of the invention in its most simple form of application to a transmission is illustrated in FIGURE 1 of the drawings. It is an all concentric infinitely variable multi range synchronous shifting hydromechanical transmission requiring just four plane tary gear sets for a transmission having an independent reverse and plural forward ranges i.e., three or more distinct ranges . The transmission illustrated is concentric about the axis of input shaft 10, gear train package shaft 20, and output shaft 30 and is made up of an infinitely variable component 1, four planetary gear sets 2, 3, 4 and 5, and additional range clutches 6.The planetaries and clutches with shaft 20 constitute a novel multi range concentric gear train package 7 which has utility in combinction with the hydraulic component 1 as shown to constitute a heavy duty truck transmission as well as in other combinations. As a truck transmission, the input shaft 10 is attached to the vehicle power plant and the output shaft 30 to a drive shaft to provide power to driving wheels as, for example, through a differential.The infinitely variable component 1 is illustrated as a hydraulic component having a variable capacity. positive displacement hydraulic pump A unit 12 which drives a positive displacement hydraulic motor B unit 14 , to drive an output 16 as the result of attachment of pump 12 to the input shaft 10 which is driven by an engine. The hydraulic motor 14 may have either a fixed or a variable capacity. All of pump 12, motor 14 and hydrostatic output drum 16 rotate about the axis of shaft 10. Although the system as contemplated in the invention preferably uses radial ball piston units for A and B , other hydraulic infinitely variable components may be employed. Planetary gear set 2, which is driven both by shaft 10, which is mechanically driven by the power plant, and by output 16 of the hydrostatic unit, can be regarded as a mixer set because it has as one of its functions the production of a hydromechaical output as a result of mixing the mechanical output of shaft 10 and the hydrostatic output of 16. Planetary set 2 is a compound planetary set which serves to produce multiple inputs to various elements including shaft 20, hollow shaft 24 and drum 26 which rotate concentrically with each other about the axis of shaft 20. These elements 20,24, 26 are sometimes referred to below respectively as first, second, and third intermediate output shafts. The operation of planetary gear set 2 is as follows.Carrier C2 of set 2 is driven as a result of the action on planetary geas P2 of the rotation of sun gear S2 driven mechanically by shaft 10 and the rotation of ring gear R2 driven hydrostatically by motor B through drum 16.Carrier C2 not only drives central shaft 20 and drum shaft 26, but also permits the use of a second set of planetary gears P2a which exactly reproduce the actions of the primary planetary gears P2 of the set 2. This arrangement causes the second set of planetary gears P to drive sun gear S2a to produce on sun gear S2a a movement which is proportional or identical to the movement of sun gear S2. Therefore, hollow shaft 24 rotates at a speed which is proportional or identical to hat of input shaft 10, depending on the relative sizes of sun gears S2 and S2a. A different pair of outputs of planetary set 2 can be obtained by rearranging the inputs as, for example, driving sun S2 hydrostaticaly and ring R2 mechanically. In another variation, the output of the infinitely variable component 1 can be conveyed to the compound planetary set 2 by means of a hollow shaft 60 as shown in FIGURES 6 and 7 to an extra set of planetary gears rather than ring gear R2 as shown in FIGURE 1 to permit more latitude in selection of gear ratios as will be explained more fully below with respect to the description of FIGURES 6 and 7. As apparent from the separate FIGURE 6 illustration, the concept illustrated in FIGURE 2 requires the passing of one motion, i.e., that of sun S2, through another motion, i.e., that of carrier C2. In its very fundamental form, this is the same as exchanging the motions of two concentric shafts from one to the other. FIGURE 2 illustrates a different implementation of the principle illustrated in gear set 2 of FIGURE 1. The FIGURE 2 implementation is in the form of the combination of separate gears within broken line 70 to exchange motions between two sets of two concentric shafts 73, 76 after the two inputs 1a and Ib are used to generate a new function.These gears 70 include a compound planetary set 72 concentric with and interconnecting two sets of concentric shafts 73, 74 and 75, 76, all of which rotate about the axis defined by axial shafts 73 and 75. The compound planetary set 72, which has no ring gears, is made up of a planetary carrierC72 which carries dual sets of planetaries P72 and P72a, each pair of which are keyed together by a shaft 77 journaled in a bearing in the carrier C72. The planetaries are meshed with sun gears S72 and 572a to drive sun 72a responsive to sun 72. By this arrangement, the rotational motion of axial shaft 73 on the input side is passed through hollow shaft 74 to be applied to hollow shaft 76 while the motion of 74 is transferred to axial shaft 75. When combined with planetary set 82, the arrangement shown in FIGURE 2 performs the same function as the compound planetary set 2 of FIGURE 1. Comparison of FIGURE 2 with planetary set 2 of FIGURE 1 indicates that the outputs 75, 76, 78 differ only in the location of outputs. InFIGURE 2 the inner and outer shafts 20, 26 carry the same output and the intermediate shaft 24 carries a second output whereas in FIGURE 2, two exterior shafts 76 and 78 carry one output and a proximate shaft 75 carries the other. Gear set 70, therefore, when added to planetary set 82 provides for the relocation of the functions produced by set 82. This gear combination, in addition to solving a problem inherent in multirange concentric gearboxes as contemplated by this invention, has application to and utility in other gear trains. Referring again to FIGURE 1, the gear train package 7 is made up of four planetary gear sets 2, 3, 4 and 5 and additional range clutches 6 wherein planetary sets 3, 4 and 5 provide for the combining of the mechanical input from shaft 10 and shaft 24 and the hydromechanical output of planetary set 2 in different distinct ratios to provide different speed ranges. The first and lowest range is derived in this configuration by use of the planetary gear set 3 wherein the ring gear R3 of that set is provided with a brake I.Application of that brake causes planetary set 3 to drive the output shaft 30 from the basic hydromechanical output of p anetary set 2 on shaft 20 with a sun to carrier speed reduction as determined by the ratio of the gears S3, P3, R3 of set 3. Planetary set 4 has a dual function.With brake R, and only brake R applied, carrier C4 is stationary, holding the centers of the shafts of planet gears P4 so that ring gear R4 is driven by shaft 20 through sun gear S4 and planet gears P4. Pving gear R4 drives carrier C3 and output shaft 30 directly. The addition of one element in the train over the number of elements used in the first range causes a reversal of direction and the use of sun to ring a different ratio than produced. in range I. Planetary set 5 provides a different combination of mechanical and hydrostatic inputs as set 5 with brake II applied causes planet gears P5 and carrier C5 to be drive mechanically by shaft 24 through sun gear S5 at a sun to carrier speed reduction. The connection between carriersC4 and C5 can also be described as a hollow shaft which with the interconnection with the attachment for clutchIV can be referred to as an additional range shaft 48.Rotation of carrier C4 causes ring gear R4 to be driven as a resultant of the inputs to both carrier C4 and sunS4 which resultant i a further mixing of the hydro mechanical output of carrier C2 furnished through sun 54 and the mechanical input from shaft 24 at the sun carrier reduction from set 5. Clutches III and IV provide for additional inp to cause carrier C5 to produce two further outputs as the basis for two additional ranges.Clutch III, when engaged, places on ring gear R5 the basic hydromechanical product of the mixer set 2 on shaft 26 so that carrier C5 will be driven as the resultant of a com ination of that input and the mechanical input from shaft 24 on sun S. Clutch IV locks planetary set 5 so that the output of carrier C5 is one to one with, or the same as, shaft 24 and sun S5 which is proportional to the mechanical input speed on shaft 10. The combination of planetaries 3 and 4 is similar to a component previously used in various gear arrangements including other transmissions, and usually referred to as a Simpson gear train. Use of the gear train package of the present invention as a component of a transmission can be Explained with reference to FIGURE 3. FIGURE 3, which is based on the use of a variable displacement hydraulic pump and a constant displacement hydraulic motor B, serves to illustrate one feasible implementation of the synchronous shifting transmission. In this implementation the hydraulic components and the gear train ratios are selected so that a negative stroke of 67 on the pump A with its resulting running of the hydraulic motor B in reverse at 67 of pump speed will cause ring gear R2 to run backwards at a speed which offsets the forward speed of sun gear S2 so that, although the planetaries P2 and P2a are spinning, carrier C2 stands still. This permits the engagement of either the first range brake I or the reverse brake R without causing final output shaft 30 to rotate, as both ranges are driven from the basic hydromechanical output of planetary set 2 on shaft 20. The 67 is illustrative only, as indicated by the fact that another implementation uses 95 as the zero output speed ratio to obtain a wider output speed range of the transmission in each gear range. The plotted ordinates of FIGURE 3 represent the A pump 12 stroke and the B motor 14 speed as a percent of full speed through the different speed ranges represented by the abscissa. Starting at the minus 67 speed, changing the stroke of the pump A to shift the capacity toward zero, while the first range brake I is applied, causes motor B , which is running backwards at 67 of pump speed, to slow down moving upward on the chart in range I causing carrier C2 of planetary set to begin to move in reaction to the two inputs to cause the output shaft 30 to accelerate in the forward direction. Continued stroking of the capacity of the pump A in the positive direction causes motor B to decelerate to a zero speed and to then accelerate in the forward direction until motor B is running in the forward direction at 100 of pump or input speed.At this point, the final output shaft 30 is running at the maximum first range speed which is an output powered hydromechanically from gear train package axial shaft 20 reduced through planetary set 3 by a sun S3 to carrier C3 reduction. In reverse range, the result is only slightly different than in range I in that the mixer planetary set 2 performs in the same way to produce an increasing hydromechanical speed on shaft 20 which is utilized by planetary set 4 rather than planetary set 3.With first range brake I inactivated and reverse range brake R activated so as to lock carrier C4 in position against rotation, the effect of driving sun gear S4 as shaft 20 increases in speed is to cause ring gear R4 to accelerate, driving carrier C3 of planetary set 3 in the direction opposite from that which it turned in range I, by reason of the intervening planetary P4, and at a different output ratio, as the sun S4 to ring R4 reduction differs from the sun S3 to carrier C3 reduction ratio of the planetary set 3. Higher speed ranges are provided through the additional combining of the hydromechanical output of carrierC2 of set 2 and the mechanical input on shaft 10 reproduced on intermediate shaft 24 by means of the action of the second range planetary set 5 in cooperation with planetary set 4. For example, application of the second range brake II along with the release of first range brake I at the maximum speed in first range locks ring gear R5 in a stationary position so that the effect of the mechanical input on shaft 24 and sun S5 causes carrierC5 to produce an output which is applied to carrier C4 of planetary set 4. The second range is intended to be made operational through the application of second range brake II relatively simultaneously with release of first range brake I at a point which corresponds to a maximum forward rotation of hydraulic motor B as shown inFIGURE 3.In the second range, carrier C4 starts at a speed which, when combined with the hydromechanical input furnished by sun S4, produces a speed in the ring Rd which is the same as the speed at which carrier C 3 was being driven at top speed in first range to cause a synchronous shift to second range. From there, the gearing is such that a deceleration of speed of the sun gear S4 as driven by shalt 20 causes ring gear R4 and carrier C3 and output shaft 30 to further accelerate in the forward direction until such time as the speed of hydraulic motor 1t311 in the negative direction reaches the design point 67 , as illustrated for range II in FIGURE 3. This is the maximum speed point in second range. A third range is obtained by driving the ring gearR5 of the second range planetary set 5 through clutch III from the hydromechanical intermediate output shaft 26 from carrier C2 of the mixer planetary set 2. At the indicated shift point of 67 of hydraulic motor B , carrier C2 and, therefore, drum shaft 26 are stationary so that third range clutch III can be engaged to provide a synchronous shift from second to third range with an accompanying release of second range brake II. From that shift point a stroking of pump A in the positive direction with the third range clutch engaged will cause motor B which is running backwards to begin to slow so that carrier C2 which had been stopped begins to accelerate causing carrier C5 to accelerate in the forward direction.The set 5 serves to further mix the mechanical input available at sun 5 with the basic hydromechanical output of set 2 applied to ring R5 to drive carrier C5 and consequently carrier C4 with that resultant. A further mixing of that resultant with the basic hydromechanical output from sun S4 which is also just beginning to accelerate causes ring gear R4 and consequently carrier C3 and final output shaft 30 to further increase in speed in the forward direction. The maximum speed in third range is attained, as illustrated in FIGURE 3, when hydraulic motor B is running forwardly at 100 speed, which is the speed of the mechanical input. A synchronous shift is then obtained by locking up planetary set 5 by means of fourth range clutch IV as carrier C5 at that point is running at the same speed as shaft 24. From then on carriers C5 and C4 run at constant speed proportional to the mechanical input on input shaft 10. De stroking of the capacity of pump A then causes hydraulic motor B , which was running at 100 forward speed, to decelerate causing carrier C2 and, consequently, shaft 20 to decelerate.This action, when operating against the constant mechanical speed of carrier C4, will cause a further acceleration in ring gear R4, carrier C3 and output shaft 30 in the fourth forward range. As indicated in the row of numbers on FIGURE 3 just above the Roman numerals indicating the ranges, the first to second range shift point occurs with the output shaft running at 20 of a direct drive speed.The other shift points and maximum fourth range speed are at the other ratios indicated with respect to the input speed. In the implementation described, as illustrated inFIGURE 3, the negative slopes of the A STROKE B SPEED lines are the same with the parallelism indicating an identity of gear ratio offset in output speed by some variable factor. The commonality of slope lines reflects the fact that each of the ranges R, II, and IV is primarily driven with the basic hydromechanical output of mixer set 2 from carrier C2 through the sun to ring reduction in planetary set 4 and, as shown in FIGURE 3, with a resulting output range speed of 25 of input speed. The displacement of these three ranges, reverse, second and fourth, depends on the condition placed on carrier C4. In reverse, C4 is locked.In second range,C4 is driven from carrier C5 by the mechanical input on S5 against a locked R5 at the sun carrier reduction which causes C4 to rotate at approximately one third of input speed. In fourth range, C4 is locked through C5 and clutch IV directly to hollow shaft 24 to turn at input spe . . Thus, the gear train can be described in terms of using a planetary gear set to obtain a sun to ring reduction of the basic hydromechanical output produced as a summation in a mixing element of input speed and the contribution of an infinitely variable device and using the carrier of that set to introduce different each relatively constant offset speeds each derived from the system input speed to produce multiple distinct ranges of output. Ranges produced in this fashion can be used as alternate ranges in a transmission and can constitute any number of such ranges for which separate offset differences can be obtained to introduce through the carrier. The multi range concentric gear train package, as identified at 7 in FIGURE. 1, including the four planetaries and the additional range clutches can be used as an entity in combinations to form other transmissions as, for example, that illustrated in block diagram inFIGURE 4. The block in FIGURE 4 identified as the concentric multi range gear package 7 comprises those same elements identified as 2 through 6 in FIGURE 1 or their equivalents and demonstrates how the gear package can be used as the nucleus of a different transmission which, in the case illustrated, is a steering transmission for track laying vehicles or for multiple axle all wheel drive wheeled vehicles.In this implementation, the propulsion hydraulics 11, which is the same component as the infinitely variable component 1 of FIGURE 1, is physically separated from the gear package 7 and connected thereto by means of transfer gears 18. This permits driving both the propulsion hydraulics 11 and a steer unit 19 from a common input 8 and a power shaft 9.In this implementation, the output of the gear package 7, as indicated at 40 and 41, provides power to separately located output planet sets 50 and 51 to permit operation of the steerinc system as a part of the final drive of the vehicle. The steering unit 19 is connected to the output planet set 51 as indicated at 35, and by the steering interconnection 45 to output planet 50, to cause a speed differential between the two output planet sets to accomplish the steering. A steering differential input speed is provided to output planet set 51 with an equal and opposite steering input to output planet set 50.Although FIGURE 4 generally illustrates that the concentric gear package can be used in various combina tions with other components to form different transmissions, FIGURE 5 shows a specific implementation of a transmission corresponding to that shown in the block diagrams in FIGURE 4. FIGURE 5 is a schematic illustration of a hydromechanical steering transmission according to the block diagram of FIGURE 4 which includes a modified implementation of the concentric gear train package 7 of FIGURE 1 as indicated by the broken line box 71. The transmission, in addition to the gear train package 71, has an input shaft 8 which is connected to a power shaft 9 by means of a full reversing differential device 29 which includes two clutches, one for forward and one for reverse mction. Power shaft 9 drives both an infinitely variable component 11 which, in this implementation, is the same hydrostatic positive displacement device including a variable capacity pump wA t and a fixed capacity motor B as the component 1 portion of the transmission illustrated in FIGURE 1, Hydrostatic drive is provided to the gear train package 71 by means of gear 17 and transfer gears 37 to provide speed and torque to ring gear R22 which will be described in conjunction with description of the concentric gear package 71. Mechanical power from the input through power shaft 9 is also applied to the gear train package 71 by transfer gears 38 to provide mechanical drive to hollow shaft 39 to drive sun gear S22. The concentric multi range gear train package as illustrated in the block 71 of FIGURE 5 is modified from the package 7 of FIGURE 1 in two respects. In view of the use of the full reversing device 29 using two clutches, package 71 does not require or include a reverse brake. There is also a slight relocation of certain components resulting from the fact that in a steering transmission it is impossible to insert either the mechanical or the variable drive along the centerline of the concentric gear package without using an offset train for the output. In package 71, the planetary sets 22, 33, 44 and 55 are comparable to and serve the same functions as the planetary sets 2, 3, 4 and 5 of package 7 in FIGURE 1 except for the fact that there is no provision for locking carrier C44 against rotation to provide a distinct reverse range.Mechanical drive is inserted by means of hollow shaft 39 which drives the sun gear S22 of set 22 in the same way that input shaft 10 drives sun gear S2 in FIGURE 1.Hydrostatic drive is inserted by means of gear ring gearR22 of planetary set 2 comparably to the way drum 16 drives ring gear R2 in the FIGURE 1. Also comparably to the implementations illustrated in FIGURES 6 and 7, the infinitely variable hydrostatic drive could be inserted by an extra set of planetary gears mounted on the carrier C22 as a substitution for ring gear R22. The extra set of planetary gears not illustrated would be on the same side of C22 as are P22, would intermesh with P22 and would be driven either by a ring gear not illustrated similar to R22 or by a separate pinion. The output of gear package 71 is provided by means of drum shafts 40 and 41 which are interconnected by axially located drive shaft 31 to accommodate the requirements of a steering transmission having a steer over device such that the transmission output is supplied to final drive planetaries to permit application of a differential speed for steering. In this implementation, 50 and 51 are the final drive planetaries and the drums 40 and 41 supply power to the ring gears 42 and 43 of the planetaries. From the ring gears 42 and 43, power is supplied to final drive axles 52 and 53 by means of the planetary gears and carriers 56 and 57 of the output planet sets. A differential speed is applied to sun gears 58 and 59 of the output planetary sets by means of transfer gears 54 and steering interconnection shaft 45.The steering differential speed is derived from steer unit 19 which is driven by power shaft 9 and which constitutes an infinitely variable device which can be implemented as a hydrostatic unit including a variable capacity positive displacement hydraulic pump unit C and constant capacity positive displacement hydraulic motor unit D similar to the A and B units used for propulsion. By means of steer unit 19, transfer gears 54, steering unit interconnection shaft 45, and idler gears 46 and 47, a rotation in either direction can be imparted to output planet set sun gear 59 with a corresponding motion in the opposite direction simultaneously applied to sun gear 58 of output planetary 50. In this way, final drive axles 52 and 53 are driven by means of gear package 71 while a differential speed for steering is imparted by the mechanisms just described. In gear package 71, the final output shaft 31 is driven by ring gear R44. Ring gear R44 is attached directly to drum shaft 40, and through shaft 31 to drum shaft 41 to drive the ring gears 42 and 43 of the output planetary sets. FIGURES 6 and 7 illustrate a variation on the hydromechanical transmission illustrated in FIGURE 1 in which the output of the infinitely variable component 1 is transmitted from the 3fl unit 14 to the compound planetary gear set 2 by means of a hollow shaft 60 which drives an additional sun gear Sg to drive a planet gear P8 to drive planet gear P2 rather than by means of the hollow shaft 16 which drives ring gear R2. This variation is described and illustrated principally to avoid any inference that the transmissions in either the single output form as shown inFIGURES 1 and 6, or in the steering transmission form shown in FIGURE 5, is limited to the gear ratios normally attainable by using a planetary set in which the inputs are put on sun and ring to produce an output on the carrier.Because there is a practical limitation on the tooth count ratios among ring, planetary and sun gears resulting from the fact that it is not feasible to use either planetary or sun gears smaller than a.particular size in comparison to the other two gears of a set, it is common practice in the art to limit a planetary set to be used for ring and sun inputs to produce a carrier output to a range between 80 20 and 60 40 ratios wherein the first number represents ring and the second number, the sun . Other ratios can be obtained by using a compound planetary set as shown in FIGURES 6 and 7 in lieu of a ring gear for one of the two inputs to the set. This compound planetary arrangement will permit, for example, a 50 50 ratio or other ratios outside of the 80 20 60 40 practical limitations. The actual arrangement of gears Eg, Pc, and P2 ofFIGURE 6 is better illustrated in FIGURE 7 where, for the purpose of this explanation one planetary gear of each of the planetary sets at P8, P2, P2a is show. in elevation along with a portion of the sun gear Sg, 52 and S2a with which they mesh. As previously explained with respect to the FIGURE 1 configuration, sun gear S2 meshes with and drives planetary gears P2 which are keyed to planetariesP2a by means of shafts 67 journalled in carrier 62 so that the rotation of 2a duplicates that of P2 about shaft 67.By meshing the additional planetaries P8 between the sun S9 and planet gear P2, the additional input derived from the infinitely variable component is placed on planetaries P2 with the same effect as obtained in the ring gear version of FIGURE 1 so as to cause planetaries P2 not only to rotate about their own axes but to progress about the axis dictated by the carrier C2 thereby driving carrier C2 and the attached shafts 20 and 26. The planetaries P8 are also attached to the carrier C2 by means of shafts 68 the attachments of which are omitted from the illustration so that they do not obscure other elements to which they are journalled for free rotation. The shafts 68 connecting planetaries P8 to the carrier C2 are parallel to, but spaced from, shafts 67. In the above description of the embodiment of FIGURE 1, it is stated that the second intermediate output hollow shaft 24 rotates at a speed which is proportional or identical to that of input shaft 10. Since an identical speed is also a proportional speed in the proportion 1 to 1 the term proportional speed as used below is intended to include an identical speed.
