## Description
Phenyl piperazine derivatives having antiagressive activity The invention relates to new phenyl piperazine derivatives, to the preparation of these compounds, and to compositions comprising at least one of these compounds as an active substance. Various phenyl piperazine derivatives having a variety of pharmacological properties are known. United States Patent Specification 2,722,529, for example, relates to compounds of formula 1 of the formula sheet, in which B is a straight or branched alkyl group having 2 6 carbon atoms and 0 is an acyl group, sulphonyl group or carbamoyl groups These compounds are said to have a strong sympatholytic activity and sometimes a hypotensive activity. From United States Patent Specification 2,833, 770 is furthermore known a group of compounds of the general formula 2 of the formula sheet, in which formula R is a chlorine atom or a bromine atom, R is hydrogen or a methyl group and m is an integer number from 2 5. Of these compounds a sympatholytic activity is also known. It has been found that phenyl piperazine derivatives of formula 3 of the formula sheet, in which R1 is a hydrogen atom, a methyl group or a substituted or non substituted phenyl group, R2 is a hydrogen atom or a methyl group, or R1 and R2 together with the carbon atom to which they are bound are a cyclic alkyl group having 3 7 C atoms,R3 is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 1 or 2 carbon atoms, R4 is a trifluoromethyl group, A is a straight or branched alkyl group having 1 4 C atoms, and Z is a cycloalkyl group having 5 7 C atoms, a phenyl group or a phenyl group substituted by 1, 2 or 3 substituents selected from the group consisting of alkyl, alkoxy, halogen and CF3, a furanyl group, a pyridyl group or a pyrimidyl group, an optionally substituted benzyl, aryloxy, arylthio, arylsulfonyl, arylsulfinyl or heteroaryloxy group and the salts thereof have a strong antiagressive activity. Some of the compounds belonging to this group moreover have some analgetic activity. Surprisingly, this antiagressive activity of the compounds according to the invention proved not to be associated with the sympatholytic properties described for the above mentioned known and structurally closely related compounds, which properties are undesired for antiagressive agents. Other undesired side effects, such as dopaminolytic, muscle relaxing and sedative properties which are undesired for use as antiagressive agents are also absent in the dosages in which the antiagressive activity occurs It is extremely surprising that the compounds according to the invention show a strong and particularly selective antiagressive activity, since structurally very closely related known compounds have a quite different pharmacological activity pattern. The activity of the compounds ED50 value was determined in a test on antiagressive activity in isolated mice Advances in Pharmacol. 5, 1967 , 79 . In this test, male albino mice were kept isolated for a period of 4 weeks and then selected for the test on the basis of fighting behaviour present The selection criterion is the occurrence of 3 or more fighting periods within 3 minutes after a mouse not kept isolated was placed in the cage of the mouse which had been kept isolated. The compounds to be examined were administered orally to the selected mice. Per dose 5 mice were used. Sixty minutes after administration of the compounds to be tested, the animals were again evaluated for fighting behaviour. The compound to be examined is inactive in the dose administered when this time also 3 or more fighting periods were observed within 3 minutes after a mouse not kept isolated was placed in the case of the mouse which had been kept isolated. From the results obtained the ED50 value in mg of active substance per kg of body weight was calculated. The ED50 values of the 50 compounds according to the invention is smaller than 10 mg kg and in most of the cases is between 1 and 5 mg kg. Since in the compounds according to the invention the sympatholytic activity and also other undesired side effects mentioned of the known compounds were in addition not found, the new compounds are excellently suitable, due to their surprising selective antiagressive activity pattern, for being used in the treatment of intrapunitive and extrapunitive behaviour and overt agressive behaviour in man and animal. For medical use in men is to be considered first of all the control of agressive symptoms in psychiatric illnesses and serious forms of psychopathological agression. As an application possibility in the veterinary field are to be considered in particular those forms of agression which occur in transporting agricultural domestic animals and the mixing of groups of these animals. The quantity, frequency and way of administration may differ for each individual case also dependent on the nature and the severity of the disturbances. In general a dose of 5 500 mg and preferably 25 150 mg per day will be suitable for humane application. For veterinary purposes the dose is preferably 0.1 10 mg kg of body weight. The active compounds according to the invention and their salts can be processed to compositions such as pills, tablets, coated tablets, capsules, powders, injection liquids and the like according to known standard techniques, while using the conventional auxiliary substances such as solid and liquid carrier materials. As examples of pharmaceutically acceptable acids with which the compounds according to the invention can form salts may be mentioned hydrzhloric acid, sulphuric acid, nitric acid, citric acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, tartaric acid, methanesulfonic acid, benzoic acid and the like. The compounds of formula 3 and their salts can be prepared according to methods suitable for the synthesis of analogous compounds. The invention therefore also relates to the preparation of the new compounds and the salts thereof. Dependent on the symbols of R1 R4, A and Z, the compounds of the general formula 3 can be obtained accor ding to at least one of the methods below a Reaction of a compound of formula 4, in which R3, R4 and A have the above mentioned meanings, with an ester prefer ably the methyl ester of ethyl ester of a compound of formula 5, in which R1, R2 and Z have the above mentioned meanings. The reaction is preferably carried out with an excess of the ester, in a suitable solvent, at a temperature between room temperature and the boiling point of the solvent used see J. Pharm. Soc. Japan, 62 1942 , 531 .b Reaction of a compound of formula 4 with an acid halide of formula 6 or the mixed anhydride of formula 7, or with the ester of formula 8 so called Mukayama ester see Chem. Letters, 1163 , 1975 . This reaction is carried out in an organic solvent, for example, toluene, dioxan, ether, methylene chloride or tetrahydrofuran, at temperatures between room temperature and the boiling point of the solvent used. The compounds according to the invention can also be obtained by reaction of a compound of formula 9 with a compound of formula 10. In these formulae, R1 R4, A and Z have the above mentioned meanings and X is a so called leaving group, preferably chlorine, bromine or tosylate. The reaction may be carried out both with and without an inert organic solvent. Suitable solvents are, for example, methyl ethyl ketone, dimethyl formamide, tetrahydrofuran, petroleum ether, alcohol and acetonitrile. As an acid binder is preferably used NaHC03 or potassium carbonate. The reaction temperature is. usually between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvent used, and the reaction duration varies from a few hours to approximately 20 hours. Compounds according to the invention of formula 3, in which R3 is an alkyl group and R1, R2, Rq, A and Z have the above mentioned meanings, may also be prepared by reaction of a compound of formula 3 not substituted at the nitrogen atom with a compound R3Y, in which R3 is alkyl andY is halogen preferably iodine or S04 i. This reaction is usually carried out in a solvent , for example, benzene, DMSO or dimethyl formamide in the presence of a strong base such as, for example, KOH orNaH in anhydrous circumstances at temperatures between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvent seeJ. Org. Chem. 14 1949 , 1099 . In similar reaction circumstances, compounds of formula 3 can be prepared by reaction of a compound of formula 11 with a compound of formula 12, in which formulae R1 R4, A, Z and X have the above mentioned meanings. Compounds according to the invention of formula 3, in which R4 is trifluoromethyl, can be obtained by reaction of a compound of formula 13, in which R4 is trifluoromethyl and Hal is halogen, preferably bromine, with a compound of formula 14, in which R1 R3, A and Z have the above mentioned meanings. This reaction is carried out in a solvent, for example, DMSO, in the presence of an acid binder, for example Na2CO3. The reaction mixture is stirred at elevated tempera 0 ture 100 180 C for a few hours see German Offenlegungs schrift 2,024,826 . The compounds of formula 3 can furthermore be prepared by converting a compound of formula 15, in which R1 R4, A and Z have the above mentioned meanings, with 1,2 dibromoethane. The reaction is carried out in an organic solvent such as dioxan or butanol in the presence of an id binder, for example, K2CO3, at a temperature of 20 1200C see Arzneimittel Chemie 27 11 , 1977 , 2077 2086 . The compounds of formula 3 can also be obtained by converting a compound of formula 16 with a compound of for mula 17, in which formulae R1 R44and Z have the above mentioned meanings. This conversion is preferably carried out in a solvent, for example butanol, in the presence of an acid binder, for example K2C03, at temperatures between room temperature and the boiling point of the solvent used see British PatentSpecification 943,739 . Furthermore, the compounds of formula 3 can be prepared in similar reaction circumstances by reaction of a compound of formula 18 with a compound of formula 19, in which formula R1 R4, A and Z have the above mentioned meanings see Coll. Czech. Chem. Comm. 6 1934 , 211 . Compounds of the general formula 3 in which A is the group CEl2 CH2 , can be prepared by converting a compound of formula 9 with a compound of formula 20, in which formula R1 R4 and Z have the above mentioned meanings, The 0 two reaction components are heated at 100 C for 1 6 hours pre ferably without a solvent. However, the starting substances can also be reacted in a solvent such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone or toluene at temperatures between room temperature and the boiling point of the solvent used. The compounds of the general formula 3, in which R R and Z have the above mentioned meanings and A is the methylene group, can also be obtained by reacting a compound of formula 9 with a compound of formula 12 in the presence of a formaline solution in alcohol, at temperatures between room temperature and the boiling point of the solvent. The invention will now be described in greater detail with reference to the ensuing specific examples.
