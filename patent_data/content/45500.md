# Method for pretreatment of cellulose materials.

## Abstract
The disclosure is concerned with a pretreatment process for removing lignin from lignocellulose material so as to enhancing enzymatic or microbial decomposability of cellu lose. The pretreatment process comprises wetting lignocel lulose material with an alkaline aqueous solution 6 in a manner that interstices between the cellulose material remain, and exposing the wetted cellulose material to an ozone containing gas 1 so as to decompose lignin in the lignocellulose material with a very small energy consump tion.
