# Information signal reproducing apparatus.

## Abstract
The device includes a magnetic head 7 for reproducing the video signal recorded in slant tracks on a magnetic tape T , a transport mechanism 9, 12, 12a for driving the tape at a controllably varied speed, and a tracking control circuit 3 for supplying tracking control signals to the magnetic head whereby the head tracks the recorded video signal. The device further includes a system control circuit 8 for controlling the transport mechanism to drive the tape at a selected playback speed, and a display 13h connected to the system control circuit for indicating a relationship between the predetermined duration and a duration of the reproduced video signal as played back with the tape driven at the selected playback speed.
