# Method of centrifugal casting.

## Abstract
A method of centrifugal casting comprises the steps of forming moulding material in a flask 41 around a pattern 35 made of decomposable material removing the decom posable material pattern 35 whereby the moulding material provides a mould 42 , spinning the mould about an axis A , introducing into the mould molten metal, continuing to spin the mould whilst permitting the metal to solidify to thus produce a casting, removing the casting from the moulding material.
