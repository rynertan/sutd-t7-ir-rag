# INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE

## Abstract
The invention relates to an internal combustion engine in which an auxilary chamber 22 is provided communicating with the combustion chamber 12. A valve 20 is arranged to open and close in such a manner as to isolate the auxiliary chamber 22 from the combustion chamber 12 during the compression period of the piston 10 and remove a variable fraction of the charge from the combustion process in order to vary the effective compression ratio and the air usage of the engine.
