# Pneumatic pipeline transport system.

## Abstract
A pneumatic pipeline transportation system for solid, containerized cargo. Cargo carrying vehicles 11, 13, 15, 17, 19 are propelled within a hollow guideway 10 adapted to hold movable vehicles 11, 13, 15, 17, 19 of substantially similar cross section. Kinetic energy is applied to the vehicle intermittently, causing the vehicle to set a trapped column of air 14, 16 in the guideway 10 in motion. The air column 14, 16 acts on adjacent vehicles, and in combination with the applied force, propels the vehicles through the guideway 10 .
