# Improvements in and relating to gasket manufacture.

## Abstract
A flat gasket incorporating a metallic reinforcement layer which is enclosed within the gasket in relation to one edge thereof is formed from relatively uncompacted, i.e. loose, expanded graphite particles by a method comprising the step of pressing such particles onto the opposed faces of said reinforcement substantially simultaneously to form compacted graphite foils in situ thereon whilst at the same time pressing some of said particles relative to said one edge to form a single unreinforced graphite foil portion extending from and integral with the other foils to enclose said one edge.
