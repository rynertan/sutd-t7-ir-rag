# Improvements in and relating to epicyclic assemblies.

## Abstract
A planetary gear consists of a ring shaped planetary gear ring and two planetary discs supporting the planetary gear ring. The planetary disc has an outer bigger disc part and an inner smaller disc part. The inner smaller disc part 18 supports the inner surface of the planetary gear ring. The outer bigger disc part is bigger than the tooth edge circle of the planetary gear. Planetary shafts piercing planetary shaft holes of the planetary discs are fixed by a carrier at both ends. An outer inner toothed gear has an outer ring gear part and two outer inner cylindrical parts. The outer inner cylindrical part is wider than the tooth root circle of the outer inner toothed gear. A sun gear hasasun gear part and two sun gear convex boss parts. The outer surface of the sun gear convex boss part is smaller than the tooth root circle of the sun gear. The outer surfaces of the outer bigger disc parts of the planetary discs roll on the outer surtaces of the sun gear convex parts as well as on the inner surfaces of the outer inner cylindrical parts.
