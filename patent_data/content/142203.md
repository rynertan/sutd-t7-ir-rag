# Method of pressing an article of a thermoplastic material and apparatus for manufacturing an article of a thermoplastic material by pressing.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method and apparatus for pressforming an article of a thermoplastic material. In accor dance with the method a charge of molten material is depo sited in a mould 14 and the central axis of a pressing plunger 18 and the mould 14 are aligned, after high a pressing operation is performed, the alignment being interrupted just before the end of the pressing operation. The apparatus com prises a frame 2 , a mould 14 and a plunger 18 , which plunger 18 is connected to a guide mechanism 22 which is movably connected to the frame 2 and which can be coupled rigidly to the mould 14 by coupling means 52 .
