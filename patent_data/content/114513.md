# Vehicle electronic control method and mechanism.

## Abstract
In a method of electronically controlling a vehicle when a transmission is shifted into the reverse gear position, a clutch is disengaged followed by switching the transmission to a neutral position. With the clutch in the disengaged state, the transmission is then temporarily switched to a gear position having a synchromesh mechanism, whereby a disk cluch pressing against a pressure plate or flywheel is separated from the same. After the clutch is completely disengaged, the transmission is switched to the reverse gear position. In this way, easy engagement of reverse gear can be achieved without requiring synchromesh to be fitted to the reverse gear.
