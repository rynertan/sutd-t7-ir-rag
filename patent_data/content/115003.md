# Current source.

## Abstract
A current source circuit 10 is provided wherein the chip area consumption of a Miller multiplication capacitor is substantially reduced. A zero is created in addition to the pole created by the Miller multiplication capacitor. A first transistor 34 is biased by a biasing means 12, 14, 32, 36, 40 and has a base coupled to the emitter of a second transistor 42 by a capacitor. The base of the second transistor is connected to the collector of the first transistor. A resistor 44 is coupled between the emitter of the second transistor and ground.
