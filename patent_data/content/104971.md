# MACHINE TOOL WITH LASER HEAT TREATING

## Abstract
A machine tool 10 for removing metal from a work piece 20 including a laser 14 for surface heat treating of the workpiece 20 . Tools which engage the workpiece 20 for metal removal are supported by a tool turret 26 which is movable along two axes with respect to the workpiece 20 to bring tools into position for metal removal. The laser beam output is connected by beam directing assembly 48 , including a telescoping tube arrangement, to a focusing head 60 which can focus the laser beam. The focusing head 6 can be engaged and positioned by the tool turret 26 . Tool turret 26 is positioned to maintain the laser beam slightly defocused on the workpiece. A coating spray nozzle 62 is positioned with the laser head 60 and is used for coating the workpiece 20 before laser heat treating. A locking mechanism is provided for locking the head 60 to the beam directing assembly 48 . When not being used for heat treating the beam directing assembly, 48 along with the locked focusing head 60 is retracted to a home position. When in the home position a protective cover 90 is positioned over the beam directing assembly. The laser beam is delivered thru telescoping protective tubes by reflective mirrors, which allows the focusing head 60 and directed laser beam to follow motion of the tool turret 26 . Flexible connections are provided for connecting the neces sary air, water, and coating to the various beam delivery and coating members.
