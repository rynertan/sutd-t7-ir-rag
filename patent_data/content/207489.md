# HIGHLY SHRINKABLE POLYESTER FIBER, PROCESS FOR PREPARATION THEREOF, BLENDED POLYESTER YARN AND PROCESS FOR PREPARATION THEREOF

## Abstract
A highly shrinkable polyester fiber composed of a polyes ter comprising ethylene terephthalate units as main recurring units and having a birefringence Î”n of from 0.130 to 0.165, wherein the boiling water shrinkage is at least 30 and the peak temperature and peak value of the thermal stress are 90 to 105 C and at least 0.4 g de, respectively. The fiber has excellent shrinkability as well as high heat resistance, dimen sional stability and alkali resistance and provides a blended polyester yarn excellent in bulkiness and hand.
