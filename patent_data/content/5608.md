# Connector for flat ribbon cable.

## Abstract
A connector for terminating flat ribbon cable composed of flexible electrical insulation and retaining a plurality of electrically isolated, parallel conductors. The connector includes a housing 12 that defines a slot 15 for receiving an end of a flat ribbon cable 16 to be terminated and comprises a base 13 that defines a row of contact receptacles 18 extending transversely to the slot and aligned with individual conductors in the cable. Also comprising the housing is a cover 14 adapted for mating engagement with the base and defining catch wall portions 52 extending transversely to the cable slot. Retained by each of the receptacles is a contact 23 having a head portion 31 having cutting edges 34, 35 shaped and arranged to receive and penetrate the insulation surrounding a different conductor in the cable and to make electrical contact therewith. The contacts also include latch portions 32 for engaging and fastening the cover of the housing to the base. Included in each latching portion is a tab 41 extending substantially longitudinally of the slot and parallel to the cable conductors and arranged to engage the catch wall portion of the cover. Also, the latching and catch wall portions are shaped and arranged such that the forces produced in response to engagement therebetween are oriented so as to have substantially no tendency to cause relative movement between the cutting edges.
