# Light spectrum analyser.

## Abstract
A light spectrum analyser formed by an optical inte grated circuit in which both a light function zone and a light reception zone are monolithically formed on the same substrate to obtain high reliability and low noise and loss. The optical integrated circuit comprises a wave guide layer 2 including a light function zone 3 which, when subjected to an oscillating electrical signal exhibits a piezo electric effect and so diffracts light passing along the wave guide layer 2 , and a light detector 5a, 5b , downstream of the light function zone 3 to detect the diffracted light, characte rised in that the detector 5a, 5b , is monolithically formed in a photo conducting light reception zone 5 of the wave guide layer 2 .
