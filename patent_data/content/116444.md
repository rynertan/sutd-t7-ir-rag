## Description
IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO BENZAZEPINE DERIVATIVES This invention concerns a class of novel benzazepine derivatives, which have ben discovered to be effective antihypertensive agents. It has been estimated that 23 million adultAmericans have high blood pressure Eypertension Mechanisms, Diagnosis Management, J. O. Davis, J. H.Laragh, and A Selwyn, editors, H. P. Publishing Com pany, Inc., New York New York, 1977 p. xi , which is now known to be an underlying cause of a variety of cardiovascular disorders such as heart and kidney diseases as well as stroke. While many drugs are currently available to control hypertension, as a class, the antihypertensive agents are particul2rly prone to produce side effects which at times are severe enough to limit their utility.For example, the vasodilator, hydralazine, which has become increasingly popular during the past several swears to treat hypeftension and chronic heart failure, will produce a significant increase in heart rate reflex tachycardia in many patients which limits the utility of this drug in those individuals with angina or other underlying heart disease. In addition, higher doses of hydralazine have been associated with a lupus like syndrome in susceptible individuals. As a result of the excessive tachycardia commonly observed with hydralazine, other drugs, such as propranolol, are generally used in combination with hydralazine to prevent the increase in heart rate.Therefore, combination therapy with vasodilators has become the norm. Since vasodilators are particularly effective in lowering blood pressure and therefore represent a major class of antihypertensive agents, it is desirable to develop a vasodilating agent which lacks the tachycardia which is characteristic of this class. Certain related benzazepines are found in the literature. For instance, U.S. Patent No. 3,205,222 describes the preparation and use of 2 amino 7 sic,4 halobenzazepines which are said to be cockroach poisons and inhibitors of plum curculio. Similar compounds are found in Bull. Soc. Chim. France, 2, 600 1968 ,Dissertation Abstracts, 19, 2475 l959 , and J. Het. Chem., 2, 26 1965 . This latter reference also describes the hydrogenation of 2 amino 4 bromo lH 3benzazepine to 2 amino lH 3 benzazepine. No utility is disclosed for. this compound. Helvetica Chimica Acta, 64, 373 1981 describes the preparation of 2 amino 5 phenyl lH 3 benzazepines. certain 2 aminobenzazepines were implied as intermediates in the preparation of triazolobenzazepines as described in U.S. Patent 4,022,638 also U.K. Patent 1,453,910, German Patent 2,442,987, and Chemical Abstracts 83 58833d . This invention concerns the discovery that certain 2 amino 1H 3 benzazepines are useful antihypertensive agents which produce little or no reflex tachycardia in most animal models. The benzazepines herein disclosed have been shown to possess two activities 1 they are vasodilators pharmacologically related to hydralazine, and 2 they have the ability to decrease heart rate directly bradycardic activity at doses similar to those required for the vasodilating activity. These two activities provide for a unique profile of action which has not been demonstrated previously.Animal studies indicate that the antihypertensive activity of the present benzazepines results from their vasodilating activity while the bradycardic activity of these compounds serves to attenuate or abolish the reflex tachycardia which would normally result from vasodilitation and the subsequent decrease in blood pressure, as in the case for hydralazine. This invention concerns compounds of the formulaEMI3.1 and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, wherein each RI and R2 is independently hydrogen, hydroxy, halo, C1 C3 alkyl, nitro, amino, mono or di C1 C3 alkylamino, trifluoromethyl, nitrile, amide, acetyl, or C1 C3 alkoxy, or when taken together form a methylenedioxy group or when taken together with the benzene ring to which they are attached form a naphthalene, tetr ahydronaphthal ene, dihydrobenz opyran, dihydrobenzofuran, or indan system each R3 is independently hydrogen, halo,C1 C3 alkyl, or C1 C3 alkoxy R4 is hydrogen, C1 C4 alkyl, allyl, propargyl, or cyclopropyl R5 is hydrogen or methyl with the proviso that R1, R2, R3, R4, and R5 may not all be hydrogen at the same time, and with the further proviso that when both R3 are hydrogen and one of Rl and R2 is hydroxy, the other of RI and R2 may not be hydrogen or hydroxy A preferred group of compounds of formula I above is that wherein each RI and R2 is independently hydrogen, hydroxy, halo, C1 C3 alkyl, nitro, amino, mono or di C1 C3 alkylamino, trifluoromethyl, or C1 C3 alkoxy, or when taken together form a methylenedioxy group or when taken together with the benzene ring.to which they are attached form a naphthalene, tetrahydronaphthalene, or indan system one R3 is hydrogen and the other R3 is hydrogen, C1 C3 alkyl, or C1 C3 alkoxy R4 is hydrogen, C1 C3 alkyl, allyl, propargyl or cyclopropyl and R5 is defined as before.

Also within the scope of the present invention are novel intermediate compounds of formula VII below that are used to prepare the compounds of formula I above. These intermediates are of the formulaEMI9.2 wherein R1, R2, R3, and R5 are as defined above for formula I, Q is halo, O C1 C3 alkyl , S Cl C3 alkyl , SO C1 C3 alkyl , S02 C1 C3 alkyl , 0 or S, and the dotted line represents the presence of a double bond which is only exo to the ring when Q is s or 0, or salts thereof. Especially preferred embodiments of formulaVII are those compounds where Q is methoxy or ethoxy shown by formula VI above , where Q is S shown by formula V above and where Q is O shown by formula IV above . A further aspect of this invention is a pharmaceutical formulation comprising as active ingredient one or more of the benzazepine derivatives of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, associated with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, or excipients therefor. The formulations are particularly useful in treating mammals suffering from hypertension. An additional embodiment of this invention is a method of reducing blood pressure in a mammal with elevated blood pressure and in need of treatment which comprises administering to the mammal a hypotensive dose of a benzazepine derivative of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The term C1 C6 alkyl11 refers to the straight and branched aliphatic radicals of one to six carbon atoms such as methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, n propyl, n butyl, tert butyl, pentyl, isopentyl, hexyl, and the like, and includes within its definition the term C1 C3 alkyl . The term halo refers to fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo.As will be understood by those skilled in the art, when R1 and R2 taken together form a methylenedioxy group or a naphthalene, tetrahydronaphthalene, dihydrobenzopyran, dihydrobenzofuran, or indan system as previously described, the substitution on the aromatic ring will necessarily be at adjacent positions An especially preferred group of compounds of formula I are those wherein a one of R1, R2 and R3 is C1 C3 alkoxy, especially methoxy b two of R1, R2, and R3 are each C1 C3 alkoxy, especially methoxy c one of R1, R2, and R3 is Cl C3 alkyl, especially methyl d two of R1, R2, and 23 are each C1 C3 alkyl, especially methyl e one of R1, R2, and R3is C1 C3 alkoxy, especially methoxy, and another of , R2, and R3 is C1 C3 alkyl, especially methyl f two of R1, R2, and R3 are at the 7 and 8 positions of the ring system g R4 is hydrogen and h Rs is hydrogen. Particularly preferred compounds of formula I are 2 amino 7, 8 dimethoxy lH 3 benzazepine and 2 amino7,8 dimethyl 1H 3 benzazepine. A preferred formulation comprises the compound 2 amino 7,8 dimethoxy 1H 3 benzazepine or a pharma ceutically acceptable salt thereof, especially the hydrochloride salt, in combination with a pharmaceutical carrier therefor. An especially preferred formulation is one intended for oral use. A preferred method of treatment comprises administering a dose effective for lowering blood pressure of the compound 2 amino 7, 8 dimethoxy 1H 3 benzazepine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, especially the hydrochloride salt. The compounds of formula I may be prepared by methods known in the art. One method is described by Johnson and Nasutavicus, J. Ret. Chem., 2, 26 1965 . According to this method, o phenylenediacetonitrile may be cyclized to 2 amino bromo 1H 3 benzazepine in the presence of hydrogen bromide and acetic acid, which upon hydrogenation gives 2 amino lR 3 benzazepine. The compounds of formula I may be prepared in an analogous manner, starting from the appropriately substituted o phenylenediacetonitriles, which may be prepared by reacting. cyanide ion with the respective 1,2 di halo methyl benzenes. The di halomethyl benzenes, otherwise known as alpha , alpha dihalo o xylenes, may be prepared by haloalkylation of benzenes, free radical halogenation of o xylenes, and similar methods known in the art. An alternate and preferred method of preparing the compounds of formula I involves the reaction of a phenylacetic acid II according to the following scheme Scheme IEMI13.1 where R1, R2, R3, R4, and Rs are the same as previously described and R is C1 C6 alkyl. The phenylacetic acid II is converted to the dialkoxyethyl amide III according to any of several known transformations of carboxylic acids into carboxamides. For example, the acid II may be first converted into an acid halide, preferably the acid chloride, by treatment with a halogenating agent, preferably thionyl chloride orsoxalyl chloride, usually in the presence of a weak base, such as pyridine, and optionally in the presence of an inert solvent, such as benzene, xylene, dioxane, and the like. The acid halide may be first isolated or may be used in situ. The acid halide is then allowed to react with an aminoacetaldehyde dialkyl acetal in the presence of a weak base, such as sodium carbonate, and optionally in an inert solvent, such as acetonitrile. An alternate method of preparing compounds of formula III involves the reaction of the phenylacetic acid II with an aminoacetaldehyde dialkyl acetal in the presence of a dehydrating agent such as l,l carbonyldiimidazole. The intermediate amide III can be cyclized to the lactam IV in the presence of any of a number of acidic cyclization reagents, especially polyphosphoric acid, 48 aqueous hydrobromic acid, methanesulfonic acid alone or in combination with phosphorous pentoxide , sulfuric acid, hydrogen chloride in acetic acid, or phosphoric acid. The cyclization occurs at temperatures from about ambient temperature to abdut 1000C. Lactam IV can be transformed into the thiolactam V by heating with phosphorous pentasulfide and a trialkylamine, such as triethylamine, in a nonreactive solvent such as pyridine at temperatures from.about 400C. to about 1000C. Thiolactam V can then be transformed into the desired product I by heating in the presence of the appropriate amine RoNH2 or its salt, optionally in the presence of an alcohol. Temperatures of about 400C. up to the reflux temperature of the mixtures are preferred. Alternatively, lactam IV may be first converted to the corresponding 2 ethoxy or 2 methoxy lH 3 benzazepines VI by treating the intermediate IV with triethyl or trimethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate, respectively, in methylene chloride. Typically, the reaction is complete after stirring for about three days at room temperature. Heating the resulting 2 alkoxy ls 3 benzazepine VI with an acid salt, preferably the acetate, of R4NR2 in a non reactive solvent such as an alcohol gives the desired 2 amino compound I.Reaction temperatures of about 400C. to the reflux temperature of the mixtures are employed. Under the latter condition, the reaction is usually complete within two hours. The compounds of formula I where R4 is other than hydrogen may be formed directly by treating the thiolactam intermediate V with the appropriate amine R41NH2 R4 is C1 C4 alkyl, allyl, propargyl, or cyclopropyl usually in the presence of an alcohol, such as methanol or ethanol, or acetonitrile. The substituted amine derivative may also be obtained directly from the 2 ethoxy or 2 methoxy intermediate VI formed from the lactam compound IV by stirring the alkoxy intermediate in an alcohol solution of the acetate salt of R4NE2. The substituted amine compounds of formula I may also be formed from the preferred unsubstituted compounds formula I, R4 is hydrogen by stirring with a 2 NH2 salt in an alcohol at temperatures from about ambient temperature up to the reflux temperature of the mixture. The 1 methyl compounds of formula I may be prepared from the corresponding 1 1 haloethyl 2 halomethyl benzenes by the procedure of Johnson andNasutavicus or from the a methylphenyl acetic acid derivatives following Scheme I. A preferred method, however, is by alkylating one of the intermediates ofScheme I where R5 is hydrogen, preferably a 2 ethoxyor 2 methoxy 1H 3 benzazepine compound, by first treating with a strong basle, such as lithium diisopropyl amide, followed by treatment with a methyl halide. The reaction of the intermediate and the strong base is preferably carried out at 20 to 780C. in a non reactive solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran. The methyl compound of formula I may then be prepared from the corresponding 1 methyl intermediate according to the same procedures as previously described. Certain compounds of formula I may be prepared by the transformation of other compounds of formula I. For example, 2 amino 7,8 dihydroxy 1H 3 benzazepine or a suitable precursor thereof, may be prepared from the respective 7,8 dimethoxy congener by treating with boron tribromide in 1,2 dichloroethane. This dihydroxy intermediate may then be dialkylated with the appropriate alkyl halide in the usual way to give the corresponding 7,8 dialkoxy derivative. Other alkoxy compounds may be similarly prepared. Other cleavage reactions which may be employed include methanesulfonic acid methionine and ethanethiol aluminum chloride in the presence of 1,2 dichloroethane. In the case of the 7, 8 dimethoxy compound of formula I, the former reaction results in selective ether cleavage to give the 7 hydroxy 8 methoxy compound while the latter reaction provides the 7 methoxy 8 hydroxy derivative.This also provides an alternate preparation of dissimilar alkoxy substituted compounds of formula I. When two or more alkoxy groups are present they are all converted to the corresponding hydroxy compound by cleavage using known reagents such as PBr3 in a halogenated hydrocarbon solvent, such as dichloromethane or HBr in glacial acetic acid. Other compounds of formula I may be formed by transformations such as nitration. For instance, 2 amino 1H 3 benzazepine may be nitrated to give the 8 nitro derivative which may then be reduced to the corresponding amine compound. An amine compound may be alkylated to give the mono or di alkyl amine substituents on the aromatic ring. The amine functionalities may also be introduced by heating the corresponding halo derivative of formula I with the appropriate amine in a high boiling non reactive solvent to provide the corresponding amino and mono and dialkylamino compounds of formula I. Other methods which can be used to form the compounds of formula I use a cyclization of an aldehyde of formula If above with an acid having the 2 amino group protected. The cyclization occurs in one step with concomment removal of the protecting group, if needed. Examples of a protecting group would beR4, defined above, trimethylsilane, or other silyl functions. Suitable acids are mineral acids, such as sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid, organic acids, such as acetic acid or prop ironic acid, or any acid customarily used in acid catalysis. The compounds of formula Ig above are converted to the compounds of formula I by removal of the protecting group Z. Examples of such protecting groups and their removal are well known in the art. Some of these groups are described above for formula If. When Z is NH2 or NHZ where Z is a protecting moiety, the corresponding primary amine is formed by hydrogenation.When Z is phthalic anhydride, the corresponding primary amine is formed by hydrolysis under either acidic or basic conditions. When Z is CO C1 C3 alkyl , CO phenyl, CO CF3, benzyl, CH phenyl 2 methoxyphenyl ,. or CE2 CE CH2, the primary amine is formed by hydrolysis under either acidic or basic conditions, hydrogenation under standard conditions, or water and PdC12 when Z is CE2 CE CH2 When Z is OH, O C1 C3 alkyl , or CO C1 C3 alkyl , then H2 Pd, H2 Pt or LiA1Hy is used under standard reaction conditions. Introducing the A4 doddle bond in a compound of formula Ih above can be done by a variety of methods.When the L term is hydrogen, the double bond is formed by using dichlorodicyanobenzoquinone DDQ , MnO2, or Pd in a solvent such as dioxane, hydrocarbons e.g hexane, or halogenated solvents, e.g. dichloromethane, at reflux. When L is a leaving group other than hydrogen,L is cleaved to form the double bond using a polar solvent, with an acid catalyst, at reflux temperature.The compound of formula Ih can be formed by cyclization methods known in the literature and is formed in situ in the reaction mixture or is isolated therefrom if desired. Examples of L moieties under the above conditions are hydrogen halogen V C1 C3 alkyl,EMI19.1 where V is O, S, N, P or SO2 trialkylamine orEMI19.2 Reat or acid and heat is used to effect the removal of L. Another cleavage reaction involving cleaving group is described above where the L term of formula Ii is reacted with a hydrogenating agent, e.g. H2 Pd, H2 Pt, under standard conditions, in the presence of a base such as NaHCO3 or K2CO3. The L moiety is defined asL above, but excluding hydrogen. The compounds of formula Id above are reacted by hydrogenation conditions as described for the reaction of the compounds of formula Ii above. L is defined as for formula Ii above. The pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of formula I include salts derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydrolodic acid, phosphorous acid and the like, as well as salts derived from nontoxic organic acids such as aliphatic mono and dicarboxylic acids, phenyl substituted alkanoic acids, hydroxy alkanoic and alkandioic acids, aromatic acids, aliphatic and aromatic sulfonic acids, etc.Such pharmaceutically acceptable salts thus include sulfate, pyrosulfate, bisulfate, sulfite, bisulfite, nitrate, phosphate, monohydrogenphosphate, dihydrogenphosphate, metaphosphate, pyrophosphate, chloride, bromide, iodide, acetate, propionate, decanoate, caprylate, acrylate, formate, isobutyrate, caprate, heptanoate, propiolate, malonate, succinate, suberate, sebacate, fumarate, maleate, mandelate, butyne 1,4 dioate, hexyne 1, 6 dioate, benzoate, chlorobenzoate, methylbenzoate, hydroxybenzoate, methoxybenzoate, phthalate, terephthalate, benzenesulfonate, toluenesulfonate, chlorobenzenesulfonate, xylenesulfonate, phenylacetate, phenylpropionate, phenylbutyrate, filtrate, lactate, B hydroxybutyrate, glycollate, malay, tartrate, methanesulfonate, propanesulfonate, naphthalene l sulfonate, naphthalene 2 sulfonate, and the like salts.The preferred salt form is the hydrochloric acid salt. The compounds of formula I may be administered by any number of routes, including the oral, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, transdermal, and rectal routes, usually employed in the form of a pharmaceutical composition, although it is a special feature of the compounds of formula I that they are effective when administered orally. Such compositions are prepared in a manner well known in the pharmaceutical art and comprise one or more active compounds of formula I. Accordingly, the invention includes a pharmaceutical composition comprising as active ingredient a compound of formula I, or an acid addition salt thereof, associated with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.In making the compositions of the present invention, the active ingredient will usually be mixed with a carrier, or diluted by a carrier, or enclosed within a carrier which may be in the form of a capsule, sachet, paper or other container. When the carrier serves as a diluent, it may be a solid, semi solid or liquid material which acts as a vehicle, excipient or medium for the active ingredient. Thus the composition can be in the form of tablets, pills, powders, lozenges, sachets, cachets, elixirs, emulsions, solutions, syrups, suspensions, aerosols as a solid or in a liquid medium , ointments containing for example up to 10 by weight of the active compound, soft and hard gelatin capsules, suppositories, sterile inJection solutions, and sterile packaged powders. Some examples of suitable carriers are lactose, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol, mannitol, starches, gum acacia, calcium phosphate, alginates, calcium silicate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulose, tragacanth, gelatin, syrup, methyl cellulose, methyl and propylhydroxybenzoates, talc, magnesium stearate, water1 or mineral oil. Either solid or liquid formulations can include lubricating agents, wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, preserving agents, sweetening agents or flavoring agents. The present compositions may, as is well known in the art, be formulated so as to provide quick, sustained or delayed release of the active ingredient of formula 1 after administration to the patient. For oral administration, which is preferred, a compound of formula I is admixed with carriers and diluents and molded into tablets or enclosed in gelatin capsules The mixtures can alternatively be dissolved in liquids such as ten percent aqueous glucose solution, isotonic saline, sterile water, or the like, and administered intravenously or by injection. Such solutions can, if desired, be lyophilized and stored in a sterile ampoule ready for reconstitution by theaddition of sterile water for ready intramuscular injection. Preferably the compositions are formulated in a unit dosage form, each dosage containing from 5 to 500 mg., more usually 25 to 300 mg, of the active ingredient of formula I. The term unit dosage form refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human subjects and animals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The active compounds of formula I are effective over a wide dosage range. For example, dosages per day will normally fall within the range of 0.S to 300 mg. kg. In the treatment of adult humans, the range of about 1 to 50 mg. kg., in single or divided doses, is preferred. However it will be understood that the amount of the compound actually administered will be determined by a physician, in the light of the relevant circumstances including the condition to be treated, the choice of compound to be administered, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, the severity of the patients symptoms, and the chosen route of administration, and therefore the above dosage ranges are not intended to limit the scope of the invention in any way. Although the compounds of formula I are effective antihypertensive agents by themselves, they may also be administered in combination with one or more other antihypertensive and or diuretic agents if desired. Such therapy may be provided by administering the agents as individual dosage units or as a single dosage unit comprising a mixture of the agents. Such additional agents include clonidine, methyldopa, hydralazine, diazoxide, amiloride, nifedipine, propranolol, reserpine, timolol, cyclothiazide, hydrochlorothiazide, indacrinone, and the like.

Although they demonstrate this useful activity in the laboratory in both normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive mammals, the compounds would be employed to lower blood pressure of mammals having an elevated blood pressure. Thus, this invention also provides a method of lowering blood pressure in a mammal having an elevated blood pressure and in need of treatment, employing a hypotensive dose of a compound of formula I. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of formula I are, of course, equally useful in treating hypertension.Certain compounds offormula I were examined as to their pharmacodynamic effects in the following test system. Determination of Antihyoertensive Activity Spontaneously hypertensive male rats were anesthetized with methoxyflurane and a chloralose 120 mg. kg., i.v. . An aqueous solution of the compound of formula I to be tested was administered i.p. to the animal following a 15 20 minute equilibrium period.Systemic arterial blood pressure was measured from the right carotid artery via a Statham P23 ID pressure transducer and recorded on a Model R411 BeckmanDynograph recorder. Heart rate was recorded with a Beckman 9857B cardiotachometer triggered by the pulse pressure . Mean arterial pressure was calculated as the diastolic pressure plus one third of the pulse pressure. Antihypertensive responses were measured at the maximal reduction in blood pressure occurring within 30 minutes after drug administration as compared to the baseline measurements taken prior to administration of the compound. The effect on heart rate was determined at the same time the maximum reduction in blood pressure was seen and was also compared with the baseline heart rate prior to compound administration. The results in Table I are reported as the maximal reduction in blood pressure and the corresponding effect on heart rate for certain compounds of formula I. The results are the average of two or more experiments.
