## Description
The present invention relates to modified livepseudorabies virus, vaccines for pseudorabiesdisease containing same,and methods for use of same. Pseudorabies, a highly contagious disease ofswine and other livestock, such as cattle, sheep, andgoats, is caused by Pseudorabies has become a major threat and causeof economic loss to the swine industry throughoutthe world. There is also considerable alarm overthe spread of pseudorabies to cattle and other farmanimals. Within the last ten years, economic losseshave escalated because of the emergence of morevirulent strains of PRV and the widespread disseminationof the disease. Today, it is estimated that 8.0 of the 80 million hogs on farms in the United Statesare infected, in comparison to less than 0.8 a decadeago. The clinical symptoms and consequences of PRVinfection may be moderated or prevented by the useof vaccines comprising either killed or attenuatedstrains of PRV. However, existing vaccines have failed to control the spread of pseudorabies diseasebecause of a unique feature of PRV and the other alphaherpesviruses, such as herpes simplex virus types 1and 2 hereinafter HSV 1 and HSV 2 , respectively ,varicella zoster, infectious bovine rhinotracheitisvirus hereinafter IBRV , marmoset herpesvirus hereinafter MarHV , and equine herpesvirus type 1. More specifically, alpha herpesviruses have thespecial ability to enter into a dormant state, whichdoes not occur with other families of viruses. Thatis, as an animal recovers from the initial generalizedinfection, alpha herpesviruses retreat to portionsof the nervous system where they become quiescentand impervious to the body s immune defenses. Thisdormant infection, i.e. latency, may be unexpectedlyreactivated, resulting in recrudescence of disease orin a contagious condition known as the carrier state,wherein the infected animal shows no outward symptomsof the disease but can transmit or shed infectiousalpha herpesviruses intermittently, so as to cause thespread of infection. Previous modified live virus PRV vaccines havebeen produced by multiple passages of the virus inchick and or monkey tissue culture cells see Skoda,R., Brauner, I., Sadecky, E., and Mayer V. A problem with the currently marketed modifiedlive virus PRV vaccines is that the animal becomes acarrier of the dormant vaccine virus. As a consequence,usage of these vaccines can result in twoundesirable situations which impede their safety and effectiveness. First, abortions, stillbirths, andfatal infections in newborns can be caused by somevaccine viruses as they are shed by vaccinated carriers.Second, the repeated circulation of vaccinevirus within a herd can result in a reversal of theprocess of attenuation such that the vaccine virusreverts to the pathogenic parent strain. Under suchcircumstances, widespread vaccination will undesirablypromote the dissemination of the disease. In addition to the above described inadequacies,known PRV vaccines, while substantially minimizingsymptoms of illness, do not prevent the animal fromacquiring a dormant infection with pathogenic fieldstrains. Thus, despite vaccination, an animal maybecome a carrier of the disease and transmit it tosusceptible animals. These carriers of the disease,when moved between farms and market, will shed notonly the dormant vaccine virus as discussed above,but also the disease virus. This results in theundesirable transmission of the disease across geographicbarriers and state boundaries. Upon infection of permissive cells, alpha herpesvirusesinduce the synthesis of virus encoded enzymesimportant to the viral life cycle see Kit, S. In The function of TK is to catalyze the phosphorylationof deoxythymidine to deoxythymidine monophosphate hereinafter dTMP which in turn isfurther phosphorylated to dTTP, i.e. an essentialbuilding block of DNA. TK also indirectly facilitatesthe synthesis of the other essential building blocksof DNA, i.e. dCTP, dGTP, and dATP. Alpha herpesvirusescannot reproduce themselves without these buildingblocks see Kit, S., Leung, W. C., Jorgensen, G. N.,Trkula, D., and Dubbs, D. R. Most tissues of the host produce sufficientamounts of endogenous cell TK, i.e. TK encoded by thegenome of the host, to allow for the synthesis of dTMPand dTTP from deoxythymidine and thus allow for viralreproduction. However, non dividing tissues, such asnerve tissues produce only low levels of endogenouscell TK and thus can only support efficient viral DNAsynthesis, and thus viral reproduction, if TK isprovided by the infecting virus. The pivotal role ofthe viral encoded TK in supporting infections of nervetissues and the establishment of latent infections inganglia have been demonstrated in studies of HSV,MarHV, and PRV mutants deficient in inducing thisenzyme hereinafer tk More specifically, HSV tk Furthermore, mice may be safely inoculated withdoses of mutant PRV tk It has been shown that many nucleoside analogsinhibit alpha herpesvirus replication. The antiviralnucleosides include analogs of thymidine such as 5 bromodeoxyuridine,5 iododeoxyuridine, 5 fluorodeoxyuridine,trifluorodeoxythymidine, 5 bromovinyldeoxyuridineand 5 amino 5 iododeoxyuridine hereinafter BrdUrd , IdUrd , FdUrd , F The above described nucleoside analogs differ intheir antiviral activities. For example, the concentrationsof BVDU and ACG required to inhibit HSV 1replication are significantly lower than those neededto inhibit HSV 2 replication. Further, FIAC, ACG andDHPG are useful drugs against both HSV 1 and HSV 2,but are ineffective against PRV and IBRV. The mechanisms by which these drugs inhibit alphaherpesvirus replication vary. However, all of thenucleoside analogs must be activated to nucleosidetriphosphates before they can exert their antiviraleffects. The first step in this activation requiresthe catalytic action of the salvage pathway enzyme,TK. In the absence of TK activity, most of theseantiviral drugs are not inhibitory. As stated above, the endogenous cell TK catalyzesthe phosphorylation of deoxythymidine to dTMP. Theendogenous cell TK also catalyzes the phosphorylationof deoxyuridine to deoxyuridine monophosphate hereinafter dUMP , i.e. a precursor of dTMP. In addition,the endogenous cell TK catalyzes the phosphorylationof several nucleoside analogs, i.e. BrdUrd, IdUrd,FdUrd, F The HSV encoded TK is remarkable for its broadsubstrate specificity. That is, the HSV encoded TKefficiently catalyzes the phosphorylation of deoxythymidineand deoxycytidine and their analogs arabinosylderivatives of deoxythymidine and deoxycytidine, suchas FMAU and FIAC ACG and DHPG. The PRV encoded TK resembles the HSV encoded TKin many biochemical properties, but differs fromthe HSV encoded TK in antigenic determinants and insubstrate specificity see Kit, S., Leung, W. C.,Jorgensen, G. N., Trkula, D., and Dubbs, D. R. After the antiviral drugs are activated to deoxyribonucleosidetriphosphates, each is metabolized differentlyin alpha herpesvirus infected cells. BrdUrd,IdUrd, and BVdU are extensively incorporated in placeof deoxythymidine in viral DNA see Allaudeen, H. S.,Chen, M. S., Lee, J. J., De Clercq, E., and Prusoff,W. H. Triphosphates of many of the analogs, for example,araT, FMAU and FIAC are preferentially bound byalpha herpesvirus DNA polymerases and competitivelyinhibit the utilization of the natural triphosphatesin DNA synthesis see Ruth, J. L and Cheng, Y. C. The triphosphate of ACG is selectively utilizedfor DNA synthesis in HSV infected cells, but terminatesDNA chains because the drug lacks a 3 hydroxygroup. AraT, FMAU, and FIAC selectively inhibit HSVDNA synthesis, but are not incorporated significantlyinto replicating DNA chains. To avoid the antiviral effects of nucleosideanalogs, alpha herpesviruses mutate to drug resistance.Drug resistant mutants arise spontaneouslydue to imperfections in the DNA replication mechanismsin all replicating alpha herpesvirus populations withan incidence of about 10 Three types of drug resistant alpha herpesvirusmutants have been detected, i.e. alpha herpesviruseshaving 1 a mutation in the viral tk gene 2 amutation in the viral DNA polymerase gene and 3 mutationsin both genes. The mutations in the viral TK and viral DNApolymerase genes can be subdivided into additional classes. That is, some of the viral TK and viralDNA polymerase mutations cause a complete loss ofactivity, while others only cause a partial loss ofactivity or selectively diminish the ability of themutant enzymes to recognize their substrates see Veerisetty, V. and Gentry, G. A. The most effective mechanism for developing drugresistance is by eliminating any expression of viralTK activity see Dubbs, D. R. and Kit, S. Several different types of viral TK mutantslacking any TK activity are known. Some of thesemutants induce the synthesis of intact, but nonfunctional,TK. These mutants either have changed aminoacids at the active centers of the enzyme or mutationsthat alter polypeptide folding, i.e. a temperature sensitiveTK. Other mutants, e.g. HSV 1 B2006 ,fail to induce production of any TK, possibly as aresult of nonsense mutations at codons near the aminoterminus of the polypeptide. Still other mutants induce inactive, short polypeptides as a result ofnonsense mutations in the middle of the tk gene. Thistype of mutation can be suppressed with suppressortRNAs so that partial TK activity can be restored.Finally, mutants without any TK activity result fromthe deletion of nucleotides within the coding regionof the tk gene. The first procedure ever used to obtain HSV tk tk Besides being highly attenuated, tk G. Tatarov According to J.T. van Oirschot et al It is further shown by B. Toma et al Many of the alpha herpesvirus tk tk Methods for the construction of recombinant HSV 1tk In the above described methods for the constructionof alpha herpesvirus tk For HSV 1, efficient selection is possible usingBrdUrd, araT, or BrdCyd to prevent plaque formationby HSV 1 tk However, the above described procedures are noteffective for isolating PRV tk The difference between the response of HSV 1 andthat of PRV can be attributed to the dissimilar propertiesof the PRV and HSV 1 encoded enzymes, i.e. TK,DNA polymerase and ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase to differences in the composition of the deoxyribonucleosidetriphosphate pools of cells infected bythe two viruses and possibly to differences in theability of PRV and HSV induced nucleases to degradeand utilize cellular DNA for viral synthesis. Thus,in the case of PRV, an enrichment selection step isrequired to increase the proportion of PRV tk A pseudorabies virus derived from the PRV strainNIA 3 and a life virus vaccine is described inEP A 141 458. Said PRV which is obtained by recombinant DNA techniques fails to producefunctional tk as a result of a deletion in the tkgene. All the deletions are within the invertedrepeat IR and unique short region U Ben Porat et al, In summary, while the methods described aboveare adequate for introducing deletions of foreignDNA sequences into the tk gene of HSV 1 recombinants, they fail to teach or suggest how to introduce deletionsinto the tk gene of PRV recombinants since 1 the approximate boundaries of the nucleotidesequences delimiting the coding region of the PRV tkgene have not previously been determined, 2 there isno teaching on the restriction sites within a PRV tkgene to allow appropriate deletions to be made in acloned PRV tk gene and 3 as previously discussed,the drugs employed with HSV 1 are inadequate for PRVso that modified enrichment and selection proceduresmust be developed. Consequently, not only is thereinsufficient information to use the known proceduresfor the isolation of deletion mutants in the PRV tkgene, but also the known procedures will not work inthe PRV system. Accordingly, an object of the present inventionis to provide a pseudorabies vaccine effective incontrolling the spread of pseudorabies disease. Another object of the present invention is toprovide a pseudorabies vaccine wherein the animalvaccinated with such is less likely to become acarrier of the vaccine virus. A further object of the present invention is toprovide a pseudorabies vaccine wherein the animalvaccinated with such is unlikely to acquire a dormantinfection with pathogenic field strains. A still further object of the present inventionis to provide a pseudorabies vaccine wherein thevaccine virus fails to produce any functional TK. An additional object of the present invention isto provide a pseudorabies vaccine wherein the vaccine virus is a tk In one further embodiment of the present invention, theabove described objects have been met by a pseudorabiesvirus which fails to produce any functional TK as a result ofa deletion in the tk gene, said tk gene correspondingessentially to the tk gene sequence shown in Fig. 5, whereinsaid virus has the identifying characteristics of PRV BUK dl3 ATCC No. VR 2074 , and a modified live virus vaccinefor pseudorabies comprising 1 a pharmaceutically effectiveamount of a pseudorabies virus obtainable by recombinant DNAtechniques which fails to produce a functional TK as a resultof a deletion of the tk gene, said tk gene correspondingessentially to the tk gene sequence shown in Fig. 5, and 2 a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. In a still further embodiment of the present invention, theabove described objects have been met by a modified livevirus vaccine for pseudorabies disease comprising 1 apharmaceutically acceptable amount of a temperature resistantvirus which fails to produce any functional TK as a result ofa deletion in the tk gene, said tk gene correspondingessentially to the tk gene sequence shown in Fig. 5,obtainable by the following process steps a constructing ahybrid plasmid comprising a cloning vector and a DNA fragmentof PRV containing substantially all of the PRV tk gene b co transfecting, in tk Figure 1 schematically illustrates, by example,the derivation of pseudorabies virus strains of thepresent invention.

Insertion of the BamHI 11 fragment ofPRV BUK 7 into pBR322 produces hybrid plasmid pBB 11.Plasmid pBB 11 dl SacA26 is obtained by deleting the1.0 kb SacI A fragment and the 0.1 kb SacI C fragmentfrom pBB 11.

In creating a temperature resistant PRV tk The process of this embodiment of the presentinvention comprises the following steps 1 plaque purifyinga PRV tk Plaque purification provides a means of purifyingthe starting materials to be used for vaccine virusformation since field isolates and known attenuatedstrains often comprise a mixture of different viruses. The specific PRV tk In the context of this invention, a temperature resistantvirus is a virus which is non temperaturesensitive. Thus, a temperature resistant virus iscapable of replicating, at a non permissive temperature,i.e. about 38.5 C to 40 C, preferably 39.1 C,about as well as the parental virus or fieldisolates of PRV replicate at a permissive temperature.By contrast, temperature sensitive PRV strains containmutations in viral genes essential for replication,whereby functional gene products are produced atpermissive temperatures, i.e. about 33 C to 37.5 C,preferably 34.5 C, but not at non permissive temperatures.Therefore, in temperature sensitive viruses,production of infectious virus particles is 4 to 7logs lower at the non permissive temperatures comparedto production at permissive temperatures. Withtemperature resistant virus strains, production of infectious virus particles is about the same at non permissivetemperatures as at permissive temperatures. Some temperature sensitive respiratory virusstrains, for example, a temperature sensitive mutantof IBRV, have previously been used as modified live virusvaccines see Pastoret, P. P., Thiry, E.,Brocphier, b., and Derboven, G., Temperature resistant viruses are superior totemperature sensitive viruses as modified live virusvaccines because 1 attenuation results from alterationsin specific pathogenic virus genes rather thanfrom crippling viral genes required for replication and 2 the temperature resistant virus strains canreplicate more extensively at the site of inoculationand elicit a more complete and prolonged immunologicalresponse. The specific tk The specific tk The specific mutagen employed in the presentinvention is not critical. Examples of such mutagensinclude BrdUrd, NH By utilizing BrdUrd both as a mutagen and as aselective agent, it is possible to introduce multiplemutations not only in the viral tk gene but throughoutthe viral genome, and thus to obtain an attenuatedPRV mutant lacking any TK activity and exhibiting alow reversion rate, i.e., a reversion rate of about10 The specific selection agent employed in thepresent invention is not critical as long as theselection agent is able to select for tk Similar procedures have also been applied to theisolation of a different tk The present inventionrelates to temperature resistant tk Since the mutants lack partof the DNA sequence coding for TK, reversion to tk
