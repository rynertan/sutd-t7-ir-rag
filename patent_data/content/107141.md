# Method of vegetally propagating plants and analog to natural botanic seed for implementing said method.

## Abstract
A novel analog to natural botanic seed, together with a process for producing this analog are provided. Plant meristematic tissue capable of producing an entire plant body, and generally from somatic sources, is encapsulated in a gel which protects the tissue during development, while allowing the meristem to grow and mature as normal plants. The chemical and mechanical characteristics of the gel can be varied to suit any plant or method of handling, while allowing inclusion of growth and development enhancing substances.
