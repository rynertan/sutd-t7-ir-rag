## Description
METHOD FCR THE ESTIMATION OF SALICYLATES OR REDUCED PYRIDINE NUCLEOTIDES This invention relates to a method for the estimation of salicylates or reduced pyridine nucleotides, and to a diagnostic kit adapted to facilitate the routine performance of said method. A number of methods for estimating salicylate in a sample or in a solution are known. For example, the salicylate ion can be reacted with the Folin Ciocalteau reagent in a strongly alkaline solution to produce a blue colour which is then analysed colorimetrically Smith Talbot 1950, Brit J Exo Path. 51, 65 .This method, however, gives high and variable blank values in samples where salicylates are absent. Alternatively, the salicylate ion can be reacted with ferric salts in acidic solution and the purple colour produced analysed by a colorimetric means. Trinder 1954, Biochem J. 57, 301 .This method too has disadvantages, and is subject to non specific interference. In another method of salicylate estimation, the salicylate is first converted enzymically to form pyrocatechol. The latter compound is then reacted with hydrazone and molecular oxygen in the presence of a second enzyme, tyrosinase, to form an azine dye. Roder et al 1980, EP 0 054 146 . The enzyme tyrosinase is known to oxidise monophenols other than pyrocatechol, and hydrazone may couple oxidatively with any resulting quinones to form a coloured product. Furthermore, the presence of other monophenols and particularly of tgrosine in unknown quantities may result in competition for binding sites on the tyrosinase enzyme, reducing the efficiency of the system. There is a requirement to estimate the level of salicylate compounds, particularly the drugs ortho acetyl salicylic acid aspirin and salicylic acid which is commonly used as its sodium salt in a biological fluid. In such cases, and especially where a patient is suffering from a drug overdose, it is important that the drug level in the body may be assessed rapidly so that an antidote or other treatment may, if necessary, be administered. Although the above described methods are useful in meeting this requirement to some extent, they have disadvantages in that they may require solvent extraction or suffer from interfering activity. It is one object of the present invention to provide a method for the estimation of salicylate by which the above disadvantages are overcome or at least mitigated, but which still produces an estimation of salicylate level sufficiently quickly to allow the method to be used in the determination of drug levels in the biological fluids of suspected overdose patients. According to a first aspect of the present invention, therefore, there is provided a method for the estimation of a salicylate in a sample comprising enzymically converting the salicylate to a catechol by the action of a salicylate monooxygenase enzyme on the salicylate in the presence of a reduced pyridine nucleotide especially NADH or NAD P H , reacting the catechol with an aminophenol to form an indophenol and estimating the quantity of the indophenol spectrophotometrically, the quantity of the indophenol being a measure of the salicylate in the sample. Preferably the indophenol is estimated colormetrically. The invention is based on the following reactions usingNAD P H or NADH to exemplify the reduced pyridine nucleotide Salieylate Mono oxygenase NAD P H O2 i Salicylate or NADH 2 or NADH EMI2.1 Catechol CO2 H2O NAD P or NAD ii Catechol AminophenolEMI2.2 Indophenol ... 3 In reaction A above, the reduced pyridine nucleotide comprising either reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide NADH or reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate NAD P H is converted to its respective oxidised form nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide NAD or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate NAD P . The conversion of the salicylate to the catecholis catalysed by any salicylate mono oxygenase decarboxylating and hydroxylating by the International Union of Biochemistry Enzyme Nomenclature 1978, Academic Press, New York, 1979 .In thecatalysed reaction the enzyme and the reduced pyridine nucleotide are present in excess. If the assay reaction mixture contains high concentrations of metal ions then a metal chelating agent, preferably in the concentration 0.1 to 1.0 mmol should also be added to safeguard enzyme activity.Where the salicylate is present in the form of an acetylated derivative, it should first be converted to its non acetylated form by hydrolysis of the acetylated derivative for example in a reaction catalysed by any enzyme of the type defined as EC 3.1.1.2. and named as arylester hydrolase by the International Union of Biochemistry reference as above .The unsubstituted form of the present indophenol has theFormula IEMI3.1 The conversion of catechol to indophenol is performed by reacting the catechol with an amino substituted phenol, especially paraaminophenol. In this especially preferred embodiment the reaction of catechol with para aminophenol is fast, highly specific, and produces a relatively colour stable dye. Preferably, the conversion of catechol to indophenol is performed in a substantially aqueous solution, at a neutral or, which is preferred, an alkaline pH. In a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention the conversion is effected at a pH of above 10.0, especially about pH 12. to 13. When the formation of the indophenol is carried out under conditions appropriate to allow a maximum rate of colour formation, it may be completed in under three minutes with serum samples. Once produced, the dye is generally stable for at least one hour. The colour producing reaction with aminophenol, especially para aminophenol, is highly specific. No interfering colour formation is observed in the reaction of aminophenol with salicylate, acetylated salicylate, acylanilides, such as hydroxyacetanilide, or with tyrosine. The present procedure, therefore provides a rapid and specific method for the determination of salicylate which will be particularly useful when the salicylate is present in biological fluids. The spectrophotometric analysis of the indophenol may be carried out at any wavelength at which the dye absorbs, but is preferably carried at the wavelength of maximum absorption.When the indophenol is formed by reaction of catechol with paraaminophenol this wavelength is 565 nm. The present method of detecting salicylates will have many applications, but will be of particular use when a rapid but routine method of analysis is required, especially when the fluid in which the salicylate is present contains other constituents which are known to interfere in alternative methods of analysis. The present method will be particularly useful in the medical field for the detection of analgesic formulations based upon the drug salicylate. In this case the salicylate will tend to be in admixture with other drug derivatives that are known to interfere in the traditional means of rapid analysis. The requirement for a co factor, especially either NAD P H or NADH, in the enzymatic conversion of salicylate to catechol by salicylate mono oxygenase, means that the present reaction scheme may also be employed in the estimation of a reduced pyridinenucleotide, especially either NADH or NAD P H. Examples of reactions where NADH or HAD P H may be produced and then estimated include the action of dehydrogenase enzymes on substrates such as glucose or triglycerides, or lactate ..Accordingly, the present invention further provides in a second aspect of the present invention a method for the estimation of a reduced pyridine nucleotide especially NADH or NAD P H in a sample comprising enzymically converting a salicylate to a catechol by the action of a salicylate mono oxygenase enzyme on the salicylate in the presence of the reduced pyridine nucleotide, reacting the catechol with an aminophenol to form an indophenol, and estimating the quantity of the indophenol spectrophotometrically, the quantity of the indophenol being a measure of the reduced pyridine nucleotide in the sample. Preferably the indophenol is estimated colorimetrically. The method for estimating a reduced pyridinenucleotide is also based on reactions A and B above. However, in this case, unlike the estimation of salicylate when enzyme and reduced pyridine nucleotide are in excess , the salicylate and the enzyme are present in excess. As before, the catechol is conveniently converted to an indophenol by aminophenol. In order to further facilitate the use of the present methods of analysis in a routine manner, especially in medical techniques, the invention further provides a diagnostic kit for use in the estimation of a salicylate, or a reduced pyridine nucleotide especially NADH or NAD P H by a process of the present invention comprising a. a salicylate mono oxygenase enzyme suitable for the conversion of salicylate to a catechol in the presence of a reduced pyridinenucleotide, b. an amino phenol suitable for the conversion of the catechol to an indophenol.As outlined above, the salicylate mono oxygenase enzyme is any of those defined as BC 1.14.13.1 by the International Union ofBiochemistry. The aminophenol is preferably aminophenol. The enzyme may be in solution, preferably aqueous solution.In this case, in order to retain the activity of the salicylate mono oxygenase enzyme over prolonged periods of time, the enzyme solution preferably contains glycerol, or may be lyophilised in the presence of a protective agent. This protective agent may be a sugar, most especially glucose, lactose, raffinose or a polysaccharide. Alternatively, the enzyme may be impregnated onto a solid or a semi solid support. In this case a porous material, such as paper, is particularly preferred. In order to further retain the activity of the enzyme, it may be stored at low temperature 50 to 200C either with the other components of the kit or separately from them. The aminophenol may also be present in the kit in the form of a solution, preferably an aqueous solution. Alternatively the aminophenol may be impregnated onto a solid or a semi solid support. In this case a porous material, such as paper, is particularly preferred. In one embodiment of the present kit both the enzyme and the aminophenol are inpregnated onto a porous material, such as paper, which is then used in the form of a test strip. In order to facilitate the use of the kit of this invention, each kit may be supplied with a set of instructions setting out the steps involved in the assay procedure. The application of the present process is further illustrated by the following examples.Example 1 Salicylate estimation Reagents aIl in aqueous solution Salicylate mono oxygenase 1.0 U ml 1 NADH or NAD P H 0.35 mmol 1 as one reagentTris hydrochloride pH 8.2 100 mmol i l p Aminophenol in 0.1 mol litre HCL 0.9 mmol 1 Sodium hydroxide 0.25 mol 1 Procedure 50 e of sample was mixed with 1000 of buffer NADH orNAD P H salicylate mono oxygenase solution and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. The sample solution was a standard aqueous solution containing a known molar concentration of salicylate ions.To the above reaction mixture were added 1.0 ml sodium hydroxide solution and 1.0 ml para aminophenol solution and the mixture was retained at room temperature for 3 minutes. The absorbance at 565 nm of the dye produced in this mixture was then read, and the absorbance value plotted on a graph against the known salicylate molar concentration in the original sample. The above procedure was repeated for several further standard sample solutions each containing different but known concentrations of salicylate ions up to a maximum salicylate ion concentration of 6 mmol 1, so that a standard calibration curve of salicylate molar concentration in solution against absorbance was built up. This curve indicated that the assay was linear up to a salicylate concentration of 5.0 mmol 1 in the original sample solution. 50 P of an aqueous sample solution containing an unknown concentration of salicylate ions was subjected to the above reaction procedure, and its salicylate concentration was then read from the standard salicylate calibration curve. Using the above procedure, accurate estimations of salicylate concentrations up to 5.0 mmol 1 1 in sample solutions could be made. For sample solutions containing higher concentrations, dilution of the sample stock solutions with knotm volumes of water was first required before measuring out the sample solution volume of 50 ExamPle 2 Reduced nyridine nucleotide NADH estimationReagents all in aau eous solution Salicylate mono oxygenase 20 U mlSodium salicylate 100 mmol 1 1 Tris hydrochloride, pH 8.2 100 mmol 1 n Aminophenol in 0.1 mol litre 1 HCL 0.9 mmol 1 1Sodium hydroxide 0.25 mol 1Procedure 750 P Tris hydrochloride buffer solution, 100 1 sodium salicylate solution, and 100 e salicylate mono oxygenase solution were mixed with 50 e sample solution and incubated at 25 C for 5 minutes. The sample solution was a standard aqueous solution containing a known molar concentration of NADH.To the above reaction mixture, 1.0 ml sodium hydroxide solution and 1.0 ml para aminophenol solution were added with mixing and the solution was retained at room temperature for 3 minutes. The absorbance at 565 nm of the dye produced in this mixture was then read, and the absorbance value plotted on a graph against the known NDH concentration in the original sample. The above procedure was repeated for several further standard sample solutions each containing known but different concentrations of NADH up to a maximum NADH concentration of 6 mmol 1 1 so that a calibration curve of NADH concentration in solution against absorbance was built up. This curve indicated that the assay was linear up to a NADH concentration of 5.0 mmol 1 1 in the original sample solution. 50 P of an aqueous sample solution containing an unknown concentration of NADH was then subjected to the above reaction procedure and its NADH concentration then read from the standardNADH calibration curve. Using the above procedure, accurate estimations of NADH l concentrations up to 5.0 mmol 1 in sample solutions could be made. For samples containing higher concentrations, dilution of the sample stock solutions with known volumes of water was first required before measuring out the sample volume of 50 1. Example 3 Reduced pyridine nucleotide NAD P H estimation Using identical reagents to those of Example 2 above, the procedure of Example 2 was used to build up a standard calibration curve of NAD P H concentration in solution against absorbance linear to 5.0 mmol 1 1 NAD P H using standard aqueous sample solutions each containing known but different concentrations ofNAD P H rather than NADH. 50 P of an aqueous sample solution containing an unknown concentration of NAD P H was then subjected to the above reaction procedure and its NAD P H concentration then read from the standard NAD P H calibration curve.Exanple 4 Reduced pyridine nucleotide NADH estimationReagents all in aqueous solution Salicylate mono oxygenase 20 U ml 1 Sodium salicylate 100 mmolTris hydrochloride, pH 8.2 150 mmol 1 NAD 10 mmol 1 Lactate dehydrogenase EC 1.1.1.27 10 U ml p Aminophenol in 0.1 mol litre l HC1 0.9 mmol 1 1 Sodium hydroxide 0.25 mol 1 Procedure The following procedure was used to estimate lactate concentration in a sample solution via the estimation of NADH. 550 e Tris hydrochloride buffer solution, 100 P salicylate mono oxygenase solution, 100 1 sodium salicylate solution, 100 lactate dehydrogenase solution and 100 rl HAD solution were mixed with 50 P sample solution and incubated at 250C for 10 minutes. The sample solution was a standard aqueous solution containing a known molar concentration of lactate ions. In the foregoing reaction mixture, the NAD was converted to NADH by reaction with the lactate ions in the presence of the lactate dehydrogenase enzyme which acted as a catalyst, and the NADH so produced thus enabled the enzymic conversion of the salicylate ions to catechol to take place in the presence of the salicylate mono oxygenase enzyme.To the above reaction mixture, 1.0 ml sodium hydroxide solution and 1.0 ml para aminophenol solution were added with mixing and the solution was allowed to stand at room temperature for 3 minutes. The absorbance at 565 nm of the dye produced in the mixture was then read, and this absorbance value plotted on a graph against the known lactate molar concentration in the original sample. The above procedure was repeated for several further standard sample solutions each containing different but known concentrations of lactate ions up to a maximum lactate ion concentration of 6 mmol 1 , so that a standard calibration curve of lactate ion molar concentration in solution against absorbance was built up. This curve indicated that the assay was linear up to a lactate concentration of 3.2 mmol 1 in the original sample solution. 50 K of an aqueous solution containing an unknown concentration of lactate ions was subjected to the above reaction procedure, and its lactate ion concentrate then read from the standard lactate calibration curve.Example 5 Reduced pyridine nucleotide NADH estimationReagents all in aqueous solution Salicylate mono oxygenase 20 U ml 1Sodium salicylate 50 mmol 1 ÚTris hydrochloride pH 8.2 150 mmol 1 Ú containing 20 mmol 1 ÚMgC12 ATP containing 10 Uml Ú hexokinase E.C.2.7.1.1 100 mmol 1 ÚNADP 10 mmol 1 Ú Glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase 10 U ml l EC 1.1.1.49 Aminophenol in 0.1 mol litre 1 HCL 0.9 mmol 1 ÚSodium hydroxide 0.25 mol 1 ÚProcedure The following procedure was used to measure glucose concentration in a sample solution via the estimation of NED P H. 50 l samples of aqueous solutions containing known but different concentrations of glucose were mixed with 450 e Tris hydrochloride buffer solution, 100 e ATP solution containing hexokinase, 100 l NAD P solution, 100 e glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase solution, 100 e sodium salicylate solution and 100 e salicylate mono oxygenase solution. These mixtures were incubated at 25 C for 10 minutes. In these reaction mixtures, glucose was converted to glucose 6 phosphate, which reducedNAD P to NAD P H, and the NAD P H so produced enabled the enzymic conversion of salicylateto catechol to occur.To these reaction mixtures, 1.0 ml sodium hydroxide solution and 1.0 ml para aminophenol solution were added, with mixing, and the solutions allowed to stand at room temperature for three minutes. The absorbances at 565 nm of the dye produced in the mixtures were then read, and these absorbance values plotted on a graph against the known glucose concentrations in the original samples. A standard calibration curve of glucose molar concentration against absorbance was thereby built up. The curve indicated that the assay was linear up to a glucose concentration of 5.0 mmol 1 Ú in the original sample. An aqueous solution containing an unknown concentration of glucose was subjected to the above reaction procedure, and its glucose molar concentration then read from the standard glucose calibration curve.Example 6 Salicylate estimationReagents all in aqueous solution Aryl ester hydrolase ÈC 3.1.1.2 20 U ml Salicylate mono oxygenase 20 U mr1 Tris hydrochloride pH 8.2 100 mmol 1 NADH or NAD P H 10 mmol 1 Ú 1itre1 p Aminophenol in 0.1 mol litre Ú HCL 0.9 mmol 1 1 Sodium hydroxide 0.25 mol 1 ÚProcedure The following procedure was used to estimate acetyl salicylate ion concentration in a sample solution via the estimation of salicylate ions. 650 1 potassium phosphate solution, 100 rr3.

In the above reaction mixture, the aryl ester hydrolase enzyme first catalysed the conversion of all the acetyl salicylate ions to salicylate ions, and then the reduced pyridine nucleotide present in excess converted all the salicylate ions so produced to catechol in the presence of salicylate mono oxygenase. To the above reaction mixture, 1.0 ml sodium hydroxide solution and 1.0 ml para aminophenol solution were added with mixing and the solution was retained at room temperature for 3 minutes.The absorbance at 565 nm of the dye produced in the mixture was then read, and this absorbance value plotted on a graph against the known acetyl salicylate ion molar concentration in the original sample solution.
