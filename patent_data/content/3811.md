## Description
Method and plant for the heating and or conditioning of roomsThe invention concerns a method and a plant for the heat ing and or conditioning of rooms, that is to say a new method of heating and or cooling the rooms of buildings of any type equipped with windows or French windows this method being realized by means of a plant, which can be used for the heating and or cooling with, moreover, a pos sibility of adjusting the humidity degree of the rooms1The prior state of art includes a traditional method ac cording to which heating plants are equipped with water or air radiators fitted either in a special space under the window sill or, protruding or not, on walls, ceilings or floors or they are equipped with convectors, that is to say heat exchangers operated by fans the heating or cooling fluid generally comes from a central generator by means of tubes the radiators, sometimes being integrated by humidifiers, being in any case independent from the windows or French windows, except those conditioners inserted in the glass of the window,This prior state of art is susceptible of further improvements having the following aim the increase of the efficiency of the plant compared to a radiation and natural convection plant as well as to a forced air circulation heating plant the increase of the speed of intervention of the heating plant as to the thermic level of the room with regard to both traditional types of plant the increase of the uniformity of distribution of the temperatu re compared to that which may be found in traditional tL pes of plants, the possibility to combine the prerequisi tes of both types of traditional plant and to have the traditional plant work with forced convey icon in certain periods based only on the prerequisites of the radiation and natural convection plant the possibility of pre arranging the locations of the elements of the plant in the wall structure of the building, these elements being suitably devised, prefabricated and normalized in order to obtain the best insulation conditions of the room towards the outside as well as economy of production and installation of the plantFrom what was previously said, derives the necessity of resolving the technical problem to find a method, which consents to associate in a programmable way the speed of intervention on the thermic level of the room, which is typical of those plants equipped with convectors and or conditioners with forced air circulation with the radiation effects and those of natural convection typical of the prints equipped with water radiators such a method having to be carried out by means of a plant installed in such a way that it consents the reciprocal integration of the forced convection heating and or conditioning method with the one with radiation and natural convection, choosing at this aim a new type of ins allation, which permits improvement of the speed of variation of the ter mic level,of the temperature distribution and the efficiency as well as a more rational insulation towards the outside and, advantageously, the adoption of prefabricated plant elements to be inserted into their proper spaces in the masonry economically pre arranged even at the beginning of the construction of the building1The invention resolves the above mentioned technical pro blem by adopting a method, which foresees the aspiration of air from the environment itself in the lower part at the side of a window or a French window as for the forced component of the heating as well as the cooling of the room this air is then to be treated and guided upwards, passed through a heat exchanger with pc. sibly a humidifier and, already treated, let into the environment from above the window or French window the plant, which reali zes such a method, includes mainly a hollow portal shaped like an upturned U, which surrounds and supports the frame of the window or French window recessed in a suita ble niche provided in the masonry, from which it projects into the room that is to be heated and or conditioned ternally it is equipped with at least one fan in at least one of its risers this fan sucks the air through a suction opening in the lower part of the riser moreover it is equipped with at least one heat exchanger situated hig er at the inside of the riser itself, possibly with a humi difier and a distributor of the treated air ending with movable deflectors that can be directed downwards, located in a hollow crosspiece that joins the two risers of the said cable portal at the upside between the upper part of the window frame of Frenall window frame and the said distributor, the winding drum of the rolling shutter can be mounted with its container case and the support, being part of the portal structure at the inside of this structure a thermic insulation is to be arranged towards the outside and at the part of said case, towards the inside, too both risers of the said structure, or only one of them, caneontain the fan, the heat exchanger, the possible humidifier and tubes and or cables of different types necessary in the building because of the projection into the room of the whole hollow structure of the portal, the platforms an ample radiator with a radiating surface shaped like an upturned U, which determines itself the transmission of heat by radiation and natural convection, even if the fan is not running, in the case of use for heating purposes,The advantages obtained by this invention are when heating rooms, the possibility of having the plant work in a limited way at the emission of heat by radiation and by natural convection, maintaining a basic thermic level, which can be increased very quickly, when necessary, or in a program med way, by means of intervention of the fan, which deter mines the forced air convection a greater uniformity and speed of temperature distribution, also because of the up turned U shape oi the radiator portal a higher efficien cy of the plant because of the better utilization of the heat owing to the co existence of the two types of operation and because of a smaller loss of heat towards the utside thanks to the greater rationality of the insulation ohtained by the new type of plant the possibility of using the plant also for the cooling of the room and for the adjustment of the humidity level, which makes use of the plant possible in any climatic conditionOne way of carrying out the invention is illustrated in the three enclosed designs in order to give an example Figure 1 is a front view, interrupted

through the fitting 23 into the vertical heat exchanger 22, possibly equipped with a cell 29 for the humidifier 30, from which it passes through the fitting 35 into the air distribution case, the diaphragms 38 of which guide the treated air into a normal direction to the ptansv of the wall the deflectors 41 direct the air along course inclined downwards at an an gle depending on the depth and purpose of service of the room, thus determining a uniform air circulation with consequent uniform temperature distribution it Is intended for heating purposes, that a natural air circulation can be obtained, when the heat exchanger is running, depending on the length of the rising tubular column forming the ver tical part of the course of the air thus the fan 24 has to intervene only in case of necessity by means of a manual control or a thermostat or by means of a proper adjusting device of the temperature with a programme according to the hours of the day and the rooms themselves, permitting to maintain a temperature of 15 160C in the absence of persons by means of radiation or natural convection, which can rather quickly be increased by intervention of the fan 24, which consequently means a considerable saving of energy.In the practical realization, the metal materials forming the elements of the portal and the plant, with the exception of the insulating materials, can be chosen according to the special, also aesthetical, requirements the same is true also for the straight line sections of the portal risers, which, moreover, must meet also tlie requirements of good ra diation and good natural convection of the heat in the envi ronmentg Moreover, the plant might present modifications, such as, for instance, the following the tube 42 of the right hand riser might be eliminated to give way to a treating device like the one in the left hand riser moreover, the tube 42 might remain at its place even in case of a repetition of fhe treatment device in the right hand riser, it might even be added in the left hand riser, as it is foreseen that the diaphragms 38 are distributed in two specularly simmetrical formations in the case of double suction further, the heat exchanger 22 might be of any suitable type and the opening 25 might be in the front instead of being located at an inwardly inclined side, or, in case of a window with sill, it might even be located in a cross element,For aesthetical reasons, it is also foreseen, that it is sufficient in a room with two or more windows or French windows to use only one of them for the treatment of the air in the room, whilst the other one or the other ones are installed of the same type but without inside plantMoreover, it is foreseen, that the method and the plant can be applied also to doors and windows without rolling shutters, which means an evident simplification and the elimination of the winding drum of the rolling shutter 7, of its container case, of the guide pair 59 and of the belt 12 this permits moreover to decrease the encumberment and to increase the span of the windows and French windowsFinally, the portal should obviously be equipped with more than two active or inactive risers in the case of two or more windows or French windows1
