# Inserter for vaginal product.

## Abstract
An apparatus for safely and reliably inserting a generally hemispherically shaped cervix covering vaginal product. The vaginal product is folded upon itself and fitted, while in the folded condition, into the inserter so that an indicating means 30 on the inserter will reveal the position of the folded vaginal product in vivo. The vaginal product is discharged from the inserter by squeezing the bulb at the end of the handle, thereby inverting a diaphragm 7 located at the opposite end of the inserter and discharging the vaginal product from the inserter while oriented so as to cover the cervix.
