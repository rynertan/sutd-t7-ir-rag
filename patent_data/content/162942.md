# A semiconductor device for detecting electromagnetic radiation or particles.

## Abstract
A semiconductor device of the doping superlattice type for detecting electromagnetic radiation or particles com prises a semi insulating substrate 10 , a first layer 11 of either n type or p type conductivity deposited thereon, a plurality of layers 12, 13, 14 of alternating conductivity types deposited in series on said first layer 11 , a strongly P type electrode region which extends through said p type and n type layers 11, 12, 13, 14 , and defines a first selective electrode 15 , and a strongly n type electrode region which also extends through said p type and n type layers 11, 12, 13, 14 , and which is spaced apart from said strongly p type region and defines a second selective electrode. The device is a homogeneous semiconductor in which the n type and p type layers other than the first layer 11 and the outermost layer 14 have substantially identical doping densities. The first layer 11 and the outermost layer 14 are of the same conductivity type and have a thickness substantially equal to one half of the thickness of each of the other layers 12, 13 . Furthermore, the first layer and the outermost layer have a doping density have a doping density substantially identical to one half of the doping density of the other layers. This makes it possible to completely deplete the entire structure thus a high reverse bias can be applied to the device thereby tilting the resultant electric field with respect to the layers. A device of this kind is particularly suited for use as an optical detector in the infrared wavelength region around 1 Âµm and longer. The device has low dark current at room tempera ture, a very small capacitance and therefore a fast response time.
