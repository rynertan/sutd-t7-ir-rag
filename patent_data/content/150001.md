# Binary data conversion method.

## Abstract
In a method of converting a picture signal read out by an image sensor into a binary data, the picture signal is converted into a primary delayed signal through a primary delay circuit and the primary delayed signal is then con verted into a secondary converted signal through a secon dary delay circuit.

## Description
BINARY DATA CONVERSION METHOD BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a method for converting a picture signal generated from an image sensor into binary data. Documents such as letters or drawings are not usually possessed of half tones, so that picture signal obtained by scanning the documents with the image sensor composed of such as a charge coupled device is processed as a digital signal to sufficiently represent a picture information and the processes thereafter are easily to be performed. For the reason described above, there have been proposed several binary data conversion methods in which a threshold is set to the picture signal and the picture signal is then converted into the binary data. For example, in a case where the scanning S S is applied to a picture image 10 such as shown in FIG.1A by the image sensor, an ideal binarily converted signal of the picture image 10 should be represented by an output wave shown in FIG. 1B. However, an output picture signal VS actually obtained by the image sensor is represented by an output wave as shown inFIG. lC that is, the output picture signal VS actually obtained by the image sensor is widely varied because of the delay in response of the image sensor itself and the density variations of the picture image 10 based on the scanning width W. FIGS. 1D, 1E and 1F represent respectively the results converted binarily by setting constant thresholds TH1, TH2 and TH3 to the picture signal VS as shown in FIG. 1C, but these results shown in FIGS. 1D, 1E and 1F are not satisfied as is apparent from the comparison with the correct binary signal shown in FIG. 1B.Furthermore, FIGS. 1J and 1K show the results obtained by binarily converting the same picture signal VS by setting a pair of upper and lower thresholds TH4 and TH5 as shown in FIG. lH, and as observed in FIGS. 1J and lH, only the portionsA and C of the picture signal VS are correctly binarilyconverted by the thresholds TH4 and onl the portionB is correctly binarily converted by the threshold TH5, respectively, thus being not satisfied. FIG. 2 shows an analogous wave generating circuit consisting of a pair of parallelly connected diodes D1 and D2 and a capacitor C. The picture signal VS as described above is inputted into the analogous wave generating circuit to obtain an analogous signal TH6 which is then used as a threshold signal for converting the picture signal VS into the binary data as shown inFIG. 3A. FIG. 3B shows the result of this binary conversion in which a signal drop LK is observed after the crossing portion provided with high density of the picture image 10. This signal drop LK causes, for example, a correct letter T shown in FIG. 4A to be a defective letter shown in FIG. 4B. FIG. 5 shows a threshold generating circuit comprising a delay circuit 1 and a lower limiter 2 lower limit value LB and when the picture signal VS is inputted into the threshold generating circuit to generate a threshold signal TH7 which is then used as a threshold signal for converting the picture signal VS into the binary data as shown in FIG. 6A, the result of this binary conversion is represented in FIG. 6B. In this case, the threshold TH7 becomes larger than the picture signal VS after the crossing portion 11 thereof, so that the signal drop LK is also observed as described hereinbefore. FIG. 7 also shows a circuit diagram for carrying out the binary conversion in accordance with a method of prior art, and in this circuit diagram, the picture signal VS is inputted into a selector 5 as a secondary delayed signal DEL2 through the primary and secondary delay circuits 3 and 4 and is also directly inputted into the selector 5. In the selector 5, either the secondary delayed signal DEL2 or the picture signal VS, which is larger than the other one, is selected, and thereafter, the selected one signal is inputted into the threshold circuit 7 as a threshold TH8 through a lower limiter 6 lower limit value LB . In the threshold circuit 7, since the primary delayed signal DEL1 has been preliminarily inputted from the primary delay circuit 3, the threshold circuit 7 then generates a binarily converted signal OUT1 with respect to the threshold TH8. With the circuit arrangement shown in FIG. 7, either the picture signal VS or the secondary delayed signal DEL2, which is larger than the other one, becomes the threshold TH8 of a level larger than the lower limit value LB as shown in FIG. 8. However, in a case where the picture signal VS representing the picture image 10 shown in FIG. 1A is inputted into the binarily converting circuit and the primary delayed signal DEL1 is binarily converted as shown in FIG. 9A with the threshold TH8, the signal drops LK1 and LK2 are observed in the front and the rear postions of the crossing portion 11 of the picture image. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of this invention is to eliminate defects or problems in a prior art and to provide an improved binary data conversion method capable of correctly binarily converting a picture signal representing the crossing portion of the picture image with a high density. For achieving this object, according to this invention, there is provided an improved method for converting a picture signal read out by an image sensor into a binary data and the method is characterized in that the picture signal from the image sensor is converted into a primary delayed signal, the primary delayed signal is then converted into a secondary delayed signal, either the picture signal or the secondary delayed signal, which has a level smaller than that of the other one, is selected, the upper and lower levels of the thus selected signal are limited, and the picture signal is binarily converted by utilizing the this limited signal as a threshold with respect to the primary delayed signal. According to the binary data conversion method of this invention, the binary conversion of a picture signal, particularly representing the crossing portion of a picture image, can be sufficiently and correctly performed without adversely affecting the binary conversion of the other portions of the picture image in use of a relatively simple circuit means. The nature, principle and utility of the invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description.when read in conjunction with the accompany ing drawings.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT The preferred embodiment according to this invention will be described hereunder in conjunction withFIGS. 10 through 12. FIG. 10 shows a circuit diagram for carrying out the method of this invention in connection with the circuit diagram shoWn in FIG. 7. In FIG. 10, picture signal VS from an image sensor is inputted into a delay circuit 3 and also into a selector 5A which selectively outputs a signal having a small signal level.A primary delayed signal DEL1 which is delayed for a predetermined time by the delay circuit 3 or delayed by predetermined picture elements of the image sensor by the picture signal VS is inputted into another delay circuit 4 and also into a threshold circuit 7. A secondary delayed signal DEL2 which is further delayed from the primary delayed signal DEL2 for a predetermined time by the delay circuit 4 or delayed by predetermined picture elements of the image sensor is inputted into the selector 5A. The selector 5A operates to compare the signal level of the inputted picture signal VS with that of the secondary defflaed signalDEL2 and also operates to select one of these signals which has a small signal level, and to input it into an upper lower limiter 6A.Into the upper lower limiter 6A are preliminarily inputted from a setting device, not shown, signals representing the upper limit level UB and lower limit level LB, respectively, which are set Sc as to eliminate background noises of the picture image and unevenness of the sensitivity of the image sensor. The selected output signal from the selector 5A is limited within the level range to be determined by the upper and lower levels UB and LB thereby to obtain a threshold TH which is then inputted into the threshold circuit 7. The primary delayed signal DEL1 is binarily converted into the threshold circuit 7 in accordance with the threshold TH and then outputted as a binary signal OUT. In use of the circuit shown in FIG. 10 with respect to the picture signal VS, for example, shown in FIG. 11, the primary delayed signal DELl is shown by dash lines because the signal DEL1 is delayed for a predetermined time or by predetermined picture elements of the image sensor, while the secondary delayed signalDEL2 is shown by dot and dash lines because the signalDEL2 is delayed for a further predetermined time or by further predetermined picture elements of the image sensor. With respect to these signals VS and DEL2, the selector 5A selects and outputs the signal having a small signal level, and the high and low level portions of the thus selected signal are limited by the limiter 6A to the upper and lower limit levels UB andLB to thereby exhibit the threshold TH.According to the manner described above, the threshold TH is represented by the signal surrounded by a fine solid line in FIG. 11. As can be understood from one example described above, the threshold TH is positioned in mcny portions at the level lower than the primary delayed signal DEL1, whereas the threshold TH is positioned at the level higher than the primary delayed signal DEL1 only in the case I where the delayed signalDELl exists in an area having a level lower than that of the lower limit level LB or in the case II where the primary delayed signal DEL1 exists in an area in which the signal DEL1 varies from its decreasing state to its increasing state within the ranges of the upper and lower limit levels UB and LB. Accordingly, the relationship between the primary delayed signal DEL1 and the threshold TH in a case where the picture signal VS as shown in FIG. 1A is, for example, inputted into the circuit shown in FIG. 10 is represented in FIG. 12A, and only in the cases I andII, the threshold TH has a level higher than that of the primary delayed signal DEL1, and in the other cases, the threshold TH has a level lower than that of the signal DEL1 even at the crossing position 11 of the picture image. For the reason mentioned above, the result of the binary conversion of the primary delayed signal DEL1 by means of the threshold TH somewhat tends to have a wide picture as shown in FIG. 12B, but the binary signal can be always correctly outputted. This fact will be understood in comparison with the ideal binarily converted output shown in FIG. 1B. As described hereinabove, according to this invention, the binary conversion of a picture signal read out by an image sensor can be correctly performed particularly with respect to the crossing portion of a picture image with no signal drop without adversely affecting the binary conversion of the other portions of the picture image. This binary conversion can be done by a relatively simple circuit means, which involves no cost up there for It should be understood that many modifications and adaptations of the invention will become apparent to rose skilled in the art and it is irtended to encompass such obvious modifications and change in the scope of the claims appended hereto.
