# Data transfer apparatus for use with a flexible magnetic disk or the like.

## Abstract
A data transfer apparatus is disclosed as typified by a floppy disk drive which, together with one or more like devices, is daisy chained to host equipment comprising a central processor unit and an associated controller. Each disk drive comprises a disk motor 20 for rotating a record disk 18 unter the control of a disk motor drive circuit 46 , a head motor 26 for incrementally moving a transducer head 22 radially of the record disk under the control of a head motor drive circuit 52 , and a read write circuit 64 for processing data read from, or to be written on, the record disk via the transducer head 22 . The host equipment produces, among other control signals, a MOTOR ON signal for the on off control of the disk motor via the disk motor drive circuit 46 . In order to avoid waste of electric power, not only the disk motor drive circuit 46 but also at least either, preverably both, of the head motor drive circuit 52 and the read wirte circuit 64 is connected to a common power line via a power control switch 100 which is closed only when the MOTOR ON signal is in a prescribed state to cause rotation of the disk motor.
