# Radiolabeled technetium chelates for use in renal function determinations.

## Abstract
The present invention is directed to novel radiophar maceutical imaging agents incorporating Tc 99m as a radio label. In particular, the novel imaging agents disclosed herein have relatively high renal extraction efficiencies, and hence are useful for conducting renal function imaging procedures. The novel Tc 99m compounds of a present invention have the following general formula
