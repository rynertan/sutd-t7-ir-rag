# ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION DETECTOR

## Abstract
The electromagnetic radiation sensitive detector com prises a substrate 10 , a first layer 12 on the substrate of radiation sensitive semiconductor material of a given conduc tivity type and having a first energy bandgap, at least one ohmic contact 16 providing electrical communication with the first layer, and a second layer 14 of semiconductor material of the same conductivity type as the first layer but having an energy bandgap greater than that of the first layer, the second layer being located on the first layer 12 beneath the or each contact 16 to which minority carriers are attracted from the first layer to enhance the responsivity of the detector.
