## Description
Antistatic agent for synthetic high molecular weight polymer materials This invention relates to an antistatic agent for synthetic high molecular weight polymer materials.More particularly it relates to an internal addition type anti static agent for synthetic high molecular weight polymer materials, which comprises as an important component, one kind or two kinds or more selected from among anionic surfactants having a sulfoacetate group. Synthetic high molecular weight polymer materials usually have as their specific characteristic, a very hydrophobic property, and their easily charging property resulting therefrom has constituted a serious obstacle to the production process of the materials as well as the use of products prepared from the materials. Namely, in the production process of plastic molded products, films and synthetic fibers using synthetic high molecular weight polymer materials, static electricity is generated by contacting friction of the materials with each other and their friction with production apparatus, resulting in hindrance to smooth operations or degradation of the quality of products. Further, these products are difficult to avoid undesirable phenomena such as attachment of dusts at the time of their storage, etc.static shock at the time of their use, and their easily charging property often constitutes a fatal defect to their uses. Heretofore, various processes have been proposed for alleviating the obstacles due to the charging property of synthetic high molecular weight polymer materials. As one of these processes, there is a process of attaching a substance having an anti static property, mainly a surfactant, onto the surface of synthetic high molecular weight polymer materials, but although this process is simple, it has a drawback that its effectiveness is only temporary.Further, in order to overcome this drawback, a process of fixing a high molecular weight polymer substance onto their surface and a process of reacting a considerable amount of a reactive compound with the surface of the materials have been proposed, but the amount of these substances used is generally large and as a result, good surface characteristics intrinsic of synthetic high molecular weight polymer materials are liable to be harmed. Further, as another process, there is a process of blending a substance having an antistatic property with synthetic high molecular weight polymer materials to thereby improve their properties. According to this process, the durability of the effectiveness is superior to those according to the above mentioned processes, but as far as the use of the substance is concerned, since it has already been contained in synthetic high molecular weight polymer materials as a portion thereof in the production process of molded products, films and synthetic fibers, it is necessary for the additive to satisfy a higher extent of characteristics required.For example, according to this process, various problems are liable to be raised such as coloring of the materials due to heating in the production process reduction in the mechanical characteristics of the materials such as strength, hardness, etc. due to blending reduction in transparency due to insufficient compatibility of the additive with synthetic high molecular weight polymer materials increase in adherence of the surface of the high molecular weight polymer materials due to bleed out of the additive etc. hence on the contrary, the intrinsic superior characteristics of synthetic high molecular weight polymer materials are liable to be harmed.And as main additives proposed in this process, various surfactants have been known. Many of nonionic surfactants are generally superior in the compatibility with synthetic high molecular weight polymer materials to ionic surfactants, but their anti static property is not sufficient so that it is necessary to blend it in a large amount in order to obtain a sufficient effectiveness. This is liable to bring about degradation of physical properties intrinsic of synthetic high molecular weight polymer materials as well as troubles in the production process. On the other hand, many of ionic surfactants are generally inferior in the compatibility with synthetic high molecular weight polymer materials and hence difficult to disperse uniformly therein.Further, cationic or amphoteric surfactants having a quartanary nitrogen in the molecule, although usually superior in the antistatic effectiveness, are liable to cause coloring when heated hence they are insufficient at the time of their actual use. Thus it is the present status that anti static agents which are usable for commercial production and sufficiently satisfactory are now not found. In view of the above mentioned status, the present inventors have made strenuous studies in order to obtain an internal addition type anti static agent for synthetic high molecular weight polymer materials, which are superior in the anti static property and have overcome the above mentioned various drawbacks, and as a result have attained the present invention. The present invention is directed to an internal addition type anti static agent for synthetic high molecular weight polymer materials, which is characterized by comprising as an important component, one kind or two kinds or more selected from among anionic surfactants containing a sulfoacetate group and expressed by the following general formula A OCCH2S03M wherein A RlO CmH2mO a, R2O CmH2mO b CnH2nO c and R3O CmH2mO d CnH2nO e wherein CmH2mO d CnH2nO e represents a random copolymer of monomers CmH2mO and CnH2nO R1 R3 alkyl of 4 22 carbon atoms, alkenyl of 8 22 carbon atoms or EMI6.1 R4 R5 H, alkyl of 1 18 carbon atoms, phenyl, styryl, benzyl or benzylphenyl a an integer of 0 20 b, c, d, e an integer of 1 20 m, n an integer of 2 4 but m is not equal to n M alkali metal. According to the present invention, a superior antistatic effectiveness can be obtained by having one kind or two kinds or more selected from among anionic surfactants having a sulfoacetate group and expressed by the above mentioned general formula which surfactants will hereinafter be referred to as anionic surfactant , contained in synthetic high molecular weight polymer materials, and the anionic surfactants expressed by the general formula are prepared e.g. by the following method as in the method of the invention of Japanese patent No.489729 First, an organic compound having one active hydroxyl group in the molecule and monochloroacetic acid in a nearly equimolecular amount to that of the former are subjected to esterification reaction using an acid catalyst in the presence of an organic solvent having no active hydrogen or in the absence of solvent.Next, the catalyst is inactivated by neutralization, or the catalytic performance is removed by removing it, and in the case where an organic solvent is present, the solvent is distilled off, followed by rendering the solvent system a water isopropanol mixed solvent system, adding a nearly equimolecular amount of sodium sulfite and completing sulfonation reaction under reflux. If necessary, byproduced NaCQ or unreacted material is removed, and as a method for this removal, it is advantageous to carry out extraction with a single organic solvent or a mixture system of a plurality of organic solvents, taking into account the solubility of product. Examples of the organic compound having one active hydroxyl group in the molecule, used in the preparation of the anionic surfactants of the present invention are monohydric aliphatic alcohols, alkylene oxide addition products thereof, alkylene oxide addition products of phenol and phenol derivatives. It is possible for them to optionally choice the carbon number of alkyl or alkyl chain, kind of alkylene oxide, the number of addition mols, and the addition form in accordance with objects, and they have an advantage that it is possible to broadly adjust properties such as antistatic property, compatibility with synthetic high molecular weight polymer materials, etc. to the condition to which they are applied, and particularly their characteristics are very advantageous to the condition needing transparency.Examples of monohydric aliphatic alcohols as one of raw materials of the anionic surfactants of the present invention are butanol, octanol, decyl alcohol, lauryl alcohol, cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, oleyl alcohol, isotridecyl alcohol, isohexadecyl alcohol, isostearyl alcohol, etc.Further, examples of phenol derivatives are t butylphenol, octylphenol, nonylphenol, dodecylphenol, octadecylphenol, dinonylphenol, phenylphenol, benzylphenol, styrylphenol, benzylphenylphenol, etc., but they are not limited to these examples in the present invention. As the alkylene oxide which forms an alkylene oxide addition product together with a monovalent hydroxyl group compound as in the abovementioned examples, ethylene oxide, propylene oxide and butylene oxide are used, and among these, any of an addition form using one kind, a block copolymerization type addition form and a random copolymerization type addition form using two kinds or more may be applied to the present invention.In the alkylene oxide addition product applicable to the present invention, the number of mols of alkylene oxide greatly varies depending on various conditions such as synthetic high molecular weight polymer materials applied, the chemical structure of monovalent hydroxyl group compound, etc., but a preferable range for making the most of the anti static property of the sulfoacetate group is about up to 20 mols in the case where a single alkylene oxide is used, while up to about 20 mols of each alkylene oxide in the case where two kinds or more of alkylene oxides are used to add in a block type or random type manner. Further, as ions as a counterpart of sulfonic acid, alkali metals are preferable in order to display the antistatic property. Concretely potassium, sodium and lithium are preferable. In carrying out the present invention, one kind or two kinds or more selected properly from among anionic surfactants expressed by the above mentioned general formula are used depending on the kind and object of synthetic high molecular weight polymer materials used, but the time when and the method by which the anionic surfactants are added to the synthetic high molecular weight polymer materials, are not particularly limited in the present invention, and it is possible to add them at any of a stage where they are added to monomer of synthetic high molecular weight polymer materials, a midway stage during the polymerization, a stage where they are added to polymer after completion of polymerization, and the like stages, and it is preferred to employ a time and a method which are commercially most advantageous in the aspect of practical use.Further, the amount of the surfactants used is preferably in the range of 0.2 to 5 by weight, more preferably in the range of 0.3 to 3 by weight. In carrying out the present invention, it does not matter if other components are added for other purposes as far as this does not harm the effectiveness of the present invention. For example, stabilizers such as antioxidant, ultraviolet absorbing agent, etc., surfactants for improving dispersibility, etc. are used, and besides, various organic or inorganic compounds are added for various purposes to synthetic high molecular weight polymer materials used for producing plastic molded products, films, and synthetic fibers. The synthetic high molecular weight polymer materials to which the present invention is applied have no particular limitation, but the present invention is effectively applicable to polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride, polymethyl methacrylate, polyesters, polyamides, etc. The present invention will be further described by way of Examples and also its effectiveness will be mentioned, but the present invention is not limited thereby.Example 1 Nonylphenol ethylene oxide 10 mols addition product 0.5 mol , monochloroacetic acid 0.5 mol and conc. sulfuric acid 0.5 by weight based on the above mentioned raw materials were added into a 1 capacity four neck flask connected to a vacuum line consisting of a vacuum pump and a condenser.The contents were heated up to 1100C and esterification was completed under reduced pressure in 3 hours, followed by cooling the contents down to room temperature, neutralizing with 5 NaOH in an equivalent amount to catalyst neutralization, and transferring into a 2 t capacity flask equipped with an agitator, a thermometer and a reflux condenser. To the contents were then isopropanol in an equal amount to that of the contents, water in an amount of three times that thereof and sodium sulfite 0.5 mol , and sulfornation reaction was completed under reflux in 4 hours.Isopropanol was distilled off from the contents as much as possible under the atmospheric pressure, followed by adding xylene in an amount of 1.5 times the amount of the resulting sulfonate compound i.e.anionic surfactant, distilling off remaining water and isopropanol, filtering off precipitated inorganic substance, and distilling off xylene under reduced pressure. The resulting sulfonate compound 3 parts by weight and polymethyl methacrylate 97 parts by weight were neaded for 5 minutes in a Laboplastic mill manufactured by Toyo Seiki Co. Japan and the resulting mixture was molded at 1900C by means of a hot press manufactured by Toyo Seiki Co. to obtain a sheet of 2 mm thick.Examples 2 7 Sheets were obtained in the same manner as inExample 1, using sulfonate compounds prepared in almost the same manner as in Example 1 and indicated in the following Table, and also using high molecular weight polymer compounds indicated in the Table.Comparative examples 1 6 For comparison s sake, sheets of high molecular weight polymer compounds used in Examples but containing no additive, and sheets thereof containing conventional additives were prepared and subjected to measurements.
