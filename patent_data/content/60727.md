# Throttle operated controller assembly.

## Abstract
A switch assembly 10 adapted for actuation by con nection to an engine throttle shaft. The switch housing is adapted for mounting on an engine and has a rotary cam 24 received therein having a socket 36 for connection to the engine throttle shaft. Rotation of the cam sequentially actuates a plurality of electrical switches 64, 106 . The housing has a stationary 20 and movable member 14 with some of the switches mounted on each. A helical screw 110 engages teeth on the movable member and for adjust ing the relative position between the housing members. The screw is readily accessible from the exterior of the housing and rotation of the screw adjusts the at rest position of the cam with respect to the switches for enabling easy calibra tion after installation on the engine.
