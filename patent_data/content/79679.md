# Process for separating highly pure butene 1 and butene 2.

## Abstract
A process for separating highly pure butene 2 and butene 1 from a C₄ hydrocarbon fraction containing isobu tane, n butane, butene 1, butene 2, and at least one diolefinic hydrocarbon and or at least one acetylenic hydrocarbon, which comprises 1 as a step A, treating the C₄ hydrocarbon fraction with a polar solvent to separate it into a raffinate containing isobutane and n butane and an extract containing butene 1, butene 2, the diolefinic hydrocarbon and or the acetylenic hydrocarbon, 2 as a step B, introducing the extract from step A into a first distillation column to obtain a fraction containing butene 1, the olefinic hydrocarbon and or the acetylenic hydrocarbon and purified butene 2, 3 as a step C, introducing the fraction obtained in step B into a second extractive distillation column and treating it with a polar solvent to separate it into a raffinate containing butene 1 and an extract containing the diolefinic hydrocar bon and or the acetylenic hydrocarbon, or 2 as a step B, introducing the extract from step A into a second extractive distillation column and treating it with a polar solvent to separate it into a raffinate containing butene 1 and butene 2 and an extract containing the diolefinic hydrocarbon and or the acetylenic hydrocarbon, 3 as a step C, introducing the raffinate from the step B into a first distillation column to obtain butene 1 and purified butene 2, and 4 as a step D, introducing the raffinate or butene 1 obtained in step C into a second distillation column to remove a tiny amount of water and obtain purified butene 1.
