# Roofing and siding members.

## Abstract
An integrally fabricated roofing or siding panel of polyurethane foam, and a roofing or siding system of such panels. The panels have longitudinally alternating overlap ping and backset simulated shingle patterns, along with matingly cooperative transverse mounting arrangements so that an aggregation of such panels presents the appearance of an ordinary roof. Fly ash is used as a filler in the polyurethane foam mix to improve the structure s fire retardancy, its dimensional stability, and its economy.

## Description
ROOFING AND SIDING MEMBERS This invention relates to roofing and siding members. DESCRIPTION OF PRIOR ART Roofing and siding materials of various types are of widespread familiarity. Asphalt composition shingles find common usage, largely because they are relatively inexpensive. Wood shingles and shakes, and, in many communities, clay tiles, are very popular owing to their asthetic appeal. However, the labour required to install each of these varieties is often as or more expensive than the material costs because each single, shake, or tile must be individually applied to the roof.Similarly, wood sidings and the like require individual application of each course to the side of the building. Although wood shingles and shakes are quite attractive, they present so great a fire hazard that authorities in many communities now limit or prohibit their usage. Furthermore, in times of increasing concern with regard to energy conservation, traditional roofing and siding materials offer little insulative guality to the structures in which they are used. Exemplary of the development of roofing and siding structures over a number of years are the following inventions U.S. Patent No. 337,310, which issued on March 2, 1886, to J W Crabbe, discloses siding and roofing with two rabbets cut into each end. Each pair of rabbets is cut on opposite sides of the board when it is used for roofing, whereas each pair of rabbets is cut on the same side of the board when it is used for vertical siding. The weatherboarding of U.S. Patent No. 1,492,190, which issued to W. E. Aycock on April 29, 1924, is tapered and has two rabbets in its upper or thicker area so that the weatherboard above rests in the upper of those rabbets. In the composition shingle construction taught in U.S. Patent No. 1,800,403, which issued to H E Pfaff, et al on April 14, 1931 each shingle is equipped on its lower edge with a flange which overlaps the upper area of the shingle immediately below. U.S. Patent No. 2,078,039, which issued toP Stoner on April 20, 1937, discloses siding with a single rabbet on its thinner upper edge and a plurality of rabbets on the thicker lower edge. This patent also discloses mating grooves and protrusions in the bevelled faces to facilitate sealing. U.S. Patent No. 2,452,054, which issued onOctober 26, 1948, to Grinnel Jones, et al, discloses a fire retardant composition, designed to be applied as a reactive surface coating to combustible and non combustible materials. While the structures discussed above have their own attributes, each is found wanting in terms of expense of labour required for installation, and lack of fire retardancy and insulative properties. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is to those desirable attributes of ease of installation, fire retardancy, and insulative quality that at least preferred embodiments of the present invention is directed. In one embodiment, a panel is provided with a simulated shingle or siding pattern on its upper surface.This pattern has the appearance and the dimensions of a plurality of courses of shingles or siding of whichever common variety is being imitated. The pattern overhangs one edge of the panel, and is backset on the opposite edge so that when two panels are placed side by side, a continuous array of shingles or siding is presented.Panels are connected to each other above and below by means of matingly receptive surfaces at the upper and lower edges. Similarly constructed starter panels and ridge row members are used to complete the entire roofing or siding assembly. The members of this system are made of polyurethane foam, with the surface of each member having applied to it, for purposes of fire retardancy, paint containing a silicon coated phosphate. To further enhance the fire retardancy, the cost, and the shrinkage characteristics of the panels, a filler of fly ash is used in the foam mix. It is, therefore, an object of at least preferred embodiments of the present invention to provide a roofing or siding member entailing a plurality of courses of a simulated roofing or siding pattern. Another object of at least preferred embodiments of the present invention is to provide a roofing or siding system requiring less labour to install than traditional roofing or siding systems. Yet another object of at least preferred embodiments of the present invention is the provision of a fire retardant roofing or siding member. A further object of at least preferred embodiments of the present invention is the provision of a roofing or siding member having enhanced insulative characteristics. A still further object of at least preferred embodiments of the present invention is to provide a polyurethane foam roofing or siding member which is economical and commercially feasible to produce. For a better understanding of the invention reference will now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a perspective view of two longitudinally adjacent roofing or siding shingle panels of the present invention, with one such panel being rotated and spaced longitudinally apart from the first panel and with said panels being shown in placement relative to starter panels therebelow Figure 2 is a cross sectional view of a panel taken along lines 2 2 of Figure 1 Figure 3 is a cross sectional view of a starter panel taken along lines 3 3 of Figure 1 Figure 4 is a cross sectional view of a roofing or siding shingle arrangement of the present invention illustrating the interconnecting relationship of the various members thereof and Figure 5 is a cross sectional view, taken along lines 5 5 of Figure 4, of the area near the apex of a roofing system of the present invention, illustrating the structure and interconnecting relationship of the ridge row members. Referring to the drawings, the reference numeral 10 designates a roofing panel of the present invention.Although a roofing structure is particularly illustrated in Figures 1 5, and although the description herein refers particularly to the embodiments of the present invention as incorporated into a roofing system, it is nevertheless apparent that the invention is equally adaptable to siding panels and to a siding system. Roofing panel 10 is preferably constructed of polyurethane foam and may be manufactured from any of a number of foam mixes, all of which are well known in the industry, such as that marketed under the trademark COROFOAM. Also, and as will be discussed in greater detail below, panel 10 may be constructed of foam having certain new and beneficial properties. Roofing panel 10 is provided generally with upper and lower surfaces 11 and 12, first and second transverse edges 13 and 14, and top and bottom longitudinal edges 15 and 16. Upper surface 10 has thereon a simulated shingle pattern, preferably having the appearance and dimensions of a plurality of courses of shingles. It may, of course, be constructed in the fashion of any desired roofing or siding pattern, including, but not limited to, simulated courses of clay tile roofing and lapboard siding. The particular simulation illustrated in Figure 1 is that of wood shingles. The simulated shingle pattern on upper surface 11 preferably encompasses the major portion of that surface. In the area of the second transverse edge 14, however, the shingle pattern longitudinally overhangs that edge. On the other hand, in the area of the first transverse edge 13, the shingle pattern is longitudinally backset a substantially equal distance. On the upper surface 11 and in the area of the top longitudinal edge 15 is situated an upper mounting arrangement, generally depicted in Figure 1 by the reference numeral 19. Upper mounting arrangement 19 includes thereon a relatively substantial upper mounting shelf 20, as shown, between the simulated shingle pattern and the top longitudinal edge 15. On the lower surface 12 and in the area of the bottom longitudinal edge 16 is situated a corresponding lower mounting arrangement 21. Lower mounting arrangement 21 includes thereon a lower mounting shelf 22 so that when the lower mounting shelf 22 of one such panel is placed above the upper mounting shelf 20 of the panel transversely adjacent thereto, the shelves 20 and 22 are matingly receptive to each other. In developing the system described herein, it was an objective to provide an appropriate first, or starter, panel. This is accomplished by the starter panel denoted generally by reference numeral 40 in Figures 1, 3 and 4. Like roofing panel 10, starter panel 40 has upper and lower surfaces 41 and 42, first and second transverse edges 43 and 44, and top and bottom longitudinal edges 45 and 46. Also, a simulated shingle pattern encompasses the major portion of upper surface 41. An upper mounting arrangement 49, including an upper mounting shelf 50, is also constructed in the same fashion as the upper mounting arrangement 19 and upper mounting shelf 20 on roofing panel 10. However, in order to provide the appearance of an ordinary roof, the structure of starter panel 40 in the area of its bottom longitudinal edge 16 is altered so that the lower course of starter panel 40 appears to be mounted atop a starter strip. This is accomplished by forming, in the vicinity of bottom longitudinal edge 46, starter indention 54 in the manner illustrated in Figures 1 and 3. To install a system composed of starter panels 40 and roofing panels 10, one begins by attaching to the roof decking 25 or rafters, in the vicinity of its lower edge, a series of longitudinally adjacent starter panels 40 so that the first transverse edge 43 of each abuts the second transverse edge 44 of the starter panel adjacent thereto, so as to form a complete starter course on the surface being roofed. Attachment to the decking 25 can be accomplished by nails, staples, or other ordinary fastener means 53, through the upper mounting shelf 50, as indicated in Figure 4. The next step in the installation procedure involves the application of consecutive courses of transversely adjacent roofing panels 10. The first course of such panels 10 are attached to the starter panels 40 by bringing the lower mounting shelf 22 of panel 10 into mated relationship with the upper mounting shelf of the starter panel 40 immediately transversely adjacent. This asembly is connected to the decking 25 by nails, staples, or other fastener means 53 driven through the upper mounting arrangement 19 of panel 10. In this manner the starter panel 40 and the roofing panel 10 thereabove form a roofing structure having the appearance and dimension of a plurality of courses of shingles.In fact, by installation of a course of starter panels 40, followed by a course of roofing panels 10, one can apply the equivalent of several courses of conventional roofing in significantly less time, thereby saving considerably on the cost of labour. Application of additional courses of roofing panels 10, as needed, is made in like manner, with each such course being transversely adjacent the previous one therebelow, towards the apex of the roof surface, all as illustrated in Figure 4. It is most often the case that the top longitudinal edge 15 of the uppermost course will not approximate the apex of the roof. In such instances, however, as shown in Figure 4, the uppermost panels 10 may be severed as needed without detriment to the system. A ridge row may be constructed of polyurethane foam members to cover the apex of the roof, with said ridge row being constructed so that any particular member thereof straddles the . apex and covers the uppermost portion of the panels 10 on both sides of the apex.However, because of varying slopes found on the roofs to which the system may be applied, we have found it advantageous to construct ridge row members 30 in the manner described below and illustrated in Figures 4 and 5. Ridge row members 30 each have upper and lower surfaces 31 and 32, first and second transverse edges 33 and 34, and top and bottom longitudinal edges 35 and 36.Top longitudinal edges 35 are formed at the appropriate angle from the upper and lower surfaces 31 and 32, which angle varies according to the roof slope, so as to form a substantially mated juncture above the roof apex, as illustrated in Figure 4. In a fashion similar to roofing panel 10, ridge row member 30 has, in the vicinity of its first transverse edge 33, right hand mounting arrangement 68, including right hand mounting shelf 69, as shown.Correspondingly, ridge row member 30 is provided, in the vicinity of its second transverse edge 34, with left hand mounting arrangement 70, including left hand mounting shelf 71, also as shown in Figure 5. With this structure, an array of ridge row members 30 may be attached longitudinally adjacent to one another above the uppermost roofing panels 10 in the area of, and on either side of, the roof apex. The area defined by the top longitudinal edges 35 of such an arrangement of ridge row members may cover a ridge cap 72, connected by ordinary fastener means 54, to the panels 10 on either side of the roof apex, as shown. And, of course, each ridge row member 30 is connected to the panel 10 therebelow by ordinary fastener means 54 through left hand mounting shelf 71, as shown in Figure 5. The novel roofing or siding system described above represents, in and of itself, a significant improvement over the prior art. In order to be even more useful in building construction, however, it is desirable that panels of this fashion be economical to produce and possessing a satisfactory degree of fire retardancy.Those objectives have also been accomplished by incorporating fly ash as a filler in the polyurethane foam mix. In particular, high sodium fly ash it. a composition meeting the standard of ATSM C 618, Vol. 14,Class C Mineral Ad Mixture , has been found suitable for each of those purposes and may be mixed in proportions as high as 70 fly ash and 30 polyol isocyanate. Although low sodium fly ash has been previously used in asphalt and cement products, it is believed that my discovery of this utility of high sodium fly ash in low density foam products is especially noteworthy in view of the fact that its inclusion has allowed the product of my invention to pass the UL 790 fire tests, i.e. Underwriters, Inc. Tests for Fire Resistance of RoofCovering Materials. And, naturally, because of its considerably lesser cost than foam system components, fly ash is economically beneficial as well. Further, I have found the inclusion of fly ash as a filler to provide superior dimensional stability to the produced foam, with little shrinkage of the foam occurring.
