# Clock circuit.

## Abstract
A clock generator circuit 10 receives an input signal PPCØ and generates a delayed clock output signal PCØ. The circuit 10 is set to an initial condition by a precharge signal PCØR prior to a transition of the input signal PPCØ. A time delay signal is produced at a node 26 by operation of transistors 18, 28 . The transition of the input signal PPCØ produces a bootstrapped voltage at a capacitor 68 . The delay signal activates a transistor 80 to couple the bootstrapped voltage to the gate terminal of an output transistor 88 . The gate terminal of the output transistor 88 is driven directly from a low voltage state to a boosted high voltage state. This causes the output signal PCØ to be driven from an initial low voltage state to the power supply voltage V
