## Description
This invention relates to a new amylase negative mutant of Most genetic material in a bacterium exists as giant DNA molecules which are present as the chromosome of the cell. A certain amount of the genetic material may also be present in the form of smaller, closed circular DNA molecules known as plasmids. The portion of the DNA molecule related to a specific hereditary trait is called a gene. By techniques referred to as genetic engineering, it is possible to transfer a gene, which codes for the production of a specific protein, from one microorganism to another. The microorganism which receives the new genetic material is referred to as the host. Various workers have used these techniques to provide microorganisms which are superior producers of certain specific proteins such as enzymes. It has been discovered that plasmids, which contain a series of genes linked together in the form of a circle, can be removed from the cells of one microorganism and inserted into the cells of another microorganism with comparative ease. Plasmids can also be used as vectors to carry new genetic material into a host organism. This is accomplished by first cutting the plasmid with an enzyme, known as a restriction endonuclease, that opens the circle of DNA. A fragment of foreign DNA, containing the desired gene, is inserted into the place where the DNA circle was cut. The circle is reformed by treatment with DNA ligase. The recombined plasmid, a new circular DNA molecule, contains the genes of the original plasmid plus the new gene from the piece of DNA which was inserted. This plasmid can be introduced into a host microorganism. The plasmid containing the new gene is then reproduced in the host microorganism and becomes part of its genetic material. For a host microorganism to be suitable for use in genetic engineering, it must be capable of incorporating the new DNA. Furthermore, it must yield a viable microorganism which expresses the traits coded in the newly inserted gene. For the microorganism to produce useful quantities of protein, the microorganism must also be one that can be grown on a commercial scale. Experimenters using the new recombinant DNA technology have been concerned that the microorganisms with new genetic material might produce substances harmful to man, animals or plants. Because of this concern, the National Institute of Health NIH issued Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules in 1978. These guidelines provided for various levels of physical containment in laboratories where genetic engineering experiments are conducted. They also established levels of biological containment for microorganisms containing recombinant DNA. Biological containment relates to the use of host cells and vectors which have limited ability to survive if they escape from the laboratories into the natural environment. Cells of microorganisms which do not form spores i.e., ones that are asporogenous have such a limited ability to survive. The present invention describes a new asporogenous mutant of The mutant of the present invention readily incorporates plasmids containing a thermostable In accordance with this invention, there is provided a culture of asporogenous In addition, there is provided a culture of amylase negative Also provided in accordance with this invention is a process for preparing a strain of Further provided in accordance with this invention is a process for preparing a strain of Finally, there is provided a process for using the strains of The Strain lA289 was reported by Steinmetz, et al, Strain lA221 was reported by Dubnau and Smith, The resultant transformant, designated as Bl 20, contains the markers A portion of the DNA from an asporogenic strain of The asporogenous, amylase negative strain of the present invention, Bl 109, shows a frequency of reversion to spore formers of less than about 10 ⁷. It is able to grow under industrial conditions and does not require expensive growth additives. It has a low survival rate under natural or escape conditions and a very low tendency to transmit plasmids to other organisms by natural genetic transfer. The organism shows a high degree of competence for plasmid uptake when subjected to classical transformation techniques. Excellent transformations were achieved using competent cell transformation procedures. It functions well as a host for various plasmid vectors making it useful as a host component of a A detailed genetic map of the The following example illustrates certain embodiments of the present invention. Unless otherwise stated, all proportions and percentages are provided on the basis of weight. All strains bearing ATCC numbers are available from the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Maryland. These strains have been deposited under the provisions of the Budapest Treaty for deposits of microorganisms for patent purposes. All reagents bearing the Difco name are available from the Difco Laboratories, Detroit, Michigan. Transformation of Cells of Donor DNA was obtained from Strain lA221 was grown in 100 ml Penassay Broth Competent cells of Strain B1 20 Donor DNA was obtained from Cells of Transformation was accomplished by mixing 20 µl of DNA isolated from Strain lS30 as described above with 0.5 ml of competent cells of Strain Bl 20 described above. The mixture was incubated at 30 37 C for 90 minutes with shaking at 250 rpm. The cultures were plated on agar plates after dilution with sterile water. Cells showing methionine positive, amylase negative characteristics were selected by growing cultures on agar plates containing Spizizen s minimal medium supplemented with tryptophan 5 µg ml and 1 Lintner starch. Six hundred colonies were then screened for asporogenic characteristics by heat shocking them for 10 minutes at 90 C. One colony, Bl 109, was asporogenic. It has the genetic markers Strain Bl 109 requires mineral salts containing ammonium, potassium, phosphate and sodium ions for growth. It will utilize various carbon sources including glucose. The strain does not revert to spore formers as shown by the following test. Cells were grown on agar plates containing DSM Both strains, Bl 20 and Bl 109, show a high degree of competence for plasmids in classical transformation reactions. The plasmid vectors are retained in these hosts even when the hosts with the vectors are grown at temperatures as high as 45 C. The work described herein was all done in conformity with physical and biological containment requirements specified in the NIH guidelines.
