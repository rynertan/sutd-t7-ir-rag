# Intraocular lens.

## Abstract
An intraocular lens device 10 is provided with fixation elements 14, 16 for centering it in the eye. At least one of the fixation elements comprises an elongated resilient strut carried at one end 22 by the lens 12 and having a first portion 20 extending outwardly of the lens generally toward circumferential eye structure, the second portion 24 having a contacting surface 26 engageable with the eye structure, and a third portion 28 extending from the contact surface generally inwardly toward the lens for a distance, measured radially inwardly toward the lens axis 30 , of at least about twofifths of the radial distance of the contact surface from the lens axis. The third portion has a free end 32 , providing the at least one fixation element with substantial elastic flexibility. The generally inwardly extending third portion of the strut prevents the end of the strut from becoming captured by a peripheral iridectomy opening.
