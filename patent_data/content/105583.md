# Method for packing chromatography columns and columns adapted for that method.

## Abstract
A method for packing a chromatography column 1 having an inlet port 14 at one end and an outlet port 11 at the other, comprises feeding a slurry or smoke of particulate bed material in a carrier fluid and applying a predetermined pressure to the bed material while allowing the carrier fluid to escape, wherein both the inlet and outlet ports 14,11 are protected by porous bed retaining means 6,7 positioned apart to provide a space for the bed between them, at least a final portion of the slurry or smoke being fed through a filter tube 15 into the space for the bed until the space is full and the bed extends back into the filler tube 15 predetermined pressure to the bed being applied via the slurry or smoke in the filler tube 15 , and the filler tube 15 then sealed being against relaxation of the bed pressure.
