# INFUSION CATHETER

## Abstract
A catheter 11 comprising an alongated flexible tube 17 having an elongated passage extending axially through the tube 17 between proximal 53 and distal 55 openings and a helically wound wire 25 engaging the peripheral wall of the tube 17 and providing a portion of the peripheral wall 17 with an uneven con tour. The tube includes a radiopaque marker 23 at the distal and of the catheter. The radiopaque marker 23 is molded from a biocompatible metal powder and a ther moplastic binder. The catheter 11 is adapted for use with an angiography catheter 57 , and it is configured to provide automatic orientation of the distal end portion 47 of the catheter 11 as such distal end portion 47 emerges from the distal opening 65 of the angiography catheter 57 .
