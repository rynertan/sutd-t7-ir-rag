## Abstract
An image reception apparatus includes a tuner 2 for selecting a broadcast channel of a cable system, a video detector 3 connected to the tuner 2 for deriving output signals having video signals and command data of the selected channel, a data fetch circuit 4 for extracting the command data and character data from the output signals derived from the video detector 3 , a display controller 5,6,7 for controlling video outputs to be displayed on a display screen, and a key pad 10 for supplying the control command to the display controller 5,6,7 . The display controller 5,6,7 includes a character generator 6 for generating character signals to be displayed on the display and a masking circuit 7 for superimposing masking signals on the video signal on request.
