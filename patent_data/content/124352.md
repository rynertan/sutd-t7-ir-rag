## Description
This invention relates to the field of specific binding assays, particularly to overcoming non specific protein interference in agglutination assays of non protein ligands. Agglutination assays are highly sensitive and used to determine a wide variety of substances. These assays have been embodied in commercially available test kits such as those used to detect triiodo L thyronine T₃ and or thyroxine T₄ . The development of specific binding assay techniques has provided extremely useful analytical methods for determining various organic substances of diagnostic, medical, environmental and industrial importance which appear in liquid media at very low concentrations. Specific binding assays are based on the specific interaction between a ligand, i.e. a bindable analyte under determination, and a binding partner therefor, i.e. receptor. Where one of the ligand and its binding partner is an antibody, and the other is a corresponding hapten or antigen, the assay is known as an immunoassay. These specific binding assays have been provided in a variety of solid state formats including analytical elements or test strips, coated tubes, particle associated reagents and others. Agglutination assays are among the most widely used solid state specific binding assays, usually as immunoassays. They may be classified as direct, indirect passive or inhibition type agglutination assays. In a direct agglutination assay, particles having surface components which are one member of a specific binding pair e.g., a receptor , are reacted with a sample to be assayed for the other member of the specific binding pair e.g., ligand . In the indirect passive agglutination format, one member of a specific binding pair e.g., receptor is bound to a solid substrate particle, and this particle bound member is reacted with a sample to be assayed for the other member of the pair e.g., ligand . In inhibition type agglutination assays, a sample to be tested for one binding pair member is first reacted with a solution containing the other member of the binding pair and this prereacted solution is then reacted with particles which contain direct or are bound with indirect the binding pair member suspected of being in the sample. Agglutination assays have been summarized in the literature. See, for example, Bellanti, When assaying complex liquids, such as human serum, many non specific proteins, such as lipoproteins and autoantibodies, inhibit the agglutination reaction. Therefore, these proteins must be destroyed to obtain accurate measurement of ligand concentrations. The prior art has thus far required a pretreatment procedure separate from the assay. For example, Kobayashi, et al, Non specific protein interference in assays for non protein ligands can be overcome by first digesting the proteins using a proteolytic enzyme such as pepsin. The enzyme is then inactivated or destroyed prior to the assay. For example, Collet Cassart, et al Agglutination assays so far available, including those for the determination of T₃ and T₄, have suffered from non specific protein interference. Invariably, it has been necessary to perform preliminary procedures to overcome this source of interference. Thus, despite the efforts reflected in the above references, no one has met the problem of providing a specific binding agglutination assay which avoids the effects of this interference without the need for pretreatment. In accordance with the present invention, specific binding assays are provided in which the effects of non specific protein interference are avoided or overcome without the need for pretreatment steps. As such, it is now possible to provide a homogeneous immunoassay format in which this interference has been overcome and which is particularly suitable for use in automated analysis systems. These advantages are achieved by the specific binding non protein ligand assay test material of the present invention, which material comprises a a solid phase incorporated with one partner of a specific binding pair comprising a ligand or a binding analog thereof and a specific binding protein therefor b a conjugate comprising the other partner of said specific binding pair covalently bound to a substance which protects the specific binding protein of said pair from enzyme inactivation when bound with its partner and c a proteolytic enzyme. The invention further provides a specific binding method of assaying for a non protein ligand in a sample, which method consists essentially of the steps of i combining said sample in a reaction mixture with a a solid phase incorporated with one partner of a specific binding pair comprising said ligand or a binding analog thereof and a specific binding protein therefor b a conjugate comprising the other partner of said specific binding pair covalently bound to a substance which protects the specific binding protein of said pair from enzyme inactivation when bound with its partner and c a proteolytic enzyme and ii detecting any resultant binding in said same reaction mixture. Various embodiments, which include or use the method are also contemplated. For example, the test material can be provided as part of a test kit. The kit comprises the packaged combination of one or more containers of or devices incorporated with the components of the test material in any of a variety of physical formats.

Specific terms in the following description which refer only to a particular embodiment are exemplary of all of the embodiments unless otherwise indicated. Sample fluids on which tests are performed include biological, physiological, industrial, environmental, and other types of liquids. Of particular interest are biological fluids such as serum, plasma, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, milk, broth and other culture media and supernatants as well as fractions of any of them. Physiological fluids of interest include infusion solutions, buffers, preservative or antimicrobial solutions and the like. Industrial liquids include fermentation media and other processing liquids used, for example, in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, dairy products and malt beverages. Other sources of sample fluid which are tested by conventional methods are contemplated as within the meaning of this term as used and can, likewise, be assayed in accordance with the invention. In the context of this invention, the expression non protein ligand refers to any substance, or class of related substances, which are not susceptible to protein inactivating, i.e.proteolytic enzymes and whose presence is to be qualitatively or quantitatively determined in a sample fluid, such as those just described. The present assay can be applied to the detection of any such ligand for which there is a specific binding partner and, conversely, to the detection of the capacity of a liquid medium to bind such a ligand usually due to the presence of a binding partner for the ligand in the sample . The ligand usually is an organic molecule for which a specific binding partner exists or can be developed. The ligand, in functional terms,is usually selected from antigens, haptens, hormones, vitamins, metabolites and pharmacological agents and their receptors and binding substances. Specific examples of non protein ligands which can be detected using the present invention are hormones such as thyroxine T₄ and triiodothyronine T₃ antigens and haptens such as ferritin, bradykinin, prostaglandins, and tumor specific antigens vitamins such as biotin, vitamin B₁₂ folic acid, vitamin E, vitamin A, and ascorbic acid metabolites such as 3 , 5 guanosine monophosphate, pharmacological agents or drugs such as aminoglycoside antibiotics like gentamicin, amikacin and sisomicin, or drugs of abuse such as the opium alkaloids and ergot derivatives. The terminology specific binding protein or receptor refers to any substance, or class of substances, which has a specific binding affinity for the non protein ligand to the exclusion of other substances. In the majority of embodiments, the present invention will incorporate specific binding assay reagents which interact with the ligand or its binding capacity in the sample in an immunochemical manner. That is, there will be an antigen antibody or hapten antibody relationship between reagents and or the ligand or its binding capacity in the sample. Such assays therefore are termed immunoassays and the special interaction between the ligand and its receptor, or binding partner, is an immunochemical binding. The use of either polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies is contemplated. Additionally, it is well understood in the art that other binding interactions between the ligand and the binding partner serve as the basis of specific binding assays, including the binding interactions between hormones, vitamins, metabolites, and pharmacological agents, and their respective receptors and binding substances. For example, polypeptide hormone receptors as binding agents or partners are discussed in Langan, et al, Eds. The proteolytic enzyme of the present invention is any enzyme which is effective to negate the chemical or biological properties of a protein, usually an endogenous protein, which causes it to produce non specific interference effects on specific binding agglutination assay reactions. The use of such enzymes in reducing or eliminating these interfering effects has been described in pretreatment of samples apart from the actual assay procedures. Any of the enzymes so described or having a substantially similar effect can be used. These primarily include proteolytic enzymes such as trypsin, pepsin, chymotrypsin, carboxypeptidase and mixtures of proteases such as Pronase mixed enzyme preparation Calbiochem Behring Corp., LaJolla, CA . Such protein inactivating enzymes are discussed at length in Perlmann Lorand Eds. , Methods in Enzymology Proteolytic Enzymes Vol. XIX , Academic Press, N.Y. 1970 . The solid state or solid phase of the present invention can take on a multitude of forms, and is therefore intended as being broad in context. It can be mono or multi phasic, comprising one or more appropriate materials or mediums of similar or different absorptive or other physical characteristics. It can be hydrophobic or hydrophilic, bibulous or nonporous. In its most efficient embodiment the solid phase can be carefully tailored to suit the characteristics of the particular specific binding assay system to be employed. In one embodiment the solid phase is a matrix or surface capable of being incorporated with specific binding assay reagents. It can take on many known forms such as those utilized for chemical and enzymatic solution analysis. Solid phase test devices have been applied to specific binding assays. A commonly used solid phase device comprises a nonporous surface, such as the interior surface of a test tube or other vessel, to which antibody is affixed or coated by adsorption or covalent coupling. Likewise, devices for use in specific binding assays wherein the antibody reagent is fixed to a matrix held in a flow through column are known U.S. Patents Nos. 4,036,947 4,039,652 4,059,684 4,153,675 and 4,166,102 . U.S. Patents Nos. 3,826,619 4,001,583 4,017,597 and 4,105,410 relate to the use of antibody coated test tubes in radioimmunoassays. Solid phase test devices have also been used in enzyme immunoassays U.S. Patents Nos. 4,016,043 and 4,147,752 and in fluorescent immunoassays U.S. Patents Nos. 4,025,310 and 4,056,724 and British Patent Spec. No. 1,552,374 . The use of such heterogeneous specific binding assay test devices is exemplified by the method of U.S. Patent No. 4,135,884. The test device is incorporated with the antibody reagent and is brought into contact with the liquid sample and with the remaining reagents of the reaction system. After an incubation period, the solid phase device is physically removed from the reaction solution and the label measured either in the solution or on the test device. In one preferred embodiment the element can be in the form of a test slide, made from a material such as polystyrene, which has been molded to have at least one reaction well, usually centrally disposed therein. The well usually has a diameter of from about 1.0 to about 2.5 centimeters cm and has a depth of from about 1.0 to about 10 millimeters mm , preferably from about 2 mm to about 6 mm. The most preferred solid phase format is particulate. As previously noted, particle associated agglutination assays include those assays using particles having specific binding pair members as surface components or substrate particles to which such components have been bound. These substrate particles preferably range in size from about 0.1 to about 5.0 microns in diameter, with bacterial substrate particles usually ranging from about 1 to about 3 microns in diameter. Substrate particles which have been used as carriers of specific binding pair members include eucaryotic red blood cells unaltered or tanned , siliceous earth e.g., bentonite , latex, and procaryotic particles e.g., bacterial cells . The so called latex particles consist normally of a synthetic polymeric material such as polystyrene. Other suitable organic polymers include butadiene, styrene butadiene copolymers, acrylic polymers or mixtures thereof. Procaryotic particles such as bacterial or fungal cells or virus particles have also been widely used as substrate particles in agglutination assays. Among the bacteria used as substrate particles are those from the genus Many organic molecules will readily adhere by non covalent adsorption to such substrate particles. For example, red blood cells erythrocytes readily adsorb many polysaccharides. Also, the protein A in S. aureus, Cowan I strain, specifically binds to the Fc locus of certain immunoglobulins. For the attachment of proteins, however, it is usually necessary to first treat the particles or covalently link the proteins, such as through linking groups. Linking groups which have been used include bis diazo benzidine, glutaraldehyde and 1, 3 difluoro 4, 6 dinitrobenzene. Others are discussed in Fudenberg, et al, Eds. , Basic Clinical Immunology, Lange Medical Publications, Los Altos, CA., pg. 310 1976 . The substance which protects the specific binding protein of the specific binding pair from enzyme inactivation when bound with its partner is contemplated as being any natural or synthetic molecule which is not, itself, suspectible to the proteolytic enzyme and can sequester, disguise, preferentially bind or otherwise associate with the specific binding protein to render it insusceptible to the proteolytic enzyme. Substances which can be used for this purpose include large molecules which sterically protect the binding protein from enzyme attack when bound. Exemplary of such large molecules are high molecular weight polymers like dextran or Ficoll The test material of the invention includes a conjugate comprising the binding partner for the species associated with the solid phase whether it be specific binding protein or ligand, covalently bound to a substance which protects the specific binding protein of the pair from enzyme inactivation when bound with its partner. The conjugate is formed using conventional organic synthesis techniques which do not impair or alter the specificity of the binding partner which it includes. Although it is not a theory on which the invention must be predicated, at least one mechanism for the unexpected agglutinated binding protein protection results achieved can be described. In all cases there is a solid phase incorporated with one partner of a specific binding pair comprising the ligand or a binding analog thereof and a specific binding protein therefor. In the mechanism postulated here, the conjugate comprises the other partner of said specific binding pair, which has an avidity and is present in a concentration which together provide a first association rate, covalently bound to a substance that protects the specific binding protein of said pair from enzyme inactivation when bound with its partner and the active protein inactivating enzyme has an avidity and is present in a concentration which together provides a second association rate which is less than the first association rate. In accordance with this and other possible mechanisms the specific binding protein, e.g., antibody, is present in the reaction mixture in a concentration of at least about 0.04 percent weight volume w v , and preferably from about 0.04 percent w v to about 0.07 percent w v . Likewise, the proteolytic enzyme is present in a concentration of not more than about 4.0 milligrams per milliliter mg ml , and preferably from about 2.0 to about 4.0 mg ml. One example of this is a specific binding assay composition or material which includes a a particle associated thyroxine or triiodothyronine antibody in a concentration of from about 0.04 to about 0.07 percent w v b trypsin in a concentration of from about 2.0 to about 4.0 mg ml and c a conjugate as described above in a concentration of from about 0.22 to about 0.88 micrograms per milliliter ug ml . The following working Examples describe experiments which were performed in developing the present invention. Standard commercially available reagent grade chemicals were used whenever possible. Measurement of total serum thyroxine T₄ is the single most important test for determining thyroid function. The normal T₄ range is 4.5 to 12.0 micrograms deciliter ug dl however, the test must be able to detect concentrations as low as 1.0 ug dl and as high as 24.0 ug dl. This is necesary to accurately identify those patients who have thyroid disorders. This Example reports experiments which demonstrate a nonisotopic, homogeneous T₄ immunoassay in accordance with the invention. Antibody to T₄ was induced in New Zealand white rabbits by an intradermal primary injection of 400 ug of a conjugate which was T₄ covalently coupled to bovine serum albumin BSA emulsified in an equal volume of Freund s complete adjuvant. Secondary booster immunizations contained 400 ug of T₄ BSA conjugate emulsified in an equal volume of incomplete Freund s adjuvant and were administered once a month. The animals were bled three times a week. Antibody specific for T₄ was isolated by immunoadsorbtion. The immunoadsorbent consisted of T₄ covalently bound to Sepharose Purified antibody, described above, is coupled to chloromethyl styrene latex by a modification of the method described in Masson, et al, T₄ was covalently coupled to cyanogen bromide activated Ficoll T₄ Ficoll Antibody sensitized latex, prepared as described above, 8 anilino 1 naphthalenesulfonic acid Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY , Tween The reference method was a solid phase coated tube Gamma Coat The assay of the present invention may be performed using a spectrophotometer or an automated clinical chemistry analyzer. A Technicon RA 1000 As an initial step, T₄ Ficoll Next, one hundred three 103 human sera were analyzed by the method of the invention, automated with a Technicon RA 1000 instrument system, and by the RIA reference procedure described above to determine the degree with which the results from the two methods correlated. The data are shown in Fig. 2. The correlation data were analyzed by orthogonal linear regression and are summarized below. For purposes of comparison with the above, 21 human sera were analyzed as described above for the present invention with the exception that trypsin was not included in the reaction mixture. The data are shown in Fig. 3 and summarized below. The data shown in Fig. 1 demonstrate that specific antibody latex T₄ Ficoll The improvement in the method brought about by including a proteolytic enzyme, such as trypsin, in the reaction mixture is demonstrated by the difference between Figs. 2 and 3. As shown in Fig. 3, in the absence of trypsin the values produced by the latex immunoassay were about twice as high as the reference method. This was due to non specific serum interference and resulted in serum samples having erroneously elevated values. This non specific interference was destroyed by trypsin as demonstrated in Fig. 2, which shows excellent correlation between the latex immunoassay with trypsin and the reference method. The experiments reported here compare the use of T₄ Dextran with the use of T₄ Ficoll T₄ was covalently coupled to cyanogen bromide activated Dextran, T500 Pharmacia, supra using exactly the same procedure as described for T₄ Ficoll T₄ Dextran, polyethylene Glycol 8000, Tween T₄ standard curves were measured using the Technicon RA 1000 instrument system and either T₄ Ficoll Both T₄ Dextran and T₄ Ficoll The experiments reported here compare the use of chymotrypsin as the proteolytic enzyme with the use of trypsin. The antisera preparation, antibody purification, antibody sensitized latex and antibody sensitized latex reagent preparations, T₄ Ficoll The reagent was prepared exactly as described in Example I for the T₄ Ficoll Twenty one human sera were analyzed by the antigen protection latex immunoassay using the Technicon RA 1000 instrument system in the presence of either trypsin or chymotrypsin. The data are presented by the scatter plot in Fig. 5, and analyzed by orthogonal linear regression below. Chymotrypsin may be used in place of trypsin in the Protected Binding Assay of the invention. As shown in Fig. 5, equivalent results were obtained when either trypsin or chymotrypsin were included in the reaction mixture. The T₄ Ficoll The experiments reported here compare the use of Pronase B Grade, Calbiochem Behring Corp., LaJolla, CA proteolytic enzyme mixture with the use of trypsin. The antisera preparation, antibody purification, antibody sensitized latex and antibody sensitized latex reagent preparations, T₄ Ficoll This reagent was prepared exactly as described in Example I for the T₄ Ficoll Twenty one human sera were analyzed by the antigen protection latex immunoassay, using a Technicon RA 1000 instrument system, in the presence of either trypsin or Pronase. The data are presented by the scatter plot in Fig. 6 and were analyzed by orthogonal linear regression below. Pronase may be used in place of trypsin in the Protected Binding Assay of the invention. As shown in Fig. 6, equivalent results were obtained when either trypsin or Pronase was used in the assay. Both enzymes produced about the same average value of T₄, 11.2 ug dl for trypsin and 11.6 ug dl for Pronase, and the slope of the correlation plot was 1.02. The T₄ Ficoll Theophylline 1,3 dimethylxanthine is commonly used in the treatment of bronchial asthma. The serum concentration of the drug must be closely monitored since the drug has a narrow therapeutic range of 10 20 ug ml while drug concentrations in excess of 20 ug ml may be toxic. The experiments reported below demonstrate that the antigen protection latex immunoassay of the invention can be used to accurately and precisely quantitate serum levels of theophylline. Rabbit anti theophylline antisera were purchased from Kallestad, Austin, TX. Antibody was isolated by ammonium sulfate precipitation. Antisera was mixed in equal volumes with saturated ammonium sulfate solution which had been previously adjusted to pH 8. The solution was stirred at 4 C for two hours and the precipitated antibody was then isolated by centrifugation. The pellet was washed twice with a volume of 50 saturated ammonium suflate, pH 8.0, that was equal to the original volume of antiserum. The precipitate was then solublized in a volume of borate buffer saline pH 8.1 that was equal to the original volume of antiserum. The antibody solution was then exhaustively dialyzed against borate buffered saline pH 8.1 and clarified by centrifugation. The isolated antibody was stored at 20 C until used. Purified antibody, described above, is coupled to chloromethyl styrene latex by a modification of the method described in Masson, et al, 8 E carboxypropyl theophylline was synthesized exactly as described in Cook et al, N 2 aminoethyl carbamylmethylated Ficoll 8 E carboxypropyltheophylline was covalently coupled to AECM Ficoll Theophylline Ficoll Anybody sensitized latex, prepared as described above, and Tween The reference method was the Emit aad theophylline assay Syva, Palo Alto, CA and was used according to the manufacturer s direction. The assay of the present invention may be performed using either a spectrophotometer or an automated clinical chemistry analyzer. A Technicon RA 1000 Eighty one human sera were obtained from patients being treated with theophylline. These sera were analyzed by the method of the present invention employing the Kallestad polyclonal antibody and by the Syva Emit reference method to determine the degree with which the results from the two methods correlated. The data are shown in Fig. 7. The correlation data were analyzed by orthogonal linear regression and are summarized below. 81 10.6ug ml 11.5ug ml 1.09 0.06ug ml 0.99 The correlation data indicate excellent agreement between the theophylline protected binding immunoassay and the reference method. The average value produced by the present method, 11.5 ug ml, is almost identical to the average value produced by the reference method, 10.6 ug ml. The slope of the scatter plot was close to unity, the intercept negligible, and the correlation coefficient was 0.99, all of which indicate that the method produces results equivalent to the reference method. The experiments reported here compare polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies in the theophylline Protected Binding Assay. All of the materials, preparations and procedures were identical to those described in Example V, with the addition that monoclonal mouse anti theophylline was also purchased from Kallestad, Austin, TX. The dose response curves obtained with the polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies are shown in Fig. 8. The two antibodies show similar dynamic range and sensitivities when used in the assay of the invention. Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies may be used in the assay of the invention.
