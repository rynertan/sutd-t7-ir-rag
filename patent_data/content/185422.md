# Method of operating a ground engaging implement.

## Abstract
A pipeline trenching plough is towed along the seabed by a tow wire 20 connected to a ship or tractor. The course of the plough is changed or maintained by oppositely acting forces imposed on tne wire 20 and on the body 10 of the plough by a hydraulic ram 24 . The offset angle between the wire 20 and the lengthwise direction 30 of the plough is monitored by a potentiometer 33, 35 . The wire 20 is connected to the plough at a real hitch point 22 vertically above the centre of resistance 23 of soil forces on the ploughshare 12 and landside 14 . Under normal equilib rium conditions the forces from the ram are zero. The forces required to change the course are small and independent of the offset angle. Ram force can counteract a side sloping seabed. In modifications, the wire 20 is connected to a virtual hitch point formed by an adjustable linkage or by a carriage adjustable along a transverse beam.
