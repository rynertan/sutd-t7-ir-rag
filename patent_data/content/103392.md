# Fortified epoxy resin compositions and process for the preparation thereof.

## Abstract
Heat curable epoxy resin compositions comprising a resin forming polyepoxide and an amine curing agent are fortified i. e. given increased strength and modulus but without consequent brittleness by incorporating into the resin mix prior to curing up to 40 parts by weight per hundred parts of resin of a fortifying agent which is the reaction product of an aromatic amine, e. g. aniline, with a mono or di epoxide, the fortifier thus obtained optionally further being reacted with an isocyanate or nitrile prior to incorpo ration into the resin mix.
