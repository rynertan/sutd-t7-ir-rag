## Description
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of CNS stimulants, to intermediates useful in this process and their preparation and to compositions of the intermediates having CNS stimulant activity. After the discovery of the central nervous system stimulatolDr properties of 3 l methyl 2 phenyle thyl N phenylcarbamoyl sydnone imine Sydnocarb U. S. S. R.329,890 and Offenlegungsshrift 2,028,880 various analogues have been reported. U. S. S. R. 222,370 and Offenlegungrsschrift 2,738,022 disclose sydnone imines which contain phenyl, 1 or 2 phenylethyl and the phenylisopropyl groups in 3 position as well as N meta and para chlorophenyl and N phenyl carbamoyl groups. Variations of 3 benzyl sydnonimines are disclosed in U. S.3,277,108. Other variously substituted 3 aralByl syd nonimines are disclosed by Olovyanishinkiva et al.,Khim. Geterotsikl Soedin, 2, 170 175 1978 and 3, 11981203 1975 . Sydnocarb is conventionally produced by cyanometh ylaticn of amphetamine followed by nitrosation and ring closure with a mineral acid to yield sydnophen as an acid halide salt which is reacted with phenylisocyanate under mildly basic conditions to introduce the N phenylcarbamoyl group. As an asymmetric compound, ampheta mine may be employed as the initial reactant as the racemic d,l mixtu1e or as the pure d or l isomer to yield racemic or optically active sydnophen and ultimately sydnocarb. Yashuiiskii et al., J. Wised. Chem., 14, 1013 1015 1971 disclose the marked CNS stimulatory effect of 3 1 methyl 2 phenylethyl sydnonimine Sydnophen . The relative activities of a large number of alkyl, aryl and aralkylsydnonjinines are presented in Table 1 on page 1014. lost of them including compound XVIII 2 hydrocy l me tfryl 2 phenylethyl syd nonimi ne , were e 5 sen tially inactive central nervous system stimulants relative to compound XIII Sydnophen , demonstrating the criticality of the structure of the 3 substituent in the Sydnocarb series of compounds as far as CNS stimulatory activity is concerned.Thus, although the activity profile of Sydnocarb is not identical to that of amphetamine, or for that matter Sydnophen, CNS stimulatory activity is a common property of the initial reactant amphetamine, the intermediate Sydnophen and the final product Sydnocarb. Although Sydnocarb and its derivatives disclosed in the literature form salts with various organic and inorganic acids, such salts are not appreciably water soluble and when stirred in water, the complex or adduct salt is broken up to reisolate the neutral mesoionic sydnone imine substrate. The salts of sydnocarb are not true salts, in the classical sense, in that they do not dissociate in water to form water soluble ions consisting of the protonated substrate and the corresponding anion derived from the acidifying agent. The metabolites of Sydnocarb have been studied by several groups. L. E. Kholodov and E. T. Lilin, Mater, Resp. Rasshir. Konf Farmacol. Gruz. 2nd 1977, 84 5 report finding hydroxylation of Sydnocarb at the beta carbon of the phenylisopropyl substituent and at the phenyl ring of the phenylcarbamoyl group, hydrolytic cleavage of the phenylcarbamoyl group and ring opening of the heterocyclic nucleus. They report that the psychostimulating activity of Sydnocarb is a property of that compound and not its metabolites. Polgar et al., Acta. Pharm. Hung., 48, Suppl. 23 24 1978 and Xenobiotica, 9, No. 8, 511 520 1979 report several hydroxylated metabolites and conjugates of hydroxylated metabolites. in which the enantiomeric form is 1 when R5 is hydrogen in the presence or absence of the d form and l threo when R5 is methyl in the presence or absence of the d threo form RÚ and Rê are, independently, hydrogen, alkyl of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, alkoxy of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, halo, perfluoroalkyl of 1 to 3 carbon atoms, nitro, alkanoyl of 2 to 4 carbon atoms, or alkoxycarbonyl of 2 to 4 carbon atoms R3 is hydrogen, halo, nitro or alkanoyl of 2 to 4 carbon atoms R4 is hydrogen, halo, nitro or perfluoroalkyl of 1 to 3 carbon atoms R5 and R6 are, independently, hydrogen or methyl and B is a hydroxy protecting group or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, which comprises a protecting the appropriate precursor nitrosonitrile of the formula EMI3.1 in which R1, R2, R5 and R6 are as defined above, or b acylating the appropriate precursor nitrosonitrile of the formula VI as defined above with an acyl halide or anhydride providing the groupEMI3.2 and then reacting the product with an amine of formula HNR BR in which formula z, R7 and R8 are as defined in Claim 2 and after step a or b reacting the hydroxy protected nitrosonitrile with an isocyanate of the formula EMI4.1 where R3 and R4 are as defined above, in the presence of an organic amine base, if desired converting to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt.4. A process for preparing a compound of formula IV as defined in Claim 3 wherein B isEMI4.2 which comprises acylating a corresponding compound of formulaEMI4.3 stimulants comparable in potency to the final products of U.S. Patent No. 4277609 and which afford prodrugs with hydrophobic or hydrophilic characteristics, and 3 a group of prodrug compounds which are preparable directly by the process of this invention or from the products of U.S. Patent No. 4,277,609 EP PublicationNo. 24924 . This invention provides a process for preparing a group of central nervous system stimulants which are 3 2 hydroxy 2 phenylethyl N phenylamino carbonylJ sydnonimines optionally substituted in either or both phenyl rings having the formula I as shown above in which the enantiomeric form is 1 when R is hydrogen in the presence or absence of the d form and l threo when R5 is methyl in the presence or absence of the d threo form , R1 and R2 are, independently, hydrogen, alkyl of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, alkoxy of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, halo, perfluoroalkyl of 1 to 3 carbon atoms, nitro, alkanoyl of 2 to 4 carbon atoms, or alkoxycarbonyl of 2 to 4 carbon atoms R3is hydrogen, halo, nitro or alkanoyl of 2 to 4 carbon atoms R4 is hydrogen, halo, nitro or perfluoroalkyl of 1 to 3 carbon atoms R5 and R6 are, independently, hydrogen or methyl or a non toxic acid addition salt thereof. It is generally preferred that the halo substituent be chlorine, bromine or fluorine although iodine is acceptable. Likewise, it is preferred that the alkyl and alkoxy substituents be relatively small, the methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy and isopropoxy groups being preferred. The R3 substituent in 4 position when P4 is hydrogen influences potency to a greater extent than R1, R2 and R4 and is preferably a halogen. The non toxic acid addition salts of the compounds are conventionally produced by the method and from any of the acids disclosed in U. S. 3,277,108.The adduct products are preferably formed with hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, phosphoric, phosphorous, acetic, propionic, fumeric, oxalic, succinic or maleic acid. The 3 2 hydroxy 2 phenylethyl sydnonimine compounds contain a chiral center at the benzylic carbon atoms and appear as the racemic d,l mixture which is resolvable into the pure d and 1 isomers. The l isomer possesses substantially all of the CNS stimulatory ac tivity and is preferred over the racemic mixture for that reason. The 3 2 hydroxy 1 methyl 2 phenylethyl sydnon imincs and the 3 2 hydroxy 2 methyl 1 methyl 2 phenyl et hyl sydnonimines prepared by this invention contain two chiral centers and provide two racemic mixtures of product. Of the four optically active isomers only the l threo isomer is meaningfully active as a central nervous system stimulant. It is noted in US Patent No.4277609 EP 24924 that in the special situation where the Rti substituent of the benzylic carbon atom of the nitroso nitrile was other than hydrogen, direct conversion of the intermediate nitroso nitrile to the final product could be accomplished by reaction with an appropriately substituted aryl isocyanate in the presence of an organic amine base, such as triethylamine, 4 dimethylaminopyridine, and the like, following the procedure disclosed in Offenlegungsschrift 2,738,022. However, when R6 is. hydrogen, reaction of the nitroso nitrile with the isocyanate does not give the desired product. It has now been discovered that all of the 2 hydroxy substituted nitroso nitrile intermediates disclosed in my said copending application can be directly converted to the desired Sydnocarb derivatives without separate production of the Sydnophen intermediate. Thus, the step of cyclization of the nitroso nitrile to obtain the Sydnophen intermediate can be completely omitted by the process of this invention. Hence, in accordance with the first aspect of this invention, there is provided a method for producing the 3 2 hydroxy 2 phenylethyl N phenylamino carbonyl3sydnonimines of Formula I, supra, which comprises reacting by nucleophilic addition an appropriate compound of the formula EMI8.1 in which B is a hydroxyl protecting group and R1, R2, R5 and R6 are defined above, with an isocyanate of the formula EMI8.2 where R3 and R4 are defined above, and subsequently removing the protecting group B. The hydroxyl protecting groups applicable in the process of this invention are well known. Exemplary protecting groups are lower alkanoyl of from 1 6 carbon atoms such as acetyl, propionyl, isopropionyl, etc. , benzoyl, tert butyl, benzyloxycarbonyJ or a silyl group . In selecting a particular hydroxyl protecting group, the criteria for applicability are that the protecting group must be stable during nucleophilic addition to the isocyanate and the protecting group must be removable under reaction conditions which would not other wise affect the molecule and preferably, where the protecting group is to be retained for use of the compound as a pro drug, its metabolite should produce no untoward effect.Based upon those standards, the preferred pro tccting groups are the lower alkanoyl groups. then production of a pro drug is not desired, it is preferred that the protecting group B be selected to achieve rapid deprotection during and as a result of normal workup procedures following production of the desired compound.The trimethylsilyl group is ideal for this purpose, although other known silyl protecting groups may be used because X,O bis trimethylsilyl acetamide is readily available, requires no acid acceptor during reaction with the hydroxyl group, affords neutral or volatile by products of the silylation reaction and is removed in the normal work up of the desired product by treatment with an acid to obtain the water insoluble non toxic acid addition salt of the Sydnocarb derivative. Other applicable silyl groups are those tertiary R3Si and secondary R2Si silyl moieties in which R is lower alkyl, aryl preferably the phenyl group or aralkyl preferably the phenyl lower alkyl group and more preferably benzyl . The tri lower alkylsilyl groups being preferred because they are readily hydrolyzed with an alcohol or water to release the free hydroxy substituted product. Protection of the beta hydroxy group, when effected with conventional acylating agents such as acetyl chloride, acetic anhydride, and the like, requires the use of at least one equivalent of the acylating agent and one equivalent of an organic base acid receptor such as py riding The use of a silyl protecting group does not require an acid acceptor. Deprotection is accomplished with a mild base such as sodium or potassium carbonate in protic solvent or with an acid in the case of silyl protection. Thus, this invention also provides a group of compounds of the formula EMI10.1 in which the enantiomeric form is 1 when Rb is hydrogen in the presence or absence of the d form and l threo 5 when R is methyl in the presence or absence of the d threo form and R1 to R6 are defined above and B is a hydroxyl protecting group. Compounds of formula IV are prepared by a protecting the appropriate precursor nitroso nitrile of the formula EMI10.2 and reacting the product with an isocyanate of formula III as defined above, or b acylating the compound of formula VI with an acyl halide or anhydride providing an acyl group of formula Cl CH2 z CQ and reacting the product with an amine of formulaHNR7R8 in which formulae z, R7 and RB are as defined below in connection with formula V and reacting the product with an isocyanate of formula II as defined above. As mentioned previously, certain hydroxy protected sydnocarb derivatives are directly useful as antidepressants in that they are equal in activity to the free hydroxy substituted final products. These protected sydnocarb derivatives serve as pro drugs in that the protecting group is enzymatically removed in vivo to release the free hydroxy sydnocarb derivatives as CNS stimulants. These protected hydroxy sydnocarb derivatives form an additional compound aspect of the invention. Thus, embraced by formula IV are certain pro drugs such as those in which B is alkanoyl of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, tert butyl or benzoyl. In addition, a unique group of pro drugs reside in beta hydroxy protected sydnocarb derivatives in which the hydroxy protecting groups are amino substituted acyl moieties such as are represented by the formula EMI11.1 in which z is an integer from 1 to 6 R7 is alkyl of 1 to 6 carbon atoms or aralkyl of 7 to 16 carbon atoms R8 is alkyl of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, aralkyl of 7 to 16 carbon atoms, dialkylaminoalkyl of 3 to 18 carbon atoms or diaralkylaminoalkyl of 14 to 32 carbon atoms or R7 and R8 are concatenated to form the 4 morpholinyl moiety or a radical of the formulae EMI12.1 wherein R9 is alkyl of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, aryl of 6 to 10 carbon atoms, hydroxyalkyl of 1 to 6 carbon atoms aralkyl of 7 to 16 carbon atoms or alkoxyalkyl of 2 to 12 carbon atoms R10 is alkylamino of 1 to 6 carbon atoms or piperidino n is one of the integers 3, 4 or 5 m is one of the integers 1 or 2 r is one of the integers 2 or 3 s is an integer from 0 to 6 t is an integer fromO to 6 with the proviso that the sum of s and t is 3 to 6 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The salts of the aminoacyloxy protected sydnocarb derivatives are water soluble and therefore amenable to administration via an aqueous vehicle. The non water soluble salt forming and hydrophobic substituted betahydroxy sydnocarb pro drug derivatives are vadminister able either neat or via suspension or emulsions for lipophilic assimilation and in vivo conversion to the free hydroxy substituted stimulants. Where desired, the pro drug compounds embraced by formula IV may be produced directly from the final product hydroxy sydnocarb derivatives of U.S. Patent No.4,277,609. Thus, the hydroxy sydnocarb derivatives may be directly acylated with the desired acyl group to obtain the desired pro drug. With the aminoacyl protecting groups, an indirect preparatory technique may be employed. For exampls, chloroacetylation of a betahydroxy sydnocarb derivative provides an intermediate in which the amino substituent may be tailored as desired.Thus, the chloroacetylated product is reacted with a desired mono amine or di amine such as those disclosed inU.S. 3,886,276 from which the disclosure of applicable di amines is incorporated herein by reference to afford amino acetate esters of the hydroxy sydnocarb derivatives from which pharmaceutically acceptable watersoluble salts are produced. Unlike the Sydnone imine salts of the prior art, the salts formed with the aminoacetate esters of the hydroxy substituted Sydnone imine derivatives of this invention are water soluble, dissociating sufficiently to dissolve in aqueous medium to provide a homogenous solution.Thus, the salts of the aminoacylated beta hydroxy sydnocarb derivatives may be formulated for administration in aqueous vehicle thereby expanding the routes available for practical dosing to achieve central nervous system stimulation to patients unable to receive treatment orally. Accordingly this invention provides a process for preparing a compound of formula IV wherein B has formula V as herein defined which comprises acylating a corresponding compound of formula I with an acyl halide or anhydride providing an acyl group of formula V or Cl CH2 z CO and reacting the omega chloro acylated product with an amineR7 RB NH, and if desired converting to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. Compounds of formula IV where B is Cl CH2 z CO are within the scope of this invention. The activity profile of the pro drug compounds of this invention is similar to that of amphetamine in some aspects while being devoid of other activities of amphetamine. For example, like amphetamine the pro drug compounds of this invention increase motor activity. However, the pro drug compounds of this invention are much less toxic than amphetamine, providing a slower onset of activity which indicates less euphoria and abuse potential . The pro drug compounds of this invention were shown to possess central nervous system stimulant activity by subjecting them to the following standard test procedure Male mice weighing 17 to 25 gms. are injected orally with drug solubilized or suspended in 1 Tween 80. Control animals are injected with 1 Tween 80. Six Columbus Instrument Company activity chambers are employed. Three mice given identical treatment are placed in each chamber for all tests. During each run, control animals 1 Tween only occupy 3 chambers the other 3 chambers measure activity of drug treated animals. For each dose of a given drug the experiment is run two times in a counterbalanced design so that each specific activity chamber records the activity of control animals during one run, and the activity of drug animals on the other run. Thus, at each dose level 18 mice are used in the drug group and 18 mice in the control group. Activity counts are recorded every ten minutes for a period of 2 hours. The data are analysed usingStudents t test comparing the means of the control and drug groups for each 10 minute period. The drug treated group is compared graphically with the control group in regard to duration of action and dose response at nnsk driln activity, As central nervous system stimulants with unique activity profiles, the pro drug compounds of this invention are useful in the treatment of anergic disorders such as sleepiness and fatigue including related types of depression and narcolepsy. Based upon the potency of the compounds of this invention in use in mice, the dose contemplated for use in the 70 kilogram human would vary from about 35 700 milligrams administered orally once or twice per day under the guidance of a physician.Of course, the dosage regimen as well as the route of administration, oral or parenteral, will vary with the condition of the patient relative to age, severity or depression, etc. Accordingly this invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a prodrug of formula IV wherein B has formula V or B is alkanoyl of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, tert butyl or benzoyl, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The following examples illustrate, without limitation, the novel process for producing the hydroxy sydnocarb derivatives of U.S. 4,277,609, the intermediates formed in that process, the hydroxy substituted pro drug compounds and the direct production of those pro drug compounds from the products disclosed in Us Patent No. 4277609.Activity counts represent the difference from control.l Sydnocarb presents a difference from control of 939 counts at 10 mg kg.
