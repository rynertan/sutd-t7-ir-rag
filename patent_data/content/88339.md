# Bearing beam structure of automotive engine.

## Abstract
A bearing beam structure 20 of an automotive internal combustion engine having a cylinder block 22 formed with bearing sections 32 , consists of a plurality of main bearing cap sections 36 each of which associates with each cylin der block bearing section 32 to rotatably support the jour nal of a crankshaft. First and second side wall sections 40A, 40B are provided to be respectively connected with the opposite side portions of each bearing cap section 36 to securely connect the bearing cap sections 36 with each other. Additionally, the first and second side wall sections 40A, 40B are respectively formed with first and second transmission installation sections 52 to which a trans mission housing 56 is rigidly connected, thereby greatly improving the rigidity of the cylinder block entire 22 while improving the connection rigidity between the cylinder block and a transmission.
