# HIGH PRESSURE DISCHARGE LAMPS WITH FAST RESTART

## Abstract
A light source including two high intensity discharge devices 10 and 12 , such as metal vapor discharge tubes, electrically coupled in parallel to provide fast restart and immediate illumination after a momentary power interrup tion. Upon application of power, one of the discharge devices 10 starts and operates while the other discharge device 12 remains below its maximum starting temperature and in read iness for immediate restart. The discharge devices 10 and 12 can be enclosed by a common outer envelope 14 . The dis charge devices can alternatively be high pressure electrode less lamps coupled in parallel to provide fast restart.
