# Sheet feeding system and electrosensitive sheet.

## Abstract
A sheet feeding system comprises sheet storage means 30 a stack 34 of sheets 36 in said storage means 40 sheet separating means 38 adapted to successively contact the uppermost of said sheet in said stack as said uppermost sheets are removed from said stack 34, said separating means 38 including a surface in frictional engagement with an uppermost sheet surface of said stack drive means for moving said surface in a direction substantially parallel to the sheets in said stack 34 so as to pull each of said uppermost sheets from said stack 34 each of said sheets 36 in said stack 34 carrying an antistatic electricity additive, preferably dimethyl ditallow ammonium chloride, for substantially minimizing the electrostatic attractive force between said sheets 36 so as to substantially equalize said pulling force required to separate the uppermost sheets beneath regardless of atmospheric conditions. Means 44, 46, 48 may be provided for transporting said sheets from said storage means to another location. Examples of antistatic sheets for use in the system are given.
