# Surface acoustic wave accelerometer.

## Abstract
A differential surface acoustic wave SAW ac celerometer comprises a resilient beam 1 one end of which is clamped in a support 2. Opposite faces of the beam are provided with SAW transducers 3, 4 and 6, 7 which respec tively form delay lines driven by oscillator 5. Means are introduced for setting the beam into a low frequency me chanical flexural oscillation. The two outputs are connected in antiphase so that under conditions of no acceleration null points in the output waveform will be equally spaced. During acceleration the time intervals between successive nulls will become unequal.
