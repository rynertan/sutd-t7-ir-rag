# CONNECTING ROD

## Abstract
A connecting rod design for minimizing friction and max imizing load bearing capacity of reciprocating crankpin assemblies, such as those found in internal combustion engines. Rather than the conventional journal bearing arrangement, the compressive load between wrist pin and journal center is borne by a hydrostatically supported pivoted pad slider arrangement which operates under mechanical conditions which superimpose pivoted pad slider and squeeze film fluid mechanics to maximize film stability and minimize friction. Inertial loads perpendicular to the wrist pin journal center line are borne by smaller hydrostatically sup ported pivoted pad sliders. Tensile loads are borne by a rela tively flexible rod cap bearing which deflects to maximize squeeze film forces.
