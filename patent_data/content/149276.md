# Method for forming objects from a hardenable material in a mould in particular objects provided with ribs, such as open grids or grids closed on one side as well as moulds adapted to be applied with this method.

## Abstract
The mould is provided with a deformable lining 5 , which is fixed to the mould at least along its edge. This flexible lining 5 can be brought into two positions, i.e. into a first position, in which the mould is in a discharging or a filling position, and into a second position, in which the mould occupies a hardening position. In this hardening position of the mould the interior of the lining 5 , which defines the mould cavity, corresponds with the external shape of the object to be formed, whilst in the discharging or the filling position of the mould both the internal space of the lining and its upper discharge or filling opening are consider ably larger. In the discharging or the filling position of the mould a subatmospheric pressure is exerted on the lower side of the lining 5 , while in order to bring the mould into the hardening position this subatmospheric pressure is released and a support core system 2 accommodated in the mould is at least partially displaced upwardly.

## Description
Method for forming objects from a hardenable material in a mould, in particular objects provided with ribs, such as open grids or grids closed on one side as well as mould adapted to be applied with this method. The invention relates to a method for forming objects from a hardenable material in a mould, in particular objects provided with ribs, such as open grids or grids closed on one side as well as to a mould adapted to be applied with this method. It is an object of the present invention to provide a method, with which it is even possible to manufacture complicated objects in a simple and very quick manner, which objects, when formed in a mould would normally be very difficult to remove from the mould. For this purpose the method according to the invention is characterized in that the mould is provided with a deformable lining, which is fixed to the mould at least along its edge, in such a way that this flexible lining can be brought into two positions, i.e. into a first position, in which the mould is in a discharging or a filling position, and into a second position, in which the mould occupies a hardening position, in which hardening position of the mould the interior of the lining, which defines the mould cavity, corresponds with the external shape of the object to be formed, whilst in the discharging or the filling position of the mould both the internal space of the lining and its upper discharge or filling opening are considerably larger than in the hardening position of the mould in the discharging or the filling position of the mould a subatmospheric pressure being exerted on the lower side of the lining, while in order to bring the mould into the hardening position this subatmospheric pressure is released and a support core system accommodated in the mould is at least partially displaced upwardly the operation of the mould being such, that in the filling position of the mould the hardenable material is fed into the interior of the lining and subsequently the sub atmospheric pressure on the lower side of the lining is released and the lining is brought into its second position by means of the at least partial upward displacement of the support core system, in which second position of the lining the mould is in the hardening position, whereafter, after sufficient hardening of the hardenable material, the mould is brought into the discharging position by means of the at least partial downward displacement of the support core system and the exertion of the subatmospheric pressure on the lower side of the lining, thus causing the lining to be brought back into its first position. Due to the fact that with the method according to the invention the deformable lining has a much larger opening at the upper side in the filling position of the mould than in the hardening position of the mould, the supply of the hardenable material can very quickly and easily take place.Moreover, the hardenable material can comprise longer fibres than would be possible without enlargement of this opening in the filling position of the mould. Because of the application of these longer fibres the object formed obtains a greater strength while maintaining the same percentage of fibres. Therefore, according to the invention an optimal fibre length, or an optimal combination of fibre lengths can be chosen, while the size of the filling opening cannot form any obstruction. After filling, the subatmospheric pressure on the lower side of the lining is released and the support core system is at least partially displaced upwardly. This causes the mould to be brought into the hardening position, in which the mould cavity defined by the interior of the lining, is completely filled with the hardenable material. The possibility may be provided to discharge superfluous hardenable material from the mould in one place, while the remaining portion of the upper opening of the mould cavity is temporarily closed. The flexible lining can be manufactured in such a way, that it will occupy the second position when no forces are exerted thereon, in which second position the mould is in the hardening position. Nevertheless it is alsoWn0efl in this case that the flexible lining is brought from the first position into the second position by means of the at least partially displaceable support core system, as the hardenable material which is fed into the lining, prevents the lining from independently returning to its second position corresponding with the hardening position of the mould, when the subatmospheric pressure is released. After the hardenable material is sufficiently hardened to be discharged, the support core system is at least partially displaced downwardly and at the same time the subatmospheric pressure underneath the flexible lining is applied again. This causes this lining to be peeled from the object formed, which may take place within a few seconds, while furthermore much smaller forces are necessary than would normally be required for the discharging operation.This results in that it is already possible to discharge at an earlier stage of the hardening. Therefore, according to the invention the hardening time as well as the discharging time will be particularly short. By the choice of the configuration of the at least partially displaceable support core system it can be determined, which shape the flexible lining can obtain when the subatmospheric pressure is applied underneath this lining.Because the discharge of the object takes place when the mould cavity, which is defined by the lining, and the upper discharge opening thereof are considerably enlarged, it is possible to manufacture very complicated objects, without any discharge problem arising. It is e.g. possible to apply undercut parts, or certain surface irregularities on the objects, without making the discharge of the objects more difficult. A favourable embodiment of the method according to the invention is characterized in that a support core system is used, which consists of a displaceable portion and a stationary portion. Further it is possible that the mould is vibrated, after the hardenable material is fed into the interior of the lining. Because of the small height of the hardat 4e276 material in the flexible lining, when the mould is in the filling position, the air is very rapidly removed from the material, whereafter the subatmospheric pressure on the underside of the lining is released. The vibration of the mould may be continued, until the displaceable portion of the support core system has been displaced to its highest position. The displaceable portion of the support core system may be heated, if desired, which leads to a quicker hardening. Because during the filling operation this displaceable portion of the support core system remains practically out of contact with the lining and therefore out of contact with the hardenable material, this displaceable portion can be continuously kept at a constant temperature, without the hardenable material already being heated during the filling step. The invention further comprises a mould for forming objects from a hardenable material, in particular objects provided with ribs, such as open grids or grids closed on one side, adapted to be applied with the method described hereinbefore. This mould is characterized by a housing in which a support core system is accommodated, which may be displaced at least partially upwardly and downwardly, a flexible lining being fixed to the mould at least along its edge, while a vacuum pipe is connected to the housing. A favourable embodiment of the mould according to the invention is characterized in that the support core system consists of a displaceable portion and a stationary portion. A horizontal partition wall may be formed in the housing, which partition wall supports the stationary portion of the support core system, while a plurality of vertical suspension rods are passed through openings in this partition wall and are connected on their lower side to a common actuating plate, which is movable upwardly and downwardly by an actuating member, these suspension rods being v f connected on their upper side to the displaceable portion of the support core system. The flexible lining may have lower portions, which are undeformable. The lower undeformable portions of the lining may be displaceable over a predetermined distance in the direction of movement of the displaceable portion of the support core system. As an alternative the lower undeformable portions of the lining may be fixedly connected to the housing. Further the flexible lining may comprise upper portions, which rest on the stationary portion of the support core system. The flexible lining may be provided with a rigid edge portion along its circumference, which edge portion is hermetically sealed with respect to the housing along the entire circumference of the housing. Therefore, due to the fact that the lining is rigid in one plane, it is prevented that a relatively heavy object could break, because of too great a deformation of the lining. The invention will hereinafter be elucidated with reference to the drawings, which show embodiments by way of example of the mould according to the invention. Fig. 1 is a cross section of a first embodiment of the mould according to the invention in the filling position. Fig. 2 is a cross section corresponding withfig. 1, in which the mould is, however, in the hardening position. Fig. 3 is a cross section corresponding with figs.1 and 2, in which the mould is in the discharging position. Fig. 4 is a partial cross section of a second embodiment of the mould according to the invention on a larger scale. Fig. 5 is a top view of an embodiment of a gridshaped object, which has been manufactured in a mould according to figs. 1 3 or according to fig. 4. The drawings show two embodiments of a mould, which in particular serves for forming objects with ribs, such as open grids or grids closed on one side, from a hardenable fluid material, such as e.g. cement mortar or gypsum.Fig. 5 shows an example of such a grid. The mould according to figs. 1 3 comprises a housing 1, in which a support core system 2 is accommodated, of which a displaceable portion 3 can be moved upwardly and downwardly, while the remaining portion 4 is stationary and is connected with the housing 1. A flexible lining 5, which is formed in such a way, that the same, when fully unloaded, has an internal shape, which corresponds with the external shape of the object to be manufactured and which therefore, in this unloaded position, defines the mould cavity 6 fig. 2 , has lower portions 7, which are undeformable, because metal bars 8 combined to a grid are vulcanized in these lower portions. The flexible lining 5 comprises upper portions 9, which rest on the stationary portion 4 of the support core system 2. Along its circumference the flexible lining 5 is further provided with a rigid edge portion 10, in which a metal frame 11 is received and which is connected to the housing 1 in an airtight manner along the entire circumference of the housing 1. A horizontal partition wall 12 is formed in the housing 1, which partition wall 12 supports the stationary portion 4 of the support core system 2, while a plurality of vertical suspension rods 13 are fittingly passed through openings in this partition wall 12. These suspension rods 13 are connected on their lower side to a common actuating plate 14, which is displaceable upwardly and downwardly by an actuating member not shown . The displaceable portion 3 of the support core system 2 is connected to the upper side of these vertical suspension rods 13 and may be moved upwardly and downwardly by displacing the actuating plate 14. Above the partition wall 12 a vacuum pipe 15 is connected to the housing 1, through which vacuum pipe 15 a subatmospheric pressure may be applied on the lower side of the flexible lining 5. The undeformable lower portions 7 of the flexible lining 5 are connected to stop rods 19, which are fittingly passed through the horizontal partition wall 12 and which are provided with an upper stop 20 and a lower stop 21 which define the stroke of the upward and downward movement of the undeformable lower portions 7 of the flexible lining 5. The direction of the displacement of the lower undeformable portions 7 of the flexible lining 5 over a predetermined distance is the same as the direction of movement of the displaceable portion 3 of the support core system 2. In fig. 1 the mould is in its filling position.Through the vacuum pipe 15 a subatmospheric pressure is applied on the lower side of the flexible lining 5, while the movable portion 3 of the support core system 2 is displaced to its lowermost position by means of the actuating plate 14. The e undeformable lower portions 7 of the flexible lining 5 are in their lowermost end position, wherein the upper stops 20 on the stop rods 19 rest on the partition wall 12. In this filling position the space enclosed by the lining 5 is considerably larger than the mould cavity 6 fig. 2 , which is used for forming the object by hardening the hardenable material. As appears from fig. 1, the upper filling opening 16 is very large, so that the supply of the hardenable material in a measured quantity can take place in this filling position of the mould in a very quick and simple manner. Thereupon the mould is vibrated, so that a deaeration of the hardenable material is accomplished. This deaeration takes place very quickly, as a result of the small height of the hardenable material in the flexible lining 5. After the hardenable material is sufficiently deaerated the subatmospheric pressure underneath the lining 5 is released and the movable portion 3 of the support core system 2 is moved upwardly by means of the actuating plate 14, until it has reached its uppermost position shown in fig. 2.The undeformable lower portions 7 of the flexible lining 5 are also displaced to their uppermost end position, wherein the lower stops 21 on the stop rods 19 abut the lower side of the partition wall 12. Hereafter the vibration of the mould is ended and the hardenable material in the lining 5 has obtained the shape of the object 17 to be formed. After a sufficient hardening of the hardenable material has taken place, the movable portion 3 of the support core system 2 is displaced downwardly within a few seconds by displacing the actuating plate 14, while further the subatmospheric pressure underneath the lining 5 is restored again fig. 3 . In this way the lining 5 is peeled from the object 17, which can take place with very low discharging forces. The undeformable lower portions 7 of the flexible lining 5 are also displaced to their lowermost end position, which displacement supports the peeling of the flexible lining 5 from the object. The mould may be vibrated after hardening of the hardenable material, but before the peeling operation, as well as during the peeling step until the removal of the formed object. The movable portion 3 of the support core system 2 can be heated, if desired, which can lead to a further gain of time. Rests of material, if any, can be very easily removed in the discharging position of the mould, while the application of a discharging oil or the like in the filling position can also be particularly simply realized. The configuration of the object to be formed can be chosen at will. In the embodiment shown in the drawing by way of example the flexible lining 5 is shaped in such a manner, that the object may be provided with upper undercuts 18, which are formed in two directions. This will prevent the forming of burrs. The shape of the flexible lining 5 may further be such that the surface of the object to be formed can show any desired pattern of irregularities, since this can no longer hamper the discharge of the object. Fig. 4 shows a part of a second embodiment of the mould according to the invention. The main difference be tween this embodiment and the embodiment according to figs.1 3 consists in that the lower undeformable portions 7 of the flexible lining 5 are fixedly connected to the housing 1. Further this fig. 4 again shows the undercuts 18. In the embodiments shown the displaceable portion of the support core system 2 has side walls, which are parellel. As an alternative it is also possible that these side walls converge in the downward direction. With the mould according to the invention the filling can take place in a very simple and quick manner, while a shorter hardening time is necessary and the object can be discharged very quickly. Therefore, this mould will lead to a great saving of time. Further the hardenable material can comprise long fibres without any problem, which benefits the strength of the formed object. The invention is not restricted to the embodiments shown in the drawings by way of example, which may be varied in several ways within the scope of the invention.
