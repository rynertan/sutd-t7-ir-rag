# Metal containing polyaldehyde microspheres.

## Abstract
A metal containing polyaledehyde microsphere composed of a polyaldehyde microsphere to which a transition metal, e.g. Au, Ag, Pt, Pd, Tc, Fe, Ni or Co, is bound may be obtained in accordance with this invention. The polyaldehyde, e.g. polyacrolein or polyglutaraldehyde, may be encapsulated in agarose, and the mocrosphere may be radioactive or magnetic. The microphere may additionally have a compound having at least one amine group, e.g. a drug, antibody, antigen, enzyme or other protein, bound to its surface. In one embodiment a transition metal is bound to a polyaldehyde microsphere by contacting the polyaldehyde microsphere with a suitable amount of an appropriate salt or acid of the transition metal under suitable conditions so as to cause the salt or acid to be reduced to a lower valence state and to bind to the microsphere. Some salts or acids may thus be reduced to the elemental state others are further reduced with an appropriate reducing agent. In another embodiment, a transition metal in elemental form is bound to a polyaldehyde microsphere by contacting the polyaldehyde microsphere with a suitable amount of a compound capable of complexing with a salt or acid of the transition metal under suitable conditions permitting binding of the compound to the microsphere, contacting the compound with an appropriate amount of an appropriate salt or acid of a transition metal under appropriate conditions permitting the compound to bind to the salt or acid, and reducing the salt or acid to the corresponding elemental metal by contacting it under effective reducing conditions and for a sufficient period of time with a sufficient amount of an effective reducing agent. The metal containing microsphere of the invention is useful for such applications as cell labeling, cell separation, diagnostic methods, catalysis and coating methods.

Heretofore, however, polymeric microspheres containing elemental metals and aldehyde groups available for convenient derivatization of the microspheres with aminoLigands have not been disclosed.It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide such metal containing polyaldehyde micropheres.It is an additional object of this invention to provide methods for preparing such microspheres. It is a further object of this invention to provide methods for using such microspheres in various applications. Summary of the InventionA metal containing polyaldehyde microsphere composed of a polyaldehyde microsphere to which a transition metal, in elemental form is bound maybe obtained in accordance with this invention. The polyaldehyde microsphere may be encapsulated in agarose, and the polyaldehyde is preferably polyacrolein or polyglutaraldehyde. Preferred transition metals include gold, silver, platinum, palladium, technetium, iron, nickel and cobalt. The metal may be a radioactive isotope or may be magnetic. A metalcontaining polyaldehyde microsphere of this invention may additionally have a compound having at least one primary amine group bound to it. Such a compound may be a drug, antibody, antigen, enzyme or other protein. In a preferred embodiment, the compound is an antibody.In one embodiment the transition metal may be bound to a homogeneous polyaldehyde microsphere by a process which includes contacting the polyaldehyde microsphere with a suitable amount of an appropriate salt or acid of the transition metal under suitable conditions and for a sufficient period of time so as to cause the salt or acid of the transition metal to be reduced to a lower valence state by the aldehyde groups of the microsphere and to bind to the microsphere. The polyaldehyde microsphere may be encapsulated in agarose and is preferably a homogeneous microsphere composed of polyacrolein or polyglutaraldehyde. Preferred transition metals include gold, silver, platinum or palladium, and their radioactive isotopes. In a presently preferred embodiment the amount of the salt or acid of the transition metal is about 1 to 6 times the dry weight of the microsphere.Suitable conditions for this process include a pH value between about 2 and 10 and a temperature of up to about 700C. A sufficient period of time for the reaction may be as short as one hour or as long as three months, depending on the metal compound and reaction temperature used. In some cases, e.g., in the case of Au and Ag, the metal is reduced to the elemental state.To achieve reduction to the elemental state in other cases, or to complete the reduction in a shorter time, the salt or acid bound to the microsphere is contacted under effective reducing conditions with a suitable amount of an appropriate reducing agent, e.g. sodium borohydride in an amount of about two times the dry weight of the microsphere.Effective reducing conditions for the process using sodium borohydride include a temperature of about 0 250C, e.g. 40C, and the appropriate period of time is from about 1 to 3 hours.In another embodiment a transition metal in elemental form is bound to a polyaldehyde microsphere by contacting the polyaldehyde microsphere with a suitable amount of a compound containing at least one primary amine group under suitable conditions permitting binding of the compound to the microsphere, the compound being capable of binding to the microsphere and of complexing with a salt or acid of the transition metal contacting the compound with an appropriate amount of an appropriate salt or acid of the transition metal under appropriate conditions permitting the compound to complex with the salt or acid and reducing the salt or acid to the corresponding elemental metal by contacting it under effective reducing conditions and for a sufficient period of time with a sufficient amount of an effective reducing agent, e.g. sodium borohydride. The polyaldehyde microsphere used in this process also may be. encapsulated in agarose and is preferably composed of polyacrolein or polyglutaraldehyde. The preferred transition metals include gold, silver, platinum, palladium, technetium, iron, nickel and cobalt and may be a radioactive isotope or magnetic. Presently preferred compounds capable of binding to the microsphere and of complexing with the salt or acid of the transition metal include deferoxamine, hexanediamine, Fclyethylene imine and N,Ndiethylethylenediamine, suitably in an amount from about 10 to about 150 of the dry weight of the microsphere. An appropriate amount of the salt or acid for use in this process is from about 40 to about 150 of the dry weight of the microsphere.Suitable conditions permitting binding of the compound to the microsphere include a pH value between about 3.0 and 11.0 and a temperature of up to about 700C, e.g. 600C. Appropriate conditions permitting the compound to bind the salt or acid include a temperature from ambient temperature up to about 400C. An effective reducing agent in this process is sodium borohydride, a sufficient amount of which by weight is about two times the dry weight of the microsphere. Effective reducing conditions for the use of sodium borohydride in this process include a temperature of about 0 100C, e.g. 40C, and a sufficient period of time is at least about one hour.Thus, by the processes of this invention a metal containing polyaldehyde microsphere may be obtained and may be magnetic or radiolabeled. Additionally the microsphere may be bound to a compound containing at least one primary amine group, e.g., a drug, antibody, antigen, enzyme or other protein.One embodiment of this invention is a method of labeling a cell which involves contacting the cell with a metal containing polyaldehyde microsphere which additionally has a compound, e.g. an antibody, bound to its surface, the compound, e.g. an antibody, being capable of binding to the cell under suitable conditions. Another embodiment is a method of separating one type of cell from other types of cells which involves contacting the cells with magnetic microspheres of this invention having bound to them a compound, e.g. an antibody, capable of binding to the desired type of cells under suitable conditions and recovering cells bound to the magnetic microspheres.Another embodiment is a diagnostic method for detecting in a biological fluid the presence of an agent associated with a disorder which involves contacting the fluid with a microsphere of this invention having bound to it an antibody capable of reacting with the agent under suitable conditions and determining the occurrence of the reaction.A further embodiment is a method of catalyzing a chemical reaction capable of being catalyzed by a transition metal which involves conducting the reaction in the presence of a catalytically effective amount of metal containing polyaldehyde microspheres of this invention.Still another embodiment is a method for coating various supports with the metal containing microspheres which involves preparing a suspension of the microspheres in an appropriate solvent, coating the support with the suspension and evaporating the solvent. Detailed Description of the InventionA metal containing polyaldehyde microsphere composed of a polyaldehyde microsphere to which a transition metal in elemental form is bound may be obtained in accordance with this invention. In one embodiment, the microsphere is encapsulated in agarose. Agarose encapsulated beads of this type suitably have a diameter between about 40 and 1200 and are compatible with sensitive biological systems such as blood serum.Suitable polyaldehydes in accordance with this invention are numerous and varied, and include all polyaldehydes which can be prepared in the form of powders or microspheres, preferably as microspheres having a diameter between about 0.01it and 100it. Especially preferable are microspheres having a diameter between about 0.04u and about 5.0it. Preferably the polyaldehyde is polyacrolein, polymethacrolein, polycrotonaldehyde or polyglutaraldehyde. Polyacrolein and polyglutaraldehyde are especially preferred. Homopolymers and copolymers known in the art, e.g., with acrylates, acrylamides, vinyl pyridines and their derivatives as comonomers, are suitable for use in accordance with this invention. Preferably, however, the polyaldehyde is a homopolymer.Presently preferred transition metals for binding in elemental form to the microsphere of this invention include gold, silver, platinum, palladium, technetium, iron, nickel and cobalt. The metal may be a radioactive isotope or may be magnetic.In one embodiment of this invention the metal containing polyldehyde microsphere additionally has a compound having at least one primary amine group bound to its surface. Depending on the intended use for the microsphere the compound may be a drug, antibody, antigen, enzyme or other protein. Antibodies in particular, including both serum and monoclonal antibodies, when bound to a microsphere of this invention provide useful reagents for numerous biochemical and medical applications, including cell labeling, cell separation and diagnostic methods. Such a microsphere may also be magnetic as well. In biological applications, the presence of the more inert, elemental metal rather than metal of a higher oxidation state may be advantageous where sensitive biochemical systems are present.Two general approaches are used to prepare the metalcontaining microspheres of this invention. Both involve binding a salt or acid of the desired transition metal to the preformed polyaldehyde microsphere and reducing the metal moiety to the elemental form of the metal. This is in contrast to the methods for producing the prior art metal containing microspheres which involve polymerization in the presence of a metal compound, thereby entrapping the metal compound within the microsphere so produced. By the methods of this invention numerous and varied metals may be attached to the microspheres without adding undue complexity and the attendant possibility of undesired side reactions to the polymerization reaction mixture.One process of the subject invention for binding a transition metal to the polyaldehyde microsphere involves contacting the polyaldehyde microsphere with a suitable amount of an appropriate salt or acid of the transition metal under suitable conditions and for a sufficient period of time so as to cause the salt or acid to be reduced to a lower valence state by the aldehyde groups of the micro sphere and to bind to the microsphere.Suitable microspheres for use in this and other embodiments of this invention include polyaldehyde microspheres which are encapsulated in agarose such as those disclosed inMarcus, Offarim and Margel, Biomat., Med. Dev., Art. Org.10 3 157 171 1982 Margel, FEBS Letters 145 2 341344 1982 Margel and Offarim, Analytical Biochem.128 342 350 1983 and European Patent Application No.83101883.3, filed February 25, 1983 in the name of YedaResearch and Development Co. Ltd., and published September 7, 1983.Suitable polyaldehydes for use in this and other embodiments of the invention are numerous and varied, and include all polyaldehydes which can be prepared in the form of microspheres, preferably having a diameter between about 0.01 and 100p. Especially preferable are microspheres having a diameter between about t.04 and 5.oil. Preferably the polyaldehyde is polyacrolein, polymethacrolein, polycrotonaldehyde or polyglutaraldehyde. Polyacrolein and polyglutaraldehyde are especially preferred. Suitable polyacrolein and polyacrolein type microspheres for use in this invention may be obtained by methods disclosed in Margel, Beitler and Of farim, Immunol. Communications 10 7 567 575 1981 Margel, Beitler and Offarim, J. Cell Sci. 56 157 175 1982 Margel, Ind. Eng.Chem. Prod. Res. Dev. 21 343 348 1982 W. German PatentAppn. No. P3224484.3, filed June 30, 1982 in the name ofYeda Research and Development Co. Ltd., and publishedJanuary 20, 1983 and Rembaum, U.S. Patent No. 4,413,070, filed March 30, 1981 and issued November 1, 1983.Both homopolymeric and copolymeric microspheres are suit able for use in this invention. Copolymeric polyacrolein microspheres and their preparation are disclosed in published W. German Patent Application P3224484.3 and U.S.Patent No. 4,413,070, both of which are cited above.Presently preferred however, are homopolymeric microspheres.Suitable polyglutaraldehyde microspheres for use in this invention may be obtained by the methods of Rembaum andMargel, U.S. Patent No. 4,267,235, filed March 19, 1979 and issued May 12, 1981.Transition metals preferred for use in accordance with this method include gold, silver, platinum and palladium. The metal may be a radioactive isotope. Appropriate salts or acids of such metals include those which may be conveniently reduced, e.g., NaAuC14 or HAuC14 AgNO3, especially with NH3 H2PtC16 and PdC12.In synthesizing the metal containing polyaldehyde microspheres, the suitable amount of the salt or acid of the transition metal may be varied depending on how much metal one wishes to bind to the microspheres, which in turn depends on the intended use for the microspheres. A smaller relative amount of a radioisotope may be used, for instance, to impart a discreet radiolabel to the microspheres. Larger relative amounts of an appropriate metal material may be used to produce microspheres which are more intensely radiolabeled or colored or especially electron dense. In any case, the process is operative over a wide range of concentrations of the metal material. It is limited only in that each microsphere contains a finite number of aldehyde groups to interact with the metal material.In a presently preferred embodiment the suitable amount of the salt or acid of the transition metal is about 1 to 6 times the dry weight of the microspheres.Similarly, a wide range of reaction conditions may be employed in producing the metal containing microspheres.pH values, for example, selected from between about 2 and about 10 are used in several of the preferred embodiments of this invention, as are reaction temperatures up to about 700C. Depending on the particular salt or acid and the reaction temperature, a sufficient period of time for the reaction of the metal material and the polyaldehyde microsphere may be as short as one hour or as long as three months. Elevating the reaction temperature generally permits shorter reaction times. Reaction progress can often be monitored qualitatively by observing a color change indicating that the salt or acid of the metal has been reduced in the presence of the polyaldehyde microsphere.Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the particular color change observed will depend on the particular metal involved. Silver, palladium and platinum, for example, have resulted in black microspheres, while gold has resulted in purple microspheres.In some cases, e.g. in the case of silver and gold compounds, the metal may be reduced to the elemental state by the above described process. To achieve complete reduction, i.e., to the elemental state, in other cases or to complete the reduction in a shorter time, the partially reduced metal salt or acid bound to the microsphere may be contacted with a suitable amount of an appropriate reducing agent under effective reducing conditions. Appropriate reducing agents include borohydride reagents, e.g. sodium borohydride NaBH4 . The suitable amount of the borohydride reagent will depend on the quantity and oxidation state of metal to be reduced. In presently preferred embodiments a suitable amount of sodium borohydride is about two times the dry weight of the microsphere.Suitable conditions for the borohydride reduction include a temperature of about 0 250C, e.g. 40C, and an appropriate period of time is from about 1 to 3 hours.In another aspect of this invention a transition metal in elemental form is bound to a polyaldehyde microsphere in a process involving contacting the polyaldehyde microsphere with a suitable amount of a compound containing at least one primary amine group, under suitable conditions permitting binding of the compound to the microsphere, the compound being capable of binding to the microsphere and of complexing with a salt or acid of the transition metal contacting the compound with an appropriate amount of an appropriate salt or acid of the transition metal under appropriate conditions permitting the compound to bind to the salt or acid and reducing the salt or acid to the corresponding elemental metal by contacting it under effective reducing conditions and for a sufficient period of time with a sufficient amount of an effective reducing agent.A polyaldehyde microsphere which is encapsulated in agarose is also suitable for use in this process. Such agarose encapsulated microspheres are disclosed in, e.g., Margel,Anal. Biochem. 128 342 350 1983 and published EuropeanAppln. No. 83101883.3. Suitable polyaldehydes are, again, those mentioned above, i.e., those which can be prepared in the form of microspheres, preferably having a diameter between about 0.01 and 100 . Especially preferable are microspheres having a diameter between about 0.04 and 5.0 . The polyaldehyde is suitably polyacrolein, polymethacrolein, polycrotonaldehyde or polyglutaraldehyde, e.g., as disclosed by Margel or Rembaum or both in the previously cited papers, patents and published applications. Polyacrolein and polyglutaraldehyde are presently preferred polyaldehydes.Both homopolymeric and copolymeric polyaldehyde microspheres are suitable for use in this process, although homopolymeric microspheres are again preferred.Transition metals which are preferred for use in this process include gold, silver, platinum, palladium, technetium, iron, nickel and cobalt. The metal may be a radioactive isotope or may be magnetic.Compounds suitable for use in this method include those compounds capable of binding to a polyaldehyde microsphere and complexing with a salt or acid of a transition element.Preferably the compound contains at least one primary amine grqup, e.g., deferoxamine or desferal, the mesylate salt thereof and may be a diamine such as hexanediamine orN,N diethylethylenediamine, or a polyamine, such as polyethlene imine. The amount of the compound used may be varied widely depending upon the amount of metal one wishes to bind to the microsphere and the specific compound used. In presently preferred embodiments the amount of the chelating compound is from about 10 to about 150 of the dry weight of the microsphere, again, depending on the extent of the derivitization desired. An appropriate amount of the salt or acid will depend on the amount of chelating compound bound to the microsphere. In presently preferred embodiments the amount is from about 40 to about 150 of the dry weight of the microsphere. Suitable conditions permitting binding of the compound to the microsphere are relatively flexible.In presently preferred embodiments thp suitable pH is a value between about 3.0 and 11.0 and the reaction temperature may be up to about 70 C. In one embodiment the temperature is about 50 70oC, e.g., 600Cand the reaction is complete generally within 12 hours.Complexing of the compound with the salt or acid is effected by contacting the compound bound to the microsphere with an appropriate amount of an appropriate salt or acid of a transition metal under appropriate conditions permitting the compound to complex with the salt or acid. As noted above, an appropriate amount of salt or acid in presently preferred embodiments is from about 40 to about 150 of the dry weight of the microsphere. Appropriate conditions permitting the compound to bind to the salt or acid vary depending on the compound bound to the microsphere and the metal compound to be complexed.Preferably the conditions comprise a temperature from ambient temperature up to about 600C, e.g., 400C. The salt or acid thus complexed with the compound bound to the microsphere is then reduced to the corresponding elemental metal by contacting it under effective reducing conditions and for a sufficient period of time with a sufficient amount of an effective reducing agent. While various reducing agents may be employed, borohydride reagents, e.g. NaBH4, are preferred. The sufficient amount of NaBH4 will again depend on the amount and oxidation state of the metal to be reduced. In presently preferred embodiments the amount of NaBH4 is about two times the dry weight of the microsphere.Effective reducing conditions in preferred embodiments include a temperature of about 0 250C, e.g. about 40C, and a sufficent period of time for completion of the reaction is at least about one hour.By these processes a metal containing polyaldehyde microsphere of this invention is produced. The microsphere may be. radioactive or magnetic and, may also have bound to it a compound containing at least one primary amine group.Binding to an amino compound, e.g., a drug, antibody, antigen, enzyme or other protein, is readily effected by contacting the metal containing microsphere with the compound at a temperature of up to 700C for up to about 12 hours. Where the compound is sensitive to elevated temperatures, however, binding may be conducted readily at reduced temperature, e.g. at about 40C in about 2 hours.Alternatively, the compound containing the primary amine group may be bound to the polyaldehyde microsphere under the same reaction conditions, but before the transition metal is bound to the microsphere. It should be understood that where the microsphere is bound to the metal via a compound capable of complexing with a metal salt or acid that the drug, antibody, antigen, etc. will constitute a second compound containing at least one primary amine group which is bound to the microspheres.The metal containing microspheres of this invention are useful in a variety of applications. One embodiment of this invention is a method of labeling a cell which involves contacting the cell with a metal containing polyaldehyde microsphere, the microsphere having bound to it a compound being capable of binding to the cell under suitable conditions. Mouse splenocytes, for example, may be labeled by this method with gold containing polyacrolein microspheres of 0.1 average diameter which have bound to them goat antimouse antibodies. The splenocytes are labeled by shaking them with the microspheres at 40C for one hour. The splenocytes labeled by this method are dark red in color when viewed under a microscope.Another embodiment is a method of separating one type of cell from other types of cells. The method involves contacting the cells with magnetic metal containing polyaldehyde microspheres of this invention having bound to them a compound capable of binding to the desired type of cell under suitable conditions and recovering the cells bound to the magnetic microspheres. Preferably the compound is an antibody. By this method human red blood cells may be separated from turkey red blood cells using ironcontaining polyacrolein microspheres which have goat antirabbit IgG bound to them. In accordance with this method a mixture of turkey red blood cells and human red blood cells first treated with rabbit anti human red blood cell antibody were shaken with the goat anti rabbit derivatized microspheres. The mixture was then separated in a magnetic field.By this method cells bound to the magnetic microspheres were separated, and more than 95 of the separated cells were found to be human red blood cells.An additional embodiment of this invention is a diagnostic method for detecting in a biological fluid the presence of an agent associated with a disorder. This method involves contacting the fluid with a metal containing microsphere of this invention which additionally has bound to it an antibody capable of reacting with the agent under suitable conditions and determining the occurrence of the reaction.By this method, for example, human chorionic gonodotropin HCG may be detected in urine with gold containing microspheres which have bound to them rabbit anti human chorionic gonadotropin antibody. The agglutination reaction between the microsphere bound antibody and the HCG in the urine results in a color change in the suspension which can be measured spectrophotometrically, and correlated with the presence of the agent, HCG.An additional application of the microspheres of this invention involves a method for catalyzing a chemical reaction capable of being catalyzed by a transitional metal. In accordance with this method the chemical reaction is conducted in the presence of a catalytically effective amount of polyaldehyde microspheres to which an appropriate transition metal in elemental form is bound. By this method the hydrogenation of double bonds may be effected with hydrogen gas at ambient temperature and pressure in the presence of platinum containing microspheres. A further use of the microspheres of this invention is in a method for coating a support with metal containing polyaldehyde microspheres. According to this method a suspension of the microspheres is prepared in an appropriate solvent. The support is coated with the suspension and the solvent is evaporated. By this method films of various thicknesses may be prepared which may then be used in place of the free microspheres.This invention is illustrated in the examples which follow.The examples are set forth to aid in an understanding of the invention but are not intended to, and should not be construed to, limit in any way the invention as set forth in the claims which follow thereafter.
