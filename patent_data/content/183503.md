## Description
This invention relates to conjugates of pharmaceutically useful proteins. Conjugates of proteins and water soluble polymers have been prepared for a wide range of pharmaceutical purposes. Attachment of one or more polymer molecules usually has the effect of interfering with interactions between the protein and other macromolecules or cells. Thus the antigenicity or allergenicity of the protein is diminished or its clearance from the bloodstream is prolonged. For example, the plasma clearance of urokinase has been prolonged by the irreversible attachment of methoxy polyethylene glycol. Alternatively, the conjugate may have novel properties for example, European Patent No.0,038,154 discloses conjugates of allergens with polysarcosine which have immunosuppressive properties. The attachment of polymers to proteins to retard clearance or decrease antigenicity is of most use for proteins, usually enzymes, which act on low molecular weight substrates. If the protein, in order to produce a therapeutic effect, requires to act on a macromolecular or cell bound substrate then it might be expected that the attachment of polymers would interfere with this interaction, resulting in a loss of activity. Such an effect has been demonstrated with streptokinase and polyethylene glycol where decreased antigenicity was only attained at the expense of a decrease in fibrinolytic activity. Frequently, even if the protein acts on low molecular weight substrates, a decrease in activity upon polymer attachment is encountered. EP 0098110 discloses irreversible conjugates of a physiologically active polypeptide or glycoprotein coupled to a polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene copolymer effective in vivo for a prolonged period of time. FR 2515684 discloses irreversible conjugates of a plasminogen activator to at least one polyalkylene glycol attached by means of at least one coupling agent to amino acid side chains of the plasminogen activator. EP191772 priority 29.08.84, filed 23.05.85 discloses the use of reversible linking agents of formulae A and B hereafter, based on a maleic anhydride, for linking the amino nitrogen of an amino group containing substance such as a peptide or protein to a sulphydryl function of a second compound which may be a polymer. According to the present invention there is provided a conjugate comprising a pharmaceutically useful protein linked to at least one water soluble polymer by means of a reversible linking group, provided that the linking group is not derived from a cross linking reagent of formula A where R where R As used herein, the expression pharmaceutically useful protein means a protein which produces a therapeutic or pharmacological effect in the human or animal body. The expression reversible linking group means a linkage which is broken under This type of conjugate gives rise to sustained release of active protein. The conjugates may be represented by the general formula I The number of water soluble polymer molecules which can be linked to the protein in this way and which will remove the undesirable property for example, antigenicity, fast clearance depends upon the nature of the protein and can be determined by routine methods. However, the degree of modification of the protein by the reversible linkage of the polymer molecules i.e. the number of polymer molecules linked to the protein is of less importance than in the case of irreversible polymer protein conjugates. Each protein molecule may have more than one linking group attached to it, and each linking group may have more than one water soluble polymer attached thereto. The molecular weights of the water soluble polymers p should preferably be in the range 500 to 10⁶, most preferably in the range 2,000 to 20,000. Examples of a suitable water soluble polymer P , include the polyamino acids or polyimino acids such as polysarcosine, poly D,L alanine, polyhydroxyproline, or the polysaccharides and their derivatives, for example, dextran, hydroxyethyl starch or Ficoll, or optionally derivatised synthetic polymers such as polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, the polyvinyl pyrrolidones, the polyvinylalcohols or the polyacrylamides. Suitably the water soluble polymer P is methoxy polyethylene glycol. The pharmaceutically useful protein X may be an enzyme,a pro enzyme or a non enzymatic protein. Suitable non enzymic proteins include the interferons, the lymphokines particularly interleukin 2 , Protein A from Examples where the pharmaceutically useful protein X is an enzyme or pro enzyme include the proteases together with their pro enzymes which are involved in haemostasis, fibrinolytic enzymes and their pro enzymes, arginase, uricase, asparaginase, glutaminase, superoxide dismutase and enzymes which are absent in patients suffering various enzyme deficiency diseases, for example hexosaminidase A and glucocerebrosidase. In a particularly preferred embodiment the pharmaceutically useful protein X is a fibrinolytic enzyme or pro enzyme thereof, in which case the linking group may also be derived from a reversible linking agent of formula A or B . The term fibrinolytic enzyme as used herein means any enzyme which demonstrates in vivo fibrinolytic activity as defined in European Patent No. 0,009,879 US4285932 . These enzymes may be prepared by tissue culture, extraction from blood, urine or tissues, or by recombinant DNA methodologies. Examples of such enzymes are the plasminogen activators including tissue plasminogen activator such as melanoma plasminogen activator, urokinase both high and low molecular weight and the single chain form , and complexes of streptokinase with plasmin. Suitable pro enzymes include pro urokinase and pro tissue plasminogen activator. The class of pharmaceutically useful proteins defined above as fibrinolytic enzymes and pro enzymes thereof also includes The fibrinolytic enzymes may optionally be blocked at their active centres as described in the European Patent No. 0,009,879 US 4285932 . The linking group L is such that the linkage is broken under The cleavage of the linking group L may occur by hydrolysis or by intra molecular rearrangement. It may take place within the linking group L itself or at the boundary of the linking group L with the polymer or with the protein. Preferably the cleavage should give rise to unmodified protein. A suitable linking group L is based on substituted maleic acids. The conjugates formed can be represented by the general formula II where X is as hereinbefore defined and the NH moiety is derived from a protein amino group in X and either In neutral and acidic solutions, including physiological condition of pH 7.4 and 37 Examples of suitable bridging groups R₃ include straight or branched C₁ ₁₀ aliphatic hydrocarbon chains which are optionally interrupted or terminated by an amide or ester moiety or by at least one hetero atom selected from oxygen, sulphur or nitrogen, optionally substituted by a C₁ ₆ alkyl group. Preferably R₃ contains an electron donating moiety adjacent to the double bond, such as methylene. Examples of suitable groups R₃ P include P CH₂ Suitable non polymeric organic groups for R₁, R₂, R₄ and R₅ include aliphatic C₁ ₁₀ hydrocarbon groups optionally interrupted or terminated by a heteroatom selected from oxygen, sulphur or nitrogen optionally substituted by a C₁ ₆ alkyl group. Preferably the non polymeric organic group contains an electron donating moiety adjacent to the double bond, such as methylene or methyl. Examples of such groups for R₁, R₂, R₄ and R₅ include R₆, R₆ O or R₆ ₂N , wherein R₆ is straight or branched C₁ ₆ alkyl. In particular R₁, R₂, R₄ or R₅ could be CH3, CH₃CH₂ , CH₃ ₂CH , CH₃CH₂CH₂ , CH₃ ₃C ,CH₃O , CH₃CH₂O or CH₃ ₂N . There is a sub group of conjugates within formula II of formula IIA , in which R₁ and R₂ are each a non polymeric organic group or a group of formula R₃ P as hereinbefore defined provided that at least one of R₁ and R2 is a group R₃ P. In conjugates of formula IIA , preferably one of R₁ and R₂ is a group P CH₂ and the other is methyl. Examples of conjugates of formula II wherein R₁ and R₂ are joined together included cyclic structures of formula IIB wherein r, s and t are each independently zero, one or two provided that r s t is greater than 0 and less than 4, i.e. an integer of 1 to 3, and R₄ and R₅ are as hereinbefore defined Alternatively R₁ and R₂ may be joined together to form an aromatic structure. Examples of such conjugates of formula II include conjugates of formula IIC wherein R₄ and R₅ are as defined above in relation to formula II . Suitable non polymeric organic groups for R₄ or R₅ in formulae IIB and IIC include those described above under formula II . Further according to the present invention there is provided a process for preparing a conjugate as described above, which process comprises reacting a pharmaceutically useful protein with a water soluble polymer containing reagent comprising a group which is capable of reacting with a protein amino group or derivative thereof, to form a reversible linking group as hereinbefore defined. The polymer containing reagent may be represented by the formula III The conditions used to prepare the conjugates will depend on the nature of the polymeric reagent, the protein and the stability of the linkage formed and will be apparent to the skilled man. Suitably, the protein is dissolved in an aqueous buffer preferably at a moderately alkaline pH e.g. pH 7.0 9.5 and at a temperature in the range 0 40 The amount of the water soluble polymer containing reagent formula III used determines the number of polymer molecules which become attached to the protein. At least a molar excess of reagent formula III should be added. After the reaction is complete, excess reagent and unwanted reaction products may be removed. Suitable removal techniques include ammonium sulphate precipitation, dialysis, diafiltration or a number of chromatographic procedures, for example, gel filtration, ion exchange chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography or affinity chromatography. For fibrinolytic enzymes and other serine proteases, affinity chromatography on benzamidine Sepharose is a particularly preferred procedure. For fibrinolytic enzymes optional blocking at their active centres may be performed either before or after the polymer conjugation reaction. The type of linkage illustrated in the conjugate of formula II is suitably obtained by reaction of reagents of formula IV wherein R₁ and R₂ are as hereinbefore defined, with an amino group Of a pharmaceutically useful protein. It will be appreciated that the conjugate of formula II thus formed will exhibit isomerism at the linkage if R₁ R₂ since the protein amino group could, in principle, react with either carbonyl group. GB1390716 discloses certain compounds of formula III and IV which are a polyalkyleneetherpolyol ester of trimellitic anhydride having the formula C where R Novel reagents of formulae III and IV form part of the invention. A reagent of the formula IV may be prepared by the reaction of a compound of formula IVA where A¹ and A² are each hydroxy groups or together are O , B¹ and B² together are a bond or are groups susceptible to elimination to form a bond, and either Preferably in the compound of formula IVA , groups A¹ and A² together are O and groups B¹ and B² together are a bond. The nature of the groups W and Y and consequently the reaction conditions employed, is determined by the bridging group R₃ to be provided. Where the bridging group is an aliphatic hydrocarbon chain containing a heteroatom as aforesaid, the groups Y and W are each hydrocarbon chains of appropriate length and terminated respectively by the appropriate nucleophilic heteroatom O, S or N and a suitable leaving group such as halide preferably bromo or iodo , methanesulphonyl or 4 toluenesulphonyl. Where the bridging group R₃ is a aliphatic hydrocarbon chain, the group Y is a terminal nucleophilic heteroatom on the polymer P and the group W is the corresponding hydrocarbon chain derivatised by a suitable leaving group. The reaction conditions for the nucleophilic displacement of the leaving group in these cases are conventional and will be determined mainly by the polymer. Thus, when the nucleophile is O , the reaction may be carried out in any refluxing non polar solvent under an atmosphere of dry nitrogen until the reaction is complete. Where the bridging group is a aliphatic hydrocarbon chain containing an amide or ester moiety, the groups W and Y are each hydrocarbon chains of appropriate length, one terminated by a carboxyl function and the other by an hydroxyl or an amino function. The reaction conditions are conventional conditions for the formation of a ester or amide linkage, such as by activating the acid under non aqueous conditions with a suitable activator, for example dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, and subsequent reaction with the appropriate alcohol or amine. The derivatisation of the polymer P to give a compound of formula IVB may be carried out by conventional procedures, as may the preparation of a compound of formula IVA . A particularly suitable reagent of formula IV is the anhydride of formula V wherein P is as hereinbefore defined. The mode of attachment of the water soluble polymer P to the linking group L will depend on the chemical nature of the polymer. Thus if P is methoxypolyethylene glycol in formula V , the reagent is suitably of formula VI If the polymer is polysarcosine, a suitable reagent is of formula VII In formulae VI and VII , P and m are each integers such that the molecular weight of the polymer falls within the above described range. Other polymers may have to be derivatised in conventional manner before a suitable connection to the linking group can be made. A further suitable reagent of formula IV is the anhydride of formula VIII wherein P is as hereinbefore defined. The mode of attachment of the P groups will be as described above under formula IV . The protein conjugate of this invention is preferably administered as a pharmaceutical composition. Accordingly, the present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising the conjugate of the invention in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The compositions will generally be formulated in the same or similar manner to the formulated proteins per se. This may include tablets, capsules, creams, syrups, suspensions, solutions, reconstitutable powders and sterile forms suitable for injection or infusion. Such compositions may contain pharmaceutically acceptable materials such as diluents, binders, colours, flavours, preservatives, disintegrates and the like in accordance with conventional pharmaceutical practices. The protein in the composition of the invention will normally be administered at approximately the amount at which it is conventionally used. The mg kg dosage is adjusted appropriately upwards to take account of the polymer molecules linked thereto, and the potency and pharmacokinetics of the conjugate. When the pharmaceutically useful protein X is a fibrinolytic enzyme, the compositions according to the invention are formulated in accordance with routine procedures as pharmaceutical compositions adapted for intravenous administration to human beings. Typically compositions for intravenous administration are solutions of the sterile derivative in sterile isotonic aqueous buffer. Where necessary the composition may also include a solubilising agent to keep the conjugate in solution and a local anaesthetic such a lignocaine to ease pain at the site of injection. Generally, the conjugate will be supplied in unit dosage form for example as a dry powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of protein in activity units, as well as an indication of the time within which the free protein will be liberated. Where the conjugate is to be administered by infusion, it will be dispensed with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade Water for Injection or saline. Where the conjugate is to be administered by injection, it is dispensed with an ampoule of sterile water for injection. The injectable or infusable composition will be made up by mixing the ingredients prior to administration. The precise dose to be employed and mode of administration must No toxicity has so far been observed or is indicated within the above described dose ranges. According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a method of treating a sufferer in need of a pharmaceutically useful protein as hereinbefore defined, which method comprises administering to the sufferer an effective non toxic amount of a protein conjugate of the invention. In particular there is provided a method of treating thrombotic diseases, which comprises administering to the sufferer an effective non toxic amount of a fibrinolytic enzyme conjugate as described above. The invention also provides a conjugate of the invention for use as an active therapeutic substance. The invention further provides a conjugate in which the pharmaceutically useful protein is a fibrinolytic enzyme or pro enzyme for use as an active therapeutic substance and in particular for use in the treatment of thrombotic diseases. The following Examples illustrate the invention. In the following Examples it is to be noted that there are two potential linkage points for the protein on the linking group i.e. the two carboxyl functions of the maleic anhydride derivative , and no attempt has been made to distinguish between them although, for convenience, only one of the two potential isomers has been named and illustrated. In the figures To a stirred solution of HSA Sigma, 20 mg in 0.1 M sodium pyrophosphate HCl, 0.01 Tween 80, pH 7.4 buffer 2.0 ml at room temperature was added 2 methoxypolyethylene 5000 glycoxymethylene 3 methyl maleic anhydride 400 mg , maintaining the pH at 8.0 by addition of 0.1 M NaOH. After base uptake has ceased, a portion was analyzed by HPLC gel filtration. The modified HSA eluted as a broad peak corresponding in appearent molecular weight to the albumin dimer viz. 130,000 Fig. 1b . The relevant fractions were pooled. Reversibility was studied at pH 5.0 since deacylation is more rapid at this pH. A portion of the conjugate pool was adjusted to pH 5.0 with dilute HCl and incubated at 37 A solution of tissue plasminogen activator t PA in 0.02 M NaH₂PO₄ Na₂HPO₄, 0.3 M NaCl, 0.1 M 4 guanidinobutyric acid, 0.01 Tween 80, pH 7.4 was obtained from cultured human melanoma cell supernatant by zinc chelate chromatography, affinity chromatography on lysine Sepharose, gel filtration on Sephadex G25, repeat lysine Sepharose chromatography, PEG dialysis, gel filtration on Sephadex G25 and repeat PEG dialysis to a concentration of 120,000 SU ml ca. 1mg ml . This solution 1 ml was then gel filtered on Sephadex G25M PD 10, Pharmacia into 0.1 M sodium pyrophosphate buffer pH 8.0 containing 0.1 M 4 guanidinobutyric acid and 0.01 Tween 80 1.5 ml . The solution was stirred well at room temperature and three 250 mg portions of 2 methoxy polyethylene 5000 glycoxymethylene 3 methylmaleic anhydride were added at ca. 2 minute intervals, maintaining the pH at 8.0 by addition of 0.2 M NaOH from an autoburette Radiometer . After base uptake had ceased, the solution was gel filtered at 4 The extent and reversibility of the modification was assessed by hplc Fig. 3 . The PEG t PA conjugate eluted as a broad peak with an apparent molecular weight of 130,000. After 21 hours at 37 Urokinase was assayed against the chromogenic substrate S 2444 KabiVitrum, Sweden at a concentration of 1 mM in 0.1 M triethanolamine.HCl pH 8.0 at 25 Into a cuvette was placed 10 mM S 2251 KabiVitrum, Sweden in 0.1 M triethanolamine buffer pH 7.0 25 µl , 10 mg ml lys plasminogen KrabiVitrum, Sweden and treated with aprotinin agarose and the test activator at an appropriate concentration 5 µI . These were added to the cuvette without allowing the solutions to mix. To a blank cuvette was added the above solutions with the exception of the activator. The assay was initiated by addition of 0.1 M triethanolamine buffer pH 8.0 1 ml to both cuvettes and the OD₄₀₅ test v. blank monitored. The initial slope of a plot of OD against time² was taken as an arbitrary measure of the rate of plasminogen activation. This was performed using a Packard auto gamma scintillation spectrometer. Analytical gel filtration HPLC was performed on a column SW 60 CM of TSK G3000 SW equilibrated with 0.08 M Na₂HPO₄ NaH₂PO₄ 0.32 M NaCl buffer pH 7.0 containing 20 ethanol using a flow rate of 0.75 ml min. Molecular weight calibration was achieved with standard proteins from Biorad. Blood 40 ml was taken from human volunteers and mixed with 0.1 volumes 129 mM trisodium citrate. Plasma was prepared by centrifugation at 1700 g for 15 min at 4 An aliquot 0.5 ml of plasma was recalcified to a final concentration of 25 mM using CaCl₂ and was supplemented with approx. 3.7x10³ Bq 0.1 µCi ¹²⁵I fibrinogen repurified by ammonium sulphate precipitation from material supplied by the Radiochemical Centre, Amersham specific radioactivity 3.7x10⁶ Bq mg 100 µCi mg . The supplemented plasma was clotted onto a Nickel chrome wire coil using 50 µl bovine thrombin 50 NIH units ml in 0.9 NaCl . Clots were matured at 25 The clots were counted for ¹²⁵I and then incubated in 3 5 ml homologous plasma, with addition of plasminogen activator, where appropriate, at 37 Male Dunkin Hartley guinea pigs 350 450 g were anaesthetized with urethane 25 w v solution 6 ml kg i.p. . One carotid artery was cannulated for collection of blood samples. One femoral vein was cannulated for injection of heparin 50 U kg i.v. and compound under test. Approximately 5 min after heparinization, a pre dose blood sample 2 ml was taken and mixed with 0.1 volumes 129 mM trisodium citrate. The compound under test was then injected 1 ml kg over 10s. Further blood samples were taken exactly 2, 4, 8, 16, 30, 60 and 90 min later. Heparin treatment 50 U kg i.v. was repeated after the 30 min sample to maintain cannula patency. All citrated blood samples were kept on ice until the end of each experiment, then centrifuged at 1700 g for 15 min at 4 A urokinase conjugate prepared as described in Example 3 ii was compared with urokinase in the Fig. 5 shows the clearance of urokinase and the conjugate described in Example 3 ii from the bloodstream of guinea pigs. Clearly, addition of polyethylene glycol to the urokinase has caused markedly prolonged clearance.
