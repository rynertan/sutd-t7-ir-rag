# Precision time duration detector.

## Abstract
A detector for determining whether the time du ration t₂ t₁ between two events, such as a positive and a negative peak of a waveform, is greater or less than a predetermined time interval T₀ , comprises a delay line 20 for delaying the waveform by the predeter mined time interval T₀ . A peak detector 22 of a first polarity for detecting the first occurring peak of the waveform is responsive to the delayed waveform to provide a signal S₁ t T₀ , S₃ t at the occurrence of its first peak. A peak detector 21 of a second polarity detects the second peak of the undelayed waveform and providing a signal S₂ t at the occurrence of its second peak. A time sequence comparator 23 provides a first output when the signal S₃ t from the first peak detector 22 occurs prior to the signal S₂ t from the second peak detector 21 and a second output when the signal S₃ t from the second peak detector 21 oc curs prior to the signal S₂ t from the first peak detec tor 22 . In another embodiment, one of the outputs of a combined peak detector is delayed and applied together with the undelayed other output to the time sequence comparator.
