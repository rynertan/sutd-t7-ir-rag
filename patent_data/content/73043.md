# Time domain multiplexer.

## Abstract
In order to enhance the general purposeness of a time domain multiplexer for digital channel signals of unequal bit rates, the time domain multiplexer is construced of a plurality of channel units 7 which provide information signals and bit rate signals of input channel signals, a plurality of logic circuits 37 . . . 45 which multiplex the information signals from the channel units 7 , and a control circuit 46 . . . 50 which selects and combines the logic circuits 37 . . . 45 in accordance with the bit rate signal so as to construct a multiplexer conforming with the bit rate.
