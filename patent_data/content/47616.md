# Bag for receiving a pumped liquid and method of using it.

## Abstract
A bag 1 particularly for receiving a pumped settable liq uid which when set forms a solid block. The bag is substantially air tight and is filled at a rate which pressurises the air trapped in the bag so as to cause the bag to expand up to its full size. Over pressurisation is prevented by a relief valve in the bag formed by a seam which is weaker than the other seams.

A bag for receiving a pumped liquid, comprising side walls, a top end and a bottom end, all made of a flexible air tight material sealed at its seams in a substantially air tight manner, a liquid entry pipe 2 sealed through the material of the bag at the top thereof, and a pressure relief valve at the top of the bag which releases air trapped in the bag if the air pressure exceeds a predetermined value. 2. A bag according to claim 1, wherein the pressure relief valve is formed by a seam in the material at the top of the bag which has a lower tensile strength than the other seams in the top and side walls of the bag. 3. A bag according to claim 2, wherein the seam forming the pressure relief valve is produced by welding together raised edges of material around a hole, and the said other seams are produced by welding together overlapping edges of material. 4. A bag according to any preceding claim, wherein a rope is secured to the material of the bag around the top thereof and a plurality of hooks 5 are attached to the rope for suspending the bag from a support. 5. A bag according to any preceding claim, wherein the liquid entry pipe is sealed through a hole in a protruding portion of the bag and the raised edges of material around the hole are clamped against the outside of the pipe by a clamping ring 3 . 6. A method of forming a solid block from a settable liquid, comprising pumping the liquid through a pipe 2 sealed into the top of a substantially air tight bag 1 at a rate such that air trapped in the bag is pressurised and expands the bag to its full size, the air pressure in the bag being limited by a relief valve which gradually releases trapped air and allows the liquid to completely fill the bag.

## Description
Bag for receiving a pumped liquid and method of using it. The present invention relates to a bag for receiving a pumped liquid and to a method of forming a solid block using such a bag. In the mining industry it is frequently necessary to construct support walls or barriers underground and a conventional method of doing this is to form blocks from a material based on a mixture of two liquids, one a special cement and water mix and the other a special bentonite and water mix, which when mixed together rapidly solidify. Large blocks are formed by pumping the two liquids into shaped sewn bags of waterproof fabric which are suspended in the required position from a supporting framework.These bags typically have a volume of at least 4m3 and hold between 3 x 103 and 104 kg of material so that any distortion of the bag during its filling caused by folds becoming trapped beneath the solid and liquid mass can overstress and damage the suspension of the bag and can also produce tears in the bag resulting in leakage and incomplete filling of the bag. According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a bag for receiving a pumped liquid, comprising side walls, a top end and a bottom end all made of a flexible air tight material sealed at its seams in a substantially air tight manner, a liquid entry pipe sealed through the material of the bag at the top thereof, and a pressure relief valve at the, top of the bag which relases air trapped in the bag if the air pressure exceeds a predetermined value. According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of forming a solid block from a settable liquid, comprising pumping the liquid through a pipe sealed into the top of a substantially air tight bag at a rate such that air trapped in the bag is pressurised and expands the bag to its full size, the air pressure in the bag being limited by a relief valve which gradually releases trapped air and allows the liquid to completely fill the bag. A bag and method of forming a solid block using such a bag, according to the present invention, will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 shows a perspective view of the bag and Figure 2 shows a section through two types of seam used in the bag of Figure 1. Referring to Figure 1 of the drawings, the bag 1 is made from a fire resistant, anti static, light weight, air tight, P.V.C. coated polyester tear resistant fabric of a type approved for use in mines. The bag is generally rectangular in shape having side walls a top end and a bottom end, and is formed from one or more sheets of theP.V.C. coated fabric welded together in a substantially air tight manner. An inlet pipe 2 is sealed through a hole in the top of the bag. A flexible plastics strip 4 of omega shaped cross section enclosing a loop of steel wire rope is welded around the top of the bag and hooks 5 are secured through the strip 4 and around the steel wire rope at intervals to provide suspension points for the bag. The bag 1 is sachet shaped and is formed by first taking a rectangular piece of the P.V.C. coated fabric and welding one edge to the opposite edge so as to form a tube.An overlapping seam as shown in Figure 2A is used to join the two edges and not a raised seam as in Figure 2B since the tensile strength of an overlapping seam for the same width of seam is approximately ten times that of a raised seam. The ends of the tube are then folded inwards at opposite edges to form the top and bottom of the bag and each pair of opposite edges joined along almost their whole length by an overlapping welded seam so as to leave only a small hole in a protruding flap of the fabric at each end of the top and bottom of the bag. The two holes at the bottom of the bag are closed by welding the fabric around each of the holes together in a raised seam as in Figure 2B and folding the protruding flap of the fabric down so that it can be welded flat against the bottom of the bag.One of the two holes in the top of the bag is similarly closed with the flap 6 welded down onto the top of the bag. The other hole is enlarged by cutting off the end of the protruding flap and the rubber inlet pipe 2 is ihserted into the hole and sealed to the bag by gripping the fabric around the hole onto the outside of the inlet pipe with a screw tightened metal clamping ring 3 of the type known as a Jubilee Clip . This provides a simple fixing method at a position where the fabric adjacent the inlet pipe remains reasonably equally stressed during filling of the bag so as not to put excessive tension on the fabric beneath the clamping ring 3. The cmega section strip 4 with its enclosed steel wire rope is welded onto the outside of the bag around the top. In use the empty bag is suspended from a conventional support framework by the hooks 5 and the outlet nozzle of a mixer supplying a pumped mixture of cement water and bentonite water at a rate of approximately 100 litres per minute is connected to the inlet pipe 2. As the bag begins to fill the air trapped above the solidifying liquid in the bag which leaks out much slower than the liquid enters will be compressed and hence pressurised. This air pressure will force the bag to expand thus removing any folds or creases left in the bag and preventing them from causing any uneven filling of the bag. Also where the bag is to be used to form a roof supporting block the air pressure will force the bag up against the roof so that the filling material can extend all the way to the roof. As the air pressure within the bag rises it will eventually reach a level where the seams in the bag may fail. Since the overlapping seams are much stronger than the raised seams, it is at one of the holes closed by raised seams that the bag will be expected to burst. The two of these on the bottom of the bag will, by this time, be protected by a substantial covering of solidified filling material which leaves the raised seam in the top flap 6. as the weakest point in the bag and this therefore acts as a pressure relief valve when the pressure reaches the level at which the raised seam fails. There will be a controlled release of the trapped air through the open seam, maintaining the pressure in the bag, until the bag is completely filled. The steel wire rope in the plastics strip 4 distributes the loading on the hooks 5 and even if, during the filling of the bag, there is an uneven loading so that one of the hooks 5 pulls away from the bag the load will simply be partly transferred through the wire to the adjacent hooks without damaging the bag itself. The bags made of a size and shape suitable for the block required and where the size is such that more than one sheet of fabric is needed to make the bag, the sheets are joined with overlapping welded seams so as to maintain the strength of the bag. The volume of the bag may be as small as 0.5m3. In some cases it may not be necessary to suspend the bag in which case the steel wire nope and hooks may be omitted. Whilst the bag has been described for use with a mixture of cement water and bentonite water it may slso be used with other pumped liquids such as liquid cement, concrete or gypsum based materials.
