# Method and apparatus for radio frequency drying of textile material.

## Abstract
Textile material to be dried is mounted in an apparatus on a plurality of supports 1 . The supports are moved along a predetermined path, and suction and radio frequency energy are applied to the material, to dry it. A pump 10a which can pump both liquid and vapour draws air through the material to remove water. A valve 12 is associated with the suction duct 2 leading to each sup port, and these valves are adjusted as the supports move along the path, so that a maximum amount of suction is applied to the wet material and a lesser amount of suction to the drier material.
