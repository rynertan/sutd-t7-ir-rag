# Cocoa powder, cocoa bean mass and process for their production.

## Abstract
Cocoa powder, cocoa bean mass and a process for their production by proceeding from press cake produced in the countries of origin and being of varying quality, are de scribed. Cocoa powder and cocoa bean mass having a bacterial count far below that of the conventional products are achieved in that the press cake, after crushing into particles and adjustment of its water content and pH and or the addition of other conventional substances affecting the coloration and flavour of the cocoa, are sterilized and dried. For the production of cocoa powder, the dry particles are cooled, whereupon their aroma and fat content are adjusted before they are pulverized and tempered in conventional manner. For the production of cocoa bean mass, the sterilized, dry cocoa particles are mixed with a selected edible fat, such as cocoa butter, and optionally other additives having a given low bacterial count, before impart ing to said mass a fineness of 99 below 100 µm and tempering and blocking said mass in conventional manner.

## Description
COCOA POWDER, COCOA BEAN MASS AND PROCESS FOR THEIR PRODUCTION The present invention relates to cocoa powder and cocoa bean mass of good bacteriological standard, and to a process for their production by proceeding from natur aSl pres5 cake from the countries of origin. In the present specification and claims, the term cocoa bean mass also comprises novel types of bean masses which may comprise edible fats other than cocoa butter. In the production of cocoa powder and cocoa bean mass, one proceeds from the fruits of the tropical cacao tree, the beans of which are fermented and dried. The beans are then roasted in plants.at a predetermined temperature and for a predetermined period of time in order to develop and refine their inherent cocoa aroma, whereupon the beans are cracked and dehusked in special winnowing machines. In the production of alkalized cocoa powder, the nibs are heat treated with the addition of potash solution to pH 7.0 I 0.4. The nibs are then dried to minimum water content and milled. If, on the other hand, cocoa bean mass for the production of chocolate is to be produced, the nibs are milled to maximum fineness.After that, the cocoa bean mass is pressed and thus separated into press cake and cocoa butter.Cocoa butter is a much sought after commodity and important to chocolate production. The cocoa press cake is used for the production of cocoa powder. In utilizing press cake produced in the countries of origin, certain difficulties are encountered. The quality in respect of flavour, fineness and bacteriological standard varies. Especially the bacterial content may be unsatisfactorily high. To be able to produce high quality cocoa powder and cocoa bean mass from the nonalkalized press cake, the press cake should for example satisfy the requirements of the following specification Fat content 8 23 , usually 8 128 Water content max. 6.0 Shell content max. 2.0 , based upon cocoa nibs Ash content max. 8.0 , based upon defatted powder Fineness 99 below 75 um Flavour free from foreign flavour and odour pH 5.5 0.3 Colour light brown Insect fragments max. 60 100 g Rat hair max. 2 100 gBacteriological standard Total count max. 200,000 g Yeasts max. 50 g Moulds max 50 g Coliform bacteria max. 10 g Escherichia coli if possible negative Salmonella negative 25 g One object of the present invention is to provide cocoa powder and cocoa bean mass having a far higher bacteriological standard than exemplified in the above specification. The total count of bacteria should be below 5,000 g. In addition, the international require menus regarding flavour and fineness must be satisfied. Another object of this invention is to provide a novel process for the production of high quality cocoa powder and cocoa bean mass of adjusted flavour and good bacteriological standard, by proceeding from press cake of varying quality. The process comprises adjusting the water content and also the fat content by adding a selected edible fat. In addition, and if desired, the aroma may be adjusted by the addition of flavouring agents, and the wettability may be adjusted by the addition of emulsifiers. The distinctive features of this invention reside in the sterilization of particulate cocoa and in the subsequent adjustment of the aroma and the fat content of the cocoa particles according to need. The charac teristic features of the invention will appear from the appended claims. The production process according to this invention proceeds from natural press cake of varying quality. The cocoa press cake. is crushed in a coarse crusher to particle form. These particles are then conducted through a magnet to remove any metal fragments. The cocoa particles are then fed into a mixer which is sup plied with a given amount of water and, if desired, with solutions of K2CO3, Na2CO3 or NH4 2CO3 to estab lish the required pH. Other additives, such as mono saccharides, common salt and organic acids permitted as ffio additives and affecting the colouring and flavour of the cocoa, may also be supplied according to need. The water content of the cocoa particles is ad justed to 5 20 by weight. To facilitate reduction of the bacterial content, the moist and possibly alkalized cocoa particles are conveyed to. a retarding container in which the residence time and also the temperature and the airthumidity can be varied. The temperature usually. Iies between 60 and 950a, and the residence time usually is between O.and I hour. The residence time and the temperature affect not only the bacterial content, but are also of importance to the colouring of the powder. When the treatment of the cocoa particles in the retarding container is finished, the particles are sup plied to a sterilizer operating at a temperature of 100 110 0C and at a pressure which is atmospheric or slightly higher. In a preferred embodiment, the steri lizer is a continuous autoclave in which the operating temperature is 103 20C and the transit time is 5 3 min. During passage through the sterilizer, the water content of cocoa particles is increased by means of steam to a level which maximally is 10 by weight higher than the input value. By this treatment, any pathogenetic bacteria are eliminated, and the total count of bacteria is reduced to below 5,000 g. The wet, hot cocoa particles are then dried to a water content. of from 2 to 5i. The drying operation should take place in a sterile atmosphere, for instance in a fluidized bed with sterile filtrated hot air. If necessary, the temperature may be somewhat increased at the end of the drying operation in order to enhance the cocoa flavour. These dry cocoa particles are now used for the production of cocoa powder or cocoa bean masses. For the production of cocoa powder, the dry, hot cocoa particles are then cooled to a temperature be low 28CCoo1ing should be carried out in a dry and sterile atmosphere, for instance in a fluidized bed with cold, dehumidified and sterile filtrated air. The cocoa particles are then conveyed to silos. The cocoa particles now have a water content of from 2 to 5 by weight, and their pH and ash content correspond to quality requirements. Furthermore, colour and flavour have been established. However, due to agglomeration, the fineness requirements are not satisfied. From the silos, the cocoa particles are portioned into a mixer in whichwater, fat, flavouring agents such as vanillin and emulsifiers, all having a given low bacterial count, can be dosed according to need. The fat must be an edible fat, such as cocoa butter of varying degrees of deodorization, or some other vegetable oil. For increased wettability, emsulsifiers, such as lecithin, monoglycerides etc., can be dosed and admixed. After admixture of all ingredients, the treated cocoa particles are conveyed to a pulverizer to impart to the particles an acceptable fineness 99 below 75 sum . The finished powder is tempered in conventional manner to prevent lump formation, before it is packed in bags. By this process, an acceptable cocoa powder of several different qualities can be produced. Some exam ples of cocoa powder qualities that can be produced by the process of the invention, are the following 1. Cocoa powder having a fat content of from 10 to 12 , natural 2. Cocoa powder having a fat content of from 10 to 12 , alkaline several different qualities with different pH values, colours and aromas 3 Cocoa powde r having a fat content of from 10 to 12 , alkaline and with emulsifiers added 4. Cocoa powder having a fat content of from 20 to 22 alkaline and with aroma added. For the production of cocoa bean mass, the steri lived and dried cocoa particles are placed in a mixer.The particles are hot after the drying operation and may be used directly, without cooling. An edible fat, preferably cocoa butter having a given degree of deodorization and or in some cases some other vegetable fat is.dosed into the mixer. The fatcontent is adjusted to from 45 to 60 , and the temperature is raised to from 40 to 950C, preferably about 700C. By this treatment, the agglomerates are dissolved, and a smooth cocoa bean mass is obtained. The mixer should be provided with a cover and vacuum facilities to prevent admixture of air. After treatment for a suitable period of time, usually about 15 min., a fineness of about 100 um is imparted to the mass, for instance by conducting it through a ball mill and a vibrating screen.In order further to reduce the water content of the mass, it is preferably conducted through a thin film evaporator before it is tempered and blocked in conventional manner. By producing cocoa bean mass in the manner described above, it is possible to obtain a cocoa bean mass which essentially corresponds to the cocoa bean mass one obtains by proceeding from cocoa beans, provided that non deodorized cocoa butter is used. However, the mass produced according to the invention will have a far lower bacterial content than conventional cocoa bean mass. The flavour can be varied by using as raw material in the production of the cocoa particles according to the invention a press cake from different bean types. Cocoa particles of different origin may then be admixed, and furthermore deodorized cocoa butter may be employed. It is also possible to produce novel types of bean masses containing, instead of all or part of the cocoa butter, substitute fats for cocoa butter such as coberin . The fat portion may also consist of hydrogenated and fractionated vegetable oils, for instance for the production of icings or ice cream dip masses. In addition, it is.possible to supply other additives, such as emulsifiers or flavouring agents, provided that they have a given, low bacterial count. Examples of cocoa bean mass and novel types of cocoa bean masses that can be produced by the present invention, are the following 1. Reconstructed cocoa bean mass consisting of 51.5 by weight of the above described, steri lized cocoa particles and 48.5 by weight of non deodorized cocoa butter or partially deodo rized . 2. Basic mass for icing masses, consisting of 51.5 by weight of the above described, sterilized cocoa particles and 48.5 by weight of frac tionated palm kernel fat. 3. Basic mass for the production of ice cream dip masses, consisting of 51.58 by weight of the above described, sterilized cocoa particles and 48.5 by weight of coconut soybean oil. In alL of the above cases there are obtained, in contrast to coventional cocoa bean masses, masses with very low bacterial counts.EXAMPLE 1 l 500 kg of cocoa press cake having a water content of 3 , a fat content of 11 and a total count of bacteria of 50,000 per gram were crushed in a coarse crusher to a maximum size of 1 mm. The cocoa particles were then conveyed via a.magnetic separator to a silo. From the silo, the particles were conveyed to a mixer into which potash dissolved in water was dosed to a water content of 10 by weight of the particles and a pH of 7.1. The residence time in the mixer was about 30 min.at a temperature of 800C. The mixer was.emptied by means of a screw conveyer into a continuous autoclave StorkContinuous Process, Stork, Amsterdam, operating pressure 1.01 1.4 bar . In the autoclave, the temperature of the particles 0 was raised to 103 C, and the transit time was 3.5 min. The water content of the particles had now been raised to 15 by weight, which was done by supplying steam. The wet particles were then conveyed to a fluidized bed where they were dried with the hot, sterile filtrated air temperature 800 . The water content was reduced to 5 by weight, whereupon the cocoa particles were cooled in a continuous vibrating cooler by means. of chilled, dried and sterile filtrated air to 250cm The cocoa particles now had a water content of 4.58 by weight. From the vibrating cooler, the cocoa particles were conveyed to a silo and thence to a mixer where the fat content was adjusted to 208 by weight by adding 56 kg of non deodorized cocoa butter . If necessary, it is also possible at this stage to add water, flavouring agents and emulsifiers for increased instantness. All such additives should have a given, low bacterial count. Lastly, the cocoa particles were pulverized to a fineness of 99 below 75 um, and finally the powder was tempered and packed in bags in conventional manner. In this manner, a cocoa powder of satisfactory flavour and colour had been obtained. Furthermore, the powder had the following accepted analysis values Fat content 20.28 Water content 4.5 by weight Fineness 99 below 75um Bacterial count Total plate count 3,500 g Also the cocoa powder types mentioned under items 1 4 on page 5 were produced by this technique.EXAMPLE 2 For the production of reconstructed cocoa bean mass, the same raw material as in Example 1 was used, although the cocoa particles had not been treated with K2C031 but were sterilized and dried as in Example 1.In this case, the particles were dried to a water content of 3 by weight. The dry and still hot particles were weighed 267.5 kg in a special mixer with heating and vacuum facilities. With the simultaneous addition of portions of 232.5 kg of non deodorized cocoa butter, the mass was worked under the action of heat to about 700C. To prevent the admixture of air, a weak vacuum was established in the mixer. After a working time of about 15 min., the particles had been distributed in the cocoa butter. The mass was then conveyed through a ball mill and vibrating screen to ensure a particle size of maximally 100 us. The mass was then tempered and blocked in conventional manner. To further decrease the water content of the mass in this instance, the mass was conveyed through a thin 0 film evaporator at 70 C under vacuum. The produced cocoa bean mass had the following accepted analysis values Fat content 53.0 by weight Water content 0.9 by weight Fineness 99 below 100 m Bacterial count Total plate count 2,000 g In this manner, also the bean masses mentioned under items 1 3 on page 6 were produced.
