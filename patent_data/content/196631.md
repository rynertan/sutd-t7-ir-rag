# INTEGRABLE HIGH FREQUENCY, WIDE BAND AND SUPERLINEAR AMPLIFIER AND ITS FABRICATION

## Abstract
An integrable, high frequency superlinear amplifier and its fabrication method. Which belongs to the basic amplifier fabrication field related to the negative feedback and signal conversion. The adoption of such methods as compromising and the separation of integration may solve the problems in technol ogy like the complication in KÎ² design, the large quantity of elements, and the difficulties in integration, generalization, the serialised and universal design and fabrication. The amplifiers have following advantages high frequen cy, wide band, superlinera, high stability, integration, high reliability, low noise, antigravitation, serialised and universal fabrication, and adjustable impedance without a trans former. It may be used digital pulse amplification and transfor mation near 10GHZ, in meters, automation, video and audio frequencies, telecommunication systems, fiber optic sys tems, active analogue computation, and in other cases which call for high requirements such as military and aerospace uses.
