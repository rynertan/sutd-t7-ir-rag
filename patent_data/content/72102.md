# Method of making, and plant for producing, combustible gas.

## Abstract
A combustible gas producer plant is described in which a finely divided inert particulate material fluidised bed is divided into a first, combustible gas producing section and a second, heating section, to both of which sections fuel is fed. Heat transfer, by bed material migration, from the second to the first section sustains the reaction in the first section leading to the production of combustible gas. A diaphragm water wall divides and surrounds the volumes above bed sections and is part of a boiler generating steam used optionally with added oxygen to fluidise the first bed section. The steam is also used to flu idise the bed material at the boundary of the bed sections and prevent in bed gas migration across that boundary. The sec ond section of the bed is fluidised with air or an air inert gas mixture. Fluidisation is effected with sparge tubes and the plant may include evaporator, superheater and economiser sections for the boiler.
