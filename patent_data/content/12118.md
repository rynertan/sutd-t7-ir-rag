## Description
ImDrovements in diaphragm valves of water valves, particularlv for washing machinesThis invention is related to improvements in diaphragm valves of the water valves employed particularly in washing machines, such as dish washing machines or linenwashing machines for home use.Water valves of said kind are known in the prior art, wherein the water way is controlled by. a diaphragm valve operating in such a way that its closing and its opening is caused by the pressure of the supply line feeding the washing machine in cooperation with a movable member moved by the movable core of a solenoid valve.Such a diaphragm valve includes a resilient diaphragm being peripherally flexible and centrally stiffened by a plate.The diaphragm is fixed in a way that, from a part, it acts with the rigid portion on a valve seat opened towards the outlet, while, from the other part, defines a pressure chamber communicating through a first hole with the water ri Z under pressure and through a second hole with the outlet.The operation of the valve takes place by actuating the movable member moved by the solenoid valve core, that is when the solenoid is de energized, the closing member with the movable core is pushed by a light spring to close the communication duct between the pressure chamber and the valve outlet, so that inside said pressure chamber, water enters increasing the pressure on the diaphragm and holding the latter in a closing position against the valve seat.On the contrary, when the solenoid is energized, the core is attracted together with the closing member, enabling the duct communicating with the outlet to pass water from the pressure chamber to the outlet, causing a pressure drop an said chamber, so as the diaphragm will be raised from the same pressure of the coming water.The valves of said kind are generally operable for pressures above a certain value, but they are particularly defective for light pressures, as they are unable to guarantee a stable closing and opening.Said disadvantages are caused above all by the limited peripheral flexibility of the diaphragm, which offers in this way a certain resistance to the light pressure of the water and to adherence phenomena between the same diaphragm and the plate preventing the diaphragm zone facing the plate from participating to flexion movements of the same diaphragm. Another disadvantage is that such is the diaphragm flexion during the opening phase tah said diaphragm can adhere to the upper wall of thn pressure chamber showing a certain inertia during the closing phase, said inertia increasing, of course, in case of water supplied by light pressure.This invention eliminates said disadvantages and alloy the diaphragm to safely operate also in case of light pressure of the supply waterTo this end the improved diaphragm valve of the present invention is .characterised in that the plate coupled with the central zone of the diaphragm is provided with a peripheral undercutting which, in the coupling with said diaphragm central zone, forms an annular channel communicating with the pressure chamber through the gaps formed with the movement of the flexible peripheral wall of the diaphragm spacing takes being provided to maintain open said peripheral channel said peripheral channel communicating in turn with an annular channel praticated on the face of the diaphragm portion contacting said plate.In addition, on the plate face facing the pressure chamber are provided raised walls, preferably disposed along a circumference and designed to maintain said plate spaced from the upper wall of the pressure chamber.The foregoing and other additional features will become apparent from the the following specification of the not limitative example of embodiment as shown in the accompanying drawing, wherein figure 1 is a middle cross section of a water valve including the improved diaphragm according to the present invention figure 2 is an enlarged view of said diaphragm.As shown in figure 1, a water valve for the control of the water passage in a washing machi includes a body 1 that, according to the recentest art, is a plastic material, but it could also be metallic, such as brass.The body 1 has an inlet 2 provided with a connection thread 3, said inlet being directed toward the suDDly line feeding the water.Said inlet 2 is preferably intercepted by a wire gauze filter 4 being able to hold even the smallest solid impurities dragged by the water.From the opposite part, the valve has an outlet 5, while inside the valve is provided an annular valve seat 6 that, inclosing position, prevents the water from passing from the inlet 2 toward the outlet 5.Above the body 1 is provided a casing 7 enclosing a solenoid including a coil 8 wound on an. inner spool 9 provided with an axial hole filled with a cylindrical housing 10, preferably in plastic material, closed, on the upper part, by an integral cap F1 and enlarging inside the body 1 t3 form a UDDer wall 12 of a pressure chamber, said wall 12 being bent in 13 so as to constitte a resting edge for a peripheral ring 14 of a diaphragm 15, anchoring the peripheral ring of the diaphragm in a seat 16 and sealing it, so that between the diaphragm 15 and the upper wall 12 is formed said pressure chamber, the latter being explained later.Said chamber communicates with the interior of the cylindrical housing 10, into whiclz7 slides the movable core 17 of the solenoid. Said movable core is pushed toward the bottom by by a recall spring 18, interposed between the core ana the integral cap 11 of the housing 10, said movable core being provided toward the pressure chamber with a closing member 19.The whole is conceived in a way that, when the solenoid is de energized, the core 17 is subject to the thrust of the spring 18 and therefore the closing member 19 is rested on the mouthpiece of a conduit 20 traversing the diaphragm, occluding said mouthpiece and enabling the water coming from the inlet 2 to fill the pressure cham ber toward a conduit 21, the latter traversing the diaphragm and being disposed toward the pressure water arrival.In this way, in the pressure chamber is established the pressure of the supply line pushing the diaphragm to close against the seat 6, interrupting the water passage. When, on the contrary, tllé solenoid is energized, the core 17 is attracted toward the interior against the thrust of the spring 11.Consequently the conduit 20 is opened, communicating in this way the pressure chamber with the outlet. Consecuently the pressure in the pressure chamber drops and the pressure of the entering water raises the diaphragm, opening therefore the valve and enabling the water passage toward the outlet 5.All the foregoing referred to figure 1 have to be considered as a known art.Still according to the kuno.n art, as shDxlr by figures nd 2, the diaphragm 15 is in a resilient yieldable material, such as rubber or another suitable material, and is shaped so as to present, besides the peripheral ring 14, a circular middle zone 22 between the ring 14 and the zone 22 being interposed a thin wall 23 forming an annular wave being the proper diaphragm flexible element.The wall 23 extends internally with a right section 24 connecting about perpendicularly with the central zone 22.Always according to the known art, the diaphragm 15, in the central position 22, is coupled with a Plate 25 of stiff material, or example stiff Dlastic material, the diameter of which is substantiall equal than the diameter of the central portion 22 of the diaphragm. Said plate has centrally a projection 26, doinwardly directed, shaped in a way to form with the plate lower face an annular groove 27 into which is fitted the edge 28 of a hole obtained in the portion 22 to allow the passage and the fixing of the projection 26.Said projection 26 is extended by guide legs 29 which are disposed inside the seat 6 of the valve.From a stall counteropposed projection 30 is provides the hole 20 which communicates the pressure chamber with the outlet and which traverses axially the projection 26, said hole being able to increase in diameter, as at 20, inside said projection.Sideways the plate 25 is extended downxrardly with a cylindrical spout 31, the latter being provided with the through hole 21, which communicates the water inlet with the valve pressure chamber.According to this invention, the plate 25 has on its lower face a peripheral undercutting 32 which, by COUD ling with the central zone 22 of the diaphragm, forms an annular channel which can comnunicate with the exterior through gaps generating because of the flexibility of the right section 24 of the wall 23. The channel is maintained in constant cross section by means of staves 33, distributed along the peripheral portion of the same plate 25, said stakes constituting spacers preventing the resilient Portion 22 from closing the channel. Correspondingly, on the face of the portion 22 facing the plate, is obtained an annular channel 34, which is kept in continuous communication with the channel 32, so that the channels 32 and 34 constitute elements enabling the infiltration of water film between the facing surfaces of the plate and the diaphragm portion 22, thereby eliminating adherence phenomena and rendering more flexible the diaphragm,as said channels alloYs the same portion 22 to participate to the resilient deformation of the diaphragm, notwthstanding the greater thickness of the latter.Always in accordance with this invention, on the upper face of the plate 25, walls 35 are raised, preferably distributed along a circumference and suitably spaced therebetween, which walls have to end to keep the diaphragm spaced from the upper wall 12 of the pressure chamber, in order to avoid adherence phenomena to this wall, still permitting the water passage.This arrangement allows a quick correspondance of the valve to closing, because eliminates any resistancç to the Flooding of the pressure chamber by pressure water.It can be noted from the foregoing that the diaphragm flexibility is higly increased and adherence phenomena are eli.ninated which could oppose to the movement of the same diaphragm This allows the diaphragm to be controlled even by.water flowing with a very low pressure, and to be firmly arranged in the opening and closing position, which positions are not critical even with light pressures of the supply water.Of course this invention is not limited to the above illustrated embodiment and various modifications and rearrangements as will occur to those skllled in the art upon full comprehension of this invention may be resorted to without de arting from the scope of this invention.
