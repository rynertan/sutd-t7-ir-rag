# Process for the preparation of hydrocarbon solutions of organic magnesium compounds containing oxygen and the solutions obtained.

## Abstract
Process for the preparation of a solution of a magnesium compound wherein a magnesium compound with organic groups which each contain 3 30 carbon atoms and in total contain at least 7 carbon atoms and which are each attached to the magnesium atom by an oxygen atom is dissolved in a hydrocarbon solvent in the presence of at least 5 moles , calculated to the magnesium compound, of an organic compound of transition metal of Groups IV to VI of the Periodic Table of Elements in which the organic groups are attached to the Transition metal atoms by an oxygen atom. These solutions have the advantage that they have a lower viscosity than the original magnesium compounds so that they can be handled easier.
