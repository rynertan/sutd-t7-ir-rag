# Compliant press fit electrical contact.

## Abstract
A compliant, press fit, electrical contact 10 includes a relief groove 34, 36 which forms an area of reduced cross sectional thickness to provide a stress concentration, and thus a controlled region of plastic flow 80, 82 , to create a plastic elastic hinge 78, 79 . When the contact 10 is insert ed into a plated through hole in a printed circuit board, the hinge 78, 79 elastically deforms until a predetermined push in force is reached, at which time a controlled plastic flow begins. Once the point of plastic flow is reached, the amount of additional push in force required for additional deflection of the hinge 78, 79 is greatly reduced, so that smaller hole sizes may be accommodated with a relatively small additional push in force. However, the required mini mum pull out force is maintained for the entire range of hole sizes, since elastic energy remains stored in the hinge 78, 79 , even after plastic flow begins. The contact 10 is manu factured through a series of simple coining and punching operations, so that complex rounding and rolling operations are avoided.
