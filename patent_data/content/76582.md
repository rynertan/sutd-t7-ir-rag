# New polyester compositions shaped articles obtained from them and processes for preparing them.

## Abstract
A new linear polyester contains in its chain the residues of a hydroxy bis hydroxy alkoxy xanth 9 one e.g. polyethylene terephthalate containing such residues which act as a UV stabiliser. Processes for the preparation of the polymers include the reaction of a dibasic acid, glycol and 1,3,6 trihydroxyxanthone whereby only two of the xanthone hydroxyl groups take part in the polyester forming reaction.
