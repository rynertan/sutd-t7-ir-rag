# Wheel slip control system.

## Abstract
A wheel slip control system used for a vehicle compris ing a a pressure source selection means 32 being in formed of a first pressure of a first pressure source 11, 12 and a second pressure of a second pressure source 24 to measure the difference of said two pressures, and adapted to select one of said first and second pressure source de pending on the measured differential pressure b a slip control means 23 receiving a first adjustment signal for anti skid control to adjust the first presure provided by said pressure source selection means 32 or receiving a second adjustment signal for traction control to adjust the second pressure provided by said pressure source selection means 32 and after adjustment operating to suppress slipping of wheels including driven wheels 16, 17 c a brake slip detection means 25, 26, 30 detecting the state of slipping of wheels 14, 15, 16, 17 during a braking operation of the vehicle and producing a brake slip signal representing the state of slipping d an acceleration slip detection means 25, 26, 30 detecting the state of slipping of wheels 14, 15, 16, 17 during an accelerating operation of the vehicle e a second throttle valve 7 being placed at an intake air path 3 provided with a first throttle valve 5 interlocked to an acceleration increase means 4 and f an electronic control means 30 receiving said brake slip signal and providing the first adjustment signal based on said received signal for said slip control means 23 so that the driven wheel speed is within a first predetermined range, receiving said acceleration slip signal and providing the second adjustment signal based on said received signal for said slip control means 23 so that the driven wheel speed is within a second predetermined range, and provid ing said third adjustment signal to a driving means for driving said second throttle valve 7 based on said received signal for said slip control means 23 so that the driven wheel speed is within a third predetermined range.
