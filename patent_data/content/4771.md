## Description
Nursing bottle holderTECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to a nursing bottle holder for location around, to be supported by, the neck of a person feeding a baby.BACKGROUND ART When feeding a baby fron a bottle, it is colon practice for a person to cradle the baby in one arm and to hold the bottle to the baby s mouth with the other hand. Such a procedure requires the use of both arms, thus restricting the person fron performing any other activities during feedin. Further, it is necessary to l,ut the bottle down before, for example, winding qf the baby can take lace, free standing bottles being very prone to accidental spillage and to contamination of the teat. It has been proposed to overcome the above problems by providing bottle holders each including holding means for receiving a bottle, said means being suspended from or otherwise carried on a halter member supported around the neck of a user. Although such known arrangements succeed in freeing one of the user s hands, known bottle holders of this type suffer fro a number of disadvantages. Not the le st of these are that the holders themselves are cu bers me in construction, operation and appearance, movement of the bottle holding means and therefore the bottle relative to the halter member often being very restricted. Further, known holders often comprise a fabric, for example elasticated, halter member the material of which cm readily entrap therein foreign matter and provide an excellent breeding ground for bacteria and the like, while they may alt rnatively or additionally include a plurality of metal components which are very difficult to clean and are toxic. DISCL SURE OF THE VE TION The object of the present invention is to provide G baby bottle holder in which the manoeuvrability of the bottle holding means relative to the halter member is greatly improved and which is such as to enable a bottle to be held, when desired, in an inoperative retracted position out of the way of the baby to facilitate winding of the baby and the li e. According to the present invention there is provided G nursing bottle holder comprising a halter member to be supported around the neck of a person feeding a baby, and nursing bottle support means including a holder member to receive therein a nursing bottle, said support means being mounted on one end of the halter member, the holder being characterised in that the halter member is of substantially U shape and includes a one end extent terminating, in use, at or adjacent the chest of said person, and u ort means are mounted to permit substantially free pivoting movement of the holder member rel tive to the halter me er about the central longitudinal axis of the one end extent of the halter member and to permit da p ened pivoting movement, against a frictional resistance, of said holder member relative to the halter member about an axis extending perpendicular to said central longitudinal axis of the one end extent of the halter member. Such a device has the major advantages of substantially universal manoeuvrability of t4e holder member on the halter member, which manoeuvrability is such as to enable a bottle in the holder member to track lightly the baby s mouth head movements and also to enable the bottle and holder member to be pivoted against a frictional resistance to and one of a number of unobtrusive retracted positions in which it is held until required. Further, the holder can be made of a plastics material to a relatively simple construction, providing a very hygienic article which can readily be washed or wiped clean,while it is preferred that holders according to the invention have an inherent adjustability which ensures positive, comfortable location of the halter member on tie user, which enables alteration of the relative positions of the halter member and the holder member to suit a part icular user, and which enables the holder member to grip therein any one of a wide range of shapes and sizes of bottles. More particularly, the halter member may comprise a length of pliable material, such as copper coated mild steel rod encased in a plastics sheath, which can readily be deforre into a shape suitable to a user, the material retaining its deformed shape thereby enabling the position of the holder member relative to the neck of the person feeding the baby to be altered. Alternatively the halter member may include means for adjusting the length of the one end extent thereof to permit said alterat on of the position of the holder member relative to the neck of a person using the bottle holder. The support means conveniently includes pivot member in which is received the one end of the halter member whereby said pivot member is substantially freely rotatable through 360 on said one end of the halter member about the central longitudinal axis of the one end extent of said halter member. The holder member of the support means preferably comprises a flexible strap, conveniently of a plastics material such as polythene, including a first end extent mounted on the pivot member to be pivotal relative to said pivot member, against a frictional resistance, about an axis extending perpendicular to the central longitudinal axis of the one end extent of the halter member, the strop further including an intermediate extent in the form of a loop for embracing a bottle end a further end extent received on, to lie parallel with, the first end extent. The first end extent of the strap may be of bifurcated form, the arms of said extent being located ore to each side of the pivot member, the support means further including a bush having a head portion and an internally threaded shank portion nd a co operating screw having a head portion and an externally threaded shank portion, the shanks of the bush and screw extending through aligned bores in said pivot member and two arms, the central lonitudinal axis of the bush screw combination comprising the axis about which the dampened pivoting movement can teke place.The frictional resistance between the abutting feces of the bifurcated one end extent of the strap and the pivot member can be adjusted by appropriate rotation of the screw and threaded bush tc alter the pressure therebetween. The further end extent of the strap may have formed therein a longitudinal slot through which the shank of the bush or screw passes whereby, on drawing of the shank portion of the screw into the shank portion of the bush to brin the undersurfaces of the head portions of the bush and screw into pressurised contact with the strap to effect the frictional resistance between the abutting faces of the one end extent of the strap arid the pivot member, said further end extent of the strap is retained in a given position relative to the first end extent of the strap between the undersurface of the head portion of the bush or screw and a surface of one arm of the first end extent of the strap. Each side face of the slot conveniently has formed therein a plurality of longitudinally spaced notches in any pair of blch can be received pair of co operating, diametrically opposed projections formed on the undersurface of the head portion of the screw or bush whereby, on tightening of the bush screw combination, the further end extent of the strap can be positively located in any one of a plurality of different positions relative to the first ed extent of the strap to alter te diameter cf the intermed iate extent of the strap and thereby accommodate bottles of various sizes.BRIEF DESCRIFTION OF THE TRAVINGS Fig. 1 is a side view of a bottle holder according to the invention in an operative feeding position Fi. 2 shows the bottle holder of Fig. 1 in an inoperative retracted portion Fig. 3 shows, in exploded form,a pivot member, a screw and a bush of support means of a holder according to the invention, the screw and bush being shown in both si e and plan elevations, together with a halter member to a smaller scale Fig. 4 is a plan view of a holder menber of a holder according to the invention, showing the bush and screw ofFig. 3 Fib. 5 is a view in the direction of arrow V of Fig. 4 with pert of the further end extent of the flexible strat cut away Fig. 6 is part longitudinal section through the assembled support means and holder member of a holder according to the invention, and Fig. 7 illustrates an alternative halter member of a according to the invention and including means for adjusting the 1 length of the one end extent thereof, said means being shown in plan, side and end elevations. BEST MODE OF C R YING THE INVENTION Referring in particular to Figs. 3 to 6 of the drawings, the bottle holder comprises a halter member indicated generally at 2 of substantially U shape to seat round the neck of a person using the holder, the halter member including a central core 4 of copper coated mild steel rod encased in an outer plastics sheath 6. Gne end 7 of the halter member 2 is shaped to be received within, to be substantially freely rotatable relative to, a pivot housing indicates generally at 8 and as will be detailed below, while the other end of the halter member terminates in a smooth faced end cap 10. The pivot housing 8 comprises a pair of opposed, plastics side plates 12,14 which are a snap fit together to form the housing 8, the plates 12,14 being internally recessed at 15 to receive the one end 7 of the halter member 2 whereby said housing can, as mentioned above, be rotated substantially freely through 3600 on the one end 7 of the halter member 2 about the central longitudinal axis of the one end extent of said member 2. The side plates 12,14 each have formed therethrough aligned apertures which, on completion of the housing 8, define a bore 16 through said housing extending perpe dicul arly to the central longitudinal axis of the one end extent of the halter member 2. The bottle holder further comprises a holder member in the form of a flexible moulded strap of a plastics material indluding a bifur sted first end extent 17 having a pair of parallel arms 18,20 spaced apart to receive therebetween the pivot housing 8, said arms being aperatured at 22,24 respectively to provide, on location of the housing 8 between the arms 18,20, continuations of the bore 16 through said housing. The strap further includes an intermediate extent in the form of a loop 25 to receive therein a nursing bottle, and g further end extent 26 which lies substantially parallel with t e arms 18,20 of the first end extent 17, said extent 26 being narrower than the extent 17 and passing through a bridge 28, integrally formed on the outer face of the arm 20, to lie along said outer face. The further end extent 26 of the strap has a central, longitudinal slot 30 formed therein, the side faces of said slot each being castellated to provide a series of longit udinally spaced notches 32 for reasons to b detailed below. The pivot housing 8 and holder member are interconn ected by means ol a screw indicated generally at 34 and a co operating, internally threaded bush indicated generally at 36. e external diameter of hollow stem portion 38 of the bush 36 corresponds substantially with that of the bore 16,22, said bush further including an increased diameter head portion 40 having a flat, annular undersurface 42 and an indented outer surface to facilitate rotation of the bush. The screw 54 includes a threaded stem portion 44 and an incressed diameter he d portion 46 the undersurface 47 of which has formed thereon a pair of diametricallyopposed spigots 48 and a pair of straight edged depending portions 50 defining a channel across the surface 48 of a width corresponding with that of the further end extent 26 of the strap. To assemble the holder, the stem portion 33 of the bush 36 is inserted through the aperture 22 in the arm 13 of tho strap and into the bore 16 in the pivot housing 8, while the stem portion 44 of the screw is inserted through te slot 30 in the further end extent 26 of the strap, through the aperture 24 in the arm 20 of the bifurcated one end extent 17 of the strap and into the bore 16 in te pivot housing. The undersurface of the head portion 46 of the screw is located to embrace the extent 26 of the strap with the spigots 49o received within opposed ones of a pair of the notches in said extent 25 of the strap and the depending porticos 50 abutting the outer face of the arm 20 of the strap. The aperture 24 in the arm 20 is also provided with a pair of diametrically opposed notches 51 ali ied with the notches 32 in the further end extent 26 of the strap, said aperture 24 otherwise being of generally elliptical shape to receive therein a correspondingly shaped annular boss not shown surrounding the stem portion 44 and extending axially of tha stem portion beyond the spigots 43. Such an. arrangement facilitates initial location of the screw 34 in that it c n only be inserted through the slot 30 and bore 24 with its spigots 48 aligned with, to be received in, notches ,2.Further, any tendency for the screw to be rotated once received within the support moans is resisted not only bg the co operating spigots 48 and notches 32 but by the Co operating annular boss not shown and aperture 24. Once the bush and screw are so positioned, the bush is rotated to draw the bush and screw together and to urge the undersurface of said components into pressurised contact with the outer surfaces of the arms 18,20 respect ively of the first end extent 17 of the strap. Consequent ly the pivot housing 8 is compressed between said arms by an amount dependent upon the torcue applied to the bush and screw. Thus the mating faces of the arms 18,20 and the pivot housing 8 provide a friction clutch arrangement between the strap and the housing which enables dampened rotation of the strap, bush and screw relative to the pivot housing 8 about an axis extending through the bore 16, and against the frictional resistance existing between said mating faces. The bottle holder member can thus be located, and will remain in, any chosen position relative to the halter member 2 within the available arc of rotation about the axis through the bore 16. In use of the holder, z nursing bottle is located within the looped intermediate extent 25 of the strap and the further end extent 26 of the strap is positioned on the one end extent 17 of the strap such that, on tightenin of the screw 34 bush 36 combination, the spigots 48 on the screw are received within notches 32 in the slot 30 of said further end extent 26 whereby the bottle is securely gripped by the strap. The adjustability of the strap provided by the notches 32 enables te holder to receive therein any one of a wide range of bottle shapes and sizes.The internal surface of the loop 25 of the strap is provided with a series of laterally spaced ridges extending longitudinally of the strap thereby permitting manual rotation of the bottle within the loop if desired. The gripping of the bottle by the loop 25 is also such as to permit longitudinal manual movement of the bottle within said loop if desired to adjust the position of the bottle teat relative to the strap and provide more comfortable feeding for the baby. The halter member 2 is then located around a user s neck, the shape of the halter, as ell as the location of the holder member and the angular position of the bottle relative to the pivot housing 8, being suitably chosen to enable comfortable feeding of a baby held by the user. A typical feeding position of a bottle holder is shown inFig. 1 in which it can be seen that a baby is cradled in a mother s arm with a bottle ideally located for com fortable feeding, the other arm of the mother being free. During feeding, the relatively free rotation of the bottle, holder member and pivot housing as a whole about the one end of the halter member allows the bottle to track lightly the baby s mouth head movements. When it is desired, for example, to wind the baby, the bottle and holder member can be pivoted against the frictional resistance about te axis through the bore 16 to a retracted osition ot of the way of the baby, the bottle remaining in said position until it is desired to resume feeding, the frictional resistance being sufficient to counter the weight of the bottle and its contents. Such an inoperative. retracted position of a bottle holler is shown in Fig. 2, the bottle still being firmly held but out of the 1ay of the baby to enable the mother to wind or otherwise attend to the baby with both hands.. The 3600 rotation of the holder member relative to the halter member enables right or left handed use of the holder, the construction and operation of the holder being such as to enable substantially universal adjustment of the position of a bottle within the holder whilst at the same time leavin free one arm of the user during feedin. Further, S bottle is securely held in the holder even during winding thereby eliminating the possibility of spilling as often occurs under normal circumstances. Referring to Fig. 7, there is shorn an arrangement which enables the main extent of the halter member 2 to be preformed in, for example, solid plastics, into a rigid given shape whilst still enabling adjustment of the Sosi tion of the attached holder member relative thereto. More particularly, the halter member terminates in a hollow end section 52 the bore 54 of which has a longitudinal flat thereon.One end of a correspondingly shaped rod 56 isreceived within said bore, a flat 58 on said rod co operating with the flat in the bore 54 to prevent rotation of the rod relative to the end secticn of the halter member. The other end 60 of the rod 54 is shaped to be rotatably received within the pivot housing 8 in the manner of the embodiment of Fi. 3. Integrally formed with the rod 56 is a parallel, upstanding arm member or selector clip 62 having an inwardly facing projection 64 formed on the free ed thereof, the undersurface of said projection 64 being undercut as shown at 66. The external surface of the end section 52 of the halter member has a plurality of axially spaced notches 68 formed therein1 tee operative surfaces 70 of said notches being angled inwardly and downwardly. Thus it will be appreciated that the rod 56 can be located in any one of a number of different axial locations relative to the hallo end section 52 of the halter member thereby providing for adjustment of the elevation of the holder member end bottle relative to the neck of a user. The co operation between the angled surfaces on the projection 64 and the notches 68 reduces the possibility of accidental removal of the selector slip from t e halter member, particularly when in use with a laden bottle held in the holder. Other ways of achieving this adjustment will be apparent to those skilled in the art. As well as the advantages apparent from the above description, in particular the inherent manoeuvrability of the bottle and support means on the halter member and the adjustability in the position of the bottle relative to a user, bottle holders according to the invention can also incorporate a number of additional advantages over known arrangements. The preferred holder is moulded from quality plastics material providing a non toxic, very hygienic, easily wiped clean device which is very easy to manufacture, simple to operate and light and attractive to wear. The constructional simplicity is such as to enable the device to be easily and quickly disassembled or stripped down for cleaning purposes, while reassembly is also a very straightforward natter that even the nost non technical of persons can undertake. The design of the halter member is such as to achieve positive neck engagement with a minimum of interference with heir style or fashion clothing. The friction loading provided by the relative positions of the screw 34 and bush 36 can be adjusted to personal choice, rotation of the bush being facilitated, as has been mentioned above, by indenting the head portion thereof to provide good finger grip.
