# REGENERATION OF SPENT HYDROTREATING CATALYSTS

## Abstract
The present invention is related to a method to regener ate spent catalysts of hydrotreating processes for heavy hyd rocarbon oils when the catalystic activity is reduced as a result of accumulation of such heavy metals as vanadium and nic kel, characteristic of selective extraction and elimination of the sad vanadium by immersing the catalysts in alcohol at the temperature range of 0 200 C for 5 1,000 hours after removing coke accumulated thereon by burning at the temp erature of 400 600 C in an atmosphere of molecular oxygen containing gas.
