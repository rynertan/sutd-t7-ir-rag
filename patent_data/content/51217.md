## Description
OXIDATION PROCESS This invention relates to a new and useful process for the preparation of certain phthalimidines and more particularly with the preparation of 3 aryl 3 hydroxy phthalimidines which are useful as therapeutic agents. The 3 aryl 3 hydroxyphthalimidines produced in accordance with the present invention are compounds of the formula EMI1.1 wherein, Y and Z are each H, alkyl, halo, alkoxy, trifluoromethyl, hydroxy, alkanoyloxy, or alkanoylamino . X is P , Cl, Br, or NR1R2 in which R1 and R2 are each hydrogen, alkyl, alkynyl, glketyl, chcloalkyl, aryl or aralkyl and, R R is H, alkyl, cy.cloalkyl, or aralkyl. Some of the said compounds are known and are characterized by valuable therapeutic activity. For example, chlorthalidone, 3 hydroxy 3 3 sulfamyl 4 chlorophenyl phthalimidine, is widely used as an anti hypertensive and diuretic, and for treatment of renal or cardiovascular disorders. A substantial number of the said compounds are also useful as therapeutic agents for the same purposes.Others of the said compounds are useful as intermediates, e.g.for production of the therapeutically active compounds. The compounds of formula I are prepared in accordance, with the present process by oxidation of the corresponding desoxy compounds represented by the formula EMI2.1 wherein, X, Y, Z and R are each as.previously described. The total number of carbon atoms in each hydrocarbyl substituent described in Formulae I and II can range up to about 10, and these substituents can be branched or straightchained. The preferred compounds are those in which the hydrocarbyl radicals contain up to about 7 carbon atoms when aliphatic and up to about 10 carbon atoms when aromatic, e.g., phenyl, tolyl and naphthyl. The particularly preferred compounds of Formula I are those prepared from compounds of the formula EMI3.1 wherein, R, N and Z are as hereinbefore described Y1 is halo or CF3 and X1 i is halo, especially chloro, or NR1R2 wherein each of R1 and R2 is hydrogen, alkyl, alkynyl, alkenyl, cycloalky, aryl or aralkyl. The process of the present invention involves the conversion of deoxy compounds of Formula II, and Formula ISI, to corresponding compounds of Formula I by oxygenation at the 3 position of the phthalimide ring. Such oxidation can be accomplished by the usual methods employed in benzylic oxidation, e.g., elv. Chem. Acta, 42, 1085 1959 andChem. Ber., 103, 3783 1970 wherein oxidation of 3 3 chlorophenyl phthalimidine to the corresponding 3 hydroxy compound is described employing chromic acid acetic acid as the oxidizing agent. The oxidation can also be accomplished by simple contact with oxygen or an oxygen containing gas with or without catalyst present. The catalysts include ferrous ammonium sulfate, cupric sulfate, cobalt naphthenate, cuprous chloride, zinc chloride and the like ali of which give varying yields, in part predicated on varying time of reaction. Usually, reaction times can range from as little as about 8 hours up to about 24 hours and even longer.Significant yields of product are obtained when the reaction time ranges from about 15 to about 20 hours which is preferred when a catalyst is employed. Without added catalyst, the reaction times are considerably longer ranging from about 48 up to 72 hours for significant yields to be obtained. When oxygen is employed as the oxidant, the reaction is conveniently effected at room temperature as a matter of convenience, since temperature does not appear to play a critical role in the reaction. As an alternative to the foregoing oxidative methods, there may be employed the usual oxidizing agents to accomplish the desired oxygenation. For example, oxidants such as permangenates, peroxides, chromates, hypochlorites, such as t butyl and sodium hypochlorite, manganese dioxide, periodates, ferric ammo nium sulfate, bromine and the like can be used The time of reaction is usually within the range of 0.5 hour to about 60 hours depending on the reagent selected and the yield of product sought. For example with manganese dioxide, as little as one hour is sufficient to obtain high yields of the oxygenated product, whereas reaction times of up to 100 hours may be required with reagents such as ferric ammonium sulfate cupric sulfate in water at room temperature. In most cases, aqueous reaction media are employed and can be comprised of water alone or in mixtures with water miscible polar solvents such as dimethyformaide, tetrahydrofuran, acetone, dioxane, and the like. In addition, glacial acetic acid can be used as solvent, or in mixtures with water as co solvent. Conveniently, the deoxy phthalimidine can react with alkali to form water soluble salts, and, for more efficient oxidation, the substrate compounds are usually dissolved in water, or the aqueous solvent, by use of suitable alkali, such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate.The oxygenated products can be recovered from the aqueous reaction medium using suitable techniques such as extraction or precipitation. In the desoxy compounds used as starting materials for the oxygenation, it is preferred to avoid the presence of substituents X, Y and Z which would be reactive with oxygen under the reaction conditions. Thus, reactive groups such as amino groups, where present, should be blocked as by acylation and the blocking group removed after.oxygenation is completed.Alternatively, the reactive group, such as amino, can be formed after oxygenation, e.g. by reducing nitro to amino, and as necessary, converting amino to other substituents. The desoxy compounds of Formula II can, be prepared by conversion of the corresponding compounds of the formula EMI5.1 wherein,X, Y, and Z are as hereinbefore described andZ is O or NR in which R is as previously described. The preferred compounds are those of Formula IV wherein Y is halo or CF3 and X is NR1R2 as previously described. The conversion of Formula IV compounds to those ofFormula II is accomplished by reduction reaction, i.e. removal of the hetero oxygen or nitrogen atom from the heterocyclic ring. The reduction can be accomplished by art recognized procedures such as using zinc metal, conveniently zinc dust, and acid. The starting compound is dissolved in a suitable solvent system, usually a polar solvent, preferably watermiscible, as previously described. The water miscible solvent is convenient since it permits ready precipitation of the product by dilution with water. The solvent, starting compound, acid, preferably a mineral acid such as sulfuric or hydrochloric acid, and zinc dust are heated conveniently at the reflux temperature of the solvent system for reaction periods of about one to about four hours. For efficient reaction, the zinc dust is used in excess, usually about 10 20 fold molar excess, and the dust is added portionwise to the refluxing reaction mixture. After completion, the reaction mixture is diluted with cold water after removal of the zinc dust and the product separates. This reductive procedure can be used for both the benzoxazinones where Z is 0 and the phthalazinones where Z is NR . Of course, reductive procedures known for removal of O or NR from heterocyclic rings can also be employed. Compounds of Formula II can also be prepared by reaction of compounds of the following formula EMI6.1 to introduce substituent So2X, e.g. by halo sufonation to form the sulfonyl halide. If desired, the sulfonyl halides can then be reacted with suitable amines, HNR1R2, to form sulfonyl groups, with basic nitrogen compounds to form the sulfamyl group, e.g. reaction with ammonia to form the sulfonamide group. Intermediate compounds of the Formulae IV and V are known and can be prepared by art recognized procedures. For example, compounds of Formula V can be prepared from the corresponding phthalazinones or the corresponding benzoxazinones, usually by treatment with zinc dust by the method hereinbefore described. The phthalazinone and benzoxazinone compounds of Formula IV can be prepared by substitution reactions of the corresponding compounds wherein substituent Y is H, by substitution methods hereinbefore described. The synthesis of compounds of Formula I can be summarized by the following reaction sequence EMI7.1 tb Formula SEP V SEP O SEP a SEP Formula SEP II SEP SEP Formula SEP I tb SEP commat tb SEP Formula SEP IV tb SEP Formula SEP IV tb SEP wherein SEP Y SEP SEP H tb Reaction 1 is the hereinbefore described oxidation of the 3 position of the phthalimide ring. Reaction 2 is the hereinbefore described substitution reactions to introduce S02X substituents. Reaction 3 is the reductive removal of O or NR from the benzoxazinone or phthalazinone ring. In those compounds of Formulae IV and V wherein z is 0, the conversion thereof to compounds of Formula II must include the conversion of Z from 0 to NR as previously defined. This conversion can be accomplished by treatment with ammonia or suitable amines, e.g. as described in U.S. Patent 3,055,904. The present synthetic routes to compounds of FormulaI herein are particularly adaptable for commercial production of the said compounds in that substantial economic advantage is offered by the present routes in comparison to those of the prior art. Employing the procedures described herein, a variety of compounds of Formulae II, III, IV, V and VI can be prepared with various substituent as hereinafter illustrated.
