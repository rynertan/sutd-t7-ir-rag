# An electronically controllable dual fuel system for an internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
A liquid fuel injection system incorporates an injector pump 10 for delivering prescribed quantities of a principal liquid fuel e.g. diesel oil under pressure to individual injectors 21 for cylinders of an engine 6 and comprises an electronic control unit 7 , an electrically controllable variable flow regulator 1 arranged to receive a combustible alternative fuel e.g. a gas such as CNG or LPG under pressure and deliver controlled quantities of the alternative fuel to the engine as determined by signals received by and transmitted from said electronic control unit 7 , and by pass bleed means 22 for bleeding fuel from the principal fuel injection system 10, 20 at the output side of the injector pump 1 and before the injectors 21 and by passing the bled fuel to a by pass control system 23, 24, 27, 28 .
