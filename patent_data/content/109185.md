# High temperature box annealing furnace.

## Abstract
A high temperature box annealing furnace 1 for metal lic coil annealing practices. The furnace comprises a fixed base 2 and a removable bell 3 capable of achieving a sealed relationship with the base. The interior of the bell side walls 37, 38 , end walls 35, 36 and roof 34 are lined with ceramic fiber insulation 48 52 and are provided with electrical resistance heating elements 53 70 . The heating elements are divided into at least two separately con trollable zones, a first zone including the heating elements 69, 70 mounted on the bell roof and the upper portions of the bell side 61, 65 and end walls 53, 57 and a second one including the heating elements mounted on the lower portion of the bell side 62 64, 66 68 and end walls 54 56, 58 60 . The base comprises a steel framework 5, 6, 7, 7a supporting a cast refractory base memner 11 configured to support one or more coils 15, 16, 17 . Each coil is provided with a cover 21, 22, 23 and the cast refractory base member provides a sand seal 14 for the lower edge of the covers. The cast refractory base has an atmospnere inlet 18, 19, 20 for each coil positioned at the center or eye of the coil. Cooling capacity for the furnace is provided by in lets 80 and outlets 81 for an appropriate cooling gas.
