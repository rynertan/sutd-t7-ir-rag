# Translator bar conveyor installation for displacing components, particularly motor vehicle components, along an assembly line.

## Abstract
A conveyor installation for the displacement of compo nents along an assembly line, which includes a series of consecutive work stations, comprises a pair of horizontal translator bars 20 which extend laterally along the assem bly line 10 and are reciprocally movable, and a series of spaced support units 26 carried by the bars and movable relative thereto, and thus relative to the work stations 5 of the assembly line, between a lowered position and a raised position. Actuator means 56, 80, 82 are provided to control the simultaneous displacement of the supports between a lowered position and a raised position to permit respectively the setting down of the components at the stations and the transfer of these components, on completion of the opera tions, to the consecutive stations in the assembly line, by means of the translator bars.
