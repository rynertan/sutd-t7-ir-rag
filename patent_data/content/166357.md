## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTIONBenzofused lactams and pharmaceutical compositions containing them.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Cholecystokinin CCK is a neuropeptide composed of thirty three aminoacids. See Mutt andJorpes, Biochem. J. 125 678 1971 . The carboxyl terminal octapeptide CCK 8 also occurs naturally and is fully active. CCK exists in both gastrointestinal tissue and the central nervous system. IV. Mutt, Gastrointestinal Hormones, G. B. J. Glass, Ed., Raven Press, N.Y., 1980 p. 169. CCK is believed to play an important role in appetite regulation and CCK may be a physiological satiety hormone. G. P. Smith, Eating and Its Disorders, A.J. Stunkard and E. Stellar, Eds, Raven Press, NewYork, 1984, p. 67. Among additional effects of CCX are stimulation of colonic motility, stimulation of gall bladder contraction, stimulation of pancreatic enzyme secretion, and inhibition of gastric emptying. CCX reportedly co exists with dopamine in certain mid brain neurons and thus may also play a role in the functioning of dopaminergic systems in the brain as well as serving as a neurotransmitter in its own right. See A. J. Prange et al., Peptides in theCentral Nervous System , Ann. Repts. Med. Chem. 17 31, 33 1982 and references cited therein J. A.Williams, Biomed. Res. 3, 479 107 1982 and J. E.Morley, Life Sci. 30 1982 1. CCX antagonists are useful in the treatment and prevention of CCK related disorders of the gastrointestinal, central nervous and appetite regulatory systems of animals, especially humans.Three distinct chemical classes of CCK receptor antagonists have been reported. One class comprises derivatives of cyclic nucleotides detailed structure function studies have demonstrated that of the various members of this class, dibutyryl cyclicGMP is the most potent. See N. Barlos et al., Am.J. Physiol., 242, G161 1982 and P. Robberecht et al., Mol., Pharmacol., 17, 268 1980 . The second class comprises peptide antagonists which areC terminal fragments and analogs of CCK. Recent structure function studies have shown that both shorter C terminal fragments of CCX Boc Met Asp Phe NH2, Met Asp Phe NH2 as well as longer CCX fragments Cbz Tyr S03H Met Gly TrpMet Asp NH2 can function as CCX antagonists. See R. T. Jensen et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta., 757, 250 1983 and M. Spanarkel et al., J. Biol. Chem., 258, 6746 1983 . The third class of CCK receptor antagonists comprises the amino acid derivatives proglumide, a derivative of glutaramic acid, and theN acyl tryptophans including para chlorobenzoyl Ltryptophan benzotript . See W. F. Hahne et al.,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.U.S.A., 78, 6304 1981 andR. T. Jensen et al., Biochem. Biophys. Acta., 761, 269 1983 . All of these compounds are relatively weak antagonists of CCX IC50 10 4 10 6M .

Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer s solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables. A composition of the invention may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials are cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols. For topical use, creams, ointments, jellies, solutions or suspensions, etc., containing the compositions of the invention are employed. Treatment dosage for human beings can be varied as necessary. Generally, daily dosages of the compounds of the invention can range from about 0.5 mg to about 1,000 mg preferably, from about 5 mgs to about 500 mg. The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration.For example, a formulation intended for oral administration may contain, for example, from 5 mg to 500 mg of active agent compounded with an appropriate and convenient amount of carrier material which may vary from about 5 to about 95 percent of the total composition. The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy.

Alternatively, 3 may be alkylated in the presence of a strong base, like sodium hydride, and the intermediate 6 converted to 7 by reaction with an azide salt as described above. Intermediate 7 may be reductively coupled with an aldehyde, ketone, keto acid or ketoester in a solvent such as ethanol using a catalyst such as palladium on carbon to afford la X absent . la may also be prepared using sodium cyanoborohydride to effect reduction. Alternatively, intermediate 7 may be coupled with a carboxylic acid using a coupling agent such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide DCC and an activator such as l hydroxybenzotriazole HOBt in an aprotic solvent such as chloroform or THF to affordEMI22.1 Compound lb can also be prepared by reacting 7 with an acid chloride and a tertiary amine such as triethylamine in an aprotic solvent such as chloroform or THF. The acid chloride is prepared from a carboxylic acid and thionyl chloride or PC13 in an aprotic solvent such as chloroform.Process B Compound la Y CO2H may be further elaborated as follows. The acid la can be reacted with an alkoxychloroformate such as ethylchloroformate , a tertiary amine such as triethylamine in an aprotic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran THF to give, upon filtration, a mixed anhydride intermediate which is then reacted with an excess of diazomethane in ether to give diazomethylketone 8 . Reaction of 8 with trifluoroacetic acid TFA . Followed by stirring in methanol or ethanol gives hydroxymethyl ketone lc.EMI23.1 In the above preparations, the keto acid or ester can be represented by the formulaEMI23.2 and may be, for example, 2 oxo 4 phenyl butyric acid. Other a keto acids or esters may be utilized to prepare other compounds of the present invention for various definitions of R and R1. Such a keto acids are readily available or may be prepared by well known techniques. For example, synthons such as EMI24.1 can be converted to a keto acids or esters using methods involving alkylation followed by hydrolysis as described in the literature. An excellent method involves the reaction of Grignard reagents R1MgX with ClCOCO2Y or YO2CCO2Y. Another method involves condensing substituted acetic acid esters with diethyl oxalate followed by hydrolytic decarboxylation under acidic conditions to obtain a keto acids. Carefully controlled acid hydrolysis in alcohol of acyl cyanides, which are prepared from acid chlorides and cuprous cyanide, also proves to be a viable synthetic route to a keto esters.Nucleophilic displacement reactions on chloro or bromo pyruvic acid ester can also be used to produce a variety of interesting a keto acids esters . In these formulae, Y is a group such as loweralkyl or benzyl and protecting groups are employed as necessary in the R1 group if an interfering functionality is present. Additional compounds of Formula 1 can be prepared by employing the keto acids and esters listed in Table I below.
