# Two cable shifting mechanism for transmissions.

## Abstract
In a remote shifter for a vehicle transmission, a transmitter unit is located near the vehicle operator while a receiver unit is mounted on the transmission. The transmitter and receiver are coupled by flexible push pull cables 16 , 14 that transfer the motion of a gearshift lever 12 operated by the vehicle opera tor to the transmission to select and engage the desired gears in the transmission. The shift lever 12 is operable in two in dependent modes of pivotal motion about orthogonal axes. Motion in a first mode controls gear rail selection in the trans mission and motion in a second mode controls gear engage ment. The transmitter couples the gearshift lever to the cables so that pivotal motion of the gearshift lever in a transverse plane is translated to linear motion of the select control cable 14 while pivotal motion of the gearshift lever in the fore aft plane is translated to linear motion of the shift control cable 16 . The transmitter maintains the motion of the two cables independent of one another. The receiver translates linear mo tion of the select control cable into linear motion of an output shaft that couples the receiver to the vehicle transmission and translates linear motion of the shift control cable into rotational motion of the same output shaft. The receiver linkage main tains independence of the motions of each of the cables and maintains independence of the two modes of motion of the out put shaft.
