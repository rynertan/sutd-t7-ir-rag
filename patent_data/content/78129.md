# Method and apparatus for the continuous oxygen delignification of fibrous materials.

## Abstract
Method and apparatus for the good temperature and pH control as well as the uniform mixing of pulp or other fibrous materials, achieved in a medium consistency oxygen deligni fication system. Alkaline chemicals 30 are sprayed, option ally using oxygen gas 40 as the atomizing agent, into the gas space above the level of pulp maintained in one or more substantially horizontal tubular reaction vessels 10 . At least a part of the steam requirement of the reaction is added only after the major portion of alkaline chemicals has been added to the system. The fibrous materials are combined with a first alkaline chemical 30,34 and then introduced at a consistency of from 8 20 into the reaction zone 10 . Oxygen gas 40 and a second alkaline chemical 30,32 which optionally may be different from the first one 30 are then introduced into the reaction zone 10 . The partially delignified mixture is introduced into a second reaction zone 22 through a substantially vertical conduit 26 , whereby a second portion of alkaline chemicals 30,32,52 is added to said mixture as it falls through the conduit 26 .
