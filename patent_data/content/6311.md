# Sealing assembly.

## Abstract
The invention is concerned with sealing assemblies of the type comprising two members which are movable rela tive to one another and in which one of the members has a cylindrical surface and the other member contains an annular groove, a sealing ring being located in the annular groove and engaging the cylindrical surface. A problem with such sealing assemblies is that, when they are sub jected to substantial pressure diffenrentials, unacceptably high leakage of gas or liquid past the seal can occur. Such leakage is reduced in a sealing assembly in accordance with the invention in that one 22 of the radially extending walls of the sealing ring 20 includes a chamfered portion 24 such that the axial dimension of the radially inner sur face of the sealing ring 20 is less than the axial dimen sion of the radially outer surface of the sealing ring, the annular groove including a complementary shaped wedging surface 26 for co operation with the chamfered surface 24 of the sealing ring 20 .
