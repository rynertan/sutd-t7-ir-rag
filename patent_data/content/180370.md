# A printer including paper feed and eject control apparatus.

## Abstract
In a paper feed and eject control apparatus for a printer, a printing paper sheet 45 is automatically feed by a paper feed roller 48 through a paper feed guide 63 and is ejected by a paper eject roller 70 through a paper eject guide 67 , both of the rollers 48, 70 being driven by a single roller drive motor. Since the paper feed 63 and eject 67 passages are arranged separately, the paper feed operation is not impeded by a previ ous paper sheet being ejected, thus enabling high speed print ing operation. The paper feed roller 48 is securely located at a stand by position without the use of an additional control sensor.
