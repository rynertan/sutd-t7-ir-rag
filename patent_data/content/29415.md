# PROCESS AND MACHINE FOR MAKING THE HEAD AND TAIL JUNCTIONS BETWEEN THIN METAL STRIPS

## Abstract
A process and the related machine for making the head and tail junctions of thin metal strips are disclosed, wherein the process comprises the steps of piercing, through full thickness, the overlapping head and tail ends of two adjoining, aligned metal strips 1, 2 with both for mation of, and drawing along the edge portions 1 of the holes in the strips 1, 2 on the underside of the lower strip 2 , and then turning in and squeezing said edge portions 1 of the holes in the strips 1, 2 against said underside of the lower strip 2 . The machine for carrying into effect the above described process is equipped with punches 8 for piercing the holes and forming the burrs 1 , as well as with devices 11 effective to move apart the burrs 1 of the strips 1, 2 so as to spread them around the hole periphery, and 12 for squeezing said spreading burrs 1 against the underside of the lower strip 2 . There are obtained, in this way, head and tail joined strips which are firmly and tightly connected to one another without the need for interposition of any auxiliary material as adhesive, etc. there between, and with cutting down on both the working time and the operating and finished product costs.
