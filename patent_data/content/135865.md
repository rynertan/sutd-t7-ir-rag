# CHAIR TILTING MECHANISM

## Abstract
A mechanism for connection to a chair and to a base for allowing the chair to tilt forward and backward and from side to side relative to the base when the base is supported on a floor. The mechanism includes a support in the form of a hous ing mounted on a base by horizontal pin for forward and back ward tilting movement on the base. A plate is mounted on the support for pivotal movement from side to side, the plate adapted to be coupled to the underside of the chair. A pair of torsion bars is carried by the support and serves to exert a spring bias force on the support when the chair is tilted back wardly relative to the base. The two torsion bars can be cou pled in a manner to limit the spring bias effect of one of the tor sion bars so that adjustments in the spring loading can be made as to the size and weight of a person sitting in the chair. A third torsion bar controls the spring bias force exerted on the plate secured to the underside of the chair during side to side movement thus, the chair can be tilted forwardly and backwardly and from side to side, yet spring bias forces will be exerted on the chair to return the chair to an equilibrium posi tion. Several embodiments of the mechanism are disclosed.
