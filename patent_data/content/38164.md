# Registration control system and method.

## Abstract
A system for controlling registration in a printing press between a moving web 10 having repetitive print patterns and a work station 19 operated cyclically in synchronization with the press. The system includes a photoelectric scanner 16 having a variable sensitivity, a position pulse generator 39 with a backup accumulating device, a motorized compensator 13 for controlling the longitudinal position of the web 10 rel ative to the work station 19 and a digital control system 34 for driving the compensator 13 to correct misregistration. The control system 34 counts position pulses during each cycle of the work station 19 , defines a monitoring period dur ing which marks 30 on the web 10 are scanned, and signals differences between the cycles of the print markings and the work station 19 by sampling, at the occurrence of each mark 30 , a digital number which corresponds to the instantaneous position of the work station 19 and its cycle. To enhance se lectivity the system employs a variable sensitivity scanner, a variable duration monitoring period or window and automatic setup apparatus that synchronizes the system to those por tions of the web 10 which are most distinctive and unclut tered.
