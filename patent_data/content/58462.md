# Closure system.

## Abstract
Known apparatuses to inject liquids, in particular plas tics into injection moulds have closure rods which keep staying in the gating when the closure system is opened. In the invented apparatus the liquid passage always is com pletely free when the closure system is opened, because the closure rod can totally be retracted from the liquid passage. This can be brought into practice in two ways either the liquid passage extends in a bended manner or the closure rod has a side view in the configuration of a sector of a circle.
