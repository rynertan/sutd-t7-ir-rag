# Reference signal reproduction apparatus.

## Abstract
The phase of a reproduction reference signal RS output from a decoder 30 , which decodes the count value of the counter 20 , is compared with that of an arriving horizontal synchronizing signal TH by a phase comparator. Based on this comparison result, a phase discriminating circuit 80 discriminates whether the phase of the reproduction refer ence signal RS is advanced, delayed or in phase with the arriving horizontal synchronizing signal TH. Based on this phase discrimination result, the dividing ratio setting circuit 90 sets the dividing ratio of the counter 20 such that the reproduction reference signal TH is pulled in with the arriving horizontal synchronizing signal TH.
