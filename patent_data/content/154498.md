# Process and apparatus for producing particulate pigment.

## Abstract
A process and apparatus for producing pigments, such as, particulate phthalocyanine pigments, particularly for green shade phthalocyanine blue pigments. To effect de velopment of the pigment tintorial strength by reduction of the pigment particle size, the pigment particles 32 are directed in a substantially linear path and are repeatedly impacted against relatively fixed impact plates 22 by entrainment in moving air streams 38 . Repeated impacting of the particulate pigment provides significant reduction in its particle size and significant development of the tinctorial strength of the pigment.
