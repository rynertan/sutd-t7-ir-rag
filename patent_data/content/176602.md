# OPTICAL DISC PLAYER.

## Abstract
An optical disc player in accordance with this invention has a construction in which a chassis to which an optical pickup, a disc table, and the like, are fitted, is supported on a frame at a plurality of positions by resilient support means, a container portion sealing therein a viscous fluid is disposed or either the frame or the chassis, and a migration member disposed on the other of the frame and the chassis is placed in the viscous fluid. According to this construction, the rise of the Q value in the resonance range is small resulting in improved vibration resistance, and the variation of sound is difficult to occur.
