# Color picture analyzing apparatus for continuously switching on green lamp and for alternatively switching on blue and red purpose lamps.

## Abstract
A color picture analyzing apparatus comprises a blue, green, and red pupose lamps, preferably, fluorescent lamps, a sharp cut filter in front of the red purpose lamp for solely passing the red radiation, an infrared cut filter interposed between a document having a color picture to be analyzed and a reading sensor for cutting an infrared zone radiation, and a first circuit for continuously switching on the green lamps, a second circuit for alternatively switching on the blue and the red purpose lamps. The red purpose lamp can provide wide radiations covering the red spectral zone. It may be a cool white fluorescent lamp having a short afterglow time.
