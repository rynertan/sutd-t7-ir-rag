# Means for measuring a radial force.

## Abstract
Known devices for measuring rubber seal contact forces are not able to produce repeatable and reliable results mainly due to the fact that they comprise a lot of transmission parts such as bars and coupling means. This problem is solved by using a coupled double beam Z beam load cell arrangement 11 in a specific gauge design 6 . This type of load cell has a high resistance to side loads and moments, and the output is virtually independent of the load position. These properties of the load cell offer the advantage of having a simplified seal lip load gauge design 6 with improved performance. Also very good repeatabil ity has been found in the measurements with this new type of seal lip load gauge. Features for fast and accurate contact force measurements are the adaption of conical shaped mandrels 16 with an optimum angle for the measuring sector.
