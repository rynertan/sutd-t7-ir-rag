## Abstract
A dot printing device includes a head 25 having a plurality of dot printing elements P1 to P9 , a head driver 2, 22 for selectively energizing the dot printing elements P1 to P9 according to dot data, a character generator 10 , the data processing unit 1, 3, 4 which causes designated character data to be generated from said character generator 10 according to first input data including character designation data and underline data and transfers the designated character data together with one bit dot data representing an underline to the head driver 2, 22 . The data processing unit 1, 3, 4 operates according to second input data including character designation data, underline data and double height data to print an upper half portion of the designated character data in a first printing cycle and transfers dot data representing a lower half of the designated character data and two bit dot data representing an underline to the head driver in a second printing cycle 2, 22 .
