## Description
POLYAMINE FOR USE AS A MEDICINE IN THE TREATMENT OF NEOPLASMS.This invention relates to certain polyamines for use as a medicine. In particular, this invention relates to certain polyamine for use in the treatment of neoplasms, either alone or in conjunctive therapy with ornithine decarboxylase inhibitors and or S adenosylmethionine decarboxylase inhibitors or in conjuntion with other known cytotoxic agents, or with Interferon.More specifically, this invention relates to the treatment of neoplasms with polyamines of the formulaEMI1.1 and the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof, wherein X is CH2 , NR, O, S, SO or SO2,R is H, C16 lower alkyl or benzyl, each ofR1 and R3 independently are H, C1 6 lower alkyl, CH2 3NH2,EMI1.2 alkyl, orEMI1.3 each ofR2 and R4 independently are H or C1 6 lower alkyl, is a C3 lower alkylene moiety optionally substituted with a C1 4 lower alkyl moiety radical1 andB is a C24 lower alkylene moiety optionally substituted with a C14 lower alkyl radical. In the definition of the compounds of formula I, the C1 C6 alkyl radical includes straight or branched chain saturated aliphatic hydrocarbyl radicals having up to six carbon atoms, with methyl, ethyl and hexyl being preferred. The alkylene moieties of the A and B designations include the ethylene CH2 2 , propylene CH2 3 and butylene ti CH2 4 7 straight chain radicals each of which may also be substituted with a methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl radical. When X is CH2 then the combination of A, X and B moieties represent a straight chain alkylene having 6 9 carbon atoms optionally but not preferentially bearing one or two 01 C4 alkyl radicals.Included within the NR definition are the mono and di substituted N benzyl compounds wherein the substituents are hydroxy, halogen, C1 C4 alkyl, and C1 C4 alkoxy. The 3 ,4 di hydroxy and the 3 ,4 dimethoxy substituted benzyl moieties being preferred. The term 1halogen is intended to encompass chloro, bromo, iodo and fluoro atoms. In practice, it is preferred to employ those compounds ofFormula I wherein all of R1, R21 R3 or R4 are hydrogen or wherein R1 and R3 are aminopropyl and R2 and R4 are hydrogen. Another preference is when A and B are unsubstituted. Still another preference is when A and B each represent a propylene moiety. A further preference when A and B are other than propylene in that B represents an alkylene moiety having one less carbon atom than the alkylene moiety for A.Still another preference is that X represent either CR2 or NR. When X is CR2 it is preferred that the combined moieties of A, X and B represent a straight chain alkylene moiety having 8 carbon atoms, preferentially neither A or B bearing any lower alkyl sudstituents. When X is other than CR2, the preferred X moiety is NH, wherein, in that instance, the preferred compound is norspermidine, a compound wherein X is NH, A and B is an unsubstituted propylene moiety and each of R1, R2, R3 and R4 is hydrogen. Still another preference is when norspermidine is substituted such that either or both of Rl and R3 are aminopropyl. The most preferred compounds are those wherein X is CH2 with R1 andR3 being aminopropyl.The most preferred compound being N,N bis 3 aminopropyl 1, 8 octanediamine. In practice, the compounds are believed to be useful in the treatment of neoplasms which are dependent upon polyamine biosynthesis for their growth. Such neoplasms include leukemia, including but not limited to acute lymphoblastic, chronic lymphocytic, acute myloblastic and chronic mylocytic Carcinomas, including but not limited to those of the cervix, oesphagus, stomach, small intestines, colon and lungs Sarcomas, including but not limited to oesteroma, osteosarcoma, lepoma, liposarcoma, hemangioma and hemangiosarcoma Adenomas, both benign and malignant, including, for example, the thyroid, parathyroid, prostate and the like Melanomas, including amelonotic and melanotic and mixed types of neoplasias such as, for example, adenocarcinoma, carcinosarcoma, lymphoid tissue type, folicullar reticulum, cell sarcoma and Hodgkins Disease. In effecting treatment of the neoplastic disease state, it is preferred to administer a compound of formula I to a patient suffering from a neoplasm with about 15 100 mg per kilogram of body weight per day. The specific amount depends upon the severity of the state of the neoplasm such as say be determined by the attending diagnostician. In practice, the ideal is to deprive the diseased cell of its opportunity for proliferative cell growth by inhibiting polyamine biosynthesis. Thus, in the practice of this invention, it is preferred that a sufficient blood level of the polyamine of formula I be maintained so as to inhibit polyamine biosynthesis and, more specifically, to inhibit the formation of putrescine and spermidine.The precise dosage required to maintain the desired blood level of the polyamine of formula I to inhibit polyamine biosynthesis specifically inhibition of putrescine and spermidine may be determined by the use of standard pharmaco kinetic studies well established for these determinations. Of course the compounds of this invention may be administered to a patient orally, intravenouslyt intraperitoneally and or subcutaneously, preferably orally. In any case, the pharmaceutical preparations may be effected by standard techniques well Lnown in the art. The term treatment of neoplasms is meant to include treating the patient having neoplasms so that the therapy has an advantageous effect by wcontrolling the growth of neoplasm, which for the purposes of this invention includes slowing, interrupting, arresting or stopping the growth and metastases of the proliferating tumor tissue in a warm blooded animal it being understood that such does not necessarily provide for a cure for the tumor in the sense that the tumor tissue is totally eliminated. Another aspect of this invention is to utilize he compounds of this invention with ornithine decarboxylase inhibitors IODC inhibitors and or S adenosylmethionine decarboxylase inhibitors SAM DC inhibitors . Although any of the functional irreversible ODC inhibitors may be utilized in conjunctive therapy with the compounds of formula I, compounds such as methyl acetylenic putrescine and compounds of the formulaeEMI5.1 wherein X is CHF2 or CH2F,R is H or COR1,R1 is OH or C16 alkoxy, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts and individual optical isomers thereof are preferred. Particularly preferred compounds are i difluoromethyl ornithine DFMO , the methyl and ethyl esters of monofluoromethyl dehydroonithine, and the R,R isomer of methyl acetylenic putrescine i.e., 2B, SB 6 heptyne 2,5 diamine . Other agents with which the compounds of this invention may be utilized in conjunctive therapy are cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, prednisone, 6 mercaptopurine, chlorambucil, cytosine arabinoside, 6 thioguanine, thio TEPA, 5 fluorouracil, 5 fluoro 2 deoxyuridine, 5 azacytidine, nitrogen mustard, 1,3 bis 2 chloroethy1 1 nitrosourea BCNU , 1 2 chloroethyl 3 cyclohexyl 1nitrosourea CCNU , busulfan, adriamycin, bleomycin, vindesine, cycloleucine or methylglyoxal bis guanylhydrazone i.e., MGBG . In a preferred manner, a compound of this invention can be administered with an ODC or SAM DC inhibitor, or a known cytotoxic agent known to be useful in tumor therapy. When such combination therapy is employed for the treatment of a tumor, the cytotoxic agent may be administered at a dosage known in the art to be effective for treating the tumor. However, the combination with an ODC inhibitor may produce an additive or synergistic effect with the compounds of formula I or with a cytotoxic agent against a particular tumor. Thus, when such combination antitumor therapy is used, the dosage of the cytotoxic agent administered may be less than that administered when the cytotoxic agent is used alone.In combination with an ODC inhibitor, the compounds of this invention or the cytotoxic agent may, therefore, be administered at a lower dosage level or at less frequent intervals as compared to the cytotoxic agent when used alone. Similarly, when a compound of this invention is used with an ODC inhibitor, alone or in combination with a cytotoxic or other herein mentioned therapeutic agent, the dosage of the ODC inhibitor or other conjunctively utilized agent, may be less then when used without a compound of this invention i.e., the compound of formula I .The term combination therapy or conjunctive therapy refers to the simultaneous, separate or sequential use of a preparation in the specified treatment. 1Combination1 and combination therapy, conjunction and conjunction therapy are therefore held to encompass also the case where the active components of the combination or conjunction are parts of a medical kit, collection or package containing them in separate form or their existence as a medical kit collection of package, although as such not immediately evident, become evident in view of the indication of purpose for the combined therapy. The term combination therapy or conjunctive therapy contemplates therefore, for example, the administration of an ODC inhibitor immediately prior to the beginning of therapy with a compound of this invention and a cytotoxic agent, concomitantly with such therapy, or during the period of time immediately following cessation of such therapy.Preferably, the patient is treated with an ODC inhibitor for about 1 to 14 days, preferably 4 to 14 days, prior to the beginning of therapy with a cytotoxic agent, and thereafter, on a daily basis during the course of such therapy. Daily treatment with the ODC inhibitor can be continued for a period of, for example, 1 to 365 days after the last dose of the cytotoxic agent is administered.As pharmacologically useful agents, the compounds of this invention can be administered in various ways to the patient being treated to achieve the desired effect.The compounds can be administered either alone or in combination with one another, or they can be administered with the other aforementioned compounds of this invention in the form of pharmaceutical compositions, the preparation of which are well known in the art. The compounds may be administered orally or parenterally for example, intravenously, intraperitoneally or subcutaneously , including injection of the active ingredient directly into the tumor. The amount of compound administered will vary over a wide range and can be any effective amount.Depending upon the patient to be treated, the severity of the condition being treated, the mode of administration, and the particular compound employed, the effective amount of compound of this invention I administered will vary from about 15 mg Rg to 100 mg Kg of body weight of the patient per day and preferably will be about 25 mg Kg to 50 ngiKg of body weight of patient per day.The solid unit dosage forms can be of the conventional type. Thus, the solid form can be a capsule which can be of the ordinary gelatin type containing a novel compound of this invention and a carrier, for example, lubricant and inert fillers, such as lactose, sucrose or corn starch in combination with binders such as acacia, corn starch or gelatin, desintegrating agents such as corn starch, potato starch or alginic acid, and a lubricant such as stearic acid or magnesium stearate.For parenteral administration, the compounds may be administered as injectable dosages of a solution or suspension of the compound in a physiologically acceptable diluent with a pharmaceutical carrier which can be a sterile liquid such a water and oils with or without the addition of a surfactant and other pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvants. Illustrative of oils which can be employed in these preparations are those of petroleum, animal, vegetable to synthetic origin, for example, peanut oil, soyben oil and mineral oil. In general, water, saline, aqueous dextrose and related sugar solutions, ethanols and glycols such as propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol are preferred liquid carriers, particularly for injectable solutions.The results in the treatment of rapidly proliferating tumor tissue disease states when used in combination with compounds of this invention have demonstrated a striking tumor supression and such results can be shown and ascertained by standard and well known laboratory techniques as may be illustrated by the following.

Still another aspect of this invention is the treatment of the hereinabove mentioned neoplastic disease states utilizing a polyamine of formula I in conjunctive therapy with Interferon this combination may be alone or in a further combination with an irreversible ODC inhibitor and or known cytotoxic agents. The preferred ODC inhibitors again are alpha monofluoromethyl ornithine, alpha difluoromethyl ornithine, the methyl and ethyl esters of monofluoromethyl dihydroornithine and the R,R isomer of methyl acetylenic putrescine although any of the above defined ODC inhibitors of formula I and I may be used. According to this aspect of the invention the term Interferon is used in its generic meaning. Although known for over twenty years, Interferon has not yet been sufficiently characterized as to be subject to a precise definition and thus some difficulty arises in the use of the term. However, it is a term that is attached to those glycoproteins which are made by all animal cells after viral attack, and which function as regulating functionaries of the immune system. Interferon has also been made biosynthetically by recombinant DNA techniques and thus the precise characterization and or nomenclature of such substance has been further complicated.However, as used in the art and in the context of this application, the term Interferon is meant to include all those natural and biosynthetic interferons capable of immunomodulation and include Type I and Type II interferons as well as the recombinant DNA types. Type I interferons also sometimes called leucocyte interferons include those N and p interferons generally prepared from leucocytes by viral infection. Type II interferons, sometimes called immunoactive interferon interferon are those which are generally prepared from lymphocytic reactions with mitogenes. Although, as stated above, the recombinant interferons are included herein, the immune and leucocyte interferons are preferred. Aso included within the concept of the present invention is the embodiment of the treatment of tumor tissue with ODC inhibitors andInterferon when the Interferon is generated by the use ofInterferon inducers e.g., tilorone and its related analogs known a interferon inducers which, in induce the release of Interferon. A still further aspect of this invention is the use of a polyaine of formula I and Interferon in conjunctive therapy with known non steroidal antiandrogenic agents e.g., Plutamide and the like , with or without the added effects of ODC inhibitors, in the treatment of androgendependent disease states such as benign prostatic hypertrophy, prostatic carcinoma, mammary carcinoma and other androgen dependent tumor sites throughout the body.When a polyamine of formula I is used with Interferon in combination with an ODC inhibitor in conjunction with a cytotoxic agent lost known cytotoxic agents may be employed. Illustrative examples of cytotoxic agents are cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, prednisone, 6 mercaptopur ine, procarbazine, daunorubicin, vincristine, cinblastine, chlorambucil, cytosine arabinoside, 6 thioguanine, thio TEPA, 5 Eluorouracil, 5 fluoro 2deoxyuridine, 5 azacytidine, nitrogen mustard, 1,3 bis 2chloroethyl 1 nitrosourea BCNU , 1 2 chloroethyl 3 cyclohexyl 1 nitrosourea COW , busulfan, adriamycin, bleomycin, bindesine, cycloleucine or methylglyoxal bis guanylhydrazone i.e., MGBG . For the lost part, the compounds of formula I are known compounds. Those few which are novel My readily by prepared by analogous techniques well known to those in the art. More specifically, those compounds of formula I wherein any of the R groups are hydrogen are known or else may be made by analogous and routine techniques.Preparation of the amido, acyl, aroyl, alkyl and benzyl derivatives may readily be effected by standard techniques. For example, the N alkylation or Nbenzylation of the central nitrogen atom i.e., wherein X is NH is effected by first forming a Schiff s base at the nitrogen atoms attached to the A and wB alkylene moieties these nitrogen atoms will hereinafter be referred to as terminal nitrogen atoms . The formation of the Schiff s bases is effected by reaction of the polyamine with an aldehyde preferably benzaldehyde in an inert organic solvent e.g., methylene chloride in the presence of a molecular sieve.Following the formation of the Schiff bases, the central hydrogen atom is alkylated or benzylated by forming an anion with sodium hydride and the resulting anion is reacted with the appropriate alkyl or benzyl halide. The Schiff bases are then converted to the amines by hydrolysis in dilute aqueous acid according to standard techniques. To form the amides i.e., those compounds wherein R1 and R3 contain the acyl or aroyl moiety , the appropriate intermediate is reacted with an acyl or aroyl halide or anhydride, using standard amidation techniques, taking the usual step of first protecting the center nitrogen atom according to standard techniques. Following the amidation, the N protecting group is removed according to standard and well known techniques. The compounds of formula I wherein X is oxygen are readily prepared from a terminal amide terminal nitrile alkyl ether IV which are prepared by the action of a sodium alkoxide of the appropriate haloalkyl nitrile in an inert organic solvent e.g., THF according to the following reaction scheme EMI20.1 wherein R is lower alkyl or phenyl, m is 4 or 3 and n is 4, 3 or 2. Compounds of IV are chemically reduced by the action of hydrogen in the presence of an Adams catalyst,PtO2 and an alkyl or aroyl anhydride or mixed anhydride to yield aides of the formulaEMI20.2 Hydrolysis with refluxing 6N.HCl yields the bis unsubstituted amino compounds.Lithium aluminum hydride reduction of the aide V yields the bis N alkylated orN benzylated compounds. Should the tetra alkyl derivatives i.e., the bis dialkyl derivatives be desired, the sequential acylation reduction procedures nay be repeated on the dialkyl derivatives. Those compounds for formula I wherein X is S are prepared by the Michael addition reaction of an amino substituted thiol with acrylonitrile to yield the desired amino nitrile e.g., H2NASBCN according to standard conditions and techniques. Standard reduction procedures e.g. r using LiAlH4 or catalytic hydrogenation are utilized to convert the nitrile to the desired compounds of formula I i.e., those wherein X is S, and R1, R2, R3 and R4 are hydrogen . Oxidation of these thioether compounds to the corresponding sulfoxide is effected by reaction of the thioether with sodium metaperiodate in water or aqueous ethanol according to standard techniques.Further oxidation to the sulfone i.e., X is SO2 is effected with a peracid e.g., meta chlorobenzoic acid in an organic solvent e.g., chloroform or dichloromethane .The sulfone may also be prepared from the thioether using two equivalents of the peracid. As previously described, the amines may be acylated by reaction with an acyl halide or acid anhydride under standard conditions. The resulting bis amide may be reduced with LiAlH4 to yield the dialkyl derivatives. Should the tetra alkyl derivatives i.e., the bis dialkyl derivatives be desired, the sequential acylation reduction procedures may be repeated on the dialkyl derivatives. Conversion of the compounds of formula I can be converted to their pharmaceutically acceptable salts using standard techniques e.g., neutralizing with hydrochloric acid . Although, in general, the compounds of formula I are already known in the art, for following examples typify their preparation.
