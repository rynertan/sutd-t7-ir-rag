# Head for checking linear dimensions.

## Abstract
A support 1 defining a longitudinal geometric axis movably carries, through connection means 5 7, 10, 11, 14, 15, 20, 23 , an arm 2 bearing a feeler 3 for contacting a workpiece 4 to be checked. Detecting means 18, 19, 24, 25 detect the displacements of the arm 2 from a rest position. In order to permit broad displacements of the movable arm 2 as well as a sturdy and reliable structure having, if desired, small dimensions, the connection means comprise distinct adjacent members 5 7 and fulcrum means includ ing balls 10, 11, 20 arranged between adjacent members 5 7 . Springs 16, 17 apply to the balls 10, 11, 20 and the members 5 7 forces maintaining the members 5 7 in contact with the relevant balls 10, 11, 20 .
