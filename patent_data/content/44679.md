# Method of producing gaseous oxygen and a cryogenic plant in which said method can be performed.

## Abstract
In a pumped liquid oxygen plant the liquid oxygen is vaporized and warmed against part of the feed air which is compressed in compressor 15 and divided into a first sub stream 20 at 56.4 bars A and a second sub stream 16 at 42 bars A. The first sub stream 20 is cooled against the evaporating oxygen in the heat exchanger 17 . It is then expanded at valve 21 and the largely on a molar basis liquid product is fed to the high pressure column 10 through pipe 22 . The second sub stream is cooled in heat exchanger 17 and is then expanded in generator loaded expander 18 . The cold gas is then used to cool the first sub stream in heat exchanger 17 and is recycled to the compressor 15 .
