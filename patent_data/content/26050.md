# Improvements in or relating to interleavers and de interleavers.

## Abstract
An interleaver is provided which receives a sequence of code words and which distributes the bits of any one code word over a long period of time such that no two bits of the code word are separated by less than a certain time interval. The interleaver is particularly applicable to a tropospheric scatter communication system which suffers from Rayleigh fading. The time interval is selected to minimize the probabil iry that two or more bits of the same code word will be degraded by the same fade. The interleaver is arranged to provide a particularly economical use of data storage capac ity. The interleaver consists of a plurality K 1 of serial shir registers 5 to 11 where each code word contains K bits. Each register has a capacity which is a different integral multiple of a predetermined amount N , and data is temporarily stored in the respective registers for a period of time which is propor tonal to its capacity. Data is routed into and out of the approp riate shift registers by switches 2 and 4.

## Description
ImDrovements in or relating to interleavers This invention relates to interleavers. Interleavers are used, for example, in data transmission systëms in which a number of different data signals are combined in a particular sequence into a single data channel. The present invention is particularly applicable to data which consists of a series of multi bit data words, and which is to be transmitted over a transmission link which is subject to short term fading or distortion. An example of such a transmission link is a tropospheric scatter communication system, which suffers from Rayleigh fading. Although the use of data block codes can enable single errors or sometimes double errors to be corrected, the signal can nevertheless be seriously degraded since the whole of a codeword or a large portion of it may be distorted by a fade cycle.Under these circumstances no signal correction can be provided. It is usual to provide some form of diversity transmission for a troFospheric scatter communication system to reduce the effect of Ravleigh fading In a dual diversity system, signals are transmitted in two distinct forms which are subject to different fading characteristics so as to make it probable that at least one of the signal forms will be received at the far end of the transmission link in a sufficiently uncorrupted form as to permit the original signal to be obtained or reconstituted. It is possible to use a block code in a tropospheric scatter communication without the need to resort to multiple diversities if interleaving is employed. Alternatively interleaving can be used to supplement multiple diversities. The principle of interleaving is to distribute the bits ofs any one code word over a long time period such that no two bits of the code word are separated by less than a certain time interval. This time interval is selected to minimise the probability that two or more bits of the same code word will be caught in z fade. The present invention seeks to provide an interleaver which is suitable for this purpose and which does not require the use of excessive data storage capacity. According to this invention an interleaver includes an input for receiving a stream of data in the form of a sequence of code words, a plurality of data storage means each having a storage capacity which is a different integral multiple of a predetermined amount, means for routing data bits of the stream of data in turn into respective ones of the it storage means, and means for extracting data from the different storage means so that each data bit is stored therein for a period which is proportional to the storage capacity of the data storage means to which it is routed. Preferably the number of data storage means is one less than the number of bits in each code word. Preferably again the storage capacity of the smallest data storage means is zero, i.e. it is constituted by a straight through path. Each of the data storage means can be constituted by serial shift registers, each register having a length which corresponds to the required data storage capmaty. Alternatively and preferably each data storage means is constituted by a random access memory, each data bit being held in a location of the memory until it is required to be read out. The plurality of data storage means is preferably formed of different locations of one or more random access memory devices. If the capacity of individual random access memory devices is not sufficient, a number of separate random access memory devices can be combined, but in general the division between the different data storage means will not be the same as the boundaries between different random access memories. The invention is further described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which, Figure 1 shows diagrammatically in simple form an interleaver and de interleaver connected by a communication link, Figure 2 illustrates in diagrammatic form the organisation of the data storage means and Figure 3 is an explanatory table. Referring to Figure 1, the interleaver illustrated is designed to operate with eight bit code words. The interleaver comprises an input terminal 1 and a routing switch 2, which routes data bit byrbit to a number of different data storage paths. Eight storage paths are illustrated with path 3 being merely a straight forward path between the switch 2 and a further output switch 4. The remaining paths comprise data stores 5 to 11 in the form of serial shift registers. Data store 5 has a capacity of N bits and the capacities of the remaining data stores are progressively increasing integral multiples of N up to 7 N bits. The two switches 2 and 4 are switched from position to position at the bit rate of the code words and the data in a shift register is clocked on by one bit only when that register is selected. In describing the operation of the interleaver, it is assumed that N is 2, although as will be seen subsequently the value of N is likely to be very large in practice. In order to identify the individual bits in successive code words, the bits of a code word are labelled with the lettersA through to H, with à subscript attached to each to identify the code word from which it came, e.g. C5 is the third bit of the fifth code word. Assume that the interleaver has been working for some time, and that the first code word examined is identified by the subscript 1. Bits of previous code words will have lower numbered suffixes, and of later code words higher numbered ones. Thus the input data can be represented by the symbol sequence A 1 B 1 ... H 1 Ao ... Ho A1 B1 C1 .. H1 A2 B2 ... H2 A3 The switches are arranged so that they are in position 1 zero delay synchronously with the A bit in each code word.Examination of Figure 1 shows that the output symbol sequence present at switch w will be, starting with bit A1 A1 B 1 C 3 D 5 E 7 F 9 G 11 H 13 A2 B0 C 2 D 4 E 6 F 8 G 10 H 12 since N 2. Thus the interleaving operation has preserved the code word order of the bits, but has distributed the bits in time so that no two bits of any input code word are separated by less than 16 bits in the output sequence. Here the interleaving time is thus equivalent to 16 bits. The operation of the de interleaver 12 follows from the previous explanation and is the converse of the interleaver operation. If the switches 13 and 14 are synchronised with switches 2 and 4, each bit will effectively be delayed by a fourteen bit period and the output order at terminal 15 will be exactly the same as the input order at terminal 1. It will be appreciated that two successive words of the interleaved output bit stream present on the data link 16 could be completely corrupted, but in the de interleaved stream provided at terminal 15 only one error would result in each of the sixteen successive code words. Thus the effect of the interleaver is to convert error bursts into time dispersed errors. A suitably organised block code can correct errors of this kind. The particular organisation of the inter leaver illustrated in Figure 1 has the property of requiring the minimum possible amount of storage, since each bit is stored only until it has to be transmitted. However, it may not always be practicable to provide the storage capacity in the form of shift registers, since the lengths of the longer shift register would be very long indeed. In a tropospheric scatter communication system, the interleaver is, typically required to provide an interleaving delay of approximately 24 miliseconds and to work at data bit rates of between 512 and 4224 thousand bits per second.With reference to Figure 1, it will be seen that one bit of storage in each shift register will result in eight bits delay in the output bit stream. Thus for 24 mSec interleaving delay at 512 kB s, the storage required in the shortest shift register 5 is N 512 x 103 x 24 x 10 3 bits 8 1536 bits.Thus the total storage needed is N j 2 3 ..... 7 N .7.8 2 28N 43,008 bits. For the highest speedof 4224 kB sec., the value of N is given by N 4224 x 103 x 24 x 10 8 12672 bits and te total storage for the seven shift registers needed is 354,816 bits. With such a large storage capacity requirement, the use of shift register may not always be desirable. Fen the interleaver is required to operate over a wide range of different speeds, it may not be compatible with the available discrete lengths of shift registers which are readily obtainable.Secondly, the use of very long shift registers is not at present the most economical storage method. An alternative structure relating to the specific bit rate of 512 kB sec and wh does not require the use of serial shift registers is illustrated in Figure 2. The arrangement is functionally similar to that illustrated in Figure 1. Referring to Figure 2, random access memories are used in which each is arranged as a 128 row by 128 column array.Memories having storage capacities of greater or less than this can be used as desired. The divison of the total memory array into 128 column blocks is shown by dotted lines. In this large array any one of the total of 768 columns can be selected by a ten bit column address. The effective column addresses in the total array are indicated beside the 128 column divisions. The memory array is now divided notionally into groups.Each group is associated with one of the required delays. The smallest group contains 24 columns and is denoted G1. The other groups, denoted G2 to G7, contain 24 x 2, 24 x 3, etc., columns. The groups are distinguished by their size i.e.number of columns and their base address i.e. column address in the 768 column memory array. The groups are indicated by the solid double line divisions in Figure 2.The size and base addresses of the groups are given in the table shown in Figure 3. Each of the groups G1 to G7 is treated in the same way as the shift registers in Figure 1 in that received data bits in a sequence of block codes are routed sequentially into the memory areas represented by these groups. The data bits are held in the memory for a time period which is proportional to the size of the group in which it is stored they are then read out and combined in the required output sequence. The construction and mode of operation of the de interleaver may be identical to that of the interleaver, but with the switching sequence arranged so that the total time for which any given bit is stored in both the interleaver and the de interleaver is a constant. It is necessary for the switching sequence in the de interleaver to be synchronised with that of the interleaver for the original data words to be properly reconstituted. Unless correct synchronisation is obtained the error rate for the reconstituted data words will be extremely high, and in principle synchronisation can be achieved by stepping the switching sequence of the deinterleaver relative to that of the interleaver forwards or backwards by one bit period at a time until a minimum error rate results.
