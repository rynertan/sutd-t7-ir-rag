## Description
The present invention relates to a step motor which is adapted to maintain various mechanical stable states, to freely control for switching between such mechanical stable positions in an electric manner, or to a positioning mechanism such as valve rod, XY plotter or the like. Conventionally, various step motors such as a variable reluctance type, a permanent magnet rotor type, a hybrid permanent magnet type have been developed according to various operation principles. Particularly, the hybrid permanent magnet type hereinafter, referred to simply HPM has been commonly used. First of all, referring to Fig. 7, a conventional HPM type step motor in a linear motor style will be described. Magnetic stationary members 1 and 51 are magnetically and mechanically connected each other through means not shown. A series of magnetic poles 1a, 1b,1c,1d ... is formed in the magnetic stationary member 1 and another series of magnetic poles 51a, 51b, 51c, 51d, ... is also formed in the magnetic stationary member 51, respectively. The stationary members 1 and 51 are energized as an energizing coil, not shown, to which is applied a voltage. A pair of magnetic movable members 4 and 14 is secured to the both magnetic poles of a permanent magnet 5. The series of magnetic poles 4a,4b,4c, ... is arranged at the magnetic movable member 4 and the series of magnetic poles 14a, 14b, 14c, ... is arranged at the magnetic movable member 14, respectively. Under the condition that the arrangement between the stationary magnetic pole series 1a, ... and series 51a, ... of the stationary members 1 and 51 and the movable magnetic pole series 4a, ... and series 14a, ... of the movbale members 4 and 14 are maintained as shown in Fig. 7, the stationary pole series 1b, 1d, ... and the movable pole series 51b, 51d ... are energized by applying voltage to the energizing coil, not shown. The magnetic flux 23 represented by the solid line arrows shown in the drawing is generated. On the other hand, the magnetic flux 24 represented by the dotted line arrows is generated by the permanent magnet 5 and thus the movable unit of the magnetic movable members 4 and 14 and the permanent magnet 5 are subjected to a urging force in the direction represented by the arrow 20 owing to interaction between these magnetic fluxes. According to this force, the movable unit is moved 1 4 pitch of one tooth of the magnetic pole and then maintained at the stable position where the movable unit is not subjected to the urging force. Succeedingly, as the stationary pole series 1a,1c, ... and 51a, 51c ... are energized, the movable unit is also moved towards and held at the succeeding stable position corresponding the energizing direction in the same manner as the above. The operational principle of a conventional rotary type HPM step motor will be explained in conjunction with Fig.8 a and 8 b . Fig. 8 a is a cross sectional view taken along the line B B in Fig. 8 b , and Fig.8 b is a vertical sectional view taken along the line A A in Fig.8 a , respectively. A series or magnetic poles 1a, 1b, 1c, 1d is arranged at the predetermined regular pitch on the internal surface of a cylindrical magnetic stationary member 1. The poles 1a, 1b, 1c, 1d are respectively provided with electric coils 2a,2b,2c,2d for energizing them. The magnetic stationary member 1 is supported by a bracket 3 made of non magnetic material. The bracket 3 contains a shaft 6 and a bearing 7 so as to pivotably support a rotary unit consisting of magnetic movable members 4 and 14 and a permanent magnet 5. The magnetic movable members 4 and 14 are tightly fixed to both poles of the permanent magnet 5. Magnetizing direction of the permanent magnet 5 is along the longitudinal axis of the shaft 6. The magnetic movable member 4 is provided with a series of poles 4a, 4b,, 4c and the magnetic movable member 14 is also provided with a series of poles 14a, 14b, 14c. These pole series are arranged on the circumferential surface of each magnetic movable members 4 and 14 at predetermined regular pitch. This pitch is not eequivalent to that of the pole series 1a, 1b, 1c, 1d of the magnetic stationary member 1. Further, the pole series 4a, 4b, 4c, 4d is shifted at a half pitch with respect to the pole series 14a, 14b, 14c, 14d. Electric coils 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d are arranged in a multiple phase connection so that each opposite located pair with different phase at 180 As the pair of coils 2a and 2c is energized and the pair of coils 2b and 2d is not energized, the magnetic flux 21 represented by the dotted line arrows in Fig.8 a is generated in the magnetic poles 1a and 1c. Succeedingly, as the pair of coils 2b and 2d is energized and the pair of coils 2a and 2c is not, magnetic flux is also generated in the magnetic poles 1b and 1d. This is so called hetero polar magnetic flux. On the other hand, the permanent magnet 5 generates magnetic flux 22 in so called uni polar shape as represented by the dotted line arrows in Fig. 8 b , so that this uni polar magnetic flux 22 and the hetero polar magnetic flux 21 are synthesized whenever either the coils pair 2a, 2b or the pair 2c, 2d is energized. This synthesized magnetic flux generates a torque between the movable members 4 and 14 and the stationary member 1 and thus the movable members 4 and 14 move and stay at a predetermined stable position. As mentioned above, conventional HPM type step motor has been so designed that every magnetic pole 1a, ..., 51a, ... arranged at the magnetic stationary members 1 and 51 is not energized while the energizing voltage is applied. In other words, one of phase numbers is only energized. As a result, this conventional step motor needs a relative great value of ampere turns for driving the movable member and a complicated constitution. The British Patent Specification GB A 1 556 404 discloses further a stepping motor having a rotor wheel comprising a great number of teeth. Two pole shoes are provided equally spaced, the teeth of one pole shoe being circumferentially offset relative to the teeth of the other shoe by one half tooth pitch. The different pole windings for each step of the motor are either excited in one direction or in the contrary direction, or remain unexcited. Furthermore, in this document, the number of stator poles is ten while the number of rotor poles varies from 28 to 24, 18, 16, 14 and 12, the first and the second pitches being both even. With the previously mentionned problems in mind, it is an an object of the present invention to provide a high characteristics step motor which is improved by decreasing the value of ampere turns for driving, reducing the scale of structure and weight. To resolve the above problems and achieve the above object, the step motor according to the present invention is characterized as follows. According to the present invention, the step motor comprises magnetic stationary members 1, 11 containing a plurality of series of magnetic poles 1a, 1b, ..., 11a,11b, ... arranged at a predetermined regular pitch a magnetic movable member 4 containing a plurality of series of magnetic poles 4a, 4b, ..., 41a, 41b,... arranged at a predetermined regular pitch different from the magnetic pole series 1a, 1b, ..., 11a, 11b, ... , each magnetic pole series having a magnetic surface opposing to the magnetic surface of each the pole series 1a, 1b, ... , 11a, 11b, ... through a gap 31 a permanent magnet 5 containing a first magnetic pole face fixed to either the magnetic stationary member 1, 11 or the magnetic movable member 4 , a second magnetic pole face which is arranged in opposite to the magnetic movable member 4 through a second gap 32 , so as to apply magnetomotive force to a magnetic circuit in parallel connection defined by the magnetic pole series 1a, 1b, ..., 11a, 11b, ... and the other magnetic pole series 4a, 4b, ..., 41a, 41b, ... opposite each other electric coils 2a, 2b, ... which are so wound as to energize one magnetic pole, which belongs to one of the groups including a predetermined number of poles among the magnetic poles 1a, 1b, ..., 11a, 11b, ..., 4a, 4b, ..., 41a, 41b, ... defining the magnetic circuit in parallel connection, in the same direction, as the magnetomotive force generated by the permanent magnet 5 and energize the other magnetic poles in the counter direction of the magnetomotive force and means 6, 7 for mechanically displacing the magnetic movable member 4 with respect to the magnetic stationary members 1, 11 . The present invention constituted as above described provides following effects and advantages. Hereinbelow, the present invention will be described in detail according to the embodiments with referring to the accompanying drawings. Figs. 1 a , b , c , d are schematic illustrations showing a rotary electric motor which is a first embodiment according to the present invention. As shown in Fig. 1 d which is a sectional view taken along the line A A in Fig. 1 a , a permanent magnet 5 one magnetic face of which is fixed to a stationary member 1 applies direct current magnetic flux to a gap 8 radially in the circumferential direction. A movable member 4 is rotatably supported by a shaft 6, a bearing 7 and a non magnetic member 10 with respect to the stationary member 1. The movable member 4 made of a magnetic material contains two first magnetic poles 4a, 4b arranged at the regular interval by two pitches as a first pitch, and also the stationary member 1 made of a magnetic material contains three second magnetic poles 1a, 1b, 1c arranged at the same interval by three pitches as a second pitch. They are so arranged oppositely each other through the gap 8 so as to allow the movable member 4 to displace mechanically with resepect to the stationary member 1. That is , the first magnetic poles of the movable member 4 are shifted at 180 The stationary member 1 is provided with electric coils 2a, 2b, 2c for energizing the second magnetic poles 1a, 1b, 1c. Further, although the permanent magnet 5 is fixed to the stationary member 1, it may be fixed to the movable member 4. Operation of this embodiment will now be explained. When the movable member 4 and the stationary member 1 are maintained in the first mechanical stable position as shown in Fig. 1 a where magnetic reluctance against the magnetomotive force by the permanent magnet 5 has the minimum value, the electric coils 2a, 2b, 2c are applied to electric current flowing in the direction as shown in the figure. The movable member 4 rotates clockwise in Fig. 1 a and stops at the position shown in Fig. 1 b which is the second mechanical stable position. After interruption of the electric current, the movable member is maintained at this position. Under the condition shown in Fig. 1 b , when the electric coils 2a, 2b, 2c are applied with electric current in the direction shown in Fig. 1 b , the movable member 4 also rotates and arrives at the position shown in Fig. 1 c i.e., the third mechanical stable position. Succeedingly, when the electric coils 2a, 2b, 2c are energized with electric current in the direction shown in Fig. 1 c , the movable member 4 rotates in the same manner as above and returns to the first mechanical stable position shown in Fig. 1 a . According to this manner, reversible control can be obtained to shift the movable member 4 into one of the three mechanical stable positions by changing the polarity of the electric pulse applied to the electric coils 2a, 2b, 2c, However, the case that even number of the first pitch of the movable member 4 divided by odd number of the second pitch of the stationary member 1 results in integer, is omitted. Further, odd number of the second pitch of the stationary member 1 should be three or more, so that one should be omitted from the odd numbers. For example, the case that the first pitch is six and the second pitch is three, is omitted since six divided by three results in an integer. This is explained by the reason that if the above condition is established, the magnetic poles of the movable member and the stationary member are fallen in neutral state where forces are balanced and thus they are not driven at all. Also, it is needless to explain for that the present invention can not be established when the pitch number of the stationary member is one. These facts will be valid in the following second embodiment. Referring to Fig. 2 a , b , c , d , there is shown a linear motor wherein a second embodiment according to the present invention is embodied. A movable member 4 made of a magnetic material contains a series of magnetic poles 4a, 4b, 4c, 4d, ... arranged at a regular pitch in a linear formation like teeth shape. A stationary member 1 contains three magnetic poles 1a, 1b, 1c arranged at 2 3 pitch of the above pitch of the movable member 4. This series of magnetic poles 1a, 1b, 1c faces the series of poles 4a, 4b, 4c, 4d ... of the movable member 4 through a gap 8. The movable member 4 can be mechanically moved with respect to the stationary member 1 in a lineary parallel direction. The magnetic poles 1a, 1b, 1c of the stationary member 1 are further provided with electric coils 2a, 2b, 2c 2d respectively so as to energize the magnetic poles 1a, 1b, 1c. A permanent magnet, not shown in the drawing, is fixed to either the stationary member 1 or the movable member 4 so that direct current magnetic flux 18 is generated. An operation of this embodiment will now be explained. As shown in Fig. 2 a , the movable member 4 is located in a first mechanical stable position which is one of the positions at which magnetic reluctance against the, magnetomotive force generated by the permanent magnet is the minimum. Under this condition, when the electric coils 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d are energized with electric current flowing in the direction shown in Fig. 2 b , magnetic flux 19 generated by these coils 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d is cancelled by the magnetic flux generated by the permanent magnet at the magnetic poles 4a, 4b, on the other hand, these magnetic fluxes are synthesized at the magnetic pole 4c. As a result, the movable member 4 is shifted into the position shown in Fig. 2 b and is stable with respect to the stationary member 1. Even when the electric current is interrupted, the second mechanical stable state shown in Fig. 2 b is maintained. In the same manner as the above, the movable member 4 is shifted from the second stable position shown in Fig. 2 b to the third stable position shown in Fig. 2 c by applying the electric current as shown in Fig. 2 c , and succeedingly shifted from the third stable position shown in Fig. 2 c to the position shown in Fig. 2 d corresponding to the first stable position shown in Fig. 2 a by applying the electric current as shown in Fig. 2 d . As a result, reversible control is obtained to shift or keep the movable member 4 among various mechanical stable positions by changing the polarity of the current or turning on off the current applied to the electric coils 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d for energizing the stationary member 1. It is needless to mention that the pitch numbers of the first and second embodiment according to the present invention is not limited. Referring to Fig. 3, there is shown a linear motor wherein a third embodiment according to the present invention is illustrated. A series of magnetic poles 1a, 1b, 1c, ..., is arranged on a magnetic stationary member 1 at a regular pitch and energized as electric current is applied to electric coil, not shown in the figure. Another magnetic stationary member 11 is magnetically and mechanically connected to the former magnetic stationary member 1 through means not shown. The N polarity magnetic face of a permanent magnet 5 is tightly fixed to the magnetic stationary member 11. A series of magnetic poles 4a, 4b, 4c, 4d,... is arranged on a magnetic movable member 4 at a predetermined pitch different from that of the magnetic poles 1a, 1b, 1c ...,. These magnetic poles 4a, 4b, 4c, 4d,... face to the magnetic poles 1a, 1b, 1c through a first gap 31 so as to form a magnetic circuit in parallel connection. The permanent magnet 5 applies magnetomotive force to this magnetic circuit in parallel connection. On the other hand, the magnetic movable member 4 faces to the S polarity surface of the permanent magnet 5 through a second gap 32. The magnetic poles constituting this magnetic circuit in parallel connection are selectively classified into required groups. Electric coils not shown are so arranged that any one of the magnetic poles belonging to the group is energized in the same direction than the magnetomotive force generated by the permanent magnet 5 and the other magnetic poles of the group are energized in the counter direction than the magnetomotive force. In other words, when the magnetic poles 1a, 1b, 1c, ... of the magnetic stationary member 1 and the magnetic poles 4a, 4b, 4c, 4d,... of the magnetic movable member 4 are located in the position shown in the figure, only the magnetic pole 1b is energized in the same direction than the magnetic flux 24 generated by the permanent magnet 5 and the other poles 1a, 1c are energized in the counter direction than the magnetic flux 24 so as to generate the magnetic flux 23 represented by the solid line arrow. This magnetic flux 23 interacts with the magnetic flux 24 represented by the dotted line arrow generated by the permanent magnet 5, so that the magnetic movable member 4 is subjected to the urging force in the direction represented by the arrow 20 and thus the movable member 4 shifts 1 4 pitch and stops in the new stable position where the urging force is not applied. Succeedingly, when only one of the magnetic poles 1a, 1b, 1c,... is energized in the same direction than the magnetic flux 24 generated by the permanent magnet 5 and the other poles are energized in the counter direction of that, the magnetic movable member 4 shifts to succeeding stable positions according to this energization. As mentioned above, all the magnetic poles 1a, 1b, 1c, ... of the stationary member of this embodiment are energized simultaneously when electric current is applied. This is distinct from the conventional devices. Referring to Fig. 4, there is shown a linear motor wherein a fourth embodiment according to the present invention is embodied. This linear motor comprises magnetic poles series 4a, 4b, ..., 4a, 4b, ..., 1a, 1b, ..., 1a, 1b, .... This embodiment is operated in the same manner as the embodiment shown in Figs. 6 a , b which will be referred to later. In order to establish the driving direction, the first gap 31 defined between the magnetic pole series 1a,... of the magnetic stationary member 1 and the magnetic pole series 4a,... of the magnetic movable member 4 is intentionally provided with an irregularity, or a shading coil is arranged on either the magnetic pole series 1a, ... of the magnetic stationary member 1 or the magnetic pole series 4a,... of the magnetic movable member 4 in the same way as in the conventional permanent magnet type step single phase motor. Although the permanent magnet 5 is disposed at the magnetic stationary members 1, 11 in all the above mentioned embodiments, it may also be arranged on the magnetic movable member 4. Referring to Figs. 5 a , b , there is shown a rotary type step motor wherein the fifth embodiment according to the present invention is embodied. Fig. 5 a is a sectional view taken along the line B B in Fig. 5 b , and Fig. 5 b is also a sectional view taken along the line A A in Fig. 5 a , respectively. A plurality of magnetic poles 1a, 1b, 1c is arranged on the inner surface of a cylindrical magnetic stationary member 1 at a predetermined regular pitch. On the other hand, a plurality of magnetic poles 4a, 4b, 4c, 4d is arranged on the circumferential edge of a magnetic movable member 4 at a predetermined pitch different from the former pitch of the poles 1a, 1b, 1c. The magnetic poles 1a, 1b, 1c face to the magnetic poles 4a, 4b, 4c 4d through a first gap 31 so as to form a magnetic circuit in a parallel connection. The N polarity surface of a permanent magnet 5 is tightly fixed to a magnetic bracket 3 and the S polarity surface faces to the magnetic movable member 4 through a second gap 32 so as to magnetize in the direction of the axis of a shaft 6. According to this arrangement, the permanent magnets 5 applies magnetomotive force to the magnetic circuit in parallel connection. The magnetic poles of the stationary member constituting the magnetic circuit in parallel connection are selectively classified into required groups. Electric coils 2a, 2b, 2c are arranged to energize the magnetic poles 1a, 1b, 1c respectively and so arranged that one of the magnetic poles belonging to the group is energized in the same direction than the magnetomotive force generated by the permanent magnet 5. And the other magnetic poles of the group are energized in the counter direction of the magnetomotive force. A magnetic bracket 3 is connected to the magnetic stationary member 1 and pivotally supports the magnetic movable member 4 as a rotary member in combination with a non magnetic member 34, a shaft 6 and a bearing 7. This embodiment operates in the same manner as the embodiment as shown in Fig. 1. Referring to Figs. 6 a and b , there is shown a sixth embodiment according to the present invention. Fig. 6 a is a sectional view taken along the line B B in Fig. 6 b , and Fig. 6 b is also a sectional view taken along the line A A in Fig. 6 a . Magnetic poles 4a, 4b, ... and 41a, 41b, ... are disposed at both side surfaces of a cylindrical magnetic movable member 4 at right angle to an axial direction of a shaft 6. These magnetic poles are arranged at a predetermined regular pitch along the circumference of the cylindrical magnetic movable member 4. Further, the pitch of the magnetic poles 4a, 4b, ... is shifted a half pitch with respect to the magnetic poles 41a, 41b ... . A magnetic bracket 3 is connected to a magnetic stationary member 1 and pivotably supports the magnetic movable member 4 as a rotary member in combination with a non magnetic member 34, a shaft 6 and a bearing 7. The magnetic bracket 3 is provided with a series of magnetic poles 1a, 1b, ..., and another series of magnetic poles 11a, 11b, ..., at a predetermined regular pitch different from the pitch of the pole series 4a, 4b, ..., and 41a, 41b, ... at both side surfaces of the magnetic movable member 4. These pole series 1a, 1b, ... and 11a, 11b, ... face to the pole series 4a, 4b, ..., and 41a, 41b, ..., at both side surfaces of the movable member 4 through first gaps 31 so as to define a magnetic circuit in parallel connections, respectively. A permanent magnet 5 in a cylindrical shape is arranged along the inner circumferential surface of the magnetic stationary member 1 in order to apply the magnetomotive force to the magnetic circuits in parallel connection. An electric coil 2a is arranged to energize the magnetic poles 1a, 1b, 1c, 11a, 11b, and 11c. This electric coil 2a is energized with electric current so as to energize one of the magnetic circuit in the first gap 31 formed by one of the magnetic poles 1a, 1b, ..., 11a, 11b, ..., and one of the magnetic poles 4a, 4b,..., 41a, 41b, ..., in the same direction than the magnetomotive force generated by the permanent magnet 5, and the other magnetic circuits in the first gap 31 in the counter direction with the polarity shown in the drawing. The permanent magnet 5 faces the magnetic movable member 4 through a second gap 32. As a result, a magnetic flux 23 represented by the dotted line is generated when the electric coil 2a is energized and synthesized with the magnetic flux 24a and 24b generated by the permanent magnet 5. That is to say, the magnetic flux 23 is flowing in the same direction than the partial magnetic flux 24a and in the counter direction of the other partial magnetic flux 24b, this synthesized magnetic flux applies a torque to the magnetic movable member 4. The present invention is adapted to maintain various mechanical stable states, to freely control for switching between each mechanical stable positions in an electric manner, or to a positioning mechanism such as a valve rod, XY plotter or the like.
