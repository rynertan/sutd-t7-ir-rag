# Auto tuned frequency discriminator.

## Abstract
An integrable auto tuned frequency discriminator is provided having a feedback circuit 13 to tune the discrimi nator when an input signal having a reference frequency is applied to the input of the frequency discriminator. The input signal is multiplied by a delayed version thereof which is provided by a delay filter 11 . The length of delay is varied by altering the transfer function of the delay filter in response to delay filter control inputs. The discriminator output is coupled to a feedback circuit which generates the control input signals, thereby tuning the delay filter to provide a discriminator output reference level. A control input 18 to the feedback circuit provides the capability to tune the delay filter to a carrier frequency which is offset from the reference frequency. A gate input 19 to the feedback circuit disables the feedback input after the frequency discriminator has been tuned.
