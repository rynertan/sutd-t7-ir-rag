# A METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR THE DETECTION OF IMPURITIES IN A LIQUID SUCH AS BLOOD

## Abstract
A method and apparatus are disclosed for detecting impurities in a liquid such as blood. A minimum amount of ultrasound Doppler radiation of narrow bandwidth to maxi mize sensitivity is directed through a transducer focused in the far field and positioned at an angle with respect to a flow of liquid, such as blood, to be monitored. The reflected radiation received at the transducer, due to backscattering agents in the liquid, is used to generate a backscatter power signal the level of which is dependent upon the scattering agents in the liquid. This signal is utilized to determined the presence of impurities in the liquid, which in the case of carbon particles in blood, provide a higher average power level than the scattering agents in pure blood.
