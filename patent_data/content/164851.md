## Abstract
The present invention provides a device for mixing at least two fluids to produce a homogenous mixture characterized in that there is an inlet adapted for receipt of at least two fluids, a receiving chamber having an outlet, cavity means located within said chamber and having an opening in fluid communication therewith, and conduit means located within said cavity means and coupled to said inlet for receipt of said two fluids, said conduit means including stream producing means for producing at least two streams of said liquid, said streams being directed into said cavity means in at least two directions to effect a mixing action of said liquids, whereupon said mixed liquid overflows said cavity means out of said opening and into said receiving cavity for egress from said apparatus via said outlet.
