More particularly, this invention is concernec with anido and hydrazido derivatives of N phosphinothioyl.nethylglycine esters wherein anido or hydrazico groups are bonded to the phosphorus atom in addition to a divalent sulfur atom. This class of compounds has been found to display desirable herbicidal activity when applied to certain varieties of weeds or undesired plants. U.S. Patent No. 3,799,758 describes the preparation of N phosphonomethylglycine and certain of its esters, amides and salts. Also described is the use of such compounds as contact or post emergent herbicides. Biomedical Mass Spectrometry, Vol. 3, 1976 pages 29.31 describes the tributyl ester derivatives ofN trifluoroacetyl N phosphonomethylglycine. It will be apparent from a study of the above patents and publication that none of them disclose or suggest anido or hydrazido N phosphonomethylglycine esters containing a P S grouping. The compounds of the present invention are represented by the formulaEMI1.1 wherein R is a member of the class consisting of alkyl of from 1 to carbon atoms, chloroalkyl of fro 1 to 4 carbon atoms and from 1 to 3 chlorine atoms and alkoxyalkyl containing from 3 to 7 carbon atoms and wherein is a member of t class consisting ofEMI1.2 wherein each R is individually selected from the class consisting of hydrogen, C1 C alkyl, C2 C4 alkenyl, C3 C7 cycloalkyl, benzyl or phenyl a heterocyclic group selected fro the class consisting of morpholine, pyrrolidine or piperidine or aEMI2.1 group wherein Z1 is aEMI2.2 group wherein R is hydrogen, C1 C4 alkyl or phenyl a neterocyclic group selected from the class consisting of piperidine, pyrrolidine and morpholine. It is preferred that R be alkyl or chloroalkyl of from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. It is even more preferred that R be methyl or ethyl. It is preferred that Z represent alkylamino or dialkylamino of fro 1 to 4 carbon atons, Illustrati of the alkyl groups represented by are ethyl, ethyl, n and isopropyl, n , sc, iso and tert butyl, pentyl, hexyl and octyl.The choroalkyl groups that R represents are, for example, chloromethyl, chloroethyl, chloropropyl, trichloropropyl, chlorobutyl and the like. Illustrative of the alkoxyalkyl groups which R represents are methoxyethyl, methoxypropyl, methoxybutyl, ethoxyethyl, ethoxypropyl, propoxyethyl, propoxypropyl and the like. Illustrative of the alkyl groups represented by P and R are methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, isobutyl and the like. Illustrative of the alkoxyalkyl groups represented by R are vinyl, allyl, butenyl and the lie. Illustrative of the cycloalkyl groups represented by R are, for example, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl and cycloheptyl. In accordance with the present invention, the compounds of formula I are prepared by reacting a compound of the formulaEMI3.1 wherein R and Z are as above defined with sodium tetrahydridoboron in the presence of an aprotic solvent at G temperature of from 0 C. to about 50 C. The above reaction is generally conducted at temperatures of from 0 C. to ambient temperature.However, temperatures in the range of from 0 C. to 50 C.can be employed. Temperatures of fro 0 C. to 25 C. are preferred for convenience. The starting materials employed in the preparation of the compounds of this invention are prepared by reacting e compound of the formulaEMI3.2 wherein R is as above defined with an gamine or hydrazine of the formulaEMI3.3 wherein Z and 11 are as above defined .n the presence of a hydrogen lid acceptor and then treating the reaction mixture with at least an equivalent amount of elemental sulfur. The above reaction is generally conductec at ambient temperature. however, temperatures in the ran J of from 0 C. to 50 C. can be employed. Ambient temperatures of from 150C. to 250C. are preferred for convenience. If it is desired to produce compounds of formula 1 wherein each Z is different, it is necessary to perform sequential steps in animation or hydrazination with the hydrogen halide acceptor. In each instance, one equivalent of the compound of the formulaEMI4.1 wherein Z and Z1 are as above defined is added at each step. It is, of course, apparent to those skilled in the art that for each chloro group in the compounds of formula III , one should employ at least one equivalent of the amine or hydrazine together with at least an equivalent amount of the hydrogen halide acceptor. Inasmuch as the dichlorophosphinyl compounds of formula III are unstable towards moisture, the reaction, for best results, must be conducted in an anhydrous environment, that is, anhydrous reagents and solvents should be employed. Although the reaction can be conducted in a stepwise manner, i.e., by isolating the dichloro compound of formula III and then conducting the amination and then subsequent conversion to the thioyl derivative, it is preferred for convenience to conduct the total reaction in a single reaction vessel without complete isolation ana icentification of the dichlorophosphinic compound. The starting compounds of formula III employed in the production of the compounds of the invention are prepared by the following general procedure. An ester of M hydroxyphosphinylmethylglycine is dissolved in trifluoroacetic acid and an equal solar quantity or slight excess of trifluoroacetic anhydride is added dropwise with stirring at ambient temperature. Too large an excess of anhydride should b avoided to obtaiel the best yields of the compound. The reaction mixture is then concentrated in vacuo to yield the ester of N trifluoroacetyl N hydroxyphosphinylmethyl glycine. The ester of N trifluoroacetyl N hydroxyphos phinylmethyl glycine is then converted to the ester ofN trifluoroacetyl N bis chloro phosphonomethyl glycine by dissolving in benzene and thzn adding to excess phosphorus trichioride at ambient temperature. The phosphine dichloride is recovered by filtration and then concentration of the filtrate in vacuo. The dichloro phosphine compound is extremely sensitive to moisture. It is, therefore, desirable and necessary to employ anhydrous reagents and aprotic solvents while protecting the reaction mixture fron moisture to obtain the best yields. The conpounds of this invention are useful as herbicides. The following examples serve to further illustrate the invention.

In certain specific instances, however, some selectivity is demonstrated.In this regard it should be recognized that each individual species selected for the above tests is a representative member of a recognized family of plait species. Fron Table III, it can be seen that the pre emergent herbicidal activity demonstrated son2 selectivity. The herbicidal compositions, including concentrates which require dilution prior to application to the plants, of this invention contain froa 5 to 95 parts by weight of at least one compound of this invention and from 5 to 95 parts by weight of an ajuvent in liquid or solid form, for example, from about Q.25 to 25 parts by weight of wetting agent, from about 0.25 to 25 parts by weight of a dispersant and from 4.5 to about 94.5 parts by weight of inert liquid extender. e.q., water, acetone, tetrahydrofuran, ali parts being by weight of the total composition. Preferably, the compositions of this invention contain from 5 to 75 parts by weight of at least one compound of this invention, tocjethtr with the adjuvants. here required, from about 0.1 to 2.0 parts by weigh of the inert liquid extender can be replaced by a corrosion inhibitor such as ethanol mercaptan, sodium thiosulfate, dodecylmono or dimercaptan or anti foaming agent such as a dimethylpolysiloxane, or both.The compositions are prepared by admixing the active ingredient with an adjuvant including diluents, extenders, carriers and conditioning agents to provide compositions in the form of finely divided particulate solids, pellets, solutions, dispersions or emulsions. Tnus, the active ingredient can be used with an adjutant such as a finely divided solid, a liquid of organic origin, water, e wetting agent, a dispersing agent, an emulsifying agent or any suitable combination of these. The herbicidal compositions of this invention, particularly liquids and soluble powders, preferably contain as a conditioning agent one or norse surface active agents in amounts sufficient to render a given composition readily dispersible in water or in oil. The incorpo ration of a surface active agent into the compositions greatly enhances their efficacy. By the term surface active agent , it is understood that wetting agents, dispersing agents, suspending agents and emulsifying agents are included therein. Anionic, cationic and nonionic agents can be used with equal facility. Preferred wetting agents are alkyl benzene and alkyl naphthalene sulfonates, sulfated fatty alcohols, amines or acid amides, long chain acid esters of sodium isothionate, esters of sodium sulfosuccinate, sulfated or sulfonated fatty acid esters petroleum sulfonates, sulfonated vegetable oils, polyoxyethylene derivatives of phenols and alkylphenols particularly isooctylphenol and nonylphenol and polyoxyethylene derivatives of the mono higher fatty acid esters of hexitol anhydrides e.g sorbitan . preferred dispersants ar methyl cellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, sodium lignin, sulfonates, polymeric alkyl naphthalene sulfonates, sodium naphthalene sulfonate, polymethylene bisnaphthalenesulfonate and sodium N methyl N long chain acid taurates.

The application of liquid and particulate solid compositions to plants or soil can be carried out by conventional methods, e.g., power dusters, boom and hand sprayers anici spray dusters,The compositions can also b applied fron airplanes as a dust or a spray because of their effectiveness at low dosages. The application of herbicidal compositions to aquatic plants is usually carried out by adding the compositions to the aquatic media in the area where control of the aquatic plants is desired. The application of an effective amount of th compounds or compositions of this invention to the plant is essential and critical for the practice of the present invention. The exact amount of active ingredient to be employed is dependent upon the response desired in the plant as ell as such other factors as the plant species and stage of development thereof, and the amount of rainfall as well as the specific glycine enployed. In foliar treatment for the control of vegetative growth, the active ingredients are applied in amounts fron about 0.112 to about 56.0 or nore kilograns per hectare.In pre emergent treatments, the rate of application can be from about 0.56 to about 22.4 or more kilograms per hectare. In applications for the control of aquatic plants, the active ingredients are applied in amounts of fron about O.O1 parts per million to about 1000 parts per million, based on the aquatic medium. An effective amount for phytotoxic or herbicidal control is that amount necessary for overall or selective control, i.e., a phytotoxic or herbicidal amount. It is believed that one skilled in the art can readily determine from the teachings of this specification, including examples, the approximate application rate.
