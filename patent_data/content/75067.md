# Variable energy absorbing system for crashworthy helicopter seats.

## Abstract
An improved crashworthy helicopter seat primarily for combat aircraft includes at least upper 20 , intermediate 22 and lower 24 pairs of energy absorbers attached be tween the seat bucket 12 and the frame of the aircraft and operable in both tension and compression. The energy ab sorbers comprise a plurality of telescoped tubes interfitted into one another and having coils of wire frictionally engaged between adjoining tubes such that energy is dis sipated by motion of the tubes relative to one another through the plastic deformation of the coils of wire. The energy absorbers are adjustable to optimize safety par ameters of occupants of the seat under a range of potential crash conditions including the most probable crash con dition, for occupants having a substantial range of weight and size. Adjustability of the energy absorbers is accom plished by intermediate electromechanical apparatus 42 which is responsive to the girth of the occupant of the seat as determined by the extension of an adjustable lap belt 26 fastened around the torso of the occupant of the seat.
