## Abstract
A method of displaying a ladder diagram in a numerical control system for displaying a sequence program on a display device in the form of a ladder diagram using at least relay contact symbols and relay symbols. The method includes steps of forming each item of data in the sequence program of an instruction code and operand, storing in memory correspondence between the operand and a condi tion corresponding to the operand belonging to each item of data, converting the sequence program into picture informa tion for displaying a ladder diagram, obtaining a condition corresponding to an operand accompanying a write instruc tion from among the instruction codes, converting the name of the condition into picture information, and displaying the ladder diagram on a display device on the basis of the picture information, the ladder diagram display including the name of the condition.
