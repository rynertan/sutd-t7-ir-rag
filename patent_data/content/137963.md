Selected compounds of this invention were tested as herbicides in the following manner. Pre emergence herbicide test. On the day preceding treatment, seeds of eight different weed species are planted in loamy sand soil in individual rows using one species per row across the width of a flat. The seeds used are green foxtail FT Setaria viridis , watergrass WG Echinochloa crusgalli , wild oat WO Avena fatua , annual morningglory AMG Ipanoea lacunosa , velvetleaf VL Abutilon theophrasti , Indian mustard MD Brassica juncea , redroot pigweed PW Amaranthus retroflexus or curly dock CD Rumex crispus , and yellow nutsedge YNG Cyperus esculentus . Ample seeds are planted to give about 20 to 40 seedlings per row, after energence, depending upon the size of the plants. Using an analytical balance, 600 milligrans mg of the canpourd to be tested are weighed out on a piece of glassine weighing paper. The paper and compound are placed in a 60 milliliter ml wide mouth clear bottle and dissolved in 45 ml of acetone or substituted solvent. Eighteen ml of this solution are transferred to a 60 ml wide mouth clear bottle and diluted with 22 ml of a water and acetone mixture 19 1 containing enough polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate emulsifier to give a final solution of 0.5 v v . The solution is then sprayed on a seeded flat on a linear spray table calibrated to deliver 80 gallons per acre 748 L ha . The application rate is 4 Ib acre 4.48 Kg ha . After treatment, the flats are placed in the greenhouse at a temperature of 70 to 80 F and watered by sprinkling. TWO weeks after treatment, the degree of injury or control is determined by comparison with untreated check plants of the same age. The injury rating fran 0 to 100 is recorded for each species as percent control with 0 representing no injury and 100 representing complete control.

Thus, these active herbicidal compounds may be formulated as granules of relatively large particle size, as wettable powders, as emulsifi able concentrates, as popery dusts, as solutions or as any of several other known types of formulations, depending upon the desired mode of application.Preferred formulations for pre energence herbicidal applied tions are wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates and granules. These formulations may contain as little as about 0.5 to as much as about 95 or more by weight of active ingredient. A herbicidally effective anount depends upon the nature of the seeds or plants to be controlled and the rate of application varies fran about 0.05 to approximately 25 pounds per acre, preferably fran about 0.1 to about 10 pounds per acre. Wettable powders are in the form of finely divided Farticles which disperse readily in water or other dispersants. The wettable powder is ultimately applied to the soil either as a dry dust or as a dispersion in water or other liquid. Typical carriers for wettable pokers include fuller s earth, kaolin clays, silicas and other readily vet organic or inorganic diluents. Wettable Folders normally are prepared to contain about 5 to about 95 of the active ingredient and usually also contain a small amount of wetting, dispersing, or emulsifying agent to facilitate wetting and dispersion. Emulsifiable concentrates are hanogeneous liquid compositions which are dispersible in water or other dispersant, and may consist entirely of the active compound with a liquid or solid emulsifying agent, or may also contain a liquid carrier, such as xylene, heavy aromatic naphthal, isophorone and other non volatile organic solvents. Fbr herbicidal application, these concentrates are dispersed in water or other liquid carrier and normally applied as a spray to the area to be treated. The percentage by weight of the essential active ingredient may vary according to the manner in which the composition is to be applied, but in general comprises about 0.5 to 95 of active ingredient by weight of the herbicidal composition. Granular formulations wherein the toxicant is carried on relatively coarse particles, are usually applied without dilution to the area in which suppression of vegetation is desired. Typical carriers for granular formulations include sand, fuller s earth, bentonite clays, vermiculite, perlite and other organic or inorganic materials which absorb or which may be coated with the toxicant. Granular formulations normally are prepared to contain about 5 to about 25 of active ingredients which may include surface active agents such heavy aranatic naphthas, kerosene or other petroleum fractions, or vegetable oils and or stickers such as destrins, glue or synthetic resins. Typical wetting, dispersing or enulsifying agents used in agricultural formulations include, for example, the alkyl and alkyl yl sulfonates and sulfates and their sodium salts polyhydric alcohols and other types of surface active agents, many of which are available in can merce. The surface active agent, when used, normally comprises from 0.1 to 15 by weight of the herbicidal composition. Dusts, which are free flowing admixtures of the active ingredient with finely divided solids such as talc, clays, flours ard other organic and inorganic solids which act as dispersants and carriers for the toxicant, are useful formulations for soil inivorporatirs application. Pastes, which are homogeneous suspensions of a finely divided solid toxicant in a liquid carrier such as water or oil, are employad for specific purposes. The formulations normally contain about 5 to about 95 of active ingredient by weight, and may also contain small anoints of a wetting, dispersing or emulsifying agent to facilitate dispersion. Eór application, the pastes are normally diluted and applied as a spray to the area to be affected. Other useful formulations for herbicidal applications include simple solutions of the active ingredient in a dispersant in which it is completely soluble at the desired concentration, such as acetone, alkylated naphthalenes, xylene ard other organic solvents. Pressurized sprays, typically aerosols, wherein the active ingredient is dispersed in finelydivided form as a result of vaporization of a low boiling dispersant solvent carrier, such as the Ereons, may also be used. The phytotoxic compositions of this invention are applied to the plants in the conventional manner. Thus, the dust and liquid compositions can be applied to the plant by the use of powebdusters, boom and hand sprayers and spray dusters. The compositions can also be applied fran airplanes as a dust or a spray because they are effective in very low dosages. In order to modify or control growth of germinating seeds or emerging seedlings, as a typical exanple, the dust and liquid compositions are applied to the soil according to conventional methods and are distributed in the soil to a depth of at least 1 2 inch below the soil surface. It is not necessary that the phytotoxic compositions be admixed with the soil particles since these compositions can also be applied merely by spraying or sprinkling the surface of the soil. The phytotoxic composi tions of this invention can also be applied by addition to irrigation water supplied to the field to be treated. This method of application permits the penetration of the compositions into the soil as the water is absorbed therein. Dust compositions, granular compositions or liauid formulations applied to the surface of the soil can be distributed below the surface of the soil by conventional means such as discing, dragging or mixing operations. The Eh ytotoxic compositions of this invention can also contain other additanents, for example, fertilizers ard other herbicides, pesticides and the like, used as adjutant or in combination with any of the above described adjuvants. Other phiytotoxic compounds useful in combina tion with the above described compounds include, for example, anilides such as 2 benzothiazole 2 yloxy N methyl acetanilide, 2 chloro 2 ,6 dimethyl N n propylethyl acetanilide, 2 chloro 2 ,6 diethyl N butoxymethyl acetanil ide 2,4 dichlorophenaxyacetic acids, 2,4,5 tr ichlorophen oxyacetic acid, 2 methyl 4 chlorophenoxyacetic acid and the salts, esters and amides thereof triazine derivatives, such as 2,4 bis 3 methoxypropyl amino 6 methylthio s triazine, 2 chloro 4 ethylamino 6 isopropylamino striazine, and 2 ethylamino 4 isopropyl amino 6 methyl mercapto s triazine urea derivatives, such as 3 3, 5 dichlorophenyl l,l dimethylurea and 3 p chlorophenyl l ,l dimethylurea and acetanides such as N,N diallyl alpha chloroacetamide, and the like benzoic acids such as 3 amino 2,5 di chlorobenzoic acid thiocarbamates such as S 1,1 dimethylbenzyl piper de 1 carbothiaote, 3 4 chlorophenyl methyl diethylcarbothioate, ethyl1 hexahydro 1,4 azepine 1 carbothicate, S ethyl hexahydro 1H azepine 1carbothioate, S propyl N,N dipropylthiocarbamate, S ethyl N,N dipropylthiocarbanate, S ethyl cyclohexylethylthioc art,anate, S ethyl hexahydro lHazopine 1 carbothioate and the like anilines such as 4 methylsulfonyl 2,6 dinitro N,N substituted aniline, 4 trifluoromethyl 2,6 dinitro N,N din propyl aniline, 4 trifluoromethyl0 2,6 dinitro N ethyl N butyl aniline, 2 4 2,4 dichlorophenoxy phenoxypropanoic acid, 2 1 ethoxyimino butyl 5 2 ethylthio propyl 3 hydroxy 2 cyclohexene 1 one, butyl 2 4 5 trifluoromethyl 2 pyridinyl oxy phenoxy propenate, sodium 5 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl phenoxy 2 nitrobenzoate, 3 isopropyl 1H2,1,3 benzothiadiazine 4 3H one 2,2 dioxide, and 4 amino 6 tert butyl 3 methlthio s triazin 5 4H one or 4 amino 6 1,1 dimethylethyl 3 methylthio 1,2,4 triazin 5 4H one and S O,iisopropyl benzene sulfonanide. rtilizers useful in canbination with the active ingredients include, for exanple, amonium nitrate, urea and superphosphate. Other useful additaments include materials in which plant organisns take root and grow such as compost, manure, humus, sand, and the like.
