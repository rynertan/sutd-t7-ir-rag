# Resistor element assembly for a heating furnace of glass sheets and method of replacing a resistor element.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a resistor element assembly 20 for a glass sheet heating furnace and to a method of replacing a resistor element 2 . A resistor element 20 is built by plac ing successively in longitudinal direction ceramic elements 2 with a resistance wire 6 wound therearound. Between the ceramic elements 2 are fitted ceramic spacer blocks 4 whose diameter exceeds that of the resistance wire coils 6 . The resistor element 20 is carried by a support frame upon the spacer blocks. A problem to be resolved is to provide a long resistor element 20 , wherein the major variations in length between the components of various materials caused by major temperature variations do not produce deformations in resistance wires 6 . This problem has been resolved by fit ting between one end 26 of the support frame 21 and the corresponding end 28 of the resistor element 20 a ten sioned spring 25 which compresses the resistor element 20 at all operating temperatures against a limit stop at the other end of the support frame. The resistor element can be re placed by releasing said spring 25 from the support frame and by pulling the resistor element 20 out of a furnace by uti lizing a core pin 1 extending through the entire resistor ele ment, whereby the ceramic elements 2 remain subjected to compression stress. By using an auxiliary spring 16 between the end of said core pin 1 and the end of said resistor ele ment, the compression holding the resistor element together can be maintained also during transportation and installation.
