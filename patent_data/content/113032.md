# An apparatus for performing hashing operations using galois field multiplication.

## Abstract
The invention comprises an apparatus for performing a hashng operation on an N bit number under control of a prespecified N bit hashing constant which comprises per forming N K finite field partial multiplications of the object to be hashed by the hashing constant, utilizing K logic and combinatorial circuits FSR1, 10 FSR2, 12.. all of which operate in parallel to completely evalute the function in N K operations. Another feature of the present invention is that the hashing constant loaded into the system may be changed at will with a resultant changing of the hashing characteristics to suit a particular class of objects to be hashed. This is done by a select operation. In the select operation, the hashing constant is sequentially loaded into said K logic and combinatorial circuits, each of which comprises a feedback shift register FSR1,...K , said feedback shift registers being so configured that at the end of K operational sequences each of said feedback shift registers contains said hashing constant shifted and permuted in accordance with the particular feedback configuration of said register, a number of bits proportional to its location in the sequence of feedback shift registers, such that the hashing constant in the shift register FSR
