# Electrodeposition of chromium and its alloys.

## Abstract
A chromium electroplating electrolyte comprising a source of trivalent chromium ions, a complexant, a buffer agent and a sulphur species selected from sulphites and dithionites, the complexant being selected so that the stability constant K₁ of the chromium complex as defined herein is in the range 10⁶ K₁ 10¹² M ¹ preferably the chromium ions have a molar concentration lower than 0.01M. Complexants within this range include aspartic acid, iminodiacetic acid, nitrilotriacetic acid, 5 sulphosalicylic acid and citric acid.
