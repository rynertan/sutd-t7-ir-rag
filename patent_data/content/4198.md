# Dispensing apparatus.

## Abstract
The apparatus dispenses flowable particulate materials from a storage container while isolating the material from unnecessary exposure to ambient atmosphere. For this purpose the apparatus includes a funnel element 58 mounted to receive particulate material from the container. A metering member 60 and a closure 62 are mounted on a common reciprocable rod 134 to provide double isolation of the material from the ambient atmosphere. The metering member portion is adjustable in relation to the funnel element. Particulate material is dispensed when the reciprocable rod is manually moved downwardly a distance sufficient to open the closure. After dispensing the particulate material an activable element 214 is operated to return the bell from its sealing relation, with the funnel element to the same, or new adjusted position, relative to the funnel element.
