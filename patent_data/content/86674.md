# Underwater pipeline sealing apparatus.

## Abstract
Apparatus 22 is disposed within an underwater pipeline 10 for preventing flow of water from a first portion 24 of the pipeline forward of the apparatus to a second portion 26 of the pipeline rearward of the apparatus. At least one wedge shaped member 52 is mounted on a carriage 46 of the appa ratus for grippingly engaged the internal wall 40 of the pipe line 10 for preventing movement of the apparatus 22 in an rearward direction 30 upon application of force to the carriage 46 urging the carriage in the rearward direction 30 in the pipeline 10 . In order to provide frictional contact with the pipeline wall 40 so that gripping engagement thereof may be effected, the member 52 is continually urged into sliding engagement with the pipeline wall 40 during movement of the apparatus 22 through the pipeline 10 in the forward direction 28 . The apparatus 22 is provided with sealing means 42 including an annular elastomeric member respon sive to water pressure from forward of the apparatus to sealin gly engage the pipeline wall 40 to prevent flow of water from the first pipeline portion 24 to the second pipeline portion 26 .
