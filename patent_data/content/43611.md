# Amperometric cell.

## Abstract
A method of mounting and securing a membrane 15 of polymer film on an amperometric cell 10 that has a cylindrical cell end 12 provided with an electro lyte bearing sensor face 11 the holding member is a substantially non resilient and creep resistant die ring 20 having a cylindrical inner surface 23 that fits onto the cylindrical cell end 12 at least one tapered inner surface portion 22 extends outwardly towards a lead ing end 21 of the die ring 20 the leading end 21 is moved over the cell end 12 whereby the polymer film is deep drawn between the die ring 20 and the cylindrical cell end 12 and is permanently shaped to form a cup shaped membrane portion 150, 151 sealingly held by the die ring 20 on the cylindrical cell end 12 during operation of the amperometric cell 10 . An amperometric cell 10 having a cylindrical cell end 12 frontally provided with a sensor face 11 , a a membrane 15 formed of a flexible polymer film and extending over the sensor face 11 the membrane 15 is in contact with the cylindrical cell end 12 a holding member is arranged around the membrane 15 the holding member is a non resilient and creep resistant die ring 20 having a cylindrical inner surface 23 fitting onto the cylindrical cell end 12 and at least one tapered inner surface portion 22 outwardly extending towards a leading end 21 of the die ring 20 the membrane 15 has a permanently formed cup shaped portion 150, 151 sealingly held by the die ring 20 on the cylin drical cell end 12 during operation the die ring 20 can be removed, e.g. for cell maintenance and re used for applying and shaping a fresh membrane 15 . The invention is of particular advantage for sensors where ambient conditions of operation and cell mainte nance call for membranes of more than normal stability, e.g. oxygen sensors operated in an acqueous medium where growth of algae on the membrane is possible.
