## Description
This invention relates to a picture display apparatus and more particularly to a picture display apparatus for display of high density pictures of the raster scan type utilizing an electromagnetic deflection type CRT cathode ray tube . Fig. 1 shows a typical example of raster scanning according to a prior art picture display apparatus of the raster scan type utilizing an electromagnetic deflection type CRT. In this prior art raster scanning, a picture is displayed as the scanning proceeds from lefthand end to righthand end of a screen 1 as shown in Fig. 1 but the raster is erased so as not to display the picture as the scanning proceeds from righthand end to lefthand end within a short time interval about 0.15 X T The picture display apparatus of this type comprises, as schematically shown in Fig. 2, a CRT 10 including an electron gun 2, a horizontal deflection coil 3, a vertical deflection coil 4, a display data generator 12, a horizontal deflection circuit 14, and a vertical deflection circuit 16. With this construction, an electron beam 5 subject to a display data from the display data generator 12 is emitted from the electron gun 2 and deflected by magnetic fields generated from the deflection coils 3 and 4 supplied with deflection currents from the deflection circuits 14 and 16 so as to draw the raster on the screen 1. In addition, a voltage on an electrode not shown of the electron gun 2 is controlled to vary the intensity of the electron beam 5, so that the raster is modulated in darkness and brightness to display a picture on the screen. Fig. 3 is a circuit diagram showing the construction of the display data generator 12. Referring to Fig. 3, a memory 20 written with display data inputted from outside is a refresh memory capable of storing a data for one frame of the screen, and a shift register 22 stores a data for one horizontal period read out of the refresh memory 20 and sequentially outputs the stored data to the CRT 10. The refresh memory 20 is responsive to a write signal supplied from outside to write an external display data for one frame and is also responsive to a read signal in synchronism with a horizontal sync signal S The conventional raster scanning of CRT 10 will now be described in greater detail by taking, for instance, 1000 horizontal scanning lines per one screen one frame wherein a horizontal deflection frequency of 50 KHz and a vertical deflection frequency of 50 Hz are used for scanning. In the prior art system, a horizontal deflection current I and during the time interval for rapid decrease of I where f is a resonance frequency during blanking which is related to the blanking period T Thus, the horizontal deflection voltage V A transistor not shown for controlling the horizontal deflection current I A CRT picture display apparatus with the features set forth in the first part of claim 1 is known from DE A 3 030 888. IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin, Vol. 21, No. 12, May 1979, Pages 5025 5026 further discloses the use of a triangular waveform for bi directionally scanning a CRT to avoid problems resulting from rapid current changes, without however disclosing a circuitry to achieve such triangular waveform scanning. It is an object of the present invention to provide a CRT picture display apparatus with a horizontal deflection circuit designed to achieve a horizontal deflection scheme which can suppress the peak level of horizontal deflection voltage to a minumum. This object is met by the invention characterised in claim 1. The present invention will be apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Preferred embodiments of a CRT picture display apparatus according to the invention will now be described with reference to Figs. 5 to 14. The construction of the CRT picture display apparatus according to the invention is schematically illustrated in Fig. 5 where the same components as those of Fig. 2 are designated by the same reference numerals and a display data generator, a horizontal deflection circuit and a vertical deflection circuit which are characteristic of the present invention are denoted by reference numerals 32, 34 and 36, respectively. The manner of raster scanning according to a first embodiment of the invention is diagrammatically shown in Fig. 6, and waveforms of deflection currents, a deflection voltage and so on appearing in the first embodiment are illustrated in Fig. 7. According to the horizontal scan scheme of this embodiment, as shown in Fig. 6, the period for a scanning to proceed from lefthand end to righthand end of a screen 1 is made equal to the period for the next scanning to proceed from righthand end to lefthand end, and the periods for the bidirectional horizontal scanning are utilized for display of pictures. To realize this type of horizontal scanning, a vertical deflection current I at the most. Thus, this embodiment is effective to prevent the generation of the peak voltage V The vertical deflection circuit 36 and horizontal deflection circuit 34 for implementing the present embodiment will now be described with reference to a circuit diagram of Fig. 8. In the horizontal deflection circuit, the horizontal deflection 3 has one end connected to a junction of serially connected capacitors 50 and 52 and the other end connected to a junction of serially connected field effect transistors FETs 46 and 48. The FET 46 has a gate connected to one end of a secondary winding of a transformer 42, and the FET 48 has a gate connected to one end of a secondary winding of a transformer 44. Primary windings of the respective transformers 42 and 44 are connected, at one end, in common to a DC power supply of voltage V The Q output and Subsequently, the Q output bears the high level and the In the vertical deflection circuit 36, the vertical deflection coil 4 is connected, at one end, to an output of an operational amplifier 68 and at the other end to the earth through a current detecting resistor 70. A flip flop 54 has a set input S connected to receive the horizontal sync signal S The vertical deflection circuit of the above construction operates as follows Referring to section a in Fig. 7, when the vertical sync signal S Subsequently, the vertical sync signal S Referring now to Fig. 9, the construction of the display data generator 32 adapted to feed display data to the CRT 10 for implementation of the present embodiment will be described. The display data generator may be built in the picture display apparatus according to the invention or may be disposed exteriorly thereof. The following description will be given of the display data generator built in the picture display apparatus. In the display data generator 32, a refresh memory 20 and a shift register 22 are constructed in the same manner as those of Fig. 3. In the display data generator 12 shown in Fig. 3, the shift register 22 suffices to transfer data only in one direction to the left in Fig. 3 since the data is not displayed during the blanking period for the raster. In the present invention, however, data transfer in a shift register 22 must be bidirectional by being switched alternately to the left and to the right in order for each one scanning line to proceed since the data is displayed even during the blanking period for the raster. Therefore, according to the invention, a flip flop 80, AND gates 82 and 84, and an OR gate 86 are added to the display data generator of Fig. 3. More specifically, the flip flop 80 has a trigger input T connected to receive the horizontal sync signal S In a modification, the display data generator 32 may utilize the same hardware as that of the Fig. 3 generator on condition that data is written into the refresh memory such that the direction of writing data for each one address, i.e., for each one scanning line is inversed alternately. More specifically, the data for a particular address is sequentially written in the order of bit positions 2 Referring to Figs. 10 to 12, a second embodiment of the invention will be described. In the second embodiment, the vertical deflection current I Fig. 12 is a circuit diagram of a vertical deflection circuit 36 and a horizontal deflection circuit 34 which are adapted for the generation of that vertical deflection current. In Fig. 12, the horizontal deflection circuit 34 and display data generator are identical to those of the first embodiment. The vertical deflection circuit 36 shown in Fig. 12 has a counter 90 and a D A converter 92 which substitute for the flip flop 54, FET 56, constant current source 58, capacitor 60 and amplifier 62 of the first embodiment. In operation, the counter 90 is first reset with the vertical sync signal S Fig. 13 is a circuit diagram of horizontal and vertical deflection circuits for implementing a third embodiment of the invention. In the display apparatus for high density display of information by using 1000 scanning lines as in the present invention, it is desirable that non linear distortion of the raster be corrected exactly. From this standpoint of view, this embodiment adds to the horizontal and vertical deflection circuits of the second embodiment the function of correcting the raster deflection, that is, the function of correcting the non linear distortion of the raster. The deflection distortion of the raster on the screen to be corrected by the present embodiment is due to the fact that the screen 1 of CRT 10 is not arcuate but is parabolic. A correction circuit provided for the vertical deflection circuit 36 will first be described. A vertical deflection circuit 36 shown in Fig. 13 adds to the circuit 36 of Fig. 12 a ROM 100 which effects code conversion of the output from the counter 90 prior to delivery thereof to the D A converter 92. More particularly, the ROM 100 stores a great number of correction values k k Œîk corresponding to values k 0 to 1000 of the counter 90 and applies to the D A converter 92 corresponding one correction value k in accordance with the content of the counter 90, where Œîk is so set as to be 0 zero for k 500 and increased in proportion to an increased deviation or a decreased deviation of k from 500. Under the application of this correction, therefore, the vertical deflection current waveform can be blunted parabolically near its positive and negative peaks as indicated by chained line at section a in Fig. 14. This corrected waveform prevents expansion of the raster spacing at upper and lower portions of the screen to thereby make the raster spacing uniform over the entire screen. In the horizontal deflection circuit, a linearity coil 112 for correction of the raster non linear distortion is connected in series with the horizontal deflection coil 3. The linearity coil 112 is a saturable reactor which saturates as the absolute value of a current flowing therethrough increases. Accordingly, the current flowing through the horizontal deflection coil 3 saturates near its positive and negative peaks and its waveform becomes parabolic as indicated by chained line at b in Fig. 14. In this manner, expansion of the display data spacing at lefthand and righthand ends of the screen can be prevented, thereby correcting side pincushion distortion. Additionally, in order to make the correction for side pincushion distortion more complete, there are provided in this embodiment a ROM 102, a D A converter 104, an operational amplifier 106, and resistors 108 and 110. In particular, the ROM 102 delivers a correction value k corresponding to a value k of the counter 90, where k is so set as to be zero for k 500 and increased in proportion to an increased deviation or a decreased deviation of k from 500. The thus set correction values k are converted by the D A converter 104 into analog signals and superimposed on the power supply voltage V In this embodiment, the linearity coil 102 or the circuitry of blocks 102 to 110, or both may be employed for correcting the side pincushion distortion. As has been described, according to the present invention, the highly fine formation of display data can be materialized by increasing the number of horizontal scanning lines and in addition, the peak voltage developing across the horizontal deflection coil 3 can be reduced to a minimal value of 60 V which is about 1 20 of the peak level, 1256 V, of the conventional scheme. Accordingly, a transistor for general purpose can be chosen as the transistor for controlling the current I
