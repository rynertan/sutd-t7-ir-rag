# Drive unit for a conveyor of the tube encased cable type with spaced apart conveying elements, for materials of fluid behaviour.

## Abstract
A drive unit 10 for distribution systems for materials of fluid behaviour, such as livestock feed materials, in which a cable 15 provided with spaced apart conveying elements is caused to slide inside a tube, said drive unit 10 being of the type comprising a geared motor 12, 13 , on the output shaft 21 of which there is fixed a toothed wheel 14 about which said cable 15 winds. The geared motor 12, 13 is mounted on a supporting structure 18, 19 in a freely oscillating manner such that as the tension in the slack branch 23 of the cable 15 varies, the po sition of the axis of said toothed wheel 14 varies by virtue of its rotation about an axis 17 passing essentially through the point of tangency between the toothed wheel 14 and the taut branch of the cable 24 .
