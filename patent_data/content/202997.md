## Description
The present invention relates generally to data storage media and, more particularly, to a floppy disc assembly including a wiper spring which biases a fabric liner against a floppy disc. Widely used in the computer industry is a data storage medium including a floppy disc which is coated with magnetic particles and is positioned in a protective jacket . The jacket includes a base, a cover and a fabric liner. The floppy disc, while in use, is constantly cleaned by the wiping action of the fabric liner. The fabric liner has to be biased upwardly against the floppy disc by some means within the jacket. This means is presently a plastic wiper spring , usually polyester, located between the jacket base and the fabric liner and attached to a flat area of the jacket base by adhesive. This conventional wiper spring is shown in Figs. 1 and 2 herein. The conventional wiper spring requires that a crease be formed therein to force the floating, free end of the wiper spring up against the fabric liner, which liner in turn presses against the floppy disc. This spring action not only causes the cleaning action but also creates a drag on the floppy disc measured as torque. It is important that this torque be as constant as possible to induce rotational stability in the floppy disc and reduce the chance of harmonic vibration being created on the floppy disc. Use of the conventional wiper spring has its drawbacks, however, because a plastic spring does not exert the desired force at a constant compressed height over an extended period of time. In addition, a plastic spring is susceptible to gage variations, as well as other material variations during the plastic manufacturing process, which are substantial enough to cause a wide variation in the force exerted by the plastic wiper spring. The British patent GB A 2 100 048 describes a cleaning flexible magnetic disc cassette with a wiper spring for biasing a fabric liner against the floppy disc. However, the wiper spring is creased or bent. Consequently, the spring cannot provide constant bias force over time. In light of the above, the prior art still does not teach a wiper spring which biases the fabric liner of a floppy disc to provide the most efficent operation of the floppy disc. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a wiper spring assembly for a fabric liner of a floppy disc which is capable of exerting the desired force at a constant compressed height for an extended period of time against the fabric liner of a floppy disc. It is another object of the present invention to provide a wiper spring assembly for a fabric liner of a floppy disc which eliminates the need for creasing the wiper spring, which creasing necessarily limits the effective life of the wiper spring. It is another object of the present invention to provide a wiper spring assembly for a fabric liner of a floppy disc which is made of a material unsusceptible to wide gage variations. To achieve the foregoing and other objects of the invention and in accordance with the purposes of the invention, there is provided a floppy disc assembly including a wiper spring for the fabric liner of the floppy disc, wherein a flat sheetlike and preferably metal, wiper spring which is planar and is fixedly connected at one of its end portion to a ramp formed as a recess in the jacket base at an angle of the base of the floppy disc assembly to bias upwardly against the fabric liner and to efficiently force the fabric liner against the floppy disc. The metal is preferably phosphor bronze, beryllium copper or stainless steel. The wiper spring is preferably attached to the ramp of the jacket base via two or more moulded posts formed on the jacket base that protrude through corresponding holes formed in the wiper spring and are peened to hold the wiper spring in place. The assembly of the present invention provides for a more constant force exertion over a longer period of time than the conventional, creased, plastic wiper spring. The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of the specification, illustrate embodiments of the invention and, together with the description, serve to explain the principles of the invention. Fig. 1 illustrates a conventional data storage medium indicated by the reference numeral 10, which generally includes a floppy disc jacket 12 and a circular floppy disc 14. The floppy disc jacket 12, into which the circular floppy disc 14 is inserted and sealed, includes a cover 16 and a base 18. The base 18 includes a fabric liner 20 mechanically attached thereto. The fabric 20 is a layer of porous, fibrous, low friction material. The jacket base 18 has a circular opening 22 located at its centre which is slightly larger in diameter than a circular member 24 positioned at the centre of the floppy disc 14. The circular member 24 includes a small opening 26 at the centre thereof and a rectangular opening 31 off centre. When installed in a device adapted for recording and or reproducing information on the floppy disc 14, a means for centering the flopping disc 14 passes through the square opening 26, and a means for rotating the floppy disc 14 passes through the rectangular hole 31, thereby engaging the floppy disc 14 and rotating it about its centre. When information is to be recorded or reproduced from the floppy disc 14, a transducing means is inserted through a rectangular opening 28 formed in the jacket cover 16 and contacts the surface of the floppy disc 14. The jacket base 18 also includes a write protect tab pocket 27 for receiving a write protect tab not shown , which is accessed through an opening 29 formed in the jacket cover 16. The medium 10 also includes a creased polyester wiper spring 30. More particularly, Fig. 2 is a detailed view of the conventional wiper spring 30, illustrating attachment thereof to a flat area 33 of the jacket base 18 having parallel ribs 37 via adhesive 31. As can be seen, the wiper spring 30 requires a crease 39 therein to create bias. In contrast to the conventional wiper spring 30 shown in Figs. 1 and 2, Fig.3 illustrates the wiper spring assembly 40 according to the present invention. The wiper spring assembly 40 does not require a crease to create the required angle for bias. Instead, a ramp 42 is moulded into the jacket base 18 see Fig.4 and slightly inclined with respect to the surface of the latter, and a flat sheetlike wiper spring 44 see Fig.6 is attached to this ramp 42 at one of its end portions whereas the major part of said wiper spring 44 is located outside said ramp 42, overlays the adjacent jacket base area and biases the fabric liner 20 against floppy disc 14. The ramp 42 holds the sheetlike wiper spring 44 in a slightly inclined position with respect to the jacket base 18 and can be used with either the metal or plastic embodiments of the wiper spring 44 described below since the ramp 42 produces beneficial results with either embodiment. Overall, this wiper spring assembly 40 eliminates the variable that is a result of the conventional attempt to create a precision crease and having this crease remain stable over the life of the product. Fig. 4 best illustrates in detail how the wiper spring 44 is attached to the ramp 42 formed on the jacket base 18. Attachment is preferably accomplished via two or more of posts 46 formed on the jacket base 18 preferably in the ramp area, which receive corresponding openings 48 formed in the wiper spring 44 preferably at one border area thereof. The posts 46 protruding through the openings 48 are then peened to a size greater than the size of the openings 48 to hold the wiper spring 44 in position relative to the jacket base 18. As an alternative form of attachment, adhesive can be used. Fig. 5 is a detailed, plan view of the wiper spring 44 of the present invention. As can be seen, the wiper spring is rectangular and includes a rectangular opening or window 50 formed centrally thereof, the circular openings 48 for receiving the posts 46 and a locking cut out 52, which is used for handling the wiper spring 44 during assembly. The wiper spring 44 attached to the ramp 42 can be made of either metal or plastic, although metal is preferred for the following reason. There is a torque that is considered ideal to accomplish the cleaning action and to produce a stabilizing force against any harmonic vibrations that may be created in the floppy disc 14 during rotation. There is a substantial difference in the reduction of torque over time that favours a wiper spring 44 made of metal over a wiper spring 30 made of plastic. Accordingly, the present invention prefers a metal wiper spring 44 to a plastic wiper spring 30. Phosphor bronze, beryllium copper, stainless steel, and several other metal materials are the preferred metals. The characteristics of these metals are such that the force exerted over extended periods of time is more constant than is the case with plastic. In comparison with the convention, creased, plastic spring 30, a major benefit of the wiper spring 44 is the ability to intentionally vary the torque ratings by changing the window 51 size in the wiper spring 44. With the conventional, plastic, wiper spring 30 the torque cannot be increased above 25 gm cm., by increasing the crease 39 in the wiper spring 30, increasing the thickness, or both, and still maintain the narrow band of torque readings that are maintained with the wiper spring 44 of the present invention. In addition, placement of the wiper spring 44 on the jacket base 18 is also critical. With the moulded posts 46, peening is used to keep the wiper spring 44 in place. Placement accuracy is thereby guaranteed. With the conventional, creased, plastic, wiper spring 30 attached by adhesive, accurate placement is close to impossible. Another benefit of the present invention is that the pricing of the wiper spring 44 is actually lower than the overall cost of the conventional, creased, plastic, wiper spring 30 because of the greater amount of secondary processing required for the plastic wiper spring 30 to prepare it for assembly. Overall, the wiper spring assembly 40 according to the present invention substantially improves the reliability of the floppy disc 14 over the expected life of the product. The foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the invention. For example, although the embodiments described herein indicate that the wiper spring 44 should be attached to the jacket base 18, it is to be understood that in light of the fact that floppy discs are available in double magnetic sided versions, a wiper spring 44 can he used on either or both the floppy disc jacket cover and base.
