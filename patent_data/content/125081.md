# Toner transferring method and apparatus.

## Abstract
Electrostatographic apparatus and method for transfer ring charged toner present in an image configuration on an insulating layer 62 bearing an electrostatic latent image. The technique involves forming a sandwich comprising the insulating layer 62 with a conductive substrate 60 bearing a toner image 64 on its surface, a copy substrate 66 , a dielec tric layer 68 , and a conductive electrode 70 together with means for applying a potential to the conductive electrode after the sandwich is formed, the potential being of a mag nitude sufficient to create an electric field to transfer toner from the insulating layer 62 to the copy substrate 66 . The apparatus also includes means 52 to discharge the electros tatic latent image on the insulating layer before separation of the sandwich and means to strip the copy substrate from the dielectric layer while the field is applied to provide a toner image on the copy substrate. In a preferred embodiment the conductive electrode comprises a cyclindrical roll having a circumference at least equal to the length of the image on the insulating layer, and the sandwich is formed by wrapping a photoconductive insulating layer bearing a toner image in contact with a copy sheet around the roll with the dielectric layer forming a blocking electrode in between the insulating layer and the conductive electrode. During the wrapping step the translucent back of the photoconductive layer is exposed to discharge the electrostatic latent image on the photocon ductive layer and once the sandwich is formed it is unwrapped to separate the copy sheet from the dielectric layer.
