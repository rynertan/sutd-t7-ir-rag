# AN A.C. SUPPLY CONVERTER

## Abstract
An A.C. supply converter of the type described in co pending British Patent Application No. 80.06636 in which the control of the bidirectional switches connecting each conductor of a polyphase input supply to each conductor of an output supply is effected by a microcomputer, the operation of the program of which is synchronized by interrupt with the input supply. The microcomputer calcu lates for each output phase 2 values representing pulse widths out of a repeating sequence of 3 for three phase input and output supplies and pulse generators produce 3 abutting width modulated pulses in a constant period much shorter than the periods of the supplies. The interrupt operates a software phase locked loop, The pulse generators include an interlock circuit ensuring that the width mod ulated pulses do not overlap and an overload detector responsive to the turn on times of the switches. A default logic circuit responsive to hardware or software failure makes the width modulated pulses of equal duration.
