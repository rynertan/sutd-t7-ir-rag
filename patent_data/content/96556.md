# ASSOCIATIVE MEMORY

## Abstract
An associative memory comprises memory cells M arrayed in columns and rows, a pair of complementary bit lines a, b disposed for each column of the memory cells, a word line c disposed for each row of the memory cells, and a sense line S disposed also for each row of the memory cells. Each memory cell M includes a bistable circuit provided by a pair of cross coupled inverters, a pair of first switching elements Q₀ connected between the two nodal points N₁, N₂ of the bistable circuit and the bit lines a, b respectively to be controlled depending on the potential of the word line c , and a pair of second switching elements Q₁, Q₂ and a pair of diodes or like circuit elements X₁, X₂ having a rectifying characteristic connected in series be tween the bit lines a, b and the sense line S respectively. These second switching elements Q₁, Q₂ are controlled depending on the potentials of the two nodal points N₁, N₂ respectively in the bistable circuit. A load element R
