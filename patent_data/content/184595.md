## Description
PROCESS FOR THE SYNTHESIS OF N ALKYLPHTkLIMIDE BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The compounds known as N alkylphthalimides are used as intermediates in the production of nitro N alkylphthalimides. These nitro N aikylphthalimides are starting reactants for making a number of different organic dian hydrides and polyimides as shown by Heath et al., UnitedStates Patent No. 3,879,428. Prior art processes for making N alkylphthalimides such as N methylphthalimide have been based on the reaction of phthalic anhydride with aqueous alkylamine. The alkyl phthalamide is recovered by distillation of the reaction product. This method is objectionable because of the need to eliminate water in the recovery step. The use of melt reaction conditions has resulted in the production of byproducts which are difficult to remove. These byproducts include N,N dialkylphthalimides which interfere with reactions used to convert the N alkyl phthalimides into nitration products that are used to make organic dianhydrides and polymides.. A melt reaction for the production of N alkylphthalimides is described in UnitedStates Patent No. 4,020,089 anc is carried out in a hot tube reactor packed with a static bed of inert particies.The hot tube process is difficult to control in a large scale process because of the high heat of reaction involved in the formation of N alkylimides such as N methylphthalimide. Hot spots of up to 220 C. are typically recorded in this process. The exotherm from the making of M methylphthalimide is approximately 39 kcal g mole. The yields for the process are described in Example 2 of United States Patent No. 4,020,089 as being in the order of 72E. Spring et al., J. Chem. Soc. 1945 pp. 625 628, describe processes wherein various reactions of N alkyl phthaiimides and N,N dialkylphthaiimides are used to make various derivatives. The heating of N,N dimethyl phthalimide is described as a method of making N methylphthalimide in the Spring et al. reference wherein a yield of 75 is obtained. The present invention provides a novel method for making an N alkylphthalimide which is based on the reaction of phthalic anhydride with an alkyl amine in two separate reaction zones that are operated at two different temperatures. This method is capable of producing yields in excess of 99.5 of N alkylphthalimide. Accordingly, it is a primary object 0 tis invention to provide an improved method for making N alkylphthalimides that gives a pure product in high yields. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Fig. 1 is a schematic of a pilot plant apparatus for the practice of the inventive process. Fig. 2 is a schematic of a large scale apparatus for the practice of the invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION According to the present invention, there is provided a method or the synthesis of an N alkylphthalimide which comprises a contacting molten phthalic anhydride with a stoichiometric excess of an alkylamine to form a reaction mixture in a first reaction zone provided with agitation means b transferring said reaction mixture to a second reaction zone maintained at a higher temperature than said first reaction zone c adding additional alkylamine to said second reaction zone and d recovering substantially pure N alkylphta limide from said second reaction zone. The preferred N alkylphthalimide is N methylphthalimide which is derived from monomethylamine and phthalic anhydride Other analogous N alkylphthalimides may be derived using ethylamine n propyl amine n butylamine and the like. The first reaction zone is preferably a con tinuously stirred tank reactor which may be operated with a recycle loop that functions as the second reaction zone or with a second continuously stirred tank reactor that functions as the second reaction zone. The second reaction zone is always operated at a temperature higher than the first reaction zone. Agitation may be supplied to the reaction zones by any conventional stirring, shaking or turbulent flow techniques such as the use of a stream of inert gas bubbles. The phthalic anhydride is melted and fed to the first reaction zone which is maintained at a temperature of from about 155 1950 C and a pressure of 15 60 psia pounds per square inch absolute and preferably 35 60 psia. The residence time is from 1 to 2 hours. The output of the first reaction zone is separated into gas and liquid phases with the gas being directed to waste treatment and the liquid being directed to the second reaction zone. The liquid in the second reaction zone is admixed with an additional 20 50 molar excess of the alkyl amine. The temperature in the second reaction zone is from 175 2000C preferably from 180 1950C and at a pressure of 15 100 psia, preferably 35 60 psia. The residence time in the second reaction zone is from 0.5 to 2 hours. The output of the second reaction zone is separated into a gaseous stream and a liquid product stream which is substantially pure N alkylphthalimide. The use of the alkylamine in more than about 5 ifl excess of the stoichiometric amount in the first reacton zone has little effect on the conversion rate. Doubling the residence time or tripling the agitation rate increases the conversion by about 0.2 . Pressure and temperature increase also have little effect on conversion. The use of a second reaction zone increases the conversion to more than 99.9 with very little sensitivity to process variables. A stainless steel reactor may be used provided that the temperature is kept above 1400 C. The reactor should be capable of controlling the heat of reaction and usually it is necessary to supply an internal or external cooling means. The temperature in the second reaction zone is critical to the optimum performance of the process. If temperatures of 145 1550C are used in the second reaction zone, it has been found that the N,N dialkylami e may comprise from 5 to 6 of the product. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The following embodiments illustrate the process of this invention. They are merely illustrative and are not to be construed to limit the invention in any manner whatsoever. EXA2LES 1 i6 A pilot plant apparatus arranged in accordance with Fig. 1 is used to make N methylphthalimide. Phthalic anhydride is melted in melt tank 2 and is then pumped through line 4 by pump 6 to reactor 8. Nitrogen is supplied from line 12 which is connected to PA melt tank 2 by line 14 and to reactor 8 through line 16. Monomethlamine is fed from cylinder 18 through line 22 to reactor 8. Valve 68 is used to control pressure in reactor 8. The liquid product of reactor 8 is passed to hold tank 26 through line 28. The vapor fraction from reactor 8 is sent by line 30 to scrubber 32 which is provided with H2SO4 through line 34 to neutralize any monomethylamine. Vaive 36 is used to control the flow in line 30. Sample ports 38, 39, 40 and 41 are used to monitor the composition of the materials flowing in lines 30 and 28. Rupture disks 42, 44, 46 and 48 are conventional safety devices to relieve any overpressure in the system. Waste line 62 is connected to a waste disposal receptacle. Trap 64 is used to isolate anyN methylphthalimide from waste recovery line 66 prior to passing the waste through control valve 68. N methnlchtha limide is removed from line 70. Typically, 5.4 Ib hour flow of phthalic anhydride in conjunction with a 10 molar excess of monomethylamine in phthalic anhydride is established through the first step of an apparatus of the type described in Fig. 1. Reactor 8 temperature is 189 C, the agitator speed is 820 rpm, and the pressure is 35 psia. The phthalic anhydride content of the outflow is 0.4 . The conditions employed and the results obtained in twelve first stage reactor runs are summarized in Table 1, the typical run above described being listed as Example 12, entry 3, Table 1. A run through a second stage of reaction was simulated by collecting material from PI hold tank 26 and remelting it in melt tank 22. Typically, a run was made with a feed of 10 lb hr of a mixture of N methylphthalimide containing 8 phthalic anhydride with about a 20 excess of monomethylamine. The reactor temperature was 175 C, agitator speed was 800 rpm, and the pressure was 16 psia. The outlet stream contained 0.05 phthalic anhydride and 0.42 of N,N dimethylphthalimide. The results from a series of such runs are set forth in Table 2, the typical run being Example 16, entry 1. TABLE 1.

Melter 78 is.connected by line 79 to the main reactor 80 which is provided with stirrer 82. Monomethylamine is fed into vaporizer 84 from tank 81 through Valve 86 into line 88.Line 88 divides in line 90 and line 92 connected, res actively, to main reactor 80 and second reactor 94. The output of reactor 80 is fed to gas liquid separator 96 where the gaseous fraction is sent via line 98 to a waste treatment loop. The liquid phase is fed via line 100 by pump 102 to second reactor 94 where it.is agitated by a stirrer 104. The output of second reactor 94 is fed to degassing tank 108 via line 106. The gas fraction from degassing tank 108 is recycled to main reactor 80 via line llC. The product is transferred from degassing tank 108 by line 112 controlled by valve 114 to laker 50 in which is collected substantially pure N methylphthalimide. The products of the present process and its analogs are pure enough to be nitrated to 4 nitro N methyl phthalimide, 4 NPI and its analogs. 4 NPI is used in making commercially important resins. The results above demonstrate that the direct reaction of molten PA and gaseous MMA in a single stage continuous stirred tank reactor produces 99 PI over a wide range of temperatures, pressures, residence times, and agitation rates. About 8 excess is required to achieve 99.4 PA conversion in one pass. Greater excess of MMA does not increase conversion significantly. A second pass through a continuous stirred tank reactor with a moderate excess of MMA increases PA conversion to 99.9 . Operations of the second stage reactor at 1750 C. reduces the content of the most signi ficant organic impurity, N,N dimethylphthalimide to less than 0.5 . Other organic impurities were very minor, totaling less than 0.3 . The above mentioned patents and publications are incorporated herein by reference.
