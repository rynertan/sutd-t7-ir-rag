# Liquid detergent composition.

## Abstract
Aqueous, built liquid detergent compositions on the basis of a nonionic detergent, a builder salt, and a mono alkyl or alkenyl C₇ C₁₂ succinate as hydrotrope suffer from unsatisfactory storage stability at lower temperatures or under changing temperature conditions. By inclusion of a small amount of a C₁₀ C₁₅ alkylbenzene sulphonate, the stor age stability under these conditions is significantly improved. These compositions are particularly suitable for indus trial laundering purposes.

## Description
LIQUID DETERGENT COMPOSITION The present invention relates to an aqueous, built liquid detergent composition with an improved storage stability at low temperatures.Aqueous, built liquid detergent compositions are well known in the art. They are usually based upon an active detergent system together with suitable builder salts, and, to provide for the required stability on storage they normally comprise a hydrotrope system.Such hydrotrope systems are manifold, the most well known being toluene , xylene , or cumene sulphonates, alkanephosphonates, and solvents such as ethylalcohol. Frequently, however, the choice of a suitable hydrotrope is restricted by the type of active detergent and builder salt, and although satisfactory results can be obtained e.g. when the product is stored at room temperature, less satisfactory results are achieved when the product is stored under changing temperature conditions, or at lower temperatures.It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide for an aqueous, built liquid detergent composition which includes a hydrotrope system such, that the storage stability at lower temperatures is significantly improved. In particular, it is an object of the present invention to improve the low temperature storage stability of aqueous, built liquid detergent compositions which are based on a nonionic detergent active system and watersoluble phosphate builder salts, where this problem is particularly acute.It has already been proposed in GB Patent Specification 1,285,582 to improve the storage stability of aqueous, built liquid detergent compositions which contain a nonionic detergent active system and builder salts by inclusion therein of mono alkyl or alkenyl succinates, in which the alkyl or alkenylgroup contains from 7 to 12 carbon atoms, such as monooctenyl and monononenylsuccinate. Although such compositions have indeed a satisfactory storage stability at ambient temperatures, it is less satisfactory at low temperatures or under changing temperature conditions.It has now been found that the low temperature stability of such compositions can be significantly improved by inclusion therein of a small amount of an alkalimetal, ammonium or substituted ammonium salt of an alkyl benzene sulphonic acid in which the alkylgroup contains from 10 to 15 carbon atoms.According to the present invention therefore, an aqueous built liquid detergent composition with improved low temperature storage stability comprises a nonionic detergent active system, a water soluble builder salt, and a mono alkyl or alkenylsuccinate hydrotrope, and furthermore a small amount of an alkylarylsulphonate as hereinabove defined.The nonionic detergent active system used in the present invention can be any suitable type of well known nonionics, either alone or mixtures thereof.Nonionics are alkylene oxide condensation products with hydrophobic organic compounds. Typical examples are ethylene and or propylene oxide condensation products with alcohols, fatty acids, alkylphenols, fatty acid amides, and glycols. Numerous examples can be found in Schick, Nonionic Surfactants , 1967.Especially suitable are the condensation products of ethylene oxide 6 10 moles with nonylphenol, of ethylene and or propylene oxide 3 12 moles with linear monohydric primary or secondary alcohols with 9 15 carbon atoms, or mixtures thereof. In general, the amount of nonionic detergent active ranges from 5 25 by weight, the preferred range being 6 20 by weight.The water soluble builder salts used in the present invention can be organic and or inorganic builder salts, such as sodium citrate, sodium carboxymethyloxysuccinate, sodium nitrilotriacetate, sodium carbonate, sodium or potassium salts of ortho , pyro or tripolyphosphoric acid, such as sodium and potassium tripolyphosphate, tripotassium orthophosphate, tetrapotassiumpyrophosphate, and mixtures thereof. In general the amount of the phosphate builder salts ranges from 5 25 by weight, the preferred range being 12 20 by weight.The mono alkyl or alkenyl succinate hydrotrope to be used in the present invention contains from 7 12, particularly from 8 9 carbon atoms in the alkyl or alkenylgroup. These groups may be branched or straight chain, the latter being preferred. They may be used in the acid or anhydride form, their corresponding salts being formed in situ in the composition by neutralisation with alkaline material present therein, or they may be added in their salt form. Suitable salts are the alkalimetal, ammonium or substituted ammonium salts.In general, the amount of the alkyl or alkenyl succinate ranges from 3 15 by weight, the preferred range being from 4 10 by weight. The composition of the invention may furthermore comprise other ingredients, commonly used in aqueous, built liquid detergent coWpositions, Thus, it may comprise alkaline material such as potassiumhydroxide or potassium carbonate up to 10 , sequestering agents such as ethylene diaminetetraacetic acid, ethanehydroxydiphosphonic acid, ethylenediaminetetraphosphonic acid, triethanolamine etc. up to 2 , foam depressors such as soaps, silicones, paraffins etc. up to 5 , fluorescers in minor amounts, enzymes, perfumes, colouring agents, germicides, anti soil redeposition agents and so on.The alkylbenzenesulphonate which is used according to the present invention is an alkalimetal ammonium or substituted ammonium salt of alkylbenzenesulphonic acid, in which the alkylgroup is branched or, preferably, straight chain and which comprises from 10 15 carbon atoms. Suitable examples are sodium or potassium straight chain C12 alkylbenzenesul phonate. Generally, a small amount of these sulphonates is used, from 0.5 3 by weight, the preferred range being from 0.75 1.5 by weight.The compositions of the invention can be prepared in any suitable manner it is however advantageous to add the hydrotrope to the composition prior to the phosphate builder salts and neutralize the hydrotrope in situ.The products of the invention are particularly suitable for industrial laundering, especially to prepare stock solutions therefrom to be used in industrial laundering processes where these solutions are automatically dosed into the washing system. They are of particular benefit for the laundering of polyester cottong laundry.The invention is further illustrated by the following examples.Example IThe following compositions were prepared by weight EMI5.1 A SEP B SEP C SEP D SEP E SEP F SEP G SEP H SEP K SEP L SEP M tb sodiumtripolyphosphate SEP 9 SEP 12 SEP 12 SEP 12 SEP 12 SEP 12 SEP 12 SEP 12 SEP 12 SEP 12 SEP 12 tb potassiumtripolyphosphate SEP 3 SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP tetrapotassiumpyrophosphate SEP 6 SEP 6 SEP 6 SEP 6 SEP 6 SEP 6 SEP 6 SEP 6 SEP 6 SEP 6 SEP 6 tb nonylphenol, SEP condensed SEP with tb 6 SEP moles SEP of SEP EO SEP 5 SEP 3.5 SEP 3.5 SEP 3.5 SEP 3.5 SEP 3.5 SEP 3.5 SEP 5 SEP 5 SEP 5 SEP 5 tb nonylphenol, SEP condensed SEP with tb 10 SEP moles SEP of SEP EO SEP 5 SEP 3.5 SEP 3.5 SEP 3.5 SEP 3.5 SEP 3.5 SEP 3.5 SEP 5 SEP 5 SEP 5 SEP 5 tb sodium SEP straight chain SEP C12alkylbenzenesulphonate SEP 1 SEP SEP 1 SEP SEP 1 SEP SEP 1 SEP SEP 1 SEP SEP 1 tb oleic SEP acid SEP 3 SEP 3 SEP 3 SEP SEP SEP 1.8 SEP 1.8 SEP SEP SEP SEP triethanolamine SEP 1 SEP 1 SEP 1 SEP 1 SEP 1 SEP 1 SEP 1 SEP 1 SEP 1 SEP 1 SEP 1 tb nonenyl SEP succinic SEP anhydride SEP 6 SEP 5.5 SEP 5.5 SEP 5.5 SEP 5.5 SEP 5.5 SEP 5.5 SEP 6 SEP 6 SEP 6 SEP 6 tb potassiumhydroxide SEP 50 SEP 14 SEP 14 SEP 14 SEP 14 SEP 14 SEP 14 SEP 14 SEP 14 SEP 14 SEP 14 SEP 14 tb cocofatty SEP acids SEP SEP SEP SEP 3 SEP 3 SEP 1.2 SEP 1.2 SEP 3 SEP 3 SEP 2 SEP 2 tb fluorescers SEP 0.156 SEP 0.156 SEP 0.156 SEP 0.156 SEP 0.156 SEP 0,156 SEP 0.156 SEP 0.156 SEP 0.156 SEP 0.156 SEP 0.156 tb water SEP balance SEP bal.
