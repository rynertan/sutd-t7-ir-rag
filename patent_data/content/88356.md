# X ray diagnostic apparatus.

## Abstract
It is desirable in a digital subtraction angiography to realize the stereoscopic X ray image visualization of a blood vessel by means of an X ray diagnostic apparatus. In accordance with the invention, the object 2 such as blood vessels is projected by X rays before and after injection of the X ray contrast medium at two different projection angles with respect to the object, i.e., right view and left view. So right viewed X ray mask images and subtraction im ages video signals lr, llr and left viewed X ray mask images and subtraction images video signals II, III are separatedly obtained. Then the right viewed mask im age s video signal is combined with the left viewed one, resulting in one stereoscopic visual TV picture consisting of the desired portions of both the right viewed image and the left viewed image on the TV monitor 15, 16 simultaneously. Similar combination processing is carried out in the sub traction images video signals, so that one can observe stereoscopically the combined subtraction images of the blood vessels on the TV monitor 15, 16 .
