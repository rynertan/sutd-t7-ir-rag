# Electromagnetic relay.

## Abstract
An electromagnetic relay comprises a bobbin 2 carrying a coil 1 and having a longitudinal central bore 23 through which an armature 5 extends. A per manent magnet 4 is disposed between the central webs of two generally U shaped yokes 3 , the legs of the yokes having end portions cooperating with end sections of the armature 5 which project from the central bore 23 of the bobbin 2 . The armature is pivotal about a fulcrum formed near its one end, where as the other end of the armature 5 carries an actuating card 18 for driving a contact spring 19 disposed at the side, and parallel to, the bobbin 2 . The contact spring 19 is fixed at one end to a first contact ter minal 81 and has its other end disposed between two fixed contacts 25 connected to second and third con tact terminals 82, 83 . The three contact terminals 81 . . . 83 are disposed along a line generally extending parallel to the bobbin 2 . The coil 1 is connected to two or three coil terminals 6 , arranged at the other side of the bobbin 2 along a line which also extends generally parallel to the bobbin. The bobbin 2 with the armature 5 extending through its central bore 23 , the yokes 3 and the permanent magnet 4 are to gether press fitted in a recess of a base 7 in which the contact and coil terminals 81 . . . 83, 6 are em bedded.
