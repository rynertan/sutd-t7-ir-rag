# Catalytic converters.

## Abstract
A catalytic converter has a gas pervious catalyst support member extending across a housing and dividing the housing into an upper chamber and a lower chamber. The catalyst support member has two parallel spaced apart upper and lower foraminous sheets which undulate across the width of the container and form a catalyst containing chamber between the two sheets having a generally sinu soidal type wave configuration when viewed in cross section along a plane perpendicular to the length of the housing. A bed of catalyst particles substantially fills the catalyst containing chamber. A gas inlet at one end of the housing is positioned to cause gases to enter into one of the upper and lower chambers and pass through the catalyst support member and the catalyst containing chamber to the other of the upper and lower chambers, with a gas outlet at an opposite end of the housing being positioned to cause the gases to leave from the other chamber. A combined catalytic converter muffler may be provided by incorporating one or more muffler tubes in the housing in communication with the inlet and or outlet.
