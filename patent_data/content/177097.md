# Process for the separation of amides from nitriles.

## Abstract
A process for the removal of impurities comprising amides from a solution comprising nitriles and the impurities. A reaction mix ture is formed which includes the solution, a layered mineral comprising aluminum silicates having exchangeable alkaline or alkaline earth cations on the surfaces of the layers and an acid which has an acid strength sufficient to protonate the amides at amide protonation conditions, but in which the solubility of the salt of the acid and exchangeable cation at those conditions is such that the equilibrium of the protonation reaction is sub stantially in the direction of the amides remaining in a pro tonated form. The water content of the reaction mixture must be less than about 0.5 wt. for substantially all of the reaction time. The reaction mixture is maintained for a sufficient time at the amide protonation conditions for protonation of the amides and exchange of the protonated amides and exchangeable cations to occur, the protonated amides adhering to the surfaces of the layers. Nitriles having a reduced content of impurities may then be separated from the reaction mixture. Effective means of se paration are rotating drum vacuum filters, preferably two in series.

## Description
The field of art to which this invention pertains is the puri fication of nitriles. Specifically this invention relates to a process for separating impurities comprising amides from nitriles which utilizes an acid and mineral to effect such separation. Nitriles, particularly fatty nitriles, those derived from fatty acids, are important articles of commerce which are useful in the preparation of insecticides, gelling agents, fabric softeners and wetting agents. They may be hydrogenated to form primary, secondary or tertiary amines, particularly the valuable aliphatic amines. A common commercial method for obtaining nitriles is the cataly tic dehydration of fatty acids in the presence of ammonia. This method, however, yields, in addition to the nitriles, many trou blesome byproducts, including different amines which contribute color and odor, and also amides. Such impurities, particularly the amides, must be removed before the nitriles may be used in the various processes which produce the valuable products. There are many teachings in the prior art that deal with the pu rification of nitriles, usually by removing those byproducts of the nitrile synthesis reaction, primarily color bodies and amines, which are close in boiling point to the nitrile product and, therefore, difficult to remove by distillation. In the pro cess of U.S. Patent No. 2,622,097 to It is also known to the art that organic cations, particularly amines, may replace cations which were originally present on clay surfaces and that there is a strong preference of the clay for the organic cation. The present invention addresses a problem not specifically ad dressed by any of the above references comprising the presence of amides as an impurity in the nitriles. Nitriles produced via the above reaction in which fatty acids are dehydrated in the presence of catalyst and ammonia may contain amides in solution up to the saturation point about 0.9 wt. amide . The prior art method for removing these amides has been simple distillation which is sometimes feasible because of the significant difference in boiling points between the nitriles and amides. If one, how ever, has to work with nitriles of mixed chain lengths, distil lative separations may not always be possible due to the fact that the higher boiling amides of the shorter chain length co distill with the higher chain length nitriles. Distillation, also, requires considerable energy input which in an era of in creasing energy costs becomes increasingly unattractive. We have discovered a process that effects removal of amides from solution with nitriles without employing distillation. The primary objective to which the present invention is directed is the removal of amides from a solution of nitriles and amides. Accordingly, the invention is, in one embodiment, a process for the removal of impurities comprising amides, but which may in clude other impurities such as amines, from a solution of the nitriles and impurities. A reaction mixture is first formed which includes the solution, a layered mineral comprising aluminum silicates having exchangeable alkaline or alkaline earth cations on the surface of the layers and an acid which has an acid strength sufficient to protonate the amides at amide protonation conditions, but in which the solubility of the salt of the acid and exchangeable cation at those conditions is such that the equilibrium of the protonation reaction is substantially in the direction of the amides remaining in a protonated form. The reaction mixture is maintained for a sufficient time at the amide protonation conditions for protonation of the amides and exchange of the protonated amides and exchangeable cations to occur, the protonated amides adhering to the surfaces of the layers. It is essential for the water content of the reaction mixture to be maintained at less than about 0.5 wt. for substantially all of the reaction time. Nitriles having a reduced content of im purities may then be separated from the reaction mixture. Other embodiments of the present invention encompass details about feed mixtures, layered minerals, reactant proportions, choice of acids, separation techniques and operating conditions all of which are hereinafter disclosed in the following discus sion of each of the facets of the present invention. Nitrile feedstocks of primary interest to the present invention fall into one of the three types comprising coco nitrile , tallow nitrile and oleo nitrile . The compositions of these types, in terms of percent of fatty nitriles of various chain lengths, are in accordance with the following The amide impurity with which the present invention is particu larly concerned has the chemical structure There may also be a wide variety of other impurities, primarily amines, which may impart color and odor to the nitriles. Although not limiting the invention to a particular hypothesis, it is believed that the first step in the reaction is the double protonation of the above amide by the acid to produce an ion having the structural formula The choice of acid to achieve the above is very critical. First, the acid must be strong enough to double protonate the amide, and, second, the solubility of the salt of the acid and exchange able cation must be such that the above equilibrium effect will occur. Water content of the reaction mixture must be carefully controlled to a value less than about .5 wt. of the reaction mixture for substantially all of the time that the reaction occurs because of the solubilizing effects of water. To effect maximum amide removal there should also be an amount of acid in excess of the stoichiometric amount required to effect double protonation of the amides in order to provide a vehicle for the amide and exchangeable ions and because of a portion of the acid being consumed in the course of the various reactions. The above critical limitations to the present invention may be compared to teachings in the art such as in the above patent to The conditions at which the process of the present invention is carried out, referred to as the amide protonation conditions, are not critical. A temperature of from about 30 C to about 100 C and reaction time from about 30 minutes to about 4 hours are the con templated normal operating conditions for a fatty nitriles feed stock having carbon chains of from about 10 to about 18 in length. Control of the water content of the reaction mixture is best obtained by maintaining a vacuum pressure of from about 30 to about 150mm Hg, and more preferably from about 50 to about 75mm Hg. Of course, as the reaction mixture is being formed the water content may be above the required .5 wt. maximum because of the water content of the clay, acid and even nitrile feed streams, but the vacuum will quickly cause the water to evaporate and thus achieve the required less than about 0.5 wt. for sub stantially all of the reaction time. The vacuum applied to the reaction mixture provides the further advantage of increasing the rate at which the nitriles can be filtered from the mineral, particularly clay, since clay with higher moisture content tends to gel and form cake on filter means discussed hereafter which inhibits the filtering rate. The reaction of the present invention is best carried out by means of a slurry of the mineral and acid in the nitrile amide solution. Bentonite clay is an excellent source of the mineral and readily disintegrates in a liquid medium to the finely divided particles conducive to slurry formation. The acid, such as sulfuric, should be added to the slurry in the form of fine droplets so as to avoid charring and provide a good initial dis persion. The slurry may be maintained for the course of the reaction by agitating means such as a stirrer or mixer. A key step in the process of the present invention is the separa tion of the nitriles having a reduced content of impurities from the reaction mixture. We believe this to be best accomplished by means of one or more vacuum filter assemblies. Such an assembly is basically a filter medium, such as a filter cloth, one side of which, the feedside, is exposed to the fluid to be filtered, and the other side of which, the filtrate side is exposed to a vacuum, thus causing the fluid to be filtered to flow through the multiplicity of openings in the filter medium and, hopefully, the particulate matter to remain on the feed side of the medium. Useful filter cloths may be made of materials such as polyester, polypropylene or teflon, with pore openings, for use in the present invention ranging from about 10 to about 25 microns. The filter may be pre coated on the feed side with fresh clay to enhance its separation efficiency particularly with regard to fine particulate matter such as amides which have precipitated out of a nitrile feedstock supersaturated with amides. Rotating vacuum drum filters, such as those manufactured by Bird Young Company, are the most practical commercial scale vacuum filters, at least with regard to the process of the present in vention. The rotating vacuum drum filter comprises a feed holding vessel and a rotating vacuum drum having a curved surface com prising the filter medium, i.e. a filter cloth supported on the curved surface of the drum in the slurry. A vacuum is maintained in the drum and the drum is rotated about its longitudinal axis. Filtrate is drawn from the slurry into the drum and exits the drum via a conduit with which the drum is in sealed communication about its longitudinal axis. The filter may be pre coated by applying it first to a slurry of fresh clay in purified nitrile. In operation, the pre coating may be maintained at an appropriate thickness by continually cutting off excess clay with a knife a fixed distance from the feed side of the filter medium, but which may oscillate back and forth parallel to the longitudinal axis of the drum. Reference is now made to Figure 1 to illustrate the most pre ferred embodiment of the present invention, particularly with regard to the scheme for separating nitriles from the purifica tion reaction mixture. A slurry is shown in batch reacting tank 1, originally comprising clay, acid, and amide contaminated nitriles, which have been maintained for a time and under con ditions appropriate to the process of the present invention, in cluding the use of mixer 2. The reaction is now deemed complete and a batch of filtered and a purified nitrile product is to be recovered. Slurry is pumped via line 3 and pump 4 from tank 1 into holding vessel 5 of a first vacuum filter assembly. Partially immersed in the slurry in holding vessel 5 is vacuum drum 6, an end view of which is shown, which has a filter cloth about its curved peri phery. Drum 6 is rotated about its longitudinal axis 7. A vacuum is drawn in drum 6 and filtrate is drawn from vessel 5, through the filter cloth into vessel 6, and from vessel 6 via conduit 8 with which vessel 6 is in sealed communication. Conduit 8 empties into pre mix tank 9 via pump 10 where the nitrile is re slurried with fresh clay. Mixer 11 facilitates the forming and maintaining of the last mentioned slurry. Slurry is pumped from pre mix tank 9 via conduit 12 and pump 13 into hol ding vessel 14 of a second vacuum filter assembly. Partially im mersed in the slurry in holding vessel 14 is vacuum drum 15, an end view of which is shown, which has a filter cloth about its curved periphery which may be identical to the filter cloth of the first filter assembly. Drum 15 is rotated about its longitu dinal axis 16. Not shown in Figure 1 are various details such as the means for drawing vacuums in tank 1 and drums 6 and 15 e.g. steam ejectors and various valves and other process equipment. One item particularly worth noting is means, also not shown, by which accumulated particulate matter is continuously removed from the surface of the filter cloths. Adjacent compartmented triangular prism shaped pie shaped sections of the drums, the apexes of which are along the longitudinal axis of the drums, are sequen tially relieved of vacuum pressure, pressurized to superatmos pheric pressure with a gas, preferably air, and then restored to vacuum pressure. The pressurizing gas will flow from the filtrate to the feed side of each portion of curved surface of each section in sequence and blow off the accumulated particulate matter of that section. Certain best modes of operation of the above preferred filtration embodiment of the present invention have also been determined, at least on a pilot plant scale. The amount of fresh clay added to pre mix tank 9 is considered optimum with regard to particulate and color removal at about 2 wt. based on nitrile weight. Clay used for pre mix prior to the second filtration of the nitriles may be reused by combination with fresh make up clay to the acid clay reactor. Polyester medium is recommended for both vacuum drum filters, since it has been found to be structurally un affected by nitriles and acidic clay, may be used as relatively thin cloths which is conducive to high flow rates and is rela tively inexpensive as compared to materials like Teflon. Filtra tion conditions include about the same temperature as used in the acid clay treatment and a vacuum pressure on the drum filter units of between 590mm Hg to 150mm Hg abs. . The following non limiting examples are presented to illustrate the practice of the present invention and the establishment of the empirical relationships upon which particular preferred em bodiments of the present invention are based. Tests were run to determine the effect of the vacuum pressure required for the practice of the present invention for two dif ferent nitrile feedstocks. In all tests for this and other examples herein, unless otherwise stated, the source of mineral was a calcium bentonite clay acquired from American Colloid Company, known as Panther Creek Catalyst Grade and having the following composition and properties Composition Hydrous silicate of alumina composed principally of the clay mineral montmorillonite. Montmorillonite content 85 minimum. Contains small portions of feldspar, biotite, selenite, etc. Chemical Composition Typical Analysis Moisture Free Seven tests were run in a bench scale reactor with the acid 98 H₂SO₄ sprayed into a slurry of impure fatty nitrile and clay and the reaction mixture maintained for 30 minutes for each run. Tests 1 through 3 were run with coco nitrile having an amide content of .46 wt. , and UV and Gardner colors of 124 and 7, respectively. Gardner color is a standard color index used throughout the industry, while UV color is an ultra violet color determination at 420 nanometers wavelength with the UV value of a control sample comprising a nitrile having 0.75 wt. amide con tent and 7.5 Gardner color defined as 100. Tests 4 and 5 were run with tallow nitrile having an amide content of .39 wt. and UV and Gardner colors of 97 and 6, respectively. Tests 6 and 7 were run with oleo nitrile having an amide content of .43 wt. and UV and Gardner colors of 63 and 5.5, respectively. Following the reaction for each run, each batch was filtered through standard laboratory filter paper in a Buchner funnel having a filter area of 38.5 cm ² and a clay pre coating 0.5 cm thick. The data ob tained is set forth in Table 1. It is important to first note that the moisture contents of the reaction mixtures for each run at atmospheric pressure is cal culated to be about 0.98 wt. based on the water content of the clay, acid and nitrile, as provided, while that of the reaction mixtures at 74.2 mm Hg is calculated to be about .32 wt. . The effect of water content of the reaction mixture on the test results, with one exception, is dramatic for a given feedstream. With the feed of runs 1 through 3 there is about a 50 reduction in amides and a marked reduction in color APHA is another standard color index with approximately 100 APHA units equalling 1 Gardner unit . In runs 4 and 5 there was no apparent amide re duction with the vacuum system, but this is deemed attributable to experimental error, such as in analysis of the product sample, since there is no rational reason for the invention to be in effective for the particular feed used. In all cases, the vacuum provided improved results with regard to at least one of the color indexes and marked improvements in filtration rates at least for those feeds in which the filtration data was complete. Tests were run to determine the relative amounts of acid and mineral required for the practice of the present invention for various amounts of amide to be removed from the nitrile feed stock. As discussed above, the amount of acid supplied to the reaction mixture was in excess of the stoichiometric amount re quired to effect double protonation of the amides. From experi mental evidence Table 3 below one has to conclude that only the most acidic proton of the respective acid can be used for proto nation of the amide. The stoichiometric amount thus would be two moles of acid per mole of amide, but an excess is desired to provide a vehicle for the protonated amides and to make up for the amount of acid consumed. A series of tests similar to those of Example I were run on a tallow nitrile feedstock containing 0.75 wt. amide impurities, a UV scan of 100 and Gardner color of 7.5. The reaction conditions included 60 C and 74.2 mm Hg pressure. The amounts of sulfuric acid and or Panther Creek bentonite clay were varied between runs. The data obtained is as set forth in Table 2. All percen tages shown are based on the weight of nitriles. The data of Table 2 excluding color data is plotted as Figure 2 and appears as series of parabolas, one for each level of clay. It may be generally observed from Table 2 and Figure 2 that as the amount of clay and acid used increases, the amount of amide removed increases and the color indexes decrease. Qualitatively then, it is apparent that the present invention is effective in removing amides from nitriles as well as color bodies which are known to be amines. The latter is surprising in view of the teachings of the prior art concerned with amine re moval that relatively high water content in the reaction mixture is required with an acid clay treatment. Furthermore, the very interesting observation can be made, particularly from Figure 2, for a given clay level, that the amount of amide removed will increase with acid concentration to a maximum value and then actually decrease as the acid concentra tion continues to rise. This is attributable to the excess free acid causing desorption from the clay of previously adsorbed pro tonated amide. For the range investigated, a single approximately straight line may be drawn through the maximum amide removal point of the curve for each clay level, hereinafter referred to as the operating line . As will be shown later this operating line may be more exactly fitted to a parabolic equation. Figure 2 was replotted as Figure 3 with the scatter of Figure 2 eliminated and the curves of Figure 3 were fitted to parabolic equations. The solid lines in Figure 3 are the best fits accor ding to the following mathematical expressions where Ac sulfuric acid used in terms of wt. of nitrile AR amide removed in terms of wt. of nitrile The experimental data points of Table 2 fit well if above the operating line. Below that line, however, empirical curves have to be drawn as dotted lines. This is no contradiction in itself as two different mechanisms are involved on either side of the operating line. Up to the operating line, increasing amounts of acid at a given clay level remove increasing amounts of amide. Beyond the operating line more acid removes ever increasing amounts of previously adsorbed amide from the clay, thus showing apparent lower percentages of amide removal. From the data of Table 2 and from the above parabolic equations the following calculated data is presented as Table 3. The prefix m as used throughout the specification means milli or thousandths . The term ideal , as applied to the amounts of acid used, applies to the values calculated from the parabolic equations. Amide removed Quantitatively, several observations may be made from Figure 3 and Table 3. First of all, the optimum weight ratio of clay to acid for all levels of clay added appears to be about 10 1 based on an added clay and acid water content of 12 and 2 wt. , res pectively , which in terms of the mole ratio of acid to equiva lents of exchangeable cations is about 2.0 2.0. The latter ratio indicates that it is primarily the first proton from each sul furic acid molecule that is protonating the amides, i.e. the dissociation constant of the first proton pk Another observation is that the actually observed mole ratio of acid to amide removed varies from 2.37 at the 4 clay level to 3.16 at the 8 clay level. The theoretical stoichiometric mole ratio of sulfuric acid to amide should be about 2.0 1.0. Maximum amide removal at given clay level, therefore, requires an excess of acid, with the ratio of acid to amide required increasing with the amount of amide to be removed. It is worthwhile to obtain an approximation of the amount of acid that would be required for a given level of amide desired to be removed. The operating line of Figure 3 is considered the best such approximation available. The equation of the operating line of Figure 3 in terms of m moles of acid required vs m moles of amide removed, assuming the above ratio of 2 moles of acid per 2 equivalents of exchangeable cations, would be Ac 2.08A² 1.46A 0.35 where Ac m moles of acid and A m moles of amide to be removed. The plot of this equation over the range of Δ W amide removed shown in Figure 3 deviates little from a straight line. The term m moles of amide to be removed may be any amount up to and in cluding the starting amide level, although it is unlikely the process will remove the 100 of the starting amide content. One wishing to operate the process of the present invention would thus know, first, from the last stated equation, approximately how much acid would be required for a given desired level of amide removal, and, second, from the fixed ratio of clay to acid, established by the above experimentation, how much clay is needed. Of course, the operating line of Figure 3 is specific to a calcium cation and sulfuric acid system, it being understood that other cation acid combinations would produce a similar set of curves and operating line. Although the data for the above Examples was obtained with the Panther Creek bentonite clay, it should be again emphasized that any layered mineral having exchangeable alkaline or alkaline earth cations on its surfaces will serve the purpose. For example, the following Table 4 sets forth the exchangeable cation compositions as given by the manufacturers of various commer cially available clays. ¹ Panther Creek Bentonite ², ⁵ Settimio Cinicola, Vermeer Milano ³, ⁴ Societe Francaise des Bentonites et Derives ³ is natural calcium bentonite 7C N ⁴ is activated sodium bentonite 7C ARB Each of the above clays was used in accordance with the present invention to remove amides from a nitrile feed comprising tallow nitrile and 0.36 wt. amides. In all cases the amount of clay added was 6 wt. based on nitriles and the clay acid weight ratio was 10.0 1.0. Reaction conditions included a temperature of 60 C, a pressure of 74.2 mm Hg and a reaction time of 30 min. The results in terms of the analysis of the nitrile product are as set forth in Table 5. The data in Table 5 indicates that clays having sodium cations as the predominate exchangeable cation are also effective to a cer tain degree for use in the present invention. Direct comparisons of the different clays in their ability to effect amide removal, however, should be in the light that the different clays have different exchangeable cation contents, and that high calcium content in general is more beneficial for high desired amide removals. Since a basic premise of the present invention is that the nature of the acid used and the solubility of its exchangeable cation salts are important parameters in the process, a series of ex periments were run with four acids which significantly differed in their acid strength as well as the solubilities of their res pective salts. Reaction conditions included a temperature of 60 C, a pressure of 74.2 mm Hg and a reaction time of 30 min. and equal molar ratios of acid to exchangeable cations. The results obtained are as set forth in Table 6. Certain observations should be made at this point concerning the protonation of amides. Such protonation is known in the litera ture to occur when extremely strong acids are being used, as the protonated amide itself acts as a very strong conjugated acid having a pk For the four acids used pk For the aforementioned reasons only those protons are available for amide protonation whose pk Listing the above acids in descending order of their acid strength, we have It is re emphasized here that although the second proton of sul furic acid in these mechanistic considerations do not signifi cantly contribute to protonation, the pk Amide removal, however, does not follow this pattern of acid strength. This effect is even more pronounced when nitrile of higher original amide content is being used and is therefore a true phenomenon and not experimental scatter. If one now assumes that amide removal follows the mechanics suggested earlier, the acid with highest acid strength From the experimental data, an expression was derived combining pk The selection of acid may now be in terms of those acids which achieve a desired degree of amide removal, assuming a mole ratio of acid to equivalent of exchangeable cations of about 2.0 2.0, in accordance with the equation The above derived equation is an excellent fit of the experimental data as is evident from the following Table 8 and Figure 4. This empirically found equation is not limited to clays with Calcium as the predominant exchangeable cation. As shown in Table 4 when Colclay A 90 was used .4 CaO, 2.0 Na₂O an amide re moval of .20 was found experimentally for a starting amide of .36 . The solubility C of sodium sulfate decahydrate is reported to be 93 g 100 g water. Using the equation for this system yields a calculated amide removal of .219 which is also in good agree ment with the experiment. The purpose of this example is to illustrate the practice of the present invention in a preferred embodiment as shown in the flow scheme of Figure 1. 249 kg of tallow nitrile of typical composition as shown earlier Example I, tests 4 and 5 with an amide content of 0.38 and Gardener color of 5.5 were treated in a stirred reactor stirrer at 300 RPM at 60 C and 74 mm Hg abs. pressure with 7 Calcium Bentonite clay Panther Creek 12 moisture and .7 of 98 con centrated sulfuric acid which was added to the slurry of clay in nitrile over a period of 10 to 15 min. through a submersed spray nozzel. After an additional agitation time of 30 min. the acidic clay nitrile slurry was immediately filtered through a rotary drum vacuum filter Bird Young 0.46m² total surface area covered with a polyester filter cloth Tetko Inc., Elmsford, N.Y. HD7 17µ at an average vacuum applied of 200 mm Hg. Ac cumulated clay filter cake was continuously removed from the filter drum by applying air pressure from the inside of the drum to the cake discharge section of the rotating filter drum, se quentially to adjacent pie shaped compartmented sections of the drum. The filtration rate for the nitrile was 1453 l m²hr as an average. This first filtrate was fed to a second agitated vessel where 2 wt. of fresh neutral clay were added. After 20 minutes of mixing at 60 C this slurry was filtered warm through an identical rotary drum vacuum filter covered with a polyester filter cloth Tetko, Inc. Elmsford, N.Y. HD7 10µ at a suction pressure of 240 mm Hg an average filtration rate of 1335 l m²hr was observed. Cake dis charge was achieved exactly as described in the first filtration step. The so purified tallow nitrile was a clear liquid, free of mal odor, having a Gardner color 1 and containing .1 by weight of the amide impurity.
