# Starter with planetary gear type speed reducing mechanism.

## Abstract
A starter for an internal combustion engine comprises a starter motor 1 . A drive shaft 12 extends in coaxial relation to an armature shaft 6 of the starter motor 1 and has a projection extending radially outwardly from an axial end of the drive shaft 12 adjacent the armature shaft 6 . A pinion 34 is in spine engagement with an outer peri phery of the drive shaft and in meshing engagement with a ring gear 35 of the engine. The rotation of the armature shaft 6 is reduced in speed and transmitted to the drive shaft 12 through a planetary gear type speed reducing mechanism. A center bracket 20 comprises a cylindrical portion 20a rotatably supported by one of the drive shaft 12 and the armature shaft 6 , and a disc shaped portion 20b extending radially outwardly from an axial end of the cylindrical portion 20a . A shock absorber unit comprises a rotary disc 25 and a spring 27 disposed around the cylindrical portion 20a of the center bracket 20 . The ro tary disc 25 engages an internal gear 19 of the planetary gear type speed reducing mechanism so as not to be rotat able, but to be axially movable with respect to the internal gear 19 . The spring 27 urges the rotary disc 25 against the disc shaped portion 20b of the center bracket 20 . The rotary disc 25 and spring 27 are retained by a retainer 28 in their respective positions around the cylindrical 20a portion of the center bracket 20 .
