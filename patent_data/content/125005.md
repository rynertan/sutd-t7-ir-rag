# Fiber reinforced glass matrix composites.

## Abstract
What is disclosed is a method of preparing fiber rein forced glass composites from high modulus fibers and resin sols of organosilsesquioxanes, metal oxides, and metal alkox ides. The composites are obtained by firing a partially cured, pressed, and post cured prepreg to an elevated temperature in an inert atmosphere. A simple, low temperature laminating procedure is used in the preparation of these composites in place of the standard hot pressing technique.
