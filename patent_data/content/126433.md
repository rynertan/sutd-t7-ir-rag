# Silver halide color photographic light sensitive material.

## Abstract
A silver halide color photographic light sensitive material comprising a support having thereon at least one silver halide emulsion layer is described, the color photographic light sen sitive material containing a coupler having at the coupling posi tion thereof a group represented by formula I The silver halide color photographic light sensitive mate rial containing the 2 equivalent coupler having a group capable of being released upon a coupling reaction represented by for mula I has excellent color forming properties even when it is processed in a color developing solution which does not con tain an organic solvent for accelerating color formation, such as benzyl alcohol. A method of forming a color image using the silver halide color photographic light sensitive material is also disclosed.
