# Optical fibre of the graded index type and method of producing same.

## Abstract
An optical fibre of the graded index type consisting of a glass having predominantly the composition 60 70 mole SiOâ‚‚, 15 30 mole alkali metal oxides, 10 to 15 mole MgO in combination with at least an oxide selected from the group formed by CaO, SrO, BaO and ZnO is described. The content of impurities is less than 0.01 ppm. In the fibre the content of MgO increases, calculated from the axis of the fibre to the circumfer ence of the fibre. The content of the other oxide or the other oxides having cations which can be exchanged for the magnesium, cation decreases to a corresponding extent in this direction.
