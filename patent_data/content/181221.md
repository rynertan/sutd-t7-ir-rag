# Reflector Arrangement.

## Abstract
A folding antenna for use in a satellite communication system comprises a box having a base 1 which forms the supporting structure for the antenna. A main reflector 16 is mounted a platform 11 to which it is pivotted about an axis 14. A sub reflector 26 is pivotted to the main reflector about an axis 21. By pivotting the sub reflector and the main reflector downwardly they can be stowed into a position close to the base 1 and the lids 8 of the box closed to protect the system during transportation.
