The term cyanide source refers to a substance or substances which under the rearrangement conditions consists of or generates hydrogen cyanide and or cyanide anion. The process is conducted in the presence of a catalytic anount of a source of cyanide anion andVor hydrogen cyanide, together with a molar excess, with respect to the enol ester, of a moderate base. Preferred cyanide sources are alkali metal cyanides such as sodiun and potassiun cyanide cyanohydrins of methyl alkyl ketones having from 1 4 carbon atoms in the alkyl groups, such as acetone or methyl isobutyl ketone cyanohydrins cyanohydrins of benzaldehyde or of C25 aliphatic aldehydes such as acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, etc., cyanohydrins zinc cyanide tri lower alkyl silyl cyanides, notably trimethyl silyl cyanide and hydrogen cyanide itself.

Particularly suitable phase transfer catalysts are the Crown ethers. A number of different solvents may be usable in this process, depending on the nature of the acid chloride or the acylated product. A preferred solvent for this reaction is 1,2 dichloroethane. Other solvents which may be employed, depending on the reactants or products include toluene, acetonitrile, methylene chloride, ethyl acetate, dimethylform anide, and methyl isobutyl ketone MIBK . In general, depending on the nature of the reactants and the cyanide source, the rearrangment may be conducted at temperatures up to about 50 C.

The compounds of the present invention are useful as herbicides and can be applied in a variety of ways at various concentrations. In practice, the canpounds herein defined are formulated into herbicidal positions, by admixture, in herbicidally effective amounts, with the adjuvants and carriers normally employed for facilitating the dispersion of active ingredients for agricultural applications, reccgnizing the fact that the formulation and mode of application of a toxicant may affect the activity of the materials in a given application.Thus, these active herbicidal compounds may be formulated as granules of relatively large particle size, as wettable powders, as emulsifiable concentrates, as powdery dusts, as solutions or as any of several other known types of formulations, depending upon the desired mode of application. Preferred formulations for pre emergence herbicidal applications are wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates and granules. Ihese formulations may contain as little as about 0.5 to as much as about 95 or more by weight of active ingredient.A herbicidally effective amount depends upon the nature of the seeds or plants to be controlled and the rate of application varies from about 0.05 to apprcximately 25 pounds per acre, preferably from about 0.1 to about 10 pounds per acre. Wettable powders are in the forum of finely divided particles which disperse readily in water or other dispersants. Ihe wettable powder is ultimately applied to the soil either as a dry dust or as a dispersion in water or other liquid. typical carriers for wettable powders include fuller s earth, kaolin clays, silicas and other readily wet organic or inorganic diluents. Wettable powders nornally are prepared to contain about 5 to about 95 of the active ingredient and usually also contain a small amount of wetting, dispersing, or emulsifying agent to facilitate wetting and dispersion. Emulsifiable concentrates are hcmogeneous liquid compositions which are dispersible in water or other dispersant, and may consist entirely of the active compound with a liquid or solid emulsifying agent, or may also contain a liquid carrier, such as xylene, heavy aranatic naphthal, isophorone and other nonrvolatile organic solvents. Ebr herbicidal application, these concentrates are dispersed in water or other liquid carrier and normally applied as a spray to the area to be treated.The percentage by weight of the essential active ingredient may vary according to the manner in which the composition is to be applied, but in general comprises about 0.5 to 95 of active ingredient by weight of the herbicidal ccmposition. Granular formulations wherein the toxicant is carried on relatively coarse particles, are usually applied without dilution to the area in which suppression of vegetation is desired. Typical carriers for granular formulations include sand, fuller s earth, bentonite clays, vermiculite, perlite and other organic or inorganic materials which absorb or which may be coated with the toxicant. Granular formulations normally are prepared to contain about 5 to about 25 of active ingredients which may include surface active agents such heavy aromatic naphthas, kerosene or other petroleun fractions, or vegetable oils and or stickers such as destrins, glue or synthetic resins. Typical wetting, dispersing or emulsifying agents used in agricultural formulations include, for example, the alkyl and alkylaryl sulfonates and sulfates and their sodiun salts polyhydric alcohols and other types of surface active agents, many of which are available in comr merce. The surface active agent, when used, normally comprises from 0.1 to 15 by weight of the herbicidal canposition. Dusts, which are free flowing admixtures of the active ingredient with finely divided solids such as talc, clays, flours and other organic and inorganic solids which act as dispersants and carriers for the toxicant, are useful formulations for soil incorporating application. Pastes, which are homogeneous suspensions of a finely divided solid toxicant in a liquid carrier such as water or oil, are employed for specific purposes. These formulations normally contain about 5 to about 95 of active ingredient by weight, and may also contain small amounts of a wetting, dispersing or emulsifying agent to facilitate dispersion. For application, the pastes are normally diluted and applied as a spray to the area to be affected. Other useful formulations for herbicidal applications include simple solutions of the active ingredient in a dispersant in which it is oompletely soluble at the desired concentration, such as acetone, alkylated naphthalenes, xylene and other organic solvents. Pressurized sprays, typically aerosols, wherein the active ingredient is dispersed in finelydivided form as a result of vaporization of a low boiling dispersant solvent carrier, such as the Freons, may also be used. The phytotoxic compositions of this invention are applied to the plants in the conventional manner. Thus, the dust and liquid ocmpositions can be applied to the plant by the use of power dusters, boan and hand sprayers and spray dusters. The ccmpositions can also be applied from airplanes as a dust or a spray because they are effective in very low dosages. In order to modify or control growth of germinating seeds or emerging seedlings, as a typical example, the dust and liquid conpositions are applied to the soil according to conventional methods and are distributed in the soil to a depth of at least 1 2 inch below the soil surface. It is not necessary that the phytotoxic compositions be admixed with the soil particles since these canpositions can also be applied merely by spraying or sprinkling the surface of the soil. The phytotoxk ccmpositions of this invention can also be applied by addition to irrigation water supplied to the field to be treated. This method of application permits the penetration of the compositions into the soil as the water is absorbed therein. nust canpositions, granular canFositions or liquid formulations applied to the surface of the soil can be distributed below the surface of the soil by conventional means such as discing, dragging or mixing operations.
