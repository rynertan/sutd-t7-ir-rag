# Apparatus for photosynthesis.

## Abstract
An apparatus for photosynthesis includes a unique ar rangement for supplying light and CO₂ containing air to a reac tion chamber 100 in a sure and stable manner. The reaction chamber is irradiated for photosynthesis from the inside and or outside thereof in an intermittent mode. CO₂ containing air is routed from a CO₂ source to a rotatable disc 56 which is positioned in a bottom portion of the apparatus. Part of the CO₂ containing air is ejected sideways 60 from the disc to cause it into rotation, while the rest of the air is ejected up wardly 26 a into the reaction chamber. The reaction chamber is partitioned into a plurality of compartments A, B, C, D, E, F which are sequentially supplied with the CO₂ containing air in accordance with the rotation of the disc.
