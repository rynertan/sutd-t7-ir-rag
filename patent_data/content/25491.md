# A method and apparatus for detecting one or more spectral features in a sample.

## Abstract
This invention is directed to a method and apparatus apparatus for detecting one or more spectral features in a sample 16 . The method for detecting a single narrow spectral feature in a sample includes the steps of providing a beam of light 10 having an optical frequency bandwidth which is narrow compared to the width of the narrow spectral feature and having a centre frequency Ï‰
