# Mischief preventive electronic lock device.

## Abstract
A mischief preventive electronic lock device has a mischief prevention system which prevents lock unlock operation for a given period of time after a pushbutton input unit 11 has been operated extraordinarily often in compari son with usual number of keystrokes required for entry of an input code. The electronic lock device is normally operated to lock unlock a door matching by the input code with a preset code. The mischief prevention system is adapted to count the number of keystrokes from the input unit to perform the foregoing preventive operation whenever the keystroke count exceeds a predetermined value. The mischief preven tion system permits further input after expiration of the given period. This discourages trial and error attempts to satisfac torily protect the electronic lock device from mischief.
