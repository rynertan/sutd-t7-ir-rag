# Photomask and method of testing it.

## Abstract
A photomask 1 for use in the manufacture of a semiconductor device comprises a pattern P₁, P₂ to be tested and for use in forming the semiconductor device and an additional synchronisation pattern S₁ to S₂ . The syn chronisation pattern is used to obtain a synchronisation pulse E₁, E₂, E₅, E₆ during scanning of the photomask 1 for synchronising a scanning signal S₉ obtained from the pattern P₁, P₂ to be tested with a reference signal S₁₀ based on reference pattern data stored on a magnetic tape 7 .
