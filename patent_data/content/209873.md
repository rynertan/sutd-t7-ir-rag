# Hydration container.

## Abstract
A container for the dissolution of a tablet of material is characterized by a plurality of projections mounted within the container. The projections cooperate to define a tablet receiving recess adapted to confine a tablet inwardly there within in a relatively high energy zone during sonication of the tablet. Gaps between the projections define recirculating li quid channels whereby hydrating liquid passing through the tablet receiving recess may be recirculated to other regions of the compartment.
