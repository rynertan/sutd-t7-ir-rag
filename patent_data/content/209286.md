# Static hydraulic continuously variable transmission.

## Abstract
A static hydraulic continuously variable transmission T which is disclosed herein includes a cylinder block B which is secured to an output shaft 25 and constituted of a pump cylinder 7 of a hydraulic pump P and of a motor cylinder 17 of a hydraulic motor M , these cylinders 7, 17 being con nected to each other. In the transmission T , a number of pump cylinder bores 8 and a number of motor cylinder bores 18 are annularly arranged respectively. The transferring of a work ing oil out of one into another of the pump cylinder bores 8 and the motor cylinder bores 18 is conducted through a pair of oil chambers 40, 41 concentrically provided around the output shaft 25 , and the communication between these cylinder bores 8, 18 is controlled by a number of first and sec ond dispensing valves 45, 46 extending between both the oil chambers 40, 41 and adapted to be reciprocally radially moved. There is no relatively sliding portion between the pump cylinder 7 and the motor cylinder 17 . Thus, the transferring of the working oil is reliably conducted and a higher transmit ting efficiency is provided.
