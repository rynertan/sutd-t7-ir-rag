# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR DETECTION OF COMPLEMENT PATHWAY ACTIVATION

## Abstract
A method and system for detecting and preferably meas uring the presence of an activated complement complex in a sample is discussed. The presence of such an activated com plex is indicative of complement pathway activation and in cludes a first complement component and a second comple ment component. The method uses a first binding agent specif ic to the first complement component and a second binding agent specific to the second complement component which when bound with the complex forms an aggregate. The second specific binding agent includes a label whose presence is used to detect and measure the amount of aggregate and therefore activated complex in a sample. An assay system and aggregate for use in an assay system are also discussed.
