# EARTHQUAKE PROOF TUBE SUPPORT GRID

## Abstract
An earthquake proof support grip for supporting tubes in a steam generator, heat exchanger or the like, particularly for use in P.W.R. nuclear plants and for special heat exchangers for use in petro chemical plants, comprising a reticular structure formed of main 1 x , 2 x and secondary 3 x , 6 x intersecting strips and an annular frame enclosing said reticular structure, said frame 30 a , 30 a being formed of material having the same coefficient of thermal expansion of the strips or said frame comprising an internal frame 30 b , 30 b formed of material having the same coefficient of thermal expansion of the strips and an external frame 40 b , 40 b formed of material having a lower coefficient of thermal expansion than that of the strips. Said reticular structure is characterized in that all said secondary strips or only some thereof 3 x , 4 x have interengaging slots 21 with portions of said main strips, at the intersecting zone therebetween. and that all strips or only some thereof have the ends 7 x , 8 x shaped in the form of a hammer 0 head profile or a dovetail profile or the like, and that said strip ends are received and blocked without clearance in grooves 23 x , 24 x formed in the frame body 30 a , 30 a 30 b , 30 b , said grooves being shaped also respectively in the form of a hammer head profile or dovetail profile or the like, in order to prevent the relative movement or the sliding between said strip ends and the said frame enclosing the same. Said hammer head connections or dovetail connec tions or the like between the said strip ends and the said frame body being provided to resist severe forces acting on said tube support grid, at all operative temperatures, and caused by the highest grade seismic event together with the greatest accident, such as the burst of a pipe of the primary circuit of a steam generator for use in a nuclear power plant.
