# Umbrella.

## Abstract
An umbrella is disclosed which is provided in a compact collapsed form wherein a removably housed compressed gas container 14 is selectively actuated to inflate the umbrella canopy 10 . The canopy is formed with tubular ribs 15 which when inflated by gas under pressure open the canopy for use.

## Description
This invention relates to umbrellas and particularly to umbrellas which are rapidly openable. Heretofore umbrellas are openable by manual or spring loaded mechanical means. The mechanical construction elements, particularly the metal rib elements of the canopy were often subject to damage or breakage particularly with the umbrella in the opened condition. Such damage rendered the umbrella inoperable, and the umbrella was discarded. Furthermore the mechanical opening was often difficult for people of limited or impaired strength. An urXrel a according to the present invention is characterised in that the canopy has inflatable means formed to contain a fluid under pressure and to open the canopy for use during inflation by said fluid. Preferably,the stem of the umbrella has therein a chamber for removably housing a pressurised gas container having aa outlet valve and in that the stem has means thereon to operate the outlet valve and release gas from the container for inflating the inflatable means to open the canopy. It is thus possible to provide an umbrella which eliminates those mechanical elements of conventional umbrellas which were subject to damage and difficult to manipulate. Advantageously, the stem supports two members which are interengageable to enclose the canopy, when deflated, therebetween and which are moved apart by the canopy as, in use, it extends. It is thus possible to provide an umbrella which is compact when closed. Desirably, the inflatable means comprises a plurality of inflatable tubular ribs connected to or formed integrally with the canopy. The ribs may comprise plastics material. It is thus possible to provide an umbrella which is lightweight in use. The canopy is, conveniently, detachable for ease of replacement. The invention will now be more particularly described with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein FIG. 1 is a plan view of a canopy of one embodiment of an umbrella according to the invention, in an inflated state, FIG. 2 is a full front elevational view of the umbrella of Fig. 1 when in an inflated state, FIG. 3 is a side elevational view of the canopy without stem, FIG. 4 is a side view of a connection, by which both sections of the stem are joined together, function as an outlet valve, in sectIon, FIG. 5 is a side view of the handle stem with compressed gas container in section, FIG. 6 is a plan view of the handle stem, FIG. 7 shows two side views of a valve in section, FIG. 8 is a side view of a clasp as used to connect the two interengageable members that enclose the canopy when in a deflated state in section, FIG. 9 is a side view of one of the two pivot hinges with which the members, as mentioned in FIG. 8, are attached to the handle stem in section FIG. 10 is a side view illustrating the members, as mentioned in Fig. 8, in a closed position and FIG. 11 is a side view illustrating the members, as mentioned in Fig. 8, reposed horizontally on opposite sides of the handle stem in an open ppsition. Referring to the drawings, the umbrella shown therein comprises a canopy 10 which is inflated by means of pressing a handle grip 11 see Fig. 5 against the action of a return spring 12, into engagement with a valve stem 13 of a compressed gas container 14 to raise a valve member 13 from its seating 13 see Fig. 7 thereby causing the contents of the compressed gas container 14 to be discharged into inflatable ribs 15 see Figs. 1 3 , which communicate with each other and are made of and connected by transparent plastics material to form the canopy 10 which is of dome shape, the gas flowing via an extension of a rib 15 in the form of a collar 16 which abuts the open end of handle stem 17 and is held thereon by a screw threaded attachment 18 so that the stem is not centrally located with respect to the canopy as in most umbrellas.The handle stem 17 comprises two inter engageable sections 19 and 20 which define a chamber for housing the compressed gas container and are releasably connected together at 21 such as by mutually engageable screw threads to permit removal, for recharge or replacement, of the compressed gas container. The gas container 14 may be refillable e.g.from a compressed air supply such as is commonly available on garage forecourts i.e. petrol stations . The screw threaded connection 21 between both sections of the stem also functions as a gas release or outlet valve and is used for the purpose of deflating the detachable canopy 10, e.g. when the connection 21 is partially unscrewed or screwed apart the gas supporting the canopy 10 is allowed to escape through openings 22 situated in the outer wall of the connection 21 as illustrated inFigure 4. The stem 17 also carries two interengageable members 23 and 24 which form a cover for enclosing the canopy, when deflated, and which are moved apart by the canopy as it expands while it is being inflated. The two sections 23 and 24 are attached to the stem 17 by two pivot hinges 25, as illustrated in Figure 9, on which they are allowed to swing freely apart and repose horizontally on opposite sides of the stem 17, as illustrated in Figure 2 and Figure 11, while the umbrella is inflated and in use. Figure 5 shows how the compressed gas container 14 is housed upside down inside the stem 17 so that its valve stem 13 comes into direct contact with the handle grip mechanism 11, 12. While the afore discussed embodiment refers two air pressure it is to be appreciated that any fluid, i.e.liquid or gas, may be employed. All components used for the construction and assembly of the above described umbrella may be manufactured in plastics material with the exception of the return spring 12 and the removably housed compressed gas container 14.
