There may be first and second such transistor switches responsive to the first and second inhibiting signals respectively. Alternatively, there may be 2 single transistor switch with logic gating circuitry for receiving the first and second inhibiting signals.Each of the switching means may comprise a TRIAC.One oil burner control system embodying the invention will now be described with reference to the drawings, in which Figure 1 shows the logic circuitry of the system Figure 2 shows interface circuitry which controls the burner ignition, motor and valve in response to signals from the logic circuitry andFigure 3 is a circuit diagram of the power supply and flame sensor. Title control system illustrted i is suitable for use in a central heating system. Jt is only one exnmple of forms which the invention might take.A brief description of the operation of the control system uill be given first, followed by more detailed description of the circuitry.The system is energised by means of a thermostat which can be positioned in a room to sense air temperature or on a after cylinder or tank to sense the temperature of the after. Initially the motor of the air blower and the ignition are energised for e period of about 15 seconds whilst the solenoid valve remains closed, in order to purge the nozzle region. The solenoid valve is then opened and a steady flay is established at the burner nozzle, its presence being indicated by the signal from an optical sensor. About 12 seconds after the solenoid valve was opened thE ignition is switched off, provided that the flame is established, and the burner continues until the desired temperature is reached and the thermostat switches the system off.If the flame is not present at the end of the 12 second period, then the ignition, the motor and the solenoid valve are switched off and an indicator is brought on to show that no flame is present. r feedback signal keeps these elements switched off for E period of about 75 seconds, after which the control sequence can be started by means of a reset button. The system is also switched off and disabled in the event that the flame, once established, is extinguished, for example by excessive down draught.Considering first Figure 3, in normal operation the system is initially energised by the closing of thermostat contacts 10 which are connected to one end of the primary winding 11 of a mains transformer 12 and to a neutral mains terminal 13 via a resistor 14. The other end of winding 11 is connected to a live mains terminal 1 Ilso connccted to terminal 15 are output terminals 16, 17 csfld 1R which are connected to the ionition device not shown , the motor not shab7n rnd the solenoid valve not shown , respectively, which are connected to respective TRlACs referred to liter in the interface circuitry of Figure 2.The transformer 12 has a centre tapped secondary winding 20 which feeds a pair of diodes 21 arranged for fullwave rectification with their anodes connected to an output terminal 22. A capacitor 23 is connected between terminal 22 and an output terminal 24 which is connected to the centre tap of the secondary winding 20. f further secondary winding 25 is also provided this feeds a bridoe rectifier 26 whose output is connected to an output terminal 27 and the output terminal 22. smoothing capacitor 28 is connected between output terminals 22 and 27.The transformer is selected so that, relstive to terminal 24, terminal 22 provides a 3 volts negative power supply line and terminal 27 provides 8 12 volts negative power supply line. A bridge rectifier 30 has its input terminels connected across the resistor 14 and its output terminals connected to a smoothing capacitor 31. Connected in a series circuit across the capacitor 31 are a light responsive resistor 32, a LED transmitter 33 of an optical coupler, and a resistor 34, comprising a flame sensor circuit.If desired, resistor 32 can be responsive to infra red radiation.Thus, upon closing of the thermostat contacts 10 the power supply lines are energised, and so is the flame sensor circuit.Considering now Figures 1 and 2, line 35 is connected to terminal 24, line 36 is connected to terminal 27 12 volts and line 37 is connected to terminal 22 3 volts . Capacitor 38 is directly connected to line 36 and is connected to line 35 via series connected resistor 40 and v.ricUle resistor 41. The junction of capacitor 38 nd resistor 40 is connected vi resistor 42 to the inputs of AND gate 43 whose output is connected via resistor 44 to the inputs of NAI D gate 45 and via resistor 46 to the inputs of WAND gate 47. The output of gate 47 is connected to a line U which is connected via resistor 48 to the base of a control transistor 49 whose emitter is connected to line 35 and whose collector is connected via a load resistor 50 to line 37. P TRIAC 51 is connected between line 35 and a terminal 52 to which the solenoid valve not shown is connected.The gate of TRItC 51 is connected via z pair of seriesconnected forward biased diodes 53 to the collector of transistor 49 viz a resistor 54 to line 35. A voltagedependent resistor 55 is connected between terminal 52 and line 35.Initially, the capacitor 38 is in a discharged state having discharged through the power supply via a diode 56 connected across resistors 40 and 41. This renders the inputs of gate 43 high i.e. towards line 36 relative to line 35 for a time delay determined by capacitor 38 and resistors 40 and 41. This delay is set at approximately 15 seconds in this particular embodiment.Thus, the output of gate 47 is high during this delay, and transistor 49 is conducting, so that there is no current flow through diodes 53 to switch on TRIAC 51 and the solenoid valve remains unenergised.A similar TRIAC control for the blower motor not shown comprises TRIAC 57, resistor 58, voltage dependent resistor 59, a pair of diodes 60 and terminal 61 and a further similar TRIAC control for the ignition device not shown comprises TRIAC 62, resistor 63, voltagedependent resistor 64, a pair of diodes 65 and terminal 66. Diodes 65 are connected to the collector of a transistor 67 hiving a load resistor 6B and E base resistor 69 in the same manner Ps transistor 49, but diodes 60 sre coupled to line 37 via Ï load resistor 70 with no corresponding control transistor so the blower motor becomes energised as soon as the power lines become established upon closing of switch 10.The output of gate 45 is connected via z resistor 71 and a clamping diode 72 to another RC delay circuit comprising capacitor 73, resistor 74, and veriable resistor 75, which is set to provide E delay of approximately 12 seconds. The junction of capacitor 73 and resistor 74 is connected via resistor 76 to the inputs of E P.tD gate 77 whose output is connected to a line T which is connected to base resistor 69 of control transistor 67.During the first delay period of 15 seconds the output of gate 45 is high and clamps the input of gate 77 high so that its output on line T is low and control transistor 67 is non conducting. TRIC 62 is thus on and the ignition device is energised.Gate 77 is also connected via a resistor 78 to the inputs of E NPND gate 79 whose output is connected via a resistor 80 and a series connected clamping diode 81 to a capacitor 82 connected to line 36. The junction of diode 81 and capacitor 82 is connected via resistor 83 to the inputs of a NAND gate 84 whose output is connected via resistor 85 to the inputs of 2 NND gate 86 whose output is connected to a line B and this junction is connected to line 35 via series connected resistors 87 and 88.The receiver part 89 of the optical couples is connected between line 36 and the junction of resistors 87 and 88.The low output of gate 77 drives the output of gate 79 high which clamps the input of gate 84 high, so causing lin Ll to bc high. This signal is fed via a resistor 90 to the base of an r pt transistor 91 Whose emitter is connected to line 3f, and whose collector is connected to line 35 via a resistor 9 , to the base of a PNP transistor 93 via a resistor 94 and to the base of a PkP trPns istor 95 via a capacitor 96. The emitters of transistors 93 and 95 are connected to line 35. Transistor 93 has a load resistor 97 connected to line 36, and its collector is connected to diodes 53, 60 and 65 via respective diodes 98, 99 and 1D0, and to a forward biased diode 101 which in turn is connected to line 36 via series connected resistor 102 and LED 103.Thus transistors 91 and 93 are non conducting and diodes 9B, 99 and 100 are reverse biased via resistor 97 and do not disable the TRIAC drives.The collector of transistor 95 is connected to line FB feedback which is connected vie diode 104 and resistor 105 to the input of kAt0 gate 106, and the junction of diode 104 and resistor 105 is connected via parallel connected resistor 107 and capacitor 108 to line 36. The output of gate 106 is connected to line A which is connected to the base of E PNP transistor 109 via 2 resistor 110, the collector is connected to line 36 and the emitter is connected to line 35 via a resistor 111 and to the base of a pkp transistor 112 via a resistor 113.Transistor 112 has a load resistor 114 connected to line 36 and its collector is connected to diodes 53, 60 and 65 via respective diodes 115, 116 and 117 and to resistor 102 via diode 118.Initially, transistor 95 will be non conducting because transistor 91 is non conducting, and the input of gate 106 will be held high via resistors 105 and 107. Thus line A will be low and transistors 109 and 112 will be non conducting and diodes 115, 116 and 117 are reversebiased via resistor 114 and do not disable the TRIAC drives. At the end of the first delay period of 15 seconds the input of gate 43 goes low and hence the signal on line V goes low resulting in control transistor 49 becoming nonconducting and TRIAC 51 switching on to energise the solenoid valve for the flow of oil to the nozzle. Also, the output of gate 45 goes low and removes the clamping action on the input of gate 77 and allows the second delay period of 12 seconds to begin, with capacitor 73 charging via resistors 74 and 75.At the end of this second delay period the input of gate 77 goes lou and the signal on line T goes high which results in control transistor 67 turning on. TRIAC 62 is thus switched off and the ignition device is deenergised. Also, the output of gate 79 goes low and removes the clamping action of the input of gate 84 and allows a further delay period of about second to begin, with capacitor 82 charging via resistors 87 and 88 in the event that the flame has not established itself and receiver 89 is thus non conducting.At the end of this further delay period i.e. for no established flame the input of gate 84 goes low end the signal on line B goes low which turns on transistor 91.This results in transistor 93 turning on and switching off all the TRIACs via diodes 98, 99 and 100, and energising the alarm LED 103. Also capacitor 96 starts to charge via the base emitter junction of transistor 95 causing it to conduct while capacitor 96 charges, and pull the input of gate 106 low via diode 104. The signal on line A thus goes high which causes transistors 109 and 112 to conduct whereby diodes 115, 116 and 117 act to switch off the TRIACs, and LED 103 is also energised via diode 118. The collector load for transistor 95 is resistor 107 and capacitor 108 which charges to nearly 12 volts.When capacitor 96 becomes fully charged, there is no base current for transistor 95 which then ceases conducting and allows capacitor 108 to strut discharging via resistor 107 back to its norml level. The delay set for this is approimately 75 seconds and during this period the signal on line R remains high thus inhibiting any action of the TRlAC circuits in response to signals on lines T tnd V, znd energising the alarm LED 103.A manual reset push button 119 is connected across cap Ocitor 38 and, upon actuation, short circuits capacitor 38 to provide a high signal to the input of gate 43.Thus gates 45 and 79 provide high outputs which discharge capacitors 73 and 82 via diodes 72 and 81, respectively, and the ignition timing sequence is reedy to recommence.The signal on line B goes high when push button 119 is actuated, but as explained, the signal on line R will inhibit the TRIAC circuits for approximately 75 seconds.If an operator actuates the push button 119 during this period, it will be immediately apparent because the alarm LED 103 will not extinguish. The operator will remain pressing the push button 119 until at the end of this period the signal on line A goes low and the LED 103 extinguishes.If flame establishes normally during the ignition sequence, then receiver 89 of the optical coupler will be conducting and will provide E high signal via resistor 87 to the input of gate 84. Thus at the end of the further delay period the system is in a steady state with the blower on, the solenoid valve open, the ignition device off and an established flame.Should for any reason the flame sensor circuit determine that the flame is not present this will normally be due to loss of radiation falling on resistor 32, but includes a component failure in the flame sensor circuit , then the receiver 89 of the optical coupler will be nonconducting and capacitor 82 will charge rapidly via resistors 87 and 88. Thus a low signal will be present on line B and the system will be locked out as described for the period determined by capacitor 108 and resistor 107.After the end of this lock out period thE signal on lineA will be low but the signal on line R will be low, so the system remains off with LED 103 energised. The ignition sequence will now start the instant the operator presses the reset push button 119.In the rbove described system capacitor 38 will start charging via resistors 40 and 41 Es soon as the operator releases the reset push button 119. Thus if he attemptsE restart during the lock out period he will have to keep the reset push button actuated until the LED 103 extinguishes in order to start the timing sequence at the correct time. If the push button 119 is released some time before the end of the lock out period then the 15 second purge period could finish without any purge action having taken place, and the system could go straight into the ignition phase as the signal on line A goes low.If it desired to ensure that capacitor 38 cen be discharged by the reset push button 119 only after the end of the lock out period, then a suitable logic circuit could be included which would inhibit the reset action while the signal on line R was high. The system is switched on when thE thermostat switch 10 opens, and the capacitor then discharge. Diode 56 provides protection for the input circuitry of gate 43 when the voltage on line 36 collapses and the positive plate of capacitor 38 tries to go more positive than line 35. Gates 77 and 84 have their input circuitry similarly protected by diodes 120 and 121, respectively. In the above described system the signals on lines A andB for inhibiting the TRIACs drive separate transistors 93 and 112. If desired, a single transistor could be used with appropriate gating circuitry receiving the signals on lines A and B. Although TRInCs have ben ucd in the above circuitry to switch the solenoid valve etc., other solid stte switching devices for example silicon controlled rectifiers could be used with appropriate circuitry.The described system has, apart from the thermostat switch and the manual reset, no mechanical contacts or moving parts. The switches and their drive circuits, and the logic timing circuits, are all based on solidstate devices.
