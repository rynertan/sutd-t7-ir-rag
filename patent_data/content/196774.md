# Apparatus for applying liquids to yarns.

## Abstract
Apparatus for applying liquid to a running yarn 12 in a textile machine comprises a hollow body 28 providing a manifold 20 for the liquid and an elongate tube 33 extending horizontally across the manifold 20 . The tube 33 is retained to a bore 32 in the body 28 by a yarn guide 29 which is detachably secured to the body 28 and the bore in tube 33 communicates with a groove yarn path 38 provided by the yarn guide 29 via a bore 31 in the yarn guide 29 of larger diameter than the bore in the tube 33 . The constant supply of liquid to the yarn 12 is provided by the controlled flow of liquid along the tube 33 whose length is at least 100 times the diameter of the bore therein. A height adjustable weir 17 in a liquid supply tank 16 supplies liquid to the manifold 20 at a predetermined pressure. The yarn path 38 has a plurality of yarn contact points 39, 40 to ensure complete application of liquid by the yarn 12 .
