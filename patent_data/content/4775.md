# MICROPROCESSOR INCLUDING A PLURALITY OF COMMUNICATION PROCESSORS

## Abstract
The invention relates to a microprocessor designed specifically for use in a homogeneous computing system. The microprocessor has a memory 20 , a main processing unit 30 for performing arithmetic and logic operations, and a plurality of communication processors P₀ to P₁₁ controlling the communication between the different microprocessors in a system. The communication processors P₀ to P₁₁ are controlled by programmes so that a set of communication processors P₄ to P₁₁ can selectively be controlled to provide either a plurality of serial inputs outputs or the communication processors P₄ to P₁₁ of the set collectively to provide a parallel interface.
