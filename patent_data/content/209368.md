## Description
The present invention relates to an apparatus for cooling high temperature particles or lumps of material and in particular to an apparatus for air cooling high temperature clinker in a cement burning process or for cooling high temperature particles in a process of burning or sintering steel, lime stone or alumina. The invention is concerned with such apparatus of the type including a first cooling zone comprising a substantially vertical guide tube which temporarily accommodates the particles, a conical or pyramidal body which has a plurality of air passages formed therein and is disposed below the guide tube with its vertex substantially coaxial with the guide tube and an acceleration device which has a plurality of air passages formed therein and which extends from the conical or pyramidal body coaxially into said guide tube and is vertically reciprocable to facilitate radially outward displacement of the particles on the conical or pyramidal body, and a second cooling zone of packed layer type disposed below the first cooling zone for further cooling the particles while they move downwards. Japanese Patent Applications Nos. 2226 1983 and 2227 1983 laid open under Nos.128243 1984 and 128244 1984 respectively disclose a cooling apparatus which overcomes the problems encountered in conventional grate type coolers for air cooling high temperature cement clinker. Such a cooling apparatus is illustrated in Figures 8 and 9 which are a part sectional diagrammatic elevation and an enlarged fragmentary view, respectively. The apparatus includes a first cooling zone 31 in which high temperature particles such as cement clinker are air quenched, a second cooling zone 32 disposed below the first cooling zone 31 in which the cement clinker which has been quenched in the first cooling zone 31 is gradually cooled and a rotary kiln 33 for burning cement. The first cooling zone 31 includes a vertical guide tube 34 at its inlet which is adapted to temporarily hold high temperature cement clinker and to prevent it from being rapidly spread radially outwards. A conical or pyramidal body 35 with a large number of air distributing holes and an angle of inclination less than the angle of repose is disposed coaxially with the guide tube 34 and spaced from it. An acceleration device 36 is vertically movable between the top of the pyramidal body 35 and the guide tube 34 and is arranged to accelerate cement clinker on the body 35 radially outwards. An air cooling device 37 supports the vertical guide tube 34 and is adapted to cool its outer surface. The second cooling zone 32 comprising a packed moving bed type cooling device 38 in which rapidly cooled cement clinker is packed into layers which move downwards. Referring particularly to Figure 8, reference numeral 39 designates a control rod for controlling the downward movement of cement clinker 40, a scraper ring 41, a discharge scraper 42, a turntable 43, a conveyor for discharging the cooled cement clinker out of the system 44, a main air supply line for supplying air for cooling the high temperature or first cooling zone 45, a blower 46, an air supply line, for supplying the air for cooling the low temperature or second cooling zone 47, a blower 48, an air compressor 49, a directional control valve 50, an air supply line for supplying air to activate the acceleration device 51, an auxiliary air supply line for supplying air to cool the high temperature zone 52, an air discharge line for discharging air from the acceleration device 53, a valve and 54, an air supply line for supplying combustion air to a calcining furnace. The relationship between the guide tube 34, the pyramidal body 35 and the acceleration device 36 and the construction of the acceleration device 36 are shown in Figure 9. The acceleration device 36 is in the form of a piston which is mounted on a stationary member 55 disposed coaxially with the axis 56 of the guide tube 34 and below the latter and which is vertically slidable with respect to the member 55. The piston comprises a hollow conical head 57 with a large number of holes in it and an outer tube 58 and an inner tube 59 which are integral with the head 57 and define a high pressure chamber 60. The stationary member 55 comprises an inner tube 61 and an outer tube 62. A lower end portion of the inner tube 59 is inserted into the inner tube 61 and the bottom of the outer tube 58 is fitted in an air tight manner over the outer tube 62. The acceleration device 36 is vertically slidable relative to the stationary member 55. The stationary member 55 has an air inlet 63 communicating with the air supply line 50, an air inlet 64 communicating with the auxiliary air supply line 51 and an air outlet communicating with the air discharge line 52. In use, cement clinker 67 is burned in the rotary kiln 33 to a high temperature of about 1350 C and is then fed into the guide tube 34, as indicated by the arrow 68, temporarily remains therein and is then discharged over the conical or pyramidal body 35. Due to the inclination of the conical or pyramidal body 35, the pressure of the air flowing upwards through the air distributing holes, as indicated by the arrows 71, and vertical movement of the acceleration device, the cement clinker is distributed radially outwardly. Whilst flowing radially outwardly over the pyramidal body 35 in the first cooling zone 31, the clinker is rapidly and uniformly cooled to about 950 C by the air flowing upwardly as indicated by the arrows 71. The thus cooled clinker is then fed into the packed moving bed type cooling device 38 which constitutes the second cooling zone 32 and is gradually cooled by the air supplied through the supply line 46. The clinker is then discharged by the conveyor 43 out of the system. The air from the main air supply line 44 is initially at room temperature and flows in the directions indicated by the arrows 69,70,71 and 72 and is heated to about 1050 C and is then used as the combustion air in the rotary kiln 33. The air from the cooling air supply line 46 is initially at room temperature and passes through the cooling device 38 and is heated to about 800 C and then flows into the air supply line 54 for supplying combustion air to the calcination furnace. The compressed air from the compressor 48 is switched by the control valve 49 to flow into the supply line 50 for supplying activating air to the acceleration device or into the auxiliary supply line 51 for supplying cooling air to the high temperature zone. As best seen in Figure 9, the compressed air supplied through the auxiliary cooling air supply line 51 flows through the inlet 64, the inner tube 61 and the inner tube 59 into the interior of the conical head 57. The air then flows out into the guide tube 34, thereby mixing and cooling the cement clinker remaining therein. When compressed air is forced to flow through the air supply line 50 for supplying air to activate the acceleration device, the valve 53 is closed. The compressed air flows from the line 50 into the air inlet 63 and through the space between the inner and outer tubes 61 and 62 to the high pressure chamber 60 from which there is no outlet. As a result, the acceleration device 36 is moved upwardly relative to the stationary member 55. On the other hand, when the supply of compressed air to the line 50 is interrupted while the valve 53 is opened, the compressed air in the high pressure chamber 60 is discharged through the discharge line 52 and the acceleration device 36 is caused to move downwardly by its own weight relative to the stationary member 55. Thus, when the valve 53 is closed to introduce the compressed air through the line 50 into the high pressure chamber 60 and when subsequently the supply of the compressed air to the line 50 is interrupted and the valve 53 is opened, thereby discharging the compressed air from the high pressure chamber 60, the acceleration device 36 is caused to reciprocate vertically relative to the stationary member 55. A small vertical stroke indicated by the lines 57 and 57a is generally sufficient to accelerate the movement of the cement clinker on the conical or pyramidal body 35. However, when a large lump of cement clinker is fed into the guide tube 34, the acceleration device is caused to move down to the position indicated by the line 57b so that the large lump does not pass over the conical or pyramidal body 35 but drops through it directly downwardly and is discharged out of the cooling apparatus through a discharge port not shown at a suitable time. In the apparatus described above, the stability of the moving layer of high temperature particles on the conical or pyramidal body is adversely affected by fluctuations in the flow rate and pressure of the mixing and cooling air flowing through the acceleration device, disturbances in the mixing action in the high temperature particle layer, changes in the pressure distribution between the high temperature particle layers caused by the vertical movement of the motion acceleration device, variation in the particle size distribution of the high temperature particles fed from the rotary kiln, the response of the change in pressure distribution between the layers caused by the drop impact pressure and other variables of high temperature particles in the vertical guide tube. As a result, the whole burning process is adversely affected. Furthermore, in order to remove large and medium lumps in the high temperature particles, the acceleration device is forced to move to the lowermost position. The large and medium lumps thus drop together with the high temperature particles remaining in the guide tube and are removed from the cooling apparatus at a suitable time. However, if there is a high proportion of large and medium lumps in the high temperature particles, they cannot be removed because of the insufficient capacity of the lower storage zone and because of the time required for naturally cooling these lumps, resulting in shutdown of the rotary kiln and the cooling apparatus. The primary object of the present invention is, therefore, to provide an apparatus for cooling high temperature particles in which variable factors in the vertical guide tube will not adversely affect the stability of the moving layer of high temperature particles on conical or pyramidal body. A further object is to provide such an apparatus in which high temperature large and medium lumps in the high temperature particles from the rotary kiln can be crushed while their temperature is still high, whereby the performance of the cooling apparatus can be improved. According to the present invention an apparatus of the type referred to above is characterised in that a substantially vertical outer tube is interposed between the guide tube and the conical or pyramidal body coaxially with the guide tube to constitute together with said guide tube a double guide tube system, the upper end of the outer tube being positioned higher than the lower end of the guide tube so that, in use, the particles form a stable free surface in the annular opening defined between the guide tube and the outer tube, and that the passage through which the particles move between the outer tube and the acceleration device converges, in use, towards a layer thickness control gap defined between the lower end of the outer tube and said conical or pyramidal body. It is preferred that the tube has a plurality of inwardly extending internal projections whose spacing from each other and from the acceleration device is smaller than a predetermined size whereby particles of a size larger than the predetermined size are temporarily retained by the projections and broken into smaller particles while hot by vertical movement of the acceleration device. The inner and outer boundary surfaces of the passage through which the particles move may be defined by the conical or pyramidal body or a protuberance thereon and by the outer tube, respectively. Alternatively, they may be defined by the edges of delay zones in which, in use, the particles are substantially stationary and which are caused by the shape and or configuration of the conical or pyramidal body and the outer tube, respectively. Further features and details of the present invention will be apparent from the following description of certain preferred embodiments which is given with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which The cooling apparatus of Figure 1 is generally similar in overall construction to that described above with reference to Figures 8 and 9. Reference numeral 1 designates a vertical guide tube for temporarily holding high temperature particles, such as high temperature cement clinker discharged from a rotary kiln not shown , and for preventing the rapid spread of the high temperature particles in the radially outward direction 2 designates the axis of the vertical guide tube 1 3, a vertical outer tube which is disposed coaxially below the vertical guide tube 1 and defines together with the vertical guide tube 1 a double wall guide tube 4, a refractory brick or moulding acting as a lining on the inner surfaces of the guide tube 1 and outer tube 3 5, a conical or pyramidal body disposed below the outer tube 3 with its vertex lying on the axis 2 of the guide tube 1 and with an angle of inclination less than the angle of respose, i.e. between 4 and 25 6, air holes formed through the conical or pyramidal body 5 7, an acceleration device which extends from the top of the body 5 into the guide tube 1 and which is vertically movable to accelerate the distribution in the radially outward direction of the particles on the body 5, the top portion of the acceleration device 7 being in the form of a cone while the remainder is in the form of a cylinder 8, air holes formed through the conical head and upper cylindrical wall portion of the acceleration device 7 9, high temperature particles 10, an annular opening defined by the lower circular end of the guide tube 1 and the upper circular end of the outer tube 3 11, the free surface of the high temperature particle layer formed in the annular opening 10 12, the gap which determines the thickness of the particle layer formed between the lower end of the outer tube 3 and the conical or pyramidal body 5 13, arrows indicating the direction of the air flowing through the acceleration device 7 into the guide tube 1, thereby mixing and cooling the high temperature particles remaining therein 14, arrows indicating the direction of the flow of the air for cooling the high temperature particles 9 on the conical or pyramidal body 5 and h, the magnitude of the vertical stroke of the acceleration device 7 in normal operation. The inner surface of the outer tube 3 comprises three conical surfaces concentric with the axis 2 of the guide tube 1 and having respective generating lines, namely a line AB which is inclined downwardly toward the axis 2, a line BC whose upper end merges with the lower end of the line AB in which is inclined away from the axis 2 in the downward direction and a line CD whose upper end merges with the lower end of the line BC and which is inclined downwardly towards the axis 2. Thus the inner surface of the outer tube has a zigzag cross section. Both the angle α of inclination of the line AB and the angle β of inclination of the line BC are significantly larger than the angle of repose and the lines CD and BC are substantially perpendicular to one another. The upper end A of the outer tube 3 is slightly higher than the lower end K of the guide tube 1 so as to prevent the overflow of high temperature particles 9 through the annular opening 10 and to ensure the stable formation of the free surface 11 of the high temperature particles 9. Since the angle α is greater than the angle of repose, the particles 9 in the vicinity of the free surface 11 flow smoothly down along the conical wall surface generated by the line AB. Since the angle β is greater than the angle of repose, the particles 9 are forced against the conical wall surface generated by the line BC. In addition, the conical wall surface generated by the line CD, which is substantially perpendicular to the line BC, serves to prevent the displacement of high temperature particles 9. A tarrying or delay zone 15, in which high temperature particles 9 remain, is thus defined. The particles 9 are displaced along the boundary surface generated by revolution of an arc BD about the axis 2. The gap 12 is defined by a conical surface generated by revolution of a line EF about the axis 2 where E is the lower end of the outer tube 3 and the F is the point on the inclined surface of the conical or pyramidal body 5 at which the line EF is perpendicular to the said surface. Within the gap 12 the body 5 is formed with a cylindrical recess whose axis is coincident with the axis 2. The air for mixing and cooling the high temperature particles 9 remaining in the guide tube 1 is forced to flow through a gap 19 defined between a hole in the bottom 18 of the cylindrical recess and the acceleration device 7 and through the acceleration device 7 itself. The cylindrical wall 17 and the bottom 18 of the cylindrical recess are not formed with any air holes. Thus, a further tarrying or delay zone where the high temperature particles remain is defined, as indicated by numeral 16. Thus, the high temperature particles 9 are displaced along a boundary surface generated by revolution of an arc GH about the axis 2. The angle γ of inclination at the point G of the arc GH is substantially equal to the angle of repose. The two surfaces of revolution generated by revolution of the arcs BD and GH, respectively, about the axis 2 define a passage for the high temperature particles 9 which converges gradually from and below the annular opening 10 toward the layer thickness control gap 12 on the conical surface. Thus a suitable pressure is applied to the particles 9 passing through this passage. Furthermore, the free surface 11 of the high temperature particles 9 in the annular opening 10 prevents disturbances by the various variable factors. As a result, various factors which disturb the stability of the moving layer of high temperature particles on the conical or pyramidal body 5 are substantially eliminated. The advantage of the constitution of the boundary surfaces of the passage by the arcs BD and GH in the high temperature particles resides in the fact that in response to the displacement of the moving layer of particles on the body 5, further high temperature particles 9 are supplied through the gap 12 smoothly and at a predetermined flow rate. Thus, no clogging occurs and wear of the surfaces of the structural parts is substantially avoided. Protective cooling air is forced to flow through the guide tube 1 and the outer tube 3 and a support member shown in Figure 5 and designated 23 . The outer surfaces of the guide tube 1, the outer tube 3 and the support member 23 are lined with refractory bricks or cast material 4 so as to protect their outer surfaces from high temperatures. The second embodiment shown in Figure 2 is substantially similar to the first embodiment. However, in the second embodiment the outer boundary surface of the convergent passage is not constituted by revolution of the arc BD but is a part of the inner wall surface of the outer tube 3. The third embodiment shown in Figure 3 is again generally similar to the first embodiment but the inner boundary surface of the convergent passage is not constituted by revolution of the arc GH, but by the surface of a central protuberance on the conical or pyramidal body 5. The fourth embodiment shown in Figure 4 is again generally similar to the first embodiment and is effectively a combination of the second and third embodiments in that the inner and outer boundary surfaces of the convergent passage are constituted by a protuberance on the body 5 and the outer tube 3, respectively. The fifth embodiment shown in Figures 5 and 6 is constructed to crush large or medium sized lumps 21 of high temperature material. The inner surface of the guide tube 1, which is lined with refractory bricks or moulded material 4 is provided with a ring of circumferentially spaced radially inwardly extending projections 20, as best seen in Figure 6. The spacing between adjacent projections 20 and the spacing between the projections 20 and the acceleration device 7 are smaller than the desired or permissible particle size and than the thickness of the moving layer of the high temperature particles 9 on the conical or pyramidal body 5. The flow of cooling air for protecting the guide tube 1 and the guide tube support member 23 from high temperature and the flows of compressed air for activating the acceleration device 7 are indicated by arrows 22 and 24, respectively. High temperature particles 9 whose size is smaller than the permissible particle size move smoothly down through the guide tube 1, but larger lumps whose size is greater than the permissible size are retained by the projections 20 and thus remain temporarily in the guide tube 1. As the acceleration device 7 reciprocates vertically, its upper leading end strikes the lump 21, thereby breaking it into smaller particles. This can be accomplished easily because the larger lumps 21 are very fragile after being discharged out of the rotary kiln and before they have cooled down. In other words, when the lumps cool down their strength substantially increases and it is therefore advantageous to break them into smaller particles while still hot. The crushed particles whose size is smaller than the predetermined size move down through the guide tube 1 onto the conical or pyramidal body 5 and are there cooled by the air. The sixth embodiment shown in Figure 7 is similar to the fifth embodiment. The acceleration device 7 comprises an inner tube 25 and an outer tube 26 which is movable relative thereto. In use, the acceleration device 7 performs a double action whereby the outer tube 26 moves upwardly whereafter the inner tube 25 moves upwardly a distance H. The inner tube then moves down again and the outer tube then returns to its original position. This is found to be particularly efficient since the inner tube breaks the large lumps and the outer tube then accelerates them outwardly. The vertical stroke H of the acceleration device 7 is longer than the stroke h of the acceleration device 7 of Figure 5 so that oversize lumps are more easily broken into smaller particles. In the apparatus in accordance with the present invention, the guide tube and the outer tube between the guide tube and the conical or pyramidal body coaxially of the guide tube constitute a double guide tube system. The high temperature particles form a free surface in the annular opening between the guide tube and the outer tube. Therefore, part of the air which flows through the acceleration device to mix and cool the high temperature particles remaining in the guide tube is not directed towards the moving particle layer on the conical or pyramidal body, but is directed toward the annular opening. The upper end of the outer tube is slightly higher than the lower end of the guide tube so that the influence of a decrease in the angle of repose of the high temperature particles due to the air flow for mixing and cooling the high temperature particles in the guide tube is prevented and consequently the free surface can be maintained stable. The passage for the high temperature particles defined in the outer tube gradually converges towards the layer thickness control gap defined between the lower end of the outer tube and the conical or pyramidal body so that an optimum pressure is exerted on the particles as they move toward the layer thickness control gap. As a result, various factors which tend to disturb the stability of the particle layer formed on the conical or pyramidal body are substantially eliminated because the free surface of the particles in the annular opening exhibits a stabilising effect. In a preferred embodiment, the guide tube has a plurality of radially inwardly extending projections whose spacing from each other and from the acceleration device is less than a predetermined permissible size so that the cross sectional area of the particle passages defined in the guide tube are smaller than the said predetermined size. Therefore, particles whose size is smaller than the predetermined size are permitted to drop freely through the guide tube, but lumps whose size is greater than the predetermined size are retained temporarily on the projections in the guide tube and are then broken into smaller particles when the upper end of the motion acceleration edvice, which is vertically reciprocable, strikes them while still hot. Thus, the breakers or the like which are essential in the above described conventional grate type cooler can be eliminated.
