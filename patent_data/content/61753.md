# Electric sleep inducer.

## Abstract
An electric sleep inducer comprises for acceleration of sleep induction and for avoidance of photopsia, galvanic sensation and other complications for the testee a control circuit arranged to produce a therapeutic wave form output which is applied at frequencies controlled non stepwise to gradually decrease from 14 Hz to 0 Hz and adapted to a sleeping electroencephalogram and cathode and anode conductor elements for applying the therapeutic wave form output of the control circuit to the head. Pulses of 0.2 to 0.5 msec and 3 to 4 V are applied by an anode conductor element to the occiput and a cathode conductor element to the sinciput of the testee the therapeutic wave form output is applied by repeated three minutes cycles until 30 or 60 minutes, the therapeutic wave form output being characte rized by phases of constant frequency value.
