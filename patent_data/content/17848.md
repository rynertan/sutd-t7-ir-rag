# Rate adaptive pacemaker.

## Abstract
An improved automatically rate adaptive pacemaker, wherein the rate of delivered stimulus pulses is controlled as a function of sensed heartbeat characteristics and or patient threshold. The pacemaker analyzes different cha racteristics or parameters of the detected heartbeat signal 82 89 , and the rate of delivered stimulus pulses is con trolled as a function of predetermined correlation factors. The pacemaker includes means 101, 102 for automatic threshold tracking, and also for adjusting the rate of deli vered stimulus pulses as a continuous function of the pa tient threshold 95, 60, 59 .
