## Description
Title Direction Indicator Cancellation DeviceThis invention relates to devices for automatic cancellation of direction indication signals, particularly in or for motor vehicles.This function is currently carried out by mechanical devices with a reasonable degree of reliability and at no inconsiderable expense. The use of mechanical devices does mean that there is a risk of unreliability creeping in as wear of the moving and interacting parts takes place, as well as the need for preventive maintenance.There is an increasing use of electronics in vehicles and many functions previously achieved with electro mechanical devices are now being implemented purely electronically.Electronic control of direction indicators offers many advantages, for example a flash rate which is independant of the power load of the lamps. To complement the reliability of electronic systems, there is a need for an arrangement to cancel the indicators from the steering column and which avoidS the inherent problems of the mechanical device currently employed. Such a new arrangement should interface directly with electronic circuits, be as inherently reliable as those circuits and be cheap and simple to manufacture. Magnetically operated reed switches provide highly reliable, high speed, long life switch elements. In addition they can be operated, using a permanent magnet, without any physical contact between the switch and the operating mechanism.If one or more permanent magnets are mounting on a rotating part of the vehicle steering column they can be used to trigger stationery reed switches around the periphery.By particular arrangements of the magnets and reeds, specific sequences of reed operation will be generated to determine the direction of rotation of the steering wheel. These specific sequences can then be processed by suitable electronics, e.g. in the form of integrated circuits, and used to cancel a previously selected direction indicator flash sequence at the appropriate time.In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a cancellation device for a direction indication signal comprising a series of magnetic reed switches arranged in proximity to a steering column, means movable with the rotation of the steering column to cause the reed switches to operate in one order as the column is rotated in one direction and in the opposite order as the column is rotated in the other direction, and circuitry to detect the order in which the reed switches are operated and to cancel a turn signal as appropriate. The reed switches may be operated by one or more permanent magnets mounted in a magnet carrier of non magnetic material rotatable with the steering column.Flux concentrators may be arranged between the reed switches to shield them from stray magnetic fields.Alternatively, the reed switches may each be associated with a static permanent magnet and the steering column may carrying a shield to isolate or expose the reed switches from or to their associated magnets in a sequential manner.The invention will be further described with reference to the accompanying diagrammatic drawings, in which Figure 1 is a sectional view across the steering column showing one arrangement of reed switches to form a device in accordance with the invention Figure 2 is a similar view showing an alternative arrangement Figure 3 is a similar view showing a further alternative arrangement Figure 4 is a similar view showing yet a further alternative arrangement andFigure 5 is an elevation of the arrangement of figure 4. Figure 1 shows permanent magnets 3, 4 and 5 mounted on and rotatable with a steering column 1 by means of a magnet carrier 2. As the steering column 1 rotates it passes the magnets 3, 4 and 5 over the reed switches 7, 8 and 9, which close in response to the magnetic field of the permanent magnets. The reed switches close sequentially. For example from the position shown in Figure 1, if the steering column rotates clockwise magnet 5 closes the reed switches in the order 9, 8 and 7. If the steering column rotates counter clockwise magnet 4 closes the reed switches in the order 7, 8 and 9.The reed switches are mounted on some fixed part not shown in Figure 1 adjacent to the steering column, for example by the use of a printed circuit board 6. The magnet carrier would be manufactured from a non magnetic material.Under certain conditions the simple system of magnets and reed switches may not give the required switching. For example with the magnet between two reed switches they could both be closed. This may not be desirable for the operation of the electronics. For these circumstances, magnetic flux concentrators 10, 11, 12 and 13 are placed between the reed switches. These may be simple pieces of ferromagnetic wire or more complex sheets or laminates of ferromagnetic material . By concentrating the stray magnetic flux frown the permanent magnets the angular movement of the steering column over which any particular reed is closed can be considerably reduced. By this method a break before make action between reed switches can be provided.The field strengths of the magnets and the operating field strength of the reed swithces are of course closely related.The particular application will dictate the necessary values for these parameters. Similarly the configuration, size and material of the magnetic flux concentrators will be dictated by the field strengths employed and the switching action required. Specific values for any of these parameters cannot be given.Figure 1 shows one particular configuration for magnets and reed with respect to the steering column. Many such configurations are possible. Some alternative configurationis are shown in figures 2 to 5.For instance figure 2 shows an arrangement in which four reed switches 22 are mounted on a printed circuit board 25 mounted so as to surround the steering column 1. As illustrated a pair of magnets 3 are mounted on the carrier 2 at spacings of 1200 and 240 to give distinctive patterns of operation depending on the direction of rotation.In figures 1 and 2 the reed switches are in a plane generally normal to the steering column axis.Figure 3 shows an arrangement in which the reed switches 22 are arranged with their axes parallel with the steering column axis.The arrangements of figures 1, 2 and 3 rely on stationary reed switches and moving magnets.In the arrangement of figures 4 and 5 each reed switch 22 is mounted on a printed circuit board 25 associated with a static permanent magnet 3. The steering column 1 carries a shield 26 to isolate the reed switches sequentially from the associated magnets to open the reed switches as the steering column rotates in one direction or the other.In an alternative arrangement the shield may extend substantially around the circumference of the steering column and have one or more windows to allow closure of the reed switches. The use of magnetic reed switches circumvents the problems of making reliable contact to a rotating switch mechanism.Also the problems of mechanical wear are eliminated because there is no physical contact between moving and stationary parts of the system. The long life and inherent reliability of the sealed element magnet reed switch is maintained.Various modifications may be made within the scope of the invention. For instance, in the figure 2 arrangement, there could be two magnets at 1800 displacement and three reed switches, or three magnets spaced at 120 and four magnets spaced at 9O. The greater the number of magnets and reeds the greater the angular resolution but in all cases the numerical relationship between magnets and reeds must be odd.
