# Pulse combustor.

## Abstract
A pulse combustor has a main body 12 in which a cylin drical mixing chamber 16 and a combustion chamber 14 are formed. An air inlet port 40 and a fuel inlet port 42 are formed in the body to open into the mixing chamber. These inlet ports are located on the same circumference of the inner periphery of the mixing chamber and spaced from each other. An air supply pipe 18 for introducing air into the mixing chamber is connected at one end to the air inlet port, and supply pipe 20 for introducing fuel gas into the mixing chamber is connected at one end to the fuel inlet port. The air supply pipe extends in a predetermined direction so as to cause the air introduced into the mixing chamber to flow while rotating in one direction along the inner periphery of the mixing chamber. The fuel supply pipe extends in a predeter mined direction to cause the fuel to be introduced into the mixing chamber along a direction opposite the direction in which the air rotates.
