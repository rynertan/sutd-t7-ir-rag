# Ultrasonic liquid ejecting apparatus.

## Abstract
An ultrasonic liquid ejecting apparatus comprises a housing including a chamber 12 for holding liquid therein having an intake port connected to a liquid supply container. A bimorph vibrator system is provided comprising a vibrat ing member 13 secured to the housing in pressure transmitting relation with the liquid in the chamber and a piezoelectric transducer 14 secured to the vibrating mem ber for inducing a displacement therein to discharge a small quantity of liquid through an nozzle opening formed in the vibrating member. A circuit 90, 51, 52 is provided for exciting the transducer at a frequency corresponding to the resonant frequency of the virator system.
