# Apparatus for projecting and exposing a photomask pattern onto re exposing substrates.

## Abstract
A method and an apparatus for projecting and exposing a photomask pattern 2 of a master mask 101 onto a plurality of re exposing substrates 5 using first and second position ing marks provided on the master mask 101 and on a stan dard marker substrate 107 , respectively, and a condensing optical system 35 for optically aligning the mounting posi tions of the master mask 101 and the re exposing substrate 5 and exposing the photomask pattern onto the re exposing substrate, the master mask and the re exposing substrate being placed at conjugate points of the condensing optical system 35 alignment scope means 31 are provided for detecting any deviation between images of the first and second positioning marks to perform an alignment of the carriage 32 supporting the optical system, the arrangement allowing an inspection of the alignment to be performed dur ing exposure of the re exposing substrate.
