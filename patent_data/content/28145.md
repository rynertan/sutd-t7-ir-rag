# Pressure compensated steering system.

## Abstract
A pair of steering cylinders 10, 12 are selectively supplied with pressurized fluid from a source 6 in depen dence upon the setting of a pressure compensated steering valve 20 as determined by means of a hand pump 70 operated from a steering wheel 5 . To avoid problems of so called jerk steering associ ated with such systems, and without requiring provision of a feedback system between the articulated portion of the vehicle and the steering valve actuating means 26, 28 , internal passageways 36, 39, 40, 45 are provided within the spool 24 for placing end cap actuators 26, 28 in restricted fluid communication with a low pressure reservoir 8 whenever the spool 24 is displaced from its neutral posi tion in response to the admission of pressurized fluid to one of the actuators 26, 28 so that, upon cessation of the input to the respective actuator from hand pump 70 , the actuators 26, 28 slowly drain to reservoir 8 , thereby per mitting spool 24 slowly to return to its neutral position under the action of spring 32 .
