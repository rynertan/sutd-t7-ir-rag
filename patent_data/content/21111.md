# High temperature heat exchanger.

## Abstract
A high temperature tube and shell heat exchanger includes a plurality of tube sheets 22, 24, 26 dividing the interior of the shell into consecutive chambers. Ceramic tubes 28 are mounted to one tube sheet 22 by hemispherical seats 32 and extend through loosely fitting porous inserts 54 in openings in the other tube sheets 24, 26 . A hot contaminated fluid flows from the chamber 36 through the ceramic tubes, a cool fluid flows through the chamber 42 across the tubes, and a third sealing fluid is injected into an intermediate chamber 48 at a pressure higher than that of the fluid mediums in the adjacent chambers and, flowing through the porous inserts and into the other chambers, forms a dynamic seal which also allows axial motion and limited lateral motion of the tubes.
