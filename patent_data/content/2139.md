# Nerve growth factor and process for obtaining it.

## Abstract
A new form of nerve growth factor having a molecular weight of about 116,000 and which is stable in dilute aqueous solutions is obtained from mouse submandibular gland or mouse saliva. An extract of mouse submandibular gland or mouse saliva is subjected to ionexchange chromatography to recover a component of the gland or saliva rich in the nerve growth factor and containing proteinaceous material which does not degrade the nerve growth factor. The pure nerve growth factor is obtained by subjecting the component rich in nerve growth factor to at least one additional chromatography step, usually two to four, to recover pure nerve growth factor having a molecular weight of about 116,000. The pure nerve growth factor and its stable mixture with proteinaceous material function as a plasminogen activator to convert plasminogen to plasmin, and this is useful for the lysis of blood clots.
