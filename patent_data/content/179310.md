# Trinary interface for binary logic.

## Abstract
A communications interface for transferring data from a first binary logic circuit 11 to a second binary logic circuit 12 by using a trinary logic transmission channel. The first set of binary logic signals is converted into a first set of binary control signals which, in turn, control trinary drivers 18 con nected to the transmission channel. The trinary drivers drive the transmission channel to one of three discrete voltage levels as opposed to one of two levels in binary systems. Trinary receivers 21 are located on the second binary logic circuit and are connected to the trinary transmission channel. The receivers produce a second set of binary control signals which are translated into a second set of binary logic signals for use by the second binary logic circuit.
