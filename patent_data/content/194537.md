## Description
APPARATUS AND SYSTEM FOR PRODUCING WIRE MARKERSFIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to wire markers for identifying discrete electrical conductors and pertains more particularly to improved apparatus and system for producing wire markers in diverse formats and in sequence without need for continued operator attention.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Various apparatus is presently commercially available for the production of adhesively backed strips of tape bearing identification, through alphanumeric indicia, uniquely identifying the ends of conductors of a multiconductor cable harness for facilitating precise connection of conductors thereof to user apparatus. In one version of such apparatus, made commercially available by the assignee hereof, a commercially available calculator is modified such that keyboard entries therein give rise to permanent impressions through the calculator printer on wire marking substrates fed thereto as printing tape. In use of the reference apparatus, an operator enters alphanumeric data into the keyboard, along with format information with respect to the number of columns of data desired in the marker and then simply prints the entered information on the printing substrate by operation of the printing key. Continuous operator input is required in the referenced apparatus for the production of wire markers in plural number having respective diverse indicia. While the idenfified commercial device has found acceptance in the marketplace, its requirement for continuous operator input has rendered same less than desirably effective.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention has, as its primary object the provision of improved wire marker production apparatus and system. A more particular object of the invention is the provision of apparatus and system for the production of wire markers of diverse indicia content with heightened operator unattended production thereof. In the attainment of the foregoing and other objects, the invention provides apparatus for the printing of wire markers inclusive of keyboard means for the input of operator information indicative of alphanumeric content, column format and selective permutation characteristics of wire markers, display means for visual presentation to the operator of operator selected wire marker content, format and prompt information with respect to the selective permutation characteristics, printer means responsive to operator key input for the printing of wire markers with such content in such format and with the selected permutation characteristics, and controller means connected to the foregoing units for effecting the printing of plural diverse wire markers responsively to a operator printing input. The foregoing and other objects and features of the invention will be further understood from the following detailed discussion of preferred embodiments and practices in accordance with the invention and from the drawings wherein like reference numerals identify like parts throughout.DESCRIPTION OF THEvDRAWINGS Fig 1. is a plan elevational view of wire marker apparatus in accordance with the invention. Fig. 2 is a system block diagram of apparatus in accordance with the invention. Fig. 3 is a general flow chart of practice in accordance with the invention. Fig. 4 is a flow chart indicative of the preferred keyboard routine of the invention. Fig. 5 is a flow chart indicative of the preferred print routine of the invention. Fig. 6 is a flow chart particularizing the steps of the automated sequencing routine of the invention. Fig. 7 is a flow chart showing the steps of a sequence table search practice of the invention.DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS AND PRACTICES Referring to Fig. l, wire marker apparatus 17 in acordance with the invention comprises a portable, self powered console unit 18 containing a keyboard 19, inclusive of character keys 20 in a plurality which may contain both alphabetic and numeric alphanumeric keys and function keys 21 in a plurality which may include clear keyboard key CL, clear entry key CE, program select key PR, paper feed key PF, print key PT, a cursor left movement key and a cursor right movement key. Display 22 may be an LCD liquid crystal display unit and provides communication as between an operator and apparatus 17 as to character entries, spacing and function entries, prompts and responses by the operator. Printer 23 may be a typical dot matrix printer and its output impressions are applied to wire marker tape 24, which is fed from its spool 26 by a suitable drive motor not shown . In use of the Fig. 1 apparatus, as will be more fully understood from the discussion below of the program implemented by the microprocessor chip controller of the apparatus responsively to operator keyboard input, the operator first outlines the marker printing project at hand. The project will, within the capabilities of the apparatus of the invention, call for identification of the number of columns of data to be presented on the marker COLUMN SELECT , the number of markers to be produced or printed QUANTITY SELECT , the number of printed lines per marker PRINTED LINES SELECT , the number of unprinted lines per marker UNPRINTED LINES SELECT , and the sequencing procedure AUTO SEQUENCE OR NOT to be applied in marker production or printing. The operator will also have at hand the character information for the initial wire marker to be printed. By way of example of system configuration and operator performance, an operator may opt for any one of the following COLUMN SELECT one column, two columns, three columns or four columns QUANTITY SELECT any number of markers may be printed PRINTED LINES SELECT typically, the marker has eight lines, any number may be selected for printing UNPRINTED LINES SELECT given the marker length, unprinted lines are selected in number equal to the difference between the printed lines selected and the marker length and AUTO SEQUENCE OR NOT. Typically, for printing of diverse marker content, auto sequence is selected, whereby a given digit of each column of data is to be advanced sequentially per printed marker. Referring now to Fig. 2, the system underlying the wire marker apparatus of Fig. 1 is shown in block diagram form and includes keyboard 19, display 22, printer 23 and controller 28, which may be a suitably programmed microprocessor of current chip variety. The keyboard furnishes output signals indicative of key selection to controller 28 on line 30 and the controller furnishes various prompt and other information to display 22 over line 32. Controiler 28 applies motor control signals to line 34a and printing intelligence signals to line 34b, both of which are connected to printer 23 for operation thereof. Printer status is made known to controller 28 over printer output line 36. The overall program for operation of apparatus 17 is depicted in the flow chart of Fig. 3, to which reference is now had. Operation commences at START step 38 and a wire marker spool is placed in apparatus 10 and by step 40, PAPER ADVANCE , is advanced into position for printing thereon. In step 42, FORMAT PHASE , the program enters the function selection and setup activity. This is brought on by operator depression of the program key PR, which now multiplexes certain keys of the alphanumeric keyboard.By way of example, keys A, C, L, Q and S are selected to provide their alphabetic information to controller 28 in the absence of preceding operation of the program key, but when operated sequentially to operation of the program key, to bring on auto sequencing A key , column selection C key , printed line select L key , quantity select 0 key and unprinted line select S key . In step 44, AUTO SEQUENCING, controller 28 inquires as to whether the A key was operated following depression of the program key. If the inquiry is answered in the affirmative, indication of same is stored in step 46, STORE AUTO SEQUENCING YES . If negative reply, the program steps directly to step 48,.bypassing step 46. In step 48, NUMBER OF COLUMNS , which is also reached from step 46, the controller inquires as to whether the C key was operated successively to depression of the program key. If positive answer, a prompt is given to the operator as to entry of the selection number one, two, three or four , and the selection is stored in step 50, STORE COLUMNSSELECTION . The program advances directly to step 52, NUMBER OF PRINTED LINES PER MARKER.Inquiry is made in step 52 as to whether the L key was operated in sequence to depression of the program key. If so, the controller prompts the operator as to entry of his selection and stores same in step 54, STORE NUMBER OF PRINTED LINESSELECTION . If the answer to step 52 is negative, advance is made to step 55, NUMBER OF UNPRINTED LINES PERMARKER. Inquiry is made in step 55 as to whether the S key was operated in sequence to depression of the program key.If so, the controller prompts the operator as to entry of his selection and stores same in step 56, STORE NUMBER OFUNPRINTED LINES SELECTION . If the reply to the step 55 inquiry is negative, the program advances directly to step 57, QUANTITY OF MARKERS TO BE PRINTED . Inquiry is made in step 57 as to whether the Q key was operated in sequence to depression of the program key. If so, the controller prompts the operator as to entry of his selection and stores same in step 58, QUANTITY OF MARKERSTO BE PRINTED . If the answer to step 57 is negative, the program advances directly to step 60, GOTO KEYBOARDCONSULT AND BUFFER SPACE ENTRY ROUTINE, which is set forth in Fig. 4. Discussion preliminary to coverage of this routine is now set forth. Table 1 below indicates an example of a character buffer in accordance with the invention and the space blank entries per wire markers of the several varieties above noted, i. e., of one, two, three or four column type.The numerals 1 through 16 identify character space positions in the character buffer. Letters X and 0 represent respective character and space entries. TABLE 1 CHARACTER BUFFER 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16ONE COLUMN MARKER X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X TWO COLUMN MARKERX X X X X X X O O X X X X X X XTHREE COLUMN MARKERX X X X O O X X X X O O X X X XFOUR COLUMN MARKERX X X O X X X O O X X X O X X X Referring to Fig.4, step 62 calls for an entry into KEYBOARD CONSULT AND BUFFER SPACE ENTRY ROUTINE . In step 64, GET KEY SIGNAL , controller 28 scans the keyboard for an entry. Controller 28 inquires as to whether the key signal obtained is a program key in step 66, PROGRAMKEY . If the inquiry is affirmatively answered, the program directs activity to the format phase in step 68, GOTO FORMAT PHASE . On negative reply to the step 66 inquiry, step 70, ONE COLUMN, is practiced, asking whether the stored column selection is one column.Upon negative reply to the step 70 inquiry, the program advances to step 72, GOTO TWO COLUMNS, requiring further inquiry prior to character buffer entry. If the answer to the step 70 inquiry is affirmative, i. e.r that the stored column selection is a single column, the program moves to step 74, ENTER SIGNAL INTO BUFFER .Inquiry is now made in step 76 as to whether the character buffer is complete in entry, BUFFER FULL. If this inquiry is answered in the negative, the program proceeds to step 78, GOTO GET KEY SIGNAL , in its continuance of character buffer loading. If the inquiry is answered in the positive, the program proceeds to step 80, AWAIT PRINTKEY SIGNAL . In the event that the stored column selection was not one column in the step 70 inquiry, the program proceeds through step 72 to the inquiry of step 82, TWO COLUMNS . If the answer to this inquiry is negative, i. e., that stored column selection is three or even four columns, the program steps to step 84, GOTO THREE COLUMNS . On positive answer to the step 82 inquiry, advance is made to step 86, MUST ENTER TWO SPACES IN BUFFER FOLLOWING SEVENTHBUFFER ENTRY. This accommodates the spacing requirement for two column markers in Table 1 above, per step 88, ENTER SIGNAL SPACE INTO BUFFER . Step 90 inquires as to buffer content, BUFFER FULL , and negative answer calls for step 94, GOTO GET KEY SIGNAL. If the answer is positive, the program advances to step 96, AWAIT PRINT KEYSIGNAL. In the event that the stored column selection was not two columns, the program proceeds, to the inquiry of step 98, THREE COLUMNS . If the answer to this inquiry is negative, i. e., that stored column selection is four columns, the program steps to step 100, GOTO FOURCOLUMNS . On positive answer to the step 98 inquiry, advance is made to step 102, MUST ENTER TWO SPACES AFTERFOURTH AND TENTH BUFFER ENTRIES. This accommodates the spacing requirement for three column markers in Table 1 above, per step 104, ENTER SIGNAL SPACE INTO BUFFER . Step 106 inquires as to buffer content, BUFFER FULL , and negative answer calls for step 108, GOTO GET KEY SIGNAL.If the answer is positive, the program advances to step 110 AWAIT PRINT KEY SIGNAL In the event that the stored column selection was not three columns, the program proceeds to the inquiry of step 112, FOUR COLUMNS . If the answer to this inquiry is negative, a return is made in step 113 to step 62. On positive answer to the step 112 inquiry, advance is made to step 114, MUST ENTER ONE SPACE AFTER THIRD AND TWELFTHBUFFER ENTRIES AND TWO SPACES AFTER SEVENTH BUFFER ENTRY. This accommodates the spacing requirement for four column markers in Table 1 above, per step 116, ENTER SIGNAL SPACEINTO BUFFER Step 118 inquires as to buffer content, BUFFER FULL , and negative answer calls for step 122, GOTOGET KEY SIGNAL. If the answer is positive, the program advances to step 124, AWAIT PRINT KEY SIGNAL. Turning now to Fig.5, operation of the print key brings on step 126, PRINT ROUTINE PRINT SPECIFIED NUMBEROF PRINTED AND UNPRINTED LINES PER MABKER , and entry into the marker printing phase. Initial inquiry is made as to whether the system has completed printing of the past marker in step 128, DONE PRINTING MARKER . If the inquiry is answered in the negative, cycling takes place in step 128. Otherwise, the program proceeds to step 130, GOTO AUTO SEQUENCE ROUTINE . An outset inquiry in that routine, covered below, is as to whether auto sequencing has been selected. Assuming the negative, or completion of auto sequencing, practice then proceeds to step 132, ISMARKER PRINT QUANTITY MET . If negative, practice advances to step 134, DECREMENT MARKER QUANTITY , and return is had to step 12S above.If the answer is positive, the program advances to step 136, GOTO KEYBOARD ROUTINE The auto sequencing routine is shown in Fig. 6, and is entered in step 138, AUTO SEQUENCE ROUTINE. The outset inquiry, aboveireferred to, is set forth in step 140, YESAUTO SEQUENCING SELECTION. If the answer is negative, the program advances to step 142, RETURN . On positive answer, step 144 is practiced, namely, SET POSITIONPOINTER TO CHARACTER 16 . Departure is now made to the subroutine of Fig. 7, covered below, to modify a character single column marker or plural characters multiple column marker of the character buffer for automated seqentially numbered markers, i. e., through step 146, GOTO SEQUENCE TABLE SEARCH .Upon completion of this search, which sequences the sixteenth character in the buffer to its next value, practice advances to step 148, GET THE NUMBER OF COLUMNS SELECTED , and then to step 150, IS IT A ONE COLUMN MARKER . If the answer is positive, the program advances to step 152, TRANSFER BUFFER CONTENTTO LCD DISPLAY . In this step, the marker print characters are displayed and printed on a wire marker. The system then effects a RETURN in step 154. If the reply to the step 150 inquiry was negative, practice proceeds to step 156, IS IT A TWO COLUMN MARKER. If this inquiry is affirmatively answered, the program proceeds to step 158, IS POSITION POINTERLESS THAN 8 . It will be recalled that the sixteenth character was above advanced in sequence by the setting of the position pointer to such character. Accordingly, the reply to this inquiry will be in the negative, and practice proceeds to step 160, SET POSITION POINTER TO CHARACTER 7 . This step leads to the sequencing of the seventh buffer character in step 162, GOTO SEQUENCE TABLE SEARCH .Step 164, GOTO STEP 15 2 , is practiced, either following step 162, or directly upon affirmative answer to the inquiry of step 158. If the answer to the step 156 inquiry was negative, i.e., the stored marker column was more than two columns, the program proceeds at that point directly to step 164, ISIT A THREE COLUMN MARKER. If the answer here is affirmative, advance is made to the inquiry of step 166, IS POSITION POINTER LESS THAN 11 . With the pointer at character sixteen, the answer is negative and step 168 is practiced, SET POSITION POINTER TO CHARACTER 10 . Sequence information is obtained for the tenth character in the buffer in step 170, GOTO SEQUENCE TABLE SEARCH .Inquiry is now made in step 172, IS POSITION POINTERLESS THAN 5 . In the practice under discussion, the answer is negative and the program proceeds to step 174, SETPOSITION POINTER TO CHARACTER 4 . Sequence information is obtained for the fourth character in the buffer in step 176, GOTO SEQUENCE TABLE SEARCH . If the response to the inquiry in step 164 was negative, i. e., a four column marker is to be printed, the program steps from step 164 to step 178, IS POSITIONPOINTER LESS THAN 13 . With the pointer at character sixteen,.the answer is negative and advance is made to step 180, SET POSITION POINTER TO CHARACTER 12 . Sequence information is now obtained for the twelfth character in step 182, GOTO SEQUENCE TABLE SEARCH . Inquiry is next made in step 184, IS POSITION POINTER LESS THAN 8 .With negative reply, twelve being greater than eight, advance is made to step 186, SET POSITION POINTER TOCHARACTER 7 . Sequence information for the seventh character is obtained in step 188, GOTO SEQUENCE TABLESEARCH . Inquiry is next made in step 190, IS POSITIONPOINTER LESS THAN 4 . With negative reply, eight being greater than four, advance is made to step 192, SETPOSITION POINTER TO CHARACTER 3 . Sequence information for the seventh character is obtained in step 194, GOTOSEQUENCE TABLE SEARCH . The returns to step 152 for display and printing will be seen to occur following steps 162, 176 and 194, respectively for two, three and four column markers. The sequencing phase of operation flows from an offset relation between buffer character values and assigned sequence data, such as is shown below in Table 2. TABLE 2 VALUE DATA 0 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 6 7 7 8 8 9 9 0The DATA 0 bit is set high to indicate overflow. The sequence phase is entered in step 196, SEQUENCETABLE SEARCH ROUTINE , of Fig. 7. The outset step consults the character buffer for a character to be sequenced, per the above positioning of the position pointer step 198 GET THE CHARACTER FROM THE BUFFER . Inquiry is made as to whether the character is an information entry or not in step 200, IS IT A SPACE CHARACTER . If affirmative, the position pointer is decremented in step 202, DECREMENTTHE POSITION POINTER . Inquiry is now made as to whether there are no more characters in the buffer in step 204, END OF BUFFER REACHED . If yes, a RETURN is made in step 206. Otherwise, another character is obtained. If a negative reply applies as to the step 200 inquiry, practice advances to step 208 for indexing the sequence table Table 2 above , SET INDEX INTO SEQUENCETABLE . A value from the sequence table is obtained from the index setting in step 210, GET A VALUE FROM THESEQUENCE TABLE . Inquiry is made as to whether there is a match between the character and the value in step 212, DOES VALUE EQUAL CHARACTER . If no, step 214 advances the sequence table index, POINT THE INDEX TO THE NEXT VALUE . Inquiry is made in step 216, END OF TABLE REACHED . If no, another value is obtained. If yes, a RETURN is made. Where an affirmative answer is provided in step 212, practice advances to step 218, GET THE DATA FROM THESEQUENCE TABLE , and then to step 220, SAVE THE HIGH BIT HIGH BIT INDICATES OVERFLOW . Next, a substitution is made, i. e., of the sequentially higher DATA thus obtained, for the character value, this in step 222, REPLACE THECHARACTER WITH THE DATA IN THE BUFFER . In the event that the high bit was set, which occurs when the value under consideration is nine, need is had to set that value to zero and to increment the immediately leftward character in the buffer, for example where the value is nine and the leftward character is one, the result of sequencing need lead to these characters becoming respectively two and zero. Inquiry as to whether the high bit was set is made in step 224, WAS THE HIGH BIT SET .If no, a RETURN is made in step 226. If yes, practice proceeds to step 228, DECREMENT THE POSITION POINTER . Inquiry is now made in step 230, END OF BUFFER REACHED .If yes, a RETURN is made in step 232. If no, the leftward buffer character is obtained in step 234, GET THECHARACTER FROM THE BUFFER , and the program steps back, in step 236, GOTO 208 , to step 208 for the incrementing of the obtained character. From the foregoing, it will be seen that the invention provides apparatus and system readily operator settable for subsequent, operator unattended production of any desired number of markers in any one of numerous configurations.Various changes in programming practice and modifications to apparatus and system may be introduced without departing from the invention. Thus, the particularly preferred embodiments and practices are intended in an illustrative and not in a limiting sense. The true scope of the invention is set forth in the appended claims.
