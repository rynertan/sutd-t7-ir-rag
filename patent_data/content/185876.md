# AN FET SWITCH FOR HIGH FREQUENCY SIGNALS

## Abstract
A solid state switching network inlcudes three FET switches arranged in a substantially T or inverted T configuration. The network is controlled so that in an OFF or non conducting state two of the FET switches are OFF and one is on. The high OFF impedance of the two FETs work against the low ON impedance of the third FET to provide an open circuit between the input and output of the switching network. The open circuit has greater isolation than is feasible with conventional circuits. The switching network or module is used in several configurations to couple data terminal equipment DTE to a communications highway.
