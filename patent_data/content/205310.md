# Exhaust brake.

## Abstract
A slidable gate assembly is to be mounted on an exhaust brake having a housing 10 with aligned inlet and outlet apertures 13, 14 to allow the passage of exhaust gas through the housing. The flow of exhaust gas is controlled by a slid able valve gate 15 forming part of the slidable gate assembly and having an exhaust gas relief passage 56 therethrough. The valve gate is mounted one end of the piston rod 21 and at that same end there is provided a closure device 60 for opening and closing the exhaust gas relief passage in the valve gate. A basing force applied through the piston rod 21 , preferably by a coil spring 61 , biases the closure device 60 towards a closed condition of the exhaust gas relief passage. The piston rod 21 is movable relative to the valve gate 15 to open the exhaust gas relief passage 56 through the valve gate in dependance upon the force applied by the biasing spring 61 . The closure device is forced to an open condition by the pressure of exhaust gas applied through the exhaust gas relief passage to the closure device. With this construction the basing spring 61 can be located at a position remote from the body of the exhaust brake so as to be operable below the setting temperature of the spring.
