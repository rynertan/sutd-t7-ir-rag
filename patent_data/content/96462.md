# Printing head driving apparatus.

## Abstract
According to this invention, a voltage signal generating circuit 12, 16, 30, 33 generates a voltage signal which is in synchronism with a print timing signal produced when a printing head is driven. A detection circuit 15a, 15b, 16, 30, 33 detects variations in a power source voltage for driving the printing head. A driving pulse outputting circuit 13, 17, 30, 33 is adapted to output a driving pulse signal with a pulse generating timing and pulse width corresponding to variations in the power source voltage, on the basis of the voltage signal output from the voltage signal generating circuit 15a, 15b, 16, 30, 33 and detection signal output from the detection circuit 15a, 15b, 16, 30, 33 . A driving circuit 14, 40 drives the printing head, with the printing timing and printing pressure being based on the driving pulse signal.
