# Ceramic envelope device for high pressure discharge lamp.

## Abstract
A ceramic envelope device for a high pressure metal vapor discharge lamp, including a translucent ceramic tube 12, a pair of electrically conducting end caps 14 closing opposite open ends of the ceramic tube, a pair of opposed discharge electrodes 16 each of which is supported at one end by the inner portion of the corresponding end cap, and a pair of power supply lead members 8 each of which is supported at one end by the outer portion of the correspond ing end cap. To avoid cracking and leakage of the end cap, at least one of the electrodes 16 and the lead members 8 is formed of a twisted wire consisting of a plurality of metallic strands. The electric resistance of each end cap may fall within a range of 0.1 5 Î©. The end caps may be covered at their inner surface with an electrically insulating member which has a tubular protruding portion 22 surrounding a part of the corresponding electrode 16.
