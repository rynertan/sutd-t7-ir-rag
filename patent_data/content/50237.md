## Description
PLATE OF SPECIAL REFRACTING SECTION FOR COVERING A CONCENTRATING SOLAR COLLECTOR, WHICH CAN BE ECONOMICALLY MANUFACTURED FROM GLASS BY CONTINUOUS PROCESS, AS WELL AS SOLARCOLLECTOR PROVIDED WITH SUCH PLATE AND PROCESS FOR OBTAININGTHE LATTER Object of the present invention is to provide a plate or structure made of glass which can be used in an advantageous manner as cover for a solar collector.A further object of the present invention is to provide a type of concentrating solar collector especially favourable for utilization of solar energy.Lastly, a further object of the present invention is to provide a continuous manufacturing process for said glass struc tures, wherein said glass structures can be manufactured at particularly low costs with respect to technologies hitherto employed.Typical example of a structure usable as cover for a solar collector which is very efficient in concentrating solar energy even during the critical hours, is that incorporating a section comprising a central element of flat convex lens type and side. dioptric elements with respect to the lens axis, whose number and dimensions are such as to permit maximum collection of solar energy dlring the day.When the dimensions are suitably calculated, these sections possess considerable concenti iting power.Said refracting sections are generally made of acrylic materials and are very costly owing to the difficulty in manufac turing them with the necessary accuracy. Hence their application is especially confined to the field of microfilm readers, photocopiers, viewers in general, telescopes, high speed photographic systems, laser systems.A large scale application of structures or plates having such a section usable as covers for fixed solar collectors has not proved economically feasible up till now.Object of the present invention is to provide a special section to the structure or plate which, besides finding favourable application as cover for solar collectors, can be manufactured at particularly low costs.Normally, the main reasons for adopting powerfull concentrating solar collectors can on the other hand be summed up as follows 1 the temperature of the heat transfer fluid is higher than that obtainable with a normal solar panel 2 the heat dispersion area with respect to the collecting area is reduced, with consequent improvement of thermal performance 33 owing to the reduction of the transistory elements, the rapidity with which the oper ing conditions are reached is increased because the thermal mass is normally very much less than that occurring with flat solar panels.Limitations in generalized application of said concentrating systems can be ascribed to the following disadvantages 1 high manufacturing costs of the concentrating elements 2 sun tracking or follower systems must be used 3 reliability of the flexible tubing conveying the heat transport fluid must guaranteed 4 the good optical properties must be maintained over long periods of time, by limiting deterioration due to ambient effects dusts, scratches, etc. . This can necessitate spe cial attention. during the design stage.Object of the present invention is precisely that of providing a concentrating solar collector in which the aforesaid disadvantages are considerably reduced.There is then the problem of finding an economic process for producing such plates or structures.Processes and equipment for continuous glass strip manufacture are certainly already known. Also known are processes and equipment especially suitable for continuous manufacture of glass plate which can be impressed on one or both surfaces with designs and or embossing of various types, commercially known as figured glass .More especially it is known how the layer of molten glass, on leaving the furnace, is conveyed along a pouring channel to the rolls of a rolling mill.These rolls bear the negative designs which are then stamped on one or both surfaces of t.le glass plate still in the molten state.After stamping the designs, tne glass plate is then submitted to the subsequent annealing, cooling and cutting phases.However, up till now it has not been possible, this being one of the objects of the present invention, to continuously produce by means of a known process refracting glass sections which can be used to advantage in concentrating solar collec tors.In order to utilize the process employed in the manufacture of figured glass, one of the two rolls in the rolling mill through which the molten glass layer passes must, in fact, be shaped so as to stamp the refracting section design on one of the two surfaces of said layer.The main difficulties from the manufacturing point of view in obtaining such a section with the figured glass process, which have hitherto prevented its application, are as follows forming of excessively deep furrows between the dioptric elements quite close together or even adjacent without impairing the feasibility of the actual section reproduction of dioptric elements of higher power which, owing to their limited width, give rise to a profile being quite jagged in the outer parts of the lens maximum permissible lens w dth 600 mm.Hybrid combinations of dioptric elements were then resorted to, which, by providing the required width, would exhibit satisfactory concentrating properties and acceptable behaviour towards the apparent rotation of the sun.Hence the following different combinations were taken into consideration 1 sections consisting of more than one flat convex lenses in the central part, which are further and symmetrically provided with dioptric elements in such a number as to take into account the limitation in width 2 structures consisting of just one central element located between the dioptric elements with concentrating power inverse of their order.Lastly the Applicant has devised a solution to solve the many complex difficulties in manufacture, which is simple enough but at the same time revolutionary, that of using a lens with two major axes as plate section. Several esperiments have been carried out, and after a careful evaluation of the results, it was found that it was possible to obtain a plate or structure able to satisfy the aforementioned requirements, by placing side by side two identical flatconvex lenses of already known type with side elements, each lens having a width of about 300 mm. In this way, a flat lens is obtained having as stated previously two distinct major axes hence this lens can also be defined as a biaxial lens.This structure possesses cons derable advantages with respect to conventional type structures, the most important being 1 the consequent reduction in height of the dioptric elements which permits, for the first time, manufacture of the plate, in glass, using the already known process for figured glass production 2 the particular optical behaviour of the plate, as it is based on a biaxial lens which permits its adaption to a type of solar collector featuring considerably reduced surfaces of the absorber.The preferred geometry of the biaxial lens consists of two twin lenses coupled together, with overall width of 622 mm, and with two major axes spaces at a distance of 311 mm.The above geometry is illustrated in fig. 1 of the accompanying drawings given as an exemplification of the principles of the invention without limitation while fig. 2 illustrates a monaxial lens of already known type.As can be seen in the drawing, the common thickness ei of the dioptric elements is preferably o 7 mm, while their minimum width is 14 mm.Furthermore, thickness e of the substrate common to the dioptric elements is preferably equal rv4 mm.In order to reveal the behaviour. of the lens as illustrated in the fixed position, and more especially to evaluate its concentrating capability, calculations were made on the basis of a practical situation.Hence the section was oriented in the East West direction with the inlet plane of the rays lying normal to the sun s rays at 12 hour.The latitude chosen was 420 North and the hourly path of the sun on the 22nd of June was taken into consideration.A section, having for the sake of example, the following dimensions e 7 mm e 4 mm L 600 mm was found to have a concentration ratio equal to about 1.6.Therefore the optical behaviour of the section with biaxial lens in fig. 1 is such as tz favour its use as cover plate for flat solar collectors. Of course, the biaxial lens could be used for different zones of latitude by suitably varying the dimensions of the section. Various experiments were conducted in order to identify where, amongst the various planes parallel to the lens plane, there was less dispersion of the sun s rays in direction y of a clockwise arc ranging from 8 to 16.Examination of the results showed that the plane with least dispersion for the biaxial lens was that lying at a distance d 250 mm.The travel of the concentrated sun s rays along the abscissa y totalled a length of 195 mm.As the overall width of the half biaxial lens is equal to 311 mm, a concentration ratio along the y axis is obtained for each lens section which is C 1.6Bearing in mind that the lenses are kept in a fixed position and that the calculation was made in practical terms, the concentration ratios are more than satisfactory.The use of glass sections thus means considerably advantages are to be gained in the solar collector field. They can be easily deduced from fig. 3 which gives the shape of the surface of the absorber whereupon the above described lens can act as a cover. Said figure gives the image on plane yz that the sun successively assumes from 8 to 12 hours on the plane of minimum dispersion lying at a distance d 250 from the lens plane, the images for the afternoon hours are obtained by symmetry with respect to the y axis . When a concentrating solar collector uses the biaxial lens in accordance with the invention, it possesses the following advantages 1 reduced dimensions of the absorber surface in fact it is merely necessary to limit development of the collecting surface to that effectively struck by the luminous energy during the movement of the sun, with the solar image on the preselected plane really affecting a surface of almost trapezoidal shape if an absorber with such geometry is used, the concentration ratio along direction y would also be varied to C 1.98 2 easy insulation of the absorber with consequent improvement of thermal performance of the solar collector 3 an appreciable higher temperature of the fluid cir culating in the solar collector can be obtained 4 optimum thermal performance can be achieved without use of sun followers which would cause users the normal periodic maintenance problems 5 the good optical properties of the systems can be maintained for long periods of time by limiting deterioration due to ambient effects dusts, scratches, etc. .
