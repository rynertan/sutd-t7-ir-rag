## Abstract
A distance relay, for indicating single phase to ground faults on a polyphase electric power transmission system, having means 17,18,19 defining a first guard zone quadrila teral characteristic 21,23,25,27 in respect of each phase of the system and means 17,18,19,43,45,47 defining a second main quadrilateral characteristic 23,25,27,49 in respect of each phase of the system, and a logic circuit arrangement 31 to 41 whereby the relay indicates the presence of a fault on a single phase to ground within the reach of the main characteristic relating to the relevant phase only if the corresponding guard zone characteristic, and no other, indicatesd a fault. The slope of the reactance line 21 of each guard zone characteristic is arranged to change its slope under two phase to earth fault conditions by a lesser amount than the reactance line 49 of the coresponding main characteristic. By this means false operation of the relay due to changes in slope of the reactance lines of the characteris tics under two phase to ground fault conditions in avoided.
