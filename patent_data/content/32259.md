# An arrangement for the oriented feeding out of caps.

## Abstract
An arrangement for the oriented feeding out of caps provided with pull zones usually comprises a disc 7 which can rotate at high speed, onto the plane working surface of which the caps are dropped. By the rotation of the disc the caps are moved to the periphery of the disc where they are made to slide along a stationary wall 3 . Through the movement over the disc and the contact with the wall the caps are oriented, and correctly oriented caps are removed subsequently by means of guide plates via an opening in the wall, to be conveyed further to a capping machine. The col lection of the caps by means of the guide plates and the feeding out through the limiting opening in the wall, how ever, sometimes causes deformations which prevent the feeding out. The arrangement in accordance with the invention has instead of the wall 3 provided with openings a guide rail in the form of an uninterrupted ring which is arranged at such a distance above the surface of the disc that the cap is allowed partly to slide in under the guide rail. However, the lug on the cap prevents the cap from wholly passing under the guide rail. At a point along the periphery a radially movable feeding out element 8 is provided which engages with the passing caps and withdraws them via the space between the disc and the guide rail, with a short time deformation of the pull lug.
