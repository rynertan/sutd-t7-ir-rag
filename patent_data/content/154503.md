# Digital signal processor.

## Abstract
There is provided with a digital signal processor for performing the signal processes relative to phase or frequency, for example, the demodulating processes of the modulation signals such as the PSK signals. This processor is provided with amplitude to phase converting means 3 which receives two digital input signal series x, y that are inputted to input terminals 1, 2 and that are respectively expressed by a plurality of bits and that have the quadrature phase relation with each other, and which outputs the digital phase information signal 4 corresponding to a combination of the digital values of those two digital signal series x, y , said combination being amplitude information. This processor supplies the phase information signal 4 which is outputted from the amplitude to phase converting means 3 to signal processing means 5 constituted by a digital circuit, thereby digitally processing the phase information signal.
