## Description
The invention relates to a method for the installation of a watertight shield in the soil by digging a channel in the soil by means of a ground mill to be moved into the soil from above, which after making a part of the channel is always displaced forwards over a distance which is equal to its own working length and in which process the channel in the part situated behind the mill is kept filled with a heavy fluid such as bentonite, and in the part of the channel filled with bentonite a film is installed over the entire height of the channel and the said channel is again filled in at a distance from the mill and behind the part filled with bentonite. A method of this type is, for example, known from the French patent 2,038,719. According to the said known method sheets of film from a stock roll of film horizontally disposed above the ground level are pressed downwards to the floor of the channel constructed previously. After construction the shield therefore consists of a number of vertical sheets disposed next to each other. To obtain a seal the sheets overlap each other over a more or less large length. This known method is complicated and has in particular the drawback that the seal is guaranteed to an inadequate extent. This is in particular of importance if ground water has to be separated from heavily contaminated soil. The object of the invention is therefore to provide a method by which a shield of considerable length can be made with no vertical welding seams or a minimum thereof. According to the invention this object is achieved in that the channel is always sealed at the front end, after a part of the channel has been made, by means of a vertical shutter which extends over the entire height of the channel and can be clamped between the side walls of the channel, behind the said mill in the channel a stock roll with film material is positioned in the vertical position, the width of the sheet of film material corresponding to the depth of the channel, at a distance from the said frontmost shutter, but behind the stock roll, one or more further shutters are positioned by means of which film material can be clamped between the shutter or shutters and a side wall of the channel, which distance is so large that the stock roll can unwind a length of film material which is at least equal to the working length of the mill, of which shutters one is withdrawn each time and after the roll has been moved forward is positioned in the channel immediately behind the roll and secured. According to the invention film material is therefore used, the width of which corresponds to the depth of the channel and which is unwound in the direction of advance of the channel construction. As a result of this it is possible to construct an continuous shield, i.e. a shield without welding seams, in lengths of many hundreds if not thousands of metres. In this process it is of considerable importance that the film, of which the shield is made, is held clamped by one or more shutters during the construction process and before the channel is filled in with sand or soil. This guarantees that the shield comes to rest in a taut condition against a side wall of the channel. In this process the frontmost shutter not only ensures that the ground mill situated in front thereof in the direction of cosntruction can work in an area which can be kept free from bentonite, in which connection reference may be made to Dutch patent application .... No. 32,714 filed on the same date, but the unwinding can take place in the space already filled with bentonite with the correct tension and without interference from the operations necessary further upstream, such as the filling of the channel with soil. In this connection according to the invention it is of advantage that in addition to the frontmost or first shutter and the second shutter to be placed upstream thereof, which determines the run in which the film is situated, two further shutters are positioned upstream, concrete being supplied into the space between the second and third shutter and sand and soil being provided in the space between the third and fourth shutter. On withdrawing the fourth shutter it may be beneficial to inject the space made available when this is done with bentonite. With the method according to the invention it is possible to make a virtually continuous shield in the soil in a stepwise process, the run being worked on having small dimensions with respect to the run possible in total. The invention also relates to a device or devices for the application of the method according to the invention. Thus, according to the invention the shutter or shutters may consist of a tube, rectangular in cross section, which is provided at two side walls situated opposite each other with inflatable closed tubes extending over the entire height of the shutter with a flexible wall facing outwards, and the hollow cavity of these tubes can be connected to a source of medium under pressure. A tubular shutter of this type is readily handled by means of a lifting device such as a mobile crane, and after expansion makes contact with the side walls of the channel, unevenness of the side walls being compensated for. Preferably, all the shutters are constructed in the same manner and can therefore also take the place of each other. A further device for the application of the method according to the invention may consist of a displaceable frame provided with a tube suspended or suspendible therein a vertical sense with means for supporting, at the correct point on the base of the tube, the spindle of a roll of film, which tube is open at the top and is provided over the entire length with a passage slit for film material. This frame may be mobile or displaceable, for example, on reinforcing or guide tracks, for example in the form of steel tubes, disposed next to the channel. The tube may form part of the frame or be installed in a manner such that it can be lifted out again, which is of importance particularly at the start and at the end of the operations. The tube serves to accommodate the stock of film material, which stock roll can be lowered into the tube by means of a lifting device and the bottom end of the spindle guided into the bearing intended therefore. The drive, which can engage the spindle at the top end, should have a connection to the said top end of the spindle of a type such that the drive can be moved away, for example swivelled out of the space above the opening of the tube. The film can of course be installed without a drive for the stock roll and in particular as a result of the fact that the foil automatically unwinds when the part already present in the channel is fixed by clamping with a shutter. In view of the fact that in this connection large dimensions are involved and a uniform installation of the film is desired, whereas, on the other hand, tears must be avoided, it is, however, to be preferred that a drive be used with which the spindle of the stock roll can be driven or braked. In order to ensure that the frame is guided in the correct manner with respect to the channel, the frame may be provided with guide elements which can grip the side walls of the channel. The said guide elements may consist of vertical cylinders positioned respectively in front of and behind the tube or tubes, which cylinders are swivellable around a vertical centre line of the most adjacent tube. This swivel movement may, if necessary, be controlled by means of aids such as hydraulic cylinders. This is desirable in order to be able to follow a bent path of a channel. The tube closed at the bottom, in which the stock roll with film material is located, has of course the tendency to float upwards in the bentonite filling of the channel. In order to avoid this the frame may also have a ballast tube parallel to the tube and next to it viewed in the longitudinal direction which also reaches deep down into the channel. By the use of more or less ballast, for example water ballast, in the said tube, the position of the frame can be controlled. Both tubes may be accommodated in a casing which is rectangular in horizontal cross section. The invention will now be explained in more detail by reference to the drawings. Figures 1 and 4 show a soil area 1 in which a watertight shield 2 has to be installed. In the left hand section of Figures 1 and 4 and as shown in Figures 2 and 3, the shield is already present and the channel filled in. The construction of the channel takes place by means of a ground mill 3, which is moved downwards from the top as follows from a comparison of Figures 1 and 4 and in this manner a subsequent channel section 4 is made. In the channel section constructed previously there are situated a number of shutters, each consisting of a rectangular tube with seals as shown in Figure 5. The frontmost shutter 5 serves to seal off the channel section constructed previously. Behind the said shutter 5, from the point of view of the direction of construction, there is a filling which may consist, for example of bentonite, and is indicated by 6. At a distance from the shutter 5 there is a second shutter 7 and at a distance from the latter again a third shutter 8 or 9 respectively. Between the shutters 5 and 7 there is situated the film installation device 10, which is more clearly depicted in Figures 6 to 9 incl. The shutters 7, 8 and 9 seal off successive areas of the channel and hold the film 2 against the side wall of the channel. The film installation device 10 is situated in a space filled with bentonite. The space behind the shutter 7 is also filled with bentonite and the space between the shutters 8 and 9 is a space which is again filled, for example with sand. To the left of shutter 9 the shield is ready and the channel is again filled. Between the shutters 7 and 8 a pipe, not shown, reaching to the floor of the channel can supply concrete by means of which a floor sealing 11 is obtained in which the bottom edge of the film is anchored. From Figure 4 it is evident that while the ground mill 3 moves downwards, the film installation device 10 is shifted forwards, a length of foil thus being unwound. Figure 4 also shows that the rearmost shutter 9 can be withdrawn after completion of the sand filling. Bentonite is preferably injected into the space made available. When the ground mill has made a new channel section and the latter has been filled with bentonite after or during the withdrawal of the ground mill, then the shutter 9 just removed can be displaced forwards and clamped in the channel immediately in front of the front wall of the channel. The shutter shown in Figure 5 consists of a rectangular tube 12 with tubular ribs 13. At a position of the two narrow side walls situated opposite each other seals or tubes 14 and 15 consisting, for example, of rubber are provided which are clamped to the front or rear wall of the tube as shown, for example at 16, and which can be inflated with a fluid and or gaseous medium under pressure and then make contact with the side wall 17 or 18 of the channel. In the upper section Figure 5 shows a contact of this type, while in the lower section seal 15 is shown in the retracted position. The device for the installation of the film may consist of a frame 20 in which a tube 21 is suspended with an enlarged top opening 22, in which tube a roll with film material 23 may be placed, which material is wrapped around a spindle 24 which is supported at the bottom in the tube 21 in a bearing 25 and has lifting eyelets 26 for the installation or removal. The tube has a removal slit 26 through which the film material can pass already unwound. The spindle 24 is preferably driven or braked by means of a drive device 27 with clutch 28 which is attached to a frame 29 which is mounted in a swivellable manner around a second tube 30 and as a result of this can be swung away from its position above the tube 21 to a position which is adjacent so that a film supply roll can be replaced. The second tube 30 also extends to near the floor of the channel. This tube serves to install ballast therein in order to float upwards in the bentonite filling. The device is preferably provided with guide cylinders 31 and 32 which are attached with construction parts 33 and 34 in a manner such that they are each swivellable around the centre line of the adjacent tube 21 or 30 respectively. The two tubes 21 and 30 can be coupled to each other by means of a rectangular housing 35, as a result of which an additional guidance is obtained inside the channel. Figure 10 shows how the guides function on passing along a track deviating at an angle. The frame 20 may be provided with wheels 36, by means of which the frame can be displaced along steel tubular bars 37 on either side of the channel. Other means of displacement are of course also conceivable.
