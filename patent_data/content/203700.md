# LOGIC LEVEL TRANSLATORS

## Abstract
A logic level translator having high switching speeds for converting ECL logic levels into TTL logic levels includes a pair of input transistors for receiving ECL input logic level signals and an output transistor for generating TTL output logic level signals. Current mirror transistors are interconnected between the input transistors and the output transistor for turning on and off the output transistor. High pass networks are coupled to the current mirror transistors for increasing its transient response so as to facilitate turning on and off quickly the output transistor. The TTL output logic levels have a relatively small propagation delay responsive to transitions of the ECL input logic level signals.
