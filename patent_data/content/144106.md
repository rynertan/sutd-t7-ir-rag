# Improved process for the production of polyphenyleneoxide.

## Abstract
Process for the production of polyphenylenexoxide, in which oxygen, or a gas containing molecular oxygen is fed into a liquid reaction medium, solvent of the 2,6 xylenol and of the catalyst cupric salt complexed with an organic base, but nor solvent or substantially not solvent of the polypheny leneoxide from time to time samples are collected of the reaction mixture, said samples are treated with a liquid solvent, capable of dissolving polyphenyleneoxide and of stopping the growth of the macromolecules, until a clear and homogeneous solution is obtained the through time of the so obtained solution is measured in a capillary tube viscometer and the value is determined of the viscosity and of the molecular weight of polyphenyleneoxide by the comparison with standard values and on the basis of the so determined value of the viscosity and or of the polyphenyleneoxide molecular weight inter ventions are effected on the oxidative polymerizing reaction of 2,6 xylenol.
