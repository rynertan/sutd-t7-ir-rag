# AUTOMATIC TOUCH SCREEN CALIBRATION METHOD

## Abstract
A method for automatically calibrating a touch screen used in conjunction with a graphic display is executed prior to every interactive session. Three points, defining perpen dicular axes, are displayed and an operator is instructed to touch the touch screen at each of the points in succession. Coordinates for the three points output by the touch screen are checked for reasonableness and perpendicularity. If these checks are passed, a coordinate translation matrix is generated for converting touch screen coordinates into display coordinates.
