## Description
BUILDING OR CONSTRUCTION TOY The present invention concerns a building or construction toy in which blocks or other parts may be releasably but firmly interconnected by interengaging male and female connecting means. Toy sets of this type are known, which are made of unitary material, mostly plastics materials, the male and corresponding female connecting means being integral with the body of the blocks or other parts and as the material is, in most cases expensive, the blocks must, be necessity, be of a hollow form and also of relatively thin cross section so that the cost should not become excessive.This renders the blocks or other parts somewhat flimsy and may also cause early breakage if the blocks are roughly handled as may happen with children for whom the blocks are usually intended. There are also known toy sets of the said kind, also of unitary material, mostly wood, where blocks and other partsareXinter connected by pegs of the same material inserted into holes in the blocks. Constructions made from such sets tend to be unstable and sometimes somewhat clumsy. The present invention provides an improved construc tion building toy set made of two different materials wherein the blocks and other parts which make up the bulk of the set may be of an inexpensive material such as wood, in which case also waste material of other wood working processes may be utilised, and connecting means are provided made from a second material having suitable characteristics, in the main some elasticity and ease of providing a suitable form, preferably plastics materials. Thus, the invention provides a building or construction toy comprising a plurality of construction modules made from a first material which provides stiff ness and interchangeable male and female module connecting means made from a second material which is resiliently deformable to permit releasable but firm interengagement between the male and female connecting means. The main advantages to be gained bv the present invention are saving in costs, as the bulk of the materials used are inexpensive and the more expensive plastics comprise only a small fraction. A second advantage is that constructions made from the claimed set are firm as the first material provides stiffness and the elasticity of the plastics material provides for firm interconnections. Therefore, houses constructed from the present toy hold firmly and other constructions such as cars or see saws may be put to a measure of active use by children. The basic elements or building modules of the building or construction toy of the present invention may be elongated or cubic blocks having through holes and or closed end recesses therein. Male and female connecting means are provided, made from an appropriate material which may preferably be a plastics material, the female connecting means may be fixedly held inside the holes or recesses in said blocks and the male connecting means which protrude from said blocks may be integral with the female means or separate, in which latter case they are also fixedly held in said holes or recesses. The protruding length of the male connecting means may be so dimensioned that when they fully interchange with the corresponding female means, the adjacent blocks thus connected should lie in close contact as when building a wall.In other words, the length of the protruding part of the male means should be equal to the depth of the corresponding female means. End blocks may also be provided, having only female means held in closed end recesses therein. Appropriate corner elements may also be provided, these may be either blocks having appropriate male or female means or adjacent faces or formed angle pieces with appropriate male or female means therein, in appropriate faces preferably they are female means interengaging with male means on corresponding blocks. or other parts and additional elements such as hinged windows or doors, wheels, wheel hubs and the like may be provided in addition which may also comprise the characteristic features of the invention . The end blocks and possibly also intermediate blocks may assume the form of arches, spires, gable roofs and other like pieces may also be provided. The most characteristic components of the claimed toy are the connecting means. These may be male and female but may also preferably be integral male female parts.These may be inserted in through holes in blocks or the like intended to build main walls or the like. The connecting means may assume different forms, they may be simply cylindrical, the male means fitting into the female ones, they may be slightly conical facilitating interfitting, the male means may be plain, solid or hollow, or they may be of any other suitable form. In the most preferred embodiment, the male means are hollow, cylindrical and have serrated ends in order to confer more elasticity thereto, their diameter is preferably slightly less than the diameter of the main lumen of the female means The corresponding female means have a cylindrical lumen and there is a constriction or projections near the inside end thereof, e.g. an annular ring, the ends of the male means engaging only this constriction. Another conceivable embodiment, less preferred, may consist of male means having serrated ends with appropriate protrusions thereon, said protrusions inter fitting with corresponding recesses in the walls of the female means.In the case of integral male female means, the inner end of the female part may be formed only by an appropriate shoulder, there is no need for an integral dividing wall.When the male and female means are separate and the male means is hollow, the non interengaging ends thereof may be open or closed this may be dictated by the convenience of methods of fabrication. For the sake of brevity, only the most preferred embodiment of an integral male female connecting means will be described in more detail and illustrated in the accompanying drawing. There is no necessity for illustrating the blocks or other like parts, these being conventional except for the holes or recesses, which holes or recesses by necessity correspond to the connecting means described in more detail hereinafter. The drawing illustrates an integral male female connecting means in longitudinal section. It is self explanatory. In the case of male and female parts which are separate, the dividing line therebetween. would be the line A A in the drawing. In the drawing, which illustrates an integral malefemale connecting means, the male part is designated in general by the numeral 1 and female part by the numeral 2.The line dividing between the two parts is indicated byA A, the part of the integrated connector below the line indicated by B B being embedded in a through hole in a corresponding block, the part above this line protruding and the lower end of the connector preferably flush with a face of the block or slightly recessed therein. It is self evident that when the protruding male part is inserted into the female part of the connector in an adjacent block, the appropriate faces of the two blocks will be in close contact and a clean finished wall will be formed by a series of thus connected blocks. The same applies in relation to other components such as e.g. arches, spires or columns, if appropriate. The serrated end of the male part is designated in general by 3, it comprises prongs 4, there preferably being three such prongs and correspondingly cut out slits 5, the number of slits being equal to the number of prongs. The numeral 6 designates a constriction in the form of an annular ring in the lumen of the female part elastically interengageable with prongs 4 of an adjacent connector. The end of the female part is formed by a shoulder 8. In order to hold the connector more firmly in the block, a number of ridges, preferably three designated by numeral 7 may optionally be provided. As already stated hereinbefore, separate male or female connecting means are not illustrated by separate figures they can easily be envisaged by separating the appended drawing along dividing line A A. The wooden and plastics parts of the claimed building or construction toy may be produced by methods accepted in the woodworking and in the plastics materials industries. The preceding general and detailed description discloses only non limiting general and specific embodiments of the invention and the scope of the invention is not limited thereby.
