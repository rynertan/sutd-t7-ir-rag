# Triaxially braided fabric prosthesis.

## Abstract
A novel prosthesis 1 for use in repairing or replacing soft tissue is disclosed, which comprises a triaxially braided fabric element 3 having interwoven first, second and third sets of fibres 9, 11, 13 , with the fibers of the second and third sets 11, 13 being oriented at substantially the same acute braid ing angle A with respect to the fibers of the first set 9 . An elongated ligament prosthesis exhibiting the desired proper ties of high strength and high elasticity may be prepared by selecting high elasticity fibers for the first set 9 , orienting said first set of fibers 9 in the longitudinal direction of the prosthesis and selecting fibers having high yield strength and high Young s modulus for the second and third sets 11, 13 . A tubular prosthesis in which high elasticity fibres are oriented in the longitudinal direction is highly suitable for use as a vascular prosthesis. A prosthesis of the invention may also be manufactured in the form of a prosthetic heart valve leaflet.
