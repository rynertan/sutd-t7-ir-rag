# Improved drip chamber.

## Abstract
An improved conduit 50 communicating between a pressurized source 10 of solution and a partially filled reservoir 34 associated with a drip chamber 24 in a continuous flush system. The conduit comprises a tube 54,56 that is bent at approximately a 45 degree angle so that solution discharging from the conduit 50 is diverted to impinge against the interior wall 58 of the reservoir 34 before interfacing with the solution 62 accumulated therein. The arrangement reduces bubble formation normally associ ated with turbulent discharge flow during filling and flushing of the system.
