The above compounds have been listed only for the purpose of illustration of the possible compounds having general formula I and all possessing an anti oxidizing action. The compounds of general formula I can be synthesized accordina to any conventional method known in the literature. Thus, for instance, the compounds having general formula I in which X is CH2 , can be synthesized by reacting 4 amino piperidine with the ester of an unsaturated acid, according to the reaction sçtema EMI6.1 in which R8 is an alkyl radical having 1 to 4 carbon atoms.The obtained ester is subjected to basic hydrolysis and acidi fication with a mineral acid, and the acid thus obtained or an alkaline salts thereof is reacted with a reactive metal salt, such as for instance Nick2. Compounds having general formula I in which X is CO , can be easily synthesized according to the reaction schema EMI6.2 Such synthetic polymers can be used in the form of powder, granules, or shaped articles such as, for example, fibres, films, sheets, etc., and other shaped articles or latexes or foams. Among the above synthetic polymers, the most suitable one for being used according to this invention, are the polyolefins deriving from monomers having general formula R CH CH2, wherein R is an alkyl or aryl group, or hydrogen. The present preferred polyolefin is polypropylene consist ing prevailingly of isotactic macromolecules and obtained by polymerization of propylene, in the presence of stereospecifi catalyst. The amount of compound, having general formula I , to be added to the substance to be stabilized, according to this invention, is not critical and may vary in a. wide range as function of the type, properties and particular uses of the substance. Generally, safd stabilizers can be added in amounts ranging from 0.01 to 5.0 by weight in practice, however, the effective amount varies as a function of the type of substance to be stabilized. Thus, for example, in the case of polyolefins, the effective amount can range from 0.01 to 2 by weight in the case of polyvinyl and polyvinylidene chloride, such amount can range from 0.01 to 1 by weight while, in the case of polyurethanes and polyamides, such amount may range from 0.01 to 5 by weight. The stabilizer having general formula I may be employed either alone or in admixture with other known additive such as anti oxidizers, ultraviolet ray absorbers, pigments, fillers, basic nitrogen containing polycondensates, other stabi and successive treatment of the acid or an alkaline salt thereof with a reactive metal salt, such as for instance Nick2. The compounds of general formula I may be used as stabilizers of organic materials usually subject to degradation due to the action of heat, oxygen and attinic light. The materials which can be stabilized with the above reported compounds, are mainly synthetic organic polymeric substances which include, for instance polyolefins, such as olefin homopolymers, among which high and low density polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polybutadiene, polyisoprene, and the likes and copolymers of the olefins with other ethylenically unsaturated mono mers, such as ethylene propylene copolymers, styrene butene copolymers, styrene butadiene copolymers, styrene acryloni trile copolymers and acrylonitrile styrene butadiene copo lyme rs polyvinyl chloride and polyvinylidene chloride, including both the homopolymers and copolymers of vinyl chloride and of vinylidene chloride with each other or each of them with vinyl acetate or with other ethylenically unsaturated mono mers polyacetals, such as polyoxymethylene and polyoxyethylene polyesters, such as polyethylene terephtalates polyamides, such as Nylon 6, Nylon 6 6 and Nylon 6 10 polyurethanes polyearbonates butadiene styrene copolymers natural and synthetic rubbers, etc. lizers, etc. Some examples of such additives are oxi benzo triazoles, oxi benzo phenones, Ni stabilizers, metal soaps, phenolic antioxidants, phosphites, thioesters, hydroquinone derivatives, triazine compounds, acyl amino phenols, benzyl phosphonates, etc. Such additives may be used along with the compounds having general formula I , according to the present invention, in a ratio by weight ranging from 0.5 1 to 3 1. The compounds having general formula I or the mixture containing said compounds can be incorporated into the synthe tic polymer or the substance to be stabilized according to any known procedure and at any stage either before or after polymerization or during the manufacture of the shaped article from the polymer. Thus, for example, it is possible to effect a simple admixing of the additives in powder form, under stirring to the polymer or the polymer can be mixed together with a solution of the stabilizers in a suitable solvent, which will successively be evaporated or the stabilizers can be added to the polymer at the end of the polymerization process. Furthermore, it is possible to get the stabilizing action by applying the stabilizer on the manufactured article, for example, by dipping it into a solution or dispersion of the stabilizer, and then by evaporating the solvent or the dispersant, or by dissolving the stabilizer in a suitable solvent and then by spraying the solution on the surface of the manufactured article.
