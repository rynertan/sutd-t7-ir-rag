# Method and apparatus for producing flakes from molten material.

## Abstract
Method and apparatus for producing metal flake of small length to width ratio or small length to thickness ratio directly from a pool or like source of molten metal or molten inorganic compound, or from an unconfined drop of molten metal or an unconfined drop of molten inorganic compound having a surface tension and viscosity similar to that of molten metal, consisting of forming such products by the application of a rotating heat extracting disk like member 20 having a generally circular serrated edge to the surface of the pool of molten material 21 so as to form the material into discrete flake particles by extracting the flake particles from the supply of molten material and controlling the final shape of the product by the physical shape of the member, the temperature and material composition of the melt, as well as the velocity of the member in contact with the melt.
