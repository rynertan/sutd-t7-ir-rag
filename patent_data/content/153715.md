## Abstract
A double extruder for the production of a two layer tubular extruded product, which extruder comprises a treating screw 8 rotatably mounted in a housing provided in a frame 2 and forming a ring shaped treating space 21 between the frame and the screw, and inlet and outlet channels 13, 22, 23 extending to the periphery of the treating screw for supplying materials to be extruded into the treating space and for discharging the materials therefrom and extrusion means 14 mounted in the frame and communicating with the outlet channel. The treating screw is tubular and forms two separate treating spaces together with the frame, each space extending from the outer periphery of the treating screw around the end edge to the inner periphery of the screw. The outlet channel is ring shaped and joins radially the inner periphery of the tubular treating screw.
