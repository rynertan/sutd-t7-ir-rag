# Transducer coupling apparatus and inhomogeneity detector.

## Abstract
A transducer coupling member 10, 50 for use with systems for detecting inhomogeneities in fluids flowing in a conduit 16, 63 . A first portion 18, 52 of the member is acoustically coupled to the conduit wall. An electromechan ical transducer 22, 56 is mounted upon another portion 25, 54 . These two portions are partially acoustically cou pled. The composite system forms a bandpass filter which eleminates frequencies and modes of oscillation which travel largely in the conduit 16, 63 , thus preventing the system form being rendered insensitive to inhomogeneities. The bandpass automatically adjusts to accommodate a vari ety of conduits.
