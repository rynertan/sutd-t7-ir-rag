# Bioactant translocation agent.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to novel agents for increas ing the basipetal translocation of agricultural chemicals such as plant growth promoters, inhibitors, fungicides, insectici des or herbicides hereinafter referred to as bioactants , The present agent comprises a mixture of N heterocyclic amide and a haloethyl phosphonic acid in a mole ratio of between about 5 1 and about 1 10, employed in an inert carrier at a con centration between about 25ppm to about 10,000 ppm which mixture can be applied to a plant prior to, or simultaneously with, the bioactant. The translocating agent may be a mixture of the N hetero cyclic amide, e.g. N methyl 2 pyrrolidone, and the haloethyl phosphonic acid, e.g. 2 chloroethylphosphonic acid, it may comprise a mixture of said components with the complexed compound derived from the addition of said components or it may be the complexed compound per se.
