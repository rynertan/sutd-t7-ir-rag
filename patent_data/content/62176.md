# Electrophotographic copier with reciprocating original document carriage.

## Abstract
The reciprocating document carriage of a copier is driven either by a rack and pinion system as shown, or a cable and pulley system. The pinion 105 is driven by a motor 110 which also drives other components of the copier. To prevent shocks to the drive train when the carriage changes direction, the pinion is driven forward rigidly and backward resiliently. This is achieved by mounting an outer part of the pinion coaxially on an inner part which includes a pawl extending into an aperture in the outer part. During forward drive the pawl engages an end surface of the aperture, during reverse drive the pawl engages the outer part through a spring mounted in the aperture.
