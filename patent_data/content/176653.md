# Polyphenylene ether compositions having improved processability.

## Abstract
Compositions comprising polyphenylene ether resins and high impact polystyrene resins exhibit improved proces sability and reduced adhesion to heated metal surfaces when a minor but effective amount of an ethylene oxide propylene oxide copolymer is included therein.
