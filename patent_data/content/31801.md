The reaction mixture is treated in a common way to give the crystalline end product.The invention also relates to any embodiment of the process of which one starts from any compound obtained as an intermediate in any process step and one carries out the lacking process step, or one breaks off the process at any step, or at which one forms a starting material under the reaction conditions, or at which a reaction component possibly in the form of its salt is present. The new compounds may, depending on the choice of starting materials and process, be present as optical antipodes or racemate, or, if they contain. at least two asymmetric carbon atoms, be present as an isomer mixture racemate mixture .The isomer mixtures racemate mixtures obtained may, depending on physical chemical differences of the components, be separated into the two stereoisomeric diastereomeric pure racemates e.g. by means of chromatography and or fractional crystallization. The racemates obtained can be separated according to known methods, e.g., by means of recrystallization from an optically active solvent, by means of microorganisms, or by a reaction with optically active acids forming salts of the compound, and separating the salts thus obtained, e.g.by means of the different solubility of the diastereomeric salts, from which the antipodes may be set free by the action of a suitable agent. Suitably useable optically active acids are e.g. the L and 0form of tartaric acid, bi o tolyltartaric acid, malic acid, mandelic acid, camphorsulfonic acid or quinic acid. Preferably the more active part of the two antipodes is isolated.Suitably such starting materials are used for carrying out the reactions of the invention, which material leads to groups of end products preferably desired and particularly to the specifically described and preferred end products,The starting materials are known or may, if they are novel, be obtained according to processes known per se.In clinical use the compounds of the invention are usually administered orally, or rectally in the form of a pharmaceutical preparation, which contains the active component as free base in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.Thus the mentioning of the new compounds of the invention is here related to the free amine base even if the compounds are generally or specifically described, provided that the context in which such expressions are used, e.g., in the examples, with this broad meaning should not correspond. The carrier may be a solid, semisolid or liquid diluent or a capsule. These pharmaceutical preparations are a further object of the invention. Usually the amount of active compound is between 0.1 and 99 by weight of the preparation, suitably between 0.5 and 20 by weigh in preparations for injection and between 2 and 50 by weight in preparations for oral administration.In the preparation of pharmaceutical preparations containing a compound of the present invention in the form of dosage units for oral administration the compound elected may be mixed with a solid1 pulverulent carrier, as e.g., with lactose, saccharose. sorbitol, mannitol, starch, such as potatoe starch, corn starch, amylopectin,cellulose derivatives or gelatine, as well as with an antifriction agent such as magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, polyethyleneglycol waxes or the like, and be pressed into tablets. If coated tablets are wanted, the above prepared core may be coated with concentrated solu tion of sugar1 which solution may contain, e.g., gum arabicum, gelatine, talc, titandioxide or the like.Furthermore, the tablets may be coated with a laquer d issolved in an easily volatile organic solvent or mixture of solvents. To this coating a dye may be added in order to easily distinguish between tablets with different active compounds or with different amounts of the active compound present.In the preparation of soft gelatine capsules pearl shaped, closed capsules , which consist of gelatine and, e.g., glycerine, or in the preparation of similar closed capsules, the active compound is mixed with a vegetable oil. Hard gelatine capsules may contain granules of the active compound in combination with a solid, pulverulent carrier as lactose, saccharose, sorbitol, mannitol, starch as, e.g., potatoe starch, corn starch or amylopectin , cellulose derivatives or gelatine. Dosage units for rectal administration may be prepared in the form of suppositories, which contain the active substance in a mixture with a neutral fat base, or they may be prepared in the form of gelatine rectal capsules which contain the active substance in a mixture with a vegetable oil or paraffin oil.Liquid preparations for oral administration may be present in the form of sirups or suspensions, e.g.solutions containing from about 0.2 by weight to about 20 by weight of the active substance described, glycerol and propylene glycol. If desired, such liquid preparations may contain colouring agents, flavouring agents, saccharine and carboxymethylcellulose as a thickening agent.The preparation of pharmaceutical tablets for peroral use is carried out in accordance with the following method The solid substances included are ground or sieved to a certain particle size. The binding agent is homogenized and suspended in a certain amount of solvent.The therapeutic compound and necessary auxiliary agents are mixed with continuous and constant mixing with the binding agent solution and are moistened so that the solution is uniformly divided in the mass without overmoistening any parts. The amount of solvent is usually so adapted that the mass obtains a consistency reminding of wet snow. The moistening of the pulverulent mixture with the binding agent solution causes the particles to gather together slightly to aggregates and the real granulating process is carried out in such a way that the mass is pressed through a sieve in the form of a net of stainless steel having a mesh size of about mm. The mass is then placed in thin layers on a tray to be dried in a drying cabinet.This drying takes place during 10 hours and has to be standardized carefully as the damp degree of the granulate is of outmost importance for the following process and for the feature of the tablets.Drying in a fluid bed may possibly be used. In this case the mass is not put on a tray but is poured into a container having a net bottom.After the drying step the granules are sieved so that the particle size wanted is obtained . Under certain circumstances powder has to be removed.To the so called final mixture, disintegrating, antifriction agents and antiadhesive agents are added. After this mixture the mass shall have its right composition for the tabletting step.The cleaned tablet punching machine is provided with a certain set of punches and dies, whereupon the suitable adjustment for the weight of the tablets and the degree of compression is tested out. The weight of the tablet is decisive for the size of the dose in each tablet and is calculated starting from the amount of therapeutic agent in the granules. The degree of compression affects the size of the tablet, its strength and its ability of disintegrate in water. Especially with regard to the two later properties the choice of compression pressure 0.5 to 5 ton means something of a compromise. When the right adjustment is set, the preparation of tablets is started and is carried out with a rate of 20.000 to 200.000 tablets per hour. The pressing of the tablets requires different times and depends on the size of the batch. The tablets are freed from adhering pulver in a specific apparatus and are then stored in closed packages until they are delivered.Many tablets, especially those which are rough or bitter, are coated with a coatings This means that they are coated with a layer of sugar or some other suitable coating. The tablets are usually packed by machines having an electronic counting device. The different types of packages consist of glass or plastic gallipots but also boxes, tubes and specific dosage adapted packages.The daily dose of the active substance varies and is dependent on the type of administration, but as a general rule it is 100 to 1000 mg day of active substance at peroral administration.
