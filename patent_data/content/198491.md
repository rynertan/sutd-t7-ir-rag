# A method for the preparation of an anisotropic sintered permanent magnet.

## Abstract
In place of the static magnetic field used in the conven tional powder metallurgical process in the step of the orien tation of anisotropically magnetic particles during shaping by compression to give a green body prior to sintering, the magnetic field applied to the mass of magnetic particles is given pulse wise and an impacting compressive force is ap plied to the thus oriented particles in the direction parallel to the magnetic field during the period in which a pulse of the pulse wise magnetic field is sustained. This method en sures to obtain a much higher degree of particle orientation than in the conventional static field method by virtue of the possibility of obtaining a much stronger magnetic field with out problems otherwise unavoidable. The principle of the method is applicable also to the preparation of a cylindrical or annular permanent magnet magnetizable in a plurality of radial directions.
