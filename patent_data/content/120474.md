# DC voltage control circuits.

## Abstract
A DC voltage control circuit comprising DC superposing means for superposing a control signal an input signal dis criminating means for discriminating an output of the super posing means with a plurality of discriminating levels includ ing a center level and for providing a regenerated output digital signal and an error digital signal control signal generating means for providing control signal in response to the error digital signal and limiter means for limiting the output of said discriminating means to be within a predeter mined range which is less than a spacing between said dis criminating level and the center level.
