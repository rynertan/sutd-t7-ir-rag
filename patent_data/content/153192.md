# Corrosion inhibitor for heavy brines.

## Abstract
The corrosive effects of a heavy brine upon a ferrous metal are reduced by mixing a corrosion inhibitor with the brine, the inhibitor comprising at least one of monovalent and divalent salts of erythorbic acid, ferrous gluconate and sodium gluconate. A molybdate may be included. The brine solution can contain potassium, sodium, calcium or zinc halide salts. The corrosion inhibitor can be used in drilling, completion, packer and workover fluids.
