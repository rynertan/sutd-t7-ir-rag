# Parallel queueing method.

## Abstract
This queue management method enables a single chained queue 10 to have parallel operations by plural element insertion routines and one deletion routine which may be simultaneously executing asynchronously on plural processors for deleting an element, while inserting one or more anchor pointed elements. This is done by providing a dequeueing lock 11 which is only examined by a program routine 50 which is to delete an element, but is not examined by any program routine which is to make an insertion of an anchor pointed element into the queue using a System 370 compare and swap instruction, The embodi ments provide efficient processing in a non pure LIFO queue. which is non pure because the queue can, at the user s option, be used for either LIFO or non LIFO dequeueing . No lock is used on the queue when inserting anchor pointed elements. A special case of non LIFO processing is FIFO first in first out processing, which finds the last element in the queue 10 as the required element.
