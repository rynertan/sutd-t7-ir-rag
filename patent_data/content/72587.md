# Magnetic tape cassette apparatus.

## Abstract
In a magnetic tape cassette apparatus there is provided a head support 8 carrying a pressure roller 7 and a magnetic head 6 , which support is movable relative to a cassette compartment for receiving a magnetic tape cassette 4 . An ejection lever 52 is pivotably mounted in the compartment, which lever, at least during insertion of the cassette, is coupled to an ejection member 57 which is connected to an ejection spring 69 in such a way that, as a result of the pivotal movement of the ejection lever, the ejection member is moved in a first direction 68 from a rest position to an actuated position and the ejection spring is tensioned. The apparatus comprises latching means for latching the ejection member in the actuated position, in which position the ejection lever is freely pivotable relative to the ejection member, at least over some distance.
