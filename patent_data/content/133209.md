# Trichlorosilane production process and equipment.

## Abstract
A process for producing trichlorosilane and equipment for practicing that process are disclosed. The process is a two stage process which combines the reaction of silicon tetrachloride and hydrogen with silicon and the reaction of hydrogen chloride with silicon. In one embodiment of the invention a two stage reactor 10 is provided with a first stage 12 heated to a temperature of about 500 700 C and a second stage 14 maintained at a temperature of about 300 350 C. Each of the first and second stages of the reactor are charged with silicon particles 47, 51 . A mixture com prising hydrogen and silicon tetrachloride are flowed through the silicon particles in the heated first stage to cause a partial hydrogenation of the silicon tetrachlorid. The effluent from the first stage includes trichlorosilane and unreacted hydrogen and silicon tetrachloride. Hydrogen chloride is added to this effluent and the mixture of gases are passed through the silicon particles in the second stage of the reactor.
