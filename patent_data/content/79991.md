## Description
METHOD FOR MAKIMG THIOBISCARBAMATES This invention relates to the manufacture of thioblscarbamates having the general formula EMI1.1 wherein R1 is methyl, ethyl, n propyl, isopropyl, n butyl or isobutyl or the general formula EMI1.2 wherein R2 is methyl, ethyl, n propyl, isopropyl, n butyl, isobutyl, or CH3S CH3 2C and R3 is H or CH2X where X is SCH3 SCH3 , or SCH3. These biscarbamate compounds O are known to have pesticidal activity. U.S. Patent No. 4004031.discloses a method of making these compounds involving simultaneous reaction of carbamate, base, and sulfur chloride SCl2 or S2CL2 .A disadvantage of this prior art method is its relatively tow yield of products and high production of undesirable biproduces. It is an object of this invention to provide 8 method for making thiobiscarbamate compounds that produces higher yields. It is another object of this invention to provide a method for making thiobiscarbamate compounds that produces less bi product. These. and other objects are attained by the present invention,one aspect of which comprises a method for making a compound of the general formula EMI2.1 wherein R1 is methyl, ethyl, n propyl, isopropyl, n butyl or isobutyl comprising the steps of a in presence of solvent, reacting nitrogencontaining heterocyclie base with a sulfur chloride selected from Sic12 or S2C12, or a mixture thereof to form a base sulfur chloride adduct, and thereafter b in presence of solvent, reacting the adduct with acarbamate of the general formula EMI2.2 wherein R1 is as previously defined. A second aspect of the invention comprises a method for making a compound of the general formulaEMI2.3 wherein R2 is methyl, ethyl, n propyl, isopropyl, n butyl, or CH3S CH3 2C , and R3 is H or CH2X wherein X is SCH3,EMI3.1 tb SEP 0 SEP 0 tb SEP 11 SEP II tb SEP S CH3 SEP or SEP SEP S SEP CH3, SEP comprising SEP the SEP steps SEP of tb SEP I tb SEP a 0in SEP presence SEP of SEP solvent SEP reacting tb a nitrogencontaining heterocyclic base with a sulfur chloride selected from SCl2 or S2C12, or a mixture thereof to formabase sulfur chloride adduct, and b in presence of solvent, reacting the adductwEth a carbamate of the general formula EMI3.2 wherein R2 and R3 are as previously defined. This invention is predicated on the discovery that complexing nitrogen containing heterocyc lic base with sulfur chloride in presence of a solvent to form an adduct and thereafter reacting carbamate with the adduct provides a surprising increase in yield. This change in the order of addition of the reactants over that of the prior art is especially effective if the solvent is xylene, and if the sulfur chloride used is SC12. The first step in making thiobiscarbamate compounds in accordance with the present invention is to reactanitrogencontaining heterocyclic base and a sulfur chloride in the presence of a solvent to form a base sulfur chloride adduct. This .is believed to occur in accordance with the following equation EMI4.1 base sulfor auduct dichloride orEMI4.2 Base sulfur mono adduct chloride Preferably sufficient base is used so that all of the sulfur chloride is reacted. The preferred bases are pyridine and 2 ethyl 5 methyl pyridine. The most preferred solvents are commercial grade xylene and pyridine. However many solvents are acceptable, including but not limited to halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichioromethane, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, tetrachloroethane ethers such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, 1,4 dioxane, diisopropyl ether, diphenyl ether, anisole aromatic solvents such as benzene, toluene, o xylene, m xylene, p xylene, ethylbenzene, mesitylene, t butylbenzene, chlorobenzene, nitrobenzene and other organic solvents such as N,N dimethylacetamide, N,N dimethylformamide, acetonitrile, hexane, cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane. Sulfur chloride is the preferred sulfur chloride.However, this compound decomposes slowly according to the equationEMI4.3 Hence commercial SCl2, which currently is believed to contain roughly 70 to 857. SCl2, is a practical and acceptable sulfur chloride. Sulfur monochloride, S2Cl2, is also acceptable, as are mixtures of SCl2 and S2Cl2 The reaction between the base and the sulfur chloride is preferably carried out for about 0.25 to 1 hour at temperatures between about 10 and 50 C. Nore preferably the reaction temperature is about 10 C to 3000 and the reaction time about 20 min to 60 mien. The second step in the process is to react the adduct withacarbamate in the presence of a solvent.A preferred carbamate is methomyl With pyridine as the base, the reaction between methomyl and basesulfur dichloride adduct is believed to proceedEMI5.1 tb as SEP follows tb SEP C,, SEP II tb ri SEP SEP N num tb SEP tCH3 SEP Na SEP S SEP N tb SEP ci SEP C1 tb SEP Adduct tb SEP methomyl tb SEP I tb SEP CH3 C SEP SEP N O C N SEP SEP S SEP SEP 2 SEP tb SEP Ir SEP I1 SEP h tb SEP a SEP preferred SEP thiobiscarbamate SEP H SEP Cl tb The solvents acceptable for the first step in the process, the adduct forming step, are also acceptable for the second step, the reaction with carbamate. The preferred solvents for the second step are again pyridine and xylene, but other solvents are acceptable.Since the first step yields an adduct solvent mixture., preferably the second step is perfomed by adding carbamate to the adduct solvent mixture resulting from the first step. Of course, the adduct could be separated from the solvent used for the first step and a different solvent used for the second step, but such extra processing is not necessary. The second step is preferably carried out at a temperature of from about 0 C to 45 C, more preferably about 15 C to 320C, and for a reacton time of about 1 hour to 96 hours, more preferably about 1 hour to 20 hours. When pyridine is used as both solvent and base, purification of the product mixture from the second step is preferably effected by washing and or slurrying with water or a C lto C 5 alcohol.

The superiority of the present invention can readily be seen by comparing examples 4, 5 and 6 wherein yields of 76.6, 81.3 and 91.3 were attained, with prior art examples 17, 20 and 22 wherein yields of only 70.7, 60.9 and 56.9 were attained using the same or similar solvent and the same base. Further evidence of the present methods superiority can be ascertained by comparing examples 7 and 8 49.0 and 50.7 yields with prior art example 13 wherein only 37.1 yield was attained using CH2C12 as the solvent, and pyridine as the base in both methods. Example 11 shows that good yields here 74.9 can be attained by the present invention using S2C12.Likewise, example 12 shows that the present invention can achieve a good yield with 2 ethyl 5 methyl pyridine as the base. Example 29 Reaction Using Pyridine as Both Solvent and Base The first step was performed as follows The adduct was formed by adding 23 grams of sulfur dichloride to 90 grams of pyridine dropwise over a period of about 15 minutes at 50C. The adduct precipitated to form an adduct slurry. The second step was performed as follows Into Åa separate reactor was placed 53.5 grams of methomyl and 60 grams of pyridine. The resulting mixture was stirred until the methomyl dissolved, The solution was maintained at a temperature of 200C to 250C, The adduct slurry was pumped into the methomyl pyridine solution with stirring while maintaining a reaction temperature of 209C to 25 C. Adduct addition was completed after about 1 hour. A reaction temperature of 20 C to 2500 was maintained for an additional four hours for the resulting mixture. Purification of product was effected as follows 300 grams of methanol was added to the above mixture to form a slurry. The slurry was then cooled to 50C with stirring.The slurry was filtered to form a filter cake. The filter cake was washed with 150 grams of methanol at 50C. The filter cake was then re slurried in 150 grams of methanol at 5 C. The re slurry was filtered and then washed twice with 150 grams of methanol at 50C. The cake was dried in a vacuum oven at 400C and 40 mm Hg. pressure. The cake consisted of 50.0 grams of product having a melting point of 1690C to 1700C.
