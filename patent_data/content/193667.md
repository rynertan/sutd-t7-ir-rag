# Adaptive array having an auxiliary channel notched pattern in the steered beam direction.

## Abstract
An apparatus for cancelling undesired signals affecting an antenna system. The apparatus includes a plurality of adaptive modules. Each module provides sum and dif ference signals 7, 8 from a pair of antennas 1 in the system. Each difference signal 8 is weighted by an adap tive controller 9 coupled to the difference signal via 4 and the apparatus output signal 16 . All sum signals from the modules are summed by 105 and all weighted difference signals from modules are summed by 10D and the total weighted difference signal is subtracted from the total sum signal by 11 to provide an apparatus output. The adaptive controller is a multiplexer 80 associated with each of the difference signals of the modules, a reference receiver 81 receiving a multiplexed information and a correlator 90 coupled to the received information and the apparatus out put. The correlator controls the weights 4 affecting each of the difference signals of each module. The output of the subtractor 11 is decoded by a main receiver.
