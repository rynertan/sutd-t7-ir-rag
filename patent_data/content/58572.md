# Spinneret for production of composite filaments.

## Abstract
A spinneret for use in producing composite filaments, comprises nozzles 27 for feeding at least an island constituent melt a combining chamber 25 having a horizontal bottom surface, into which chamber a sea consti tuent melt is introduced, the combining chamber having discharging holes 28 for the sea melt in combination with the respective nozzles 27 , each combination being con nected to an outlet 30 for extruding a primary composite melt stream of a core in sheath type or a secondary composite melt stream of an island in a sea type. The sea melt is fed into the combining chamber 25 through vertical passages 45 , the outlets of which are located substantially uniformly over the entire bottom surface of the combining chamber 25 . The extruding outlets 30 are grouped into respective groups, each group having the same number of extruding outlets and the extruding outlets 30 in each group are located equiangularly along a circle III. Each circle III has the same diameter, the respective circles having centres at which the outlets of the vertical passages 45 are located and being substantially equally spaced apart from the neighbouring circles III.
