## Description
The present invention relates to novel compounds having both diuretic and antihypertensive actions, more particularly it relates to 2,3 dihydrobenzofuran 5 sulfonamide derivatives, having remarkable both diuretic and antihypertensive actions with the effect of excretion of uric acid, and to the diuretic antihypertensives containing them. All diuretic antihypertensives are classified, by the actions and the structures thereof, to diuretic thiazides, loop diuretics, and potassium sparing diuretics such as antialdosterone type compounds. The dihydrobenzofuransulfonamide derivatives of the present invention can be reasonably classified to loop diuretics. Followings are the representatives of loop diuretic agents which are clinically used or are under research and development. US A 4 237 130 discloses 2,3 dihydro 6,7 disubstituted 5 substituted sulfonyl benzofuran 2 carboxylic acids and derivatives thereof having diuretic saluretic, uricosuric and antihypertensive pharmacological activity. The compounds of this invention are classified to the same family as the compounds finally listed above, This invention provides for new diuretic sulfonamides which can be administered orally at a daily dosage of 0.5 200 mg, preferably 1 100 mg or parenterally of 0.01 50 mg, preferably of 0.1 20 mg, and which have the following formula I wherein R¹ and R² are the same or different from each other, and each is hydrogen straight or branched chain C₁ C₅ alkyl, 4 to 7 membered cycloalkyl, unsubstituted phenyl or substituted phenyl whose substituent is halogen or alkoxy , phenyl straight or branched chain C₁ C₅ alkyl , C₁ C₅ alkoxycarbonyl or morpholino C₁ C₅ alkyl or Thiazide drugs, which are most frequently used as diuretic antihypertensives except for antialdosterone type compounds, accelerate the excretion of Na and Cl by restraining resorption of them at the convoluted tubule of the nephron this action gives good effect in the light of diuretic effect, but frequently causes various side effects such as hyponatremia, hypokaliemia, glycohemia, uricemia, and the like. On the other hand, loop diuretic agents cannot be used as a first choice drug because they occasionally fail in decreasing the blood pressure, or because the diuretic action of them is short in time although the action is both rapid and potent. In consideration of both advantage and disadvantage of those agents, the present inventors have studied to develop new diuretics to scarcely cause such adverse reactions, especially, as uric acid retention action or the like. The compounds represented by the formula I can, by the properties of the substituents thereof, be acid addition salts or the salts with an alkali metal, alkaline earth metal, organic base or the like. The acid addition salts include, for example, the salts with hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, perchloric acid, oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, malic acid, lactic acid, or the like. The salts with a metal or an organic base include, for example, the salts with sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, triethylamine, dimethylaniline, N methylmorpholine, amyloride, or the like. This invention also provides a diuretic antihypertensive agent containing either a compound of the formula I or the salt thereof as an active ingredient. In the formula I , the alkyl shown by R¹ or R² means straight or branched chain C₁ C₅ alkyl such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, s butyl, isobutyl, pentyl, isopentyl, or the like. Four to seven membered cycloalkyl means cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, or the like.

Preparation of the compounds of the present invention is substantially processed through the above summarized process 1 there could however be alternative better reactions in preferrance to said reactions in some cases of the substitutions of R¹, R², and R³. The 1st step shown above is recommended particularly when R³ is carboxylic acid ester, alkoxymethyl, or acyloxymethyl. Each step is explained below in detail. A dihydrobenzofuran derivative is chloro sulfonated selectively at the 5 position of the ring. The reaction can be accomplished by direct sulfonation with such a chlorosulfonating agent as chlorosulfonic acid, sulfur trioxide sulfuric acid, phosphorus pentoxide thionyl chloride, or the like or by chloro sulfonated with sulforous acid cupric chloride CuCl₂ Some of the starting materials II employed for this step are known compounds disclosed in J. Med. Chem., A 5 chlorosulfonyl compound III prepared through the foregoing step is reacted with ammonia, amine, or carbamic acid derivative represented by the formula IV to give the 5 sufonamide derivative I. It is preferable to carry out the reaction generally in such an organic solvent as alcohols including methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, or the like halogeno hydrocarbons including dichloromethane, chloroform, dichloroethane, or the like or ethers including tetrahydrofuran hereinafter referred to as THF , dioxane, or the like, under cooling or at room temperature, preferably at 50 to 15 C, more preferably at 30 to 20 C, for a duration of time between several minutes and several hours, preferably for a duration of 30 minutes to 3 hours. Ammonium carbonate in place of ammonia may be employed for this reaction. The reaction products can be readily isolated and purified by such usual techniques for isolation and purification as seen in the field of organic chemistry for example, elution, washing, chromatography, recrystallization or the like. The isolation and purification techniques may be employed for the products in the following steps. When R³ is carboxylic acid ester in the afore shown formula I , the ester can be subjected to hydrolysis to form the free acid I R³ COOH hereinafter abbreviated as I b . This may be shown by the following scheme. wherein R¹, R², R³, X, and X have the same meanings as those defined above, respectively. The reaction of this process may be carried out according to the usual hydrolysis for carboxylic acid esters. For instance, the starting compound may be reacted with an alkali such as sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, or the like in water or an aqueous mixture of water miscible solvent such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, t butanol, THF, dioxane, acetonitrile, dimethylformamide hereinafter referred to as DMF , or the like at room temperature or under heating, preferably at 15 to 70 C. The free acids I b obtained by the hydrolysis may, if needed, be converted to the salts with alkali metal, alkaline earth metal, or organic base as mentioned above. If R³ in the formula I is a special carboxylic acid ester, the alternative process could be better where the free acid I b thereof is prepared in advance of the subsequent esterification. The process can be shown in the following scheme. wherein R¹, R², R⁶, X, and X have the same meanings as those defined above, respectively. The esterification of this process can be generally carried out according to the processes for esterification of carboxylic acids for instance, processes that the carboxylic acids I b are converted to the activated forms with acid halide chloride, bromide, or the like , mixed acid anhydride acid anhydride obtained by the reaction with ethyl chloroformate, or the like , activated ester p nitrophenyl ester, 2,4 dinitrophenyl ester, pentachlorophenyl ester, or the like , and then reacted with alcohols R⁶OH VII corresponding to the esters employed or processes that the acids I b are reacted directly with alcohols VII in the presence of such a suitable condensing agent as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide DCC or the like. To obtain the acid halides of carboxylic acids I b, the acids may be allowed to react in such an inert solvent as benzene, toluene, xylene, or the like at room temperature or under reflux for a duration of time between several ten minutes and several hours by using such a halogenating agent as thionyl chloride, thionyl bromide, phosphorus trichloride, phosphorus pentachloride, phosphorus oxychloride, oxalylchloride, or the like in the presence of such a base as triethylamine, pyridine, dimethylaniline, N methylmorpholine. The solvent and the remainder of the reagents are removed therefrom to give an acid halide as a residue, which can, without purification, be used for the subsequent condensation with an alcohol VII. The condensation of acid halides with an alcohol VII is carried out by reflux for a duration of time between several ten minutes and several hours in such an inert solvent as benzene, toluene, ether, THF, or the like, preferably in the presence of an inorganic base e.g., sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate or an organic base e.g., triethylamine, pyridine, dimethylaminopyridine , under cooling or at room temperature. When an alcohol VII is phenol, its alkali metal salts, for example, salts with sodium, potassium, or the like can be employed where no base is required for this reaction. wherein X is a halogen atom such as chloro, bromo, or iodo and R¹, R², R⁶, X, and X have the same meanings as those defined above, respectively. The reaction of the carboxylic acids I b or the alkali metal salts thereof with halides R⁶X VIII or diazoalkanes R⁶N₂ IX can be employed as an alternative process for preparation of the ester derivatives I c. For instance, halides VIII is generally reacted with the alkali metal salts sodium, potassium, or the like of the carboxylic acids I b. This reaction may be carried out at room temperature or at reflux temperature in such a polar solvent as methanol, ethanol, acetonitrile, DMF, dimethylsulfoxide hereinafter referred to as DMSO , or the like. On the reaction with diazoalkanes IX, the carboxylic acids I b is employed as the free acids for the reaction, which is carried out generally under cooling or at room temperature in an ethereal solvent including ether, THF, or the like, or in a halogenated hydrocarbon including dichloromethane, dichloroethane, or the like. Representatives of the diazoalkanes IX are diazomethane, diazoethane, ethyl diazoacetate, diphenyldiazomethane, and the like. wherein R¹, R², R⁶, R⁷, R⁸, X, and X have the same meanings as those defined above, respectively. A carboxylic acid ester is reacted with a compound of formula X such as monoalkylamine, dialkylamine, ammonia, or the like to give the corresponding carboxylic acid amide I d. In this reaction, it is better that the substituent R⁶ of the esters I c is lower alkyl such as methyl, ethyl, or the like or aryl such as phenyl, tolyl, or the like. The reaction is carried out in an alcoholic solvent such as methanol, ethanol, or the like, at room temperature for 10 to 30 hours. The reaction may be subjected to the conditions under heating to make the reaction time shorter. As an alternative approach, the carboxylic acids I b may, as mentioned concerning the reaction in the Process 3, be converted to the acid halides which may be then reacted with the amines or ammonia mentioned above. When either R¹ or R² is hydrogen in the formula I, alkylation or acylation can be accomplished at the N position of the sulfonamides. It may be better for the procedures for the alkylation or acylation that the sulfonamide is converted to the salt with lithium or sodium by reaction with lithium hydride, sodium hydride, sodium amide, or the like at the N H, and the salt is subjected to the reaction with an alkylating agent ethyl bromide, propyl bromide, or the like or an acylating agent ethyl chloroformate or the like . The reaction is generally carried out in an aprotic polar solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, DMSO, DMF, or the like, at 30 to 50 C preferably at a temperature between ice cooling temperature and room temperature, for 1 to 3 hours. It is needless to say that if there is any susceptible functional group in the molecular of the compound, those reactions should be carried out after it is protected by a suitable protecting group. The compounds where R³ is CH₂OH in the formula I may be prepared directly from the starting materials II R³ CH₂OH according to the manner explained in the Process 1 or from the compounds I R³ lower aliphatic acyloxymethyl by hrdrolysis as shown in the following scheme. wherein R ⁵ is aliphatic acyloxy, and R¹, R², X, and X have the same meanings as those defined above, respectively. The hydrolysis can be subjected to the same conditions as the hydrolysis for the carboxylic acid esters explained in the Process 2. Wherein R⁹ is lower alkyl, X is halogen atom, and R¹, R², X, and X have the same meanings as those defined above, respectively. The compounds I i are treated with lithium hydride, sodium hydride, sodium amide, or the like to form, at the position of hydroxy, their alkali metal salts such as lithium salts, sodium salts, or the like, which is then reacted with halogenated alkyls R⁹X XI to give the ether derivatives I j. The reaction may be carried out in such an aprotic solvent as ether, THF, DMF, DMSO, acetonitrile, or the like at 30 to 50 C preferably between under ice cooling and at room temperature, for 10 to 30 hours. The ether derivatives I j can be also prepared from the compounds II R³ alkoxymethyl in the same manner as in the Process 1. Wherein Y is halogen atom and R¹, R², X, and X have the same meanings as those defined above, respectively. The hydroxy compounds I i are treated with a halogenating agent to form their halogenated derivatives I k. The reaction may be carried out under the same conditions as usual halogenation of alcohols where, for example, thionyl chloride, thionyl bromide, phosphorus trichloride, phosphorus tribromide, phosphorus pentachloride, phosphorus pentabromide, phophorus oxychloride, phosphorus oxybromide, or the like is employed as the halogenating agent. Furthermore, the reaction may be carried out in such a solvent as benzene, toluene, xylene, THF, chloroform, dichloromethane, dichloroethane, DMF, pyridine, N methylmorpholine at room temperature or under heating. In the foregoing reactions, it is a matter of course that a specific functional group may, if necessary, be protected in a conventional manner, and if unnecessary, may, in traverse, be removed both the selection of the protecting group employed and the manner for protection or removal of them are well known to a person ordinary skilled in the art.
