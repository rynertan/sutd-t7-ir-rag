# THERAPEUTIC DEVICE FOR BODY STRETCHING

## Abstract
Disclosed is a therapeutic device 2 by the use of which a person may hang in an upside down posture, with the spine straight, and in complete relaxation. The device 2 comprises a pivotable table 3 mounted on a frame 4 and having a knee platform 7 on which the person first kneels a tigh platform 8 against which he next rests his thighs and a torso platform 9 for supporting his chest and head as he leans forwards. Handles 18 , mounted on the frame 4 , are graspable by the person to pull himself forwardly downwardly by controlled tilting of the table 3 to a freely hanging, or any intermediate inverted, position. Relaxation while hanging is achieved by bending at the hips and by the provision of a behind the knee restraint 20 , which comprises a pad 29 that fits in the crook of the bent knee. This restraint 20 allows the body weight to be taken entirely by the thighs without the thighs being pulled off the thigh platform 8 by the weight of the torso. The device is adjustable in various ways to suit the individual.
