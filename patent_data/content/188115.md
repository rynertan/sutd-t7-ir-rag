# Preparation of transition metal salt compositions of organic carboxylic acids.

## Abstract
A process for preparing transition metal salt composi tions of organic carboxylic acids having improved properties wherein the transition metal is one capable of having a multiplicity of oxidation states is described. The process comprises the steps of a providing at least one transition metal compound wherein the transition metal is at one of its higher positive oxidation states, b treating said transition metal compound with at least one reducing agent forming an intermediate containing the transition metal in a lower positive oxidation state, c reacting said intermediate with at least one organic carboxylic acid to form the transition metal salt of said carboxylic acid, and d mixing said transition metal salt formed in step c with i at least one antioxidant, or ii at least one additional metal salt wherein the additional metal is more electronegative than the transition metal, or iii mixtures of i and ii . The transition metal salt composi tions prepared in accordance with the process of the invention are useful in a variety of applications including resins, inks, paints, lubricants and fuels.
