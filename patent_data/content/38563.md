# OPTICAL SYSTEM WITH HIGH COUPLING EFFICIENCY, IN PARTICULAR FOR ATTENUATION MEASUREMENT APPARATUSES EMPLOYING THE BACK SCATTERING TECHNIQUE

## Abstract
The optical system comprises a pair of cylindrical lenses located between two microscope objectives focusing at the fibre input face the light from a source with a rectangular emitting surface. The two cylindrical lenses have a common focus, they are oriented with their generatrices parallel to the major side of the rectangle and have such focal lengths that the whole optical system gives an image of the source in which the dissymmetry of the sides is reduced.
