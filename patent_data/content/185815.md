# Infrared remote telephone system level control.

## Abstract
A telephone system having a remote microphone 82 and associated transmitter 80 , and a network located receiver 60 for signals outgoing over the telephone network and including a local loudspeaker 28 to broadcast signals incoming over the telephone network wherein the loud speaker audio level is controlled to vary with the level of the received microphone signal increases, and vice versa, allow ing the user to control the loudspeaker level by adjusting mouth to microphone distance or speech loudness. In parti cular implementation the signal applied to the network from the remote microphone receiver is automatically attenuated above a certain level to match network requirements. The degree of attenuation is used to cause a corresponding increase in the loudspeaker volume level. Harmful feedback is avoided since loop gain remains constant. Proper mic rophone signal level and loudspeaker volume are assured by the reflex reaction of bringing the microphone closer to the mouth or speaking louder if loudspeaker volume is too soft.
