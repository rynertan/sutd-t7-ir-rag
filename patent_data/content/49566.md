## Description
BUILDING CONSTRUCTION SYSTEMS AND METHODS This invention generally relates to building construction systems and methods of constructing buildings.More partiollarly, this invention involves the general concept of use of low cost multiple. individual structural units, such as hotel and motel rooms, apartments, offices or the like, within an enclosing low cost outer structure or shell comprising a concrete foundation and floor, side walls and a roof. A continuing problem in the building construction art is the lack of low cost building constructions and methods of construction. Another continuing problem in this art is the lack of security for tenants and users of buildings. Still another continuing problem is the high cost and unavailability of energy products for heating and cooling of buildings. These problems are particularly acute with respect to multiple unit buildings. While the known prior art, as illustrated by United States Patents of Santoro 3623296, Steele 3839833, and Moore Jr. 4078343, indicates that some attempts have been made heretofore to solve some of these problems, the present invention provides a unique and more complete solution thereto. The purpose of this invention is to solve these problems by utilizing an outer shell or enclosing unit of low cost construction to enclose individual units of low cost construction and by utilizing low cost methods of construction. In general, the presently preferred method of this invention involves initial construction of a low cost outer shell unit of desired configuration. Then low cost individual units of desired configuration and design may be constructed and or arranged within the outer shell unit. As a result the environment within and access to the interior of the outer shell unit may be selectively controlled. In addition, the individual units do not require the use of high cost exterior finishing materials such as siding, paint and roofing materials and the like. The methods and construction of the present invention provide many advantages over conventional methods and construction. The interior units are protected from wind and precipitation. Therefore the heat loss from the interior units is reduced because the interior units are protected from wind loads and resulting convection heat losses.Additionally, any heat loss from the interior unit is a heat gain to the inside of the exterior building and thus the exterior building temperature rises. This, in turn, reduces the heat loss from the interior units. If interior units are at a temperature T1 and the exterior building is at a temperature T2 when T1 is greater than T2 then heat will be lost in proportion to T1 T2 . However, as heat is lost to T2, T2 will become larger reducing the value of T1 T2 and therefore reducing heat loss, i.e., heat lost from T1 is not really lost because it makes the exterior building warmer. The only real heat loss is from the exterior building to the outside environment. The same advantage applies for cooling by air conditioning.If only interior units are air conditioned and the resultant heat rejection is located outside the exterior building, the air conditioning units work against lower temperature environment, i.e., the inside of the exterior building will be cooler than the atmosphere when there is either a natural or fan recirculating system for the exterior building. The exterior building may also be designed and oriented as a solar collector. Therefore, the amount of energy required to heat the interior units can be considerably reduced. Construction costs are reduced because the methods and construction of the present invention enable accurate project scheduling particularly in geographic locations having short construction seasons because of weather conditions. The exterior building can be erected in very short time spans and the interior units assembled, constructed, erected and finished within the exterior building independent of weather conditions. In addition, by using a mall arrangement of the interior units, mass production methods, such as a moving assembly line technique, may be employed for fabrication and installation of the interior units with wall sections assembled on a movable platform and moved into place at the proper location, i.e., a prefabricated housing factory can be set up in the exterior building.By leaving one end of the exterior building open during construction, prefabricated units can also be brought in and simply set in place in the exterior building. In certain situations, it is contemplated that the interior units could be fabricated, tepporarily weather protected, and set in place. The exterior building could then be constructed around the interior units and temporary weather protection removed. The interior units can be decoratively finished at considerably reduced cost since they are not exposed to weather. Materials normally used only in the interiors of buildings can be used on the exteriors of the interior units. This provides not only less expensive finishes but a wider variety of finishes. The exterior building may be constructed in any conventional manner and employ any conventional materials.The presently preferred exterior building unit is a conventional structure employing prefabricated metal materials such as available from the Butler Manufacturing Company ofKansas City, Missouri and sold under the trademark Widespan.Such systems comprise a rigid frame of prefabricated metallic structural members providing a pitched roof profile. The buildings may be constructed in a variety of widths, heights, lengths, with a variety of structural design options, including a variety of roof and wall system choices. The roof may be flat or of varied slope. The roof style presently preferred is that with a high roof slope, i.e., 4 on 12 , to provide ample gable area for ventilation and overhead installation of utilities and lighting fixtures while also creating a studio ceiling effect. The basic components of this type of exterior building comprise corner columns, intermediate longitudinally spaced arch like frames consisting of oppositely spaced vertical columns spanned by roof beams, and end wall frames mounted between the corner columns. The intermediate frames support roof structurals purlins and side wall structurals girts .Columns and roof beams are made of metallic material with I shape cross sections which may be uniform or tapered depending on the particular structural system to be used. The end wall frames are usually lighter than the intermediate frames and comprise a simple beam and post end wall frame mounted on corner columns. End wall roof beams extend between corner columns. The roof and side wall structurals are made of relatively light weight metallic material having a Z shape cross section. The roof structurals may be single span extending between adjacent ones of the roof beams or in a continuous configuration extending the entire length of the building to support prefabricated metallic roof panels thereon. The side wall structurals are fastened to the columns of the intermediate frames, the corner columns and the end wall posts to support prefabricated metallic wall panels. The side wall structurals are available as simple stands or continuous stands.The prefabricated roof and side wall panels may be insulated and made of varying materials, such as concrete, metal, wood, of varying designs with varying factory applied color finishes. A variety of accessories are available including ventilators, light panels, gutter, gable and eave trim, and overhangs and canopies. While the aforedescribed prefabricated metal building structure is presently generally preferred for use as the exterior building of the present invention, it is to be understood that other types of exterior building structure may be utilized. For example, the exterior building may have masonry walls with roof supporting wooden or steel girders of conventional construction, preferably prefabricated, and a shingle roof of convenional construction. The size and shape of the exterior building may be varied as necessary or desirable depending upon the size and shape and topography of the building site as well as the number and kinds of interior units to be provided therewithin. In order to reduce construction costs and maximize utilization of the interior space of the exterior building, a polygonally shape exterior building configuration is presently considered to be most advantageous. In one form of the invention, the exterior structure comprises at least one rectangularly shaped exterior building having relatively long, spaced, parallel, side walls and relatively short end walls. The exterior building may comprise a plurality of rectangularly shaped wing portions extending outwardly from a central connecting area.The interior units are arranged therewithin in parallel spaced rows with each row extending along one of the opposite side walls of the exterior building to provide a central elongated mall area between the rows and each interior unit has an outermost exterior side wall located in juxtaposition to the associated one of the side walls of the exterior building. In one form of the invention, each interior unit has at least one window opening in the outermost exterior side wall portion associated with a corresponding window opening in the adjacent side wall portion of the exterior building. Each interior unit also has at least one door opening in an innermost mall side wall to enable access to and from the mall area. The individual interior units of each row are preferably arranged in side by side abutting relationship with adjacent units having a common lateral side wall. Each row preferably comprises multiple level individual units with a common ceiling floor structure between vertically adjacent individual units. The various level units may be directly connected to the mall area by stairways or by walkways and decks located above the floor of the mall area. In the most economical form of construction, the concrete floor of the exterior building serves as the floor of the lower level interior units which may be covered with carpet or title. A common support joist structure is provided for conventional ceiling materials for the lower level units and for conventional floor materials of the next above interior units. The uppermost level units having a ceiling support joist structure for mounting of any conventional ceiling materials. The side walls of the interior units are of conventional vertical stud and cross brace construction. Conventional interior wall and finishing materials are utilized but no conventional exterior wall or roofing materials are required which results in substantial cost savings.The only exterior walls of the interior units which need to be finished are the mall side walls and they may be finished with less expensive materials than would be required if they were exposed to the atmosphere. The ceiling joist structure of the uppermost level interior units may be uncovered or covered by inexpensive sheet material such as plywood or plastic with or without insulation depending on climactic conditions at the building site. Each interior unit may be provided with individual heating and or cooling devices or central heating and or cooling devices may be provided in common space. Electrical and plumbing lines may be located in vertical spaces along one of the walls of the interior units and connected to common lines located in space provided below the concrete floor or the mall floor. The exterior building may have heating and cooling devices located in any suitable place such as in the space above one or more of the individual units or in a space below the concrete floor or the mall floor. In general, any suitable construction materials and methods of construction of the interior units may be employed depending on cost decisions and design features selected by the builder or owner. The presently preferred and generally least expensive construction materials are conventional wooden building products. Thus, the wall frame construction may be of 2 x 4 inch vertical stud type construction and the ceiling floor frame construction may be of 2 x 6 inch, 2 x 8 inch and 2 x 10 inch joist type construction. Plywood, particle board and gypsum board products may be used for walls, floors and ceilings. In the preferred method of construction, frames are prefabricated at a remote location or inside the exterior building and placed into position within the exterior building.In most cases, it will be unnecessary to fasten the interior units to the exterior building or to the concrete floor but, if it is necessary or desirable to fasten them in place, they may be fastened to the concrete floor in any conventional manner. The interior units may be free standing because they are protected by the exterior building against any lateral loads and are permanently connected to one another whereby their weight alone is sufficient to preclude lateral displacement. The concepts of the present invention are illustrated in the accompanying drawing in which Fig. 1 is a schematic plan view of an illustrative embodiment of the invention Fig. 2 is a schematic cross sectional view of the embodiment of Fig. 1 Fig. 3 is a schematic front side elevational view of one wing portion of another embodiment of the invention Fig. 4 is a schematic end view of the embodiment of Fig. 3 Fig. 5 is a cross sectional view taken along line 5 5 in Fig. 3 Fig. 6 is a cross sectional view taken along line 6 6 in Fig. 3 Fig. 7 is a cross sectional view taken along line 7 7 of Fig. 3 Fig. 8 is a cross sectional view taken along line 8 8 of Fig. 4 Fig. 9 is an exterior cut away perspective view of another illustrative embodiment of the invention Fig. 10 is an enlarged floor plan view of a portion of the embodiment of Fig. 9 Fig. 11 is an enlarged plan view of one interior unit of the embodiment of Fig. 9 Figs. 12A 12B are an enlarged cross sectional view of a portion of the embodiment of Fig. 9 Fig. 13 is an enlarged interior perspective view of one illustrative form of the interior wall portion of the embodiment of Fig. 9 Fig. 14 is a schematic cross sectional view of another illustrative embodiment of the invention Fig. 15 is a floor plan of the first level of the embodiment of Fig. 14 Fig. 16 is a floor of the second level of the embodiment of Fig. 14 Fig. 17 is a schematic perspective view of the construction of interior units of the type of Fig. 9 Figs. 18 21 are schematic perspective views of a method of construction of another illustrative embodiment of the invention Fig. 22 is an enlarged side elevational view of the embodiment of Fig. 21 Fig. 23 is a cross sectional view taken along line 23 23 of Fig. 22 and Fig. 24 is a plan view of the embodiment of Fig. 21. Referring now to Figs. 1 and 2, a permanent building construction 20 is shown to comprise permanent exterior construction 22 of long span Butler type prefabricated steel material and a plurality of interior units 23. The exterior unit may have a plurality of wing sections 24, 26, 28 connected by a central common area 30. Each wing section comprises elongated spaced parallel side wall portions 32, 24 36, 38 and 40, 42, respectively, connected by transverse end walls 44, 46, 48, respectively. Closable entrances 50, 52, 54 may be provided in the end walls of each section and another closable entrance 56 may be provided at the central area 30 between side wall portions 32, 26. Each of the wing sections and the central area are covered by a roof 57 of sheet material or the like.Skylights 58, 60, which may be openable and closable may be provided in the roof. A concrete slab foundation and floor 62 or the like supports the side and wall portions. In the presently preferred method of construction of the building 20, the exterior structure is first constructed in a conventional manner by laying the foundation and floor portion 62 Then structural steel side wall and roof members not shown are mounted on the foundation and floor portion 62. Next the sheet steel material side walls, end walls and roof are mounted on the structural steel members. One or more of the end wall portions may be mounted at a later time to provide access to the interior of the exterior structure during construction and erection and placement of permanent interior structures therewithin as hereinafter described. The permanent interior structures are arranged in side by side relationship in spaced parallel rows 64, 66 68, 70 and 72, 74 along and adjacent to the side walls of the exterior structure Each row comprises a plurality of individual separate and separately accessible individual units 76, 78, 80, etc. Each row is spaced from the opposite adjacent row by an elongated corridor or mall area 82, 84, 86 extending between the end wall portions 44, 46, 48 and the central common area 30. Each individual unit is con nected to the associated mall area or the central area by one or more doors 88, 90. Each individual unit is also provided with one or more windows 90, 92 located adjacent the side wall portions of the exterior structure and associated with correspondingly located windows or window openings therein which may be preformed or cut in the side wall sheet material.The individual units may be of the same or varied construction and design. For example, all or some may be apartments or rooms comprising at least sleeping, kitchen and bathroom facilities or they may be office or store or recreation or common bathroom facilities or combinations thereof. In the presently preferred embodiments, the units are multiple level as shown at 94, 96, Fig. 1. The upper and lower levels may be connected to provide multiple level individual units or separated to provide individual upper and lower individual units suitably connected to the corridors or malls by stairways 98. Each individual unit may be provided with its own heating, laundry and utility facilities or centralized common facilities may be provided in the building in one or more of the individual units or in a basement area. In those geographic areas where it is necessary or desirable to provide additional air conditnoning, a central heating and or cooling system may be provided for the common space between the exterior structure and the individual interior units therewithin. The use of the foregoing building construction provides a large interior space which may be completely enclosed by a low cost yet sturdy and durable exterior building of any desired design. Since the exterior unit fully protects the interior units from the elements, the interior units may be made from less costly materials and constructed by less costly methods. After the exterior unit has been erected, the interior units may be constructed within the exterior unit without interruption of construction work due to climatic and weather conditions. Working conditions may be better controlled and more efficiency obtained than by conventional construction methods and techniques.

An entryway 453 is provided in end wall 405.Exterior windows 454, 456, 458, 460, etc., may be mounted in the masonry walls 402, 404 or the interior unit walls 450, 452. Referring now to Fig. 17, the general construction of the interior units of the present invention is illustrated by reference to partially constructed adjacent multiple level interior structures 460, 461 which are of conventional wooden frame construction as previously described. Structure 460 is shown with the framing of a lower level unit 462 completed and only the interior mall side wall frame 464 of an upper level unit completed. The ceiling board 466 of the lower level unit has been mounted beneath ceiling floor joist members 468 and some of the floor board 470 of the upper level unit has been mounted on the joist members. The framing of structure 461 has been completed to define a lower level unit 472 and an upper level unit 473. Side wall frame portions 474, 476 may be common to adjacent units 462, 474. Referring now to Figs. 18 24, another alternative embodiment of the invention is shown to comprise an exterior structure 500 of pre fabricated concrete construction including side walls 502, 504, made from vertically extending panels 506, 508 mounted between corner columns 510, 512, 514, 516 and supported by footings 518, 520. Cross beams 521, 522 extend between the corner columns and support concrete roof panels 523. In addition, a pair of vertical columns 524, 526 and stair well panels 528, 530 are located opposite one another. A central roof panel 532 is extended to connect with each stairwell panel. A pair of T shape vertical walls 534, 536 are centrally located within the exterior structure as shown in Fig. 24.When the exterior structure has been constructed as illustrated in Fig. 18 opposite ends 538, 539 are left open to receive a plurality of prefabricated modular interior units 540 547, etc. which may be of a size and shape to enable transportation by truck. Outer units 540, 542, 544, 546, etc. are constructed and arranged to be joined with inner units 541, 543, 545, 547, etc. to form individual apartments or the like as illustrated in Figs. 19 24. The interior units are inserted into the exterior structure, as illustrated in Fig.20, and then the stairs and balconies 548, 549 are constructed as illustrated in Figs. 21 22. As shown in Figs 23 24, the interior units are constructed and arranged to be located in the exterior structure 500 with one side wall 550, 551 of each unit abutting a portion of one of the side walls of the exterior structure, a front wall 552 of each outer unit facing the open ends 538, 539, a side wall 554 of each inner unit spaced a substantial distance from the adjacent side wall 555 of the next adjacent unit to provide a common area 556 therebetween, and a rear wall 557 of each inner unit in substantially side by side relationship but spaced from the rear wall 558 of the next adjacent inner unit. In this manner, a mechanical and electrical chase 559 extends between the rear walls of the inner units which enables all electrical, plumbing and heating connections for all units to be made in pigtail fashion. The kitchen and bathroom areas 560, 562 are located in the inner units adjacent the inner wall 557. The construction and arrangement is such that only front wall 552 of each outer unit is a completely exterior wall requiring an exterior type finish. In the illustrative embodiment of Figs. 18 24, eight apartment type interior structures 564 are provided by eight outer units 540 and eight inner units 541, Fig. 19.There are four lower level apartment structures, which may be supported on the ground or on a concrete floor, and four upper level apartment structures which are supported on the lower level apartment structures. The interior units may be placed in the exterior structure by any suitable construction equipment such as lift trucks, cranes, skid devices, etc. The foregoing embodiments of the present invention are intended to be illustrative and it is intended that the following claims be construed to include other alternative embodiments except insofar as limited by the prior art.
