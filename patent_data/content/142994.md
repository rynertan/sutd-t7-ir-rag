# PAGE MAKE UP SYSTEM

## Abstract
Colour separations for use in page make up are pro duced by scanning an outline original in a colour scanner to obtain a first output with high spatial resolution, modifying the output for reception by a video graphic system, generat ing a second full colour range output with lower spatial resolution by use of the manual input means of the system, with reference to a display on the system monitor derived from the first output, combining the first and second outputs to obtain an output with the high spatial resolution and the full colour range, and producing the separations by feeding the combined output to the expose side of the colour scanner.
