# Semi crystalline fructose production.

## Abstract
A solid fructose product comprising less than about 2 weight percent water and greater than about 60 weight per cent crystalline fructose is prepared by combining an aque ous fructose syrup and a solid crystallization initiator and then contacting with air for about 12 to 48 hours. The fruc tose syrup comprises about 60 to 93 weight percent saccha ride with about 85 to 100 weight percent of the saccharide being fructose. The ais has an initial temperature of about 50 to 80 C. and a final relative humidity of less than about 20 percent.
