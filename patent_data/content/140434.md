## Description
Disclosure Among the drugs of the autonomic nervous system, the parasympathomimetic drugs, and above all the anticholinesterasic and the antimuscarinic drugs, are impor tant in the therapy of the illnesses of the gastroenteric apparatus characterized b spasm, gastric hypersecretion, hypermotility and in the therapy of atonies of the smooth muscle tissue of gastroenteric tract, of urinary vesica, and in the treatment of myasthenia gravis. Many of these parasympathomimetic drugs have the structure of quaternary ammonium salts which will be denomi nated hereunder also as onium salts or compounds . Unfor tunately, the bioavaiiability of onium compounds, admin. istered by the oral way, is nearly always unsatisfac tory, and however much lower than that consequent to the administration by the parenteral way. This insufficient bioavailabllity of the onium salts under examination is evidenced by the large differences in LD50 observed as a function of the various administration ways from literature references . For the butylbromide of scopolamine the followingLD50 values are e.g. reported for mice 15,6 mg kg by intravenous way 74 mg kg by parenteral way 570 mg kg by subcutaneous way 3.000 mg kg by oral way. Such values are, always for mice, respectively as follows, for prifinium bromide ii mg kg by intravenous way 43 mg kg by parenteral way 30 mg kg by subcutaneous way. 330 mg kg by oral way. The large differences in absorption and bioavaila bility observed as a function of the different adminis tration ways means, in the therapeutical practice, that oral dosages should be much higher than parenteral dos ages. Neostigine, e.g., is prescribed for parenteral administering in 0,5 mg vials on the average, 3 vials per day ,whilst the lozenge dosage is 15 mg per lozenge, and the daily dosage may be as high as 20 lozenges. Prifinium bromide dosage is 4 mg per vial, 25 mg per capsule, and 50 mg per suppository. Thiemonium methylsulphate dosage is 4 mg per vial, 25 mg per lozenge, and 50 mg per suppository. Emepronium bromide dosage is 50 mg per vial and 100 mg per lozenge. The limited oral bioavailability of said onium salts is confirmed by the pharmacodynamic researches car ried out on man, which have shown bioavailability rates by oral administration of the order of from 3 to 5 of those achieved by means of intravenous administration. Among the causes which have been considered to be responsible for such large differences in bioavailability, the reduced penetration of onium salts through the gastrointestinal mucosa, with consequent inhibition to reach the smooth muscle cellular receptors, is one which has found experimental confirmation. Onium salts are virtually insoluble in the lipoidal components of the membranes of the mucous cells of the gastrointestinal segment, and this is probably the most important barrier against the absorption of the same salts. It must however be outlined that it is generally recognized that the absorption of ionized drugs by the intestine takes place in a reduced amount and in an un reliable way this is particularly true for the drugs of the class of quaternary ammonium salts. Finally, it is well known that the absorption through the gastrointestinal tract can be conditioned by the quantity and the nature of the food which is pres ent inside the stomach, by the gastrointestinal motili ty, by the transit time, by the capability by the micro bial flora to deactivate the active principle, and by the metabolizing connected with the first pass effect. Purpose of the present invention is to prepare novel pharmaceutical compositions of such drugs, which give therapeutical performances similar to those to be reached by the parenteral administration way, but which are cheaper and better acceptable by the patient. In particular, according to the invention, the novel pharmaceutical compositions being searched for must produce a high bioavailability of the active principle and uniformity of hematic levels, properties which are absent in the compositions for oral use of the same active principles. In order to achieving such purposes, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition with systemic anti cholinesterasic, agonistic cholinergic and antimuscarin ic activity, characterized in that it contains a therapeutically active dose of a parasympathomimetic qua ter nary ammonium salt, and a nasal carrier suitable to its administration by nasal way. The structural formulae are described hereunder, for exemplifying purposes, of parasympathomimetic qua ternary ammonium salts, suitable to the purposes accord ing to the present invention. As regards compounds with prevailingly anticholine esterasic and agonistic cholinergic activity, the following are mentioned Edrephenium chlorideEMI4.1 Neostigmine bromide and methylsulphateEMI4.2 Benzpyrinium bromideEMI4.3 Pyridostigmine bromide EMI5.1 Ambenoniun bromideEMI5.2 The parasympathomimetic onium salts with antimus carinic action selected for use in the compositions according to the present invention comprise preferably Onium salts of esters of tropic acid such as atropine methylbromide and methylnitrate, meth scopolamine bromide and nitrate and scopolamine butyl bromide.Onium salts of esters of substituted acetic acids di substituted such as anisotropine methylbromide.Onium salts of esters of benzilic acid such as mepenzolate bromide, pypenzolate bromide, pol dine methylsulphate, benzilonium bromide.Onium salts of esters of phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid such as oxyphenonium bromide. Atropine methylbromide and methylnitrate EMI6.1 Methscopolamine bromide and nitrateEMI6.2 N Buthyl scopolamineEMI6.3 Anisotropine methylbromide EMI7.1 Mepenzolate bromideEMI7.2 Pypenzolate bromideEMI7.3 Poldine methylsulphate EMI8.1 Benzilonium bromideEMI8.2 Oxyphenonium bromideEMI8.3 Other onium salts which are suitable to the purposes of the invention are Thiemonium iodide and methylsulphate EMI9.1 Glycopyrronium bromideEMI9.2 Penthienate bromideEMI9.3 Methantheline bromide EMI10.1 Propantheline bromideEMI10.2 Prifinium bromideEMI10.3 According to the invention, the active compounds above defined are prepared as pharmaceutical compositions with a nasal carrier, which renders them suitable to be administered by intranasal way, with considerably better results than obtained by using the compositions intended for oral and rectal use, as far as an increased bioavailability of the active principle, and the minimization of the variations of the hematic levels of it are regarded, thus allowing these onium salts to be used at far lower dosage levels than usually employed for the use by oral and rectal way. A surprising feature of the invention is that, very clearly, these onium salts are very rapidly absorbed from the nasal mucosa into the systemic hematic circulation, without first pass metabolism. That is to say, an efficacious systemic anticholineesterasic and antimuscarinic therapeutical response is obtained. Each one of the aforementioned onium salts can be conveniently administered by intranasal way to warmblooded animals by means of formulations suitable for intranasal application, such formulations comprising the selected onium salt, in a suitable quantity to car ry out the anticholineesterasic, agonist cholinergic and antimuscarinic effect, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable and not toxic nasal carrier. The choice of the pharmaceutically acceptable and non toxic carries, which does not exclude the use of carriers traditionally mentioned in the art of nasal ad ministering, depends on the chemicalphysical character istics of the onium salt, on the required dosages, on the selected type of formulation solution, nasal gel, nasal ointments aerosol spray, and so on , on the stability of the onium salt, etc. The preferred dosage forms by the intranasal way are almost always solutions, dispersions in water base, such base being either gelled or not in any case, water may represent the main ingredient of the formulations. Minor quantities are employed in the forlations, of other ingredients, such as buffering agents, wetting agents, dispersing agents, pH adjustment agents, gelling agents and viscosity increasers. Compatibly with the nature and the complexity of the formulation, is it preferred that the formulation be iso tonic. It has been found additionally that the carriers with prevailingly aqueous base and at low viscosity, as well as those carriers which use propellants based on halogenated hydrocarbons, tend to increase the absorption rate. As examples of halogenated hydrocarbons, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorofluoromethane, trichlorotrifluoro ethane and dichlorotetrafluoroethane are preferred. The carriers based on gelled supports, on o r andW O emulsions, used for intranasal applicationorthrough nebulizing, allow effects to be obtained, which are more durable in time, without significantly penalizing the rapidity of such effects. Should the onium salts be not stable enough in the ready for application formulations, the active principle can be freeze dried on a suitable support mannitol, glz cine, etc , which will be dissolved and or dispersed by the suitable vehicle at the moment of the intranasal ad ministering only. Examples of the preparation of typical nasal compositions containing onium salts pertaining to the class of parasympathetic mimetic products are reported herein under. These Examples are reported for illustrative pur poses only, and are not to be intended as limitative of the invention.
