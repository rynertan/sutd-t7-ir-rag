# An electronic input board system.

## Abstract
An electronic input board system 31 in which informa tion being written on an input board 32 by a hand held writing instrument 34 can be displayed on a display unit by inputting to the display unit positional coordinate signals indicating the positional coordinates of the writing instru ment 34 with respect to the input board 32 , wherein the electronic input board system 31 comprises holders 33A, B, C which hold writing instruments of different colors whilst they are not being used, each holder being associated with a respective color of writing instru ment detectors which are associated with said holders 33A, B, C to detect whether or not each holder contains a writing instrument and a color information generator for generating color information for the display unit in dependence upon said detectors such that that holder from which a writing instrument has been removed to be used indicates the associated writing instrument color.
