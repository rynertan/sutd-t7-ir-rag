# A ball striking instrument.

## Abstract
A ball striking instrument of such a structure that at least the main part of the instrument is fabricated so that the mechanical impedance Z of the ball striking part takes a minimum value P1 in a range D of mechanical vibration frequency close to the frequency Nb at which the mechanic al impedance Z of the ball to be struck takes a minimum value P1 .
