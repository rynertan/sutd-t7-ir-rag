# Header height lateral float control for harvester.

## Abstract
A header height lateral float control mechanism for a crop harvesting header 20 mounted on a combine base unit 10 for movement in a generally vertical direction and for rotational movement in a generally vertical plane to permit the header 20 to follow changes in the ground contour is disclosed wherein a height sensor bar 32 is rotatabiy supported along substantially the entire transverse width of the header 20 and first and second tilt sensors 42, 44 are mounted adjacent the transversely spaced header sidewalls 21 . The control mechanism is opera tively associated with the tilt sensors 42, 44 and the height sensor 30 such that the header lift mechanism 26 is operated whenever the height sensor 30 is actuated and the mechanism 28 for rotatably tilting the header 20 can be actuated only when the tilt sensors 42, 44 indicate different relative ground changes. The control mechanism further includes electrically actuated switches 54, 56 64, 66 74, 76 that are interconnected to prevent actuation of the header tilt mechanism 28 whenever both tilt sensors 42, 44 register identical ground contour changes.
