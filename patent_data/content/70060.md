# Display tube.

## Abstract
A flat display tube 10 comprising an envelope 12 including a faceplate 14 on which a luminescent screen 16 is provided. An internal divider 20 divides the interior of the envelope 12 vertically into a front portion 22 adjoining the faceplate 14 and a rear portion 24 which communicates with the front portion 22 via a space between the upper edge of the divider 20 and a peripheral wall of the envelope. An upwardly directed electron gun 30 and line scanning means 34 are disposed in the rear portion 24 . The line deflected electron beam 32 is directed to a 180 reversing lens 36 which deflects the electron beam into the front portion 22 . An electron multiplier 44 is disposed in the front portion 22 adjacent to, but spaced from, the faceplate 14 . The electron beam 32 in the front portion 22 undergoes frame deflection by means of a plurality of selectively energised, vertically spaced, horizontally elon gate electrodes 42 . The pattern of energisation of the electrodes 42 is such as to deflect an end portion of the electron beam 32 to the input side of the electron multiplier 44 . The beam having undergone electron multiplication is accelerated to the screen 16 .
