# METHOD OF CUTTING OR MARKING AN ELLIPSE AND APPARATUS THEREFOR

## Abstract
Movement of a cutting blade or a marking element is determined by the combination of two circular movements which determine the major axis and the minor axis of the ellipse, the centre O of one of the circular movements is moved on the circumference of the other circular movement. The two circular movements are such that the angular speed of one of the circular movements is twice that of the other and is in a reverse direction. By making the radiuses of the circular movements of the two members variable, the ellipse of the desired angle is cut or marked.
