# A RESISTIVE RIBBON FOR ELECTROTHERMAL PRINTING AND A METHOD OF PRODUCING THE RESISTIVE RIBBON

## Abstract
This invention relates to a four layer resistive ribbon for electrothermic printing. The ribbon includes a substrate 1 having a heat transferable ink layer 4 on one of its surfaces, and on its opposing surface there is disposed a conductive layer 2 . Bonded to the conductive layer 2 is a resistive layer 3 . The resistive layer 3 is bonded to the conductive layer 2 by a layer of an alkoxysilane compound therebe tween.
