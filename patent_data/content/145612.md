# Fluidised bed reactor.

## Abstract
A fluidised bed waste water treatment reactor which in cludes a reactor tank 10 containing a particulate media, an array of perforated distribution pipes 29 disposed in a horizontal, parallel array adjacent the bottom of the reactor tank 10 , for introducing fluidising liquid substantially uni formly over the cross sectional area of the reactor tank 10 . The arrangement is characterized in that an inlet end of each of the distribution pipes 29 extends externally of the reactor tank 10 and the distribution pipes 29 are connected to gether by a header tank 16 positioned externally of the reac tor tank 10 . This arrangement allows access externally of the reactor tank 10 to individual distribution pipes 29 which allows blockages of the pipes 29 to be readily cleared.
