# A scrambling and unscrambling system for television sound signals.

## Abstract
An audio scrambler 70 operates on segments of audio divided from a continuous audio signal to rotate head to tail at M1 and M2 the string of information contained in the segment by an amount which is at pseudo random between the successive segments. When the segments are compressed at 6 and 7 to video format, the scrambled compressed audio signals are inserted into an unused line of the vertical blanking space of a television system for transmission with the video signals. The inserted audio is combined with decoy signals, also in the vertical blanking space to increase security of transmission. Concurrent scrambling of compressed audio signals and video signals is provided.
