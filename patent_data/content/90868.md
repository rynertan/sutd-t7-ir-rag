## Description
TEST FOR GLYCOSILATED HEMOGLOBINS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention The present invention relates to the field of diagnostic test compositions and methods, such as are useful in manual and automated systems, and, more particularly, to those tests useful in qualitative and quantitative determination of glycosilated hemoglobins in a liquid sample.Description Of The Prior Art Glycosilated hemoglobins HbA1 are modified forms of normal adult hemoglobin CHbA having molecules which contain four polypeptide chains, two a and two ss, thus being also identified as a2ss2 HbA1 is composed of at least three minor components HbAla, HbAlb and HbAlc. All three fractions have the same amino acid sequence, but appear to contain a different carbohydrate. Hemoglobin Aic is the major component ofHbA1 it represents approximately 85 of glycosilated hemoglobins. The HbA1 molecule has the terminal amino group of the ss chains bound to a molecule of glucose. This molecule is formed, in vino, by the following reaction EMI2.1 tb H C O SEP H C Nss SEP CH2NHss tb SEP I SEP I tb H C OH SEP H C OH SEP AMADORI SEP C O tb HO C H SEP SEP H2NHO C H SEP rearrangement SEP SEP HO C H tb H C OH SEP H C OH SEP H C OH tb HO C H SEP HO C H SEP HO C H tb SEP I SEP I tb SEP CH2OH SEP CH2OH SEP CH2OH tb glucose chain aldimine ketoamine form form Glycosilated hemoglobin levels, in normal adult blood, range from 3 to 6 of total hemoglobin, but can rise as high as 15 in uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, because HbAlc levels double or triple. The strict relation of HbA1c concentration to diabetic control has been demonstrated by several authors see, e.g. H.F. Bunn et aZ., Science, 200, 21 27 1978 . If a diabetic patient is in poor diabetic control, he will often have high levels of glucose and glycolytic intermediates in plasma and, consequently, within the red cells because they do not require insulin for glucose uptake. This rise in intracellular glucose stimulates the non enzymatic glycosilation of HbA. In these conditions, the stability of the covalent linkage between the hexose and the protein, together with the relatively long life of the hemoglobin molecule leads to an increased level of HbAl. Consequently, hemoglobin A1 concentration reflects the mean blood sugar level over the previous weeks. The periodic monitoring of HbA1 values can provide an objective and accurate estimate of the degree of carbohydrate control in diabetic patients, and allows the physician to evaluate the effectiveness of the therapy. Different methods have been developed for the determination of glycosilated hemoglobins also called fast hemoglobins because of their chromatographic behavior . These methods are based on colorimetry, isoelectric focusing and chromatography. In the colorimetric method of Flückiger R. Flckiger and K.H. Winterhalter, FEBS Letters, 71, 356 1976 , the hemolysate is treated with 0.4 N oxalic acid at 1000 Centigrade C . Under these conditions, HbA, quantitatively releases 5 hydroxy methylfurfural 5 HMF , which can be detected by the color developed with 2 thiobarbituric acid reading at 443 nanometers . This method has many disadvantages, such as the high temperature 1000C and long time 4 hours required for assaying a sample and the poor reproducibility due to the low stability of 5HMF and low specificity free sugars also react .It is considered unsuitable for routine work. Recently, P.G. Righetti et awl., American J. ofHematology, 4, 367 374 1978 proposed a modified type of isoelectric focusing, in slabs of polyacrylamide gel, for evaluating hemoglobin A1. In this method a 600 nanometer nm scan gives two completely resolved peaks, which can be integrated accurately for quantitative determinations. The method is claimed to be highly specific and reproducible, but requires expensive reagents such as ampholines, and expensive instruments the gel should be scanned by a spectrophotometer with a slit of 100 nm and equipped with a linear transport apparatus, and the areas under both peaks integrated by a minicomputer . This procedure, therefore, could be considered as a good comparison method, but it is not within the financial reach of a medium laboratory. Although some work had been performed earlier, the ion exchange chromatography methods now used are based on Trivelli s original procedure L. Trivelli et aZ., N. Eng. J. Medicine, 284, 353 1971 . In this procedure, a dialyzed blood hemolysate is added to a 2 centimeter cm x 17.5 cm column, packed with a weakly acidic cation exchange resin Bio Rex 70 . HbAla, HbAlb and HbAic are eluted together with a sodium phosphate buffer 42 millimolar phosphate pH 6.70 containing cyanide 10 millimolar XCN .After subsequent elution of HbA with a more concentrated developer 150 millimolar phosphate, pH 6.42 , HbA1 percentage can be calculated as the ratio between the absorbance values of the two eluates reading at 552 nm . This method is considered sufficiently reliable, but requires several days for the equilibration of the resin with developer, several hours for the dialysis of the hemolysate at 40C, and three hours of elution time. For all these reasons, this procedure is unsuitable for routine clinical application. Attempts have been made to provide products which simplify this expensive and time consuming method. Kits are now available on the market fromIsolab Inc. Drawer 4350 Akron, Ohio , Bio RadLaboratories 2200 Wright Ave., Richmond, Calif. andHelena Laboratories P.O. Box 752, Beaumont, Texas with which the HbA1 chromatographic determination can be carried out in less time and at less cost than was possible with the original Trivelli method. In these commercial products, the principle still consists in the elution of the sample from a cationic ion exchange resin, using a developer which is generally a phosphate buffer and which also may contain potassium cyanide.The columns are very small in comparison with those of the original Trivelli method, the sample is consequently smaller, and they are prefilled with a resin already equilibrated with an appropriate buffer. Hemolysates are obtained very quickly from whole blood, utilizing a suitable lysing reagent. The elution takes about half an hour or an hour depending whether HbA is also eluted in a second step or not. The.most common analytical procedure simplified which is used in routine clinical chemistry, therefore consists of the following steps 1 A whole blood sample is hemolysed 2 a small amount of hemolysate e.g. 50 or 100 p1 is applied to the top of a chromatography column which contains a weak cationic resin equilibrated with an appropriate buffer 3 the fast moving fraction of hemoglobin HbAl is eluted with a sodium phosphate buffer which may also contain potassium cyanide and 4 then, the slow moving fraction HbA is eluted with a more concentrated elution buffer containing sodium phosphate and sodium chloride, which may contain potassium cyanide. The eluates are read in a spectrophotometer, e.g. at 415 nm against distilled water or buffer.The percentage of fast hemoglobin Hbs is calculated by the following formula A415 HbA1 X 100 Hbs A415 HbA1 A415 HbA Alternatively, instead of collecting the slow fraction too, an aliquot of the hemolysate can be diluted with an appropriate volume of the elution buffer. In this case, both the eluate HbA1 and the above described solution total Hb are read in the spectrophotometer against distilled water. Hbs is calculated by the following formula A415 HbA1 x 100 Hubs A415 total Hb These commercial products have provided a way to assay glycosilated hemoglobins under routine clinical chemistry, but they have been subjected to criticism because of their poor reproducibility and accuracy.A check of one of the commercial products based on this method has shown that the percentage of fast hemoglobin found increases linearly from 100C to 370C D. Dixon et awl., Clin. Chem. 24, 2073 1978 .This can be ascribed to an incomplete separation between the two peaks HbA1 and HbA , which become closer and closer as the ambient temperature increases. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention provides an improved procedure for the ion exchange chromatographic separation of compounds, such as hemoglobins, by passing a separator composition, which includes an ampholyte, as described more fully below, through the chromatography system prior to the introduction of the sample to be chromatographed. The separator spaces the elution peaks or prevents undesirable elutions, making the determination of the eluted component s more accurate. When the assay is carried out using the separator composition as described in the present invention, the separation between HbA1 and HbA is improved such that the results obtained are independent of the temperature in a large range, i.e. at least from 15 to 350C. In accordance with the present invention there is, therefore, provided a method for the chromatographic determinaton of compounds, such as glycosilated hemoglobins. In one embodiment, the method according to the invention for the chromatographic determination of glycosilated hemoglobins is of the type having the steps of 1 applying a hemoglobin containing blood hemolysate to a column of ion exchange material suitable for the chromatographic separation thereof 2 eluting a first fraction of the hemolysate, containing the glycosilated hemoglobins, with a developer solution 3 collecting the first fraction so eluted 4 eluting a second fraction, containing the slower moving hemoglobins, with the same or a different developer solution 5 collecting the second fraction so eluted 6 measuring the amount of glycosilated hemoglobin present in the first fraction and 7 measuring the amount of slower moving hemoglobin present in the second fraction so that the percentage of total hemoglobin which is glycosilated hemoglobin can be determined, having improvement wherein 8 prior to applying the hemoglobin containing blood hemolysate to the column, the method comprises the additional step of applying a solution of a separator composition which includes at least one ampholyte to said column. In another embodiment, the method according to the invention for the determination of glycosilated hemoglobins is of the type having the steps of 1 applying a hemoglobin containing blood hemolysate to a column of ion exchange material suitable for the chromatographic separation thereof 2 eluting a fraction of the hemolysate, containing the glycosilated hemoglobins, with a developer solution 3 diluting an aliquot of the hemolysate with an appropriate volume of the elution developer 4 measuring the amount of glycosilated hemoglobin present in the eluted fraction and 5 measuring the amount of total hemoglobin in the diluted aliquot so that the amount of total hemoglobin which is glycosilated hemoglobin can be determined, having the improvement wherein 6 prior to applying the hemoglobin containing blood hemolysate to the column, the method comprises the additional step of applying a solution of a separator composition which includes at least one ampholyte to said column. The invention also provides a test kit to easily and quickly perform an accurate assay of glycosilated hemoglobins under routine conditions. For this purpose, the kit contains, in packaged combination, at least one chromatography column pre filled with an ion exchange material suitable for the chromatographic separation of a hemoglobin containing blood hemolysate, such as a weakly acidic cation exchange resin, and at least one container each of an eluting developer and a separator component, which can be in the form of a powder to be reconstituted or a readyto use solution. Optionally, there may also be containers of a lysing solution and a control having a known percentage of glycosilated hemoglobins. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Although specific terms are used in the following description for the sake of clarity, these terms are intended to refer only to the particular embodiments of the invention selected for illustration and are not intended to define or limit the scope of the invention. The term ampholyte as used herein is contemplated to include any product containing in its molecule at least one acidic and at least one alkaline group, whatever its kind may be. The acidic group s will preferably be a weak acid, e.g. one containing a carboxyl group, and the basic group s will preferably be a weak base, e.g. one containing an amino group. In particular, amino acids and polypeptides such as glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, glycylglycine or their mixtures are particularly suitable. In case of amino acids or polypeptides, products which have an isoelectric point ranging from about 4 to about 9, preferably from about 5.5 to about 6.5, may be used. The pH of the amino group may vary from about 7 to about 11, but is preferably between about 9 and about 10. The number of carbon atoms may be from 2 up, the upper limit being fixed only by the solubility of the product, and preferably it will be from about 2 to about 6. The dipolar ion is preferably dissolved in water, in a concentration ranging from 20 mM liter up to the solubility limit, preferably from 0.2M liter upwards. A volume of separator solution containing this ampholyte is added to the top of a chromatographic column pre filled with a weakly acidic cat ionic resin previously equilibrated according to the prior art, and the column is allowed to drain until the separator is completely eluted. This eluate is discarded and the pre treated columns are utilized according to the usual procedures for chromatographic HbA1 evaluation. The examples now provided are illustrative of the invention. One skilled in the art will be able to make such variations, substitutions and changes as may seem desirable.

A solution containing all the hemoglobins was also prepared 20 iji of hemolysate 5 ml of buffer . Both the eluate and the above described solution were read in a spectrophotometer at 415 nm, against distilled water. The HbA1 percentage was calculated by the following formula A415 fast fraction A415 total Hbs x 10 HbA1 The tests were performed with both series of columns untreated and treated with glycine solution at temperatures ranging from 15 to 350C.Results The percent of fast hemoglobins found in samples of blood processed at different temperatures are reported in Table 1 TABLE 1 CC Present Invention Prior Art 15 5.38 4.44 20 5.43 5.38 25 5.39 7.35 30 5.45 9.42 35 5.90 15.10Conclusion The data of Table 1 show that the results obtained with the procedure according to the present invention are practically unaffected by temperature. EXAMPLE Il The experiments reported by this example were performed by the same procedure as those of ExampleI. The exceptions are that a different resin, developer and ampholyte were used.Element Preparation Small plastic columns 4 mm internal diameter, 150 mm height were filled with about 150 mg of the cationic resin AmberliteCG 50 Rohm 4 Haas , typeII, previously equilibrated with 30 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.7.Analytical Procedure As in Example I, part of the columns were used without any further treatment and part were treated with 2.0 ml of 8 g dl alanine solution according to the present invention. Tests on a sample of hemolysate were performed in both series of columns as described in Example 1, except that the developer was in this case 30 mM phosphate buffer containing 7 mM sodium azide. Results The percent of fast hemoglobins found in samples processed at different temperatures are reported in Table 2 TABLE 2 OC Present Invention Prior Art 15 10.40. 9.18 20 10.75 10.84 25 10.82 13.36 30 10.96 16.10 35 11.66 19.79Conclusion The data of Table 2 show once again the temperature independence of results obtained by the procedure according to the present invention and the high variability of results according to ambient temperature when a procedure according to the previous art is used. Although it has been described with particularity, numerous changes in the details of the invention can be resorted to without departing from the scope of the invention.
