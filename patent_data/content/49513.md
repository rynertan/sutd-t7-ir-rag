# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CONTROLLING TENSION IN A MOVING MATERIAL

## Abstract
Method and apparatus for controlling tension in a longitudinally moving web of material between fixed mate rial feeding points, while maintaining the length of the path of the movement between said fixed points substantially constant. A pair of axially fixed material feeding rollers are positively driven from a common drive motor, with one of the rollers being driven at a variable rate of speed through a roller shaft mounted transmission unit having a variable pitch pulley located thereon at a spaced distance from the axis of rotation of the roller shaft. The variable pitch pulley is connected to the motor drive pulley by a flexible belt, and fluid piston means is provided for applying a constant force on the transmission means in a direction about the axis of the roller shaft to impose a constant torque on the variable speed roller, and to move the transmission unit with its variable pitch pulley about the axis of rotation of the shaft to increase or decrease the speed of the feed roller, thereby maintaining a constant imposed tension on the material in its fixed length path of movement of the material between the rollers. In a further embodiment, variations in tension on the material upstream of the positively driven feed rollers is controlled by provision of a displaceable roller which engages the material upstream of the first feed roller and is displaced in response to upstream tension variations to impart a corresponding force to the transmissions unit to rotate the same about the roller shaft axis and correspond ingly vary the speed of rotation of the roller to maintain a substantially constant total tension on the material in its fixed length path of movement between the rollers.
