## Description
The present invention relates to a method for brazing electroconductive elements onto silk screen printed bearing surfaces or the like, which is based on theJoule effect and contact resistance, as well as to a device to carry out the brazing of suitable electroconductive means.According to the present invention, both method and device are exploiting the heat generated in the brazing area by the Joule effect provided between one or more pairs of electrodes which are operating onto a suitable electroconductive element to be brazed to any support, also a conductor, when an intermediate binding means is interposed therebetween, as this latter will be melt by that heat and the desired junction carried out.A particiilar attention has however been devoted by theApplicant to the junction of an electroconductive element with a conductive coating deposited over an insulating bearing surface for example by a silk screen printing process such a coating being eventually reinforced by a further galvanic deposition, so that the brazed electroconductive element may be used as a terminal for electrical connections.It is also important today to turn one s attention to the junction of electroconductive elements in the field of printed circuits as well as thermal rear glasses of autovehicles, or windshield antenna and the like which are more and more diffused and wherein the jointed electroconductive element acts as a terminal for the neces sary connections to a power source. Referring to this latter case of application, four superposed, solidly jointed component members are to be listed, namely a base support comprising, for example, the front or back glass of an autovehicle a conductive coating deposited over the surface of that base support, for exz le by sil screen printing process, according to a suitable pattern and eventually reinforced by z further galvanic deposition an intermediate binding means which is also made of a conductive material and finally the electroconductive element to act as a terminal in order that this electroconductive element may connect the conductive coating to a power source.As well known, the glass surface is not in this case a plane surface, rather shaped according to the outward appearance of the autovehicle and functions to be carried out. The conductive coating deposited over the glass surface generally comprises a pigment of silver granules in a vehicle of low melting vetrifying materials, when a silk screen printing process has been preferred for the deposition, while copper and nickel compounds or the like are used for the deposition by galvanic process.The thickness of these conductive coatings is in any case of a few microns only, so that a skilled in the art may easily understand that the best care is to be shown in brazing a suitable electroconductive element upon such a conductive coating so that the necessary connections to a power source may actually be secured.Many factors affect the brazing operation and particularly the heat provided in the brazing area the opera tional pressure upon that electroconductive element in order that a sure junction of this latter with the conductive coating of glass support as well as the electrical conductivity therebetween may be carried out through the intermediate binding means the shape of glass support over the surface of which that conductive coating has been deposited.On the other hand, when a brazing operation is to be performed as suggested and claimed in the present invention, i.e. by exploiting the heat venerated because of theJoule effect, it is essential that the electrodes which are acting onto the electroconductive element to be jointed xrith the conductive coating of glass support through that binding means have by itself some suitable characteristics in regard to the material and shape and correspond to above factors.The brazing operation for the junction of an electroconductive element with the conductive coating deposited over a shaped glass surface has generally been performed until now by acting manually. The drawbacks of such an operation are not only concerning the best care to be shown by the operator and a long experience of same in carrying out a welding which is apparently regular and satisfactory, but also the operational times, controls of above factors, impossibility of mass production and furthermore the relatively expensive working.A main object of the present invention is to provide a method of brazing co iprising operational stages to be carried out in a timed and automatic manner, by first of all exploiting the heat gene ated in the brazing area because of the Joule effect provided between suitably spaced electrodes when a modulated low voltage is supplied and these electrodes are suitably pressed onto the electroconductive element to be brazed upon a conducti ve coating through intermediate binding means.As well known, because of the Joule effect a certain quantity of heat is generated in the area of the electrodes whe rein the electroconductive element is to be brazed and then transferred to that intermeaiate conductive binding means, so that this latter is melted between the opposed surfaces. A single solid unit is thus provided after the binding means is cooled.Another object of the present invention is to provide a device the component rembers of which are controlled by a central drive in a timed and automatic manner, so that predetermined functions of same may be carried out, subsystems being also provided for pneumatic as well as auxiliary electronechanical operations by means of suitable devices. Another object of the present invention is to supply a modulated low voltage to the electrodes, the value of which is initially higher and then abruptly lover after a predetermined time. The modulated low voltage values and times are previously regulated and then applied automatically.A further object of the present invention is to provide an electroconductive element which is particularly suitable to be brazed onto a conductive coating deposited over the surface of an insulating support and then car y out the functions of a terminal. The electroconducti ve element together with the jointed conductive coating may consequently be connected to a power source and the features of this latter member may be efficiently used. In order that the ground principles of the present in vention may be better understood by the skilled in the art and the real advantages of same may justly be consi dered in relation to the method and device, an embodi ment is hereafter described as an example which is refer red to the accompanying drawings.This embodiment con cerns an exemplifying device to be used to joint an elec troconductive element vith a conductive coating which has been deposited in a conventional manner over the sur face of a glass support, for example the thermal rear window of an autovehicle, the junction being carried out by a brazing operation according to the method of the present invention that is to say by explciing the heat generated in the brazing area by the Joule effect, and the consequent melting of a binding means interposed between the opposed surfaces of the elements to be jointed.A single solid unit is thereby obtained after the binding means is cooled, and the electroconductive element may then be used as a terminal to connect the jointed conductive coating to a power source in order that the thermal features of this latter may be utili zed. Description and drawings relate to an example only of embodiment to evidence the novel features of the present invention and not a limitation of same. Changes and or modifications are then possible and will also claimed when falling within the scopes of the invention.In the drawings fig.l is a schematic view of a brazing device to bra ze an electroconductive element onto a conductive coating deposited over the surface of a base support, that view being limited to the component members specifically provided in this embodiment, so that control as well as electronic means for automatic operations are excluded as do not fall within the scopes of th invention fig.2 is a schematic top view of the main component members of the brazing device head, some parts being removed and or sectioned to better show some compo nent members or features of same fig.3 is a schematic e evation view from the right side of fig.2 relating to the main component members of the device head, certain parts being removed and or sectioned to better show some component mem bers or features of same fig 4 is a schematic elevation view from the front side of fig.2 certain parts being yet removed and or sectioned to better show some component members or features of same fig.5 shows detailed elevation and bottom views of one 1 razing pointed rod to be used as electrode in this device, according to the present invention so that brazing operations may be carried out in accor dance with the method which is also object of the present invention fig.6 shows detailed side, front and top views of an elec troconductive element to be used for junction pur poses according to the described embodiment of the in vent ion fig.7 is a front partly sectioned view of all the com ponent members superposed in the brazing area, a pair of electrodes being also shout in the form of pointed rods of the device according to the present invention.Referring now to the drawings and first of all to fig.l, the schematic view of same may give an idea of the provided operational brazing head composition according to the embodiment hereafter described, a vibrating systemV being also shown by which is possible to arrange in orderly alignment the electroconductive elements 22 to be consecutively brazed upon respective conductive coating deposited over the surface of a base support e.g.a thermal rear glass of an autovehicle, not shown , by exploiting the heat generated in the brazing area by theJoule effect,in order to melt a binding means 30 interposed therebetween.From the schematic view of fig.l and elevation view of fig.4 it is first of all possible to notice that device head 11 together with the whole of its component members is revolving about axis A A up to 900, namely between limit stop switches a, b, that angular motion being controlled by cylinder piston unit C1 as a component member of central pneumatic system P, the motions of the piston of unit C1 being, in turn, regulated by switch c.The limit stop positions correspond to the drawing of an electroconductive element 22 from the outlet of rec tilinear section V1 of vibrator V, its suitable tab 24 being then clamped against a shoulder 26 because of the angular motion of a suitable lever 27 about pin 28, as it will be recalled hereafter and putting that electro conductive element 22 down the pair or pairs of brazing pointed rods 15 15, l5 l5 which are operating onto coplanar sections 23 23 thereof, two pairs of brazing pointed rods being provided according to this embotiment. Another important novel characteristic of device 10 is to be added to that described hereabove and illustrated in figs.l to 4, which relates to the angular motion of 900 of device head 11. That other characteristic relates to the pending condition of the head and component members of device 10 as z unit from a bearing bar 16 in order to be moved about ideal axes which are perpendicular to each other. In this manner the pointed ends of the two pairs of pointed rods 15 15 and 15 15 may be better positioned during the downward motion of same as it will be recalled hereafter,and an efficient action of pointed rods may be provided also when that conductive coating to be jointed has been deposited over a not plane surface as generally occurs in the above cited cases of front or rear glass of an autovehicle. It is thus possible to place the device head 11 in that position which is more suitable for efficiently brazing an electroconductive element 22.As shown in figs.1 and 3, device head ll is connected to piston rod 33 of cylinder piston unit C2 and clamped thereon. by means of a screw nut 34, so that the head and component members thereof may be driven by said unit C2 for reciprocating notions.According to the illustration of fig.4, cylindrical pieces 16 are provided to guide such a motion, the respective top ends of which are clamped on bearing bar 16, while the guide by itself is obtained through tubular bushes 12 which are, in turn, connected to head 11 as a single body. On the ot ner hand, cylinder piston units C3 and C are 3 3 also clamped on device head 11 and act to move the pairs of brazing pointed rods 15 15 and l5Ll5 . In fig.4 a partial section of the sliding rod holder 18 is shown, in order to also evidence what has been provided in this example of embodiment, i.e. the use of an auxiliary disc 21 for the upward motion, as well as a cylindrical spiral spring 20 about bottom end 19 of stem 19 of the respective cylinder piston unit C3.A further particular attention is to be addressed to this sectional illustration of device 10 for what relates to the pointed rods and holders of same. Many characteristics are indeed to be evidenced as determinant to carry out an efficient junction of an electroconductive element 22 with a conductive coating 37 see fig.7 this latter being assumed as deposited over the surface of a glass support Sc according to a desired pattern, in this example of embodiment, as recalled above.These novel characteristics may be specified as follows a a final automatic and timed slide motion which is in dependent from the one to the other pointed rods also of a single pair 15 15 and 15all5 , so that an efficient brazing may be carried out by exploiting the heat generated by the Joule effect between said pointed rods as the end of each one may independently and rightly be adjusted onto the glass surface of any shape b a rightly regulated pressure of each pointed rod on respective plane section 23 of electroconductive ele ment 22, in order that the binding means 30 is flow ing because of that generated heat in the brazing area, as a predetermined length of binding means 30 has been automatically interposed at the right time between electroconductive element 22 and conductive coating 37 deposited over the surface of glass support Sc c a timed, modulated low voltage current is supplied to the pointed rods in order to provide and exploit the Joule effect therebetween in the brazing area of the electroconductive element to be brazed and there by melt the binding means d avoidance of negative effects which could be due to a superficial and eventually temporary coating of the pointed rod ends caused by repeated evaporations in the environment of same when repeated brazing opera tions are carried out, or by a superficial oxidiza tion provided on the plane sections 23 of electrocon ductive element 22 wherein the pointed rods are acting, or furthermore due to the environment conditions when these electroconductive elements 22 have been stored.Referring to above items a and b it is to recall here that the reciprocating motion of pointed rod holders and therefore that of pointed rods is pneun.atically provided by respective units C3 C3 and C31 C31, the central drive of which has the general reference character P3 in system P with a compressed air reservoir Pc. As premised, no detail has been shown in relation to the central drive as well as electronic logic by which the brazing device 10 is controlled according to a desired operational and timed planning.A first initial dorr ards motion of device head 11 together with the component members of same is caused by cz linder piston unit C2, so that the pointed rods are at pro aching the conductive coating deposited over the sur face of glass support S .When either pointed rods and c electroconductive element 22 already clamped between shoulder 26 and hooked end of lever 27 have reached .he right position for a brazing operation, pointed rods will further approach the electroconductive element 22 by owing to the control of cylinder piston units C3 C3 and C31 C31. pointed rod ends may thus press upon this element independently of each other, according to the above mentioned novel characteristics of brazing device 10.It is also important to point out that, while a relatively long strocke of each piston within respective cylinder is possible, only a portion of that strocke is actually utilized, in order that each pointed rod end may act onto respective plane section 23 with some elasti city and consequently with a better adjustment on the shaped surface of the glass support. This automatic behaviour of each pointed rod in regard to the pressure onto respective plane section 23 of elec troconductive element 22 to be brazed for carrying out an efficient junction with the conductive coating depo sited over the surface of glass support, performed through an intermediate binding means 30, is much more enhanced when each pointed rod end is properly shaped, as schema tically shown in fig.5. Also the novel characteristic reported in above item d is in this manner realized, as when such a shape of each pointed rod end is provided, the contact pressure results substantially independent of the pushing action upon the brazing area, so that the influence of this parameter on the NvelÅaing quantity is drastically reduced. The detailed, while schematic, views of fig.5 show the cut end of a pointed rod 15 as suggested by many experi menus of the Applicant just to avoid the negative effects as recalled hereabove. Referring now to item c , 2 modulated lou voltage is to be supplied to the pointed rods having the function of electrodes, and in accordance to the schematic view of fig.1 a transfonner T is thereby provided, the primary input being supposed as an eight input primary which is generally supplied by z line power of 220 V, some other voltages being obviously possible while the transformer ratio is maintained. Also in accordance with these experiments, preferred different values of that modulated low volta ge to be supplied range from about 2 2,5 V up to 3 V, different supplying times being also provided.To properly regulate either modulation of lou voltage and times of supplying same itching means S1 and S2 are provided, which are previously to be regulated according to the selected programing. On the ground of above recalled experiments of the Applicant it was for example de ducked that favourable conditions for an efficient brazing are resulting by supplying an initial low votage of about 3 V for a time t of 1 sec, afterwhich the supplying low voltage is abruptly lowered to about 2 to 2,5V during a time t2 of about 2 sec.In this manner, by the Joule effect between the pointed rod ends a sufficient heat is generated in the brazing area to melt that length of binding means u lich was in the meanwhile advan ced and interposed automatically between plane section 23 of electroconductive element 22 and conductive coa ting 37 of glass support S c As shown in figs.l and 3, a foot member 32 and a mechanical device are provided together to advance under the electroconductive element 22 a predetermined length of binding wires 30 30 to be melted during z brazing operation and then sharply separate the already welded length of binding wire 30 from the remaining wire 30 which is to be used successively. This operation is favoured by the action of c,rlinQ iston unit C5.In fig.3 is also possible to notice that binding wires 30 30 are sliding within corresponding sheathes 32 placed in footmember 32, ihile in fig.l is shoin that binding wire is supplied from a respective bobbins and atitomatically advanced in a desired moment through that mechanical device and the action of cylinder piston unit C60 The binding wire may consist of conventional lead tin compound.Further referring to fig.l it is to be added that the automatic and timed cisposability of each electroconduc tive element 22 is to be occurred so that its tab 24 may justly be taken and clamped between shoulder 26 and the hook shaped end of lever 27. In this example of em bodiment a vibrator system is provided the secton V c of which acts as a circular vibrator while section V1 acs as a linear vibrator, through this latter being possible to canalize consecutively the electroconductive elements 22. A regulator 38 for circular vibrator V c and a regulator 39 for linear vibrator V1 are also proe ded, this latter having also a photoelectric cell 40 to control the electroconductive elements in their consecutive alignment. It is also important to point out that through a probe 41 fig.l which is connected to one end of the transformer secondary it is possible to evidence if the brazing operation goes off in the desired conditions or inefficiently because of abnormal current flow. That is to say, it is, in this manner, possible to value the brazing qua lity already during the brazing operation by inspecting the current flow between the pointed rods. It will indeed be understood by the skilled in the art that an eventual current flow different of a regular reference evidences some anomalies which may for example be due to an irregular condition of the surfaces to be welded, as mentioned above.
