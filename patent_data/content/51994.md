# Medicament dispensing container.

## Abstract
A container for storing and dispensing small objects, such as capsules or pills containing medicament, one at a time, consists of an outer receptacle 1 containing, within itself, a delivery mechanism including a funnel shaped exit port 3 for capsules and a capsule or pill delivery tube 4 at the end of said funnel shaped exit designed to accommodate no more than one pill or capsule. This funnel divides the outer recepta cle into an upper storage compartment and a lower delivery compartment. The outer receptacle also contains between the exit end of the receptacle and the capsule delivery tube 4 a resilient means 7, 8 positioned to prevent or allow escape of a capsule or pill from the delivery tube. The inner receptacle 2 is pressed into the users hand which moves the resiliently mounted members 7 against the angled exit ramp 5 of the capsule delivery tube 4 delivering a single capsule to the user. The user then releases pressure on the inner receptacle 2 which at the same time releases the resilient means 7, 8 allowing them to return to the rest position thus preventing the exit of the second pill or capsule until the cycle is restarted.

## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTIONMEDICAMENT DISPENSING CONTAINERBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Packages for solid medicaments in the past have appeared in a number of forms and in various degrees of complexity. The common container used by pharmacies for the dispensing of pills and capsules is an open ended glass or plastic cylinder with a cap closure to retain the medicament when not being dispensed. The cap closure is sometimes a screw cap or alternatively may be a plastic snap off cap or any of a variety of child resistant closures that require careful alignment of cap position in order to remove it from the container. Such caps rather than simplifying the opening and closing of containers usually make the process more difficult. Certain of the prior art devices are especially designed to act as containers for the delivery of one unit of medication e.g. a single capsule or pill at a time. Such devices are disclosed in certain U.S. patents. With reference to the delivery of single capsules, U.S. Patent 4,154,365 discloses a dispensing container for single capsules which is essentially a pair of axial, telescoped members in which the inner member carries a stack of pills or other articles to be dispensed and the inner member may be reciprocated within the outer member between a normal, non dispensing position and the dispensing position. The tubular members have openings which register when the inner member is depressed relative to the outer member, to allow the lowermost article of the stack to pass through the registered dispensing openings by gravity. One of the drawbacks of this type of dispenser is that the openings must be carefully registered and held in place until the article drops out.Thus, with this disclosure and others requiring careful manual manipulation, there is difficulty, for a patient having limited or painful finger mobility, in using such devices.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a simple container for holding a number of capsule or pill shaped small objects and dispensing them one at a time. The dispensing device allows an individual with limited finger mobility to readily operate the device. The container, because of its unique construction, is especially adapted for the delivery of small objects such as capsules or tablets in a measured amount. The dispensing device comprises two receptacles one telescoped inside the other and a resilient means acting as a gate between the upper storage compartment and the lower delivery dompartment. The first of these receptacles contains ansupper compartment which is i separated from the lower compartment by a funnel shaped capsule or pill delivery guide termination at its narrow end in a delivery tube adapted to accomodate cylindrical shaped capsules or disk shaped tablets. The end of the delivery tube terminates in a beveled ramp acting as a delivery port and as a means for opening or closing resilient gate means attached to the inner structure of the second receptacle.The second of the receptacles is telescoped within the lower compartment of the first receptacle and is provided with bar members resiliently attached to the inner structure of said second receptacle. Said bar members, acting as a gate means, are positioned to slide against the beveled ramp of the capsule delivery tube when the lower receptacle is pressed into the upper receptacle to allow delivery of a single pill or capsule into the palm of the user s hand.DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION A preferred embodiment of the invention, particularly adapted for use with capsules, is. described below. The design of the present dispensing device consists of two receptacles, one telescoped within the other and a distributor plate. The first of these receptacles is essentially a cylindrical storage container for capsules having one end preferably permanently closed. Alternately this first receptacle can be closed with a removable cap or may be fitted with a locking closure which may be joined directly to the neck of a standard capsule bottle thus providing a permanently attached dispensing device for said bottle. This first of said cylindrical members is divided into an upper storage compartment and lower delivery compartment by a funnel shaped capsule delivery guide integrally joined to the inner walls of said cylindrical member and terminating at its narrow end in a delivery tube, the end of which tube is provided with inwardly beveled walls forming a delivery tube ramp at the open terminal end acting as a delivery port. The said cylindrical member is preferably further provided with a circular distributor plate or disk having a central opening preferably in the shape of a sexafoliate circle or a sexfoil, said distributor plate being closely fitted at its outer circumference to the inner walls of said cylindrical member and positioned immediately adjacent to the funnel shaped capsule delivery guide. A second receptacle of smaller diameter than said first cylindrical member is telescoped inside the first one allowing limited reciprocating motion within said first cylindrical member between a rest position and an operating position. The inner walls of said second cylindrical member are fitted with a plurality of arcuate members acting as an escapement alternately allowing or preventing the passage of a small object from the upper storage compartment to the lower delivery compartment. Said arcuate members have both concave and convex surfaces and are resiliently mounted on flexible rodlike projecting members integrally attached to the inner walls of said second cylinder and positioned immediately below the capsule delivery port.Said arcuate members are adapted to be closed together at their upper extremities blocking the capsule delivery port in the operating position and adapted to be closed at lower extremities and form a claw like cradle in the rest position. The resiliently mounted arcuate members are positioned against the capsule delivery tube ramp in such a way that the resiliently mounted arcuate members exerts a force tending to force the inner receptacle out of the outer receptacle. The inner wall of the outer receptacle and the outer wall of the inner receptacle are provided with opposing shoulders extending circumferentially around said cylinders to limit the reciprocal motion of said inner cylinder and prevent the escape of the inner cylinder. In an alternate embodiment of the invention especially adapted for use with tablets or similar disk shaped objects, the structure of the device is modified to accommodate the disk shape of the tablets. In this alternate embodiment the first or upper receptacle is fitted at the lower end of the funnel shaped delivery guide with a tablet delivery tube which is essentially rectangular in cross section to align the tablets in edge to edge order. The delivery end of said tube is provided with outwardly beveled walls forming a gate opening and tablet delivery means. Said upper receptacle and funnel shaped delivery guide are further provided with a fixed vertical dividing wall of diamond shaped cross section extending through part of the vertical dimension of the upper receptacle. This divider wall partially aligns the tablets for edge to edge entry into the tablet delivery tube. In this alternate embodiment the second or lower receptacle is provided with resiliently mounted finger or bar elements positioned to act as a gate to prevent delivery of a tablet when in the rest or non operating position and to allow delivery of a single tablet when in the operating position. In this alternate embodiment a second receptacle is also telescoped inside the lower delivery compartment of the first receptacle allowing limited reciprocating motion within said first receptacle between a rest position and an operating position. The inner walls of said second receptacle are fitted with a framework structure bearing resiliently mounted bar members. Said bar members are mounted at their lower extremities so that the tablet delivery tube is partially blocked by the upper extremities of said bar members when in the rest position.The upper extremities of said bar members are slightly enlarged in cross section relative to the lower and middle parts of the bar members. The upper extremities of said bar members are positioned against the outwardly beveled tablet delivery tube ramp so that said upper extremities are spread apart, allowing a tablet to escape when the lower receptacle is pressed against a surface, such as the palm of the user s hand. Release of pressure allows the lower receptacle to return to the rest position blocking the tablet delivery tube and preventing escape of a tablet in the rest position.OPERATION OF THE DISPENSING DEVICE In order to operate the device it is only necessary to press the projecting inner cylinder into the outer cylinder until the capsule drops out of the device. It should be noted that pressing the inner cylinder into the outer cylinder forces the arcuate members against the inclined capsule delivery tube ramp preventing the escape of a second capsule from the capsule delivery tube by formation of a gate across the capsule delivery tube port. It should further be noted that when the device is allowed to come to the operating position the resiliently mounted arcuate members exert a force tending to force the inner cylinder out of the outer cylinder.At the rest position, the ends of arcuate members adjacent the delivery tube ramp return to the open position allowing a capsule to enter the claw like cradle formed by the closed lower ends of the arcuate members in the rest position. In an alternate embodiment of the present invention the length of said arcuate members may be varied so that a measured number of small objects can be delivered at one time. It should be noted that the number of small objects which may be delivered at one time is directly dependent on the length of the arcuate members. In the further alternate embodiment adapted for use with disk shaped tablets, the device delivers tablets by pressing the inner receptacle into the outer receptacle until the tablet drops through the tablet delivery tube. When in the rest position, the tablet exit port is blocked by the upper extremities of the resiliently mounted bar members.When the inner receptacle is pressed into the upper outer receptacle, the resiliently mounted bar members are spread apart allowing a tablet to exit and said bar members exert a force against the outwardly beveled ramp tending to force the inner receptacle out of the outer receptacle.At the rest position the upper extremities of the resiliently mounted bar members partially block the tablet delivery port preventing further tablet escape. A special feature of the invention is its simplicity of operation for individuals affected by disease which limits finger mobility. Thus such an individual need only invert the dispensing device and press lightly against the palm of his hand thus dropping a capsule into the hand. It should further be noted that the container can be made of any suitable material preferably polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride, nylon, and the like. Preferably high density polyethylene is used for the body of the device, nylon is used for the construction of the resilient hinge member carrying the arcuate members, and polypropylene for the cap. As previously indicated, the dispensing device may be closed at the storage end by any conventional closure device. Non removable closures are preferred since the container is preferably filled by the manufacturer and discarded after use. The exit end of the device may also be fitted with a closure device such as a conventional screw cap, snap or a child resistant closure.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Fig. 1 is a front view of the medicament dispensing container in the inverted position for storage.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Following is a detailed description of the invention with reference to the drawings and wherein the same numbers are used to indicate the same parts in different figures. The dispensing device of the present invention comprises two main elements, an outer cylinder 1 and an inner cylinder 2 which is telescoped inside the outer cylinder. A preferred embodiment of the invention adapted for use with capsules is described as follows with particular reference to Fig.s 4 8 inclusive which show the internal working mechanism of the device. The outer cylinder 1, which may have one end permanently closed or may be closed by means of a removable top 12, and is fitted with a funnel shaped capsule delivery guide 3 integrally joined at its widest circumference to the inner surface of the outer cylinder 1 . Preferably a distributor disk 6 is positioned immediately above the funnel shaped guide to align small objects for entry to the funnel shaped guide and prevent jamming of the guide. The funnel shaped guide 3 is joined at its narrow end to a relatively thick walled capsule delivery tube 4 terminating in an opening provided by inwardly beveled walls forming a capsule delivery tube ramp 5. The funnel shaped guide 3 is preferably located approximately midway between the extreme ends of the outer cylinder 1. The inner cylinder 2 is telescoped within the outer cylinder 1 at the end enclosing the delivery tube 4 at the narrow end of the funnel shaped capsule delivery guide 3. The inner cylinder 2 is reciprocally slidable within the outer cylinder between two positions. First, an operating position as shown inFig. 6 when the ends of the inner cylinder 2 and the outer cylinder 1 are flush and second, a rest position shown in Figure 5 wherein the inner cylinder 2 protrudes a small distance from the outer cylinder 1.The inner walls of the inner cylinder are provided with a plurality, preferably four, rod like hinge supports 9 radially inwardly projecting and terminating in flat resilient hinge members 8 carrying arcuate members 7 forming a gate positioned in alignment with the longitudinal axis of the cylinder with concave surfaces of said arcuate members faced toward the longitudinal axis and convex surfaces faced toward the cylinder walls. These arcuate members are positioned immediately below the capsule delivery tube 4 so that one end of each member is in slidable contact with the bottom edge of the capsule delivery tube ramp 5 . Making reference to Fig. 5 and 6, it is noticed that in Fig. 5 the dispensing device is in the rest position in which the lower ends of the arcuate members 7 are brought together forming a claw like cradle suitable for holding a small object. The inner cylinder in this position is prevented from sliding further out of the outer cylinder by opposing ridges or shoulders 10 located circumferentially on the outer wall of the inner cylinder and 11 a circumferential ring formed on the inner wall of the outer cylinder. In Fig. 6, representing the operating position the inner cylinder is flush with the outer cylinder exerting a vertical force transmitted through hinge support member 9, and resilient hinge member 8 and holding the upper ends of the arcuate member 7 in closed relationship acting as a gate preventing the exit of small objects from the capsule delivery tube 4. In a preferred embodiment of the invention and in order to align and distribute the capsules as they enter the funnel shaped capsule delivery guide 3 , there is provided a removable disk 6 having a sexfoil opening 13 , said disk being closely fitted to the inner wall of the upper compartment of outer cylinder 1 and placed at the circumferential junction 14 of the funnel shaped guide and the inner wall of said outer cylinder. An alternate preferred embodiment adapted for use with tablets or disk shaped objects is described as follows with particular reference to Fig s. 9 11 inclusive which show the internal working mechanism of the device. The inner cylinder 22 is telescoped within the outer cylinder 20 enclosing the tablet delivery tube 24 at the narrow end of the funnel shaped tablet delivery guide 23. The inner or lower cylinder 22 is reciprocally slidable between two positions, a rest position illustrated in Fig. 9 and 10 and an operating position illustrated in Fig. 11. In the rest position the tablet is prevented from dropping out of the tablet delivery tube 24 by the enlarged upper ends 26 of the vertically mounted bar member 27.In the operating position represented by Fig. 11 the inner lower cylinder 22 and the projecting inner framework structure 28 is pressed vertically into the outer cylinder 20 forcing the enlarged head 26 of the vertical bar member 27 against the capsule tube delivery ramp 25 thereby spreading the upper ends 26 of the bar members apart and allowing a tablet to drop from the tablet delivery tube 24. Release of pressure on the inner cylinder framework 29 allows the inner cylinder 22 to return to the rest position. The inner cylinder 22 is provided with external circumferential rings upper 33 and lower 30.The inner cylinder 22 is prevented from sliding completely free of the upper cylinder and is held in position to prevent tablet escape by contact of the lower circumferential ring 30 with an internal shoulder 31 acting as a stop at the lower end of the external receptacle 20. This alternate embodiment in its preferred form contains a partial vertical divider wall 21 of diamond shaped cross section bisecting the upper storage compartment 34 of the upper receptacle and extending partially downward into the funnel shaped capsule delivery guide 23. This divider wall serves to separate and align the tablets dropping into the tablet delivery guide 23 for edge to edge entry into the tablet delivery tube 24 thus helping to provide smooth operation of the device. As it may be appreciated the invention has been disclosed in its preferred embodiments and it may be apparent by those skilled in the art that these embodiments are subject to modifications. These modifications will be considered within the scope of the invention which is limited by the claims which follow.
