# Opto electronic apparatus for writing and or reading recording tracks by means of a radiation beam.

## Abstract
The apparatus comprises an objective 12 mounted in an objective holder 11 which is movable in accordance with a number of desired degrees of freedom by means of a bearing arrangement and comprises electromagnetic actuator means 83 64 for driving the objective holder in accordance with the desired directions of movement. The bearing arrangement of the objective holder on the frame comprises electromagnetic bearing means 53 64 for coun teracting movements in accordance with at least one unde sired degree of freedom and comprises an objective position measuring device 43 50 for supplying a positional error signal which represents the deviation of the objective holder in accordance with the undesired degree of freedom relative to the frame 10 and which is utilized by a levitation control circuit which counter acts movements of the objective holder relative to the frame in accordance with the undesired degree of freedom by means of electromagnetic levitation forces.
