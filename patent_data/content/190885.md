## Description
This invention relates to a method of promoting flowering of broad leaved trees, particularly so as to overcome problems of irregular cropping, and most notably the horticultural problem commonly referred to as biennial bearing and to a composition for use in such method. Biennial bearing is a considerable problem with a number of woody angiosperms including apple, apricot, pistachio, pecan, coffee and several species of citrus. It can result in a glut of fruit in one year and very low production the next. The low crop in the off year is directly related to the failure by the plant to produce an adequate number of flowers on spur shoots, or on branches bearing fruit the previous season. If the tendency toward biennial bearing is not too severe, the problem can be controlled by the use of growth retardants, ethylene generating chemicals, girdling, and the aggressive use of manual or chemical thinning procedures to reduce the crop in the on year. However, severe biennial bearing cannot be corrected by such procedures. It has now been found that field applications of carefully selected gibberellins can promote return flowering . This discovery is particularly surprising because some other horticultural treatments involving gibberellins i.e. treatments to promote fruit set or improve aspects of fruit quality often antagonize the next year s flowering. Thus, for example, C.A. 95 127709j entitled Early involvement of gibberellins in the biennial bearing of early apples discloses that gibberellins A₃ and A₄ ₇ inhibit bud formation in both spurs and one year old wood of early McKintosh apples. According to the invention there is provided a method of promoting flowering of woody angiosperms which comprises applying a gibberellin as a foliar treatment at a rate of from 1 to 500 µg per spur or short shoot, the gibberellin being a hydroxylated other than at positions 1 and 2 and b C 1,2 dihydro, whereby it is rapidly metabolizable. The invention further relates to the use of a gibberellin in the manufacture of a composition for promoting flowering of woody angiosperms, the gibberellin being a hydroxylated other than at positions 1 and 2 and b C 1,2 dihydro whereby it is rapidly metabolizable, said composition comprising said gibberellin in an amount effective for application at a rate of from 1 to 500 µg per spur or short shoot, together with a horticulturally acceptable diluent or carrier and being substantially free of gibberellins with persistent biological activity. It is preferred to apply a gibberellin native to the species or an analogue of such a gibberellin , and one that is metabolized so rapidly that no unwanted morphogenic side effects, such as lengthening of the plastochron, are produced. As indicated, suitable gibberellins are those which are hydroxylated at positions in the gibberellane skeleton other than at positions 1 and 2 and are 1,2 dihydro. Examples of such gibberellins include gibberellin A₄ GA₄ and its salts and esters, the C 3 epimer of GA₄ and its salts and esters and gibberellin GA₁, and its salts and esters. Examples of suitable salts and esters include the sodium salt and C₁ ₄ carboxylic acid esters. The gibberellins used in accordance with the present invention may be applied with other plant growth regulators, i.e. chemical thinning agents and growth retardants, but gibberellins with persistent biological activity, especially gibberellins A₃ and A₇ should not be used. Thus, the gibberellins used in accordance with the invention should be substantially free of those gibberellins with persistent biological activity. Although the method of the invention may be carried out on trees which are not flowering or have not flowered e.g. to promote flowering of juvenile trees , it would normally be carried out during a season in which flowering and fruiting has already taken place, so as to stimulate return flowering . The intent is to counteract or over ride any inhibitory effect caused by the current season s flowering and or cropping. The application of gibberellin in accordance with the invention is desirably carried out in late spring early summer and, depending on the crop, probably not later than about 12 weeks after anthesis. Good results have been obtained with application of gibberellin in the period from 2 to 8 weeks after anthesis on apple. Although multiple applications of gibberellin may be made, significantly improved flowering has been achieved with a single application. The method of application of gibberellin is not thought to be particularly critical and may be accomplished by spraying the gibberellin to whole trees together with a suitable carrier. The addition of conventional adjuvants such as wetting agents and dispersants may prove to be beneficial in some agronomic situations. Only small quantities of gibberellin need be applied in order to stimulate return flowering in accordance with the invention. Satisfactory results have been achieved with as little as 3 µg per spur and it is expected that solutions containing as little as 30 ppm of the gibberellin will give satisfactory results when applied as foliar sprays. Normally the method of invention involves the use of a gibberellin as the sole plant growth modifying agent but the addition of a natural cytokinin, zeatin, appeared to enhance the flower promoting activity in one experiment even though previous tests by us of this and other cytokinins alone had not been encouraging . Thus, the method cannot rule out the possibility that the addition of other plant growth regulators might enhance activity. The invention described here has great potential for improving the cropping behaviour of fruit trees prone to biennial flowering and its success is particularly surprising since the weight of experimental evidence would predict the opposite. The method of the invention as applied to apple trees will now be described in the following examples. Nine mature 21 year old spur type Golden Delicious apple trees with a history of severe biennial bearing were selected during the 1982 blossom period from a larger population of trees in Orchard 1C of the Summerland, British Columbia, Canada Research Station. Each tree was judged to be on in 1982, with virtually every spur flowering. Thus, return flowering in 1983 was expected to be very low. To improve the chances of return flowering each tree was carefully hand thinned within 2 weeks of full bloom. Eighty percent of the flowering spurs were defruited and a single fruit retained on the remaining spurs. These trees received normal cultural attention during the 1982 growing season and the fruit was harvested in mid October. Care was taken during the harvest and pruning operations during dormancy to avoid removing or damaging treated spurs and branches. The following treatment solutions were applied with a small paint brush to 2 fully expanded rosette leaves on each of 25 defruited spurs randomly located throughout each of the 9 trees Each of these treatments was applied during the period of June 14 17, 1982, or about 4.5 weeks after full bloom. Treatments b to e were applied to additional spurs on the same trees on June 30, or about 7 weeks after full bloom. Each leaf was painted on all surfaces, applying about 1.5 ml of solution to each spur. Thus, the amount of GA₄ applied ranged from 0 to approximately 300 µg per spur. Treatment e applied 30 ug of GA₄ and 30 ug of zeatin. Early in the bloom period of 1983 each spur was examined for the presence or absence of flowers. There were no apparent differences in the number or quality of individual flowers per cluster so no detailed measurements of this nature were made. The flowering results expressed as a percentage of flowering spurs per treatment per tree were subjected to an analysis of variance of 9 treatments and 9 blocks trees . The 200 ppm GA₄ treatment, appled at either 4.5 or 7 weeks after anthesis in 1982, significantly increased the proportion of spurs that produced flowers in 1983 Table 1 . Furthermore, flowering was increased by 3 of the 4 treatments involving 20 ppm GA₄, and the GA₄ plus zeatin mixture appeared to be superior to GA₄ alone. The 2 ppm treatment applied 7 weeks after bloom was ineffective and the relatively high value resulting from the comparable 4.5 week treatment, although statistically significant, may be anomalous. The amount of return flowering obtained with the 200 ppm GA₄ treatments would be enough to insure a commercial crop of apples given reasonable conditions for fruit set and development. This treatment would, therefore, be of considerable commercial interest. However, of particular biological significance is that, contrary to previous results with exogenously applied gibberellins A₃, A₇ and A₄ plus A₇ mixtures, gibberellin A₄ significantly promoted flowering relative to an appropriate control treatment. Five 16 year old Golden Delicious apple trees exhibiting severe biennial bearing were selected from a larger population of trees in Orchard 1C of the Summerland, British Columbia Research Station. 1978 was the on year for these trees and to improve the chances of obtaining a crop in the following year they were severely hand thinned at 20 days after full bloom. On average, 19 of each 20 flowering spurs were defruited at that time. At 22 days after full bloom 60 defruited spurs were selected and tagged on each tree, and one of the following treatments was applied to 20 spurs per tree Each treatment was applied in approximately 250 µl of solution applied as a fine aerosol spray to the spur rosette leaves and bourse shoot. Adjacent spurs were protected from the treatment. Each spur that could be located a few spurs were lost during the 1978 79 dormant period was examined in early May of 1979 for the presence of absence of blossoms. The number of flowers in each blossom cluster was also recorded. The results were expressed as the percentage of treated spurs exhibiting flowers on each tree, and these values were analyzed with an analysis of variance of 3 treatments and 5 blocks. Spurs treated with C 3 epi GA₄ were significantly more likely to differentiate flowers than the ethanol treated control Table 2 . Furthermore, the response was related to the concentration of C 3 epi GA₄ applied 50 ug per spur being significantly more effective than the 25 ug C 3 epi GA₄ treatment. There was no significant treatment effect on the number of flowers per flowering cluster, with the average values for treatments a to c being 5.1, 5.24 and 5.22, respectively. The significance of these findings is that even where the tendency of the trees was to initiate a rather high number of flowers nearly 30 of the control spurs exhibited flowers compared to about 2 in Example 1 a significant promotive effect of the gibberellin treatment was apparent. Furthermore, the method of application differed from Example 1 In that more of the spur leaves were treated and the material was applied in a low volume aerosol spray. Experiments as described in Examples 1 and 2 were carried out to assess the effects on return flowering of GA₄ and GA₁ C 13 acetate applied at two concentrations. Statistical comparisons were made between trees with high and low return flowering in 1985 and between spurs which were with and without fruit in 1984. The results are shown in the following Tables 3 to 5.
