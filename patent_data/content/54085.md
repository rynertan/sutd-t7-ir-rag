# High intensity discharge lighting system.

## Abstract
An apparatus for connecting a high intensity discharge light to an electrical outlet has a plurality of end plates adapted to be electrically connected to an electrical outlet and to provide an electrical connection to the light. A heat sink means, and a cover means together with the end plates provide a protective enclosure for a circuit board having a ballast circuit thereon. The ballast circuit maintains a con stant current flow through the light as the light becomes operational and comprises a plurality of transistor means biased both simultaneously and alternatively into conduc tion as the light becomes operational.
