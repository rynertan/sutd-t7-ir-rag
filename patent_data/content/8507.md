To this, stirred slurry was added 12.5 g 0.097 mole of oxalyl chloride. The mixture was stirred for 3 hours and then heated to 90 C. The mixture was filtered hot and the solvent stripped off. The residue was dissolved in hot toluene and allowed to cool. The product crystallized and was removed by filtration and dried. The product melted at 157 1600C. Example 35 Stabilization of Polypropylene The antioxidant 0.1 parts by weight was blended intoProfax 6501 trademark of Hercules, Inc. for polypropylene resin 100 parts by weight on a mill at 3500F 1770C . This stabilized polypropylene was pressed into 75 mil sheets and then buttons punched from these sheets. The same procedure was followed in order to prepare buttons containing 0.1 parts of antioxidant and 0.25 parts of distearyl thiodipropionate. Three buttons of each sample of stabilized polymer were aged at 1490C 3000F in a circulating air oven and the days to embrittlement recorded. The break point is defined as the first sign of embrittlement or crumbling in two of the three buttons.Compound Days to Break Alone With DSTDPBlank 1 4 2 3,5 Di t butyl 4 hydroxybenzyl 2 4,4 dLmethyl 2 oxazoline trimethyl enebis 13 3,5 di t butyl 4 hydroxy phenyl propionatel 19 118 2 2 3,5 Di t butyl 4 hydroxyphenyl ethyll 4 ethyl 2 oxazoline 4 methyl 3 3 ,5 di t butyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propionate 24 59 2 2 3,5 Di t butyl 4 hydroxypbenyl ethyl 2 oxazoline 4,4 dimethyl bisl3 3,5 di t butyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propionate 34 90 2 2 3,5 Di t butyl 4 hydroxyphenyl ethyl 4 hydroxymethyl 2 oxazoline 4methyl 3 3 ,5 di t butyl 4 hydroxy phenyl propionate 32 50 Bis 2 2 3,5 di t butyl 4 hydroxy phenyl ethyll 4 methyl 2 oxazoline4 methyl oxalate 25 19 RTI ID 26.11 Bis 2 2 3,5 di t butyl 4 hydroxy phenyl ethyl 4 ethyl 2 oxazoline 4methyl oxalate 22 25 2 2 3,5 Di t butyl 4 hydroxyphenyl ethyl 4 l acetoxy methyl 2 oxazoline 4 methyl 13 3,5 di t butyl 4 hydroxy phenyl propionate 39 81 2 2 3,5 Di t butyl 4 hydroxyphenyl ethyl 4 l hexanoyloxy methyl 2 oxazoline 4 methyl 3 3,5 di t butyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propionate 28 111 Compound Days to Break Alone With DSTDP 2 2 3,5 Di t butyl 4 hydroxypbenyl ethyl 4 dodecanoyloxy methyl 2 oxazoline 4 methyl 13 3,5 di t butyl4 hydroxyphenyl propionate 37 104 2 2 3,5 Di t butyl 4 hydroxyphenyl ethyl 4 stearoyloxy methyl 2 oxazoline 4 methyl 3 3,5 di t butyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propionate 34 93 2 2 3,5 Di t butyl 4 hydroxyphenyl ethyl 4 1 benzoxy methyl 2 oxazoline 4 methyl 3 3,5 di t butyl 4 hydroxy phenyl propionate 1 39 68 2 Methyl 2 oxazoline 4,4 dimethyl bis 3 3 ,5 di t butyl 4 hydroxyphenyi propionate 27 68 2 n Heptadecyl 2 oxazoline 4,4 dimethyl bisI3 3,5 di t butyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propionate 28 44 2,2 Tetramethylene bis 2 oxazoline 4 4,4 ,4 tetramethyl tetrakis 3 3,5di t butyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propionate 27 98 2,2 Thiodiethylene bis 2 oxazoline 4,4,4 ,4 tetrainethyl tetrakis 13 3,5 di t butyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propionatel 41 91 2 Phenyl 2 oxazoline 4,4 dimethyl RTI ID 27.13 bis 3 3,5 di t butyl 4 hydroxy phenyl propionateg 34 133 2 4 t Butylphenyl 2 oxazoline4,4 dimethyl bis13 3,5 di t butyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propionate 27 69 2 4 Nitrophenyl 2 oxazoline 4,4dimethyl bis 3 3,5 di t butyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propionate 39 77 Example 36 This example shows the usefulness of the compounds of the present invention in stabilizing an ethylene propylene terpolymer and their superiority to the compounds of the prior art. The stabilizers 0.165 g were dissolved in a rubber cement containing 110 g EPDM ethylene propylene 5 ethylidene 2norbornene having an ethylene prapylene weight ratio of 67 33, an iodine number of 10 and a Mooney viscosity ML 4 at 200C of 57 in 2,000 g hexane. The hexane was removed by slowly adding the cement to boiling water. The solids were dried on the mill for 5 minutes at 135 149 C 275 3000F . The time necessary for a 1 g sample to absorb 20 cc of oxygen at 1500C was then determined.

The compound was milled into a polypropylene ethylenepropylene terpolymer blend at a concentration of 0.3 parts per hundred. Seventy five mil plaques were compression molded and buttons were punched from these plaques. The buttons were exposed to a forced air oven at 1490C 300OF and the time for three of five buttons to embrittle was noted. Addition Hours to Embrittlement None 80 Compound of Example 8 214
