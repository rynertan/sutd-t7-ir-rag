# Leak detection and apparatus.

## Abstract
Repaired fluid conveying tubes 10 are tested for leaks by isolating the repaired region 12 from the remainder of the tube and then pressurizing the isolated region with a suitable gas. The isolation is accomplished by axial compres sion of one or a pair of seals 18,19 which expand radially when subjected to axial force.
