# Hair trimming apparatus.

## Abstract
The hair trimming apparatus 10 disclosed herein is particularly adapted for trimming beards, mustaches and the like. It includes a hair clipper 11 and a one piece adjustable comb attachment 16 . The comb attachment is slidably secured to the hair clipper by rails 52, 54 or the like which surround part of the clipper, such as the side edges 32, 34 of a stationary blade 18 . The position of the comb attachment with respect to the blades is determined by placing any one of a plurality of indentations in the attachment 42 to 50 over a protruding part of the clipper, such as one or more screw heads 20, 22 which secure one or more of the blades to the clipper. The position may be easily changed by merely moving the attachment to a different indentation. In this manner, the comb attachment may be easily secured to the clipper in any one of a number of positions, without manipulating other parts of the apparatus. In addition, fins 56 on the comb attachment are recessed behind the clipper blades so that the clipper may more easily reach and trim mustache hair by cutting it in the direction of hair growth.
