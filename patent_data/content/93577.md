# Angular position sensors.

## Abstract
An angular position sensor, suitably for use in a helmet sight system, comprising a link member 3 connected by first and second 5 and 49 coupling means respectively to first and second fixing means 7 and 57, 59, 63 whereby the sensor may be attached between two bodies 1 and 61 whose relative angular position is to be sensed. The first and second coupling means respectively define axes of permit ted angular movement of the first and second fixing means with respect to the link member and are associated with angle sensing means 21, 23 and 51, 53 providing electrical outputs representative of the angular positions of the fixing means about these axes. The sensor further includes a third coupling means 29, 31, 33 or 57, 59 whereby the fixing means may be moved translationally with respect to one another without altering any of the outputs of the angle sensing means. The sensor may further include fourth coupling means 35 and associated angle sensing means 43 permitting relative angular movement of the fixing means about the axis defined by the link member and providing a corresponding electrical output.
