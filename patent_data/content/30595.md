# Correction apparatus for a cathode ray tube.

## Abstract
Correction apparatus for a cathode ray tube corrects non linearities of an electron beam in accordance with the position of the beam by analogue circuitry which computes the correction from stored digital values. In response to posi tional signals X and Y, correction waveforms are generated in analogue circuits 8H, 8V and 10. the waveforms are scaled by circuits 11 in accordance with the stored digital values and are summed in circuits 9R to 9L and applied to the windings 12R to 12L of the cathode ray tube. Preferably the apparatus is applied to the correction of misconvergence in a shadow mask colour tube.
