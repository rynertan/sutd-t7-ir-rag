# Method of making a light valve mirror array and method of producing a light valve projection system.

## Abstract
A mirror array light valve comprises a plurality of closely adjacent mirror elements 23 each supported by an indi vidual one of a plurality of post members 19p disposed in a regular array on a transparent substrate 10 . The post members 19p support the mirror elements 23 under corresponding corners thereof so that all the mirror elements are deflectable in the same direction thereby causing light reflected by the mirror elements to be directed to a single quadrant. The post members are preferably hollow straight sided cylindrical silicon dioxide structures produced by a self limiting etching process.
