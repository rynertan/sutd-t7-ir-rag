## Description
ALLOY RAYON FIBERS OF HIGH FLUID HOLDING CAPACITY, METHOD OF PRODUCING THEM AND MANUFACTURED ARTICLES COMPRISING THEM The present invention relates to alloy rayon fibers having high fluid holding capacity, to articles comprising such fibers, and to a method of preparing the fibers. Alloy rayon fibers are known and comprise a homogeneous blend of regenerated cellulose and a substance capable of increasing the fluid holding capacity of the fibers. Such fibers are to be distinguished over regenerated cellulose fibers that are merely coated with the substance. Such alloy rayon fibers are usually obtained from a uniform mixture of an aqueous alkaline cellulose xanthate solution and the alloying component. In this specification and claims fluid holding capacity refers to the total liquid taken up by a mass of such alloy fibers, including the liquid held within the interstices of a mass of the fibers and the liquid absorbed and adsorbed by the fibers. In making such high fluid holding alloy rayon fibers it is known to use various acrylic polymers as the alloying component, the acrylic polymer being incorporated into the regenerated cellulose by addition to the viscose used to form the regenerated cellulose fibers and spinning the resulting mixture in the conventional way. Representative prior patents are U.S. Patents 3,844,287 now Reissue 30,029 , 4,066,584 and 4,104,214. Such prior proposals, however, are generally characterized by undesirable losses of the acrylic polymer to and interaction of the acrylic polymer with the aqueous acidic spin bath, usually an aqueous solution of H2SQ4, and No2504, into which the mixture of the acrylic polymer and viscose are spun to form the alloy rayon fiber. Such acrylic polymers lost from the cellulosic matrix during filament formation produce flocculates and or agglomerates with spinning by product materials. In turn, these become tacky, troublesome deposits in the spin bath system. The deposits are difficult to remove from the system and special procedures are required to deal with them. In accordance with this invention it has been discovered that such problems can be minimised by using as the acrylic polymer a copolymer of a acrylic acid or methacrylic acid or a mixture of the two and b at least one comonomer selected from hydroxyalkyl C2 C6 esters of said acids and styrenic monomers. E styrenic monomer as used herein is meant styrene or any vinyl aromatic monomer having properties substantially equivalent to styrene when used as a comonomer in preparing the copolymers herein. Styrenic monomers thus include styrene and substituted styrenes such as the various alkyl or halogensubstituted styrenes including the ortho, meta and para isomers thereof, for example vinyl toluene, ethylstyrene, p chlorostyrene, 2,4 dichlorostyrene, a methyl styrene, and the like. In particular, it has been found that by using such an acrylic polymer homogeneously mixed and or uniformly dispersed in desired amounts with viscose, the resulting mixture or solution is spinnable into rayon by well known methods so as to form a highfluid holding regenerated cellulosic alloy fiber and that the spin bath used in making the alloy fiber will be devoid of or contain only minimal amounts of tacky contaminant, and that there are virtually no losses of acrylic polymer during regeneration of the viscose acrylic polymer spun from the spinning jets, and during subsequent processing of the regenerated cellulosic fibers. The monomer ratio a b in the copolymer used in accordance with this invention ranges from 95 5 to 50 50 by weight, preferably from 90 10 to 60 40. Choice of comonomer b for copolymerization with the acid monomer a , the monomer ratio a b and copolymer molecular weight will be guided by several considerations. These include the viscosity and solubility of the copolymer in aqueous solution at different pR values and polymer concentrations, copolymer stability, degree of enhancement of fluid holding capacity, avoidance of formation of sticky deposits during alloy fiber formation, and the relative costs of the monomers and copolymer manufacture. Thus, for a given molecular weight, the solubility of the copolymer will increase as the pH is raised and will decrease as the proportion of comonomer b increases.Solubility will also decrease as the carbon content of comonomer b increases. For example, in a copolymer of a given acid monomer, molecular weight and monomer ratio, hydroxypropyl methacrylate and hydroxybutyl methacrylate will provide lower solubility than will the corresponding hydroxyethyl methacrylate, and styrene will introduce even lower solubility. Such lower solubilities are desirable under the acidic conditions of the spin bath for coagulating and regenerating cellulosic fibers, in order to avoid or minimize formation of sticky deposits of copolymer not incorporated into the fiber. However, the same copolymer must be sufficiently soluble under the alkaline conditions of the viscose for good admixture with the viscose.The rayon alloy fiber chemist fully understands and appreciates the foregoing considerations and can readily vary the aforementioned parameters to optimize the benefits of the invention, in light of the inventive aspects described herein and the skill of the art. Among the specific acrylic polymers found useful in this invention are copolymers of acrylic or methacrylic acid with one or more of hydroxyethyl acrylate HEA hydroxyethyl methacrylate HEMA , hydroxypropyl acrylate HPA P and styrene. When the esterifying alcohols are isomeric mixtures, the ester groups will be a mixture of the various isomers e.g., hydroxypropyl acrylate will comprise a mixture of the 2 hydroxypropyl and 3 hydroxypropyl esters. These copolymers are usually prepared in an aqueous solution containing about 5 to 20 percent solids polymer , and may be in acid form or in partially or completely neutralized form. The copolymers may contain minor proportions e.g., up to about 25 wt. percent of other monomers, in addition to monomers a and b , provided the type and amount are such as not to detract materially from the properties required for use in this invention.Appropriate other monomers include any monomers which are monofunctional to monomers a and b and therefore will not introduce cross linking. Among acceptable other monomers are esters of acrylic and methacrylic acids, such as the C1 C18 alkyl esters thereof, vinyl esters such as vinyl acetate, and vinyl halides such as vinyl chloride, and the like. The copolymers are prepared in aqueous dispersion by conventional, free radical solution polymerization techniques to provide products having molecular weights weight average in the range of about 10,000 to about 500,000, preferably about 300,000 to about 400,000. Molecular weights substantially under 10,000 will not provide sufficient fluid holding capacity, and molecular weights over 500,000 render the copolymer solutions too viscous for efficient and economical handling and incorporation into the viscose. It has been observed that the copolymers used in this invention are initially water soluble or marginally water soluble but over a relatively short period of time became irreversibly gelatinous. This unstable condition shortens the useful life of the copolymers and as a practical matter will make their use as alloying components of rayon uneconomic. Therefore it is preferred to use copolymers which have been at least partially neutralized simultaneously with or soon after formation in solution. Not only is the tendency to gellation eliminated or minimized thereby, but the marginally water soluble copolymers are solubilized and the viscosity of the solutions is maintained in a manageable range. The copolymers should be preneutralized at least about 25 percent, i.e., at least about 25 percent of the carboxyl groups of the copolymer should be converted to water solubilizing salt form, preferably by treatment of the copolymers with an alkali metal hydroxide e.g. NaOH or KOH or ammonium hydroxide. Generally, up to about 75 percent neutralization is sufficient higher degrees of neutralization tend to unduly increase the viscosity oi the solutions. Best results have been observed for about 50 to 75 neutralization with copolymers of the preferred molecular weight range, for solutions containing 5 to 20 wt. ffi of the neutralized copolymer. Thus, the degree of neutralization will generally be in inverse proportion to molecular weight for solutions of the same polymer solids, since both properties contribute to viscosity of the copolymer solutions. The above described technique for the stabilization of such polymers by controlled neutralization is the subject of our copending European application No filed simultaneously herewith. and claiming priority from United States Serial No. 218 909 In the present invention the acrylic copolymer may be added as an aqueous dispersion to the viscose prior to spinning.The mixture is then spun into fiber form in an acid spin bath in a conventional manner as described, for example, in USPatents 4,066,584 and 4,104,214. Following spinning the fibers are recovered from the bath, washed to remove adhering acid, neutralized to convert or reconvert carboxyl groups in the copolymer to salt form, and then dried. Preferably, the alloy rayon fibers of the invention will contain about 5 to 40 , based on the weight of cellulose boc , preferably 10 to 30 , of the copolymer, and the alloy fiber will be neutralized sufficiently to provide fluid holding capacity of at least 5.5 cc gram, as measured by the Syngyna test described hereinafter . The fiber preferably is neutralized to the required extent, e.g. at least 45 , by treatment with an alkali metal hydroxide, such as NaOH, or ammonium hydroxide, with the result that substantially all or a portion of the carboxyl groups of the copolymer are converted to the corresponding salts. The fibers may also be treated in known manner to provide a lubricant finish of, for example, a water soluble polyoxyethylene sorbitan mono laurate, or similar nonionic polyoxyethylene sorbitan monoester of higher fatty acid or other nonionic material.Other types of finishes known in the art may be used. The type and amount of fiber finish and the degree of conversion of carboxyl groups to carboxyiate salt groups are selected such that the wet fibers have considerable resistance to compaction and tend to separate from each other after they have been squeezed together to express excess water under pressure and then released.Thus, when the fibers are dried they will show little tendency to adhere to neighboring fibers, and the product fibers after opening will be substantially nonbonded. Specifically, the proportion of finish and the proportion of the carboxyl groups which are in salt form as the sodium salt should be such that when a mass of the fibers is wetted with two or more times its dry weight and then dried, without tension, in air at 230C, the resulting fibers are substantially nonadherent. A desirable fiber pH measured on a 1 scurry of these lubricated fibers in deionized water is in the range of about 5.5 to 9.0, preferably about 6 to 8.5.Generally, the fibers are of about 1.5 to 6 denier and the staple fiber length is in the range of about 3 4 to 5 inches, 2 13 cms , such as about 1 1 2 inches 3.8 cms . The fiber may be crimped, as described, for instance, inNerion et al. U.S. 2,517,69i Textile Research Journal Vol. 25 pp. 137 157 and Man Made Fibers by Moncrief 6th Edition, 1975, publ. by John Wiley Sons pp. 191 193. The alloy fibers of the present invention are adapted for use in a variety of articles, such as surgical dressings, pads, and vaginal tampons, in which high fluid holding retention is an essential characteristic. In the manufacture of such articles, the alloy fibers may be used in the same manner and with the same equipment as employed with other commercial fibers, including regular rayon. They may be blended with other fibers which may or may not enhance the absorbent properties of the resulting articles. Staple fibers with which the alloy fibers of the present invention may be blended include, for example, rayon, cotton, chemically modified rayon or cotton, cellulose acetate, nylon, polyester, acrylic, polyolefin, etc. Typically, a tampon is an elongated cylindrical mass of compressed fibers, which may be supplied within a tube which serves as an applicator see U.S.Patents Nos. 2,024,218 2,587,717 3,005,456 3,051,177. The following examples are intended as further illustrations of the invention. All parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise specified. In the Examples the fluid holding capacity is measured by the following procedure The fibers are carded into web form and then separated into 2.5 gram portions each about 6 inches 15 cms long. Each sub web portion is then individually rolled in the direction of its width to provide a roll six inches long 15 cms and a string is looped about the center thereof. Each such roll is then folded on itself at the string loop and drawn into a 1 2 inch diameter 1.27 cm tube within which it is compressed by a clamp and plunger, thus forming a tampon. The resulting tampons are removed, and allowed to stand for a period of about 30 minutes during which the tampons recover to a bulk density of about 0.4 g cc . They are then evaluated for their capacity to hold water by the Syngyna Method, essentially as described by G.W.Rapp in a June 1958 publication of theDepartment of Research, Loyola University, Chicago, Illinois, titled A Comparison of the Absorptive Efficiency of the CommercialCatamenial Tampon. but modified in that the liquid supply means was a syringe pump which supplied liquid to the tampon at a fixed rate of 0.92 milliliters per minute. When the end of the test is observed, the volume of liquid delivered is divided by the known weight of the tampon and the quotient is recorded. EXAMPLES Example I Preparation of Acrylic acid hydroxyethyl methacrylate 80 20 wt. Copolymer. Into a 5 liter 3 neck round bottom flask is charged 2960 ml of deionized DI water. The water is heated with a heating mantle to 85 87 C while being stirred with a mechanical stirred. While this is being done, 416 g of acrylic acid AA and 104 g of 2 hydroxyethyi methacrylate 1fEA are charged into a oneliter graduated separatory funnel. A 1 wt. ffi aqueous solution of ammonium persulfate APS is also prepared. When the temperature of the water levels off at 85 87 C, 13 ml of the 1 wt. ffi APS solution is added to the reactor. The monomer solution and a cofeed catalyst of 52 ml of the 1 wt. APS solution are then added gradually and proportionally to the reactor over a period of about two hours. During the addition the temperature is maintained at 85 87 C and agitation is increased gradually to maintain good stirring. After the additions are completed the polymer solution is held at 85 870C for 30 minutes At the end of the 30 minute time period, an additional catalyst system consisting of 0.4 g of tertiary butyl hydroperoxide diluted in 10 ml of deionized water and 0.3 g of sodium sulfoxylate formaldehyde dissolved in 10 ml of deionized water are added. Stirring is continued for 30 minutes. A neutralizer consisting of 232 g of 50 sodium hydroxide is added.Stirring is continued for about 30 minutes. The product obtained is a clear solution with a viscosity of about 7000 cps. at 20 C 2 C Brookfield Viscometer, 12 rpm spindle 3 and has a polymer solids content of 15.4 with about 50 of the acid groups neutralized.Example II The copolymer solution in water, prepared as described in Example I, a viscous liquid, containing about 15 of the copolymer of acrylic acid and hydroxyethyl methacrylate HEMA , was injected into viscose so that the resulting solutions of viscose and copolymer at the spinning jet contained 15, 20 and 25 percent of copolymer calculated as fully neutral salt , based on cellulose boc in the viscose. luring blending, the mixture is subjected to mechanical shearing. The composition of the viscose prior to blending is 9.6 percent cellulose, 6.2 percent sodium hydroxide and 31 percent based upon the weight of the cellulose carbon disulfide.The viscose ballfall viscosity is 60 and its oommon salt test is 7. The spin bath contained 7.6 percent H2SO4, 21 percent Na2SO4 and one percent Zn SO at 550cm The stretch bath contained 5 4 112504 percent E2S04 and 10 percent Na2S04 and the stretch was 70 percent. The fiber was collected, cut to about 1 1 2 inch lengths, washed successively in hot water 20 minutes, 0.5 percent NaOH 10 minutes, water 5 minutes for each of four washings, and finally washed in a solution containing 0.3 percent ABCO R 7596T solution. AHCO is a trademark of ICI America for a series of polyoxyethylene adducts of sorbitan monoesters of higher fatty acids. AHCO 7596T is the lauric acid derivative. A portion of the fiber produced from the solution containing 20 percent polymer boc was set aside in an acid form, that is, after the fibers were washed but before neutralization. This portion is identified as sample D.The fiber samples were dried, conditioned at 70 0C and 65 percent relative humidity and tested, giving results as follows Table I wherein samples II A, II B and II C are the fibers prepared from the viscose solutions containing 15, 20 and 25 percent, respectively, of the acrylic copolymer salt.

Portions of the sample except a control sample portion 1 were individually treated with dilute NaOH solution, varying the concentration to achieve different degrees of neutralization.The resulting fibers were washed, and a finish was applied as inExample II. The fibers were then dried. The control sample portion 1 acid state was similarly dried. Each sample portion was evaluated in the Syngyna test with results as shown in Table II.

It can be seen that the copolymer substantially increased the fluid holding capacity of the fibers.Example V The effect of the acidic spin bath on some of the polymers used in forming the alloy fibers of the invention was studied, as compared to polyacrylic acid as a control. In each case, the polymers were in 50 percent neutralized form sodium salts .A small pocket was fashioned by folding filter paper. One or two grams of a polymer solution was placed in the pocket and the pocket was then suspended in a synthetic spin bath, containing 7 percent H SO and 21 percent Na2SO4. After 30 minutes the pocket was removed and the contents examined and classified accordingly to appearance stringy, gel or curd and touch stickiness . Results in Table IV.
