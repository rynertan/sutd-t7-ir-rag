## Description
The present invention relates to vehicular drive control systems. Particularly, it is concerned with vehicular drive control systems capable of preventing excessive drive wheel slippage occurring when a vehicle begins moving and during acceleration to ensure stable vehicular running and improve acceleration. Heretofore, drive control systems have been known, such as those disclosed in U.S. Patents 4,416,347 and 4,484,280. In these known systems, however, in order to achieve so called traction control, a special hydraulic pump is used, independent of the vehicle brake master cylinder, to pressurize a wheel cylinder to accomplish braking. Since it is necessary to provide a separate hydraulic pump, the system structure becomes more complicated and more space is required, thus resulting in an increase in weight and manufacturing cost. Document US A 4 416 347 relates to a vehicular drive control system which comprises a brake system having a brake fluid pressurizing hydraulic pump, master cylinder means and wheel cylinder means for braking driving and non driving wheels. The system further comprises detecting means for detecting acceleration slip of the driving wheels and brake pressure adjusting means for adjusting brake pressure applied from the hydraulic pump to the wheel cylinder means and for cutting off communication between the master cylinder means and the wheel cylinder means. In this system the hydraulic pump is exclusively used for controlling the acceleration slip. It is an object of the present invention to simplify the structure of a vehicular drive control system. The technical problem is solved by an apparatus in accordance with claim 1. According to claim 1 a vehicular drive control system comprises a brake system, detecting means for detecting acceleration slip and brake pressure adjusting means. A hydraulic booster means is connected to a hydraulic pump. The brake pressure adjusting means comprises an electrically operated change over valve, pressure operated cut off valve means, electrically operated control valve means, first generating means for generating a first control signal to switch the change over valve into a hydraulic pressure passing state and second generating means for generating a second control signal to the control valve means according to the state of acceleration slip. The present invention adopts a construction including a brake system having a hydraulic booster which amplifies a vehicular brake actuating force by the use of a high hydraulic pressure supplied from a hydraulic pump. The brake system brakes vehicular wheels, including driving wheels, on the basis of hydraulic pressure provided from the hydraulic booster. A change over valve is connected to the hydraulic pump in parallel with the hydraulic booster, the change over valve changing over between cutting off and passing hydraulic pressure of the hydraulic pump. A cut off valve is disposed upstream of each brake fluid pipe leading to a wheel cylinder for braking a driving wheel in each brake system, the cut off valve cutting off the brake fluid pipe when the change over valve passes hydraulic pressure. A control valve is connected to an outlet side of the change over valve to change over between application of pressure to the wheel cylinder and discharge of pressure from the change over valve to thereby adjust the braking force to the driving wheels. Finally a control unit is responsive to detection of acceleration slip page of the driving wheels to provide a first control signal to the change over valve to switch the valve into the hydraulic pressure passing state and to provide to the control valve a second control signal according to the state of acceleration slip page of the driving wheels to thereby increase or decrease the hydraulic pressure to be supplied to the wheel cylinders of the driving wheels. According to the above construction, a change over valve is provided in parallel with a hydraulic booster in a brake system and it is brought into a state of communication with wheel cylinders upon detection of acceleration slip page of driving wheels to apply a hydraulic braking force to only the driving wheels, thereby suppressing acceleration slip page and permitting an appropriate drive control. The present invention aims at preventing acceleration slip of driving wheels by a simple construction which utilizes hydraulic pressure supplied from the hydraulic pump connected to a hydraulic booster in a typical brake system. It is an advantage of the present invention to control acceleration slip using a simplified hydraulic circuit without requiring a special hydraulic source for such control, by supplying hydraulic pressure through a change over valve from the hydraulic pump which is the pressure source of a hydraulic booster used to pressurize wheel cylinders. It is a further advantage of the present invention to permit cutoff between a master cylinder and wheel cylinders by a simplified valve structure which uses as a cut off valve a hydraulic actuated valve actuated by hydraulic pressure supplied through a change over valve, thereby attaining reduction of weight, of mounting space and of manufacturing cost. Embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail hereinunder with reference to the accompanying drawings. Referring first to FIGURE 1, there is illustrated a hydraulic circuit according to a first embodiment of the present invention which circuit performs both vehicular drive control and an anti skid control. The vehicle to be controlled is a rear wheel drive vehicle having driving rear wheels W2R and W2L and front wheels W1L and W1R. In FIGURE 1, a hydraulic booster 12 amplifies forces applied to brake pedal 10. Contiguous with hydraulic booster 12 is a master cylinder 14 which comprises first and second hydraulic pressure producing chambers 14a and 14b. First hydraulic pressure producing chamber 14a of master cylinder 14 communicates through a pipe 16 with a wheel cylinder 1R of front wheel W1R and a wheel cylinder 1L of front wheel W1L. Second hydraulic pressure producing chamber 14b of master cylinder 14 communicates with a wheel cylinder 2R of rear wheel W2R and a wheel cylinder 2L of rear wheel W2L, through a pipe 18, proportional valve 20 and cut off valves 30R, 30L. In the event the braking pressure for rear wheels W2R and W2L exceeds a predetermined value, proportional valve 20 reduces the hydraulic pressure for rear wheels W2R and W2L at a certain ratio so as to give an ideal braking force distribution relative to front wheels W1R and W1L. A motor driven hydraulic pump 42 is connected to hydraulic booster 12 through pipes 38 and 39 and a check valve 40. The suction side of hydraulic pump 42 is in communication with a reservoir 48 through a check valve 44 and pipe 46. Further, an accumulator 50 is connected to pipe 39. In the check valves 40 and 44, the direction toward hydraulic booster 12 from reservoir 48 is assumed to be the forward conducting direction. Hydraulic pump 42 also communicates with one input port of three port two position change over valve 60 through pipes 39 and 52. One of two output ports of change over valve 60 is in communication with reservoir 48, while the other output is connected to control ports of cut off valve 30R and 30L through a pipe 66R, and is further connected to rear wheel cylinders 2R and 2L through a check valve 65 and three port two position control valves 36R and 36L. The other output ports of the control valves 36R and 36L are in communication with reservoir 48. Change over valve 60 is a spring offset type three port two position solenoid valve which is switches from its position hereinafter referred to as bypassed state OFF shown in FIGURE 1 to its left hand position hereinafter referred to as communicated state ON in the same figure when energized by a control signal provided from an electronic control unit ECU 82. Cut off valves 30R and 30L are hydraulicactuated type two port two position valves which are switches from their positions hereinafter referred to as communicated state OFF shown in FIGURE 1 to their left hand positions hereinafter referred to as cut off state ON shown in the same figure when hydraulic pressure is supplied to their control ports by change over valve 60 through pipe 66R. Control valves 36R and 36L are spring offset type three port two position solenoid valves which are switched from their positions hereinafter referred to as communicated state OFF shown in FIGURE 1 to their left hand positions hereinafter referred to as bypassed state ON shown in the same figure when energized by a control signal provided from ECU 82. Non driving wheel speed sensors S1L, S1R and driving wheel speed sensors S2R, S2L, which generate pulses according to the number of revolutions of the wheels, are attached to front wheels non driving wheels W1R, W1L and rear wheels driving wheels W2R, W2L, respectively. A brake switch 84 is turned ON only when brake pedal 10 is depressed. ECU 82 includes a microcomputer as shown in FIGURE 2 having a central processing unit hereinafter referred to as CPU 62 which performs operations such as slip judgment. A counter 93 counts the number of pulses provided from speed sensors S1L, S1R, S2L and S2R. An input port 94 receives signals from speed sensors S1L, S1R, S2L, S2R and brake switch 84. A random access memory hereinafter referred to as RAM 95 stores calculation results, etc. temporarily. A read only memory hereinafter referred to as ROM 96 stores operation programs and control data. An output port 97 outputs control signals to control valves 36L and 36R and change over valve 60. More specifically, ECU 82 receives speed signals from speed sensors S1L, S1R, S2L and S2R, judges whether or not slippage is occurring according to the detected running state, and in the event of slippage, provides a control signal to change over valve 60 to operate it. At the same time, ECU 82 provides a control signal to control valves 36L and 36R according to the state of slippage and commands those valves through output port 97 to cause brake fluid pressure applied to wheel cylinders 2L and 2R of rear wheels W2L and W2R in FIGURE 1 be switched to an intensifying mode or a reducing mode to suppress slippage. The operation of this embodiment will be described below with reference to FIGURE 1. During normal kraking change over valve 60 is in the bypassed state OFF , so cut off valves 30R and 30L are in the communicated state OFF and control valves 36R and 36L are also in the communicated state OFF . When the driver depresses brake pedal 10 to stop the vehicle, the force is amplified by hydraulic booster 12 and hydraulic pressure from first hydraulic pressure producing chamber 14a of master cylinder 14 is supplied to front wheel cylinders 1R and 1L through pipe 16 to increase the internal pressure of those cylinders to thereby actuate the front brakes. Hydraulic pressure from second hydraulic pressure producing chamber 14b of master cylinder 14 is supplied to rear wheel cylinders 2R and 2L through pipe 18, proportional valve 20 and cut off valves 30R and 30L to increase the internal pressure of those cylinders to thereby actuate the rear brakes. When the hydraulic pressure in proportional valve 20 exceeds a predetermined value, there is performed a pressure reducing operation so as to attain an ideal distribution of the rear wheel braking force relative to the front wheels. Thus, in normal braking, hydraulic pump 42 supplies a hydraulic pressure to hydraulic booster 12 to increase the braking force. The following description is now provided about the operation of slip control in the event of slippage of the rear wheels driving wheels W2R and W2L in an undepressed condition of brake pedal 10 at the time of start, acceleration or turning. In the event of excessive slippage of rear wheels W2L and W2R, ECU 82 which has received signals from speed sensors S1L, S1R, S2L and S2R judges that rear wheels W2L and W2R are slipping, and controls change over valve 60 and control valves 36R and 36L to suppress slip. More specifically, ECU 82 switches change over valve 60 into the communicated state ON so that the brake fluid pressure may be applied to rear wheel cylinders 2L and 2R from hydraulic pump 42 and accumulator 50 through control valves 36R and 36L which are in the communicated state OFF . At the same time, change over valve 60 causes cut off valves 30R and 30L to assume their cut off state ON . As a result, rear wheels W2R and W2L are braked to suppress slippage. More detailed operations of slip control will be explained below with reference to the hydraulic circuit diagram of FIGURE 1 and the flowchart of FIGURE 3. Upon start of slip control processing, ECU 82 receives speed signals from speed sensors S1L, S1R, S2L and S2R. Then in step 110 a non driving wheel speed VV is calculated and in step 112 a driving wheel speed VW is calculated. Thereafter, in step 114 a judgment is made as to whether brake pedal 10 is depressed or not, on the basis of the output of brake switch 84. When brake pedal 10 is not depressed, the program advances to step 118 in which a slip judgment level VT is prepared by multiplying the non driving wheel speed corresponding to a vehicle speed by K K 1.1 2 and adding a predetermined speed VO VO 0 25 km h to the result that is, When VW is not greater than VT as determined in step 120, that is, where it is judged that there is no slip, the program advances to step 126 in which change over valve 60 is switched to the bypassed state OFF . Then, the program advances to step 128 in which control valves 36R and 36L are switched to the communicated state OFF , returning to the normal brake condition. The program returns to step 110. Where it is judged in step 114 that brake pedal 10 is depressed, the program advances to step 116 in which there is performed an anti skid control as will be described below in detail. When the internal pressures in wheel cylinders 2L and 2R are increased by the same operations as in normal braking, thereby approaching wheel lock, ECU 82, which has received signals from speed sensors S2L and S2R, judges when the wheels are in a locked condition, and switches change over valve 60 into the communicated state ON , thereby allowing hydraulic pressure from hydraulic pump 42 and accumulator 50 to be fed to cut off valves 30R and 30L and rear wheel cylinders 2L and 2R whereby cut off valves 30R and 30L are switched to the cut off state ON to cut off communication between master cylinder 14 and rear wheel cylinders 2L and 2R. At the same time, ECU 82 makes ON OFF control for control valves 36L and 36R to decrease the internal pressure of rear wheel cylinders 2L and 2R thereby suppressing the wheel slip factor to about 20 in an entirely conventional manner, well known to those skilled in the art. Anti skid control is performed in this way and then the program returns to step 110. According to the above embodiment of the present invention, hydraulic pump 42 and accumulator 50 supply hydraulic pressure to brake actuating hydraulic booster 12 and also to cut off valves 30R and 30L through change over valve 60. Cut off valves 30R and 30L operate to cut off the normal brake system, and brake fluid pressure is supplied to rear wheel cylinders 2R and 2L through change over valve 60. Since the same hydraulic pump supplies pressure for both the hydraulic booster and the slip and skid control systems, it becomes unnecessary to provide a special hydraulic pressure source for slip or anti skid control, thereby permitting simplification of the hydraulic circuit. Further, since hydraulic actuated valves, adapted to be actuated by hydraulic pressure from change over valve 60, are used as cut off valves 30R and 30L, without using such a complicated valves as a solenoid valve, it is possible to attain a more simplified valve structure. A second embodiment of the present invention will be described below with reference to FIGURE 4. The above first embodiment relates to system for controlling only rear wheels driving wheels W2L and W2R, while in this second embodiment it is made possible to effect both anti skid control for front and rear wheels W1L, W1R, W2L and W2R and acceleration slip control for rear wheels diving wheels W2L and W2R. A hydraulic circuit used in this second embodiment is as illustrated in FIGURE 4 in which there are used the same change over valve 60 and rear wheel brake system as in the first embodiment so their explanations will be omitted. In a front wheel brake system, a first hydraulic pressure producing chamber 14a of a master cylinder 14 communicates with front wheel cylinders 1R and 1L through a pipe 16 and two port tow position cut off valves 26R and 26L. A hydraulic booster 12 is connected to an input port of a three port two position change over valve 62. One of two output ports of change over valve 62 is in communication with a reservoir 48, while the other output port is connected to control ports of cut off valves 26R and 26L through a pipe 66F and also to front wheel cylinders 1R and 1L through a check valve 76, a three port two position control valve 28R and a check valve 80, and a three port two position control valve 28L, respectively. Further, change over valve 60 is provided for connection to the same rear wheel brake system as in the first embodiment. Output ports of three port two position control valves 28R and 28L are in communication with reservoir 48. The operation of this embodiment will be explained below with reference to FIGURE 4. During normal braking, change over valves 60 and 62 are in the bypassed state OFF , cut off valves 26R, 26L, 30R and 30L are in the communicated state OFF , and control valves 28R, 28L, 36R and 36L are also in the communicated state OFF . Like the first embodiment, the hydraulic pressure from master cylinder 14 is applied directly to front and rear wheel cylinders 1L, 1R, 2R and 2L. During acceleration slip control, change over valve 62 is in the bypassed state OFF , cut off valves 26R and 26L are in the communicated state OFF , and control valves 28R and 28L are also in the communicated state OFF . Like the first embodiment, change over valve 60 is switched to the communicated state ON , allowing hydraulic pressure from hydraulic pump 42 to be applied to rear wheel cylinders 2R and 2L to effect slip control for rear wheels driving wheels W2L and W2R. During anti skid control, brake pedal 10 is depressed to increase the internal pressure of wheel cylinders 1L, 1R, 2R and 2L until wheels W1L, W1R, W2L and W2R are about to be locked. As locking begins to occur, ECU 82, which has received signals from speed sensors S1L, S1R, S2L and S2R, detects the locking state and switches change over valve 62 into the communicated state ON . This allows hydraulic pressure from hydraulic booster 12 to be supplied to cut off valves 26R and 26L through change over valve 62 and pipe 66F. Also, pressure is supplied to cut off valves 30R and 30L through change over valves 62 and 60 and a pipe 66R. As a result cut off valves 26R, 26L, 30R and 30L are switched to the cut off state ON to cut off communication between master cylinder 14 and wheel cylinders 1L, 1R, 2R and 2L. At the same time, the hydraulic pressure is supplied from hydraulic booster 12 to the wheel cylinders through the change over valve 62. Thus pressure is supplied to front wheel cylinders 1R and 1L through check valve 76 and control valve 28R, and check valve 80 and control valve 28L, respectively, and is also supplied to rear wheel cylinders 2R and 2L through change over valves 62 and 60, check valve 65 and control valves 36R and 36L. Thus, with hydraulic pressure from hydraulic booster 12 applied directly to wheel cylinders 1L, 1R, 2R and 2L, ECU 82 prevents skidding bytuming control valves 28R, 28L, 36R and 36L on and off to decrease the internal pressure of wheel cylinders 1L, 1R, 2R and 2L thereby suppressing the slip factor of wheels W1R, W1L, W2R and W2L to about 20 in an enterely conventional manner, well known to those skilled in the art. According to the second embodiment of the present invention described above, the hydraulic brake circuit has an anti skid controlling function and it is provided with change over valve 62 connected to hydraulic booster 12 as well as cut off valves 26R, 26L, 30L. Also, control valves 28R, 28L, 36R and 36L are disposed between master cylinder 14 and the wheel cylinders. With this arrangement, it becomes possible to effect acceleration slip control by supplying hydraulic pressure from the hydraulic pressure source of hydraulic booster 12, namely, hydraulic pump 42 and accumulator 50, to rear wheel cylinders 2R and 2L through change over valve 60. Thus, even without providing a special hydraulic pressure source, cut off valve and control valve for acceleration slip control, it becomes possible to effect acceleration slip control by utilizing the valves for anti skid control. Consequently, it is possible to attain a more simplified hydraulic circuit. A third embodiment of the present invention will be described below with reference to FIGURES 5 and 6. Referring to FIGURE 5, there is illustrated a system using a hydraulic control valve acting as a proportional valve having a cut off valve function. A hydraulic booster 12 amplifies the force provided from brake pedal 10. Contiguous to hydraulic booster 12 is a master cylinder 14 which comprises first and second hydraulic pressure producing chambers 14a and 16b. First hydraulic pressure producing chamber 14a communicates through a pipe 16 to a wheel cylinder 1L of a left front wheel W1L and a wheel cylinder 1R of a right front wheel W1R. Second hydraulic pressure producing chamber 14b branches from a pipe 18 into two pipes, which are connected to input ports 215 of a hydraulic control valve 200 and then communicate through output ports 216 with a wheel cylinder 2L of a left rear wheel W2L and a wheel cylinder 2R of a right rear wheel W2R, respectively. Thus, the front cylinders and rear cylinders are controlled separately. Further, a motor driven hydraulic pump 42 is connected to hydraulic booster 12 through a pipe 38 and a check valve 40. The suction side of hydraulic pump 42 is connected to a reservoir 48 through a check valve 44 and a pipe 46. In check valves 44 and 40, the direction toward hydraulic booster 12 from the reservoir is assumed to be a forward conducting direction. An accumulator 50 is connected to an intermediate point of pipe 39 which constitutes an auxiliary pressure source conjointly with hydraulic pump 42. Hydraulic pump 42 is connected to one input port of a change over valve 60 through pipes 39 and 52. One output port of change over valve 60 is in communication with reservoir 48, while the other output port of change over valve 60 is connected to a control port 219 of hydraulic control valve 200, The other output port is also connected to a check valve 65. Then the piping branches into two, one communicating with wheel cylinder 2L of the left rear wheel W2L through a three port two position control valve 36L, and the other communicating with wheel cylinder 2R of right rear wheel W2R through a three port two position control valve 36R. The other output ports of the three port two position control valves hereinafter referred to as 3 2 control valve 36L and 36R are in communication with reservoir 48. In check valve 65, the direction toward the rear wheel cylinders is assumed to be a forward conducting direction. Change over valve 60 is a spring offset type three port two position solenoid valve which is switched from its position hereinafter referred to as bypassed state shown in FIGURE 5 to its left hand position hereinafter referred to as communicated state shown in the same figure when an exciting current is fed to the solenoid of valve 60. 3 2 control valves 36L and 36R are spring offset type three port two position solenoid valves which are switched from their communicated state shown in F16URE. 5 to their bypassed state when energized. Non driving wheel speed sensors S1L and S1R and driving wheel speed sensors S2L and S2R, which produce pulses according to the number of revolutions of wheels, are attached to the front wheels non driving wheels and rear wheels driving wheels , respectively. Attached to brake pedal 10 is a brake switch 84 which is turned ON only when brake pedal 10 is depressed. Outputs of these sensors and switch are fed as inputs to an electronic control unit 82. ECU 82 calculates wheel speed, slip factor, acceleration or deceleration on the basis of those inputs and then provides control signals to change over valve 60 and 3 2 control valves, 36L and 36R to change over their positions. The hydraulic circuit constructed as above operates as follows. Change over valve 60 and 3 2 control valves 36L and 36R are in the bypassed state and the communicated state, respectively, as shown in FIGURE 5. As the driver begins to depress brake pedal 12 to stop the vehicle, hydraulic brake pressure from first hydraulic pressure producing chamber 14a of master cylinder 14 is applied to wheel cylinders 1L and 1R through pipe 16 to brake left front wheel W1L and right front wheel W1R. Brake fluid pressure from second hydraulic pressure producing chamber 14b passes through pipe 18 and branches to two systems of pipes, through which it is fed to wheel cylinders 2L and 2R to brake the left rear wheel W2L and right rear wheel W2R. At this time, since hydraulic control valve 200 acting as a proportional valve is provided in pipe 18 which provides a communication between master cylinder 14 and rear wheel cylinders 2L and 2R, braking is adjusted so that the braking force for rear wheels W2L and W2R is reduced to a certain ratio of the front wheel braking force to approach an ideal distribution relative to the front wheels W1L and W1R. There is no flow of brake fluid between the front wheel braking pipe system and the rear wheel braking pipe 8system, so the independence of brake fluid pressure is maintained for each of the two system. The following description is now provided about the operation of slip control in the event that driving wheels W2L and W2R slip while brake pedal 10 is not depressed such as when the vehicle is starting and driving acceleration or turning. When ECU 82, which has received rotational speed signals from wheel speed sensors S1L, S1R, S2L and S2R, judges that the rear wheels are slipping on the basis of a difference in the number of revolutions between the front and rear wheels, it provides a control signal to change over valve 60 to switch the latter into the communicated state. As a result, a high hydraulic pressure from accumulator 50 passes through pipes 39 and 52 and change over valve 60, then branches into two from the outlet pipe of the valve, one of which is fed to control port 219 of hydraulic control valve 200. At this time, hydraulic control valve 200 acts as a cut off valve to independently cut off two systems of inlet pipes, namely, the brake systems of master cylinder 14 with each of the two rear wheel driving wheel cylinders 2L and 2R. At the same time, the pipe branched from the outlet pipe of change over valve 60 is connected to check valve 65 and branches into two, which are fed through 3 2 control valves 36L and 36R in the communicated state to rear wheel cylinders 2L and 2R. In this case, in order to provide a pressure suitable for slipping condition, ECU 82 switches change over valve 60 and 3 2 control valves 36L, 36R into the communicated state or bypassed state to switch the brake fluid pressure in rear wheel cylinders 2L and 2R into an intensifying or reducing mode while preventing interference of left and right rear wheels W2L and W2R in the same manner as in the previous embodiments. As a result, rear wheels driving wheels W2L and W2R are braked with slip suppressed, and thus a so called traction control is performed. In the above vehicular drive control system, hydraulic control valve 200 has both the function of a proportional valve and that of a cut off valve for separation of pressure systems required in acceleration slip control, so it becomes possible to dispense with special cut off valves used in the first and second embodiments. Hydraulic control valve 200 is of the structure shown in FIGRE 6. In FIGURE 6, two cylinders 202 are formed in the interior of a valve body, and a partition wall 203 is fitted and fixed to each cylinder 202 to separate each cylinder interior into a first chamber 204 and a second chamber 205. In each partition wall 203 is formed a fitting hole 206, in which a piston 207, is slidably insorted. Each piston 207 is formed with 1 a projection 208 at an end portion thereof on the side of first chamber 204, and 2 a spring 210 disposed between projection 208 and a stopper 209 mounted on the partition wall 203. Each spring 210 is mounted so as to urge piston 207 in the direction of arrow a . At a still further end beyond projection 208 of each piston 207 there are formed each annular groove 211 and a head portion 212 so as to operate as a pressure reducing piston. Around each annular groove 211 is disposed a valve seat movably within each cylinder 202 with a passage 214 between it and annular groove 211. Further, in each first chamber 204 there are formed an input port 215 as a first port communicating with hydraulic pressure produce chamber 14b and an output port 216 as a second port communicating with a wheel cylinder 2L or 2R. At the other end of each piston 207, on the side of second chamber 205, there is formed a bottom portion 218 with a seal member 217 attached thereto, the bottom portion 218 being fitted in cylinder 202. Each piston 207 acts as a pressure reducing piston and a control piston integral therewith. In one of second chambers 205, a control port 219 is formed as a third port communicating with change over valve 60. A cap 220 seals an end portion of each cylinder 202, and numerals 221 and 222 denote seal members provided in each partition wall 203. Thus two hydraulic control valves are provided in parallel in an integral structure in which the two second chambers 205 are interconnected through a communication hole 223 and there are provided two pairs of input ports 215 and output ports 216, with control port 219 being used in common. The following description is now provided about the operation of the above construction. When hydraulic pressure having a valve below a predetermined value L is applied to input port 215 from master cylinder 14, corresponding piston 207 is pushed in the direction of arrow a by spring 210 and passage 214 is formed between valve seat 213 and annular groove 211. Consequently, input port 215 and output port 216 communicate through first chamber 204 and passage 214, so that hydraulic pressure on the side of input port 215 and that on the side of output port 216 become equal. When a hydraulic pressure higher than the predetermined level L is applied to input port 215, the force in the direction of arrow b induced by hydraulic pressure from output port 216 exerted on the sectional area of piston 207 becomes larger than the force which urges piston 207 in the direction of arrow a , so that piston 207 slightly moves in the direction of arrow b and head portion 212 comes into contact with valve seat 213. If the hydraulic pressure on the side of input 215 further increases slightly, piston 207 is moved in the direction of arrow a to open passage 214, and after increasing the hydraulic pressure on the side of output port 216, passage 214 is closed. Thus, where the hydraulic pressure on the side of input port 215 is above the predetermined level L, piston 207 oscillates finely and repeats its contact and separation with respect to valve seat 213, so that the pressure on the side of output port 216 follows as a certain ratio of the pressure at input port 215. Thus, at a hydraulic pressure below the predetermined valve L, hydraulic pressure at input port 215 is directly transmitted to output port 216, while when the hydraulic pressure applied to input port 215 is above the predetermined level L, hydraulic pressure which has been reduced at a certain ratio is transmitted to output port 216. When hydraulic pressure from charge over valve 60 is applied through control port 219 into second chambers 205, a force is created which urges bottom portions 218 of both pistons 207 toward the arrow b , whereby pistons 207 are moved against the biasing force of springs 210 and the force induced by the hydraulic pressure acting in the arrow a direction. As a result, head portions 212 of pistons 207 come into contact with valve seats 213 to close passages 214 whereby communication between input ports 215 and output ports 216 is cut off completely. As described above, the valve body serves as an ordinary proportional valve, and it also serves as a cut off valve for completely cutting off communication between input ports 215 and output ports 216 when hydraulic pressure is supplied to control port 219. At this time, hydraulic pressure supplied to control port 219 acts on the two second chambers 205 through communication hole 223 and causes the two pistons 207 to move simultaneously in the direction of arrow b , thus permitting a complete and simultaneous cut off of the communication between input ports 215 and output ports 216 of each hydraulic control valve.
