# HYDRAULIC PILOTING DEVICE FOR REMOTE CONTROL

## Abstract
For special employ in hydraulic contrivances such as distributors, driving cylinders and for the hydraulic regula tion of pumps and motors with changing capacity, the device permits an exact proportionality between shifting of the control lever and the pressure wanted by the users. In stationary position of the lever, the delivery ducts to the users are connected with a drain duct by means of an insertion fitted in the device body. The lever fulcrum is fitted on a head lever bearer supported on a wrist joint. By shifting the lever, a pusher is driven which presses a supporting spring giving rise to a displacement downwards of a small rod. In this way, through an annular chamber, the feeding pressure is set into communication with a bore leading to one of the users. This is possible because the annular chamber is communicating through a radial bore with two axial bores leading to another annular chamber and allows in this way to get a pressure in the use zone lower than the feeding one and proportional to the span opened by the small rod. To the span reduction a spring is opposing, the shiffness of which is proportional to the lever displacement which is acting on the pusher. In the device, similar operation departments with rod are foreseen proportionally to the number of the use ducts which can be acted on by changing the lever movement.
