## Description
TELECOMMUNICATION SYSTEM This invention relates to automatic telecommunication systems which include digital exchanges and a digital network, e.g. of the ISDN Integrated Services Ditigal Network type. The present telephone switching network in theUnited Kingdom is predominantly analogue in nature, the analogue exchanges including a range of types of exchange from the old Strowger exchanges to relatively modem processor controlled exchanges such as TXE4 and TXE4A. The network is currently being enhanced by the provision of digital exchanges such as System X exchanges, with digital inter exchange links also being provided. Since much of the existing network and its exchanges is relatively modern the two network types, analogue and digital, must exist together for many years. This creates a number of problems relating to interworking, and an object of this invention is to facilitate the overcoming of some of these problems. According to the invention, there is provided an automatic telecommunication system, which includes an analogue exchange in the public switched telephone network and one or more digital exchanges in the public switched telephone network, and a digital PABX connected to an exchange in the public network in replacement of an analogue PABX formerly connected to the said analogue public exchange, wherein the digitalPABX is allotted one or more new directory numbers DN s for calls incoming to the digital PABX which use digital facilities, wherein the new digitalPABX also has access to the analogue public exchange to which the original analogue PABX was connected, wherein a signalling link is provided between the digital PABX and said original analogue public exchange via which cosperation of the analogue and digital parts of the system are facilitated, wherein non digital incoming calls to the digital PABX are set up from the analogue public exchanges via suitable conversion means to the digital PABX, wherein a signalling connection is provided between the analogue public exchange and the digital PABX, and wherein all calls set up from the digital PABX are routed via the digital public exchange. Embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to Figs. 1, 2 and 3 of the accompanying drawing, which are highly simplified schematic diagrams. Of these drawings, Fig. 1 is not strictly relevant to the present invention, but it is included, with the description thereof, as background to Figs. 2 and 3 which are relevant to the present invention. A technique which can be used in systems such as the present is the provision of system independent concentrator expander units, which provide digital access in local exchange areas, the concentrators being remote from the parent exchange. This is by contrast with the more conventional use of concentrators, where the concentrator is in effect a switching stage or stages forming part of an exchange from the systems aspect but located outside that exchange. Concentrator expander units as used in the systems described herein are as shown in Fig.1.Here we have a number n of multi line IDA Integrated Digital Access links 1 which extend to distant digital PAB Cs, lSPB cs Integrated ServicesPBX s , and multiplexers for digital access to a group of discrete digital subscribers. Remote digital subscriber line multiplexers, e.g.to give access to digital PABX s, may be provided at the location of the concentrator or remote from the concentrator, as can be seen from Fig. t. Such multiplexers concentrate up to fifteen digital subscribers channels and signals onto a 2.048 Mbis duplex link to from the concentrator. The signaling is statistically concentrated onto channel 16. Each subscriber has access to two 64 Kbxs channels, plus the use of channel 16 for the transfer of usernetwork signalling. These links 1 are coupled via a concentrator 2 to a number m, where mn , of digital links 3 to an expander 4 associated with a parent ISDN exchange 5. This expander expands from the links 3 to a set of links 6 into the ISDN exchange, which links are equal in number to, and respectively correspond to, the links 1. Such a concentrator expander arrangement is also known as a pair gain system since it reduces the number of circuit pairs needed for digital access from a local area to a parent digital exchange, which in theBritish network would most likely be a System X exchange. The link indicated at 7 represents a direct integrated digital access, 2 Mbisec., via digital line sections where this is justified economically.The parent 1SDN exchange 5 also has a connection 8 to the expander 4 to provide maintenancelmanagement access via subscribers lines to the expander, and thus via the housekeeping signalling links to the concentrator control. In such a system, the expander s function for several concentrators may use the same physical hardware and be controlled by the same expander microprocessor in most cases replicated in the interest of system security . Such a control inter face to the expander s maintenance management port which can be connected across the network to a centralised maintenance management function serves to communicate inband by a modem. Routing and source information as to which line on which concentrator is involved in a call is forwarded over the path connected by the set up of a call to from the centralised facility. Such information is distributed to accepted from the appropriate housekeeping signalling line to from the concentrator concerned. When such a technique is used, it is currently assumed that where an analogue PABX parented on an analogue exchange is replaced by a digitalPABX, and where digital access to that PABX e.g.from a digital public exchange is needed, then a number change is needed. This is, of course, somewhat unpopular with customers, so some amelioration of this difficulty is needed. In the systems to be described herein, the digital PABX is allowed to retain an existing network number or set of numbers, the number s appropriate to the replaced analogue exchange when the latter was associated with the public network. In addition, the digital PABX is assigned a new network number or set of numbers associated with its new parent digital e.g. lSDN exchange.The problems which arise due to number change when going over to digital access are solved by the provision of a separate incoming route from the old exchange, i.e. the analogue exchange in the public network to which the original analogue PABX was connected. This assumes that the digital public exchange and the network associated therewith is an overlay on the existing analogue network. This facility of digital access with the retention of an existing directory number DN or DN s, in addition to a new DN or set of DN s, is a facility which is needed whether or not the pair gain technique is used. We now consider Fig. 2, which shows how the double numbering approach is implemented in a system using pair gain. The reference numerals used in Fig. 1 reappear in Fig. 2 with the same significances. In Fig. 2, we see the local analogue exchange 10, which was shown in Fig. 1 at Site A, but not referred to therein. Here the ISDN exchange 5 in addition to being connected to the expander 4 via links 6, is connected via a connection 11 to a mixing multiplexer 12 at the analogue exchange 10.Another connection 15 to the mixing multiplexer 12 is a multi line integrated digital access to a digitalPABX, with traffic mixing at the multiplexer 12 which provides a number of circuits connected to the analogue exchange. The connection 11 and 15 uses 2Mb sec. DASS 2 signalling, using channel 16 of the multiplex frame. Connection 8 in this case also connects a subscriber line on the ISDN ex change to a maintenance management port on the expander. The local analogue exchange 10 also has another multiplexer 13 via which it has access over connection 14 to the concentrator 2 this is a 2 Mb sec. link, with time asigned channel 16 signal ling. The links 15 and 1 provide 2 Mb sec. DASS 2 signalling using channel 16 to the digital PABX s. In other implementations a signalling protocol according to the CCITT I Series recommendations for user network signalling is used over the channel 16 of links 15 and 1 to the digital PABX, and over the channel 16 of links 6 and 11 to the ISDN public exchange. Although the number of physical channels needed to convey the traffic between the concentrator and the expander is reduced by the use of concentration, the signalling channels are not so concentrated. Although this reduces somewhat the beneficial economies due to the use of pair gain, this is more than complemented for by reductions in development effort, complexity, and signalling delay. When concentration is used, it is necessary that under overload conditions, new calls will have to be rejected, which in principle can be done either at the concentrator or at the expander. In the present system it is done at the concentrator, so that DASS 2 LAP s Link Access Protocols are considered to terminate at the concentrator in all cases. This allows level 3 messages, as defined by the ISO reference model for open systems architecture, associated with calls to be accepted by the concentrator and transferrred via the matchingLAP. In this reference model, level 3 relates to socalled network to network communications. Thus a message for a call from the exchange over oneLAP is relayed over the matching LAP to the destination PABX if it relates to a call to which a traffic channel has been assigned, or if it relates to a new call when a free traffic channel is available. If a call request finds no free traffic channel between the concentrator and the expander, that call is not proceeded with, the message is not sent on, and a clearance message is sent in the reverse direction.This is effected at the concentrator. With the pair gain system described above, for n PCM traffic channels, the concentrator has to terminate 2n 2 signalling channels 64 Kb sec.each . This assumes that a duplicated pair of signalling channels is used for housekeeping messages between the concentrator and the expander. A simple arrangement for providing the signalling channels will now be discussed, it being assumed as an example that eight PABX exchange digital links 1, Fig. 1, are concentrated on to two links 3, and that channel 16 on each line 3 is used for signalling. It is also assumed that a Channel 1, system 1 between concentra tor and expander is used for the 64 Kb sec. channel between PABX1 and the digital pub lic exchange. b Channel 1, system 2 for PABX 2. c Channel 2, system 1 for PABX 3. d Channel 2, system 2 for PABX 4 and so on. Plugging in the DLT Digital Line Ter mination at the concentrator causes the above indicated assignment of traffic chan nels for use as signalling channels. The general principles on which this system are based are illustrated by Fig. 2, already referred to. As already indicated, calls received via the interface to the adjacent analogue local exchange 10, e.g. TXE4A, have to be mixed with calls from the parent ISDN exchange 5, e.g. System X. Originating calls from the PABX are always routed, if a channel is available, between the concentrator 2 and the expander 4 to the parent ISDN exchange 5. In the simpler case referred to above with respect to Fig. 1, the channel used for a call between the PABX and the ISDN exchange was always the same between the PABX and the concentrator as between the expander and the 1SDN exchange. Since calls from the analogue public exchange 10 and calls from the digital exchange 5 are mixed at the concentrator 2, this is no longer possible. A terminating call from the digital exchange 5 will often find that the channel chosen by that digital exchange is already in use between the concentrator 2 and the appropriate PABX for a terminating calls, e.g. from the analogue exchange 10. Hence a free channel has to be chosen for the terminating ISDN call between concentrator andPABX.Since the DASS 2 LAP s are directly associated with the traffic channels, the matching ofLAP s concentrator to PABX, and concentrator to exchange is changed by the concentrator when it receives the first call set up message. Since LAP s are matched at the concentrator, the system operates according to the principles set out earlier for PABX s which do not have to terminate PSTN calls with the old DN, and according to those just described for those which do, all in the same concentrator. The operational mode needed is determined by which sort of digital LTC LineTermination Card is used in the concentrator 2 to serve the multi line IDA interface to the appropriate digital PABX. At this point we refer to Fig. 3, which shows part of the arrangement of Fig. 2 as modified by the provision of two different types of LTC to discriminate between a digital PABX with both old and new DN s and a standard possible new PABX with new DN s only. Here the LTC, where it is desirable for the multi line IDA interface to be used to terminate calls routed to the digital PABX via the PSTN as well as those routed to from theISDN has an additional 2.048 Mbis duplex port 20.This carries a signalling channel 16 over which the assigned signalling is used for signalling between the concentrator 2 and the multiplexer not shown in Fig. 3 associated with the analogue exchange.The concentrator does a DASS 2 Channel 16 time assigment signalling conversion on incoming calls from the analogue exchange 10 for PABX s. If the latter described technique is not used, the control means of the expander could be the master, in which case LAP s terminate at the expander. The fixed algorithm for assigning signal channels avoids the need for coupler operating procedures. In both such cases a port is provided on the expander control to give an output for fault, status, etc. information to a local exchange. Such a port receivesisends messages across the network to a maintenance point. Recently British Telecom have introduced into the DASS 2 specification the use of a single multiline IDA for both public network access and for tie lines. The concentrator must know at any instant which channels are permanently assigned to these tie lines, which are private circuits. This factor can readily be taken into account by the concentrator control. Referring again to Fig. 2, we see a multiplexer 12 connected to a an analogue exchange 10 via subscriber circuits, or subscriber and junction circuits, for direct dialling in DDI , b the digital PABX concerned via a 2 Mb sec. line 15 with DASS 2 signalling over channel 16, c the parent digital exchange 5 via a 2 Mbísec. link 11, again with DASS 2 signal ling via channel 16. All traffic channel LAP s terminate in the multiplexer 12, and traffic to the PABX from the analogue exchange and from the parent digital exchange is mixed, as described above for the concentrator. However, in this case there is no concentration needed for pair gain purposes, between the sites of the analogue and the ISDN exchanges for the ISDN traffic routed via that multiplexer. The switching of a channel from the PABX link to the exchange link is still needed, but in this case control is integrated into the multiplexer, as is the signalling conversion on incoming calls from the analogue exchange 10 to the digital PABX. Switching between channels in the multiplexer 12 is simpler than that referred to above since it is in essence mainly of a time slot interchange nature. Since we are accepting calls from n analogue links and calls from up to 30 channels from to the ISDN exchange over the multi line IDA interface between the multiplexer and the ISDN exchange, and serving both via the IDA interface between multiplexer and digital PABX, some slight concentration, which could cause some call rejection, may occur. In some cases higher order multiplexing may be used to reduce the cost of digital transmission between the analogue exchange and a distant parent ISDN exchange.
