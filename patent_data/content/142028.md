# Reversible phase change composition for storing thermal energy.

## Abstract
A reversible liquid solid phase change composition for storing thermal energy. The composition comprises at least one hydrated inorganic salt selected from a salt or mixture of salts that are subject to segregation of its chemical compo nents during repeated freezing and thawing cycles, and a surface active thickening agent in the form of a cationic surfac tant and selected from an amine, salts of the amine, or a quaternary ammonium salt ofthe amine, wherein the thicken ing agent is present in the hydrated salt in an amount suffi cient to form a micelle structure throughout the hydrated salt to prevent such segregation.
