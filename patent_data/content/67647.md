# Cationic polymer flocculant.

## Abstract
Known cationic polymer flocculants tend to break down, particular in aqueous solutions at high temperatures and low concentrations. This problem is now overcome by use of a polycondensate of i an epihalohydrin, ii a reaction product of a monohydric phenol with formaldehyde and a dialkyla mine of two to six carbon atoms and iii a reaction product of a bisphenol with formaldehyde and a dialkylamine of two to six carbon atoms, the molar ratio of ii iii being from 90 10 to 50 50. These polycondensates can be used to flocculate flocculatable substances in industrial effluents.
