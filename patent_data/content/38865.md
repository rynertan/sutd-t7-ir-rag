## Description
This apparatus is directed to an electron beam accessed random access memory which is capable of reading, writing and erasing information stored in a binary state. One such device is described by literature of the General Electric Company. Another such device is described in Applied Physics Letters, Volume 1G,No. 147, 1970 by Hunert et al. In these, the electron beam subjects the metal oxide semiconductor MOS memory dielectric layer to an excessive fluence of electrons over a period of time, damaging the dielectric layer and destroying the ability of the MOS memory target to both store and read stored information.Depending on the electron beam current and the repetition of read and write cyc es, the integral of the electron beam fluence ultimately produces ionizing radiation and physical damage which prohibits further reading, writing and erasing. Thus, the memory target life cycle of both prior art devices is severely limited. The lifetime of data stored is limited in that charges also accumulate during reading so that after a few readings, data is no longer distinguishable and must be erased and written again. Such devices are limited in the number of bit storage density. Relatively thick layers of the MOS target must be penetrated by high energy electrons and scattering of the beam occurs.Furthermore, the source of electrons in the prior art devices are similar to Cathode Ray Tubes CRT and have their size, power supplies, focus and beam deflection systems. The devices of the prior art customarily use a junction diode as the output device and not a Schottky diode which has at least twice the gain. Furthermore, the prior art dev ices do not allow selective erase or overwrite of stored data of both polarities, and they must totally erase an entire storage array while this invention allows selective overwrite or erase at a normal reading cycle.Thus, the beam accessed storage devices of the prior art are capable of only a few reading and writing cycles, have shorter storage life, have less than optimum storage density, cannot selectively overwrite or erase data stored both polarities, are of large physical size, reauire higher power for operation, produce only a single bit per random access and require multiples for parallel bit access, and cannot be manufactured by economic semiconouctor type batch processes. The present invention is an electron beam accessed random access memory. Data storage sites are delineated only by repeatable X Y beam positions. The present invention is comprised of an array of field emission microcathodes each having focusing and deflection electrodes, and an array of memory target areas. The memory target is comprised of five layers the top is a thin layer of metal conductor and the second is a semiconductor which together form a Schottky diode the third is a thin layer of dielectric, the fourth is a thicker dielectric layer, and the fifth layer is a thicker metal layer, which is the gate terminal of the target. N by N storage areas in Nl by M targets may be read at the same time, allowing fast parallel reading and writing. Erasing of data is accomplished by overwriting individual storage areas, or in bulk by application of a significiantly higher potential to the storage area gate. The thin dielectric layer is sufficiently thick to prevent data loss from the thicker dielectric layer by thermal tunneling of captured charges. The reading electron beam current is insufficient to create the field necessary for tunneling of charges through the thin dielectric and data life is therefore long. Fig. 1 is a cross sectional view of the field emission cold cathode, the X Y defection plates, and the targct, all of which are in รง sealed container Fig. 2 is a sectional view through the target of the present invention showing the various layers which comprise the target Fig. 3 is a schematic diagram of an amplifier for obtaining an output signal from the target Fig. 4 is a timing chart showing output signals relative to the signals applied to the X Y deflection system Fig. 5 is a timing chart shoving the relative voltages for the read and write modes of operation and also showing how data is input to the device Figs. 6, 7, 6 and 9 are steps in the one manufacturing process of a combined solid state focusing lense and deflection plate system for directing the electron beam toward a specified location and Figs. 10, 11 and 12 are steps in one manufacturing process of a target for beam storage and reading of data.he Assembly As a hole The electron beam accessed memory 10 is formed of three major assemblies. The first is a field emission cold cathode 12.The second assembly 14 is a set of deflection plates and focusing lense. The third assembly is a semiconductor target 16. A beam of electrons isemitted by the cathode assembly 12 with one amplitude if digital data is to be read and a larger amplitude to write. The beam is shped at an aperture, and the deflection plates 14 direct the beam to a certain bit in the target to store the data and provides output signals when read. The target 16 is divided into individual bit storage areas which have a typical dimension of about 0.15 microns diameter. The target area is a square of N by N dimensions where N is a whole number integer and typically a power of 2. The target is a layered device which forms a chargc trap between specified layers.When a specific charge is present, a binary one is written into memory. When the charge is absent or of opposite polarity, a binary zero is written. The charge can be read by scanning with a read beam which forms a binary output current flow through a Schottky diode. The beam formed by the cathode circuit 12 is focused on a particular point an X Y address to relate the output signal to the address. The apparatus is enclosed in a hermetically sealed container 18. Going now to the emitter for the electron beam, it is preferably constructec in the manner described in the works of Charles A. Spindt in an article found in t he Journal of Applic tJ Physics, v. 39, No. 7, June 1968, pp. 3504 3505, A Thin Film Field Emission Cathode , and is also described in his patent 3,789,471, and other patents in his name. As described in the patents of Spinet, a substrate 19 is formed of a suitable metal or non metal. if metal, one suitable cnoice is a sheet of molybdenum. Alternately, a plate of aluminum oxide coated with a film of molybdenum may be used.It is preferably conductive or at least semiconductive. The numeral 20 identifies an exposed radiation point. It is preferably conical or pyramidal in shape with a pyramid height of about 0.6 mil. The pyramid is formed of i nsulating material or of composite materials where the surface is coated or otherwise treated to obtain the desired emission characteristics. An insulated spacer 21 on the substrate 19 supports a screcn 22 With an aperture 23 centers around the point of the exposed electrode 20. The layer 21 is an insulator between the substrates 1S and 22. The substrate 22 is charged positively with respect to the electrode 20 by a voltage across the substrates 19 end 2 to produce 2 high electric field at the electrode point 20. Negative charge accumulates on the point and emits electrons from the point focused into a beam by t he electric field. A power supply 25 is connected between the substrates 19 and 22. The numeral 26 identifies a read write modulator.When a binary Cata is to be read, the modulator 26 provides no additional voltage to tne potential diff erence between the substrates 19 and 22. When binary data is to be written, the voltage is increased, thereby increasing the current flow in the electron beam. The writing current is about 100 times laraer than thc read current. The beam is accelerated by a additional power supply 27 between the electrode 20 and the target 16 which determines the energy and penetration of the beam. The same accelerating voltage is used for reading and writing the data stored in the target 16. rcad write modulator 28 is connected to the target 16 to modulate the data. The accelerating voltage is typically in the range of 4,000 to about 6,000 volts. For writing, the beam current is increased dependent on the dwell time, thickness, distance from the electrode 20, size of the target bit location, and other factors, The beam deflector 14 includes X and Y axis reflector plates. Plates for the.N voltage 31 and 32 are spaced at opposite sides of tile beem. The Y plates 33 and 34 are at right angles to the X plates. All are preferably formed on dielectric substrates trilled with a rclatively small hole approximately ope to five microns in diameter. Metalized, spaced, parallel electrode are used in the same fashion as in e cathode ray tube with the deflcction plates 31 34 supported on substrates with conductive pads qeorctrically arranged adjacent to the hole. The pads are electrically isolated by an intermediate dielectric substrate. z focusing aperture including a concentric conductor around the axial hole and about 10 or 15 microns in diameter is acceptable.A circular conductive ring electrified to about three to thirty volts difference to the substrate 19 directs the beam tbrough the aperture and the deflection plates. The focusing ring and deflection plates are formed in multiple layers which have a thickness depending upon the deflection and target distance. The target 16 includes multiple locations for storage of data bits. The deflection plates position the electron beam to the various locations so that reading, writing, or erasing, as necessary, may occur. The target 16 thus defines a mass memory device which is organized on a N by N pattern. A suitable spacing to the target 16 is one or two centimeters or more if the target array is 3arc er. Given maximum deflection anglc, an increase in target size more bits storage capacity requires a greater distance. Representative dimensions are up to about 512X 512 individual bit storage areas, a circular storage area about C .15 microns in oiamteter to define a rectangular target of about 75 X 75 microns.In vie w of spacing at one or two centimeters, the deflection angle is relatively small. If the target has a dimension of 512 bits, then a nine bit words, ignoring parity, will describe uniquely each particular target location. Fig. 1 incorporates a Y address register 38 to receive tnd hold a Y address of nine bits. The Y address is input to a digital to analog converter 39, to form an output voltage applic d to the plates for the Y axis, thus deflecting the beam. An inverter 40 applies the voltage from the converter t 9 to thc opposite plate. Target Description Going now to Fig. 2 of the drRwings, the target 16 is shown in cn enlarged sectional view. The target 16 is uniformly constructed across the entire area of N by N. The target 16 is positioned perpendicular to the undeflected beam. It has the N by N hit locations distinguished one from another only by physical location. They are not mechanically isolated from one another. The description proceeding from the top down relates the function of the various layers in the target 16 to the electron beam which impinges upon it. On the top, relatively thin conductor layer 50 Is preferably aluminuim about 25C angstroms thick. This layer functions as one of the terminals of a Schottky diode with the doped silicon layer therebelow. The beam penetrates the aluminum layer 50. The conductor is preferably thin and of low density to minimize scattering of the electron beam. Each bit location is about 0.15 microns in diameter. The entire alaflinum layer forms a single diode but it is beam activated only at one bit location at a time. Accordingly, it is apprcpridte to speak of a singlediode at each bit location which diode has a diameter of about 0.15 microns. The relatively thin aluminum deposition is laid over a silicon semiconductor layer 52. The layer 52 is relatively thick, in the range of 500 to 1500 angstroms thickness with N type or P type impurities. The preferred embodiment is N type. The amount of doping is about 10 to 10 per cubic centimeter.The dopant concentration is less than that which would allow tunneling across the diode depletion region, but sufficient to cause a low diffusion coefficient. It is sufficient to create the Schottky diode in conjunction with the metal deposition on the top surface The dopant selected is any of those customarily used for obtaining N or P doping. The numeral 53 identifies a dielectric insulator such as silicon nitride or aluminum oxide which borders around the target 1G. It adds a rim or border which lends mechanical strength to the structure. Moreover, it defines the outer limits of the target. It has nothing to do with the storage of data in the target. It merely indicates the limits of the target and also limits the area where the Schottky diode is constructed.its width is also immaterial and need not enter into consideration. The rietalized top layer 50 and the silicon layer 52 extend across the width and length of the target 16 to form aSchottky diode with the terminals 54 and 55. The terminals are inputs for an inverting amplifier. h suitable operating bias voltage is provided across the diode and input terminals of the amplifier. The numers fi identifies a relatively thin silicon dioxide dielectric. The layer 56 is relatively thin, typically in the measure of about 25 angstroms but it can be varied dependent on voltages. Ihe numeral 56 identifies a suitable dielectric layer preferably formed of silicon nitride or aluminum oxide, and has a thickness of about 300 to 500 A . This range of thickness defines a suitable polarizing field for charges which are held in this layer as described. The layer has low mobility of charges to isolate adjacent bit storage locations. The bottom most layer 60 is a relatively thick aluminum gate structure one micron or more thick. It is fairly thick to define a supporting base or foundation for the comparatively thin layers which are carried on it. It also serves as an electrical terminal connected to the voltage source 98 for dsta modulation and a source 27 for acceleration purposes.The accelerating potential and the read write wave form are applied to the gate 60. Consider the target 16 in three operations writing of a binary one, writing of a binary zero, and reading of the data. Preferably, the beam is accelerated to about 5000 electron volts rev with a current flow that is in the range of about one nanoampere. hen the beam enters the layer 50, a certain portion of the energy is dissipated, less than 2000 electron volts cv of energy is dissipated in that layer. This then leaves the electron beam with an energy level of about 2000 to 4000 ev to dissipate within the silicon layer. When each electron strikes the silicon layer, it ionizes a charged pair, namely an electron and 2 hole for each 3.6 ev of energy dissipated and an adequate number of charged pairs is liberated in the silicon layer 5. Prior to the introduction of the electron beam into the silicon layer 52, two fields exist. The first field extends across the depletion region of the Schottky diode into the silicon layer 52. Tne field width into the silicon layer 52 is controlled by the bias supply 29. Assuming N doped silicon, the negative terminal of supply S is connected to the diode at terminal 54, and the positive terminal of supply 29 is connected to the silicon at terminal 55.The second field exists between the surfece of the silicon 52 and its interface with dielectric layer 56. The existing surf a Ce charges resulting from unsatisfied bonds, contaminants, mechanical discontinuities, and charges ccstured near the interface between dielectric layers 56 and 58 cause surface charges of the silicon to be accumulated, and thereforc the conductivity at the surface is greater than in the bulk of silicon layer 52. In the preferred embodiment theSchottky diode field is depleted of electrons and the silicon surface near the intertace with dielectric layer 56 is accumulated with electrons. ts,hon the energy of the beam of electrons is expended in the silicon 52 and its depletion region, the charge multiplication created by the ionization proces s both produces a field in the seiniconductor tend results in a current amplification in the semiconductor, increasing the current in the semiconductor by two orders of magnitude or more over the amplitude of the electron beam currcnt The ionized charges created by the exhaustion of the electron beam energy are separated by the fields in the semiconductor.The beam ot electrons is a virtual electrode in the semiconductor have a polarity which is a function of the polarity and magnitude of the supply 28 connected between the gate 60 and semiconductor 52. The ionized pairs crested in tht Schottky diode depletion region of the semiconductor tend to be separated by that depletion region field and dritt rapidly, in a few nanoseconds or less, to the corresponding diode ohmic contacts creating particle and displacement currents which appear in the load circuit at the input to the amplifier.Charge pairs created in the semiconductor gate field, of which the energy exhausted electron beam is one terminal, in combinetion with the polarizing bias supply 29, are separated by that field and tend to recombine witn opposite polarity charges at the semiconductor dielectric interface, or, in the high field conditions of the writing mo, are accelerated by the high field and tunnel across the thin dielectric layer 56, and are captured near the interface between dielectric layers 56 and 58. Conversely, charges of opposite polarity previously cartured near that interface can be caused by the high writing field to tunnel back through to the silicon, thus overnfriting or erasing previous data. Bit Storage Density Lateral diffusion or sprcading of charges, affecting data storage density, is controlled by the thickness and conductivity of the semiconductor. High semiconductor conductivity and thin fil of the semiconductor produces low diffusion coefficient of the charges and minimal spreading, particularly in the silicon accumulation region near the semiconductor dielectric interface where conductivity is the highest.The thickness of tnz semiconductor 52 for a given semiconductor material, doping density and electron beam encrgy, is made to satisfy four criteria Firstly, that the electron beam energy is exheusted in the semiconductor before reaching the diclectric layer r4 second ly, that sufficient electron beam cnergy is exhausted in ionization of charge pairs to produce the current anplificution required for either writing or operetions, thirdly, that the semiconductor layer 52 is thin enough to create the bit area stored density desired and fourthly, that the Schottky diode depletion into the semiconductor is sufficient to withstand the field created in the semiconductor.Current amplification occurs as the energy of tne brzm is exheusted in the semiconductor. The average depth of penetration is function of the semiconductor density. For silicon semiconductors, and an energy of 4Kev, the average penetration is about 2200 ngstroms. An average of 4000 3. or 1250 charge pairs would be created per electron by io nization. Since 2200 Angstroms is the average depth, the silicon layer 52 should heve such additional thickness tc prevent electrons from reaching diclectric layer 54 to avoid ionization and consequent cumulative fixed charge creation in that cielectric. For a small diameter elcctron beam, COO Angstroms mean diameter or less, charge pair diffusion rather then beam spreading is the major factor effecting bit storage location density.The effectual diffusion ot created charges occurs outside ot the Schottky diode repletion region field within the semiconductor, between the depletion region edge and the semiconductor dielectric interface. The width of the depletion region into the semiconductor is controlled by bias source 29. That undepleted width in the semiconductor should be made less than the desired spacing between bit storage locations so that when reading stored information, the chcrgcs created in the semiconductor not recombining at the semiconductcr dielectric surface will be beerer to and more probably captured by the Schottky diode field than diffusing to anu recombining not neighboring attractive bit storage locations.Tbe width of the Schottky diode depletion region should be sufficient to support the field created in tne semiconductor by the electron bc ait, the width being adjustable by bias supply 29. In e writirg oporation, the bias voltage 28 produce e ficld which is used to polarize the field created by the electron beam. Since thc polarizing fields between gate 60 anzac semiconductor 52 covers the whole N by N area of data storage positions, only one cf which is addressed by the electron beam, for proper operation thai polarizing potential must meet sevcral criteria Firstly, the combination of the field created in thr semiconductor and the glte to scmiconductor fields, including that supplied by the polarizing potential, surface state and dielectric trapped chorges, must be sufficient to both select the polarity of and course tunneling of the charge across dielectric gg into die ectric 5 . Secondly, the field produced in the restraining N by N storage areas by the polarizing potential of supply 28 must not be sufficient to cause tunnnling of charges in those non addressed locations.The field produced by the polarizing supply 28 is a function of the potential and the thicknesses of dielectric layers 56 and 58. For example, if we assume nominal values for both previously written charges and for surf ace state charges, and 2.5 nanometers thickness for dielectric layer 56 of silicon dioxice, and 35 nanometers thickness for dielectric layer 58 of silicon nitride, then the potential applied by source 2P should not exceed 5 volts. The remaining field requires about 7.6x10 v cm or about 1.9 volts across the 9.5 nanometer thickness of dielectric 56, must be supplied by the field created in the semiconductor by the electron beam. In a rending or off condition, the gate electrode 60 is placed at the same potentiel as the semiconductor 52. when the gate electrode is made positive with respect to the semiconductor in a writing operation, electrons are caused to tunnel across dielectric 54 into dielectric 55 and combine with holes in that dielectric, or to bc captured, resulting in less surfece accumulation and bigher recombination velocity in a subsequent reading operation. when the gate electrode 60 is made negative with respect to the semiconductor potential in a writing operation, holes recombine at the surface and are caused to tunnel through dielectric 54 into dielectric 56, and be captured, or electrons caused to tunnel back through dielectric 54 producing greater surface accumulation end a lower surface recombination velocity in a subsequent reading operation. The charge near the dielectric dielectric interface prior to ny operations, and due to manufactuning processes can be varied monotonicl y increasingly positive at deposition temperatures for s ilicon nitride bvelow about 2500 C, and increasingly negative at temperatures about 850 C.Summary of Writing Oporations To write binary zero, the following conditions must occur 1. The desired single position of the N by N possible positions is input in binary form Lo the X and Y address registers 38, convented into an analog voltage for the X and Y coordinates of the address by digital to nalog converters 39, conneoted to deflection plates 31 32 and 33 34 respectively, which analog voltages cause the beam of electrons to be positioned at the selected location. 2. The read write modulator 26 must be in the write condition, supply the higher voltage as indicated in Figure 5 to the field emission cathode to produce the nigher, writing beam current and consequently sufficient field in the semiconductor to cause tunneling and capture of charges across dielectric 56 into dielectric 58. 3. In some lesions it may be necessary to change the potential supplied by 29, across the Schottky diode terminals 5,55, to effect a change in the diode depletion width into the semiconductor, which width would differ in the reading and writing oporations. In such a design, a read write signal of the same tiring but ci 2 differing sufficient amplitude and polarity would be applied as a portion of bias source 29 to effect the desired change. 4. The data modulator must be in the positive, binary cne, state of the cat wavcform, Figure 5, applying a positive voleage from gate 60 to semiconductor 52, polarizing the electron beam locally crested field in the semiconductor and causing electrons to tunnel across dielectric 9 and be captured in dielectric 58 or combine with holes in dielectric 58. When the dat voltage returns to the same potential as the semiconductor, the reading condition, and then the electron beam field is reduced to the reading levol, tht tunneled charges are frozen in, end result in less surtc ce accumulation and higher surface recombination velocity. To write a bindery one, the following conditions must occur Conditions 1, 2 and 3 are the same as for writing a binary zero. 2. The data modulator must be in the negative, binary zero, State of the data waveform, Figure 5, applying a negative voltage from the gate 60 to semiconductor , but not so negative as to produce an inversion layer in the semiconductor, said negative voltage being sufficient to polarize the electron beer created field in the semiconductor and causing holes to tunnel cross dielectric 5s, or electrons to tunnel back across dielectric 56, resulting in charges being frozen in when the gte voltage is returned to zero volts with respect to the semiconductor potential. Reading Operation Tbe same ccelerating voltage is used as in writing. The read write modulator 26 is set to read, the low voltage condition of Figure 5, reducing the electron beam current to 1 100 of the current use for writing, bout 10 picoamperes, insufficiont te cause tunneling. The beam is positioned to the desired storage location. The reading bear current is amplitied, as in the case of writing, by ionization of a multiplicity of charge pairs. The excess holes create must either recombine at the semiconductor surface near. the interface with dielectric 56, or be capturec by tic field of the Schottky diode. The insignificant number of holes recombining in the bulk silicon can be neglected The charge pairs ereated in the semiconductor near the semiconductordielectric interface are affected by the surface recombination velocity.As the surface recombination velocity increases, fewer and fewer holes are captured by the field of the diode and more ard more of the excess holes ereated by the reading beam recombine at the surface. A stored binary one corresponds to high recomtination velocity, and a stored binary zero corresponds to low, ner zero, recombination velocity. If a binary zero is read, nearly all excrss uncles will b e captured by the field or the diode and appear as cz modulation on the output current between terminals 54 nc 55. A positive voltage corresponds to a binary one, an6 3 ground potential corresponds to a binary zero.Manufacturing Prccess A scries of manufacturing steps are shown in Figs. G 9 is a method of manufacturing serveral cold emission cathodes and deflector plates. The next manufacturing process to be described is one suitable for manufacture of the target 16 having a first layer of metal, a secord layer of semiconductor, third and fourtn layers which differ in thickness and which are dielectric layers, tend a bottom lrycr which is a conductive metal substrate or gate. Connective pads around the periphery for connecting suitable bils voltages to the Sciiottky ioc and between the semiconductor and the metal substrate. through the usc of chemical or plasma discharge technigues, a wafer of suitably doped silicon is thinned to a thickness of about ten microns or less. The actual thickness is dependent on the target area width desired and whether or not subsequent edging techniques are anisotropic. Fig. 10 is representative of this and depicts silicon layer 80 with grown oxide thicknesses 26 and 88 on both surfaces. Photolithographic techniques define areas to be etched awes. Etching utilizing protoresist proceeds cnd etch pits are formed as shown in Fig.11. A membrane is formes about two microns thick in the silicon layer 84 in thz etch pi 90. Fig. 11 presupposes that an anisotropic process is used. Thereafter, through the use chemical or pl sme cleaning techniqurs, the remaining silicon dioxide layer 86 is removed and tfle water is cleaned. The next step is to grow about 25 A of clean silicon dioxide 9 2 on the weter at e relatively low temperature, typically abeut 600 C or lower. The next step is then to deposit silicon nitride D4 at e temperature of about 7000 C. rthe exact temporture, whether about or below 2 spocified temperature usually 700 C , depends on the magnitude and sign of the charges desired to be trapped or dliminated from capture near the oxide nitride interface.This layer 94 has thickness in the range of about 350 to 500 ngstroms. Ihe preferred thickness is about 450 . Contact holes are formed through the successive layers to enable connection with the str nt of the device. The semiconductor layer in the pit 0 may be chemically exposed on the lower side to permit ion implantation for the purpose of altering the resistivity of the silicon to enable ohmic contact. Thercefter, a suitable conductor 96, typically aluminum, is deposited to c tickness of 10 microns or greater. Fig. 12 shows four layers adjacent to the etch pit 90 as shown in Fig. 2 except, howecer, the connections are omitted and the top motel surface has not yet been opplied. The silicon substrate 84 is inverted and through the userof photolithographic techniques, suitable patterns are formed on the face now the top face . ihc exposed silicon is thnn etched to the final desired thickness sc that the surplus portion can be removed. Surplus provides adequete mechanical strure in the fabrication. After thc face o the wafer 84 h s been etched, then aluminum or some other low density conductor material 8 is sputtered or otherwise deposited to a thickness of about 20 to 25 nanometers normally from eboste upon inverting the silicon wafer. The five layers of the target are now delined and seribed into dice of suitable sizes. In n cast, the foreqoine is dirccted to the preferred embodimkentbut the scope thereof is determined by thc claims.
