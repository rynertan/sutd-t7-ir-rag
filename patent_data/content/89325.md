# Apparatus and method for electrolysis of MgC12.

## Abstract
An apparatus for electrolysis of MgClâ‚‚, comprising an air tightly sealed shell 2 of metallic material, said shell exhibiting in horizontal cross section a rounded profile which comprises at four portions a curve selected from a quarter circular arc and a quarter elliptical arc, a measure for forcibly cooling said shell from outside, a wall structure 3 which consists of an insulative refractory of a decreased thickness and which is provided along said shell, and electrolysis chamber 5 defined by said wall structure and a pair of primary partitions 4 extending in parallel with each other across the wall structure, a separation chamber 6 for stripping magnesium metal from eletrolytic bath provided in adjacency with the electrolysis chamber, at least one pair of anode 9 and cathode 10 arranged in the electrolysis chamber 5 , at least one bipolar intermediate electrode 11 arranged between the anode and cathode, and a top cover 14 provided air tightly over the electrolysis chamber 5 and the separation chamber 6 , thus allowing as a whole an electrolytic operation at a substantially regulated bath tem perature with in increased number or electrodes contained.
