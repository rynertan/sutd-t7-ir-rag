# COOKING VESSEL AND WHISTLING KNOB THEREFOR

## Abstract
A cooking vessel 2 is provided with a whistling knob 6 which has an internal passage 26 for carrying steam from a hole 36 in the cooking vessel to a rotary whistle chamber 28 molded to the knob. The whistle chamber is displaced from and eccentric to the knob axis. The lower surface of the knob has a cavity 38 which surrounds the knob axis, providing a steam passage inlet which is in communication with the hole in the cooking vessel regardless of the angular position of the knob relative to its axis. From the inlet cavity, steam passes through a vertically extending passage 40 , a plenum chamber 42 and a horizontally extending passage 26 which introduces steam into the whistle chamber 28 at an angle which causes an audible whistle and rotary movement of the steam. The whistle chamber 28 has an outlet 32 which may be opened and closed by rotational movement of a valve ring 14 which extends circumferentially around the knob. The body of the knob is formed of two parts 10, 12 which are separable to permit removal of the valve ring and cleaning of the internal portions of the knob. A temperature indicating device may be incorporated in the knob.
