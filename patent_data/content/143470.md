# INFORMATION RECORDING MEDIUM

## Abstract
An information recording medium 10 according to the present invention permits recording with high density, re producing, and erasing using electric charges 18 . In particular, a second insulator film 13 thereof is formed as a multi layer structure with different electric current density and charge trapping density for each layer 13a, 13b . With this recording medium, satisfactory characteristics for re cording, reproducing, and erasing can be obtained using films 13 of smaller thickness than for the case of single layer structure, making it possible to extend the life of the electrode 15 used for recording and erasing through re duction in the voltages required for recording and erasing.
