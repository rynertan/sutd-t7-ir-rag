# A method of producing a flemish eye on the end of a rope and a flemish eye device.

## Abstract
In forming flemish eyes at the ends of wire ropes to produce e.g. slings, serious difficulties arise when forming the anchorage for the spliced loops 7 if the rope 1 is of large diameter. The terminal end of the rope material has its com ponent strands naturally laid on the rope 1 , and it has been proposed to enclose the naturally laid strands in a cylindrical sleeve 2 adjacent to the loop and introduce a hardenable anchoring material 17 such as a resin into the sleeve 2 to complete the anchorage. It is now found that improved loading distribution on a wire rope 1 can be obtained through providing an anchorage for the loop 7 in the form of a sleeve 2 comprising a socket 6 , and flaring out into the socket 6 the component wires 14 of portions of the strands remote from the loop 7 , the strand portions adjacent to the loop 7 remaining naturally laid on the rope 1 .
