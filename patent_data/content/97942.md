## Description
ANTIALLERGIC PYRAZINE BIS 2 OXOGLYcINE COMPOUNDS FIELD OF INVENTION The invention is a group of compounds which inhibit release of mediators, such as histamine, which play a key role in allergic responses. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The role of antigen antibody reactions in effecting release of mediators from mast cells is discussed in U.S.P. 4,191,840 which is directed to a group of anti allergic benzene oxamic acid compounds having mediator release inhibiting MRI activity. Pyridine dioxamic acid compounds useful in the treatment of allergy are disclosed in U.S.P. 3,963,660. Both types of the patented compounds are said to be orally administrable. OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION The primary object of the present invention is to provide new orally administrable antiallergy agents. Another object is to provide MRI compounds of a type other than those disclosed in the foregoing 660 and 840 patents. A further object is to provide an orally administrable MRI compound having a low ED50 and exhibiting rapid onset of activity with a high level of inhibition. A corollary object is to provide a novel process for the preparation of 2,6 pyrazinediyl dioxamic acid compounds substituted or unsubstituted in the 3 and 5positions. Additional objects will be made apparent by the following specifications and claims, to those knowledgeable in the art. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It has now been discovered that certain pyrazine oxamic acid compounds are orally administrable and have antiallergic activity. These compounds have the following formula EMI2.1 wherein X is H, Br or C1, the same in each occurrence, and R is H, C1 C4 alkyl or a pharmaceutically accep table metal or ammonium cation. Those of the preceding compounds in which X is H are preferred particularly preferred among the latter compounds is the one in which R is Na , in both occurrences. The subject compounds may be more formally named as N,N 2, 6 pyrazinediyl bis 2 oxoglycines , as such, as their salts or as their dialkyl esters. As employed herein, the term pharmaceutically acceptable metal or ammonium cation is intended to include non toxic metal cationic salts such as the alkali metal salts, e.g., sodium and potassium, alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium, magnesium or barium and salts with ammonia and amines, e.g., amines such as triethylamine, n propylamine, tri n butylamine, tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane THAM , N,N bis hydroxy ethylpiperazine, 2 amino 2 methyl l propanol, 2 amino 2 methyl 1,3 propanediol, and triethanolamine. The alkali metal salts and, particularly the sodium salt, are preferred. DETAINED m DESCRIPTION The compounds of the present invention possess antiallergic activity. Thus, they are useful in the treatment of conditions in which antigen antibody reactions are responsible for disease and particularly in the treatment of allergic diseases such as but not limited to asthma, hay fever, urticaria, eczema or atopic dermatitis and upper respiratory conditions such as allergic rhinitis. The compounds of the present invention may be administered either as individual therapeutic agents or as mixtures with other therapeutic agents. They may be administered alone but are generally administered in the form of pharmaceutical compositions, i.e., mixtures of active agents with suitable pharmaceutical carriers or diluents. Examples of such compositions include tablets, lozenges, capsules, suppositories, powders, aerosol sprays, aqueous or oily suspensions, syrups, elixirs and aqueous solutions for injection. The compounds are most preferably administered in oral dosage forms. The nature of the pharmaceutical composition and the pharmaceutical carrier or diluent will, or course, depend on the desired route of administration, i.e., orally, parenterally or by inhalation. Oral compositions may be in the form of tablets or capsules and may contain conventional excipients such as binding agents e.g., syrup, acacia, gelatin, sorbitol, tragacanth or polyvinylpyrrolidone , fillers e.g., lactose, sugar, maize starch, calcium phosphate, sorbitol or glycine , lubricants e.g., magnesium stearate, talc, polyethylene glycol, or silica , disintegrants e.g., starch or wetting agents e.g., sodium lauryl sulfate . Oral liquid preparations may be in the form of aqueous or oily suspensions, solutions, emulsions, syrups, elixirs, etc., or may be presented as a dry product for reconstitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use.Such liquid preparations may contain conventional additives such as suspending agents, flavoring agents, diluents or emulsifying agents. For parenteral administration or inhalation, solutions or suspensions of a compound of formula 1 with conventional pharmaceutical vehicles may be employed, e.g., as an aerosol spray for inhalation, as an aqueous solution for intravenous injection or as an oily suspension for intramuscular injection. The compounds may also be administered by means of inhalers or other devices which permit the active compounds in the form of dry powders to come into direct contact with the lungs. Standard procedures are used for the preparation of these compositions as described in U.S. 3,963,660. The compounds of the present invention or pharmaceutical compositions thereof may be administered to human asthmatic patients in single oral doses of approximately 1 1000 mg of active ingredient and multiple oral doses totalling up to about 4000 mg day of active ingredient. When administered by inhalation, lower doses are generally given, i.e., on the order of about 0.1 of the normal dosage for the particular compound in question. These values are illustrative only, however, and the physician of course will ultimately determine the dosage most suitable for a particular patient on the basis of factors such as age, weight, diagnosis, severity of the symptoms and the particular agent to be administered. METHODS OF PREPARATION To prepare the compounds of the present invention, a diaminopyrazine of the formula EMI5.1 wherein X is H, Br or C1, is used as the starting material. Where the starting material is a 3,5 dihalo 2,6 diaminopyrazine, it can be obtained by the method disclosed in U.S.P. 3,987,044 reaction of a tetrahalopyrazine with NH4OH under pressure and separation of the 2,3 diamino isomer from the resulting isomer mixture as a 1 1 association product with a ketone. The indicated diamino starting material is reacted with a C1 C4 alkyl oxalyl halide of the formulaEMI6.1 wherein Y is chlorine or bromine to give the esters of the present invention. When X is H, this can be followed by appropriate halogenation to give the esters wherein X is Br or C1. Treatment of any of the resulting esters with an appropriate metal hydroxide gives the corresponding metal salt. Alkali metal hydroxides and, particularly, sodium hydroxide, are preferred for this hydrolysis. Further optional treatment of the metal salt with a strong inorganic acid gives the corresponding free carboxylic acid. Acids such as hydrochloric acid are preferred for this purpose. Reaction of the free carboxylic acid with ammonia or a pharmaceutically acceptable amine then gives the corresponding ammonium salt. Although two different methods for the preparation of the halogen substituted compounds of the present invention are actually included in the procedure described above, the preferred method is to convert the 3, 5 dihalo 2, 6 diamino intermediate to 2,6 diaminopyrazine before reacting the amino groups with an alkyl oxalyl halide, preferably the chloride. Thus, an alkyl oxalyl halide reacts readily with the first amino group in halogen substituted diaminopyrazines but reaction with the second amino group occurs with difficulty.The process gives a mixture of the dioxamate with a relatively high proportion of the monooxamate and it is necessary to separate the mixture. However, 2,6diaminopyrazine is readily converted to the dioxamate, which can be halogenated cleanly to give the 3,5 dihalo compound. The sequence of reactions indicated above in which the greater reactivity of the 2 and 6 amino groups in an otherwise unsubstituted pyrazine can be utilized in the preparation of a final product having halogens in the 3 and 5 positions is an additional process aspect of the invention. This method of obtaining the 3,5 dihalo 2,6 dioxamic acid derivatives can be summarized by the following three steps 1 hydrogenolysis of a 2,6 diamino 3,5 dihalopyrazine to replace the 3,5 halogens with hydrogen 2 reacting the resulting 2,6 diaminopyrazine with an alkyl oxalyl halide ethyl oxalyl chloride, preferably to give the dioxamate and, 3 halogenating the resulting 2,6 dioxamate to give the corresponding 3,5 dihalo compound.These steps constitute a novel sequence of reactions, said sequence being a process aspect of the present invention. Although other methods for making various 2,6 dihalopyrazines are known, the preparation of the particular oxamide substituted pyrazines of the present invention by the indicated process is not known, to the best of the present Applicant s knowledge. Thus, the present process provides a convenient synthesis of the indicated compounds when the tetrahalopyrazine is readily available as the starting material and it could also be used to obtain the dioxamates without the halogens. METHOD OF ASSAY FOR ACTIVITY The anti allergic activity of the present compounds is demonstrated by the IgE mediated rat PassiveCutaneous Anaphylaxis PCA test. This test is generally accepted as one of the best animal models for the qualitative determination of antiallergic activity.Disodium cromoglycate is active in this test when administered i.p. but not orally. The method can be described briefly as follows PCA Test Method 1. Antisera Various standard methods described in the literature were used for the preparation of reaginic antisera to ovalbumin in either Hooded Lister or Brown Norway adult rats.2. Animals Adult male Sprague Dawley or female We star Kyoto rats were used as antisera recipients in the test. The animals were allowed to acclimate for 5 14 days with food and water ad lib. 3. Sensitization Recipient rats were passively sensitized by the intradermal injection of 100 microliters of two dilutions of antiserum one injection on each side of the back . Sensitization occurred 48 72 hours prior to antigen challenge.4. Administration of Test Compound Four to six animals were used for each test compound dilution. Compounds were homogenized in an appropriate carrier solution, and administered i.p. 5.minutes prior to challenge or p.o. 5 to 240 minutes prior to challenge. In both cases, an appropriate range of doses was used.5. Antigen Challenge and Reaction Evaluation Ovalbumin 0.1 1.0 mg in a 0.5 solution of Evan s Blue dye in saline was given to each rat by i.v. administration. Thirty 30 minutes later, the resultant PCA reactions were measured for average diameter and color intensity from the reflected surface of the skin. Test compound activity is expressed as percent inhibition based on control reactions.When tested by the above procedure, the compounds of the present invention were active both i.p. and orally. In addition to activity in the PCA test as described above, the compounds also inhibit the release of histamine in the rat Passive Peritoneal Anaphylaxis PPA test. This method can be described briefly as follows PPA Test Method 1. Antisera Reaginic antibody to ovalbumin for this test was prepared in adult male B6D2F1 mice.2. Animals Adult male Sprague Dawley or female Wistar Kyoto rats were used as antibody recipients. The animals were allowed to acclimate for 5 14 days with food and water ad lib.3. Sensitization Recipient rats were sensitized i.p. with 2 ml of an appropriate saline dilution of the mouse anti ovalbumin antiserum determined from prior experiments. Sensitiza tion took place 2 hours prior to antigen challenge.4. Administration of Test Compound Five to ten animals were used for each test compound dilution. Compounds were homogenized in saline with an equivalent of base to effect sclubilization, if appropriate, and adminis tered i.p. 30 seconds prior to antigen challenge or p.o. 5 to 60 minutes prior to antigen challenge, using an appropriate range of doses.5. Antigen Challenge and Assay Evaluation Two 2 mg of ovalbumin in 5 ml of modified Tyrode s Solution was administered by i.p. injection and the animals were sacrificed 5 minutes later. Peritoneal shock fluids were collected and clarified by centrifugation. Protein was removed from the samples by perchloric acid precipitation and subsequent centrifugation. The samples were then analyzed for histamine content by an automated fluorometric assay. Histamine levels of peritoneal shock fluids from treatment animals were then compared to those of shock fluids from control animals. Drug effect was expressed as percent inhibi tion of histamine release.
