# STRATIFIED INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE

## Abstract
An internal combustion engine having a plurality of cylinders, each provided with a normal inlet valve 4 and an exhaust valve is additionally provided with an auxiliary air admission system which includes an auxiliary inlet valve 5 for each cylinder, valve operating means 21,22,23,24 pro viding coordinated operation with the other valves of the cylinder, and a throttle valve 3 , interconnected with the carburettor throttle linkage. A further air inlet valve 1 located upstream of the air admission throttle valve 3 is spring biassed towards a closed position, against atmos pheric pressure which tends to open the valve. The auxiliary air admission system provides stratification of the engine inlet mixture and permits operation with reduced fuel consumption and is particularly advantageous for use with an engine having the mixture inlet valve recessed into the cylinder head so as to provide an auxiliary combustion chamber 6 .
