## Description
The present invention relates to a self extinguishing polycarbonate composition comprising, in mixture, a not halogenated aromatic polycarbonate and a mixture of additives conferring characteristics of self extinguishment to same polycarbonate. By self extinguishing polycarbonate composition a composition is meant, according to the present invention, comprising, in mixture, a not halogenated aromatic polycarbonate, and a mixture of additives conferring characteristics of self extinguishment to same polycarbonate, said composition being classifiable as V O in behaviour relatively to fire, evaluated according to UNDERWRITERS LABORATORIES, INC., BULLETIN 94, carried out on injection moulded or compression moulded test specimens having a thickness of from 1.6 to 3.2 mm. The need is being more and more felt in the art of having available polymeric compositions provided with high self extinguishment values, and that due to safety reasons. So, according to the known art, characteristics of self extinguishment can be conferred to polycarbonate by bonding on to the polymeric chains thereof substantial amounts of halogen especially chlorine and bromine , or blending polycarbonate either halogenated or not with additives capable of conferring said self extinguishment characteristics. The additives normally used to that purpose are fluorinated polyolephins, metal salts of not aromatic and halogenated carboxy acids and metal salts of aromatic sulphonic acids. For that known art, reference is made in particular to the disclosure of U.S. Patents 3005795, 3673278 and 4391935. When a polycarbonate conntaining substantial amounts of halogen bonded to polymeric chains is used, the drawbacks substantially occur deriving from the impairing of polymer s physical mechanical characteristics. On the other hand, it has been observed in practice that conferring high extinguishment characteristics V 0 according to the previously mentioned standard with so small amounts of self extinguishing additives as not to alter to a substantial extent said characteristics of polycarbonate, is extremely difficult. It has been found now that it is possible to overcome the drawbacks of the known art by means of a particular mixture of self extinguishing additives, capable of conferring characteristics of high flame resistance to polycarbonate, when used in amounts extremely reduced, and however lower than those causing undesirable changes in polymer properties. Accordingly, the present invention relates to a composition of self extinguishing polycarbonate comprising, in mixture, a straight or branched not halogenated aromatic polycarbonate, and a mixture of additives conferring characteristics of self extinguishment to same polycarbonate, formed by a salt of alkaline metal, of alkaline earth metal or of zinc, or mixed salt of these metals, of ethylene diaminotetraacetic acid b phenol terminated oligomer of polycarbonate from tetrabromobisphenol A, or decabromodiphenyloxide and c polytetrafluoroethylene wherein additives a , b and c are globally present in an amount of from 0.2 to 1.5 parts by weight per each 100 parts by weight of polycarbonate, the weight ratio of additive b to additive a varying within the range of from 1 1 to 16 1, the weight ratio of additive c to additive a varying within the range of from 0.5 1 to 6 1, and the composition showing moreover characteristics of self extinguishment classifiable by a V 0 rating according to UNDERWRITERS LABORATORIES, INC., BULLETIN 94. The not halogenated aromatic polycarbonates to which self extinguishing characteristics are conferred are those, known in the art, which are obtained by means of the polymerization of a diphenol with a carbonate precursor, e.g., phosgene. Polycarbonates from bisphenol A are preferred. Also arom atic compound with at least three functional groups can be used to yield branched polycarbonates. Polycarbonate can contain also other additives, such as pigments, thermo oxidative stabilizers, lubricants, dyes, fillers, radiation absorbers, and so forth. The additive a according to the present invention is a salt of alkaline metal, of alkaline earth metal, of zinc, or preferably a mixed salt of such metals of ethylenediaminotetraacetic acid EDTA . Specific examples of such additives are The additive b according to the present invention is a phenol terminated oligomer of polycarbonate from tetrabromobisphenol A, definable by means of following formula Alternatively, additive b of present invention is decabromodiphenyloxide. The additive c according to the present invention is polytetrafluoroethylene, of high molecular weight, and showing following physical characteristics bulk density comprised within the range of from 300 to 950 g l, and average particle size comprised within the range of from 0.5 to 600µ. In the preferred practical embodiment of the present invention, additives a , b and c are globally present in an amount ranging from 0.4 to 1.2 parts by weight per each 100 parts by weight of polycarbonate and the preferred weight ratios of additive b to additive a vary within the range of from 2 1 to 10 1, and those of additive c to additive a vary within the range of from 1 1 to 4 1. The compositions of self extinguishing polycarbonate according to the present invention are prepared by any means known in the art, and suitable to homogenize the additives with the polymer. In the preferred form of embodiment, the salt additives undergo a grinding up to reducing them to a powder with particle size of from 100µ to 0.5µ the powder so obtained is mixed with polycarbonate and the mixture is submitted to an extrusion, a polycarbonate granulated and provided with characteristics of high flame resistance being obtained. The self extinguishing additives according to the present invention are commercial products, easily available from the market and of very low cost. The mixture of additives according to the present invention is capable to confer to polycarbonate characteristics of high flame resistance with a V 0 rating according to the standard mentioned , when they are used in the global amounts and in the relative proportions which have been previously defined. Under these conditions, the mixture of additives does not cause undesirable changes of other characteristics typical of polycarbonate. In the following experimental examples, a not halogenated aromatic polycarbonate is used, obtained from bisphenol A and phosgene, having the following characteristics viscosimetric average molecular weight of about 35,000, with mechanical characteristics as indicated in Table 3, Example 1, and containing a white pigment of titanium dioxide which, as it is well known, acts negatively on behaviour of polycarbonate to flame. The self extinguishing additives and a white pigment of titanium dioxide are homogenized by milling on a RETSCH mill up to a powder with particle size of from 0.5 to 50µ, and the powder so obtained is mixed with polycarbonate. The mixture is introduced into an extruder heated at about 260 C and the extrudate is cooled and granulated. The granules are moulded both by compression 285 C 40 kg cm² , and by injection moulding at about 300 C , to obtain two types of specimens, and more precisely Specimens A five specimens for each of formulations reported in Table 1 are submitted to the test of behaviour to fire according UNDERWRITERS LABORATORIES, INC., BULLETIN 94 UL 94 standard . According to this Standard, the materials are classified as V 0 V 1 V 2, on the basis of the results, obtained with the five specimens, according to following criterion Moreover, all the five specimens must pass the test according to UL 94 Standard, otherwise they are given a rating on the basis of the behaviour of the worst specimen. If, for instance, a specimen shows a V 2 behaviour and the other four specimens show a V 0 behaviour, all five specimens are given a rating V 2. Finally, if a specimen continues burning over more than 30 seconds after having been removed from the flame of a Bunsen burner, it does not receive a rating according to UL 94 Standard, but is reported as burning specimen. Specimens B are submitted to the test of behaviour to fire according to ASTMD2863 77 Standard, which correlates the flammability of a polymeric material with the concentration of oxygen present in the atmosphere under which the same specimen is. This correlation is expressed as LOI Limiting Oxygen Index , i.e., as the minimum oxygen percentage capable of maintaining the combustion of the specimen under an oxygen nitrogen atmosphere impinging against the same specimen by flowing from down upwards. The value is moreover determined of Melt Flow Index MFI at 300 C and under 1.2 kg on extruded granulate and on said granulate kept at 300 C for 60 minutes. On the basis of these values, the thermal stability, as expressed by Other characteristics which are determined are the White Index ASTM D 313 Standard and the values of Flexural characteristics Maximum Load or Modulus in MPa ASTM D 790 Standard . In Table 1 the compositions of self extinguishing polycarbonate according to the present invention Examples 7 11 are reported together with comparison compositions examples 1 6 . The amount of additives is reported as amount by weight per 100 parts by weight of polycarbonate. In this Table the following abbreviations are used EDTA Ca, Na₂ calcium and sodium salt of ethylenediaminotetraacetic acid OPTA phenol terminated oligomer of polycarbonate of tetrabromobisphenol A, definable by the formula PTFE Commercial product Algoflon In Table 2 the characteristics of behaviour to fire UL 94 Standards of compositions of Table 1 are reported. In Table 3 the values are reported of LOI MFI g 10 at 300 C and under 1.2 kg Heat stability as hereinabove defined White Index and Flexural Strength Maximum Load and Modulus , in MPa. On examining the Tables, the effects on polycarbonate s behaviour to flame of the mixture of additives according to the invention appear unexpectedly favourable, in particular if they are compared to the efficacy of the individual additives and of couples of same additives. Moreover, no noticeable differences are observed between the mechanical properties of polymer as such, and same polymer with the additives.
