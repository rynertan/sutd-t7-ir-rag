# PLASTIC FIBER HAVING OPTICAL TRANSMISSION PROPERTIES.

## Abstract
A plastic fiber having optical transmission properties which consists of a core layer 1 , a sheath layer 2 and a protective layer 3 as fundamental constituent units. The protector layer 3 has a thermal deformation temperature HDT higher than 120 C, a thickness greater than 10 Âµm, and has a sectional area of greater than 0.07 times the total sectional area of the core layer 1 and the sheath layer 2 . This enables the plastic fiber to exhibit good optical trans mission properties even at high temperatures. More prefer ably, the plastic fiber having the optical transmission prop erties of the above mentioned structure is further provided with a plastic covering layer 4 which has a silane crosslink ed structure.
