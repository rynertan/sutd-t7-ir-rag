# Cross guide coupler.

## Abstract
The waveguide is adapted for combination with similar waveguide to form a cross guide coupler. Each waveguide 30, 32 includes opposing sidewalls 10, 11 , a coupling wall 12 and flanges 14, 15 extending from the sidewalls 10, 11 . Each flange 14, 15 has a contact surface in parallel with the coupling wall 12 and is positioned relative to the coupling wall 12 so that the contact surface thereof contacts the coupling wall of the other waveguide with which it is combined to form the cross guide coupler. The coupling wall of one of the wave guides 30 of the coupler includes a coupling aperture 34 . The coupling wall of the other waveguide 32 includes an opening 35 sufficiently larger than the coupling aperture to leave a substantial margin therebetween.
