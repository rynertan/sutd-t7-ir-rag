# Process for forming III V semiconductor MESFET devices, having self aligned raised source and drain regions.

## Abstract
A process for forming III V semiconductor MESFET devices having self aligned, raised source and drain regions is disclosed. A preferred embodiment relates to a process for forming gallium arsenide MESFET devices. A feature of the invention is placing a gate structure 5 on the gallium arsenide substrate 2. Then a process including molecular beam epitaxy, grows epitaxial gallium arsenide on each respective side of the gate 5, forming a raised source region 8 and a raised drain region 9. Gallium arsenide will not grow in a conductive state on top of the tungsten gate metal 5. The resulting MESFET device has a raised source 8 and drain 9 which significantly reduces the high resistance depleted surface adjacent to the gate which generally occurs in planar gallium arsenide MESFET devices. Furthermore, the MESFET channel region which is defined by the proximate edges of the source and the drain, is self aligned with the edges of the gate by virtue of the insitu process for the formation of the source and drain, as described above.
