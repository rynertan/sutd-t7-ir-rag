# Variable reluctance motion sensing system.

## Abstract
A variable reluctance motion sensing system for providing a signal indicative of the relative rotational motion between a first body and second body comprising magnetic pickoff means 32 for establishing a primary magnetic circuit having a first quantity of magnetic flux therein, mounting means 34 attached to said first body and adapted to coact with said magnetic pickoff means 32 for preferrentially orienting said magnetic pickoff means relative to said second body, and reluctance means 36 adapted to and rotatable with said second body and oriented relative to said magnetic pickoff means 32 therein forming part of said primary magnetic circuit for periodically changing the reluctance within said circuit thereby causing a change in the magnitude with respect to time of said first quantity of magnetic flux. The magnetic pickoff means comprises a ferromagnetic cup like outer pole piece 60 having a central axis 64 , a hollow walled member having a first and second end and an end member 62 , said end member 62 enclosing second end of said walled member forming a cylindrical cavity 61 and where said first end 66 is maintained perpendicular to said central axis forming a first pole face, a cylindrical inner pole piece 72 mounted within said walled member 60 upon said end member 62 colinear to said central axis 64 , forming a toroidal coin space 76 there between, said inner pole piece 72 having a second pole face 74 opposite said end member, said inner pole piece further comprising source means 70 for causing said inner 72 and said outer 60 pole pieces to achieve opposite magnetic polarities so that magnetic flux flows between said outer and said inner poles forming a first magnetic circuit signal generating means 78 responsive to the rate of change of the magnitude of flux flowing within said primary circuit.
