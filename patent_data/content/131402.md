# Method of assembling a lubricating oil sealing apparatus in a turbocharger.

## Abstract
A lubricating oil sealing apparatus for use of a tur bocharger 1 having a compressor wheel 4 for supplying a supercharged air through an intake passage 9 , a turbine wheel 2 driven by a force of an exhaust gas, and a driving shaft 3 connecting the compressor wheel 4 with the turbine wheel 2 . The apparatus is located between the compressor wheel 4 and the turbine wheel 2 , and has a labyrinth struc ture therein in order to prevent the lubricating oil from being suctioned into the intake passage 9 . In order to facilitate assembly of the labyrinth seal, the central hub thereof, the encircling retainer 15 and the annular deflector member 16 are formed as a unit to reduce assembly time.
