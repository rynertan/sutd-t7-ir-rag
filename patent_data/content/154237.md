# PHOTOPOLYMER FOR USE AS A SOLDER MASK

## Abstract
A polymer suitable for use as a solder mask comprised of an acrylated or methacrylated polyurethane having ter minal alkene unsaturation at each end has been synthesized. This polymer can be a liquid or a hot melt and when in a photopolymerizable composition it is suitable for roller coating or screen printing onto a printed circuit board substrate.
