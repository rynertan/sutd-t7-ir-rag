## Description
PROCESS FOR PREPARING AN ALKYL ARYL SULPHONATE CONCENTRATE COMPOSITION This invention relates to a process for preparing an alkyl aryl sulphonate concentrate composition, to compositions obtained thereby, and to their use in enhanced oil recovery processes. The use of alkyl aryl sulphonates in enhanced oil recovery techniques is nçell known. US Patent Nos. 3,799,263 and 3,861,466 describe the use of alkyl xylene sulphonates, more particularly Cm,20 alkyl orthoxylene sulphonates, in enhanced oil recovery processes. In such processes the alkyl aryl sulphonates are typically incorporated at low concentration, e.g. of the order of 1 w w, in a brine for injection into an oil bearing formation, or may be used in soluble oil compositions which are injected into a reservoir prior to water flooding e.g.as described in US Patent No. 4,022,699 . In general, suitable brine and oil, in the form of crude oil, will be available at the point of use. It is therefore desirable to bring the alkyl aryl sulphonate to the point of use in as concentrated a form possible consistent with convenience of handling. Alkyl aryl sulphonates, such as sodium alkyl xylene sulphonates, are themselves of a thick, pastelike consistency, which tends to make them inconvenient to transfer from one container to another and gives rise generally to problems of transport and handling. Dilution of the alkyl aryl sulphonates with materials other than those which need themselves to be transported to the point of use, for inclusion with the alkyl aryl sulphonates in the enhanced oil recovery process, necessarily adds to transport costs and to increased material costs. US Patent No. 4,022,699 discloses soluble oil compositions containing alkyl aryl sulphonates, ssecifically in the form of petroleum sulphonate, together with a stabilising agent, which may be inter alia an aliphatic alcohol. These compositions are prepared by admixing the alkyl aryl sulphonates part of which are already in the form of a solution in oil and the stabilising agent in at least 35 v of a liquid hydrocarbon gas oil, gasoline or crude petroleum . There are alsa disclosed soluble oil additive concentrates for subsequent dilution with the liquid hydrocarbon, prepared by admixing the alkyl aryl sulphonates with the stabilising agent.However, in the only example described of such a concentrate Example 16 , the stabilising agent is ethylene glycol monobutyl ether and the alkyl aryl sulphonates employed are oilcontaining solutions of petroleum sulphonates such that the final concentrate contains more than 20 v of oil. US Patent No. 3,769,209, and the corresponding Canadian Patent No.1,011,215 also discloses a soluble oil additive concentrate prepared by admixing alkyl aryl sulphonates with secondary butyl alcohol s butanol .However, in all the examples the alkyl aryl sulphonates, which are pe petroleum sulphonates, are employed in the form of oil containing solutions such that the final concentrate contains more than 19 v of oil. Surprisingly there has now been discovered a readily effected process by which a flowable alkyl aryl. sulphonate concentrate composi tion may be prepared, which process does not depend upon substantial quantities of oil being present in the final composition. According to the present invention there is provided a process for preparing an alkyl aryl sulphonate concentrate composition by neutralising at least one alkyl aryl sulphonic acid of general formulaEMI2.1 where n is 1 or 2 and R is a C8 18 alkyl group, with an equivalent amount of a neutralising agent, which process comprises the steps of a mixing an aqueous solution containing at least 10 w w of neutrali sing agent with at least one C29 saturated alcohol, and b mixing the resulting mixture with the alkyl aryl sulphonic acid of formula I, the relative quantities of the aqueous solution and the at least one alcohol being such that the resulting neutralised mix ture contains 5 to 40 parts by weight of the at least one alcohol per 100 parts by weight of alkyl aryl sulphonate salt. The acids of formula I are advantageously Cg g alkyl xylene sulphonic acids, i.e. n in formula I is 2, and R in formula I is prefer ably a Cm 16 alkyl group, more preferably a C11 16 alkyl group. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that choice of an optimal alkyl aryl sulphonic acid for enhanced oil recovery is dependent inter alia on salinity levels in the particular oil bearing formation concerned. The neutralising agent may conveniently be an ammonium or, preferably, an alkali metal hydroxide. Sodium hydroxide has been found to be very satisfactory. The upper limit on the concentration of neutralising agent in the aqueous solution is determined by the solubility of the agent. If desired a saturated solution may be employed. The concentration of alkyl aryl sulphonate salt and the at least one alcohol in the neutralised mixture from step b will be dependent upon the neutralising agent employed and its concentration in the aqueous solution however in general the alkyl aryl sulphonate concentration will be found to be in the range 53 to 895 w w and the concentration of the at least one alcohol will be in the range 2.65 to 27 w w, the balance being water and minor amounts of incidental components. Preferably the aqueous solution contains at least 20 w w, more preferably at least 30 w w, and advantageously 40 to 50 w w, of the neutralising agent. The at least one C29 saturated alcohol is preferably a alkanol such as isooropanol, s butanol, n butanol, isobutanol, t butanol, t amyl alcohol, methyl isobutyl carbinol, 2 ethylhexanol or a mixture of C39 alkanols, e.g. a mixture of C79 primary alcohols such as that sold bv members of the Royal Dutch Shell group of companies under the designation LINlZVOL 79 registered trade mark . Thus step a in the process of the invention preferably comprises mixing the aqeuous solution with at least one C39 alkanol. S butanol, especially, has been found to give very acceptable results. The process of the invention may be effected over a wide range of temperatures, e.g. 10 C to 800C. Thus components from stock, at temperatures e.g. from 100C to 40 C, may be used, or the alkyl aryl sulphonic acids may be used directly after production, when their temperatures are commonly in the range 550C to 750C, The process of the invention may thus conveniently be effected at ambient temperatures of at least 100C. Steps a and b may be carried out batchwise or continuously. In a batch process the order of mixing of the components in step a is immaterial, but in step b the alkyl aryl sulphonic acid should be added to the resulting mixture from step a , or the acid and the mixture should be simultaneously streamed into a mixing vessel, in order to minimise exposure of the alcohol component or components of the mixture to unneutralised acid. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention the process includes the further step c of mixing the neutralised mixture from step b with up to 100 parts bv weight, advantageously 5 to 40 parts bv weight based on the alkyl aryl sulphonate salt of a cosurfactant selected from one or more alcohol ethoxy sulphates, alcohol ethoxvlates, alcohol ethoxy acetates, alcohol ethoxy sulphonates and alphaolefin sulPhonates. Preferably the surfactant is at least one alcohol ethoxy sulphate. The cosurfactant preferably has average molecular weight in the range 300 to 750, more preferably 370 to 450. Hhen the co surfactant is an alpha olefin sulphonate, it preferably contains 8 26 carbon atoms. The invention also includes aLkyl aryl sulphonate concentrate compositions whenever prepared by the process of the invention, and the use of such a composition in an enhanced oil recovery process. Alkyl aryl sulphonate concentrate compositions prepared by the process of the invention have been found to be flowable, easily handled liquids. The invention will be further understood from the following illustrative Examples. EXAMPLES 1 to 3 Compositions were prepared by mixing 18 parts by weight s butanol and sufficient quantities of aqueous solutions of sodium hydroxide sodlun hydroxide concentrations of 46 w w and 24 w w to neutralise 100 parts by weight of an alkyl o xylene sulphonic acid blend containing 87 w w pure acid having average equivalent weight 400 and wherein the alkyl moiety contains 11 to 16 carbon atoms. To each of the resulting s butanol hydroxide mixtures at ambient temperature 200C was added with stirring 100 parts by weight of the alkyl o ene sulphonic acid. The resulting compositions were clear, golden, mobile liquids. To 94 parts by weight of the composition prepared using aqueous hydroxide of concentration 46 w w was added 6 parts by weight of an alcohol ethoxysulphate DOBANOL 25 35 60 registered trade mark containing 58 60 active matter of average molecular weight 441 derived fran C1215 alcohols and containing on average 3 ethoxy moieties per molecule. For comparative purposes a similar procedure to the above was carried out using an aqueous sodium hydroxide solution of concentration 15 w w.
