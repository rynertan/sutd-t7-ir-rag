# Substrate for mounting integrated circuit chips.

## Abstract
A novel substrate 10 is disclosed which can mount either flip chip solder bonded IC chips 12 or wire bonded chips 18 , or both chips, or a single chip having both solder bonds and wire bond. The substrate has an array of solder pads 26, 28 which will accept solder bonds. Those pads 28 which are to be used for wire bonding have mounted thereon a trimetallic pedestal 30 . Each pedestal has a layer 32 of solder metal bonded to the solder pad, a top layer metal 34 suitable for wire bonding, such as, aluminum or gold, and an intermediate layer 36 of metal, such as nickel, which is impervious to both solder metal and the top layer metal.
