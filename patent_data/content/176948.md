# LINEAR PERISTALTIC PUMP

## Abstract
The invention relates to a peristaltic pump wherein a plurality of cam actuated fingers are adapted to pump fluid through a flexible tube by sequentially closing off the fluid filled tube along a length thereof. The fingers are mounted to rotate on a common axis and are spaced from one another in order to reduce the power requirement for operating the pump. A rigid, spring loaded pressure pad, preferably mounted on the same axis as the cam actuated fingers, maintains essentially the same pressure on each of the fingers as they close off the adjacent portion of the tube.
