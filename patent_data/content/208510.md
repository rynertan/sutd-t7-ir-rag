## Description
1 SUBSTITUTED OXINDOLE 3 CARBOXAMIDES AS ANTI INFLAMMATORY AND ANALGESTC AGENTS Rheumatoid arthritis, which affects 3 4 4 of the population, is characterieed by inflammation and pain of joints. While the etiology of rheumatoid arthritis is not completely understood, both steroid and non steroidal antiinflammatory therapy has been used to alleviate the symptoms of this illness. It is to this latter class of non steroidal antiinflammatory agents that the compounds of the present invention relate. In accordance with the instant invention it has now been found that a group of novel oxindoles are useful as analgesic and antiinflammatory agents. More specifically, the novel compounds of this invention are of the formulaEMI1.1 and the pharmaceutically acceptable base salts thereof, wherein X is hydrogen, fluoro, chloral, bromo, alkyl of one to four carbon atoms, alkylthio of one to four carbon atoms, alkoxy of one to four carbon atoms, cycloalkyl of three to six carbon atoms, nitro, trifluoromethyl, acyl of two to four carbon atoms, benzoyl or thenoylt Y is hydrogen, fluoro, chloral, bromo, alkyl of one to four carbon atoms, alkoxy of one to four carbon atoms or alkylthio of one to four carbon atoms . X and Y when taken together are 4,5 , 5,6 or 6,7methylenedioxy A is NH R2, R3 or Nh CO R3 R1 and R2 are each hydrogen, alkyl of one to six carbon atoms, cycloalkyl of three to seven carbon atoms, heterocyclic or methylated heterocyclic wherein said heterocyclic is pyridyl, thienyl, furyl, pyrrolyl, thiazolyl, oxazolyl, imidazolyl and isoxazolyl, or a group of the formulaEMI2.1 wherein W is hydrogen, fluoro, chloral, bromo, alkyl of one to four carbon atoms, alkylthio of one to four carbon atoms, alkoxy of one to four carbon atoms, acyl of two to four carbon atoms, trifluoromethyl or cycloalkyl of three to six carbon atoms and Z is hydrogen, fluoro, chloral, bromo, alkyl of one to four carbon atoms, alkoxy of one to four carbon atoms or alkylthio of one to four carbon atoms and R3 is alkyl of one to six carbon atoms or phenyl. A preferred group of compounds of the invention are those in which R1 isEMI2.2 wherein W is hydrogen, fluoro, chloral, bromo, alkyl of one to four carbon atoms, alkylthio of one to four carbon atoms, alkoxy of one to four carbon atoms, trifluoromethyl, acyl or cycloalkyl of three to six carbon atoms and Z is hydrogen, fluoro, chloro, bromo, alkyl of one to four carbon atoms, alkoxy of one to four carbon atoms or alkylthio of one to four carbon atoms and A is NH2 or CH3. Within this preferred group, particularly preferred compounds are ti those wherein X and Y are both hydrogen ii those wherein X is 5 chloro and Y is hydrogen and iii those whereinX is 5 chloro and Y is 6 fluoro. The compounds of the invention of formula 1 are useful for treating inflammatory diseases and also as analgesic agents in mammalian subjects. In addition, the instant invention embraces pharmaceutical compositions, which comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and a compound of the formula 1, wherein the weight ratio of the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier to said compound of the formula 1 is in the range of from 1 4 to 20 1. One of the processes employed in the preparation of the novel compounds of this invention consists of the interaction of an appropriate oxindole derivative with a requisite isocyanate as follows EMI3.1 wherein R1, A, X and Y are as previously defined. This reaction leading to the products of the instant invention is carried out in a reaction inert solvent. Preferred solvents are polar, aprotic solvents such as dimethylformamide, diethylformamide,N methyl 2 pyrrolidone or dimethyl sulfoxide. Further, it is preferred that the reaction be carried out in the presence of a base. Such bases include alkali and alkaline earth metal hydrides or a tertiary organic amines. The preferred base is triethylamine. In practice, the isocyanate is added to the oxindole derivative and base in the appropriate solvent. It is preferable to employ about a molar equivalent of the isocyanate and two molar equivalents of base, with best results achieved by using an excess of as much as 20 of isocyanate and 140 of base. It is preferred that the reagents be combined in the cold, generally from 5 to 0 C., and that the reaction mixture be allowed to stir at these temperatures for from one to four hours. The reaction can be allowed to warm to room temperature, in which case the reaction is complete in 30 60 minutes. Upon completion the reaction can be added to water and acidified to a pH of 2 to 5 using an acid such as hydrochloric acid, or the reaction mixture can be added directly to a 1N solution of hydrochloric acid. The filtered product can be purified by recrystallization from an appropriate solvent or solvents, or by chromatography. A second reaction leading to the novel compounds of the present invention consists of the interaction of an appropriate amine with an oxindole, as follows EMI4.1 wherein R1, A, X and Y are as previously defined, and R is alkyl of one to four carbon atoms. This reaction leading to the products of the present invention is also carried out in a reaction inert solvent. Preferred solvents are aprotic aromatic solvents such as benzene, toluene or xylene. In practice, the reagents are combined in the appropriate solvent and heated to the reflux temperature of the solvent. It is preferable, in conducting this aminolysis reaction, to employ at least an equimolar amount of amine, although a 100 molar excess of the amine is especially preferred. To assist in removal of the alcohol by product formed in the reaction a Soxhlet containing molecular sieves is fitted to the reaction condenser. Using reflux temperatures of the solvents, the reaction is generally complete in 1 to 2 hours. The product can be isolated by cooling the reaction mixture and filtering the product or by adding the reaction mixture to an acidified aqueous solution followed by filtration of extraction of the product and removal of the solvent. Purification can be carried out by recrystallization or chromatography. The oxindole starting reagents for these processes are prepared by methods known to those skilled in the art and by the herein described procedures. The requisite isocyanates are either commercially available or can be prepared by standard procedures known in the art, for instance, Zook and Wagner, Synthetic organicChemistry, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York, 1956, page 640. It is noted that a common characteristic of many non steroidal antiinflammatory agents is their acidic nature. Each of the oxindole carboxamides of the instant invention shares this property and is an effective proton source. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of the present invention are also therapeutic agents, wherein the preferred cations of said salts include the ammonium, sodium and potassium ions. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds described herein are prepared by conventional procedures, as for example, by adding the acid to an aqueous solution containing an equivalent amount of the pharmaceutically acceptable base, i.e., a base containing one of the above preferred cations, followed by concentration of the resultant mixture to obtain the desired product.The bases can be selected from hydroxides, oxides or carbonates. Also considered part of the present invention are 3 enol ethers and acyl ester prodrugs of the herein described compounds. These prodrugs, which have fewer gastrointestinal side effects, breakdown in situ to the parent compound. As previously indicated, the oxindole 3 carboxamides of the present invention and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts are useful antiinflammatory agents. These compounds are of value in alleviating swelling and inflammation which are symptomatic of rheumatoid arthritis and related disorders which are responsive to treatment with antiinflammatory agents. Either as individual therapeutic agents or as mixtures of therapeutic agents, they may be administered alone, but are generally administered with a pharmaceutical carrier selected on the basis of the chosen route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice.For example, they may be administered orally in the form of tablets or capsules containing such excipients as starch, milk sugar or certain types of clay, etc.They may be administered orally in the form of elixirs or oral suspensions with the active ingredients combined with emulsifying and or suspending agents.They may be injected parenterally, and for this use they, or appropriate derivatives, may be prepared in the form of sterile aqueous solutions. Such aqueous solutions should be suitably buffered, if necessary, and should contain other solutes such as saline or glucose to render them isotonic. The weight ratio of the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier to compound can be from 1 4 to 20 1. The dosage required to reduce inflammation or swelling in arthritic subjects would be determined by the nature and extent of the symptoms. Generally, small doses will be requied initially, with a gradual increase in the dose until the optimum level is determined. It will generally be found that when the composition is administered orally, larger amounts of the active ingredient will be required to produce the ame level as produced by a smaller quantity administered parenterally. In general, from about 1.0 to about 30 mg. of active ingredient per kilogram of body weight, administered orally in single or multiple dose units, will effectively reduce inflammation and swelling. Parenteral administration requires doses of from about 0.5 to about 20 mg. per kilogram of active ingredient to achieve the same end point. A standard procedure for detecting and comparing anti inflammatory activity of compounds is the carrageenin rat foot edema test, which is described byC.A. Winter et al., Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol., vol. III, page 544 1962 . In addition to being useful as anti inflammatory agents, the compounds of the present invention can be used in the treatment of asthma, bronchitis and psoriasis they can also be used as analgesic agents.
