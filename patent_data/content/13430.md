## Description
IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO I IAL UNITS FOR TELEPHONE SETS This invention relates to a dial unit for a telephone set comprising a substantially flat plate having a bearing portion formed therein adapted to support a dial shaft, a return spring adapted in return the dial shaft after a digit has been dialled and a pear train adapted to drivp a governor. It is knnwn particularly frnm British ent No. 1,444,580 t.o nrovide a bearing in R substantially flat plate for supporting thp dill shaft nf n telephone set in combination with second bearing formed in a second plate snacedlv mounted frorn. the first plate. British Patent No. 1,444,580 also discloses the use of a return spring and a gear train mounted between the two plates, the gear train being adapted to drive a governor also mounted between the two plates. The second plate is formed into a cover like member to enclose the return spring, the gear train and the governor and most of the parts are formed in plastics material. Whilst the object of the invention in BritishPatent No. 1,444,580 is to produce 8 compact and cheap dial unit for a telephone , use is made of a second plate to support the dial shaft and the gear train, return spring and governor are all located between these two plates The arrangement necessitates a fairly substantial second plate to be made and indeed this is formed into a cover to enclose the various parts.This second r latp needs to. be securely positioned to the first plate since it supports the end of the dial shaft, and the whole dial unit will not be particularly chean although most of the 77arts are formed in a plastics material. nor compact since the return spring, the gear train and the governor are all located between the two sheets. The invention as claimed seeks to overcome these drawbacks by only supporting the dial shaft in the bearing portion formed in t.he one plate, locating the return spring on one side of the plate end mounting thp gear train and the governor on the opposite side of the plate, the governor being of the centrifugal type, Thus since the dial shaft is only supported by the one bearing the requirement for a second dial shaft supporting plate is alleviated, although a lightweight second plate may be used to support, various parts of the gear train. By arranging the return spring on one side of the plate, and the gear train on the other side 9 more compact dial unit is achieved.A centrifugal governor is also compact and the whole dial unit is thus compact, light in weight and relatively cheap, particularly since most of t.he parts are formed in a plastics material. An embodiment of the invention will now be described by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a longitudinal cross sectional view of a dial unit for a telephone set in accordance with the invention, Figure 2 is a rear view of the dial unit with the mechanism in one of its operating positions and, Figure 3 is a rear view of the dial unit with the mechanism in another operating position. The dial unit consists of a circular plate 10 having a central bearing 12 which is adapted to support a shaft 14. On the left hand end as viewed in Figure 15 of the shaft 14 is rigidly secured a finger wheel 16, and between the finger wheel 16 and the plate 10 is located a shaft return spring 18 which is in the form of a coiled leaf spring. The outer end of the return spring is secured to a cage 20 which in turn is secured to the shaft 14, whilst the inner end of the return spring is fixed to the plate 10. The return spring 10 is intended to return the finger wheel back to a predetermined position against a stop not shown in well known manner. On the right hand end of the shaft 14 is secured an impulse plate 22 which comprises a gear wheel 24 formed integrally with a set of teeth or gams 25 best seen in Figures 2 and 3 . The gear wheel 24 meshes with a gear wheel 26 and the Fear wheel 26 is mounted on the same shaft 52 as a gear wheel 23. The rear wheels 26 and 28 are connected together by a one way clutch 30 which is in the form of a xoil spring rotatinn of the gear wheel 26 in a clockwise direction when viewed in Figure 2 causinr the clutch to slin, and the gearwheel 28 is not driven. Anticlockwise rotation of the gear wheel 26 will flock the clutch and allow the gearwheel 28 to rotate also in an anti clockwise direction. The gear wheel 28 meshes with a gear 34 which is secured to a centrifugal governor 36. The centrifugal governor 42 consists of two weights 38 and 40 pivoted horizontally on a flange 36 on vertical sinus 44 and Z and held in position bv tension springs 48 and . The end of each weight 38 and 40 is provided with an extension 52 and 54 respectively, and these extensions are adapted to rub on a stationary circular member not shown when the weights 38 and 40 move outwards under centrifugel force as the governor 36 rotates. The rubbing action of the extensions 5 and 54 on the stationrv member restricts the speed of the governor depending on the force of the springs 48 and 50. Also mounted nn the same side nf the plate 10 as the gear train by a bolt 66 is a block 56 which contains three sets of contacts 58, 60 ad 62. The sets of contacts 60 and 62 are open and the set of contacts 58 are closed when the dial unit is inoperable, the sets 60 and 62 closin as soon as the dial is retated, and the set 58 opening and closing a predetermined number of times depending on the digit dialled when the dial is released, in known manner. The governor 42 and the shaft 32 are supported between the plate 10 and a bearing plate 64, and also supported between the nlate 10 and the bearing plate 64 is a pivoted trigger 70 The trigger comprise le,F 68 having a projection 72 and a flexible wet 74, the trigger being formed from a plastics material so that the web 74 is formed integrally with the. leg 68 and the projection 72, but is thin enough to be deformable against a pillar 76 projecting from the plate 10.The bearing plate is secured tri the plate 10 bv bolts on screws 78 and n. Figure 2 illustrates the positions the component adopt when a digit is dialled on eThe dial nit i.e. the dial is rotated in a clockwise direction, and the gear 24 is rotated in an anticlockwise direr irrn when viewed in Figure 2. Figure 3 illustrates thc positions adopted by the components when the dial 2 S allowed to return under the action of t.he return spring 18 i.e. the gear 24 rotates in a clockwise direction when viewed in Figures 2 and 3 . Referring therefore to Figure 2, a digit is being dialled on the dial unit and the gear wheel 24 together with the cams 25 rotate in an anticlockwise direction. The gearwheel 24 drives the gear wheel 26 but the gear 28 does not necessarily move depending upon the force required to rotate the governor 49, the tightness of the clutch 30 and the sneed of dialling i.e. the clutch 30 can and most likely will sli at this time. The leg 68 of the trigger 70 contacts each of the cams 25 in turn, the web 74 being urged against the pillar 76 and being deformed as shown as each cam passes the end of the leg 68. The web 74 then returns the end of the leg into a position between adjacent cams 25 after each cam has passed the end of the leg 68. When the required digit has been dialled end the finger wheel 16 is released, the gear wheel 24 together with the cams 25 potate under the action of the return spring 18 in a clockwise direction and the trigger 70 moves to the position shown in Figure 3.The gear wheel 26 now moves in an anti clockwise direction, the clutch 30 locks, and the gear wheel 28 drives the gear 34 and bence the centrifugal governor 42 in a clockwise direction. The centrifugal governor thus limits the sneed of rotation of the gear wheel 24 and the cams 25. The cams 25 successively contact the lea 68 and the projection 72 is successively moved into contact with one of the parts 80 of the set of contacts 58. The part 8 consists of n spring steel strip carrying a contact, and this contact is moved away from the other associated contact each time the projection 72 strikes it. The part 80 also acts as a return spring, pushing the leg 68 down between adjacent cams 25 via projection 72 whilst at the same time allowing the two contacts of the set 58 to make. Thus as the gearwheel 24 returns, the set of contacts 58 makes and breaks a certain number of times depending on the digit dialled on the finger wheel.If a second digit is dialled on the fingerwheel, the leg 68 of the trigger 70 is swung back into the position shown in Figure and the operations described above are re ted. All the components of thd dial unit conveniently be formed in a plasties material excent for certain items such as the gear shafts.the sets of contacts 58, 60 and 62, and governor weights 38 and 40, and it will be seen that the components can be quickly and cheaply made using injection moulding techniques. The simple centrifugal governor also enables only simple spur gears to be used. The left hand side of the plate 10 as viewed in Figure 1 can also be used as a number plate, the numbers being printed on the plate or etched into the surface of the plate 10.
