## Abstract
A device for securing andor registering the stencil frame for a screen printing machine, said screen printing machine having amongst other things a printing table and a scraper and or ink application device arranged above the printing table. Between the printing table and the scraper arrange ment are arranged one or more organs 6, 7 intended to interact with the stencil frame 5 . These organs are designed in such a way that the stencil frame 5 is able to be moved or displaced as a single unit from an initial position outside the screen printing machine to an appropriate position inside the screen printing machine, and vice versa. Inside the screen printing machine are present registering organs 8, 9 intended to guide the stencil frame into a registration positton. The organs intended to interact with the stencil frame comprise at least two guides 6, 7 running parallel to each other, along which the stencil frame 5 is capable of being displaced. In addition means 8, 9 are provided for forcing the stencil frame against one of the guides 7 before registration.
