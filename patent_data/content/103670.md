# High resolution superconductive sampling circuit.

## Abstract
The invention is an all soliton sampler for accessing very high speed circuits. A solution is switched in two parallel branches, one including the device under test 7 and the other including a programmable delay line 8 implemented in soliton devices. The outputs of these two branches are used as controls to a soliton comparator 9 to 14 which, in turn, controls a Josephson detector gate 17 . This circuit permits a relatively slow rise time external trigger pulse to initiate an extremely narrow sampling pulse.
