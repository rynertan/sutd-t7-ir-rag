# Alumina zirconia abrasive.

## Abstract
Abrasive properties of co fused alumina zirconia are improved by the addition of from 0.1 to 2 of Y₂O₃ to the fusion mix and quenching the fused product. Y₂O₃ ores containing mostly Y₂O₃ with lesser amounts of rare earth oxides can be substituted for high purity Y₂O₃.
