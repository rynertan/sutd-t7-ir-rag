# Elbow joint prosthesis.

## Abstract
A prosthesis 10 for replacing a hinge type bone joint includes a first component 12 having a body portion defining a plurality of generally semi circular distal bearing surfaces 46 extending therefrom and a proximally extending intramedullary canal stem. A second component 14 has a body portion defining a convex posterior surface, a plurality of semi circular grooves configured to matingly receive the distal bearing surfaces of the first component 12 , and a distally extending intramedullary canal stem 64 . The second component 14 may further define a laterally positioned capitulum process having a distal surface 94 adapted to be abutted against by the head of a radius bone 89 upon implantation in cases where the prosthesis replaces an elbow joint. The first component 12 defines an aperture and the second component 14 includes a hook like member adapted to detachably and hingingly interconnect the components in a slipfit fashion.
