# IMPROVED ON OFF AND SELECTOR VALVE OF THE BALL TYPE, AND VALVE ASSEMBLY USING THE SAME

## Abstract
The valve comprises a body 10 having three or five ways, and a ball type closure plug 12 provided with an inner channel 20 set at an angle of 90 . The valve is actuated by a pneumatic actuator and permits to select two or four of the possible flow directrices or to intercept the flow completely. Sealing is improved by the adoption of an assembly constituted by an inner seat member 22 and an outer seat member 26 locked together by a ring 28 and biased by springs 32 adapted to press a sealing ring 30 , made of elastomeric material and coated with a sheath 31 , against the ball type closure plug 12 . The five way valve 40 and the three way valve 42 can be coupled through the respective axial apertures to provide a valve assembly adapted to be used for discharg ing partitioned tank trucks for petroleum products to dis pensing counters.
