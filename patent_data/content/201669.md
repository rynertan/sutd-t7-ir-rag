# Direct current arc furnace or ladle.

## Abstract
Direct current arc furnace or ladle with at least one arcing electrode 3 and at least one hearth connection 6 8 . According to the invention the hearth connection 6 8 comprises graphite containing bricks 7 which, prior to laying, have been heat treated at a temperature in excess of 350 C, whereby volatile components have at least partially escaped and coking has occurred to obtain a lower electrical resistivity of the bricks in comparison with untreated bricks or bricks treated at a lower temperature.
