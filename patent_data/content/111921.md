## Description
NONCONSUMABLE ELECTRODE ASSEMBLY This invention relates to a method of connecting a metallic electrical conductor to an electrically conductive ceramic electrode body to make an electrode assembly which is suitable for use in producing metal by electrolysis. A number of materials includingimetals such as aluminum, lead, magnesium, zinc, zirconium, titanium and silicon, for example, can be produced by electrolytic processes. Although individual processes may vary in some respects from one to another, each employs the use of an electrode which must operate in a highly corrosive environment. An example of such a process for the production of metal is the well known Hall Heroult process hereinafter referred to as the Hall process for producing aluminum in which alumina dissolved in a molten fluoride salt bath is electrolyzed at temperatures from 9000C. to 10000C. In the process as generally practiced today, carbon is used as an anode to reduce the alumina, and the reduction produces molten aluminum, and the carbon is oxidized to primarily form C02 which is given off as a gas. Despite the common usage of carbon as anode material in practicing the Hall process, there are a number of disadvantages to its use. Since carbon is consumed in relatively large quantities in the Hall process, approximatoly 42otto 550 kg per ton of aluminum produced, the anode must be constantly repositioned or replenished to maintain the proper pacing with the cathode in the cell to produce aluminum efficiently. If prebaked anodes are used, it may be seen that a relatively large facility is needed to produce sufficient anodes to operate an aluminum smelter. Furthermore, to produce the purity of aluminum required to satisfy primary aluminum standards, the anode must be relatively pure carbon, and availability and cost of raw materials to make the carbon are of increasing concern to aluminum producers. Because of the disadvantages inherent in the use of carbon as an anode, there has been a continuing search for inert or nonconsumable materials that can operate as an anode with a reasonable degree of electrochemical effidiency and withstand the high temperature and extremely corrosive environment of the molten salt bath. A number of different types of materials have been suggested and tried, including ceramic oxides, metals and ceramic transition metal borides and carbides, and gaseous fuels, such as natural gas or hydrogen, as the reactant in a fuel cell type anode. From published literature, few, if any, materials tried will survive for a prolonged time in an aluminum electrolysis cell however, some ceramic oxides have been reported to be corrosion resistant during cell operation.A recent review of literature and patents relating to inert anodes for use in producing aluminum may be found in articles entitled inert anodes for aluminum electrolysis in Hall Heroult cells I by Kari Billenhaug and H. A. plye, Volume 57, 2, Aluminum, 1981, and Inert anodes for aluminum electrolysis in Hall Heroult cells II by Kari Billehaug and H. A. e, Volume 57, i3, Aluminum, 1981. A major problem in the development and use of nonconsumable anodes for producing aluminum by electrolysis has been that of providing a satisfactory method for making a connection between an electrically conductive ceramic material and a metal conductor leading from the cell to a power source. In a typical operation of a Hal cell using carbon as the anode, the anode is formed into a block having a rectangular cross section and a metallic rod or bar is embedded therein by providing a hole in the block, inserting the rod in the hole and filling the void between the rod and the block with molten iron. When the iron solidifies, it shrinks tightly around the bar and away from the hole surfaces of the carbon block, but disengagement is prevented by adapting the block so as to engage the solidified iron.Such an adaptation is providing recesses in the hole side wall, for example. When the above described assembly is positioned in a Hall cell having a salt bath which is maintained at approximately 10000C., the rod, cast iron and carbon in the connection zone rise in temperature from room temperature to approximately 7000 to 8000C. The rod, cast iron and carbon in the connection zone expand due to this temperature rise and a substantially tight and reasonably efficient electrical connection is effected.Because the rod and cast iron are relativley free to expand longitudinally, the principal electrical contact between the body and the metal due to the thermal expansion is along the lateral surfaces. When ceramic materials are used for anode bodies, however, such a connection is not satisfactory for a number of reasons. When using carbon as the anode body, it is desirable that it be in a block form because it is consumed during the electrolytic process and a large block or mass minimizes the frequency with which anodes must be replaced.It is not desirable, on the other hand, to provide an anode of ceramic materials in a large mass or block because, typically, ceramic anode bodies are more expensive to make than are carbon anode bodies, and the carbon materials are typically better conductors of electricity than are ceramic materials used in inert anodes. As has been previously noted, the carbon anode to metal bar connection utilizing cast iron as the connecting medium relies primarily upon the lateral surfaces of the cast iron being in substantially tight contact with the lateral surfaces adjacent to the hole in the carbon block to effect a reasonably satisfactory electrical connection. Variations in electrical conductivity of such a connection due to such thingsas irregularities in the cast iron and carbon block surfaces, for example, may be tolerated because of the relatively short time span over which an 4ndividual carbon block functions as an anode. In the case of an anode made from ceramic materials, however, most of the ceramic materials which are suitable for use as anodes are less efficient electrical conductors than carbon and, furthermore, to be effective, the anode must function over an extended period of cell operation time. Assuring a continuous intimate contact between the ceramic anode body and metal conductor is considered to be more critical, therefore, than the contact required between a carbon block and metal conductor. Ideally, the connection of a nonconsumable anode material to a metal conductor for use in the electrolytic production of metal must be corrosion resistant, have a minimal voltage drop across the connection, and function to mainta in the integrity of the ceramic material when subjected to temperature differentials on the order of 10000C. A number of methods for making connections of ceramic materials to metal conductors in the electrolytic production of aluminum have been proposed. Klein U.S. Patent 3,718,550 proposes three different methods. In one of the methods, a ceramic anode tube, having a closed end, contains molten silver and a titanium carbide rod connected to a current supply extends down into the molten silver pool. In a second method, the inner surface of the tube is covered with a thin layer of silver or platinum and a hollow cylinder of nickel alloy wire mesh is inserted into the tube to contact the silver or platinum layer and is connected with nickel alloy wires to a conductor leading to the current supply. In the third method, the closed end ceramic anode tube contains nickel powder, and a rod of zirconium diboride connected to a conductor leading to the current supply is inserted into the nickel powder. AlderU.S. Patent 3,960,678 shows ceramic anode bodies of various shapes in contact with the electrolyte.Adjacent to the anode, but not in contact with the electrolyte, is a material designated as a current distributor which may be a metal such as Ni, Cu, Co, Mo or molten silver or a non metallic material such as a carbide, nitride orboride. Power leads connected to the current distributor may be made of the same materials, and it is suggested that the current distributor and power lead may be a single piece.The patentee does not describe how the various connections are to be made. De Nora et al U.S. Patent 4,187,155 suggests attaching lead in connectors to ceramic electrodes by fusing the connector into the electrode during the molding and sintering process or by making an attachment after sintering, but does not describe any method for making such attachments so as to avoid fracture of the ceramic in use. Suggestions or descriptions for making metal bonds between ceramics and metals by welding, brazing or other methods of metal bonding have been made. Patents dealing with such methods, for example, are Hackley et al U.S.3,022,195, Cheng U.S. 3,414,963, Matchen U.S. 3,152,871,Zimmer U.S. 3,284,174, Walker U.S. 3,839,779, Burgess et alU.S. 3,911,553, Schmidt Bruechen et al U.S. 3,915,369,Babcock et al U.S. 3,993,411 and Cusano et al U.S.3,994,430. None of these patents, however, are concerned with connecting an electrically conductive metallic oxide ceramic electrode body to a metal conductor for use in producing a metal by electrolysis. Heretofore, it has not been believed possible to make such a connection in producing a metal because of fracture of failure of the joint due to expansion and or contraction of the assembly over the extreme temperature differential involved in production of metal by electrolysis. It would be desirable, therefore, to provide a method for joining a ceramic body to a metal conductor for use in producing metal by electrolysis. According to this invention there is provided a nonconsumable electrode assembly suitable for use in the production of metal by electrolytic reduction of a metal compound dissolved in a molten salt, the assembly comprising a metal conductor for conveying electrical energy a ceramic electrode body having free metal or metal alloy in at least a portion thereof for making a connection between said metal conductor and said ceramic body and a connection between said metal conductor and said portion of said ceramic electrode body, said connection formed by a metal bond between said free metal or metal alloy with a portion of said metal conductor. Also provided in accordance with this invention is a process for producing metal by electrolytic reduction of a metal compound dissolved in a molten salt, said process including providing a nonconsumable anode assembly by the steps of providing a metal conductor for conveying electrical energy providing a ceramic electrode body having free metal or metal alloy in at least a portion thereof for making a connection between said metal conductor and said ceramic body and connecting said ceramic body to said metal conductor by providing a metal bond between a portion of said metal conductor and the free metal or metal alloy in the portion of said ceramic body having the free metal or metal alloy therein. This invention is for an assembly of a nonconsumable ceramic electrode body and a metal conductor which is suitable for use in the production of metal by electrolytic reduction of a metal compound dissolved in a molten salt. The assembly is effected by providing a metal bond between the ceramic body and metal conductor, such as by welding, brazing, friction welding or diffusion welding.The ceramic body may be comprised of any ceramic and or combinations of metals and ceramics which are suitable for use as an electrode in a process for producing a metal by electrolysis and include in at least the portion of the body to be connected to the metal conductor a level o free metal or metal alloy sufficient to effect a metal bond. It is to be understood that the word ceramic as used herein with reference to this invention is intended to include those combinations of ceramics and metals commonly referred to as cermets. In the practice of this invention, such free metal or metal alloy of such ceramic must have a higher melting temperature than the maximum temperature the ceramic body will be subject to during the operation of a cell in producing a particular metal by electrolysis.In producing aluminum, for example, ceramics which include Ni or NiFe as a free metal or metal alloy are suitable for use in an assembly of this invention, but the subject invention is not limited to the examples just cited. Other free metals or metals which may combine to produce metal alloys include, for example, Fe, Al, Mg, Ca,Co, Si, Sn, Ti, Cr, Mn, Zr, Cu, Nb, Ta, Li, Y, Pt, Pd andIr. Further, the scope of this invention is.intended to include any electrode body which may have a suitable ceramic layer as an exterior surface. For example, it has been suggested that an electrode might be made by flame spraying or plasma spraying a coating of ceramic material onto a base material such as titanium, nickel, copper, a carbide, a nitride, etc. Ceramic materials which have shown the best potential heretofore for use as nonconsumable electrodes in an electroXytic process for producing metal are metal oxides and combinations of metals and metal oxides called cermets, but it is not intended that this invention is limited to metal oxide and or cermet materials. The free metal or metal alloy may be provided by at least partially reducing by the use of a suitable reductant at least one of the metal compounds present inthe ceramic body in an area where the metal bond is to e effected. Other methods of providing an e8sentiallw metallic connecting surface on the anode might also be suitable. For example, free metal might be provided in a cermet by intro ducing metal particles into a ceramic mixture prior to sintering. As an alternative, a layer of metal might be applied to the surface of the ceramic body to be connected by plating, plasma spraying or chemical vapor deposition, for example. After providing the metal in a tanner proposed by the foregoing examples, a metal bond between the ceramic anode body and metal conductor rod can be made. The metal conductor may be any metal that is suitable for use as a conductor in a particular electrolytic process, can be joined to the electrode body with a metal bond connection, and is compatible with the electrode in the cell environment. That is, no adverse reaction between the ceramic material and the metal arises from the connection of the two materials. For purposes of this invention, the term metal bond is intended to mean a bond that is formed between the metal conductor and the free metal or metal alloys in the ceramic body as may be. accomplished by such techniques as welding, with or without the use of a metal welding rod, brazing, diffusion welding, or friction welding, for example. friction welding is intended to mean any method of welding whereby the heat necessary to effect the weld between the two bodies is generated by friction between the two bodies, and includes such welding methods known as inertia welding, for example. In diffusion welding, a joint or connection is effected between two articles by the migration of particles from one article to another or by a mutual migration of particles between the articles when a surface of one article is in intimate contact with a surface of the other article.Application of pressure, heat, or a combination of heat and pressure, to the contacting surf aces hastens the diffusion of at least some of the material in one article into the other article to effect a connection.

For convenience, preferred embodiments of this invention will be described with reference to producing aluminum by electrolysis, but the scope of the invention is intended to include its use in the production of other metals by electrolysis as well. In these preferred embodiments any ceramic material may be used for the body that is suitable for use as an anode in the electrolytic production of aluminum and includes therein at least in the portion of the body to be joined to the metal conductor a level of free metal or metal alloy sufficient to effect a metal bond between the conductor and ceramic body. A preferred composition of the ceramic body is comprised of metal oxides and a zaire preferred composition of materials is 20 wt. Fe, 60 wt. NiO and 20 wt. Fe304. To make an anode body to be used in the practice of this invention, the foregoing materials are placed in a suitably shaped mold and are reaction sintered in an argon atmosphere at a temperature of approximately 12750 to 13500C. for approximately four hours under a pressure of approximately 25,000 psi 172 MPa .Such reaction sintering results in an interwoven network of metallic material and oxides, the metallic material containing Ni Fe alloy and the oxide material containing Ni,Fe O and NixFe3 xO4. For purposes of this invention, the shape of the body is not critical it may be of any shape or configuration which provides an accessible surface for making a metal bond connection with the metal conductor. Shapes suitable for an assembly of this invention are shown in Figs. 1, 2 and 8. Referring to Fig. 1, the anode body 10 is a cylindrical cup having a bottom wall 12 and side wall 14. The thickness of the walls need be only that which is adequate to provide the structural strength necessary for the size of anode body required and the corners of the cup may be provided with a radius if desired. The anode body 10 in Fig. 2 is a cylindrical solid, but may be of any desired cross section adaptable for effecting a metal bond. Fig. 8 is similar to Fig. 1 whereby the body 10 is cylindrical and includes a bottom wall 12 and a side wall 14. A cylindrical stub 16 projecting upwardly from the bottom wall 12 is further provided for convenience in making an assembly with a metal conductor, as wsll be explained later. To provide an appropriate connection surface on the anode body, an area of connection is reduced by con tacting the area with a reducing agent, such as carbon for example, and sufficient heat is applied to reduce the metal oxide or oxides to a metal or metallic alloy. The manner of using carbon at the reducing agent is not critical to the practice of this invention, and suitable temperatures and time to accomplish the desired reduction would be known to one skilled in the art. Typically, the cup 10 as shown in Fig. 1 is filled with a carbonaceous material 20 and heated to a temperature greater than 9000C. to at least partially reduce a zone 18 of the metal oxide material at and adjacent to the surfaces contacted by the carbonaceous material. The time of heating may vary depending upon the extent of reduction desired.An anode body 10, such as that shown in Fig. 2, is simply layered with a carbonaceous material 20 and processed in a manner as described for processing the anode body shown in Fig. 1. Typically, it is believed that the composition of the material in the reduced zone 18 is comprised of Ni, NiFe alloy as free metal and metal alloy in a ceramic matrix of Ni,Fe O and NixFe3x04. It is believed that by varying the time and or temperature of heating, zone 18 could be reduced to substantially all free metal or metal alloy. The extent of reduction required, however, is only that necessary to effect a metal bond between the metal conductor and the ceramic body of sufficient strength to maintain the assembly during its intended use as an anode in an electrolytic process for producing metal such as aluminum. As an alternative to the use of carbon as a reductant, heating in the presence of hydrogen or a hydrogeno material is a satisfactory method for reducing the metal oxide or oxides to primary metals or metal alloys. Thus, a portion of the anode body is converted to a section that is highly resistant to thermal shock and has a laSer in cluding free metal or metal alloy which blends into the ceramic oxide body through a transition zone of variable composition. To effect an assembly between the ceramic body and metal conductor by diffusion welding, as shown inFigs. 3 and 4, an end of the metallic rod or bar 40 is placed in intimate contact with the surface of the reduced portion 18 of the body 10 and the assembly is then heated in an inert atmosphere while applying pressure through the contacting surfaces. The amount of heat and or pressure applied is largely a matter of choice. In general, the greater the heat and pressure, the lesser is the time required to effect an adequate bond. The rod or bar may be comprised of any metal or alloy suitable for making the diffusion weld 42. The weld 42 is shown as a dashed line to indicate that the diffusion weld of an assembly of this invention is a merger of the two bodies wherein the metal particles of the two bodies become intermingled and thus a metal bond is provided. In this preferred embodiment, suitable temperature, pressure and time to effect a diffusion weld are, for example, 10000C. for 48 hours with 24 pounds of pressure applied longitudinally through the rod from a weight imposed against the upstanding rod end. Alternatively, to effect a metal bond 42 and make an assembly 30 between the ceramic body and metal conductor, as shown in Figs. 3 and 4, a metallic rod or bar 40 is welded to the reduced section of the anode body 10 by friction welding, preferably by inertia welding. The rod or bar may be comprised of any metal or alloy suitable for attachment by friction walding to the particular metallic surface bf the anode body. The embodiment shown in Fig. 3 may be advantageous in making a friction weld between the ceramic body and metal conductor because less ceramic material is required to make a body having equivalent surface area than if a solid body such as that shown in Fig. 4 were employed. To effect a metal bond between the cer,amic body and metal conductor as shown in Figs. 9 and 10, a metallic rod or bar 40 is welded by an arc welding method such asTIG welding, for example, to the reduced section of the anode body 10 and thus provides a metal bond through weld 42.The rod or bar may be comprised of any metal or alloy suitable for attachment by welding, brazing or the like to the particular metallic surface of the anode body. The embodiment shown in Fig. 10 having a stub 16 projecting upwardly from the bottom wall 12 may be advantageous in making the weld 42. Where the surface of the body to be joined contains Ni and NiFe, for example, a suitable rod or bar is comprised of Ni or Ni alloy, but it is apparent that other metal alloys capable of being joined by friction welding could also be used as metal conductors. In one method of friction welding, the conductor rod and ceramic body workpieces to be joined are coaxially mounted in opposed chucks of a lathe with the surfaces to be joined adjacent each other. One chuck is fixed and the other is adapted to rotate in relation to the fixed chuck, and means for applying an axial force through one workpiece against the other workpiece is also provided. To effect a weld, the rotatable chuck is caused to rotate at a predetermined speed and, while rotating, axial pressure is applied from one of the workpieces to the other workpiece for a brief time, and then the pressure is released momentarily. The application and release of pressure cycle is then repeated sequentially until the workpieces have been heated sufficiently by friction between the surfaces to be joined to effect a plastic or semi molten condition in at least one of the workpieces, at which point rotation of the chuck is stopped and sufficient axial pressure is applied from one workpiece to the other to effect a union of metal particles in one workpiece with metal particles in the other workpiece and thus make a connection having a zone of metal particles from one workpiece merged with metal particles from the other workpiece.The speed of rotation, pressures, times of pressure application and other parameters of the method vary with the types of material and sizes of the bodies to be joined. A preferred method of friction welding is designated as inertia welding and is preferred over m method such as that just described because it is faster, and the heat zone from the generated friction is more localized and more generally confined to the connection area. In inertia welding, the apparatus for making the weld is substantially the same as that described above except an inertial mass or flywheel and clutch are provided on the shaft of the rotating chuck. To make an inertial weld, the workpieces to be joined are mounted in the chucks with the surfaces to be joined opposed to each other, and the shaft having the rotating chuck and the flywheel thereon is brought up to a predetermined speed, at which point axial pressure is applied through the parts for a brief time, the clutch is then disengaged and, while maintaining axial pressure, rotation is continued from the energy of the rotating flywheel until the flywheel stops. Through selection of the proper flywheel mass, pressure and length of time to sustain the pressure for the given materials and size of parts, a connection such as that previously described as produced by friction welding may be effected. Fig. 6 shows an alternate embodiment of an assembly of this invention which adds a measure of protection against corrosion of the principal current carrying portion of the connection when the assembly is used in the electrolytic production of a metal. The elements of the assembly 30, prior to friction welding, are an electrode body 10 and metal conductor 40, as shown in Fig. 5. The electrode body 10 is a closed end cylinder, preferably having an opening 16 which tapers inwardly from top to bottom. The body 10 preferably has the composition of materials described in connection with the embodiments shown in Figs. 1 and 2 and is reaction sintered and provided with a reduced portion 18 within the opening in a manner as previously described. The workpieces 40, 10 are friction welded into the assembly 30 is shown in Fig. 6 by the method previously described to make the assemblies shown in Figs. 3 and 4. As has been previously noted in friction welding bodies, the heat generated by the friction betweenvthe two bodies makes the metals in the bodies plastic in a zone adjacent to the heat generating body surfaces. When longitudinal pressure is then applied to effect the metal bond connection, at least some portion of the plastic metal is displaced as is evidenced by the upset that occurs between the two bodies while making the weld. In the assembly 30 shown in Fig. 6, the displaced metal 17 is utilized to fill, at least in part, the void between the body 10 and the rod 40 positioned in the opening 16. It may be seen that as the plastic metal 17 is displaced from the longitudinal pressure on the bodies, it is forced upwardly to fill at least some portion of the void between the body 10 and the rod 40 positioned in the opening 16.The extent of the upward movement of the plastic metal 17 is a function of a number of variables, such as the dimensional relationship between the rod 40 and the body opening 16, for example.Tapering of the opening 16 in the body is not essential, but it may be seen that the taper facilitates upward movement of the metal. Further, the extent of a welded metal bond connection away from the heat generating surfaces of the rod 40 and body 10 will vary with the extent of the temperature increase in the rod 40 and body 10 away from the heat generating surfaces. It is believed that with the proper dimensional relationship between the rod 40 and the body opening 16, and the use of suitable speed, pressure and weld cycle time in effecting the weld, the entire void surrounding the rod 40 can be filled with displaced metal 17 and a metal bond effected between the rod and body throughout the total depth of the opening 16. Whether the void is completely filled or not, it may be seen that an assembly such as that shown in Fig. 6 would provide a connection having optimal strength, and displaced metal 17 would also function to shield the primary current carrying portion 19 of the connection adjacent to the bottom of the opening 16 from the products of electrolysis when the assembly is used in the electrolytic production of metal, as will now be explained. Use of an assembly of this invention for producing aluminum by a typical electrolytic process is described with reference to Fig. 7. A container 50 suitable for containing a molten salt bath 60 is adapted as a cathode.Suitable cell materials and construction thereof are known to those skilled in the art. The composition of the molten salt bath 60 is typically comprised of A1203 dissolved in a molten salt wherein the weight ratio of NaF to AlF3 is maintained at approximately 1.1 and the salt bath further includes approximately 5 wt. CaF2 and 5 wt. A1203. An anode assembly 30 of this invention as previously described is suspended in the molten salt bath by attaching the metal conductor 40 with a clamp 70 or other suitable suspension means known to those skilled in the art to a support means 80, and a positive lead from a power source is attached to the conductor 40.Preferably, the assembly 30 is suspended in the bath 60 with the upper edge of the anode body 10 above the level of the bath to minimize attack from the salt bath and products of electrolysis on the reduced interior of the body and the metal conductor 40. In operating the cell, the bath 60 is maintained at approximately 96O0C. and a current density of approximately 6.5 amps in2 1 amp cm2 of surface area of the bottom of the anode body 10 is maintained with an anode tocathode distance of approximately 1 1 2 inches 38 mm . The process, when performed in such amanner, causes reduction of the dissolved A1203 with oxygen liberated at the anode 10 and molten aluminum 90 settling and collecting on the bottom of the cell 50. The following examples are offered to further illustrate making a ceramic oxide body to metal conductor connection by a method of this invention. Example 1 A series of test assemblies of ceramic metallic oxide anode bodies and metal conductor rods were made with a Model No. 90B Inertia Welder, made by ManufacturingTechnology, Inc., a subsidiary of Adams Engineering , Inc., Mishawaka, Indiana, U.S.A. The ceramic anode bodies were cylindrical solids with a 19 mm diameter and a 41 mm length and were comprised of 20 wt. Fe, 60 wt. Nio and 20 wit. Foe304. The cylinders were reaction sintered in an argon atmosphere at a temperature of approximately 12750C. for four hours at a pressure of 25,000 psi 172 MPa . An end surface of each cylinder was then reduced to provide a surface having free metal particles therein by providing a layer of carbon on the surface to be reduced and heating the cylinder at a temperature of approximately 10000C. for 12 hours in an argon atmosphere. Metal conductor rods for connection to each cylinder were alloy 200 nickel and were 19 mm diameter x 52 mm long, and a portion on the end to be joined was machined to 12.7 mm diameter x 12.7 mm long. The reduced surface of each anode cylinder and the end of each conductor rod to be joined were dry ground to a 32 PMS finish. In making each anode body conductor rod assembly, the anode body was mounted in a chuck in the weld machine which was adapted to rotate the body about its longitudinal axist Since the ceramic material is relatively brittle, the body was encased in the chuck with the surface of the body to be joined to the metal rod recessed a distance of 2 mm from the face of the open chuck endv Providing support for the body in this manner prevented fracture of the body from the longitudinal force imposed upon the body during joining of the body to the rod by inertia welding. The conductor rod was mounted in a non rotating chuck in coaxial alignment with the anode body with the surface of the rod to be joined opposite of and spaced apart from the surface of the body to be joined. As noted previously, a portion of the conductor rod on the end to be joined was machined to a diameter of 12.7 mm and a length of 12.7 mm to insure sufficient clearance between the rod and the anode body chuck when the body and rod Sere joined with the anode body and metal rod workpieces moulted in the welding machine, the anode body was rotated at a predetermined speed, the anode body and metal rod were moved longitudinally in relation to one another to exert a predetermined axial load at the interface of the two workpieces for a brief period of time.Friction between the opposing faces of the body and rod quickly generated sufficient heat to place the metal particles in the body and the metal in the rod at and adjacent to the faces of the rod and body in a plastic state and continuation of the applied force caused fusion of the two workpieces at their interface.A clutch on the drive shaft having the anode body chuck thereon was then disengaged whereupon the shaft continued rotation at a decelerating rate from the effect of the inertial weight on the drive shaft until the rotation was stopped by the cooling and metallic fusion of the metals in the workpieces. A summary of the speeds, pressures and other criteria relative to making the welded samples is shown in Table I. From a visual observation, each sample assembly appeared to be uniformly fused at the interface of the two workpieces and was judged to be satisfactorily welded for purposes of this invention.

It is thus an indication of the extent of fusion at the interface of the workpiedes. 3 Weld cycle is the total time of acceleration of the rotating body, the application of pressure, and deceleration of the rotating body. 4 Actual weld time is equal to the deceleration time. Two of the above test assemblies were tested in a process for producing aluminum. Each of the samples was tested in an electrolytic cell adapted for the production of aluminum, the cell containing a bath composition having NaF to A1F3 in toe weight ratio of approximately 1.1 and containing 5 wt. CaF2 and 5 wt. Awl203. In conducting the test the anode body was lowered into the electrolyte with the upper reduced anode surface and welded connection above the bath level, and the free end of the nickel rod was connected to a power lead from a current source. The cell was operated at an average bath temperature of 9600C. and a current density of 6.5 amps in2 1 amp cm2 with an anode to cathode distance of approximately 1 1 2 inches 38 mm . One test assembly was run for 48 hours and the other was terminated after 9 hours due to a failure of the test cell equipment not related to the inert anode assembly.During the tests, current to each anode was individually monitored and controlled. Because of limited accessibility to the cell, the connection voltage was not monitored, but measurement of the total voltage drop in operating the cell indicated that the voltage drop across the connections was satisfactory. Examination of the anodes after their respective runs revealed that the welds were intact and that the assemblies were suitable for producing aluminum in accordance with the process employed in the tests. Example 2 A cup shaped ceramic metallic oxide body approximately 75 mm O.D. x 55 mm I.D. x 70 mm high was produced from 20 wt. Fe, 60 wt. .NiO and 20 wt. Fe304 materials.The materials were mixed and placed in a rubber or flexible cup shaped mold and reaction sintered is an argon atmosphere at a pressure of 20 ksi and 13500C. for 12 hours. The cup was then filled with carbon mastic cement and heated in an argon atmosphere at a temperature of 10750C.for 24 hours to reduce at least the bottom interior surface of the cup to provide a zone adjacent the surface which included Ni or Ni and NiFe. A nickel 200 alloy rod 1 1 4 inches in diameter x approximately 6 inches long was positioned within the cup with the bottom rod surface in intimate contact with a portion of the bottom interior surface of the cup. The cuprod assembly was then heated in an argon atmosphere at a temperature of 10000C. for 48 hours with 24 pounds of pressure applied longitudinally through the rod from a weight imposed against the upstanding rod end, and a diffusion welded joint between the anode body and the metal rod was effected. A boron nitride cover having an opening therethrough to accommodate the 1 1 4 inch diameter rod was then applied over the cup opening, and the seams between the cover and the cup lip and the conductor rod were sealed with a boron nitride paste. Although not considered essential to the invention, the boron nitride cover was provided as a safeguard to prevent the bath or products of electrolysis from contacting the reduced portion of the body, the conductor rod or the diffusion welded connection. A 3 8 inch diameter nickel 200 alloy rod was then attached to the free end of the 1 1 4 inch diameter conductor rod and the assembly was suspended in a Hall cell with the lip of the cup above the bath level by connecting the 3 8inch diameter rod to an overhead bus support. The Hall cell bath was comprised of 80.7 wt. cryolite, 12.4 wt. AlP3, 5.0 wt. CaF2 and 1.9 wt. A1203 and was operated at a temperature of approximately 9600C., with an anode current density of 1 amp cm2 6.5 amps in2 and an anode to cathode distance of approximately 38 mm 1.5 in . The cell was operated for 79 hours in producing 820 grams of essentially aluminum metal, and the average connection voltage drop was 0.19 volt. Example 3 Four cylindrical anode bodies comprised of 20 wt. Pe, 60 wt. NiO and 20 wt. Fe304 composition and having average diameters of 26 mm and 74 mm lengths were reaction sintered in an argon atmosphere at a temperature Ïf approximately 12750C. for four hours at a pressure of 25,000 psi 172 MPa and the top surface of each was reduced by contacting the surface with a layer of carbon to provide the carbon and heating the anodes in an argon atmosphere to a temperature of 10000C. for 12 hours. A 1 4 inch diameter nickel 200 alloy rod was then welded to the body by a TIG welding method using nickel alloy as the filler metal. Each of the samples was then tested in an electrolytic cell adapted for the production of aluminum, the cell containing a bath composition having NaF to A1F3 in the weight ratio of approximately 1.1 and containing 5 wt. CaF2 and 5 wit. A1203. In conducting the test the anode body was lowered into the electrolyte with the upper reduced anode surface and welded connection above the bath level, and the free end of the nickel rod was connected to a power lead from a current source. The cell was operated at an average bath temperature of 9600C. and a current density of 6.5 amps in2 1 amp cm2 with an anode to cathode distance of approximately 1 1 2 inches 38 mm . The test was run for 96 hours and current to each anode was individually monitored and controlled. Because of limited accessibility to the cell, the connection voltage on only two of the anodes could be measured and the average voltage drop on those two anodes over the entire 96 hour run was .04 volt. Examination of the anodes after the run revealed no cracking of the anodes and only minor pit type erosion corrosion over the exposed surfaces. Example 4 4 In this example a cylindrical anode body having approximately a 75 mm diameter and 70 mm length and comprised of the same composition of materials as the anode body in Example 3 was reaction sintered and reduced on its upper surface by the methods described in Example 3. An Ni 200 alloy rod, approximately 30 mm in diameter, was welded to the reduced surface by a TIG welding method using nickel alloy as the filler metalAfter completing the weld, some cracking was noted around the weld area and the assembly was then heated to 10000C. and allowed to cool at room temperature to relieve any stresses that might have been present. The sample was then tested in an electrolytic cell in a manner as described in Example 3 and was tested for 96 hours. During the course of the test the average connection voltage drop was observed to be 0.30 volt. Examination of the anode after completion of the test disclosed that the pretest cracks in the anode had not grown during operation of the cell. While the invention has been described in terms of preferred embodiments, the claims appended hereto are intended to encompass all embodiments which fall within the spirit of the invention.
