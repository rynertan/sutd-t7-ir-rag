## Description
NOVEL ACETANILIDES AND THEIR USE IN THE REGULATION OF THE NATURAL GROWTH OR DEVELOPMENT OF TURF GRASS Field of the Invention The invention herein pertains to novel acetanilides and the use of these acetanilides to regulate the natural growth or development of turf grass. Background of the Invention Many compounds are known in the art to regulate the natural growth of turf grass. Unfortunately, most of these compounds have associated activity which prevents their widespread use. Some of the compounds are phytotoxic causing discoloration and thinning of the turf grass with the regulation of the natural growth. Other compounds suffer from unexplainable inconsistent biological activity. Still other compounds have a low margin of safety which results in phytotoxicity in overlapped areas or with incorrect usage. However, the heed for such growth regulating chemicals is increasing in areas difficult to mow, such as roadsides, hills and the like. Chemicals with less phytotoxicity, more uniform biological activity, and greater margin of safety are desirable to enable effective management of turf grass. Summary of the Invention The present invention relates to a novel class of 2 chloro 2 trifluoromethyl N amidomethyl acetanilides and the method of using these compounds for regulating the natural growth of turf grass. The novel compounds of the present invention are represented by the formula EMI1.1 wherein R1 is hydrogen, C1 4 alkyl, C1 4 alkoxy or halogen R2 is hydrogen, C1 4 alkyl, alkenyl, alkoxy, haloalkyl C1 2 alkylamino, C1 2 alkylthio, C3 4 cycloalkyl, C2 6 alkoxyalkyl, C2 6 alkylthiomethyl, amino, phenoxy, phenamino, or furan 3 iS hydrogen or C1 4 alkyl and R4 is hydrogen or C1 2 alkyl. The method of the present invention involves regulating the natural growth of turf grass by applying to the grass an effective plant regulating, nonlethal amount of a compound of the present invention. The term turf grass is generally considered as encompassing a variety of both warm and cool season grasses which are employed in the development and or management of certain areas for specific purposes, such as utility, beautification, and recreation.Examples of such turf grass include Tall Fescue, RedFescue, Kentucky Blue Grass, Bermuda Grass, St.Augustine Grass and the like. Among the areas in which turf grasses are most frequently used are roadsides, golf courses, parks, and grounds which surround large educational or industrial institutions and, of course, the lawn of homeowners. In all of such areas it is readily apparent that a chemical treatment which serves to regulate the growth of turf grass is highly desirable since it will serve to minimize the time and cost expended on maintenance. A more thorough disclosure of the present invention is presented in the detailed description which follows. Detailed Description of the Invention The present invention relates to a novel class of 2 chloro 2 trifluoromethyl N amidometh acetanilides and a method for regulating the growth of turf grass by application of these compounds to the turf grass. The compounds of the present invention have the formula EMI3.1 wherein R1 is hydrogen, Ci 4 alkyl, C1 4 alkoxy or halogen R2 is hydrogen, C1 4 alkyl, alkenyl, alkoxy, haloalkyl C1 2 alkylamino, C1 2 alkylthio, C3 4 cycloalkyl, C2 6 alkoxyalkyl, C2 6 alkylthiomethyl, amino, phenoxy, phenamino, or furan R3 is hydrogen or C1 4 alkyl and R4 is hydrogen or C1 2 alkyl. Preferred species of the compounds of the present invention include 2 chloro 2 trifluoromethyl N acetamidomethyl acetanilide 2 chloro 2 trifluoromethyl 6 methyl N acetamidomethyl acetanilide and 2 chloro 2 trifluoromethyl 3 ,6 dimethyl N acetamido methyl acetanilide. The term alkyl refers to both straight chain and branched chain alkyl radicals. The term alkenyl refers to both straight chain and branched chain alkenyl groups of the type CnH2n 1. The term alkoxy refers to both straight chain and branched chain alkoxy radicals containing alkyl or alkenyl groups as defined above. The term 1alkylthiomethyl refers to a methyl group substituted by an alkylthio group. The term haloalkyl refers to an alkyl group substituted by one or more halogen atoms.Preferably, trichloromethyl is avoided. The term phenoxy refers to both substituted and unsubstituted radicals of the formula phenyl O . The term phenamino refers to both substituted and unsubstituted radicals of the formula phenyl NR where Rc is hydrogen or alkyl.. The method of the present invention involves application of an effective plant regulating, nonlethal amount of the compounds of the present invention to the plant locus of the turf grass. Regulating the growth of turf grass involves altering the natural growth of the turf grass to enhance various horticultural features of the grass. As employed herein, the term natural growth designates the normal life cycle of the grass in accordance with its genetics and environment in the absence of artificial, external influences. Regulation of the growth of turf grass can include retarding the amount of natural vegetative growth of the grass and or retarding or reducing the natural formation of seedheads in turf grass. The regulation of natural growth of turf grass does not include killing or herbicidal action.By application to the plant locus is meant application to the plant s growing medium, such as the soil, as well as to the plant parts, such as roots, stems, and leaves.Preferably, the compounds are applied to establish turf grass. Application of the compounds to emerging seedlings may result in injury. It is believed that the compounds of the present invention are absorbed into the plant through the roots. Therefore, it is desirable after application of the compounds of the present invention to the turf to water the turf to thereby wash the compounds into the soil. Watering of the turf is conveniently done within a short period of time after applying the compounds, e.g., within from about 3 hours to about 48 hours. A sufficient amount of water should be utilized to transport the compounds to the root zone. Depending upon the type and composition of the soil, conveniently about 1 inch to about 1 inch of water is utilized. In selecting an appropriate regulating amount of the compound of the present invention, it will be recognized that the effective regulating amount will vary with the plant species being treated, its stage of development, the specific compound being utilized, and the type of regulating effect being sought. The degree of regulating effect will vary with each species depending upon the absorption, trans location, and biological activity of the compound towards the species. An effective regulating amount will normally vary from about 0.1 to about 10 lbs. per acre. Conveniently a rate of from about 0.5 to about 5 lbs. per acre will be utilized. However, those skilled in the art will be able to determine an effective regulating amount of the compound for each species of turf grass and each specific compound. In order to maximize the amount of regulation of the growth of turf grass, it is advantageous to apply the compounds of the present invention to the turf grass during the period beginning with green up and prior to initiation of seedheads. Green up t is the transition of turf grass from dormancy winter phase to the active growth phase. Initiation of seedheads in the turf grass is defined as the physical appearance of seedheads at the base of the turf grass stem. Generally, it is preferred to apply the compounds of the present invention to the turf grass at about 75 to 100 green up. Application of the compounds to the turf grass prior to initiation of green up may result in retarding the green up of the grass. Application of the compounds after initiation of seedheads will render them substantially ineffective in retarding the growth of seedheads. However, the compounds will still retard the vegetative growth of the turf grass. Those skilled in the art will be able to apply the compounds of the present invention to the turf grass at the appropriate time. For the homeowner, the application of the compound to the turf grass may be conveniently made after the first mowing of the grass. The compounds of the present invention appear to regulate the growth of turf grass by inhibiting new tiller elongation growth for a limited period of time and also inhibit further growth of established tillers for a limited period of time.However, it is to be understood that each compound may not produce identical regulatory effects on each species or at every rate of application. Further, the visible morphological changes observed may result from a variety of physiological alterations by use of each of the compounds of the present invention. A variety of processes can be utilized to prepare the compounds of the present invention. One process comprises reacting the corresponding N chloromethyl acetanilide with the desired nitrile generally in accordance with the procedure of the well knownRitter reaction. Generally the acetanilide is mixed with a slight molar excess of the nitrile under a dry atmosphere, such as nitrogen, to prevent hydrolysis of the acetanilide. The mixture is then slowly added to sulfuric acid at an elevated temperature e.g., 50 60 C . After the addition, the mixture is stirred until the reaction is completed. Then the mixture is added to an excess of water ice to form the product. Another process for preparing the compounds of the present invention comprises reacting the corresponding 2 chloro N alkoxymethyl acetanilide with the desired nitrile generally in accordance with the procedure of the well known Ritter reaction.Conveniently, the acetanilide is mixed with a molar excess of the nitrile, e.g., 1.5 to 3 molar equivalents of nitrile per molar equivalent of acetanilide, and this mixture is added slowly to cooled concentrated sulfuric acid, e.g., at a temperature of about OOC. Alternatively, the nitrile and the acetamide can be added sequentially to the cooled sulfuric acid.After the addition the reaction mixture is stirred and allowed to warm to room temperature over a period of time, e.g., 2 hours. The product from the above processes may be separated from the reaction mixture by standard laboratory procedures. Conveniently, after addition of the mixture to water ice, the product can be separated by extraction with a suitable organic solvent, such as methylene chloride, toluene, or ethyl acetate. The organic layer can be washed with water or salt water and dried over a suitable dry agent, such as magnesium, sulfate, or calcium sulfate. The crude product can then be purified by recrystallization, chromatography, distillation or the like. An improved process for making the formamidomethyl acetanilides of the present invention involves reacting the corresponding N halomethyl acetanilide with an excess of formamide at an elevated temperature up to about 1000C for a short period of time, e.g., two hours. The product can be separated and purified as noted above. The N N alkyl amidomethyl acetanilides can be made by reacting the corresponding unsubstituted N amidomethyl acetanilide with a suitable alkylating agent in the presence of a base and a phase transfer catalyst. Suitable alkylating agents are alkyl sulfates, e.g., dimethylsulfate, haloalkyl alkyl ethers, halides of aliphatic and arylalkyl aromatic compounds, e.g., methyl iodide and benzyl bromide.Suitable bases are alkali metal hydroxides, e.g., sodium hydroxide and alkaline earth hydroxides.Suitable phase transfer catalysts are those that will form an ion pair with the cation of the phase transfer catalyst. Therefore, useful catalysts are those containing organic soluble cations such as those enumerated in U.S. Pat. No. 3,992,432, including ammonium, phosphonium and sulfonium salts. Exemplary phase transfer catalysts include quaternary ammonium salts, e.g., aryl or aralkyl trialkyl ammonium halide salts such as benzyl triethyl ammonium bromide or chloride. The reaction is conveniently run in an inert solvent. Suitable inert solvents include dichloromethane, benzene, chlorobenzene, tetrahydrofuran, dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethylformamide, toluene or diethyl ether. The unsubstituted acetanilide is conveniently mixed with a molar excess of the alkylating agent, e.g., 1.1 to 1.5 molar equivalent excess in a substantial molar excess of base, e.q., 5 to 10 molar equivalent excess. Conveniently, the base is added with stirring to a cooled mixture of the acetanilide, alkylating agent, catalyst and inert solvent. After the addition, the mixture is mixed for a period of time, e.g., 1 hour, conveniently at room temperature.The product cn be separated from the reaction mixture using standard laboratory procedures. An alternative method for making theN N alkylamidomethyl acetanilide compounds is disclosed in u.S. Pat. No. 3,769,301 which is incorporated herein by reference.

Other desirable results include increased density of the turf grass and darkening of the color of the turf grass. The compounds of the present invention can be used with adjuvants in liquid or solid form. The compositions are prepared by admixing the compounds with an adjuvant including diluents, extenders, carriers, and conditioning agents to provide compositions in the form of finely divided particulate solids, granules, pellets, solutions, dispersions, or emulsions. Thus, they can be used with an adjuvant, such as a finely divided solid, a liquid of organic origin, water, a wetting agent, a dispersing agent, an emulsifying agent, binder, carrier, or any suitable combination of these. The compounds of this invention can also be in the form of liquids and wettable powders. These preferably contain as a conditioning agent one or more surface active agents in amounts sufficient to render a given compound readily dispersible in water or in oil. The incorporation of a surface active agent into the compound can enhance its efficacy. By the term surface active agent it is understood that wetting agents, dispersing agents, suspending agents, and emulsifying agents are included therein. Anionic, cationic, and nonionic agents can be used. Preferred wetting agents are alkyl benzene and alkyl naphthalene sulfonates, sulfonated fatty alcohols, amines or acid amides, long chain acid esters of sodium isothionate, esters of sodium sulfosuccinate, sulfated or sulfonated fatty acid esters, petroleum sulfonates, sulfonated vegetable oils, ditertiary acetylenic glycols, polyoxyethylene derivatives of alkylphenols particularly isooctylphenol and nonylphenol and polyoxyethylene derivatives of the mono higher fatty acid esters of hexitol anhydrides e.g., sorbitan . Preferred dispersants are methyl cellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, sodium salts of lignin sulfonates, polymeric alkyl, naphthalene sulfonates, sodium naphthalene sulfonate, and the polymethylene bisnaphthalene sulfonate. Wettable powders or dispersable granules are water dispersible compositions containing one or more active ingredients, an inert solid extender, and one or more wetting and dispersing agents. The inert solid extenders are usually of mineral origin, such as the natural clays, diatomaceous earth, salts and synthetic minerals, derived from silica and the like.Examples of such extenders include kaolinites, attapulgite clay, salts and synthetic magnesium silicate.The wettable powder compositions of this invention usually contain from about 0.5 to 90 parts preferably from 5 to 50 parts of active ingredient, from about 0.25 to 25 parts preferably 1 to 15 parts of wetting agent, from about 0.25 to 25 parts preferably 1.0 to 15 parts of dispersant, and from 5 to about 95 parts preferably 5 to 50 parts of inert solid extender, all parts being by weight of the total composition. Where required, from about 0.2 to 2.00 parts of the solid inert extender can be replaced by a corrosion inhibitor or antifoaming agent or both. Aqueous suspensions or emulsions may be prepared by stirring an aqueous mixture of a waterinsoluble active ingredient and an emulsification agent until uniform and then homogenized or milled to give stable emulsion or suspension of very finelydivided particles. The resulting concentrated aqueous suspension is characterized by its extremely small particle size, so that when diluted and sprayed, coverage is very uniform. Suitable concentrations of these formulations contain from about 2.5 to 60 , preferably 35 to 50 by weight, of active ingredient, the upper limit being determined by the active ingredients. In another form of aqueous suspensions, a water immiscible component is encapsulated to form microencapsulated phase dispersed in an aqueous phase.In one embodiment, minute capsulates are formed by bringing together an aqueous phase containing a lignin sulfonate emulsifier and a water immiscible chemical and polymethylene polyphenylisocyante, dispersing the water immiscible phase in the aqueous phase followed by addition of a polyfunctional amine. The isocyanate and amine compounds react to form a solid urea shell wall around particles of the water immiscible chemical, thus forming microcapsules thereof. Generally, the concentration of the microencapsulated material will range from about 480 to 700 g l of total composition, preferably 480 to 600 g l. The microencapsulation process referred to here is described in more detail in U.S. Patent No. 4,280,833. Concentrates are usually solutions of the active ingredients in water immiscible or partially water immiscible solvents together with a surface active agent. Suitable solvents for the active ingredients of this invention include dimethylformide, dimethylsulfoxide, N methylpyrrolidone, hydrocarbons, and water immiscible ethers, esters, ketones, or aromatics. However, other high strength liquid concentrates may be formulated by dissolving the active ingredient in a solvent then diluting, e.g., with kerosene, to spray concentration. The concentration compositions herein generally contain from about 0.1 to 95 parts preferably 35 to 60 parts active ingredient, about 0.25 to 50 parts preferably 1 to 25 parts surface active agent, and where required, about 4 to 94 parts solvent, all parts being by weight based on the total weight of emulsifiable oil. Granules are physically stable particulate compositions comprising the active ingredients adhering to or distributed through a basic matrix of an inert, particulate extender. In order to aid leaching of the active ingredient from the particulate, a surface active agent, such as those listed hereinbefore, can be present in the composition. Natural clays, pyrophyllites, illite, gypsum, and vermiculite are examples of operable classes of particulate mineral extenders. The preferred extenders are the porous, absorptive, preformed particles, such as preformed and screened particulate attapulgite or heat expanded, particulate vermiculite, and the finely divided clays, such as kaolin clays, hydrated attapulgite, or bentonitic clays. These extenders are sprayed or blended with the active ingredient to form the herbicidal granules. Granular compositions useful in this invention may contain from about 0.1 to about 30 parts, preferably from about 0.5 to 10 parts by weight of active ingredient per 100 parts by weight of clay, and 0 to about 5 parts by weight of surface active agent per 100 parts by weight of particulate clay. The compounds can also be added together with other additaments, for example, other growth regulators, fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides, safeners and the like used as adjuvants or in combination with any of the above described adjuvants. Although this invention has been described with respect to specific embodiments, the details hereof are not to be construed as limitations, for it will be apparent that various equivalents, changes and modifications may be resorted to without departing from the spirit and scope thereof and it is understood that such equivalent embodiments are intended to be included within the scope of this invention.
