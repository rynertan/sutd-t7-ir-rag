# PROCESS OF ION IMPLANT MASKING IN CMOS MANUFACTURE AND RESULTANT STRUCTURE

## Abstract
A method of fabricating a CMOS device is provided for patterning the gates and protecting them during ion im plantation. A metal layer 20 is sandwiched between the gate material layer 18 and the photoresist layer 22 that is used as a pattern mask for the gate material during etching. The photoresist pattern 22 masks the metal as it is etched, and the metal pattern 20M masks the gate material as it is etched to form a gate pattern. The metal mask is left over the gates to serve as an ion implant stop mask. Two photoresist patterns are successively formed to cover the devices of one conductivity type while the opposite type device source and drain regions are implanted. Then, the metal mask may be easily stripped without causing damage.
