# SOLVENT FREE PROCESS FOR PREPARING LIQUID EPOXY RESINS

## Abstract
Liquid epoxy resins are produced in solvent free process by 1 coupling a dihydric phenol with an excess of an epihalohydrin in the presence of a suitable catalyst, 2 remov ing the excess epihalohydrin, 3 dehydrohalogenating the resultant solvent free halohydrin intermediate at an elevated temperature and 4 removing inorganic reaction product materials by water washing the resultant solvent free liquid epoxy resin at elevated temperature to obtain a liquid epoxy resin.
