# Copolymers of ethylene and unsaturated ester.

## Abstract
A random copolymer comprises ethylene units which preferably forms a polyethylene chain and 0.001 to 10 mol of ester units which are ethylenically α,β unsaturated acid esters represented by the formula I or II Production is by catalytic radical polymerisation of the monomers or by grafting the ester unit onto a polymer or copolymer of ethylene. The copolymer may be blended with other polymers, may be crosslinked, and is extruded into wire or cable coatings or molded into sheets, films, or laminates. The copolymer has excellent dielectric breakdown characteristics, such as electricity treeing or water treeing pro perty, and is useful as insulation for high voltage cables.
