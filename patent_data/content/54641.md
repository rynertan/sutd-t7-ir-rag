# Thermally compensated shadow mask.

## Abstract
In vacuum sputter cleaning and plating operations forming a patterned metallisation on a semiconductor wafer 12 , an alignment problem is due to the different thermal expansion of a molybdenum shadow mask 8 used and of the silicon wafer 12 . This problem is solved by anticipating this difference in thermal expansion and forming the apertures 10 in the mask 8 in a radially offset position with respect to the intended cleaning and deposition locations on the wafer 12 at room temperature. Maintaining the mask 8 and wafer 12 in a concentric position and raising them to the cleaning and deposition temperature, the differential expansion will bring the apertures 10 into perfect alignment with the intended deposition locations on the wafer 12 . Even if the mask 8 and wafer 12 are not maintained in a mutually concentric position, the mask s 8 offset pattern will reduce the average misalignment and the maximum misalignment over all apertures 10 and predeposited wafer structures.
