# Method and apparatus for lead frame and semiconductor device encapsulation.

## Abstract
A lead frame 40 for receiving a semiconductor device 120 to be encapsulated includes a thor oughfare 300 for med as a solid non perforated part of the strip in which the frame is formed. Apparatus and method for packaging the semiconductor device when secured to the lead frame com prises a mold in which the device and frame are accommo dated in the mold. Plastic in fluent form is supplied through a runner 265, 290 to the mold 190 containing the semi conductor devices 120 and the strip 20 . The mold 190 forms a cavity 280 about the semiconductor device 120 and the portion of its associated lead frame 40 adjacent to the semiconductor device 120 . The plastic is directed over the thoroughfare 300 into the cavities 280 adjacent to the thoroughfare 300 .
