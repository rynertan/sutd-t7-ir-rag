# Compressor bleed air control apparatus and methods.

## Abstract
A turbine engine accessory power unit has a compressor 18 provided with a bleed air control system in which a surge bleed valve 58 is proportionally and integrally controlled to maintain a constant minimum compressor bleed flow rate slightly above the compressor s surge flow rate. The system control parameter is automatically reset as a function of inter alia the position of the compressor s adjustable inlet guide vanes to ensure optimum control system performance throughout the air delivery range of the compressor.
