# Particulate compositions useful as plant growing media additives.

## Abstract
Superabsorbent gel compositions useful as plant grow ing media additives are prepared in particulate form by commin uting a partially hydrated 10 80 moisture gel mass in the presence of a finely divided flow aid, such as kaolin. The partial ly hydrated granules are more easily mixed with damp com post or other growing media, and lead to improved soil prop erties, especially aeration, because the process gives rise to fewer fines which would otherwise tend to glue soil particles together. Preferred gels in foam form and based on polyacryl amide acrylate are described.

## Description
PARTICULATE COMPOSITIONS USEFUL AS PLANTGROWING MEDIA ADDITIVES This invention relates to particulate compositions, especially water retentive particulate polymeric compositions, useful as plant growing media additives. Various forms of hydrogels superabsorbents have been tested as, or at least proposed for use as, growing media additives, often referred to as soil conditioners, hydromulches, and soil water retainers. Such additives can be used to improve the properties, such as water retention, of conventional plant growing media, for example soil, peat, sand, loam, compost and sawdust. Alternatively, they can be used in conjunction with aqueous plant nutrient solutions to provide water retention and root support. An extensive review of the relevant literature is given byR A I Azzam, in Commun. Soil Science and Plant Analysis, 11 8 , 767 834, 1980 .It has however been difficult to achieve the preparation of a product which has an adequately high degree of water uptake without adversely affecting soil properties such as aeration when the product is incorporated in soil to give it a higher water holding capacity. Moreover, we find that many of the available polymeric growing media additives do not hydrate readily without special precautions being taken, and moreover they contain clogging fines, require sieving, and can easily generate further fines on handling. By the invention we provide a particulate composition useful as a plant growing media additive, comprising partially hydrated water retentive gel particles rendered free flowing by the presence of a finely particulate flow agent. The invention further provides a process for the preparation of such a composition, in which process a partially hydrated mass of water retentive gel is subdivided into particles in the presence of a finely particulate flow agent. The gel particles are preferably rather coarse, ie at least 0.5 mm, preferably 1 mm or more typical particle size at 50 60 solids content ie with the partially hydrated gel containing 50 40 by weight water . The flow agent should be very much finer. Preferably the flow agent is hydrophilic, so that it does not hinder water uptake by the gel particles. Kaolin and fullers earth are particularly preferred flow agents, but many alternative materials, such as fine talc powder, bentonite, fine aluminosilicates generally, and cellulose powders, can be used. Preferably the flow agent is not affected by water contained in the gel, and preferably is non hygroscopic. The gel particles are preferably free of significant amounts of water soluble or swellable fines which could cause formation of a gluey product on further hydration or cause potential dust problems for users.For example, one desirable composition provided by the invention comprises no more than 3 by weight of gel particles finer than 0.5mm, and substantially no gel particles smaller than 0.25mm. Using the techniques described herein, polymer fines in the 60 100 micron range can be avoided entirely, thus avoiding the need for sieving. This can preferably be achieved, in carrying out the invention, by avoiding milling the gel particles in the dry state. Preferably, much if not all of the flow agent is adherent to the surface of the gel particles. Indeed, in the ideal situation the flow agent forms an at least substantially continuous coating on all of the gel particles. Preferably, however, there should be little or no excess of flow agent present, as this could lead to dusting problems. The optimum level of flow agent present will clearly depend on the particle size of the gel, which determines the total surface area of the gel. In general, at least about 3 , and preferably at least about 5 , by weight of the flow agent will be required. The amount of the flow agent required is unlikely to exceed about 20 by weight, and an optimum level will typically be about 10 .These percentages are expressed by weight of the partially hydrated gel product.Preferably the flow agent is added when the gel has a water content greater than about 16 , and more preferably greater than about 20 by weight, when it has a somewhat sticky surface, for example during comminution. For this purpose the water content of the gel should not exceed about 80 by weight, and need not in general exceed about 70 by weight, and an ideal level will generally lie in the range 30 to 60 by weight.The expression partially hydrated , as used in this specification in relation to the gel particles of the invention, implies water levels of roughly this order of magnitude, but it will be appreciated that different types of gels and flow agents may enable a partially hydrated yet suitably free flowing product to be made having a water content of greater than 70 by weight. To reduce the costs of handling and transport, preferably the partially hydrated product should not contain more water than is necessary to achieve the benefits of the invention in this respect. We find that such a product can be made with high water retentive capacity without substantially hindering soil aeration or other agriculturally significant soil properties eg gas exchange facility, friability, drainage and percolation properties, when the product is incorporated as a conditioning water holding agent.Indeed, it is an advantage of the partially hydrated product of the invention that it can significantly improve soil aeration under many circumstances, in contrast to many other forms of superabsorbent gel products previously tested for agricultural and horticultural purposes, which have tended to lead to rather water logged conditions. To be of value in agriculture horticulture as a water retentive additive, any gel product should be capable of absorbing releasably at least 5, and preferably at least 10, times its own weight of water. Not merely can the gel products of the invention achieve this, but we have been able to produce free flowing partially hydrated particulate gels capable of absorbing at least 15, generally at least 20, and often at least 25, times their dry weight of water without significantly interfering with essential soil properties. Indeed, some gel products of the invention are capable of releasably absorbing 100 times, or more, their dry weight of water. It will be appreciated that a typical partially hydrated product of the invention already contains about 40 by weight of water. It will also be appreciated that absorption figures for pure water may not be particularly significant, because the presence of even minute traces of ionised solutes can markedly affect the water absorbing properties of gel polymers Hence it is to be expected that any gel product will actually absorb substantially less of an aqueous plant nutrient solution, and so in practice their true absorbency is lower.However, in general, the gel products of the invention are capable of absorbing from 10 to 70 times their dry weight of typical aqueous plant nutrient solution. The manufacture of products of the invention can be relatively simple and convenient because a drying stage is not necessary the gels can often be made with a water content equivalent to that of the final products. Because their water content is at or near equilibrium, storage of the partially hydrated gel products of the invention is facilitated, and they do not generally require sophisticated packaging to protect them from atmospheric moisture. The products can be easily mixed with water or water containing material, such as damp compost, without specially vigorous mixing, as is often required with fully dehydrated materials. Even better aeration can often be achieved by products in which, as in a preferred embodiment, the partially hydrated gel composition has a foam structure preferably with a foam content equivalent to a volume increase of up to 100 or more, e.g. up to about 300 . The invention is not limited to any restricted class or classes of water absorbing and desorbing gel materials, and hence the invention can be beneficially applied to any of the superabsorbent gel types that have previously been used, or may be proposed for use, in an agricultural horticultural context. A wide variety of polymeric materials have been used to prepare superabsorbent gels, and these are reviewed, for example, in UK patent application No. 2,083,487A. Potentially, any hydrophylic water swellable polymeric material can be used, as long as it is at least substantially water insoluble. The polymer must have at least some ionic character to enable it to absorb sufficient quantities of water. Some degree of cross linking is generally essential to ensure low solubility.Examples of general classes of suitable polymers are polyacrylates, ie polymers and copolymers of acrylamide, acrylic acid, acrylic acid salts, acrylic esters and acrylonitrile polysaccharide graft copolymers, ie starches and celluloses combined with polyacrylate chains, for example gelatinised starch hydrolysed polyacrylonitrile graft copolymers and cross linked alkyl celluloses, such as carboxymethylcellulose cross linked with epichlorohydrin. Any monomer can contain non sterically hindering substituents, eg methyl. The gel product should have low deformability when fully hydrated, so that good soil aeration is maintained when it is added to or worked into soil and hydrated.Preferably the gel material is not significantly degradable, so that it retains its effect for a long time in a natural environment. One very suitable example of such a polymeric material is a copolymer of acrylamide and acrylic acid salt cross linked by inclusion of a minor proportion of a bifunctional cross linking agent, preferably N,N methylene bisacrylamide. In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the gel is a cross linked copolymer of acrylamide and acrylic acid salt, in a molar ratio of at least 70 30 but not greater than 95 5 Again, the preferred cross linking agent is N,N methylenebisacrylamide. Preferably the molar ratio of acrylamide to acrylic acid salt is at least 80 20 but preferably is not greater than 90 10. Methacrylates can be used. The polymerisation and cross linking conditions are preferably such as would in the absence of cross linking yield substantially water soluble high molecular weight polymer, but includes enough cross linking agent to reduce the amount of water soluble polymer which could lead to undesirable glue formation on hydration to tolerable low levels, preferably less than 30 by weight of the dry polymer of the particulate compositions ie less than about 20 of the partially hydrated product . The level of cross linking agent required will vary according to the types of monomers and cross linking agents used, but generally the level of cross linking agent will not need to be greater than 2 , and usually not greater than 1 , by weight of the total monomers. Usually the cross linking agent will be present in an amount of at least 0.01 by weight of the total monomers.For the preferred acrylamide acrylate copolymers used in the gel products of the invention, an ideal level of cross linking agent will generally lie in the range 0.02 to 0.28 by weight of the total monomers. Examples of suitable cross linking agents are ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, polyethylene glycol dimethacrylate, polyethylene glycol diacrylate, and most preferably 1,3,5 triacrylol hexahydro S triazine and N,N methylene bisacrylamide. Mixtures of two or more cross linking agents can be used if desired.The proportion of soluble material in the dry polymer can conveniently be regarded for present purposes as equal to the proportion by weight which becomes non sedimenting and ultrafiltrable after agitation of particulate uniformly ground through 1.5mm screen polymer in 1 NaCI solution at room temperature for 2R hours. This test can also be applied to the partially hydrated product, with the omission of the grinding step. It is preferred that the residual monomer in the polymer gel be not more than 1 , more preferably below 0.1 , most preferably below 0.05 . The special need for low monomer levels is due to the risk of toxicity to plants and users, and the levels which are acceptable can be checked according to the nature of the monomer with this need in mind. This can be achieved for example either by ensuring complete enough polymerisation, and or by heating the polymer to remove residual monomer, and or by solvent washing. For example, residual acrylamide monomer can be removed by heating in the range 90 C 150 C for a sufficient time. Preferably a monomer solution is polymerised by conventional W photoinitiation using any suitable initiator, such as a benzoin alkyl ether. The total monomer level will generally be at least about 20 , and preferably at least 25 , by weight of the solution.An upper limit will depend on the solubility of the monomers used and the viscosity of the solution, especially if a thin film process is being performed. For acrylic monomers a solution concentration of up to about 55 by weight are very suitable, and an ideal concentration will generally lie in the range 30 50 . The initiation level can be varied over wide limits, eg 0.001 to 1 of the monomer, but for benzoin methyl ether, for example, about 0.l of monomer weight is very suitable. Polymerisation conditions can be chosen to ensure autoacceleration by reaction heat to give short reaction times without causing excessive overheating. Acrylic acid monomer units can conveniently be present as the potassium, sodium or ammonium salt or the salt of any other acceptable convenient counterion. When acrylic acid is used as a monomer it can be partly e.g. 90t neutralised by alkali e.g. K2C03 before the polymerisation reaction. As mentioned above, according to a preferred feature of the invention, the polymer gel is in the form of a foam.Foaming can be produced for example by saturating the reactant solution with a dissolved gas, and ensuring that the polymerisation conditions such that the exothermic polymerisation reaction causes a temperature rise sufficient to drive the gas reaction mixture to boil, after the reaction mix has become viscous, but before gelling is complete. In this way a bubble containing polymer gel product is formed. As an example, a C02 effervescing system can be provided by saturating the reactant mix with a carbon dioxide, and or using a carbonate to neutralise a monomer such as acrylic acid. Foaming can be enhanced by the inclusion of a foaming agent eg emulsifier, detergent to the reactant mix prior to polymerisation, and this leads to particularly useful low density cellular gel structures in the final product.A very wide selection of foaming agents can be used, the only likely restrictions being that the agent should not render the reactant solution opaque to UV light, should not have armful effect on plants if it were to be leached from the gel during use, and relative cost although the level of foaming agent employed would in any event by very low . Preferably the quantity of foaming agent added to the reactant mix should be just sufficient to give the desired degree of foaming during the polymerisation, but this quantity will clearly vary from one agent to another.Very generally, it can be said that the quantity needed will lie in the range 0.01 to 0.1 gm litre of reactant solution. Examples of suitable foaming agent that we have found to be effective are soaps, such as sodium stearate, and emulsifiers, such as sodium stearoyl 2 lactylate.Examples of other commercially available foaming agents are hydrolysed proteins, such as Hyfoama DS Food IndustriesNV and glycerol esters, such as Emulsponge 2002 PPFInternational . Foamed products made in this way are especially advantageous in that they possess a two stage water holding capacity, by virtue of water taken into cells formed by the effervescence and water physically absorbed in the microporous polymer gel structure itself. They also can show increased water uptake rate, because of their greater surface to volume ratio. Particulate gel compositions according to embodiments of the invention can conveniently be made by dividing a partially hydrated water absorptive polymer gel mass, e.g.made as described above, using a knife mill, or other suitable comminution device which has a shearing cutting action at a relatively slow speed, eg about 500 r.p.m. A device having a rotary bladed scissors type shearing cutting action is preferred, and a good example is the Blackfriars TM cutter. The presence of a flow aid is important here to prevent cut gel pieces from adhering to each other and to the comminution device. As fines are to be avoided if possible, average particle sizes preferably are of the order of 0.5 to 5 mm, and preferably substantially no particles of gel are below 125 microns. The size of the particles is given as for the partially hydrated condition, as thewparticles generally increase in size on hydration.We find that this method of comminution of a partially hydrated material using a knife or cutting mill helps to avoid any need to sieve the gel product. According to the invention, the particulate gel compositions so produced can be added to soil to improve its water holding ability, or to give water retentive layers, mulches and packaging for use in horticulture and agriculture. It will be appreciated that the gel composition itself will not provide any nutrients to sustain plants, and it must therefore be regarded primarily as a moisture retentive and physically supportive material.When used in combination with an aqueous nutrient solution containing e.g. phosphates, nitrates, plant hormones and growth regulants and or one or more traditional plant growing media, such as peat, loam, compost or moss, the whole provides a very suitable material in which plants can germinate, root or grow. The gel compositions of the invention are particularly well suited for use in the potting or rooting of immature plants in a nursery prior to transfer to field or plantation conditions, and as such can be mixed in minor proportion with a rooting root holding medium such as wood fibre, peat, forest bark, straw, loam, or particulate plastics material. The proportion of gel product used can be varied according to the situation. When employed as a soil additive, levels of inclusion as low as 0.5 1 by weight of gel volume of growing medium assessed in terms of the partially hydrated gel product can lead to significant soil improvements. In this context generally only a few percent of the gel are required, and levels in excess of 4 by weight may not be considered economic. However, in a small scale potting or rooting procedure the gel can be used simply in conjunction with an aqueous nutrient solution and the gel therefore represents 100 of the solids present, although in this context it will generally be sensible on cost grounds to mix the gel with one or more cheaper supportive fillers such as sawdust, straw or sand. The invention is illustrated without limiting its scope, by the several features of the following Examples.Example 1 Preparation of a flowable particulate composition suitable for agricultural or horticultural use. Acrylic acid 950 g containing methylenebisacrylamide 10 g was neutralised either with potassium hydroxide 700 g or potassium carbonate 863 g as a solution in water 1250 ml . The temperature of the mixture was kept below 30 C during the neutralisation. Benzoin methyl ether 1.0 g was dissolved in acrylic acid 50 g and this solution was added to the mixture. The solution was shielded as much as possible from light. The whole was purged with nitrogen. The reactant mix was then pumped to give a film film thickness varied from 3 10 mm on a moving conveyor shaped by the action of folding cheeks and a suction box to give a trough shape configuration which contained the liquid reactants. The conveyor then carried the solution through a nitrogen filled cavity where it was irradiated with long wave length UV light 2 x 40 watt tubes peaking at 365 nm, giving 3200 W cm2 incident light intensity . The solution rapidly gelled to give a rubbery polymer. The irradiation time was typically in the range 6 9 minutes. The partially hydrated gel was minced in a continuous process in a Blackfriars TM cutter with the addition of at least 5 by weight fine particle size 40 60 pm kaolin, fuller s earth or bentonite, to give a chip product in which 97 of the particles had a particle size greater than 0.6mm and less than 2mm, and substantially no fines. The product had a moisture content about 40 by total weight, a bulk density of about 0.6g ml, and a proportion of soluble polymer by reference to the total dry polymer of 22 , when measured as described above. The product could be dried but should not be milled when dry, to avoid making fines. The product absorbed aboout 20 times its own weight of a conventional aqueous phosphate containing plant nutrient solution. The product was suitable for use in a mulch, as a soil additive or in a mixture with non soil components, eg straw or peat, for covering or enclosing plant root systems.Example 2 Foamed gel crumbs Acrylic acid 950g containing methylenebisacrylamide lOg was c. 90 mole neutralised by addition of potassium carbonate 862g as a solution in water 1200g .The temperature of the mixture during the neutralisation process was maintained at 200C or less. Benzoin methyl ether lg in acrylic acid 50g was added to the neutralised acrylic acid solution followed by a thermal initiator 2,2 azobis 2 amidinopropane hydrochloride lg as a solution in water 50g . The reactant mix was shielded as much as possible from light. The solution was poured into a glass dish to give a film thickness of between 5 and 7 mm and was irradiated by long wave length ultra violet light peak wavlength 365nm, incident light intensity 3200 W cm2 . Polymerisation was rapid and accompanied by a rapid temperature rise, the temperature reaching a maximum of approximately 115 C after 2 3 minutes. There was a sudden and large increase in the volume of the polymer, due both to the boiling point of the aqueous mixture being exceeded and to the release of carbon dioxide from solution. This resulted in a highly foamed rubbery polymer. The total irradiation time was 8 minutes. After cooling the foamed polymer was removed from the glass tray and comminuted in a Blackfriars TM cutter with the addition of at least 5 by weight fine particle size 40 60 um fuller s earth, kaolin or bentonite to give a crumb product where 97 of particles lay in the size range 0.6 2.0 mm and with substantially no fines. The moisture content of the product was 36 , the bulk density about 0.5g ml and the proportion of soluble polymer when measured as described above up to about 30 of the dry solids, or about 20 by weight of the partially hydrated product . The partially hydrated product was able to absorb about 17 times its own weight of a conventional aqueous phosphate containing plant nutrient solution.Example 3 Polyacrylamide copolymer Acrylic acid 48.7g containing benzoin methyl ether 0.24g was completely neutralised with potassium carbonate 47.3g as a solution in water 120 mls . To this mixture acrylamide 192g and N,N methylene bisacrylamide 0.24g , as a solution in water 240 mls , was added. The solution was shielded from light as much as possible and purged with nitrogen for 10 minutes. The reactant mix was poured into pyrex glass dishes so as to give a film thickness of approximately 7.5mum and irradiated with long wave length ultra violet light 2 x 40 watt tubes peaking at 365 nm giving an incident light intensity of 4000 pW cm2 . The solution rapidly gelled to a give a rubbery polymer accompanied by a rapid temperature rise, typically from 20 C to 100 C in 1h minutes. The total irradiation time was typically 5 10 minutes. The resulting material was not foamed. The rubbery polymer film was removed from the glass dishes and is comminuted in a Blackfriars tom cutter with the addition of at least 5 by weight fine particle size 40 60 um cutting aid such as fullers earth, kaolin or bentonite to give a chip product where 97 of particles lay in the range 0.6 2.0 mm and with substantially no fines. The moisture content of the product was about 43 , the bulk density about 0.7g ml and the proportion of soluble polymer when measured as described above was about 138 of the dry solids, or about 9 by weight of the partially hydrated product . The partially hydrated product could absorb about 27 times its own weight of a conventional aqueous phosphate containing plant nutrient solution.Example 4 To a solution of acrylamide 1800g in water 1950 mls was added potassium carbonate 195.5g in water 500 mls . To this mixture acrylic acid 204 g containing benzoin methyl ether 2 g and N,N methylene bisacrylamide 1 g is slowly added with stirring to complete the neutralisation reaction. The solution was shielded from light as much as possible and purged with nitrogen to flush out carbon dioxide from the carbonate neutralisation. The reactant mix was then pumped to give a film thickness of 5 9 mm on a moving conveyor shaped by the action of folding cheeks and a suction box to give a trough shape configuration which contained the liquid reactants.The conveyor carried the solution through a nitrogen filled cavity where it was irradiated with long wavelength UV light 2 x 40 watt tubes peaking at 365 nm, giving 3500 200 2 200 yW cm2 incident light intensity .Polymerisation was rapid and accompanied by a rapid temperature rise, reaching in excess of 100 C after 2 3 minutes. Some large bubbles were formed in the polymer film due to the boiling point of water being exceeded, but the material is not foamed. The total irradiation time was in excess of 20 minutes. The rubbery polymer film was cooled and comminuted on a Blackfriars TM cutter with the addition of 5 by weight of fine particle size cutting aid fullers earth .The moisture content of the product was 41 , the bulk density 0.6 g ml and the soluble fraction of the partially hydrated product was 6 equivalent to about 9 by weight of the dry polymer . The product absorbed about 20 times its own weight of a plant nutrient solution.Example 5 The procedure of Example 4 was repeated, using identical materials, quantities and reaction conditions, except that a dispersion of Emulsponge 2002 a commercially available foaming agent obtained from PPFInternational was added to the reactant mix and the nitrogen purging was omitted. The dispersion contained 1 g of foaming agent in 50 ml water. During the polymerisation reaction there was a sudden and large increase in the volume of the polymer, due both to the boiling of the aqueous mixture and to the release of carbon dioxide from solution. The formation of a foamed gel was greatly enhanced by the addition of the foaming agent. The foamed polymer film was cooled and comminuted on a Blackfriars TM cutter with the addition of 5 by weight of fine particle cutting aid kaolin . The moisture content of the product was 41 , the bulk density 0.5 g ml and the soluble fraction of the partially hydrated product was 7 equivalent to about 11 by weight of the dry polymer . The product absorbed about 25 times its own weight of a plant nutrient solution. All the products described in Examples 1 to 5, had a non powdery look and feel, and a friable, granular, although soft, texture to the touch, and were well compatible with soil and other plant growing media. Example 6 The partially hydrated gel product of Example 4 was used in plant growing trials as follows The gel product was used in conjunction with three separate growing media, sphagnum peat, coarse sand and good loam, each supplemented by a commercially available controlled release fertiliser. The trials were conducted in plastics plant pots each having a top diameter of 14 cm and a depth of 9 cm, packed with 600 cc of growing media.The gel product was included at levels of 0.5, 1.0 and 2.08 wt vol, and each growing media without any gel was used as a control. There were four pots of each combination, giving a total of 48 pots. Each pot contained 0.84 gm of the controlled release fertiliser Osmocote . The prepared pots were filled with water and drained for 24 hours prior to seed sowing. To ensure uniformity of plant material, Phaseolus vulgaris seeds of the cultivar PROVIDER were chitted and sown five to a pot. The plants were grown for the five weeks under glass until the formation of the first flower buds, at which time plant height, number of flowering nodes and dry weight of the aerial portion were recorded.Watering throughout the growing period was by means of capillary matting. The results are given in Table 1, and indicate that the addition of the gel induced increases in plant height and number of nodes, and statistically significant increases in dry weight, in all media.

The presence of gel product greatly reduced these losses, the numbers of surviving plants were 1, 9 and 12 respectively for the three treatments. The plants were then potted on into 2.5 litre polyethylene containers using the same compost mixture and gel treatments except that the gel was swollen by the addition of approximately 20 times its original weight of aqueous nutrient solution prior to mixing with the compost.Plant heights were recorded at 19 weeks after the original sowing date.Table 4 Average Plant heights at 19 weeks in cm Gel 0 0.5 1.0 2.0 Alnus 53 44.1 59.3Quercus 19 27.4 29.6 36.5Example 8Effect of incorporation of gel additives on growing media phase volumes The gel product of Example 4 was added to a growing medium as detailed in Table 5. The mixture was placed in a 10 cm diameter plant pot and placed on capillary matting saturated with a standard concentration of an aqueous plant nutrient solution. When the contents of the pot had reached equilibrium the phase volumes of the constituents air, water, solid were calculated using absolute densities obtained using a helium air pycnometer. The values are expressed as air solid and water solid ratios. Percentages of gel product added are weight volume, eg 1 represents lg additive in 100 mls medium.

Example 9Example 8 was repeated except that i the pots were covered tightly with polyethylene sheet to prevent moisture loss from the surface of the growing medium. ii the gel additive was swollen by addition of approximately 20 times its own weight of an aqueous plant nutrient.solution prior to mixing with the growing medium.
