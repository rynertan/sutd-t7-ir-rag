# Overload protection device.

## Abstract
The output of an amplifier for driving capacitative loads is protected from short circuits or other fault conditions without need for mechanical circuits interruptive devices. A voltage divider 68, 70 is disposed across a coupling capacitor 66 between the amplifier and its load. A transistor 72 responsive to voltage across part of the divider causes a transistor 82 to remove the input signal from the first stage 46 of the amplifier when the load current exceeds a predetermined limit.
