# Chemical process on the surface of a rotating body with subsequent discharge of the reaction product.

## Abstract
A process for carrying out a chemical reaction on a liquid capable of exhibiting the Weissenberg effect, comprising rotating a body having a surface of rotation coaxial with the axis of rotation, the surface of rotation extending from a supply zone to a discharge zone, being an external surface at least in the region of its supply zone and having its discharge zone at a position of maximum radius, dipping the rotating supply zone into the liquid thereby to cause the liquid to flow up over the surface by the Weissenberg effect until it reaches the discharge zone there to be flung from the position of maximum radius by centrifugal forces, and effecting the chemical reaction as the liquid flows over the rotating surface between the supply zone and the discharge zone.
