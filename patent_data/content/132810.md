## Description
TITLE BOROSILICATE GLASS COMPOSITIONSField of Invention The invention relates to borosilicate glass compositions which are especially useful as the binder component for thick film resistor compositions.Background of the Invention Thick film materials are mixtures of metal, metallic oxides, glass and or ceramic powders dispersed in an organic medium. These materials, which are applied to nonconductive substrates to form conductive, resistive or insulating films, are used in a wide variety of electronic and light electrical components. The properties of such thick film compositions depend on the specific constituents of the compositions. Most of sch thick film compositions contain three major components. A conductive phase determines the electrical properties and influences the mechanical properties of the final film. A binder, usually a glass and or crystalline oxide, holds the thick film together and bonds it to a substrate, and an organic medium vehicle acts as a dispersing agent and influences the application characteristics of the composition and particularly its rheology. High stability and low process sensitivity are critical requirements for thick film resistors in microcircuit applications. In particular, it is necessary that resistivity Rav of a resistor be stable over a wide range of temperature conditions.Thus, the thermal coefficient of resistance TCR is a critical variable in any thick film resistor.Because thick film resistor compositions are comprised of a functional conductive phase and a permanent binder phase, the properties of the conductive and binder phases and their interactions with each other and with the substrate affect both resistivity and TCR. Class is most frequently used as the inorganic binder for thick film resistors.Frequently used glass frits have been borosilicate frits, such as barium, calcium or other alkaline earth borosilicate frits. The preparation of such glass frits is well known and consists, for example, in melting together the constituents of the glass in the form of their oxides and pouring such molten composition into water to form the frit. The batch ingredients may, of course, be any compound that will yield the desired oxides under the usual conditions of frit production. For example, boric oxide will be obtained from boric acid silicon dioxide will be produced from flint barium oxide will be produced from barium carbonate etc. The glass is preferably milled in a ball mill with water to reduce the particle size of the frit and to obtain a frit of substantially uniform size. Despite the wide variety of glasses which have been used as the binder for thick film resistor materials, there remains a need for glass binder materials which 1 can be used to enhance either positive or negative TCR which 2 are nontoxic and 3 will also yield resistors which are stable after laser trimming.Summary of the Invention The invention is, therefore, directed in its primary aspect to a glass composition which is substantially free of Bi, Cd and Pb comprising by mole A. 50 85t of a material selected from the group consisting of 20 608 B203, 10 50 SiC2, 0 15 A1203, 0 5 SnO2, 0 10 ZrO2, 0 5 Nb205, 0 5 MoO3, 0 5t WO3 0 10 Tio2, 0 10 V2O5, 0 10 Ta2O5, 0 10 HfO2 and mixtures thereof and B. 50 15 of a material selected from the group consisting of 0 15 MgO, 0 208 CaO, 0 58 Cr2O3, 0 30 MnO, 0 5 Fe2O3, 0 15 CoO, 0 158 Nio, 0 5t CuO, 0 35 ZnO, 0 20 SrO, 10 35 BaO and 0 58 of a fluoride of a metal selected from the group consisting of alkali metals, alkaline earth metals and nickel and mixtures thereof, characterized further in that 1 the mole ratio B203 Sio2 0.8 2 B2O3 and SiO2 50 3 the mole ratio B203 Al2O3 0.8 4. S102 8n02 ZrO2 In a secondary aspect, the invention is directed to a screen printable thick film resistor composition comprising a dispersion in organic medium of an admixture of finely divided particles of electrically conductive material and the above described glass composition. In a still further aspect, the invention is directed to a resistor comprising a patterned thin layer of the above described dispersion, which has been dried and fired in a nonoxidizing atmosphere to effect volatilization of the organic medium and liquid phase sintering of the inorganic binder. In this Summary of the Invention as well as in the Detailed Description of the Invention which follows, all percentages are on a molar basis relative to the total glass composition unless otherwise indicated. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In the discussion which follows, all compositional percentages are mole unless otherwise stated. The glass composition of the invention is comprised basically of glass forming materials and glass modifying materials. By the term glass forming material is meant a material which upon melting and cooling will form a glass by itself without the addition of other materials. The termNglass forming material also includes conditional glass forming material which become part of the glass network. By conditional glass forming material is meant material which upon melting and cooling will form a glass only if other metal oxides are present.Despite the fact that the materials in Group A are characterized as glass formers211 this does not mean that they are necessarily functioning as glass formers in these glass compositions. The term refers only to their general characteristization in the art as being capable of glass formation under certain circumstances. Suitable glass forming materials and conditional glass formers are B2O3, SiC2, Al2O3, SnO2, ZrO2, Nb2O5, MoO3, WO3, TiC2, V205, Ta205 and HfO2. Of these, only B203 and SiO2 are essential to all compositions of the invention. The boron containing glass former must constitute at least 20 of the glass composition in order that the viscosity of the glass be suitable for application in thick film resistor systems. However, it must not exceed 60 and preferably not more than 55 lest the humidity stability of the resistor in which it is used be too low. Similarly, the silica component must be at least 10 of the glass in order that the glass has satisfactory durability and an appropriate coefficient of expansion for the particular ceramic substrate on which thick film resistor paste is used. Nevertheless, the amount of SiO2 should not exceed 50 . When higher amounts of SiO2 are used, the softening point of the glass may be elevated excessively and the TCR of the resultant resistor becomes too low. Other glass forming materials are not essential for all compositions of the invention however, A1203, SnO2, Zero2, Nb205, MoO3, 3, TiC2, V205, Ta205 and HfO2 can be used in addition to B203 and SiO2 to adjust the physical properties of the glass for particular applications. For example, A1203 can be used in limited quantities to raise softening point. However, if more than 15 is used, the softening point is elevated excessively. On the other hand, SnO2 is added to lower the resistance of the resistor system in which they are used. The amount of SnO2 used for this purpose is, however, limited by the comparatively low solubility of SnO2 in glass systems of the type described here. Similarly while small concentrations of ZrO2 may be quite desirable to adjust TCR and improve durability, the amount of ZrO2 which can be used is likewise limited because of its low solubility in this system. The transition metal glass formers or conditional glass formers must also be used within certain rather narrow limits as follows ZrO2 0 108, Nb205 0 5 , MoO3 0 5 , HfO2 0 10 , Ta205 0 10 and W03 0 5 . In addition to the above described limitations on the amount of each glasa former or conditional glass former which can be used, it is essential that the glass forming materials constitute 50 858 of the glass formulation. Also, the total amount of B203 and SiO2 must themselves constitute at least 50 of the glass composition and 60 708 is preferred. In addition, the mole ratio B203 SiO2 must be at least 0.8. Furthermore, the total content of glass formers in the composition must comply with the molar relationship, B2C3 A1203 0.8 4. sio2 Sino2 Zero, Within this ratio, small TCR values are obtained which are desirable from the standpoint of high reliability. Suitable glass modifying materials for use in the invention are oxides of a transition metals having atomic numbers of 24 28, Zn, alkaline earth metals having atomic numbers of 12 56, and fluorides of alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, nickel and mixtures thereof. The suitable glass modifiers which may be used in the invention are listed in Table I below, along with the allowable concentrations in which they can be used. The only glass modifier which is essential to all the compositions of the invention is BaO. It must constitute at least 10 of the glass in order to lower the softening point of the composition and to maintain the thermal expansion characteristics of the glass within appropriate limits. However, no more than 40 must be used lest both the coefficient of expansion and the stability of the glass be effected adversely. As used here in the term, glass stability refers to the characteristics of the glass to exist as a single solid phase substantially free of any second solid phase. Other glass modifiers may, of course, be included in the composition of the invention to lend particular physical or electrical properties to the glass. However, the maximum amount of each of these, which is set out in Table I below, must likewise be limited to avoid instability. TABLE 1 ALLOWABLE CONCENTRATIONS OF GLASS MODIFIERS ConcentrationModifier Composition Mole Oxides of Transition Metals,Atomic Nos. 24 28 Cr 0 5 Mn 0 5 Pe 0 10 Co 0 40 Ni 0 40Zinc Oxide 0 35Oxides of Alkaline Earth Metals Croup IIA with Atomic Nos. 12 56 Mg 0 20 Ca 0 40 Sr 0 40 Ba 10 40Fluorides of Alkali Metals, 0 10Alkaline Earth Metals,Nickel and Mixtures Thereof Equally important as the concentration of the individual glass modifiers is the total concentration of all glass modifiers which must be within the range of 15 50 and preferably 25 35 . It will be recognized that the glass compositions of the invention must not contain any materials which are reducible under the nonoxidizing conditions encountered in the use of these glasses in thick film resistor compositions. For this reason, reducible oxides such as Bi203, CdC and PbO must not be present in the composition in any significant amount that is, they may be present in only very small amounts since the reduced materials therefrom adversely effect the stability of the glass. In addition, the exclusion of these compounds also eliminates any the toxicity which might arise from the presence in the glass of oxides of Pb, Bi and Cd. It is preferred to employ at least about 5 transition metal oxides in the composition of the invention for the reason that those materials tend to catalyze the decomposition by pyrolysis of the organic medium of the thick film resistor compositions in which these glasses are used. Such transition metal oxides also reduce or eliminate staining of the conductive metal layer and substrate during pyrolysis of the organic medium. This is especially true for SnO SnO2 Ta205 resistor materials. In addition, certain transition metal oxides can be used to color the glasses of the invention e.g., Ni lends a gray color and Co a blue color. A yellow color is given by Fe and Mn, and Cr produces a green color. Most of the above described glass compositions, when used in conventional nitrogen fireable thick film resistor systems, help produce resistors having a desirably low TCR.However, the oxides of Fe and Mn, when used as glass modifiers as in the invention, tend to produce resistors having quite negative TCR values. Thus the glass composition of the invention can be used to modify resistor TCR values either upward or downward. In addition, mixtures of these glasses can be used to obtain intermediate TCR values. When the glass compositions of the invention are used as the binder component for conventional thick film resistor pastes, it is particularly preferred that the binder be comprised of 95 99.9 by weight of the above described bismuth , cadmium and lead free glass and 5 0.18 wt. of a metal fluoride selected from the group consisting of CaF2, BaF2, MgF2, SrF2, NaF, LiF, KF and NiF2. The use of such metal fluorides with the frit produces a decrease in resistance of the resistors made therefrom. The glasses of this invention are prepared with conventional glassmaking techniques by mixing the desired components in the desired proportions and heating the mixture to form a melt. As is well known in the art, heating is conducted to a peak temperature and for a time such that the melt becomes entirely liquid and homogeneous. In the present work, the components were premixed by shaking in a polyethylene jar with plastic balls and then melted in a platinum crucible at the desired temperature.The melt was heated at a peak temperature of 1100 1400tC for a period of 1 1 2 hours and then poured into cold water. The maximum temperature of the water during quenching was kept low by increasing the water to melt volumetric ratio. After separation from water, the crude frit is freed from residual water by drying in air or by displacing the water by rinsing with methanol. The crude frit is then ball milled for 3 15 hours in alumina containers using alumina balls. Residual alumina picked up by the materials, if any, is not within the observable limit as measured by x ray diffraction analysis. After discharging the milled frit slurry from the mill, excess solvent is removed by decantation and the frit powder is air dried at room temperature. The dried powder is then screened through a 325 mesh screen to remove any large particles. When the glass frits of the invention are used as the binder component of thick film resistor compositions, an important property of the frit is to aid the liquid phase sintering of the inorganic crystalline particulate materials and form noncrystalline amorphous or crystalline materials by devitrification during the heating cooling cycle firing cycle in the preparation of such thick film resistors. This devitrification process can yield either a single crystalline phase having the same composition as the precursor noncrystalline glassy material or multiple crystalline phases with different compositions from that of the precursor glassy material. The glass compositions of the invention have been found to be particularly effective in the SnO SnC2 Ta2C5 Nb205 pyrochlore based resistors described in applicant s U.s. PatentApplication 8.N. 460,572, filed January 24, 1983.Resistor Materials One of the most important uses for the glasses of the invention is as inorganic binder for thick film resistors. The conductive phase for thick film resistors usually consists of noble metal oxides such as RuO2 and noble metal polyoxides such as ruthenium, iridium or osmium pyrochlores. However, various base metal materials have been used as well, including metal hexaborides, molybdenum based compounds, silicides, doped tin oxides, SnO2 Ta2 05 based materials and especially the SnO 5no2 Ta2o5 Nb2o pyrochlore baved resistors referred to hereinabove. The use of the glass compositions of the invention with ruthenium, iridium and osmium and pyrochlores is not recommended.However, the use of these glasses with the other types of resistors listed above is not only recommended but is a preferred application for the composition of the invention.Organic Medium The main purpose of the organic medium is to serve as a vehicle for dispersion of the finely divided solids of the composition in such form that it can readily be applied to a ceramic or other substrate. Thus, the organic medium must first of all be one in which the solids are dispersible with an adequate degree of stability. Secondly, the rheological properties of the organic medium must be such that they lend good application properties to the dispersion. Most thick film compositions are applied to a substrate by means of screen printing. Therefore, they must have appropriate viscosity so that they can be passed through the screen readily. In addition, they should be thixotropic in order that they set up rapidly after being screened, thereby giving good resolution. While the rheological properties are of primary importance, the organic medium is preferably formulated also to give appropriate wetability of the solids and the substrate, good drying rate, dried film strength sufficient to withstand rough handling and good firing properties. Satisfactory appearance of the fired composition is also important. In view of all these criteria, a wide variety of inert liquids can be used as organic medium. The organic medium for most thick film compositions is typically a solution of resin in a solvent and, frequently, a solvent solution containing both resin and thixotropic agent. The solvent usually boils within the range of 130 350 C. By far, the most frequently used resin for this purpose is ethyl cellulose. However, resins such as ethylhydroxyethyl cellulose, wood rosin, mixtures of ethyl cellulose and phenolic resins, polymethacrylates of lower alcohols and monobutyl ether of ethylene glycol monoacetate can also be used. The most widely used solvents for thick film applications are terpenes such as alpha or beta terpineol or mixtures thereof with other solvents such as kerosene, dibutylphthalate, butyl carbitol, butyl carbitol acetate, hexylene glycol and high boiling alcohols and alcohol esters. Various combinations of these and other solvents are formulated to obtain the desired viscosity and volatility requirements for each application. Among the thixotropic agents which are commonly used are hydrogenated caster oil and derivatives thereof and ethyl cellulose. It is, of course, not always necessary to incorporate a thixotropic agent since the solvent resin properties coupled with the shear thinning inherent in any suspension may alone be suitable in this regard. The ratio of organic medium to solids in the dispersions can vary considerably and depends upon the manner in which the dispersion is to be applied and the kind of organic medium used. Normally, to achieve good coverage, the dispersions will contain complementally by weight 60 908 solids and 40 10 organic medium. Such dispersions are usually of semifluid consistency and are referred to commonly as pastes . The pastes are conveniently prepared on a three roll mill. The viscosity of the pastes is typically within the following ranges when measured at room temperature on Brookfield viscometers at low, moderate and high shear rates Shear Rate Sec Viscosity Pa.S 0.2 100 5000 300 2000 Preferred 600 1500 Most preferred 4 40 400 100 250 Preferred 140 200 Most preferred 384 7 40 10 25 Preferred 12 18 Most preferredThe amount and type of organic medium vehicle utilized is determined mainly by the final desired formulation viscosity and print thickness.Formulation and Application In the preparation of the composition of the present invention, the particulate inorganic solids are mixed with the organic medium and dispersed with suitable equipment, such as a three roll mill, to form a suspension, resulting in a composition for which the viscosity will be in the range of about l 100 150 Pa.S at a shear rate of 4 sec In the examples which follow, the formulation was carried out in the following manner. The ingredients of the paste, minus about 5 wt. of the estimated organic components which will be required, are weighed together in a container.The components are then vigorously mixed to form a uniform blend then the blend is passed through dispersing equipment such as a three roll mill to achieve a good dispersion of particles. A Hegman gauge is used to determine the state of dispersion of the particles in the paste. This instrument consists of a channel in a block of steel that is 25 ijm deep 1 mil on one end and ramps up to zero depth at the other end. A blade is used to draw down paste along the length of the channel. Scratches will appear in the channel where the agglomerates diameter is greater than the channel depth. A satisfactory dispersion will give a fourth scratch point of 10 18 pm typically. The point at which half of the channel is uncovered with a well dispersed paste is between 3 and 8 pm typically.Fourth scratch measurement of 20 pm and half channel measurements of 10 ijm indicate a poorly dispersed suspension. The remaining 5 of the organic components of the paste is then added and the resin content of the paste is adjusted for proper screen printing rheology. The composition is then applied to a substrate such as alumina, usually by the process of screen printing, to a wet thickness of about 30 80 microns, preferably 35 70 microns and most preferably 40 50 microns. The electrode compositions of this invention can be printed onto the substrates either by using an automatic printer or a hand printer in the conventional manner. Preferably, automatic screen printing techniques are employed using a 200to 325 mesh screen. The printed pattern is then dried at below 2000C, e.g., about 1500C, for about 5 15 minutes before firing.Firing to effect sintering of both the inorganic binder and the finely divided particles of metal is preferably done in a controlled atmosphere belt conveyor furnace with a temperature profile that will allow burnout of the organic matter at about 300 600 C, a period of maximum temperature of about 800 9500C lasting about 5 15 minutes, followed by a controlled cooldown cycle to prevent over sintering, unwanted chemical reactions at intermediate temperatures or substrate fracture which can occur from too rapid cooldown. By controlled atmosphere is meant a nonoxidizing atmosphere such as nitrogen, argon or mixtures thereof. The overall firing procedure will preferably extend over a period of about 1 hour, with 20 25 minutes to reach the firing temperature, about 10 minutes at the firing temperature and about 20 25 minutes in cooldown.In some instances, total cycle times as short as 30 minutes can be used.Sample Preparation Samples to be tested for temperature coefficient of resistance TCR are prepared as follows A pattern of the resistor formulation to be tested is screen printed upon each of ten codedAlsimag 614 1 x 1 ceramic substrates and allowed to equilibrate at room temperature and then dried at 1500C. The mean thickness of each set of ten dried films before firing must be 22 28 microns as measured by a Brush Surfanalyzer. The dried and printed substrate is then fired for about 60 minutes using a cycle of heating at 350C per minute to 8500C, dwell at 850 C for 9 to 10 minutes and cooled at a rate of 300C per minute to ambient temperature.Resistance Measurement and Calculations Substrates prepared as described above are mounted on terminal posts within a controlled temperature chamber and electrically connected to a digital ohm meter. The temperature in the chamber is adjusted to 250C and allowed to equilibrate, after which the resistance of each substrate is measured and recorded. The temperature of the chamber is then raised to 1250C and allowed to equilibrate, after which the resistance of the substrate is again measured and recorded. The temperature of the chamber is then cooled to 550C and allowed to equilibrate and the cold resistance measured and recorded. The hot and cold temperature coefficients of resistance TCR are calculated as follows Hot TCR R1250C R25CC x 10,000 ppm C R250CCold TCR RSS C R250C x 12,500 ppm C R25 C The values of R250C and Hot and Cold TCR are averaged and R25C values are normalized to 25 microns dry printed thickness and resistivity is reported as ohms per square at 25 microns dry print thickness.Normalization of the multiple test values is calculated with the following relationship Average Measured x Average Dry PrintNormalized Resistance Thickness, micronsResistance 25 micronsCoefficient of Variance She coefficient of variance CV is a function of the average and individual resistances for the resistors tested and is represented by the relationship o Rav, whereinEMI16.1 Ri measured resistance of individual sample.

A discussion can be found in Thick Film Hybrid Microcircuit Technology byD. W. Hamer and J. V. Biggers Wiley 1972 , p.173ff. Its use can be understood by considering that the resistance of a particular resistor printed with the same resistive ink on a group of substrates has aGaussian like distribution. To make all the resistors have the same design value for proper circuit performance, a laser is used to trim resistances up by removing vaporizing a small portion of the resistor material. The stability of the trimmed resistor is then a measure of the fractional change drift in resistance that occurs after laser trimming. Low resistance drift high stability is necessary so that the resistance remains close to its design value for proper circuit performance. The change in resistance is indicated by lav 1 and the standard deviation of each set of measurements by the term S . EXAMPLES In the examples which follow, the glass frit compositions listed in Table II below were made by the above described procedure. All were single phase glasses with no secondary phases present. Each of the below listed lessee was formulated into screen printable compositions with 55 conductive material, 19 glass and 26 organic medium. The same conventional organic medium was used in all formulations. However, the screen printable composition of Example 21 also contained 0.2 CaP2. The conductive material in each of the examples was prepared as follows A tantalum tin pyrochlore composition corresponding to the formula 2 1.75 1.75 0.25 6.625 was prepared by ball milling 71.42 g of SnO, 117.16 g of Ta205 and 11.42 g of SnO2 using water as a dispersing medium. Upon completion of thorough mixing, the admixtures were dried and placed in alumina crucibles and heated in a furnace containing a nonoxidizing N2 atmosphere.The mixtures were then heated for 24 hours at 8720C 100C to form the pyrochlore. The preparation and use of such pyrochlores is described in applicant s copendingU.S. Patent Application S.N. 460,572, filed January 24, 1983. The above described pyrochlore was then divided into 100 g quantities, each of which was combined with 400 g of purified SnO2 and ball milled for one hour using distilled water as a liquid milling medium. Upon completion of ball mill mixing, the mixtures of pyrochlore and Sn02 were placed in a nitrogen furnace and fired for 25 hours at 875µC. After firing and cooling, the powders were screened through a 200 400 mesh stainless steel screen.

Moreover, the linear coefficient of expansion alpha is compatible with that of alumina.Some of the glasses have a higher alpha than alumina. However, because compatibility with the substrate is a function of both the glass and the conductive phase material, they can still be used on alumina substrates when they are combined with conductive materials, such as Sino2, which have a low alpha value. The alpha value of SnO2 is only about 4 ppm C. The high Td, compared to lead borosilicate glasses, allows more of the carbonaceous material to burn off from the thick film composition before some of it becomes sealed in by the glass. Another attribute of these glasses is that they are short glasses i.e., they have a steep decrease in viscosity above Td. This property allows a good densification of the composite structure. In addition, lower firing temperatures on the order of 800 9000C are possible using such short glasses. By comparison, the glasses used with the SnC2 based conductive materials of Canadian Patent 1063796 require about 10000C for resistor formation. The data on the properties of the pyrcohlore based resistors made with the glasses of the invention reflect the role of the glass modifiers as well as the minor ingredients SnO2 and ZrO2 on the electrical properties. For example,SnO2 containing glasses Examples XII, XIII and XX lower the resistance while the combination of SnO2 and ZrO2 Examples XII and XIII both lower resistance and raise HTCR. On the other hand, glasses cntaining ZrO2 without sino2 increase both resistance and HTCR Examples VII, X and XIX . The data also show that glasses containingFe2O3, ZnO and TiO2 increase resistance and lower TCR Examples II VI and VIII . In fact, suchFe2O3 containing glasses can be used to produce thermistors Example IV . In addition to the various colors of the resistors produced from MnO, CoO, Nio andCuO containing glasses, these glasss also give a range of resistors all having desirably positive HTCR values. From these data, it is evident that the glass compositions of the invention can be used quite effectively over a wide range to change the TCR characteristics of resistor compositions in which they are used as binders. A series of three thick film resistor compositions was prepared by the procedure outlined hereinabove using glasses XI, XIX, XX and XXII as the inorganic binder component. Each of the resistors was evaluated with respect to post laser trim stability. These data are given in Table 3 below TABLE 3POST LASER TRIM STABILITY OF RESISTORSComposition wt.
