# Catalytic dewaxing hydrotreating process.

## Abstract
Process for catalytic dewaxing hydrotreating of hydro carbon feed materials comprising contacting the feed with hydrogen under catalytic dewaxing hydrotreating conditions in the presence of a catalyst comprising a shape selective zeolitic cracking component and a hydrogenating compo nent of improved thermal stability comprising a chromium component, at least one other Group VIB metal component and at least one Group VIII metal component. According to a specific aspect of the invention, the catalytic dewaxing hydrotreating process is employed to convert hydrocarbon feeds of either high or low quality to lube oil base stocks of high viscosity index, low pour point and good stability in a single step.
