# Device for positioning an electric cord and mounting a plug at an end thereof.

## Abstract
Method of manufacturing a cord set having at least two and preferably three insulated conductors, in which one of the insulated conductors, preferably the earth conductor, comprises auxiliary means having a deviating magnetic permeability, the cord is then introduced into a magnetic detector in which the position of the earth conductor is determined and finally the cord in the fixed position is provided with a plug in the usual manner, as well as the resulting cord set and a device for carrying out the method.
