# A METHOD FOR IMPROVING THE COMBUSTION OF FUELS AND FUEL COMPOSITIONS OBTAINED

## Abstract
Disclosure is made of a method of improving the com bustion of base fuels selected from ammonia, petroleum dis tillates, alcohols and amines. The method comprises the addi tion of hydrogen carriers to the base fuels, which possess an energy content and release it together with hydrogen for combustion upon ignition of the base fuel. The disclosure is also of novel fuel compositions which comprise from 0.5 to 15 percent by weight of a hydrogen carrier dissolved or sus pended in the base fuel.
