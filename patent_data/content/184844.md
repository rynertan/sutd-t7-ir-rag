The inner salts are preferred. Again, the compounds of Formula I include the stereoisomers as mixtures and as separate isomers. The compounds of the present invention I are valuable antibiotics active against variousGram positive and Gram negative bacteria and accordingly find utility in human and veterinary medicine. Representative pathogens which are sensitive to antibiotics I include Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella Pneumoniae,Bacillus subtilis, Salmonella typhotsa, Pseudomonas and Bacterium proteus. The antibacterials of the invention are not limited to utility as medicaments they may be used in all manner of industry, for example additives to animal feed, preservation of food, disinfectants, and in other industrial systems where control of bacterial growth is desired.For example, they may be employed in aqueous compositions in concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 100 parts of antibiotic per million parts of solution in order to destroy or inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria on medical and dental equipment and as bactericides in industrial applications, for example in waterbased paints and in the white water of paper mills to inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria. The compounds of this invention may be used in any of a variety of pharmaceutical preparations.They may be employed in capsule, powder form, in liquid solution, or in suspension. They may be administered by a variety of means those of principal interest include topically or parenterally by injection intravenously or intramuscularly . Compositions for injection, a preferred route of delivery, may be prepared in unit dosage form in ampules, or in multidose containers. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions, or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for reconstitution, at the time of delivery, with a suitable vehicle, such as sterile water. Topical applications may be formulated in hydrophobic or hydrophilic bases as ointments, creams, lotions, paints, or powders. The dosage to be administered depends to a large extent upon the condition and size of the subject being treated as well as the route and frequency of administration the parenteral route by injection being preferred for generalized infections. Such matters, however, are left to the routine discretion of the therapist according to principles of treatment well known in the antibiotic art. In general, a daily dosage consists of from about 5 to about 600 mg of active ingredient per kg of body weight of the subject in one or more treatments per day. A preferred daily dosage for adult humans lies in the range of from about 10 to 240 mg of active ingredient per kg of body weight.Another factor influencing the precise dosage regimen, apart from the nature of the infection and peculiar identity of the individual being treated, is the molecular weight of the chosen species of this invention I . The compositions for human delivery per unit dosage, whether liquid or solid, may contain from 0.1 to 998 of active material, the preferred range being from about 10 60 . The composition will generally contain from about 15 mg to about 1500 mg of the active ingredient however, in general, it is preferable to employ a dosage amount in the range of from about 250 mg to 1000 mg. In parenteral administration, the unit dosage is usually the pure compound I in sterile water solution or in the form of a soluble powder intended for solution. The preferred method of administration of the formula I antibiotic is parenteral by i.v.infusion, i.v. bolus, or i.m. injection. For adults, 5 50 mg of Formula I antibiotic per kg of body weight given 2, 3, or 4 times per day is preferred. Preferred dosage is 250 mg to 1000 mg of the Formula I antibiotic given two b.i.d. three t.i.d. or four q.i.d. times per day. More specifically, for mild infections, and particularly urinary tract infections, a dose of 250 mg t.i.d. or q.i.d. is recommended. For moderate infections against highly susceptible gram positive and gram negative organisms, a dose of 500 mg t.i.d. or q.i.d.is recommended. For severe, life threatening infections against organisms at the upper limits of sensitivity to the antibiotic, a dose of 1000 t.i.d.or q.i.d. is recommended. For children, a dose of 5 25 mg kg of body weight given 2, 3, or 4 times per day is preferred a dose of 10 mg kg t.i.d. or q.i.d. is usually recommended. Antibiotic compounds of Formula I are of the broad class known as carbapenems or l carbadethiapenems. Certain of these carbapenems are susceptible to attack by a renal enzyme known as dehydropeptidase DHP . This attack or degradation may reduce the efficacy of the carbapenem antibiotic.Inhibitors of DHP and their use with carbapenem antibiotics are disclosed in the prior art see published European Patent Applications No. 79102616.4 filed July 24, 1979 Patent Number 10573 79102615.6, filed July 24, 1979 application no.15573 and No. 82107174.3, filed August 9, 1980 application no. 72014 i. The present I compounds may, where DRP inhibition is desired or necessary, be combined or used with the appropriate DHP inhibitor as described in the aforesaid published applications. Thus, to the extent that the cited European patent applications 1. define the procedure for determining DHP susceptibility of the present carbapenems and 2. disclose suitable inhibitors, combination compositions and methods of treatment, they are incorporated herein by reference. A preferred weight ratio of I compound DHP inhibitor in the combination compositions is about 1 1. A preferred DHP inhibitor is 7 L 2 amino 2 carboxyethylthio 2 2,2 dimethyl cyclopropanecarboxamide 2 heptenoic acid or a useful salt thereof. These combination compositions and their use is another embodiment of the present invention. The compounds of Formula I may be prepared by any convenient process. Preparation of Compounds of Formula I Due to the varied nature of R4 and R5, several different synthetic approaches are used to prepare compounds of type I. These are summarized below. Implicit in these synthetic routes is the fact that when R5 contains a functional group which might interfere with the intended course of the reaction, the offending group is blocked. For example, when a basic nitrogen group is present as NHR or NH2, it is usually protected by acylation CO2 allyl or CO2PNB or silylation. In the case of a carboxyl group, protection is achieved via use of a suitable ester, such as allyl or PNB. In many instances, the actual order of carrying out the individual synthetic transformations in a synthetic scheme can be permuted for reasons ofSynthetic expediency. Thus, many of th examples listed below could proceed with equal facility by having the order of operations changed. Synthetic MethodologyA.
