# Dynamic bipolar integrated memory device.

## Abstract
This describes a sense latch for a bipolar dynamic array in which each cell is comprised of a capacitor CS and a pnp npn transistor. Cell information is stored in the capacitor CS . The capacitor may be either a discreet capacitor or may be formed as part of the base node of the pnp transistor. The sense latch 12 of the invention comprises a pair of cross coupled transis tors 40,41 coupled between a pair of capacitively loaded bit lines 10, 11 of the array with one of the bit lines 10, 11 being coupled to a data cell 15, 16 and the other being coupled to a reference cell 13, 14 . Means for precharging the bit lines 10, 11 to a fixed voltage level and means for reading the cell to charge one of the bit lines to a level greater than the precharge level and apply a differential signal to the latch 12 are also provided so that during the reading cycle one of the transistors 40,41 in the latch becomes turned on so that the voltage levels of both bit lines 10, 11 are determined by the characteristics of the turned on transistor 40,41 only. The voltage on one line is determined by the forward base emitter characteristics of the turned on transistor and the voltage on the other line is determined by the saturated collector emitter characteristics of the same turned on transistor.
