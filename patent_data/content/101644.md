# VARIABLE SWEEP FORWARD WING AIRCRAFT

## Abstract
Each half wing 2 of a variable sweepforward wing air craft is pivotally supported at its root part on the fuselage 1 and is adjustably set and locked at a sweep angle ranging from a small sweepback angle to a relatively large sweepforward angle. The setting and locking can be carried out automatically in response to the flight speed or, alternatively, directly by the pilot observing the speed indicator 14 . In the case of a super sonic speed aircraft, the wing is set in the vicinity of zero sweepforward angle at subsonic speed flight and at a large sweepforward angle at supersonic speed flight thereby to counter the rearward shifting of the aerodynamic center ac companying transition from subsonic speed to supersonic speed and thereby to reduce trim drag.
