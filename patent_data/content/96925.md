# INSULATED SPACE

## Abstract
An insulated space comprising upwardly extending walls built up from prefabricated wall elements consisting of two profiled metal plates between which insulating material is sandwiched and which are interconnected on their proximal side edges with the aid of coupling plates, whilst the space be tween the coupling plates and the proximal ends of the wall elements is filled with insulating material introduced into the space after the erection of the wall elements, whereby the pro filed metal plates are glued to plate shaped insulating material located between the profiled metal plates so that parts of the wave shaped plates projecting beyond the insulating material are formed by the wave tops formed by flat plate parts and by adjoining parts of the profiled metal plates connecting the wave tops with the wave valleys engaging the insulating mate rial whilst the proximal ends of the wall elements are intercon nected with the aid of the flat coupling plates engaging the wave tops and being fastened to the wave tops concerned.
