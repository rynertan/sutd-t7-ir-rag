# Regeneration of supported nickel catalysts.

## Abstract
This invention describes a method of regenerating the activity of deactivated supported nickel catalysts that have lost activity after use as a hydrogenation catalyst in the finishing stage of the process of conversion of butynediol to butanediol. The method comprises contacting said deacti vated catalyst with hydrogen at a temperature of about 200 to 500 C, to convert surface polymers to gaseous com pounds and removing said gaseous compounds from the vicinity of the thus treated catalyst. In the preferred form of the invention, in a single step, a slow stream of hydrogen is passed through the deactivated catalyst in situ as a fixed bed and the gaseous compounds are removed simultaneously in the hydrogen stream.
