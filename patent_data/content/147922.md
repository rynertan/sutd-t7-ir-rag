## Description
BALLAST CIRCUITS FOR LIGHTING UNITSOur US Patent 4 350 930 Piel discloses an improved lighting unit having a gas discharge tube as the main light source and an incandescent filament as a supplementary light source.The gas discharge tube has various modes of operation such as, 1 an initial high voltage breakdown mode, 2 a glow te arc transition mode, and 3 a steady state run mode. One of the circuit performance parameters is that the voltage applied across the gas discharge tube be such that the current flowing within the gas discharge tube is maintained above a critical value such as 6Q milliamps. If the current flowing in the gas discharge tube drops below this critical value the arc condition of the gas discharge tube may extinguish, which, in turn, may cause the gas discharge tube to revert from its steady state run mode to its glow to arc transition mode or even to the initial breakdown mode.The reestablishment of the desired arc condition of the gas discharge tube may require a restrike voltage having a value typically 2.5 times or more than that of the operating voltage of the gas discharge tube.The restrike voltage necessary for a gas discharge tube of 2.5 times its operational voltage presents a difficulty for a ballast circuit for a discharge tube operating directly from a 120 volt, 60 Hz AC source. For example, if the gas discharge tube has an operating voltage of 80 volts AC a restrike voltage of 80 x 2.5 200 volts or more is typically necessary and which voltage value is not ordinarily available from the peak voltages of a typical 120 volt, 60 Hz AC source. The gas discharge tube may be successfully operated by a ballast circuit developing a DC operating voltage.Such ballast circuits are described, for example, in the previously mentioned US Patent 4 350 930, and in ourUS Patent 4 320 325 T E Anderson . Further circuits are described in our pending US Applications 463 753 V Robert and 1188 849 J Davenport The gas discharge tube may also be successfully operated by a ballast circuit powered from an AC voltage source and developing an AC operating voltage. Such a ballast circuit is described, for example, in our pending USApplication 1188 833 J Davenport et al . Although all of the above mentioned ballast circuits will serve their desired function, it would be an advantage to provide a ballast circuit capable of operating from both direct current. DC and alternating current AC voltage supplies It is also desirable that the ballast circuit should supply only the amount of energy necessary to maintain the arc condition of the gas discharge tube, and that it should be easily adaptable to meet the various needs of the arc discharge tube.In accordance with the present invention a ballast circuit supplies timed pulse additions TPA , at predetermined durations of the applied voltage, to a gas discharge tube of a lighting unit so that the arc condition of the discharge tube is continuously maintained.The lighting unit has the gas discharge tube as its main light source, and a filament serving as a resistive element and as a supplementary light source. The ballast circuit is adapted to accept an applied voltage across first and second input terminals, and has an output stage capable of accepting across first and second output terminals a serial arrangement of a filament and a gas discharge tube having a starting circuit.The ballast circuit further comprises a capacitive energy storage means provided with means for charging during a preselected portion of the applied voltage and having one end connected to one of the input terminals of the ballast circuit. Switching means are connected to the other end of the capacitive energy storage means, and bias network means responsive to a selected portion of the applied voltage render the switching means conductive, whereby the energy stored in the capacitive energy storage means is discharged into the gas discharge tube.By way of example only, several embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which FIG. 1 shows a lighting unit,FIG. 2 is a ballast circuit for use in the lighting unit of Fig. 1,FIG. 3 is a simplified diagram of the circuit of Fig. 2,FIG. 4 is a timing diagram related to the operation of the circuit of Fig. 2,FIG. 5 is a first alternative ballast circuit, FIG. 6 is a timing diagram related to the operation of the circuit of Fig. 5,FIG. 7 is a timing diagram related to the operation of a modified Fig. 5,FIG. 8 is a simplified diagram of a second alternative ballast circuit,FIG. 9 is a timing diagram related to the operation of the circuit of Fig. 8, FIG. 10 is a full circuit diagram of the simplified circuit of Fig. 8,FIG. 11 shows various waveforms related to the operation of the circuit of Fig. 10,FIG. 12 is a third alternative ballast circuit,FIG. 13 is a fourth alternative ballast circuit, andFIG. 14 is a fifth alternative ballast circuit.Fig. 1 shows a lighting unit 60 having a gas discharge tube shown in phantom as the main light source, and a filament as a supplementary light source also shown in phantom spatially disposed within a lighttransmissive outer envelope 62. The lighting unit 60 has an electrically conductive base 64 and a housing 66 for lodging the electrical components of the unit.Fig. I further shows the housing 66 as confining restrictive ballast circuit 10, 40 or 50 shown more clearly respectively in Figs. 2, 5 or 10.Fig. 2 shows a ballast circuit for a gas discharge tube which may be of the highly efficient type described in our US Patent 4,161,672 D. M. Cap and W H. Lzke , The ballast circuit 10 is arranged to accept an alternating current AC. source applied across its first L1 and a second L2 input terminals. In general, the ballast circuit 10, and also ballast circuits 40 and 50, to be described, has means to provide a charge for a capacitive energy storage means having one of its ends coupled to a switching means. The switching means has a bias network which is responsive to an applied voltage so as to render the switching means conductive during a preselected portion of the applied A.C. voltage. The output stage of the circuit arrangement 10 is capable of accepting across its first and second output terminals a serial arrangement of a tungsten filament and a gas discharge tube having a starting circuit.The ballast circuit 10 comprises a first capacitor energy storage device C1A and a second capacitor storage device CIB The circuit arrangement 10 has means, shown as diodes D1A, D3A, D13 and D3B, for providing a path for the A.C. voltages to charge the capacitor energy storage devices Cl A and Cl B each during a preselected portion of the A.C. voltages The ballast circuit further comprises a first 12A and a second 12B current control device respectively related to the capacitor energy storage devices Cl A and Cl B The first 12A and the second 12B are conditionally responsive to the applied A.C voltage through their respective bias networks, so as to provide a path to discharge their respective capacitor energy storage device Cl A or C1 t at selected portions of the A.C. voltage signal so that extinction of the gas discharge tube during its steady state mode of operation is prevented.Further, the characteristics of 12A and 12B are such as to always direct the discharge preferentially through the discharge tube and never back into the A.C. supply line. FIG. 2 shows the arrangement of the starting circuit 11 as comprised of a plurality of conventional elements of the type indicated or having typical component values both as given in Table 1. TABLE 1 Element Typical Value or Type Qs SIDAC type K1200E of Teccor Co., Dallas, Texas 75261. Cs Capacitor 0.05 us 400 volts. TS Autotransformer construction using a pair of Ferroxcube, Saugerties, NY 12477 type 813E187 3E2A E cores and a type 990 023 01 bobbin wound with a 20 turn primary and a 400 turn secondary using t30 enamel covered wire. R5 Resistor having a value of 15K fl and a rating of 1 watt. The starting circuit 11 provides the necessary voltages so as to transition the gas discharge tube from its 1 initial state regliring a high applied voltage to cause an initial arcing of the gas discharge tube, 2 to its glow to arc mode, and then 3 its final steady state run condition.The starting circuit 11 operates in the following manner, 1 when the gas discharge tube is initially energized it is a relatively high impedance device so that the current initially flows through R5 charging Cs, 2 when the voltage on capacitor C5 equals or exceeds the breakdown or turn on voltage approximately 120 volts of the SIDAC QSR connected in a parallel manner across Cs, via a ferrite transformer T51 QS is rendered conductive, 3 the conductive QS provides a low impedance path so that the energy stored on capacitor Cs is suddenly discharged, through the primary of T5 which produces a potential sufficient for ionization of the gas discharge tube, 4 this discharge energy is of a sufficient magnitude to cause an initial arcing condition of the gas discharge tube, 5 the gas discharge tube then sequences from its initial state to its glow mode and finally to its steady state run mode, 6 when the gas discharge tube is in its steady state run condition it becomes a relatively low impedance and low voltage device so that the current is preferentially directed to the gas discharge tube, and finally 7 , the starting circuit 22 is effectively removed from the ballast circuit 20 since the conducting lamp prevents the voltage on Cs from reaching the turn on voltage of the SIDAC QS. The circuit arrangement 10 has two symmetrical sub arrangements, shown by the use of subscripts A andB, with each sub arrangement having a plurality of conventional elements of the type or having the typical component values given in Table 2.

The two sub arrangements having the subscripts A or B operate in a similar manner with the sub arrangement A controlling the operation of circuit 10 during the positive portion of the applied A.C.voltage and sub arrangement B controlling the operation of circuit 10 during the negative portion of the applied A.C. voltage. The circuit arrangement of sub arrangements A and B are essentially the same in a structural manner and for the sake of brevity only the structural arrangement of circuit sub arrangement A is described with the understanding that this description is equally applicable to the circuit of sub arrangement B. The current controlled device 12 of subarrangement A has three terminals 1eA, 16A, and 18A The terminal 14A is connected to the node formed from three devices 1 the cathode of a forward conducting diode D2 A which has its anode connected to one side of the output stage, and to the cathode of a forward conducting diode D1A, 2 one end of a resistor R2 A which has its other end connected to the terminal 18A of device 12A, and 3 the anode of the switching means 51A which has its cathode connected to the terminal L1 and its gate connected to one end of resistor R1A which, in turn, has its other end connected to the cathode of the switching means S1B, terminal L2, and to a network 30A Network 30A is comprised of a switching means S2A, transistor Q4AF diode D7A, and resistors R3Ai R4A and R5A. The diode D7A has its anode connected to one side of capacitor C1 and its cathode connected to the base of transistor 04A and also to one end of resistor R5A, which, in turn, has its other end connected to the cathode of switching means Ski . The transistor 04A has its emitter connected to the side of capacitor C1A. The collector of transistor 04A is connected to a node formed from one end of each resistor R3A and R4A. The other end of resistor R3A is connected to the gate of switching means 52A, whereas, the other end of resistor R4A is connected to the anode of switching means 52AThe cathode of switching means 52A is connected to a terminal 18A of the current controlled device 12A The second terminal 16A of device 12A is connected to one side of the output stage of circuit 10. The current control device 12A is comprised of a serial arrangement of transistors Q3AX 02A and 01A The collector of transistor Q1A has a serial arrangement of diodes D5A, D6A and D7A. For the embodiment shown in FIG. 2 the diodes D5A, D6A and D7 A are desired to provide a voltage drop across their terminals to assure saturation of device 12A during its forward current flow. The operation of one embodiment of the present invention shown as circuit arrangement 10 of FIG. 1 may best be described by first referring to a simplified diagram of circuit arrangement 10 which is shown inFIG. 3. FIG. 3 shows the capacitor C1 as interrelated to the first current control device 12A and the first switching means S1A, whereas, the capacitor C1 is shown as interrelated to the second current control device 12B and the second switching means 51B In general, the capacitor C1 and ClB are charged during the peak voltages of the applied A.C.voltage and then discharged under the control of 12A and 12D, respectively, into the gas discharge tube when reignition or restrike energy is needed for the gas discharge tube which condition typically occurs when the applied A.C. voltage transitions through its zero condition. The discharge energy or timed pulse addition of CIA and Cl B allows the arc condition of the gas discharge tube during its steady state mode of operation to be continuously maintained. The portions of the applied A.C. voltage are preferentially and adaptively selected so that the timed pulse addition TPA supplied by the discharge of the capacitor C1 and Clg is only accomplished when the gas discharge tube desires such additions for inhibiting the arc condition extinction.The desired selected portions of the applied A.C. voltage at which the capacitor C1 and C1 are discharged are best cesc.i es with reference to FIG. 4. FIG. 4 is segmented into ten sub secticns shown as 1 FI. 4 a showing an A.C. voltage waving an uppermost portion with a OOto 3600 variation of theA.C. voltage 2 FIG. 4 b showing the open non conductive and closed conductive states of the transistor 44A 3 FIG. 4 c showing the closed conductive and open non conductive states of switching means 52A 4 FIG. 4 d showing the closed conductive and open non conductive states of current controlled device 12A 5 FIG. 4 e showing the closed conductive and open non conductive states of transistor Q4B 6 FIG. 4 f showing the closed conductive and open non conductive states of switching means S2B 7 FIG. 4 g showing the closed conductive and open non conductive states of the current controlled device 128 8 FIG. 4 h showing the line current flowing into terminal L1 and out of terminal L2 and defined as 1positive in polarity 9 FIG. 4 i showing the waveform of the lamp voltage which is the voltage applied across the gas discharge tube of FIG. 2 defined as positive on top, measured with respect to bottom as drawn and 10 FIG. 4 j showing the waveform of the lamp current flowing in the gas discharge tube of FIG. 2 defined as positive when flowing in the same direction as the previously defined flow of line current of FIG. 4 h . From FIG. 4 i it should be noted that the lamp voltage has a waveshape which resembles a square wave.Furthermore, the initial positive and negative portions of the square wave of FIG. 4 i are respectively sharply rising and sharply falling types. The waveshape of FIG. 4 i is of substantial importance to the present invention in that the circuit arrangement 10 of FIG. 2 generates this type waveshape even though the applied A.C. voltage of FIG. 4 a which periodi cally transitions through its zero conditions with a typical sinusoidal shape may cause the arc condition of the gas discharge tube to experience an extinction.Still further, the practice of the present invention only generates the spike like or capacitive kick timed pulse addition TPA when it is necessary to prevent extinction of the arc condition of the gas discharge tube. A comparison between FIGS. 4 a and 4 i reveals that the sharply rising and sharply falling portions of the square wave of FIG. 4 i are respectively related to the Oa and 1800 portions of A.C. voltage of FIG.4 a . The sharply rising portions of the lamp voltage of FIG. 4 i are controlled by 1 the open and closed states of the transistor 04A of FIG. 4 b 2 the open and closed state of the switching means 52A ofFIG. 4 c and 3 the open and closed states of the current control device 12A of FIG. 4 d , whereas, the sharply falling portions of the lamp voltage of FIG. 4 i are controlled by 1 the open and closed states of the transistor Q4 2 the open and closed states of the switching means S2B of FIG. 4 f and 3 the opened and closed states of the current control device 12B of FIG. 4 g . It should be noted that FIG. 4 c and FIG. 4 h are related by an event 30, and that FIG. 4 d and FIG.4 j are related by an event 32. Similarly from FIG. 4 it should be noted that, FIG. 4 f and FIG. 4th are related by an event 34 and that FIG. 4 g and FIG. 4 j are related by an event 36. The events 30 and 34 are related to the zero condition of the line current ofFIG. 4jh and the events 32 and 36 are related to the lamp current of FIG. 4 j . The sharply rising and sharply falling portions of the square wave waveform of the lampe voltage sf FIG.4 i ae provided by pre erentially discharging the energy stored in C1A and ClB into the gas discharge tube of FIG. 1. The discharge of CiA and CIB is respectively determined by the conductive states of current controlled devices 12A and 52A and 12B and S2B, which, in turn, are respectively rendered conductive or inhibited from conduction by the switching means 51A and transistor Q4A and switching means SlB and transistor 04B The discharge and charging of C1 and ClB is best described with reference to the circuit arrangement 10 of FIG. 2. In a manner as previously discussed, the sub arrangement A of circuit arrangement 10 related to the discharging and charging of CiA is only to be described with the understanding the description is also applicable to the sub arrangement B charging and discharging of C1B. Referring now to FIG. 2, initially CiA is charged to the peak line A.C. voltage through diodes DIA and D3A. During the positive half cycle Ll positive relative to L2 51B is conducting in response to the positive voltage applied via RlB, whereas, during the negative half cycle L2 positive relative to Ll S1A is conducting in response to the positive voltage applied via RiA On the positive half cycle, 04A is conductive via the positive voltage applied via RSA The conduction of 04A inhibits the triggering and subsequent conduction of switching means S2A. switching means 52A is only allowed to conduct once during a selected portion of the positive half cycle of the line voltage. During a major portion of the negative half cycle current is flowing from terminal L2, through diode Dl up througit the arc tube and filament, through. D2A, and 51A back to terminal L1. The current flowing through diode D2A back biases or reverse biases the transistors Q1At Q2A and 03A so as to inhibit current flowing through S2A so that 52A is maintained in its non conductive state. Referring now to FIGS. 4 a , 4 b , 4 c and 4 d , more particularly, to the segment 24 of FIG. 4 related to FIGS. 4 a , 4 b , 4 c and 4 , it is seen that during the negative half cycle of FIG. 4 a , and a small portion of the positive half cycle transistorQ4A of FIG. 4 b is in a non conductive open state, and, in turn, allows 52A to be triggered into conduction with the voltage of C1 via the path ofR4A and R3 A However, 52A does not immediately conduct, due to the aforementioned back biased condition of 12A At the beginning of the positive half cycle, the no longer back biased condition of current controlled device 12A in turn allows switching means S2A to conduct, as shown in FIG. 4 c as device 52A transitioning from its open to its closed state. The closure of 52A forward biases device 12A, via resistor R2A causing device 12A to saturate. The closed state of each of the current control device 12A and the switching means 52A provides the path for discharging the energy stored in capacitor C1A into the gas discharge tube which inhibits the extinction of the arc of the gas discharge tube that may typically occur during the zero condition of theA.C. voltage of FIG. 4a. As the voltage from the C1 decays to a value below that of the A.C. line, the switching means S2 is rendered non conductive shown in FIG. 4 c as switching means 52A transitivninc frs its closed to its open state, and rendered not retriggerable as shown in FIG. 4 b by event 30. At this juncture the line current is flowing through D1 and supplies the current to maintain the arc condition of the gas discharge tube.Further, at this juncture the lamp current now flows through diode D2B which reverse biases the current controlled device 12B rendering it non conductive as shown in FIGS. 4 a The transistor Q4B of FIG. 4 c , switching means 52B of FIG. 4of , and current controlled device 123 of FIG. 4 g operate during the transition of the negative half cycle of FIG. 4 a through its zero condition in a manner similar to that respectively described for transistor Q4AT switching means S2A, and current controlled device 12A so as to inhibit the arc extinction of the gas discharge tube during the positive half cycle zero condition. Further, the description of event 30 is equally applicable to event 34. The circuit arrangement 10 provides a timed pulse addition TPA at the beginning of a cycle of the A.C.voltage of FIG. 4 a . The timed pulse addition TPA at the beginning Pre is herein termed a Pre TPA. The duration of the conductive and non conductive states of switching means 51A is primarily determined, in part, by the value of resistance selected from R1 whereas, the duration of the conductive and non conductive states of current controlled device 12A is determined, in part, by the resistive value of R2A. It is important that the value selected for R2A be such as to cause the current controlled device 12A to be driven into its saturated condition when it is rendered conductive. Further, the durations of the conductive states of transistor Q is determined by te resistive value of resistor R5 , whereas, the ratios of the conductive states of switching means 52A is determined, in part, by the resistive values selected for R3A and R4A. Typical values for R1A, R2A, R3A, R4A and RSA along with the typical component for 51A have been given in Table 2.The above description related to the values and components selections for device 12A is equally applicable to device 12B Further, the capacitive value selected for the capacitive energy storage means C1A and C1 should be such as to supply enough stored energy to be discharged into the gas discharge tube so that the gas discharge tube does not extinguish when the voltage ofFIG. 4 a transitions through its zero condition. It should be recognized that the desired selected value of CIA is also determined by the duration controlled by the devices S1A, 12A Q4A, and S2 allowed for charging and discharging CiA and similarly the duration controlled by the devices Slgr 12B Q4B and S2B allowed for charging and discharging C1B. The. current controlled devices 12A and 12B ofFIG. 2 are of substantial importance to the present invention in that these devices each act as one way switches which safeguard against inadvertent conduction of these devices allowing current to be fed back into the A.C. line. The switching means 12A and 12B are each arranged in a circuit so as to accept a bias current flowing into the first electrode 14 or 14B to render the switching device 12A or 12B conductive such that current flows from the third electrode 18A or 18B to the second electrode 1 A or 16B . The second electrode 16A or 16B is in a circuit effectiv to supply c rrer.t to the gas discharge tube drink its conductive state.As previously mentioned, the terminal 16A or 16B is connected back to the terminal 14A or 14B, respectively, by diodes D2A or diode D2 B each serving as interconnection means and each providing a predetermined voltage drop and preferential conduction from the second electrode 16A or 16B to the first electrode 14A or 14B . The operation of these interconnecting means is such that when the current flowing through diode D2A or D2 establishes a voltage drop across diode D2 A or D2 B of typically 0.75 volts the current controlled devices 12A or 12B, respectively, are back biased or reverse biased and therefore inhibited from conduction.If the current controlled device 12A or 12 is inadvertently rendered conductive, the current flowing out of the emitter of 01A or Q1B is preferentially directed back toward and through the diode D2A orD2B respectively. The current flowing through diode D2 or D2 causes a voltage drop of approximately A B 0.75 volts, which, in turn, automatically inhibits the inadvertent conduction of current controlled device 12A or 12B In this manner, controlled device 12A or 12B acts as a one way switch only passing current into its desired path toward the gas discharge tube. The current controlled device 12A or 72B shown in FIG. 2 may be modified by removing the serially arranged diodes D4A, DSA and D6A or D4B, D5B and D6B. These diodes D4A . . D6B provide a desired voltage drop during the forward conduction of device 12A and 1231 but it has been determined that their removal may be accomplished and the current controlled devices 12A and 123 operate in their described manner, if the characteristics of specific transistors used for Q1AT and Q2 , and Q3A or Q B Q3 and Q3 permit saturation in the conductive states without diodes D4A...D6B. Another embodiment of the present invention is shown in FIG. 5 for a circuit arrangement 40. The circuit arrangement 40 of FIG. 5 is similar to the circuit arrangement 10 of FIG. 2 with the exception that circuit arrangement 40 does not have the networks 30A and 30B of FIG. 2. The elements of the circuit arrangement 40 have the same reference number and the same general description of the elements of the circuit arrangement 10. The essential operating condition between circuit arrangements 10 and 40 is that as previously described the circuit arrangement 10 of FIG. 2 applies a PRE TPA to the gas discharge tube, whereas, the circuit arrangement 40 of FIG. 5 applies aTPA both at the beginning and at the end of the cycle of the A.C voltage of FIG. 4 a .The operation of the circuit arrangement 40 is herein termed FULL TPA. The operation of the circuit arrangement 40 ofFIG. 5 may be described by referring to the timing diagram of FIG. 6. FIG. 6 is similar to FIG. e in that it is segmented into eight 8 Figures, 1 FIG. 6 a showing the applied A.C. voltage of FIG. 5, 2 FIG. 6 b showing the closed and open states of the switching means S1A, 3 FIG. 6 c showing the closed and open states of current controlled device 13 4 FIG. 6 d showing the closed and open states of the switching means Slg, 5 FIG. 6 e showing the closed and open states of the current controlled device 12but 6 FIG. 6 f showing the waveform of the line current flowing into terminal L1 and out of terminal L2 and defined as positive in polarity, 7 FIG. 6 g showing the waveform of the lamp voltage and 8 FIG. 6 h s owing the waveform of the lamp current.In a manner similar to that described ror FIt i , from FIG. 6 it should be noted that the 12 .D voltage has a waveshape resembling that of a square wave. The conductive states of current controlled devices 12A and 12B of FIG. 5 primarily determine the discharge state of energy storage devices CIA and Cl B respectively. Supplying the timed pulse additions TPA of FIG. 6 g in a manner previously disclosed for FIG. 2 for the conductive states of the current controlled device 12A is only to be described. As previously discussed with regard to FIG. 2, when the switching means 51A is rendered nonconductive, shown in FIG. 6 b as switching means 51A transitioning from its closed to its open state, the current controlled device 12A is rendered conductive which is shown in FIG. 6 c by the transition of 51A from its open to its closed state. As soon as current controlled device 12A is rendered conductive, the energy stored in Cl A is discharged into the gas discharge tube via the path 22A, shown in FIG. 5, which, is seen in the lamp current waveform of FIG. 6 h as the positive going spike at the beginning of the half cycle.The energy of CiA is discharged into the gas discharge tube until the line voltage of FIG. 6 a increases and becomes substantially equal to the voltage of capacitor ClA At this juncture current is supplied to the gas discharge tube by the line current FIG. 6 f and this line current also recharges Cl A by way of path provided by diode D3 A Subsequently as the line voltage FIG. 6 a starts to fall, while current controlled device 12A is still conducting, discharge current again flows out of CIA into the gas discharge tube, adding current to the line waveform and products an augmented tail. subsequently, as shown in FIGS.6 b and 6 c by event 42, switching means 51A transitions to its closed state, which, in turn, causes current control device 12A to transition to its open state as the negative going voltage of the lamp voltage 6 g starts to increase for operation of the negative half cycle through device 12B The circuit arrangement 40 of FIG. 5 operating in a manner as described with reference to FIG. 6 maintains the desired arc condition of the gas discharge tube even though the applied A.C. voltage transitions through its polarity reversed. The amount of energy developed by either of the circuit arrangements 40 of FIG. 5 or 10 of FIG. 2 may be increased by changing the selected value of capacitors C1 and Clg from 10 F to 50 F. The 50 F capacitors C1A and Cl B increased the amount of stored energy which is discharged into the gas discharge tube by a factor of five 5 to one 1 relative to the 10 F capacitors C1 and Crib. The circuit arrangement 10 and 40, supplies the desired TPA without releasing electromagnetic energy back onto the applied A.C. voltage. Further, although current controlled devices 12A and 12B have been described as bipolar devices, the function of devices 12A and 12B may also be implemented with MOS devices, such as VMOS field effect transistors, or insulated gate rectifiers or any device capable of being turned on and off with a control bias of the nature described. Only diodes D1x, D3A and DlB and D3 B are necessary to recharge the capacitor C1 and Clog, respectively.Still further, the practice of this invention contemplates the usage o a single device for 12 and 1 23r such as a custom designed bipolar device or cc mercially available Power MGSFEm or IGR Insu3 ed Gate Rectifier devices. Further still, although SlA, Sir S2A and s23 have been disclosed as a Silicon Controlled Rectifier SCR the practice of this invention contemplates the usage of a power MOSFET or IGR devices for either S1A, Slgr 52A or S2B. A further embodiment of the present invention is provided by alternating the circuit arrangement 40 ofFIG. 5. The alternation is accomplished by interposing a resistive element between each of the anode of diodeD4A of the current controlled device 12A and diodeD4 B of the current controlled device 123 and their respective capacitor C1 and Cl B The operation of the circuit arrangement 40 of FIG. 5 having the added resistive element is best described with reference toFIG. FIG. 7 is similar to the previously described FIG.6 except for the waveshapes of FIG. 7 g showing the lamp voltage and FIG. 7 h showing the lamp current. A comparison between FIG. 6 g and FIG. 7 g and FIG. 6 h and FIG. 7 h reveal that 1 the lamp voltage ofFIG. 7 g has a square waveshape that has a positive and negative peak portions which occur later in the cycle than FIG. 6tg and these peak portions slowly decay but rise again later in the cycle and 2 the lamp current of FIG.7 h has a waveshape having higher positive and negative peaks than those of FIG. 6 h that occur in the central portion of the applied A.C.voltage of FIG. 7 a and the initial and terminal portions of each half cycle of the lamp current of FIG.7 h have a plateau like waveshape. The plateaus along with the peaked portions are indicative that lamp current is substantially, continuously flowing in the gas discharge tube even though the applied k.C, voltage of FIG. 7 a delays and rises in a sinusoidal manner through its polarity reversed conditions. The resistor added to te circuit arraneet 80 acjus s the discharge lime constant of the capacitors CiA and Clg and provides for the plateau waveshape of FIG. 7 h . The value of the resistive element added to the circuit arrangement 40 of FIG. 5 may be selected so as to adjust or adapt the discharge time constant of the capacitor ClA Aor ClB into the gas discharge tube of FIG. 5. The discharge time constant may be selected so as to preferentially adapt the circuit arrangement 10 to the needs of the gas discharge tube of FIG. 5. For the waveshape shown in FIG. 7 the resistive element was selected to have a value of 1500 Q and the capacitors ClA and Clg had a value of 10 iF. Although the addition of the resistive element has been described with reference to circuit arrangement 40 of FIG. 5, it should be recognized that the resistive element may also be added to the circuit arrangement 10 of FIG. 2 in a manner as described for FIG. 5. It should now be appreciated that the various embodiments of the present invention provide TimedPulse Additions TPA to occur during various portions by the applied A.C. voltage so as to continuously maintain the arc condition of the gas discharge tube during its steady state mode of operation. The present invention is further directed to a ballast circuit that operates in response to a rectified A.C. voltage applied to its input. The ballast circuit responsive to a rectified A.C. is best described by first referring to FIG. 8. FIG. 8 shows an A.C. line applied across a conventional full wave rectifier formed of diodes D10,Dll, D12 and D13 arranged as shown in FIG. 8. FIG. 8 further shows a location 3 at the input of a switching means 53, a location A at the input to a switc , means 54 and locations B ad C oppositely located across the gas discharge tL C. The full wave rectifier develops an undulating D.C. voltage VDC which is applied to the FILAMENT and GAS DISCHARGE TUBE under control of the closed state of switching means 53 while switching means S4 is in its open state. The states of switching means S4 controls the coupling of the capacitor C2 into and out of the circuit of FIG. 8. The circuit of FIG. 8 operates in a similar manner as that of FIG. 3 in that the charging and discharging of capacitor C2 is accomplished so that Timed PulseAdditions TPA are supplied to the gas discharge tube only when there is a danger that the arc condition of , the gas discharge tube may extinquish due to the zero voltage conditions related to the developed D.C.voltage VDC The zero voltage conditions related to the developed D.C. voltage VDC and the general interrelationships of the circuit of FIG. 8 may be best described by reference to FIG. 9 along with reference to the circuit of FIG. 8. FIG. 9 is segmented into five 5 sections, 1 FIG. 9 a showing the D.C. stage VDC of FIG. 8, 2 FIG. 9 b showing the waveform of voltage VBC of FIG.8 applied across the gas discharge tube, 3 FIG. 9 c showing the waveform of the current IBC flowing through the gas discharge tube, 4 FIG. 9 d showing the closed conductive and open non conductive states of switching means S3, and 5 FIG. 9 e showing the closed conductive and open non conductive states of switching means of switching means S4. Initially switching means 53 and SO are both in their closed state so that capacitor C2 is charged to the peak value of the first cycle of the VDC sinai of FIG. 9 a and the VDC signal is also applied to the gas discharge tube. Switching means S4 is opened as scon as the current char ir.g the ca zitor C2 reaches a zero condition, thereby isolating the charge of C2 for use on the next cycle of VDC of FIG. 9 a .The current flowing through switching means S3 maintains the arc condition of the gas discharge tube during most of the remainder of the cycle. At the end of the cycle, of VDC of FIG. 9 a , switching means S3 is opened and concurrently switching means S4 is closed, which, in turn, causes the full peak voltage on the capacitor C2 to be relatively instantly discharged into the gas discharge tube so as to maintain its arc condition. At this juncture, the positive going voltage VDC at point D of FIG. 7 is rising toward its peak value. As soon as the voltage difference between point D and point A is approximately zero, the switching means S3 is closed. At this zero difference condition the voltage of VDC has risen to a value capable of maintaining the arc condition of the gas discharge tube. The voltage VDC continues to rise and recharge the capacitor C2. A circuit arrangement 50 which operates in the manner as described for the general diagram of FIG. 7 is shown in FIG. 10. FIG. 10 shows the circuit arrangement 50 as having an A.C. voltage applied across the full wave rectifier 52 formed of diodes D10, Dll, D12, and D13 previously discussed with regard to FIG. 8. Figure 10 further shows a plurality of elements of the type or having the typical values given in Table 3. TABLE 3Element ovse R6 100K, 1 4 watt carbon corpo SitlO resistorR7 1.8K, 1 4 watt carbon composition resistorR8 200K, 1 4 watt carbon composition resistorR9 15K, 1 4 watt carbon composition resistor RIO 100K, 1 4 watt carbon composition resistorD8, D9, D101 Dll, 1 amp, 400 PIV Silicon DiodeD12, and D13 S5 Silicon Controlled Rectifier of Teccor Co. type 2N5064 Q5 Silicon transistor of Motorola type 2N6517 FIG. 10 further shows capacitors C4 and C5 whose values are to be described with regard to the operation of the circuit arrangement 50. FIG. 10 shows the output VDC of the D.C.rectifier 52 applied across a serial arrangement of resistors R7 and R8. A node formed from one end of each of the resistors R7 and R8 is connected to the base of transistor 05. The other end of resistor R8 is connected to the anode of a forward conducting diode D9 having its cathode connected to one end of resistorR9. The other end of resistor R7 is connected to the emitter of transistor Q5 which has its collector connected to a node formed from one end of each of resistor R6 and a resistor R10. The other end of resistor RIO is connected to 1 the other end of resistor R9, and to 2 the gate of switching means S5. The other end of resistor R6 is connected to, 1 the anode of switching reans SS, 2 the cathode of diode 28 3 and to one en of capacitor Ce having it other end connected to one end of capacitor C5 and to the emitter of transistor Q5. The switching means S5 has its cathode connected to the anode of diode D8.The switching means S5, connected to diode D8, is similar to that shown in the network 30A and 30B in that it is a voltage control device having a first terminal gate connected to a bias network, a second terminal cathode connected to the terminal of the output stage, and third terminal anode connected to storage capacitor means C4. The diode D8 along with capacitor C4 is arranged in a parallel manner across capacitor C5, which, in turn, is arranged in a parallel manner across a serial arranged filament and gas discharge tube. The gas discharge tube has a starting circuit 11 not shown inFIG. 9 but previously referred to with regard to FIG.2. The circuit arrangement 50 has capacitor C4 and C5 each having various values from 0 to approximately 50 microfarads selected so as to accomplish various desired circuit operations of the circuit arrangement 50. One of the desired operations may be described by referring to FIG. 11 along with FIG. 10 with the assumption that C5 has a value of zero and C4 has a value of approximately 2 microfarads. FIG. 11 is segmented into five 5 sections 1 FIG. ll a showing the waveform of the applied voltageVDC 2 FIG. ll b showing the lamp voltage of the gas discharge tube 3 FIG ll c showing the line current flowing thru the filament and gas discharge tube 4 FIG. ll d showing the open non conductive and closed conductive states of the switching means S3 and 5 FIG. 11 e showing the open non conductive and closed condllctive states of the transistor 05. Initially capacitor C4 is charged to the peak values of VDC of FIG. ll a via the path formed from diodes D8 and D9. During this condition, the full wave rectified voltage VDC of FIG. 11 a at point D FIG. 10 causes the conduction of Q5 via, the path of resistor R8 and is shown in this conductive state inFIG, 11 e as Q5 in its closed state. Similarly, during this condition switching means S5 is inhibited from conduction via the conducting state of Q and is shown in this inhibited state in FIG. 11 d in 55 open state. When the VDC voltage of FIG. 11 a falls towards its low portion, it reaches a value, shown as an event 54 related to FIGS. ll a , 11 d and ll e , so that QS is inhibited from conduction which is shown in FIG. 11 e as Q5 transitioning from its closed to its open state.The open state of Q5 causes the voltage applied to the collector of Q5 to rise, which, in turn, allows the gate of switching means S5 to be triggered through the path provided by R6 and R10, thereby rendering S5 conductive as shown in FIG. ll d by S5 transitioning from its open to its closed state.The conduction of S5 causes the initially charged capacitor C4 to be effectively connected to point k ofFIG. 9. Initially, the voltage at point A is higher than the VDC voltage of FIG. 9 a at point D so that diodeD9 is back biased allowing the energy stored in capacitor C4 to discharge through the gas discharge tube. The discharge of capacitor C4 is manifested by the sudden rising spikes shown in both FIGS. ll b and alec related to the bottom portion of VDC of FIG. 11 a . As the discharge voltage of C4 starts its decay, the voltage of VDC at point D starts its rise. Subsequently, when the voltage at point D exceeds that at point r. rr line Cur en flows tb.rCj . D9 and begins to operate the gas discharge tube for the remaining portion of VDC until the reoccurrence of event 54. During this time capacitor C4 recharges to the line peak. The switching means S5 is automatically rendered non conductive when the current flowing through it falls to zero, shown by event 56, correspondingly causing 55 to transition from its closed to its open state, which condition occurs before the recharge current for C4 flows through diode D8. The operation of the circuit arrangement 50 is similar to the circuit arrangement 10 and 40 of FIGS 2 and 5, respectively, in that circuit arrangement 50 provides Timed Pulse Additions TPA to the gas discharge tube when the applied voltage VDC approaches a zero condition so as to continuously maintain the arc condition of the gas discharge tube during its steady state mode of operation. A further embodiment of the present invention of a ballast circuit that operates in response to a rectified A.C. voltage applied to its inputs is shown in FIG. 12. FIG. 12 shows a circuit arrangement 60 comprising the full wave rectifier 52, the filament and the gas discharge tube all described with reference to FIG.10. The circuit arrangement 60 further comprises a diode D14 of a 1 amp, 400 PIV silicon type, a capacitorC6 similar to capacitor C4 described for FIG. 10 having a typical value of 10 iF, a SIDAC device QD of the type K1050E of Teccor Co., having an inherent characteristic breakdown or turn on voltage of approximately 105 volts and a preferred resistor R11 interposed between the capacitor C6 and discharge tube for adjusting the discharge time of capacitor C6 in a similar manner as previously ces creed with regard to resistive element that a ec C circuit arrangements 10 or 40. The circuit arrangement 60 operates in a manner similar to circuit arrangement 50 and may be described with reference to FIGS. 11 a , ll b and 11 c . In the operation of circuit arrangement 60, initially the capacitor C6 is charged to the peak value of VDC FIG. ll a , having a value in the order of 150 volts, via the path provided by diode 214. When the VDC voltage of FIG. 11 a falls towards its low portion, the voltage across the lamp 11 b also falls and when the voltage across the lamp 11 b reaches a typical value of 45 volts a voltage difference of approximately 105 volts exists across the SIDAC QD. This 105 volts is established by one side of the SIDAC QD being connected to the charged 150 volts capacitor C6 and the other side connected, via resistor Rll, to the gas discharge tube at the voltage of 45 volts. For this 105 volt condition the SIDAC QD breaks down or turns on causing the energy timed pulse addition to be discharged into the gas discharge tube so as to continuously maintain the arc condition of the gas discharge tube during its steady state mode of operation. Another embodiment of the present invention of a ballast circuit that operates in response to a rectified A.C. voltage applied to its inputs is shown inFIG. 13. FIG. 13 shows a circuit arrangement 70 similar to the circuit arrangement 60 of FIG. 12 but having a silicon controlled rectifier SCR S6 and serially arranged resistors R12 and R13 connected across diodeD14 all in place of the SIDAC QD of FIG. 12. The silicon controlled rectifier S6 has a breakdown voltage determined by the second bias network formed by the arranged resistors 2 and 13. The rode O the resistors Ri2 and R13 is connected to the gate electrode of device S6, whereas, the anode of device 56 is connected to capacitor C6 and the cathode of device S6 is connected to the output stage via resistor Rll. The resistor R12 has a typical value of 1000 resistor R13 has a typical value of 130 K and the silicon controlled rectifier S6 may be of the type 2N5064 of Teccor Co. The circuit arrangement 70 operates in a manner similar to that described for circuit arrangement 60.The SCR device S6 of circuit arrangement 70 is rendered conductive, at the previously discussed 105 volt condition of the SIDAC QDT causing the discharge of the stored energy of the capacitor C6 into the gas discharge so as to continuously maintain the arc condition of the gas discharge tube during its steady state mode of operation. The silicon control rectifier S6 is rendered conductive at this 105 volt condition by the selections of resistance values of R12 and R13 and the selection of the type of the SCR as all previously given with regard to FIG. 13. A still further embodiment of the present invention is shown in FIG. 14 as a circuit arrangement 80. Circuit arrangement 80 is similar to the previously described circuit arrangements 60 and 70 with the exception that the discharge path of the stored energy of capacitor C6 to the gas discharge tube is provided by a second filament FILAMENT 2. FILAMENT 2 is particularly advantageous in the circuit arrangement 80 in that, 1 it can provide additional incandescent supplementary light to the improved lighting unit 10 of FIG. 1, 2 its resistance value is a function of the temperature of the envircnrent improved ln ing unit 10 in which it is lodged. The resistance value of FILAMENT 2 increases due to self heating from the current passing thru it, and also increases as the temperature of the environment in which it is lodged increases which is particularly suitable for the improved lighting unit 10. During the initial starting of the gas discharge tube the environment of the improved lighting unit is at the lower end of its operating temperature range so that the FILAMENT 2 is at its lower end of its resistance value range. The FILAMENT 2 during this lower temperature condition provides a low resistance discharge path of the stored energy of capacitor C6 into the gas discharge tube which augments the starting of the gas discharge tube. Further, as the temperature of the improved lighting unit 10 increases due to heat created by the operating discharge tube, the resistance value of the FILAMENT 2 also increases, which, in turn, increases the resistance of the discharge path of capacitor C6, which, in turn, reduces the stored energy discharged into the operating gas discharge tube. The resistance of FILAMENT 2 may be adapted to the environment of the lighting unit 10 to improve the operational response of the gas discharge tube by the appropriate selection of the parameters, such as wire diameter, wire length, and coil winding configuration of the FILAMENT 2. The resistance of FILAMENT 2 may be further adapted to improve the operational response of the gas discharge tube by appropriate placement within the improved lighting unit 10. The FILAMENT 2 may be appropriately lodged, in a preferred manner, in close proximity to the gas discharge tube, shown in FIG. 1 as disposed within the light transmissive outer envelope 62, so that it provides a low resistance discharge pa for capacitor C6 during the initial starting of the gas discharge tube b jt its resistance ciscnarge path is increased is a relatively rapid manner due to the rapidly developing heat of the operating gas discharge tube.The appropriate lodging and parameter selection of FILAMENT 2 may be further adjusted to control the discharge rate of capacitor C6 in a manner similar to that desired for the added resistant element of FIGS.2, 5, 10, 12 and 13. It should be appreciated that the hereinbefore given discussion related to the connection of FILAMENT 2 to point A in FIGS. 12, 13, and 14, applies as well to an alternative connection ofFILAMENT 2 to point B. It should now be appreciated that the present invention provides ballast circuits applicable to both direct A.C. and rectified A.C. applied voltages. The ballast circuits of the present invention only supplyTimed Pulse Additions to the gas discharge tube in the amount necessary to maintain the arc condition of the gas discharge tube in its steady state mode of operation. Further, the ballast circuits of the present invention are easily adaptable to the various needs of the gas discharge tube. Although the hereinbefore described circuits are related to a gas discharge tube having a breakdown, glow and steady state mode, it should be appreciated that the practice of this invention contemplates the use of the described various embodiments with other devices such as 1 a relatively high pressure sodium vapor lamp such as the commonly known LUCALO ffi lamp type of the General Electric Company, and 2 fluorescent and low pressure sodium type arc discharge lamps.
