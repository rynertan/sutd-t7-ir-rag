# Process for obtaining an insecticidal product and composites thereof.

## Abstract
A process is described by which the pair of isomers represented by R α acyano 4 fluoro 3 phenoxybenzyl 1R,cis 3 2,2 dichlorovinyl 2,2 dimethylcyclopropane car boxylate and its enantiomer is converted by base catalysed epimerisation in solution into the insecticidally more useful isomer pair represented by S α cyano 4 fluoro 3 phenoxybenzyl 1R,cis 3 2,2 dichlorovinyl 2,2 dimethylcyclopropane carboxylate and its enantiomer, which may then be caused to crystallise out from the solution.
