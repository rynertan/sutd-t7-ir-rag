# Radio system.

## Abstract
A multichannel duplex radio system for cordless tele phone in which digital information is sent between the two ends. The data is divided into blocks which are transmitted in a fraction of the original block length. The other time slots are used for the duplex return path and for other similar equipment operating nearby. A direct conversion radio receiver is used in which the local oscillator signal is mod ulated for transmission.
