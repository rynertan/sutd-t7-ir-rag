# Radiation sensitive compounds, methods of producing them and radiation sensitive plates based on such materials.

## Abstract
The radiation sensitive compound contains at least two groups having the structure A N Ar R X X¹ in which Ar represents a divalent or other polyvalent radical derived from an aromatic or heteroaromatic compound X and X which may be the same or different, each represents O, S or an imino group, provided that at least one of X and X is an imino group, Y represents O or S, R represents a single bond or a divalent or other polyvalent radical and A is an anion. It may be produced by i reacting a compound con taining a diazo group precursor and having one or more OH, SH, NH₂, NH groups with a compound having a plurality of NCO, NCS, OCOCl, or NOCl groups, ii converting the precursor as necessary into a diazo group, and iii reacting the diazo groups with an acid. The compound is useful for the production of radiation sensitive plates for lithographic printing plate manufacture.
