# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR OBTAINING HIGH RESOLUTION SUBSURFACE GEOPHYSICAL MEASUREMENTS

## Abstract
A subsurface geophysical parameter measurement is converted downhole to a first pulse train whose instan taneous frequency is a function of the parameter value. In response to a first control signal, a first counter begins a first count of pulses from the first pulse train, and a second counter begins a count of second pulses from a downhole reference oscillator. The first and second counts are ter minated in response to a second control signal and the first and second counters are interrogated. A ratio is then de veloped between the first and second counts which is func tionally related to the value of the parameter.
