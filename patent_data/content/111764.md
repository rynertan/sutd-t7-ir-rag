# Stator of submerged pump.

## Abstract
To produce a stator of a submerged motor of satisfac tory quality free from the problem of an eddy current losses requires the provision of cylinders formed of carbon fiber reinforced plastics of superhigh precision. Difficulties have been experienced in producing this type of cylinders in small wall thickness, and the cylinders produced have raised various problems including in ability to be joined with end covers 5a, 5b in good condition. The problem of how to obtain flawless jonts between the cylinders of carbon fiber reinforced plastics and the end covers is solved by providing increased wall thickness portions 6a, 6b to opposite axial end portions of an inner cylinder 4 near the joints with the ends covers, one increased wall thickness portion 6a being located at one axial end portion on an outer side surface thereof and the other increased wall thickness portion 6b being located at the other axial end portion on an inner side surface thereof. Thus the inner cylinder 4 has a small wall thickness at an axial central portion to reduce an eddy current loss while its wall thickness is increased at the opposite axial end portions to improve mechanical strength and facilitate joining the end covers 5a, 5b to the inner cylinder 4 .
