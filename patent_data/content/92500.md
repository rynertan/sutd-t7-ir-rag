# HELICOPTER ENGINE TORQUE COMPENSATOR

## Abstract
The blade angle controlling pitch beam servo 26 of a heli copter tail rotor 22 is responsive to a signal manifestation 76 indicative of free turbine engine 20 gas generator speed 78 to provide torque compensation so that the helicopter airframe will not counter rotate under the main rotor 10 of a helicopter as a consequence of the torque provided thereto by the airframe mounted engine 20 , or in the absence thereof. A trimming embodiment provides only sufficient blade angle command 82a to compensate for that provided by fixed, collective tail mixing 110 114 . Torque compensation tail rotor blade angle commands may be applied through existing stability and autopilot actuators 30 32 or through an additional torque servo 120, .
