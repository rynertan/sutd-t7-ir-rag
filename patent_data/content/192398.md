# LINER SETTING DEVICE FOR WELLS

## Abstract
A liner setting apparatus which is especially but not exclusively useful in a gravel packing system, comprises a housing 200 having a housing bore 202 disposed there through.A ball valve 272 is disposed in the housing and has a ball valve bore 444 disposed therethrough. The ball valve is rotatable between an initial closed position and an open position wherein the ball valve bore is aligned with the housing bore. A differential pressure responsive liner setting assembly 310 is operably associated with the housing for setting the liner hanger in response to an increase in fluid pressure within an upper portion of the housing bore above the initially closed ball valve. A differential pressure respon sive valve actuating assembly 348 is operably associated with the ball valve for moving the ball valve from its initial closed position to its open position in response to an increase in fluid pressure within a well annulus external of the apparatus. After the ball valve has been opened, a concentric inner tubing string can be received through the ball valve bore thereof for insertion into a gravel packing apparatus located therebelow.
