# Liquid film type, anion selective electrode.

## Abstract
A liquid film type, anion selective electrode of the present invention is suitable for measuring a chloride ion concentration of blood. A sensitive film contains a plurality of plasticizers having different dielectric constants, an anion sensitive substance and a polymeric support material for supporting them. An appropriate content of o nitrophenyloctylether having a high dielectric constant is 5 30 by weight, an appropriate content of n tetradecyl alcohol having a low dielectric constant 5 40 by weight, and an appropriate content of dimethyldioctadecylammo nium chloride as the anion sensitive substance is 5 30 by weight. An electrode for measuring anions with such a sensitive film has less adverse effect by protein on measure ments. The sensitive film further containing n dodecyl alcohol has a much small error of measurement.
