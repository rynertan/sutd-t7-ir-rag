# Polymerisation of alpha olefins.

## Abstract
A process for polymerizing alpha olefins in the presence of a Ziegler type catalyst wherein at least one of dich loroethane, dichloropropane and chlorine gas is added to the process after the polymerization has been initiated and at least 5.0 of the alpha olefin has been converted to polymer. This process is especially useful when the olefin is propylene and the catalyst is a titanium trichloride complex.
