# Bicyclic amide acetal polyamine polyisocyanate polymers.

## Abstract
A process is described for preparing novel polymers having good impact resistance and other desirable physical properties, said process comprising interpolymerizing a mixture of a bicyclic amide acetal, a polyamine and a polyisocyanate.
