# Pressure tight plug coupling.

## Abstract
A plug coupling for providing a pressure sealed connec tion to a device provided with a connecting member compris ing a cylindrical housing 12 a piston 14 shiftable within the housing 12 clamping jaws 26 connected to the piston 14 and concentrially arranged around the longitudinal axis of the housing 12 and radially displaceable by means of a ramp 32, 33 arrangement by an axial movement of the piston 14 relative to the housing 12 pressure is applied to said piston 14 for moving it in longitudinal direction of the housing 12 thereby pressing the clamping jaws 26 radially inwards or outwards by means of said ramp 32, 33 arrangement. The free ends of the clamping jaws 26 are moved into an engag ing position for engagement with said connecting member.
