# Power failure detection system for a glassware forming machine.

## Abstract
A glassware system is disclosed including at least one machine for forming rigid glassware with a plurality of separate machine elements whose movement is controlled by a controller. The controller includes means to store data corresponding to the normal condition of the machine elements in operation and upon start up, and means for detecting a departure from normal conditions and initiating a planned stop or modifcation to appropriately correct the operation of the machine. The controller may include a run table memory to store up information on the plurality of sequenced locations of the machine elements during their cyclical operation. A central console may be associated with the machines and controllers and include a stored library of job histories, with each job history including information upon the cyclical operation of the machine elements to form an associated type of glassware and indicia of the relative point in the cyclical operation at which the operation is to be effected. A designated job history may be directed to the specified machine controller means for storing data.
