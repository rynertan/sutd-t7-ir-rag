# Reusable electrophotographic element and process for preparing that element.

## Abstract
A reusable electrophotographic element comprising a photoconductive layer containing sensitized zinc oxide parti cles and first and second binding agents that are incompati ble. The first binding agent has a higher affinity to zinc oxide than the second binding agent, is largely deposited on the zinc oxide, is a macromolecular compound having an average molecular weight of at least 12,000 and is present in the photoconductive layer in an amount of 1.5 to 9 by weight calculated on the zinc oxide. The quantity of the second binding agent in the photoconductive layer is larger than that of the first binding agent, said layer being built up from agglomerates of zinc oxide particles being substantially enveloped with the first binding agent, which agglomerates have a diameter between 2.5 and 6 µm and are sticked together by means of the second binding agent to form a porous layer having a negative charge density of at most 1 m Coulomb per m². The electrophotographic element has a very high resistance to both electrical and mechanical influences.
