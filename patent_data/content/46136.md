# Membrane modified hydrogels, process for their manufacture and their use as active agent dispenser.

## Abstract
Non uniform water insoluble interpenetrating polymer blend compositions comprising a first permeable water swellable polymer substrate interpenetrated in a gradient substantially normal to the substrate surface by a second less permeable condensation polymer to form a diffusion rate controlling membrane therein. Such compositions are useful as polymers with reduced permeabilities for water and organic solvents and therefore for the controlled deliv ery of active ingredients such as fragrances and bioaffecting agents into air or aqueous environments, or in membrane separation processes.
