# Process and plant for cleaning hot waste gas occurring in varying amounts.

## Abstract
The ability of a waste gas cleaning spray drying absorber to tolerate substantial variations in the amount of waste gas to be cleaned is enhanced by a system which provides for introduction of any amount of waste gas that would overload the gas dis perser s 5 of the spray drying absorber 1, into said absorber via auxiliary apertures 8 in the walls thereof thereby bypassing 10 the gas disperser s . A plant for cleaning fluctuating amounts of waste gas comprises a control system 14 based on measurement of gas flow to the gas disperser s .
