# POLARISCOPE

## Abstract
A polariscope comprises an elongate flexible sheath 12 a distal end section 14 fixed to one end of the sheath 12 a control section 13 fixed to the other end of the sheath 12 an elongate light guide 17 extending through the distal end section 14 and the sheath 12 , also extending out of the control section 13 to be con nected to a light source 15 an elongate image guide 18 extending through the distal end section 14 , the sheath 12 and the control section 13 and having one end connected to an ocular section 19 in the control section 13 and the other end connected to an objective 20 in the distal end section 14 a first polarizer 24 which is rotatable about its center and faces an end of the light guide 17 in the distal end section 14 and a sec ond polarizer 25 which is coaxial with the objective 20 , parallel with the first polarizer 24 , and faces the ob jective 20 in the distal end section 14 . With this po lariscope, a photoelasticity measurement of the stress on the invisible interior of an object 38 to be measured can be carried out correctly and simply.
