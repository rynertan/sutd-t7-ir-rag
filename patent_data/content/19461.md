## Description
DESCRIPTION ABRASIVE BODIES THIS invention relates to abrasive bodies and more particularly to abrasive bodies which contain abrasive compacts.Abrasive compacts are known in the art. They consist essentially of a polycrystalline mass of abrasive particles, generally present in an amount of at least 70 percent, preferably 80 to 90 percent, by volume of the compact, bonded into a hard conglomerate. The abrasive particles of compacts are generally diamond or cubic boron nitride.Abrasive compacts, particularly diamond and cubic boron nitride compacts, may be self bonded, i.e. individual particles of the compact may be fused and bonded together without the aid of a metal or like bonding matrix.Alternatively, stronger and more durable compacts are produced when there is a suitable bonding matrix present.In the case of cubic boron nitride compacts, i.e. compacts in which the abrasive particle is predominantly cubic boron nitride, the bonding matrix, when provided, preferably contains a catalyst also known as a solvent for cubic boron nitride growth such as aluminium or an alloy of aluminium with nickel, cobalt, iron, manganese or chromium.In the case of diamond compacts, i.e. compacts in which the abrasive particle is predominantly diamond, the bonding matrix, when provided, preferably contains a solvent for diamond growth. Suitable solvents are metals of Group VIII of the Periodic Table such as cobalt, nickel or iron or an alloy containing such a metal. For diamond and cubic boron nitride compacts the presence of a solvent or catalyst for the particular abrasive being used in the compact is desirable because then under the conditions necessary for the manufacture of such compacts intergrowth between the particles occurs. As is known in the art, diamond and cubic boron nitride compacts are generally manufactured under conditions of temperature and pressure at which the abrasive particle is crystallographically stable.Abrasive compacts may be provided with a backing such as a cemented carbide backing in the manner described and illustrated in British patent specifications nos. 1,3493385, 1,407,393 and 1,489,130.According to the invention, there is provided an abrasive body comprising a support body of a high rigidity material which presents a major surface on each of opposite sides thereof and a thin continuous abrasive compact secured to the support body, the compact being located in a recess which extends around the entire periphery of at least one of the major surfaces of the support body and presents an exposed continuous abrading surface or edgeThe cross section of the compact will generally be less than 10 square millimeters in area. When the compact is rectangular or substantially rectangular in cross section, as will often be the case, the length and depth will each usually be no more than a few millimeters, e.g. each up to 4 millimeters.The body as a whole may also be thin i.e. having a depth of up to 10 millimeters.The support body may take a variety of shapes such as circular, triangular or rectangular in plan.The support body, which is obviously made of a material other than abrasive compact, is made of a high rigidity material such as hard steel or cemented carbide. Examples of suitable hard steels are those of the MandT series. Any cemented carbide knownn in the art may be used such as cemented tantalum, molybdenum,titanium or tungsten carbide. Cemented es, as is known in the art, contain the carbide particles and a bonding phase which is usually a transition metal such as cobalt, nickel or iron.The compact may be secured to the support body by means of brazing using rnQ sL le braze known in the art. The compact may also be clamped nnrt body. In this case, a plate which may be a metal plate will overlie a portion of the compact and will be secured to the support body. Securing of the plate to the support body may be achieved mechanically, e.g. nut and bolt, or by brazing.The abrasive compact may be any known in the art, but is preferably a diamond or cubic boron nitride compact.The compact may be used on its own or it may be provided with a cemented carbide backing.The abrasive body of the invention may be used for any abrading operation such as grinding, cutting, turning, drilling and the like. The bodies present a continuous, exposed cutting edge or surface of abrasive compact around the periphery. It is this edge or surface which does the abrading work. The use of expensive abrasive compact is thus reduced to a minimum.All that is required is a thin peripheral zone of compact unlike abrasive bodies of the prior art which require entire discs or segments of compact. Furthermore, the fact that the compact extends around the entire periphery of the body means that there is a large abrading edge or surface. When a portion of the edge or surface wears during use, the body is simply rotated to present a fresh edge or surface. The invention enables an abrasive compact, particularly when it has a disc shape, to be used to the full. For example, for disc shaped compacts, the compact may be fragmented into a number of concentric rings, each of which may be used in an abrasive body of the invention. Thus, from one such compact a plurality of abrasive bodies having a range of sizes may be produced. The production of a plurality of abrasive bodies having a range of sizes has particular application to cubic boron nitride compacts where large disc shaped cubic boron nitride compacts can be produced commercially.Embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference toFigures 1 to 4 of the accompanying drawing in which Figure 1 is a perspective view of an abrasive body,Figure 2 is a section along the line 2 2 of Figure 1,Figures 3 and 4 are each perspective views of further embodiments of abrasive bodies.Referring to Figures 1 and 2 there is shown an abrasive body consisting of a circular disc 10 of cemented tungsten carbide and a thin ring of abrasive compact 12 bonded to a cemented carbide backing 14. The ring of abrasive compact and backing is located in a recess 16 formed in the disc 10. The compact and backing are firmly bonded to the cemented carbide by brazing. The abrasive body may be used for a variety of abrading operations such as grinding, turning, cutting and drilling. It is the edge 18 of the compact which does the work.Referring now to Figure 3, there is shown an abrasive body consisting of a support body 20 and a compact ring 22 located in a peripheral recess formed in the body. The compact ring 22 is secured to the support body by means of a clamping plate 24 which itself is secured to the top surface 26 of the body 20 by brazing. Such securing can, of course, also be achieved by other means such as mechanically. The exposed edge 28 of the compact ring does the work during abrading operations. Referring to Figure 4, there is shown an abrasive body consisting of a support body 30 and an abrasive compact ring 32 located in a peripheral recess formed in the body. The compact ring is secured to the body by means of brazing. The body, as can be seen from Figure 4, is square in shape. It is the rounded edges 34 which usually do the abrading work in use. When one corner dulls, the body is rotated to present a fresh corner. The body is provided with a hole 36 by means of which it may be mounted for rotation. The longitudinal edge 38 is also available as an abrading edge.
