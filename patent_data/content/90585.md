# Rodent resistant non conductive optical fiber cable.

## Abstract
There is provided a cable 10 construction which resists attack by mammals fowl or fish. The cable construction consists of a core 12 containing at least one optical fiber 14 about which there is an organic cushion layer 20 , preferably polymeric in nature. About the cushion layer 20 there are a pair of counter helically wound resin impregnated inorganic fibers 22, 24 to provide tensile and hoop strength. About the pair of counter helically wound inorganic fibers there is provided one or more layer s of resin impregnated inorganic fibers 26, 28 helically wound to an angle greater than 60 , and preferably approaching 90 . These fibers when bitten provide needle like projections which irritate the mammal, e. g., rodent, fowl or fish and discour age any attempt to continue to attack the cable. The cable 10 is normally provided with an outer casing of a thermoplastic polymer for handling purposes. It may also include a layer containing abrasive materials which also deters attack by mammal, fowl or fish.
