# Noise reduction circuit for video signal.

## Abstract
A noise reduction circuit for video signal comprises a first stage noise eliminating circuit 10 21 for practically eliminating a noise component in the video signal, and a second stage noise eliminating circuit 21 10 for eliminating a noise component remaining in an output of the first stage noise eliminating circuit. A video signal which is obtained from the second stage noise eliminating circuit has also been eliminated of a noise component existing immediately after a rise in the video signal, and the output video signal of the second stage noise eliminating circuit has been substantially eliminated of all the noise component.
