# Method of preparing a microorganism, harboring a plasmid, with stabilized characteristics, and microorganism obtained in this manner.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method for stabilizing the characteristics of a microorganism harboring a certain plasmid. According to the invention a plasmid obtained from a microorganism of the genus Escherichia is inserted with a chromosomal DNA fragment controlling the independence of streptomycin and the obtained recombinant DNA is incorporated into a mutant of the genus Escherichia, which originally is dependent on streptomycin. By this method a streptomycin independent mutant of the said microorganism is obtained.
