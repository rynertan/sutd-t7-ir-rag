# Flow meter.

## Abstract
A flow meter suitable for the measurement of the mass flow rate of two phase flows. The flow meter has an S shaped flow tube 5 located within a housing 1 . The housing 1 has an inlet 2 and outlet 3 which are in register with the inlet and outlet of the flow tube 5 . The flow tube 5 has force transducers 7 fitted at the bends of the tube which measure the reaction forces during fluid flow and enable a mass flow reading to be obtained.
