## Description
PROCESS FOR POLYMERISING 1 OLEFINS The present invention relates to a process for polymerising l olefins. More particularly the invention relates to a process for polymerising l olefins, for example ethylene, using a modifiedPhillips catalyst. Phillips catalysts have been extensively described in the literature. They are formed by supporting chromium trioxide, or a compound calcinable thereto, on a refractory oxide support material, for example silica, alumina, zirconia, thoria or silica alumina and heating in a non reducing atmosphere, preferably an oxidising atmosphere to produce an active polymerisation catalyst. The produced catalyst is used to polymerise l olefins using tne so called solution form or particle form process.In the solution form process the monomeric l olefin which is normally ethylene or a mixture of ethylene with up to about 40 wt of other l olefins, is contacted with a suspension of the catalyst in a liquid hydrocarbon which is a solvent for the polymer at the polymerisation temperature employed. In the particle form process the monomeric l olefin is contacted with a suspension or a fluidised bed of the catalyst particles in a fluid medium under conditions such that the polymeric l olefin forms as solid particles suspended in or fluidised in the fluid medium. The fluid medium can be for example a liquid hydrocarbon or a gas. Examples of suitable liquid hydrocarbons are isobutane and n pentane.Examples of suitable gases are nitrogen or argon mixed with the gaseous monomer, or the undiluted gaseous monomer. UK patent specification 1,398,225 discloses a process for polymerising ethylene by contacting the ethylene in the presence of hydrogen and at a temperature lower than 100 C, with a catalyst produced by reacting one or more aluminium trialkyls with one or more conjugated dienes to form a polymeric organo aluminium compound which is then reacted with chromium VI oxide deposited on an inorganic carrier and which has been heated to a temperature of from 300 C to 1000 C. Japanese patent application 51 112890 discloses a catalyst for ethylene polymerisation comprising 1 chromium oxide supported on silica and 2 the reaction product between a diolefin and a compound AlR3 wherein R is hydrogen or hydrocarbon. Japanese patent application 50 45079 discloses a process for polymerising olefins in a hydrocarbon diluent in the presence of a catalyst comprising a mixture of an organic aluminium compound and chromium oxide supported on silica characterised in that a third component which is a non conjugated diene having the general formula R CH CH CH2 CH CH R is introduced, wherein R,R1 are hydrogen or alkyl. United States patent specification No 3,351,623 discloses a catalyst for polymerising ethylene at a temperature in the range 275 to 335 F, ie under solution form process conditions, the catalyst being one which forms on mixing 1 an oxide component selected from the group consisting of silica mixtures of silica and alumina containing up to 25 wt alumina and mixtures of chromium oxide and at least one material selected from the group consisting of silica, alumina, zirconia and thoria, at least part of the chromium being in the hexavalent state at the initial contacting of the monomer therewith, 2 an organo metal component of formula R M wherein R is selected x from the group consisting of hydrogen and alkyl, aryl, cycloalkyl, alkoxy radicals and combinations of these radicals containing up to 12 carbon atoms, at least one R group being a hydrocarbon radical M is selected from the group consisting of aluminium, gallium, indium, thallium, zinc, boron, lead, lithium, zirconium, cobalt, magnesium and tin and x is an integer equal to the valence of M, and 3 a vanadium component selected from the group consisting of vanadium chelates and vanadyl chelates.The catalyst system and polymerisation process of USP 3,351,623 are said to be applicable to the preparation of polyethylene and its copolymers which comprise greater than about 75 mole ethylene.Such copolymers can be prepared from monomer mixtures which contain 3 to 8 carbon containing l olefins such as propylene, l butene, l pentene, l hexene, 3 methyl pentene l, l octene and the like as well as conjugated olefins as butadiene and isoprene. USP 3,351,623 seeks to produce a catalyst that permits the use of high polymerisation temperature to obtain relatively low melt index polymer. It is not concerned with the use of low polymerisation temperatures below 2750F. Whilst the conventional particle form polymerisation process produces polyolefins suitable for many applications, there is a need for grades of polyolefins having a broad molecular weight distribution. It is an object of the present invention to provide a process for preparing polyethylene or ethylene copolymers having broad molecular weight distribution. Accordingly the present invention provides a process for polymerising ethylene or mixtures of ethylene together with up to 40 wt based on total monomer of one or more other l olefins copolymerisable therewith comprising contacting the monomer under particle form polymerisation conditions at a temperature not greater than 1120C with a catalyst A in the presence of a catalyst modifier B , said catalyst A having been prepared by supporting chromium trioxide, or a chromium compound calcinable thereto, on a refractory oxide support material and heating to a temperature at least sufficient to produce an active catalyst and said catalyst modifier B comprising 1 a trihydrocarbyl aluminium compound and 2 an aliphatic acyclic conjugated diene. The monomer employed in the process of the present invention is ethylene or a mixture of ethylene with up to 40 by weight of one or more other l olefins which are copolymerisable with the ethylene under the reaction conditions employed. Examples of suitable other l olefins are propylene, l butene, l pentene, l hexene and 4 methyl l pentene. The fluid medium employed in the particle form process conditions can be a liquid or a gas. Preferably it is a liquid. Examples of suitable liquid media are hydrocarbons which are chemically inert and non deleterious to the modified catalyst under the reaction conditions. Preferred liquid media are paraffins or cycloparaffins having from 3 30 carbon atoms per molecule, for example isopentane, isobutane, cyclohexane. Most preferably the liquid medium is i sobutane. When a liquid medium is employed in the process of the present invention preferably the concentration of monomer therein is in the range 2 10 wt ffi although concentrations outside this range can be employed if desired. The polymerisation temperature employed in the process of the present invention is suitably in the range 50 to 1120C, preferably Bo to 100C. The polymerisation pressure is preferably in the range 2 to 100 bar when the fluid medium is a liquid and 1 to 60 bar when the fluid medium is a gas. The residence or reaction time can vary from a few minutes to several hours and is generally in the range 15 minutes to 3 hours. The particle form process can be conducted under batch or continuous polymerisation conditions. Preferably the conditions are continuous. Preferred apparatus for conducting the reaction under continuous conditions in a liquid medium is described in UK Patent Specification 899,156. For further details of examples of particle form process conditions and apparatus which can suitably be employed in the present invention, reference may be made to UK patent specification Nos 899,156, 886,784 and 853,414. The chromium is introduced into the catalyst of the present invention by impregnating a refractory oxide support material with chromium trioxide or a compound calcinable thereto. Examples of suitable chromium compounds are chromium sesquioxide, chromic nitrate, chromic sulphate, chromic acetate, ammonium chromate, chromium carbonate, chromyl chloride and tertiary butyl chromate. Preferred are chromium trioxide itself, chromic acetate and tertiary butyl chromate.The quantity of chromium in the final catalyst is suitably in the range 0.2 to 30 wt , preferably 0.3 to 5.0 wt . Examples of suitable refractory oxides which can be employed in the process of the present invention are silica, alumina, zirconia, thoria or composites thereof, for example silica alumina. When the refractory oxide support material employed in the present invention is silica, it preferably has a mean particle diameter in the range 20 to 150 microns and a surface area in the range 150 to 800 square metres per gramme. The supporting of the chromium compound on the refractory oxide support material can be achieved, for example, by dissolving a soluble chromium compound in a volatile liquid impregnating the support material with the solution and evaporating the solvent by impregnating the support with a liquid chromium compound, eg chromyl chloride by passing the vapour of a volatile chromium compound, eg chromyl chloride, into a bed of the support material or by mixing together a finely divided chromium compound and the support material in the presence of a small quantity of solvent, the quantity being insufficient to cause substantial agglomeration of the support material, continuing the mixing until a substantially homogeneous mix is obtained and then evaporating the solvent.Examples of solutions that can be used to impregnate the support material are chromium trioxide water, ammonium chromate water, chromium acetate water, tertiary butyl chromate hexane, chromyl chloride chloroform. The temperature to which the supported chromium compound must be heated to form an active polymerisation catalyst hereinafter referred to as the activation temperature is at least 250 C and not higher than the temperature at which the support commences to sinter. Preferably the activation temperature is in the range 400 to 9000C, most preferably 500 to 8000C. In general, the higher the activation temperature employed within the aforementioned ranges, the lower becomes the average molecular weight of polyolefin produced over the catalyst.The heating time is suitably within the range 5 minutes to 24 hours, preferably 30 minutes to 15 hours although times outside the broader range can be employed if desired. It was formerly believed that to be an effective polymerisation catalyst a Phillips catalyst must contain at least some chromium in hexavalent form. Whilst it is true that most, if not all, Phillips catalysts do contain hexavalent chromium it is now believed that the olefin polymerisation catalysis may operate through chromium in valency states below 6. Nevertheless it is desirable during the heat activation of catalysts of this type, including the catalyst employed in the process of the present invention, that conditions which favour the formation of, or retention of, chromium in the higher valency states should be employed. The heat activation is preferably carried out in a non reducing atmosphere and most preferably in an oxidising atmosphere or in vacuo. Dry air is an example of a suitable oxidising atmosphere.The heat activation must be performed under anhydrous or dehydrating conditions and the activated catalyst must be protected from ingress of moisture. The catalyst modifier employed in the process of the present invention comprises two components 1 a trihydrocarbyl aluminium compound and 2 an aliphatic acyclic conjugated diene. The hydrocarbyl groups of the trihydrocarbyl aluminium compound are suitably alkyl, aryl, or alkaryl groups. The three groups attached to the aluminium atom may be the same or different.Preferably the hydrocarbyl groups are alkyl groups containing 1 to 10 carbon atoms, for example triethyl aluminium, triisobutyl aluminium or trioctyl aluminium. Triethyl aluminium is particularly preferred. The quantity of trihydrocarbyl aluminium compound employed in the present invention is suitably 0.1 to 20 moles and preferably 0.5 tolO moles per gram atom of chromium. Preferably, the quantity employed is in the range 0.1 to 2.0 millimoles per gram of catalyst A . The aliphatic conjugated diene or the present invention is preferably a diene having the general formula R1CH CR2CH CHR3 wherein RÚ, Rê and R can be the same or different and are hydrogen or alkyl groups containing 1 to 10 carbon atoms. The preferred dienes are butadiene and isoprene. The quantity of aliphatic conjugated diene employed in the present invention is suitably 10 to 5000 moles, preferably 100 to 1000 moles per gram atom of chromium in the catalyst. Preferably the quantity of conjugated diene is in the range 0.1 to 10 moles per 100 moles of monomeric l olefin employed. The trihydrocarbyl aluminium and the aliphatic conjugated diene employed in the present invention can be introduced into the polymerisation in admixture with or separately from the catalyst. If the polymerisation is conducted in a liquid medium the catalyst modifier ie the aluminium alkyl and the diene is preferably dissolved or suspended in some of this liquid prior to adding to the polymerisation vessel. If desired, the polymerisation process of the present invention can be conducted in the presence of hydrogen gas to lower the average molecular weight of the polymer produced. Methods of recovering polyolefins produced by the particle form polymerisation process of the present invention arc well known in the art. The present invention is particularly useful for making polyethylene or ethylene copolymers having broad molecular weight distribution, low melt index ie high average molecular weight and high density. The invention is illustrated in the following Examples wherein Examples 5 2 and 3 are according to the invention andExamples A and B are by way of comparison.Catalyst Preparation 320 kg of a commercial chromia on silica catalyst ID 969,W R Grace Co was heat activated in a 1.07 m diameter gas fired activator with a fluidising air flow of 91 mm s at about atmospheric pressure. The temperature of activation was held at 13500F 7320C for 5 hours. The catalyst recovery was 97 The activated catalyst contained 0.94 by weight chromium. After activation the catalyst was stored and handled in a dry nitrogen atmosphere.Polymerisation Bench scale polymerisation was carried out in a 2.3 litre stainless steel stirred autoclave. The reactor was purged with nitrogen, baked out for 2 hours at 110 C, then cooled to polymerisation temperature. Approximately 400 mg of the catalyst prepared as described above was charged to the reactor followed by the appropriate amounts see Table of triethylaluminium and diene the catalyst modifier components 4n a 1 litre of isobutane. The reactor temperature was maintained at polymerisation temperature and ethylene was added to bring the total pressure in the reactor to 41.4 bar. Ethylene was added continuously throughout the run to maintain this pressure. Polymerisation and polymer property data are shown in Table 1.

MI21.6 is the melt index measured by ASTM method 1238 using a 21.6 kg load. She units are grammes per 10 minutes. It can be seen from a comparison of Examples 1 and 2 with Example A that modification of the catalyst with trihydrocarbyl aluminium and conjugated diene gives polymer of higher d, that is, of broader molecular weight distribution, than modification of the catalyst with trihydrocarbyl aluminium alone.Example 3 The Phillips catalyst ID 969 activation was carried out in a similar manner to that described for Examples 1 and 2 except that an electrically heated activator of diameter 200 mm, a fluidising air flow of 45 mm s and an activation temperature of 5000C were used.The catalyst recovery was 85 . Bench reactor polymerisation was carried out as for Examples 1 and 2. Polymerisation and polymer property data are shown in Table 2. The results show that polymer of higher Kd, that is, broader molecular weight distribution, was produced over the Phillips catalyst modified with triechyl aluminium and butadiene this invention than over the same catalyst modified with triethyl aluminium and 1,4 hexadiene.
