## Description
PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION AND SEPARATION OF PARA XYLENE AND PARA XYLENE PREPARED BY THIS PROCESS The invention relates to a process for the preparation and separation of para xylene from a mixture substantially consisting of aromatic hydrocarbons with eight carbon atoms in the molecule. Para xylene is an important base material for the chemical industry, which is used on a large scale for the preparation of terephthalic acid. As a rule, the preparation starts from mixtures of aromatic hydrocarbons with eight carbon atoms in the molecule, which mixtures are obtained by applying a combination of distillation and selective extraction to hydrocarbon streams obtained in processing mineral oil or coal. In these mixtures para xylene is usually present together with the isomeric compounds ortho xylene, meta xylene and ethylbenzene.Since the four isomeric compounds resemble one another closely as regards physical and chemical properties, the separation of pure para xylene from these mixtures and from mixtures whose para xylene content has been increased by isomerization, presents a problem. In the past many methods have been proposed for the preparation and separation of para xylene from mixtures of aromatic hydrocarbons with eight carbon atoms in the molecule, but as a rule a para xylene so obtained is contaminated to a greater or less degree with one or more of the isomers. In an investigation by the Applicant concerning this subject it has been found that certain crystalline silicates which have been synthesized recently for the first time by the Applicant, are pre eminently suitable for use in a process for the preparation and separation of para xylene from the above mentioned mixtures. In fact it has been found that these crystalline silicates are capable not only of adsorbing very selectively para xylene and ethylbenzene from mixtures of the four isomers such as can be separated, for instance, in the processing of mineral oil or coal, but also of adsorbing very selectively para xylene from mixtures of the three xylenes obtained in the isomerization of a mixture of ortho xylene and meta xylene.The new crystalline silicates having these extraordinary properties are characterized as follows a they are thermally stable up to temperatures higher than 6000C, b they are, after dehydration at 400 C in vacuum, capable of adsorbing more than 3 w water at 250C and saturated water vapour pressure, and c in dehydrated form, they have the following overall composition, expressed in moles of the oxides 1.0 0.3 R 2 n0. a Fe2O3.b Al2O3.c Ga2O3 . y d SiO2.e GeO2 , where R one or more mono or bivalent cations, aa 0.1, b 0 cO, a b c 1 y w 10, d 0.1, e ,O d e 1, and n the valency of R. By using the above mentioned extraordinary properties of the crystalline silicates in two separate adsorption steps and combining these adsorption steps with an isomerization step applied to a mixture of ortho xylene and meta xylene and a crystallization step applied to a mixture of para xylene and ethylbenzene, the Applicant has succeeded in developing a process which can be used for preparing para xylene in high yield and separating it in a pure form from mixtures substantially consisting of aromatic hydrocarbons with eight carbon atoms in the molecule. The present patent application therefore relates to a process for the preparation and separation of para xylene from a mixture substantially consisting of aromatic hydrocarbons with eight carbon atoms in the molecule, in which the mixture is separated by adsorption into a mixture of para xylene and ethylbenzene and a mixture of ortho xylene and meta xylene, in which the para xylene is separated by crystallization from the mixture of para xylene andethylbenzene, in which the mixture of ortho xylene and meta xylene is isomerized, in which a further quantity of para xylene is separated from the isomerized product by adsorption, and in which use is made in both adsorption treatments of a crystalline silicate as adsorbent as defined hereinbefore. The process according to the invention is primarily intended for the preparation and separation of para xylene from mixtures of C8 aromatics. However, the process presents the additional possibility of separating a part of the ortho xylene and or meta xylene present in these mixtures and practically all of the ethylenebenzene present therein in a pure form. For the separation of part of the ortho xylene and or meta xylene from these mixtures, the non adsorbed mixture of ortho xylene and meta xylene from the first adsorption step is subjected to fractional distillation, in which the lower boiling meta xylene distils over first.In addition to the possibility of separating part of the ortho xylene and or meta xylene present in the starting mixture in a pure form by incorporating a distillation step between the first adsorption step and the isomerization step, the incorporation of this distillation step is also important for two other reasons. The first reason relates to the composition of the mixtures of C8 aromatics which are used as the feed in the process according to the invention. Besides the four isomeric C8 aromatic, these mixtures often also contain small quantities of aromatic hydrocarbons with 9 and more carbon atoms in the molecule.Like ortho xylene and meta xylene, these C9 aromatics are not adsorbed by the crystalline silicate and consequently find their way into the feed for the isomerization step.Incorporation of a distillation step after the first adsorption step has the advantage that these Cg aromatics are left as a bottom product in the distillation. The second reason why the inclusion of a distillation step before the isomerization step is important, relates to a special embodiment of the process according to the invention, in which non adsorbed product from the second adsorption step is recirculated to the isomerization step in order to increase the yield of para xylene.Owing to the occurrence of side reactions the product of the isomerization step often contains, in addition to the three isomeric xylenes, small quantities of other hydrocarbons as well, in particular Cg aromatics.Since these by products of the isomerization, just like ortho xylene and meta xylene, are not as a rule adsorbed by the crystalline silicate, they find their way into the recirculation stream to the isomerization step. Incorporation of a distillation step before the isomerization step has the advantage that these by products can be removed from the recirculation stream by passing the recirculation stream through this distillation step. As was mentioned hereinbefore, the process according to the invention, in addition to allowing the preparation and separation of the para xylene from mixtures of C8 aromatic, presents the possibility of separating practically all of the ethylbenzene present therein in a pure form. For the separation of ethylbenzene from these mixtures the noncrystallized material from the crystallization step is subjected to distillation.The ethylbenzene can thereby be distilled off in a pure form. To increase the yield of para xylene, the distillation residue containing paraxylene is preferably recirculated to the crystallization step in the process according to the invention. It may happen that in the treatment of the mixture of the three xylenes and ethylbenzene in the first adsorption step a small portion of the ortho xylene and or meta xylene is adsorbed as well. During the further processing of the adsorbed product from the first adsorption step, this ortho xylene and or meta xylene will eventually find its way into the distillation residue of the ethylbenzene recovery. To avoid a build up of ortho xylene and or meta xylene in the recirculation stream, the distillation residue in question is preferably recirculated to the first adsorption step instead of the crystallization step. The mixture of ethylbenzene, para xylene and, optionally, small quantities of ortho xylene and meta xylene from the crystallization step may very conveniently be used as the feed for an additional isomerization process for the preparation of para xylene. The ethylbenzene that can be separated in the process according to the invention, may be used as a gasoline component or as a base material for the chemical industry, for instance for the preparation of styrene. The process according to the invention comprises two separate adsorption steps with use of a crystalline silicate as the adsorbent. The adsorptions are carried out by contacting the feed at elevated temperature, for instance at a temperature between 25 and 2250C, with the adsorbent. The adsorbed compounds can be isolated from the adsorbent in various ways. Desorption may, for instance, be effected by heating the adsorbent, by reducing the pressure in the space in which the adsorbent is present or by treating the adsorbent with a suitable inert gas or a displacing agent. The process according to the invention further comprises a crystallization step. The crystallization is carried out by cooling the feed to a temperature which is sufficiently low for the crystallization to take place. Suitable temperatures lie between 15 and 800C. As a rule, the crystallization is started by seeding. The crystallization is preferably carried out in various steps. Finally, the process according to the invention comprises an isomerization step. The isomerization is carried out by contacting the feed at elevated temperature with an isomerization catalyst. The isomerization may be carried out both at atmospheric pressure and at elevated pressures up to about 150 bar. The isomerization is preferably carried out in the liquid phase at a temperature lower than 350 C and in the presence of 5 30 fiw and in particular of 15 25 w toluene added as diluent. As catalysts that may be used in the isomerization step according to the invention, all catalysts that are capable of effecting the desired conversion of ortho xylene and meta xylene into para xylene are in principle eligible. In the investigation concerning the preparation and separation of para xylene from mixtures of Cg aromatics the Applicant has found that the above mentioned crystalline silicates are not only very suitable for use as adsorbent in the separation of isomeric C8 aromatics, but that these crystalline silicates also show a high activity, selectivity and stability for catalysing the isomerization of ortho xylene and meta xylene into para xylene. In the process according to the invention it is therefore highly preferred to use such a crystalline silicate as catalyst in the isomerization step. In the process according to the invention it is preferred both for the two adsorption steps and for the isomerization step to use crystalline silicates which contain no gallium or germanium, in other words silicates of which, in the above mentioned overall composition, c and e are 0. Such silicates are the subject of Netherlands patent application No. 7613957. Further, preference is given to the use of silicates of which, in the above mentioned overall composition, a is greater than 0.5.Particular preference is given to silicates which contain no aluminium, in other words silicates of which, in the above mentioned overall composition, b is 0. It should be noted that in the silicates used in the process according to the invention, y is preferably less than 600 and in particular less than 300. Finally, in the process according to the invention preference is given to silicates whoseX ray powder diffraction pattern has, inter alia, the reflections mentioned in Table A of Netherlands patent application No. 7613957. The crystalline silicates which, in the process according to the invention, are used as adsorbent and, moreover, preferably as catalyst, are as a rule prepared from an aqueous mixture as the starting material which comprises the following compounds in a given ratio one or more compounds of an alkali metal, one or more compounds containing an organic cation or from which such a cation is formed during the preparation of the silicate, one or more silicon compounds, one or more iron compounds and, optionally, one or more aluminium, gallium and or germanium compounds. The preparation takes place by maintaining the mixture at elevated temperature until the silicate has been formed and subsequently separating the crystals of the silicate from the mother liquor. The silicates prepared in this way contain alkali metal ions and organic cations.Before being used in the process according to the invention, the organic cations which have been introduced during the preparation should be converted into hydrogen ions. Silicates for use as adsorbent in the process according to the invention preferably contain no hydrogen ions. Such silicates can be prepared from the above mentioned calcined silicates by ion exchange, for instance with an aqueous solution of a sodium salt, followed by calcining. Silicates for use as isomerization catalyst in the process according to the invention preferably have an alkali metal content less than 1 w and most preferably less than 0.05 fiw. Such silicates can be prepared from the above mentioned calcined silicates by ion exchange, for instance with an aqueous solution of an ammonium salt, followed by calcining. In the process according to the invention it is preferred to separate, in addition to para xylene, also ethylbenzene as the end product. As was already explained hereinbefore, pure ethylbenzene may be obtained as the distillate in the distillation of the non adsorbed product from the crystallization step. The residue obtained in this distillation is preferably recirculated to the crystallization step. In addition to para xylene, ortho xylene and meta xylene can also be separated as end products in the process according to the invention.As was already explained hereinbefore, pure ortho xylene and meta xylene can be obtained as the distillates in the distillation of the non adsorbed product from the first adsorption step. The non adsorbed product from the second adsorption step is preferably recirculated to the first adsorption step or to the distillation unit in which the non adsorbed product from the first adsorption step is distilled. The invention is now explained with the aid of the following example.Example Two crystalline silicates which were intended to be used in the process according to the present invention were prepared as follows.Silicate 1 A mixture of Fe N03 3,SiO2,NaN03 and J C3H7 4N tOH in water with the molar composition 0 8 C3H7 4N 20. 0.3 Na2O. Fe203. 200 SiO2. 55 H20 was heated for 48 hours in an autoclave at 1500C under autogenous pressure. After the reaction mixture had cooled down, the silicate formed was filtered off, washed with water until the pH of the wash water was about 8 and dried for two hours at 120 C. Silicate A thus prepared had an X ray powder diffraction pattern substantially as mentioned in Table B of Netherlands patent application No. 7613957.The silicate was thermally stable up to temperatures higher than 9000C and was, after dehydration at 400 C in vacuum, capable of adsorbing 7 w water at 250C and saturated water vapour pressure. From silicate A silicate 1 was prepared by, successively, calcining silicate A for four hours at 500 C, boiling with 1.0 molar NaNO3 solution, washing with water, boiling again with 1.0 NaNO3 solution and washing, drying for two hours at 1200C and calcining for four hours at 5000C. Silicate 1 thus prepared had the following chemical composition 2 Fe2O3. 200 SiO2. Silicate 2 Silicate B was prepared in substantially the same way as silicate A, the difference being, however, that in the present case the starting material was an aqueous mixture with the molar composition Na2O. 4.5 C3H7 N 20. Fe2O3. 29.1 Six2. 468 H20Silicate B thus prepared had the following chemical composition O.67 C3H7 4N720. 0.23 Na2O. Fe203. 30 Sit . 9 H O The silicate had an X ray powder diffraction pattern substantially as mentioned in Table B of Netherlands patent application No. 7613957.The silicate was thermally stable up to temperatures higher than 1000 C and was, after dehydration at 400 C in vacuum, capable of adsorbing 8 w water at 25 C and saturated water vapour pressure. From silicate B silicate 2 was prepared in substantially the same way as used in the preparation of silicate 1 from silicate A, the difference being, however, that in the present case an NH4NO3 solution was used nstead of an NaN03 solution.Preparation and separation of para xylene from a mixture of C8 aromatics A mixture of C8 aromatics comprising ortho xylene, meta xylene, para xylene and ethylbenzene in a weight ratio of 1 2 1 1 was separated by adsorption. To this end the mixture was passed across silicate 1 at 80 C, the silicate was desorbed with toluene and toluene was removed from the desorbate by distillation. In this way two mixtures of C8 aromatics were obtained, of which one mixture consisted of more than 99 fiw para xylene and ethylbenzene, the rest being ortho xylene and meta xylene, while the other mixture consisted of more than 99 fiw ortho xylene and meta xylene, the rest being para xylene.From the mixture of para xylene and ethylbenzene obtained as described above, in which these components were present in a weight ratio of about 1 1, a quantity of para xylene was separated by cooling down the mixture to a temperature of 600C. After sepa ration of the crystallized para xylene from the cooled mixture, a mixture resulted which consisted of more than 99 Sw para xylene and ethylbenzene, the rest being ortho xylene and meta xylene. In this mixture para xylene and ethylbenzene were present in a weight ratio of about 1 6.The mixture of ortho xylene and meta xylene obtained as described above, in which these components were present in a weight ratio of about 1 2, was isomerized. To this end the mixture was passed across silicate 2 at a temperature of 2500C and a space velocity of 1 l.l .h 1. From the isomerizate, which consisted of about 90 w of a mixture of the three isomeric xylenes, the rest being toluene and Cg aromatics which had been formed in the isomerization, para xylene was separated by adsorption. To this end the isomerizate, in which ortho xylene, meta xylene and para xylene were present in a weight ratio of about 1 2 1, was passed across silicate 1 at 800C, the silicate was desorbed with toluene and toluene was removed from the desorbate by distillation.In this way a quantity of para xylene was obtained and a mixture resulted which consisted of about 95 fiw ortho xylene and meta xylene, the rest being Cg aromatics.In this mixture ortho xylene and meta xylene were present in a weight ratio of about 1 2.
