## Description
CONTROL OF ECTOPARASITES The present invention relates to novel pro panedione derivatives, their preparation and use in the control of ectoparasites. The control of ectoparasites, such as fleas, ticks, biting flies and the like, has long been recognized as an important problem in animal husbandry. The traditional treatments for domestic animals were topically applied insecticides, such as the famous dips for sheep. Indeed, such treatments are still in wide use. However, the more modern thrust of research has been towards compounds which can be administered to the animals, especially orally, and which will control ectoparasites by poisoning the parasite when it ingests the blood of the treated animal. South African Patent 71 4221 discloses the insecticidal activity of 1,3 propanediones having a trifluoromethyl group on one carbonyl, and a substituted phenyl group on the other carbonyl. Ectoparasiticidal use of some of their compounds is also disclosed. Canadian Patent No. 862,068 illustrates a group of 1,3 propanediones, having a phenyl or naphthyl group on one carbonyl and a perhalomethyl or perhaloethyl group on the other carbonyl. These compounds are said to be insecticides but there is no reference to the treatment of animals. U.S. Patent No. 3,636,214 describes 1,3 propanediones having an aryl group1 including a thienyl group, on one carbonyl, and a trifluoromethyl or other haloalkyl group on the other carbonyl. However, this document describes the use of such compounds only for the purpose of controlling fungi, especially in the soil. The present invention provides a method of controlling a population of insect or acarina ectoparasites which consume blood of a host animal which comprises administering to the host animal an effective amount of a compound of the formula I R CO CH2 CO R1 I wherein R is phenyl or thienyl substituted by halo, trifluoromethyl, nitro, chloroethenyl or bromoethenyl R1is C3 C6 perfluoroalkyl or perfluorocycloalkyl or a sodium, potassium or lithium salt thereof. Preferably, the R group has one or two substituents. The compounds of formula I , except the free form of those where R is 5 bromo or 5 chloro thien 2 yl and R1 is C3 perfluoroalkyl, are novel and are provided in one aspect of the invention. Throughout the present document, all temperatures are expressed in degrees Celsius. All expressions of percentage, concentration and the like are in weight units unless otherwise described. The term halo refers to fluoro, chloro, bromo or iodo. The term 11chloroethenyl11 or bromoethenyl refers to an ethenyl group substituted with one or two chlorine or bromine atoms, respectively, on the terminal carbon atom. The terms perfluoroalkyl and perfluoro cycloalkyl refer to alkyl or cycloalkyl groups in which all of the hydrogen atoms have been replaced by fluorine atoms. The term is used to avoid the long chemical names that result from naming the locations of the individual fluorine atoms. Thus, the Ri groups of the compounds used in the present invention include perfluoroalkyl and perfluorocycloalkyl groups such as perfluoropropyl, perfluoroisopropyl, perfluoroisopentyl, perfluoro 2 methylpentyl , perfluorocyclopropyl, perfluorocyclohexyl and the like. R is preferably optionally substituted phenyl, and the preferred R1 group is C3 perfluoroalkyl. While the compounds used in the present invention are consistently named as 1,3 propanediones in the present document, it will be understood that it is guite possible if not probable that one of the carbonyl groups will actually be in the enol form. That is to say, the compound will exist in a form described as follows. R CO CH C OH R1 Indeed, it is most probable that the compounds exist in an equilibrium form containing some of the diketone and some of the enol at all times. A careful study of the equilibrium has not been carried out, and so the compounds will be described here as diketones in all cases. It will be understood by the skilled reader that the principles and function of the present invention remain the same, whether carried out with the diketone, with pure enol, or with an equili brium mixture of the diketone and the corresponding enol. It is believed that the nature of the compounds used in the present invention has been made entirely clear. However, to assure that the reader fully comprehends the invention, a group of exemplary compounds will be mentioned here. 1 4 chloro 3 iodophenyl 3 perfluoropropyl 1,3 propanedione 1 3 bromo 5 fluorophenyl 3 perfluoroiso propyl 1,3 propanedione 1 2 fluoro 4 trifluoromethylphenyl 3 per fluorocyclohexyl 1,3 propanedione 1 3 fluorophenyl 3 perfluorobutyl l, 3 propanedione 1 5 nitrothien 2 yl 3 perfluorocyclopentyl 1,3 propanedione 1 4 chloro 5 iodothien 3 yl 3 perfluoro cyclopentyl 1,3 propanedione 1 2 fluoro 5 trifluoromethylthien 3 yl 3 perfluoro 1 methylpropyl 1,3 propanedione 1 3 nitro 5 trifluoromethylphenyl 3 per fluorocyclopropyl l, 3 propanedione 1 3 2,2 dibromoethenyl phenyl 3 perfluoro cyclobutyl 1,3 propanedione 1 4 2,2 dichloroethenyl phenyl 3 perfluoro pentyl 1,3 propanedione 1 2 chloro 4 2,2 dichloroethenyl phenyl 3 perfluoro 2 ethylbutyl 1,3 propanedione 1 4 bromo 3 2,2 dibromoethenyl thien 2 yl 3 perfluoro 1 methylpentyl 1,3 propanedione 1 2,4 diiodophenyl 3 perfluorocyclopropyl 1,3 propanedione 1 2, 5 difluorophenyl 3 perfluorocyclopropyl 1,3 propanedione, potassium salt 1 2,6 dinitrophenyl 3 perfluoro t butyl 1,3 propanedione, sodium salt 1 2,4 bis trifluoromethyl phenyl 3 perfluoro pentyl 1,3 propanedione, sodium salt 1 4,5 difluorothien 2 yl 3 perfluoro 3 methylbutyl 1,3 propanedione, lithium salt 1 3 ,4 diiodothien 2 yl 3 perfluorocyclo propyl 1,3 propanedione, potassium salt 1 3,5 bis trifluoromethyl thien 2 yl 3 perfluorocyclobutyl 1,3 propanedione, lithium salt 1 2, 5 dinitrothien 3 yl perfluoropentyl 1,3 propanedione, sodium salt 1 5 nitro 3 trifluoromethylthien 2 yl 3 perfluorohexyl 1,3 propanedione, potassium salt 1 3 chloro 4 nitrothien 2 yl 3 perfluoro propyl 1,3 propanedione, sodium salt 1 4 chloro 3 nitrophenyl 3 perfluoropropyl 1,3 propanedione, potassium salt. The most preferred compounds for use in the present invention are the following. l perfluoropropyl 3 3 trifluoromethylphenyl 1,3 propanedione 1 perfluoropropyl 3 2,4 difluorophenyl 1,3 propanedione 1 4 chlorophenyl 3 perfluoropropyl 1,3 propanedione 1 perfluoropropyl 3 4 trifluoromethylphenyl 1,3 propanedione Use of the above particularly preferred compounds in the form of their salts, especially the sodium salt, is also particularly preferred. According to one aspect of the invention there is provided a method for preparing a compound of formula I , which comprises a compound of formula R CO CH3 II with an activated form of the acid of formula R1CO2H III in the presence of a base strong enough to generate the anion of the compound of formula II . The activated form of the acid will normally be a C14 alkyl ester of formula R1 CO2R3 where R3 is C14 alkyl, preferably ethyl. However, acid halides or acid anhydrides can also be used. As stated above the acylation should be car ruled out in the presence of a base strong enough to generate the anion of the acetyl derivative. Suitable bases which may be mentioned are Group fA hydrides such as sodium hydride, or Group IA alkoxides such as sodium methoxide or ethoxide. The product of the acylation reaction will be a salt of the compound of formula I with the base utilised in the acylation reaction. The propanedione may be produced in free form by reaction of that salt with a strong acid such as hydrochloric acid. The acylation reaction should be effected at a temperature within the range from 0 to 1000C, preferably from OOC to room temperature, in an inert organic solvent such as toluene or diethyl ether. When a perfluorocycloalkyl compound is to be made, a preferred synthesis proceeds through a perfluoroalkyl, preferably trifluoromethyl, compound in the alkali metal salt form. That compound is contacted with a strong base, such as sodium hydride, to form an anion, which is reacted with the acid fluoride of the desired perfluorocycloalkyl carboxylic acid. The reaction is readily carried out at ambient or moderately elevated temperature, as Example 5 illustrates. Thus, during the above described reaction, the anion R CO CH COR4 is generated, wherein R4 represents C1 C4 perfluoroalkyl, preferably trifluoromethyl. This anion then reacts with the acid fluoride of formula R1COF where R1 represents a C3 C6 perfluoroalkyl group, to form a compound of formula EMI8.1 Hydrolysis of this product with an aqueous mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid yields a compound of formula I in which R1 is C3 C6 perfluoroalkyl. The compounds used in the present invention are highly acidic in nature and readily form alkali metal salts. Therefore, the products of the abovedescribed process are routinely obtained in the salt form. When the free acid form is desired, however, it is necessary only to take the product through an acidic step as the reaction mixture is being worked up. For example, a brief wash with a dilute strong acid, such as dilute hydrochloric acid, readily converts a salt to the free acid. The following preparative examples are given to assure that the reader can obtain any desired compound for use in the present invention.

Parasitic insects and acarina include species that are bloodsucking as well as flesh eating and are parasitic during all of their life cycle or only part of their life cycle, such as only the larval or only the adult stage. Representative species include the following horse fly Tabanus spp. stable fly Stomoxys calcitrans black fly Simulium spp. horse sucking louse Haematopinus asini mange mite Sarcoptes scabiei scab mite Psoroptes equi horn fly Haematobia irritans cattle biting louse Bovicola bovis shortnosed cattle louse Haematopinus eurysternus longnosed cattle louse Linognathus vituli tsetse fly Glossina spp. cattle follicle mite Demodex bovis cattle tick Boophilus microplus and B. decoloratus Gulf Coast tick Amblyomma maculatum Lone Star tick Amblyomma americanum ear tick Otobius megnini Rocky Mountain wood tick Dermacentor andersoni screwworm fly Cochliomyia hominivorax assassin bug Reduvius spp.mosquito Culiseta inornata brown ear tick Rhipicephalus appendiculatusAfrican red tick Rhipicephalus evertsi bont tick Amblyomma sp. bont legged tick Hyalomma sp.hog louse Haematopinus suis chigoe Tunga penetrans body louse Haematopinus ovillus foot louse Linognathus pedalis sheep ked Melophagus ovine sheep scab mite Psoroptes ovis greenbottle fly Phaenicia sericata black blow fly Phormia retina secondary screw worm Cochliomyia macellaria sheep blow fly Phaenicia cuprina bed bug Cimex lectulariusSouthern chicken flea Echidnophaga gallinacea fowl tick Argas persicus chicken mite Dermanyssus gallinae scalyleg mite Knemidokoptes mutans depluming mite Knemidokoptes gallinae dog follicle mite Demodex canis dog flea Ctenocephalis canisAmerican dog tick Dermacentor variabilis brown dog tick Rhipicephalus sanguineous The method of the invention may be used to protect economic and companion animals from ectoparasites.For example, the compounds may beneficially be administered to horses, cattle, sheep, pigs, goats, dogs, cats and the like, as well as to exotic animals such as camels, llamas, deer and other species which are commonly referred to as wild animals. The compounds may also beneficially be administered to poultry and other birds, such as turkeys, chickens, ducks and the like.Preferably, the method is applied to economic animals, and most preferably to cattle and sheep. The rate, timing, and manner of effective application will vary widely with the identity of the parasite, the degree of parasiticidal attack, and other factors. Applications can be made periodically over the entire lifespan of the host, or for only a peak season of parasitic attack. In general, ectoparasite control is obtained with topical application of liquid formulations containing from about 0.00005 to 5.0 of compound, and preferably from about 0.00005 to about 1.0 of compound.Effective parasite control is achieved at administration rates of from about 5 to about 100 mg. kg. The compounds are applied to host animals by conventional veterinary practices. Usually, the compounds are formulated into ectoparasiticidal compositions which comprise a compound and a physiologicallyacceptable carrier. For example, liquid compositions may be simply sprayed on the animals for which ectoparasiticidal control is desired. The animals may also treat themselves by such devices as back rubbers, which may contain the toxicant compound in a cloth, for example, which the animal may walk against and contact.Dip tanks are also employed to administer the active agent to. the host animal. The present compounds display systemic ectoparasiticidal activity. The compounds have the ability to permeate the tissues of a host animal to which one of the compounds has been administered. Insect parasites which then consume blood or other living tissues of the host animal are thereby killed. The compounds are administered by dermal, oral or percutaneous routes and are preferably formulated prior to administration. Such formulations are well known to those skilled in the art, for example by dissolving the compound in one of many physiologically acceptable adjuvants or diluents. Oral administration may be performed by mixing the compound in the animals feed or drinking water, or by administering dosage forms such as tablets, capsules, boluses, or implants.Percutaneous administration is conveniently accomplished by subcutaneous, intraperitoneal and intravenous injection of an injectable formulation. The compounds can be formulated for oral administration in the usual forms, such as drenches, tablets, or capsules. Such compositions, of course, require orally acceptable inert carriers. The compounds can also be formulated as an injectable solution or suspension, for subcutaneous, dermal, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, or intravenous injection. In some applications, the compounds are conveniently formulated as one component of a standard animal feed.In this embodiment, it is usual to formulate the present compound first as a premix in which the compound is dispersed in a liquid or particulate solid carrier. The premix can contain from about 2 to 250 grams of compound per pound. The premix is in turn formulated into the ultimate feed by conventional mixing. Since ectoparasitic attack generally takes place during a substantial portion of the host animal s lifespan, it is preferred to administer the compounds of the present invention in a form to provide sustained release over a period of time. Conventional procedures include the use of a matrix which physically inhibits dissolution, where the matrix is a waxy semisolid such as the vegetable waxes or a high molecular weight polyethylene glycol. A good way to administer the compounds is by means of a sustained action bolus, such as those of Laby, U.S. Patent 4,251,506, and Eli Lilly Co.,British Patent 2,059,767. For such a bolus, the compound would be encapsulated in a polymeric matrix such as that of Nevin, U.S. Patent 4,273,920.Sustained release of the compounds of the present invention can also be achieved by the use of an implant such as from a silicone containing rubber. The following exemplary compositions illustrate the sort of formulations used to practice the method of the present invention.
