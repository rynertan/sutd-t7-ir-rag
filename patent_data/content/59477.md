# Apparatus for loading objects.

## Abstract
An apparatus for loading objects on a pallet has a first horizontal frame structure 6 movable vertically relative to an upright support 1 . The first frame structure 6 supports a second horizontal frame 13 which is movable horizontally in respect to the first frame structure 6 . The second frame 13 supports a carriage 18 which is horizontally movable relative to said second frame 13 in a direction perpendicular to the horizontal movement of the second frame 13 and is provided with an angularly movable catching element 23 such that said catching element by the displacement of the second frame 13 in one horizontal direction and the displacement of the carriage 18 in a horizontal direction perpendicular thereto may be located over an object located at a loading area 5 within the area of said first frame structure 1 , then lowering said first frame structure 6 and activating the catching element 23 , elevating said first frame structure 6 and displacing the second frame 13 and the carriage 18 to the desired unloading position. If necessary the catching element 23 is then angularly shifted and finally the first frame 6 is lowered and the catching element 23 de activated.
