# Composite material reinforced with alumina silica fibers including mullite crystalline form.

## Abstract
This composite material includes reinforcing alumina silica fiber material in a metal matrix. The alumina silica reinforcing fibers have principal components about 35 to about 65 by weight of SiO₂, about 35 to about 65 by weight of Al₂O₃, and a content of other substances of less than or equal to about 10 by weight, with the weight percentage of the mullite crystalline form therein being at least about 15 , and with the weight percentage of included non fibrous particles with diameter greater than or equal to 150 microns being not more than about 5 . And the matrix metal is selected from the group consisting of aluminum, magnesium, copper, zinc, lead, tin, and alloys having these as principal components. The volume proportion of the alumina silica fibers should be at least 0.5 . Within these constraints, the qualities of the composite material with regard to wear, and wear on a mating member, and hardness, bending strength, and tensile strength, are good.
