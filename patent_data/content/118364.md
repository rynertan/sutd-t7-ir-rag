## Description
IMMUNOSTIMULATORY DIPEPTIDYL D GLUCOSE DERIVATIVESAND METHODS OF PREPARATIONBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION One of the most active immunoadjuvants isFreund s Complete Adjuvant which is a water oil emulsion consisting of 10 Arlacel A and 90 mineral oil containing whole killed mycobacterial cells. A vaccine is formulated with Freund1s Complete Adjuvant by incorporating the antigen in the aqueous phase.Therapeutic applications of Freund s CompleteAdjuvant, however, have been prevented due to accompanying toxic side effects such as local granulomas, endotoxic shock, and adjuvant induced polyarthritis. Subsequently, the minimal active structure of mycobacteria has been determined byEllouz et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 59, 1317 . 1974 and by Kotani et al., Biken J., 18, 105 1975 to be a peptidoglycan fragment of the cell wall, more specifically, a muramyl dipeptide, namely,N acetylmuramyl L alanyl D isoglutamine MDP . The addition of synthetic MDP to an emulsion of Freund s incomplete adjuvant 90 mineral oil and 10 ArlacelA containing an antigen increases the level of antibodies against the antigen humoral response and induces delayed hypersensitivity cellular immunity .OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide biologically active dipeptidyl D glucose derivatives having immunostimulatory properties.Another object is to provide methods for the preparation of these compounds. A further object is to provide formulations for incorporating these dipeptidyl saccharides into a vaccine. These and other objects of the present invention will be apparent from the following description.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Compounds of the general formula EMI2.1 wherein R1, R2 and R3 are independently H orEMI3.1 or an alooxycarbonyl group of the formula EMI3.2 wherein R10 is C1 50 alkyl 1 or 2 adamantyl or 3 cholesteryl R5 is H or C1 10 alkyl provided that when R5 is C1 10 alkyl, the stereochemistry at chiral center I is either D or L R6 is H or R6 R7 together is CH2 CH2 CH2 R7 is H, C17 alkyl, hydroxymethyl, mercaptomethyl, benzyl or hydroxybenzyl provided that when R7 is not H, the stereochemistry at chiral center II is R8 and R9 are independently COOR or CONR R wherein R is H or C17 alkyl, and R and Rw are independently H or C13 alkyl the stereochemistry at chiral center III is always D. The compounds in the present invention possess immunostimulatory properties and may be used as immunological adjuvants to stimulate the host immune response. They are especially useful for increasing the antigenicity of weakly immunogenic agents in vaccines against bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections or against various tissue antigens of normal or pathogenic origin. They can be used in place of whole killed mycobacterial cells in Freund s Complete Adjuvant. In addition, the compounds of the present invention when incorporated into a vaccine either as an aqueous or oil formulation lack the deleterious side effects observed in vaccine compositions containing Freund sComplete Adjuvant.Furthermore, the compounds of the present invention by themselves provide non specific host protection against infectious organisms, for example, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Candida albicans,Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.They are also capable of potentiating antibiotic activity. The obtained compounds can be transformed to their salts in a classical fashion, for example, by reacting the acidic compounds obtained with alkaline or alkaline earth hydroxides or the basic compounds with acids. The present invention is also directed to pharmaceutical preparations that contain a compound of formula 1. Among the pharmaceutical preparations relevant to this invention are salts that are administered by external route, for example, orally, rectally or parenterally to mammalian species.Preparations may be administered that contain the pharmacologically active compound by itself or mixed with a pharmacologically acceptable carrier. The dose of the pharmacologically active compound depends on the animal specie, the age, and the state of the individual and the mode of application. The new pharmaceutical preparations contain from about 10 to about 95 and, preferably from about 20 to about 90 of a compound of the present invention. The pharmaceutical preparation relevant to this invention can be presented, for example, in the form of unit doses like tablets, capsules, suppositories, and ampoules. The immunostimulatory properties of the compounds in the present invention can be demonstrated with the following protocols 1. In vivo Stimulation of Humoral Response Increase in the Production of Antibodies Against Bovine Serum Albumin BSA in the Mouse Mice NMRI are immunized by i.p. injections of 10 mg of BSA without precipitate. At 0, 9, 15 and 29 days later, blood samples are taken and analyzed for anti BSA antibody titers by the passive hemaglutination technique. At the dose utilized, soluble BSA is subimmunogenic for the receiving animals, that is, it does not cause any antibody production, or at most a completely insignificant production. Additional treatment of the mice with certain immunostimulants before or after administration of antigen leads to an increase in antibody titer in the serum.The effect of the treatment is expressed by the obtained score, that is, the sum of the logs to the base 2 of the differences of the titer at 3 days of bleeding. The compounds of the present invention are capable of augmenting in a significant manner the production of anti BSA antibodies by i.p. or subcutaneous application s.c. of 100 300 mg kg animal during 5 consecutive days day 0 to day 4 after immunization with BSA. The immunostimulatory effect of the compounds mentioned herein depend on the antigen, contrary to other bacterial immunostimulants like LPS of E. coli . The injection of the compounds of the present invention results in augmentation of anti BSA antibody titer only in mice immunized withBSA, and not with non immunized mice. Subcutaneous administration is as efficacious as i.p., that is, the immunostimulatory effect observed is systemic and does not depend on the fact that the stimulant was administered by the same route as the antigen or mixed with it, as is the case with classical adjuvants. The compounds of the present invention permit specific augmentation of humoral immunity, improve immune response, and provide long lasting immunostimulatory effects on systemic activation of the immune apparatus. 2. Stimulation of Mitotic Responses of Lymphocyte Cultures Mouse lymphoid cells are cultured in microtiter plates, in RpsI l640 medium with 2 fetal calf serum. Cultures are set in triplicates and consist of 3 5x105 spleen or 1.5X106 thymus cells per well in a final volume of 0.2 ml. Class specific mitogens are added at optimal or suboptimal concentrations, while control cultures are incubated without mitogens. The tested compounds are added shortly after the mitogens and the cultures are incubated for 48 hours at 370 with 5 CO2. Incorporation of tritiated thymidine is determined after a pulse 1.0 Ci well during the last 6 hours in culture. The data are recorded as mean cpm and the effects of the compounds are presented as stimulation index mean cpm in cultures with the compound mean cpm in control . The compounds of the present invention enhance the levels of thymidine incorporation in lymphocyte cultures, with or without mitogens. The stimulation indices are maximal in control cultures or in those with suboptimal doses of mitogens.Similar effects of the compound are provoked in cultures of different lymphocyte populations, namely,B cells nude spleen , T cells thymus or their mixtures normal spleen . The effects of the compounds are dose dependent. These compounds, therefore, are capable of stimulating proliferation of lymphocytes that participate in the humoral response B cells as well as in cellular immunity T cells . 3. In Vivo Immunopotentiation Against Challenge with Lethal Doses of Pseudomonas aerusinosa Protection is expressed as increased relative numbers of LD50 s 50 lethal doses .Zymosan is used as an internal positive control. All mice CF1 are immunocompromised on day 4 with 250 mg kg body weight of Cyclophosphamide, followed by injection of test compounds at least two hours later on day 4 . On day 0, mice are challenged with lethal doses of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All injections are intraperitoneal, and test compounds are injected only once day 4 . The compounds of the present invention reverse the suppression induced with cyclophosphamide and are thus potent stimulants of host resistance. 3. Compatibility Although the compounds of the present invention produce their stimulatory effect with guinea pigs, for example, beginning with a single dose of 0.05 mg kg s.c., and with mice after 5 applications of 10 mg kg s.c., no toxic effect is observed after 5 applications of 300 mg kg i.p., with the mouse. These compounds possess, therefore, a remarkable therapeutic index. The compounds of the present invention thus have the capacity, on the one hand, of being mixed with an antigen for which an increase in immunogenicity is required and on the other hand, by systemic application, of increasing the immunological reactivity of the treated organism. Moreover, these compounds can enhance cellular as well as humoral immunity and activate lymphocytes responsible for the formation of antibodies. The compounds of the present invention can consequently be employed as 1 adjuvants by mixing them with vaccines with the goal of improving the effectiveness of the vaccination and 2 protective agents against infections caused by bacteria, viruses or pathogenic parasites, owing to immunity by humoral antibodies and or to cellular mediation. Thus, the described compounds are indicated, mixed with the most varied antigens, as adjuvants for experimental as well as industrial production of antisera for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes, as well as to induce immunologically active lymphocyte populations at the time of cell transfers. Moreover, one can equally utilize the new compounds without simultaneously supplying antigen in order to enhance immune reactions that are already taking place in a subliminal fashion in a mammalian host. These compounds are therefore especially indicated for stimulation of individual immune defense, e.g., at the time of chronic or acute infections or in cases of selective antigenspecific immunological deficiencies as well as in situations of immunedeficiency, but also acquired general deficiency i.e., not antigen specific as appears with age, during initial shock from a grave illnesst and before and soon after radiation therapy or immunosuppressive hormones.The said compounds can subsequently be administered in combination with anti infectious antibiotics, chemical therapeutics or other methods of treatment, to combat immunological deficiencies. The described compounds are thus indicated equally for general prophylaxis of infectious disease in man and animal. Intermediates for the compounds of Formula I may be prepared by condensing, using conventional procedures, a protected compound of Formula II with a protected compound of Formula III.EMI9.1 In the foregoing Formulas, R5 , R6, R7,R8 and Rg represent the groups mentioned above, while Ra and R8 are optionally substituted alkylidene radicals that block the oxygen atoms at the C 1 C 2 and the C 5 C 6 positions, respectively. Among the alkylidene radicals, particularly suitable are the lower alkylidene radicals, especially ethylidene, isopropylidene, propylidene, or cycloalkylidene, especially cyclopentylidene, or cyclohexylidene, and also, the optionally substituted benzylidene radical, preferentially substituted at the para position. As protecting group for the carboxyl in the dipeptide ofFormula III, there may be mentioned tertiary butyl, benzyl, or benzhydryl.The protecting group may be any suitable to protect the group to which it is attached during the condensation reaction, and which may be readily removed thereafter. The condensation is effected by reacting the compound of Formula II in the form where the carboxylic acid is activated, with the amino compound of Formula III. The activated carboxyl group may be, for example, an acid anhydride, preferably, a mixed acid anhydride like an acetate of the acid, an amide of the acid like an imidasolid, an isoxazolid or an activated ester.The activated esters, include the cyanomethyl ester, the carboxylmethyl ester, the p nitrophenyl thioester, the p nitrophenyl ester, the 2,4, 5 trichlorophenyl ester, the pentachlorophenyl ester, the N hydroxyphthalimide ester, the 8 hydroxy quinoline ester, the 2 hydroxy 1,2 dihydro l carboethoxyquinoline esters, the N hydroxypiperidine ester or enol ester derived from N ethyl 5 phenyl iseazolium 3 sulfonate, The activated esters may equally be obtained from a carbodiimide by addition of N hydroxysuccinimide or from a substituted I hydroxybenzyltriazole for example, a halogen, methyl, or methoxy substituted 3 hydroxy 4 oxo 3,4 dihydrobenzo d 1,2, 3 triazine. The amino group may be activated, for example, by reaction with a phosphitamide. Among the methods of reaction with the activated esters, one must mention in particular those that involve N ethyl 5 phenyl isoxazolium 3 sulfonate Woodward s Reagent K , N ethoxy carbonyl 2 ethoxy l, 2 dihydroquinoline, or carbodiimide. The starting materials utilized are known or can be made in a known fashion. Thus, one can obtain compounds of Formula II, for example, by reacting the corresponding sugar unsubstituted at position 3 with a halogen R5 acetic acid where R5 has the meaning mentioned above. The ether is obtained in the presence of a strong base. The halogen is preferentially bromo or chloro. Another process of synthesizing intermediates for the compounds of Formula I consists of condensation of a protected compound of Formula IV EMI11.1 wherein R5, R6, R7, Ra, and Rss have the meaning mentioned above, with a compound of Formula V EMI12.1 wherein R8 and R9 have the meaning mentioned above. The condensation may be effected by reacting a compound of Formula IV in the form of an activated carboxylic acid, with the amino compound of FormulaV, or by reacting the Formula IV compound in the form of the free C terminal carboxyl group with theFormula V compound where the amino group is present in activated form. The activated carboxyl group can be, for example, an acid anhydride and preferably a mixed acid anhydride, an acid amide or an activated ester. Among these, one finds in particular the acid anhydrides, the amides, or the esters mentioned above. The amino group may be activated, for example, by reaction with a phosphitamide. The readily removable protecting groups correspond to those mentioned above. The starting materials are obtained in classical fashion. One can, therefore, react the corresponding sugar unsubstituted at position 3 with halogen R5 acetamido R7 acetic acid or a compound of Formula II with an amino R7 acetic acid where the carboxyl group is blocked as mentioned above. Another process for inserting the side chain at position 3 of the sugar radical consists in reacting a compound having the following structure EMI13.1 where Rcz and Rss have the meaning mentioned above, with a compound of formula VIZ EMI13.2 where Z represents an esterified hydroxy group capable of reacting and wherein R5, R6, R7, R8 and Rg have the meaning given above. An esterified hydroxy group capable of reacting is, first of all, a hydroxy group esterified with a strong inorganic or organic acid and especially a group esterified by the hydrohalic acids, like hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, or hydroiodic acid. The protecting groups correspond to those already mentioned above. The starting materials utilized are known or can be made in a known fashion. Condensations of a protected compounds ofFormula IT with a protected compound of Formula III b protected compound of Formula IV with a protected compound of Formula Vt or c a protected compound ofFormula VI with a protected compound of Formula VII, afford intermediates of Formula VIII EMI14.1 wherein R5, R6, R7, R8, Rg, Ra and have the meaning mentioned above. Intermediates of Formula VIII are converted into compounds of Formula I by selective removal of selective acylation of the C 6 hydroxyl, and in the case where R1, R2 and R3 is hydrogen, removal of Ra and final removal of the remaining protecting groups by hydrogenolysis with hydrogen in the presence of a noble metal catalyst. In the case where R1, R2 and R3 are acetyl, after selective acylation of the C 6 hydroxyl and removal of the C l, C 2, and C 4 hydroxyls are acetylated and remaining protecting groups are removed by hydrogenolysis with hydrogen in the presence of a noble metal catalyst. RB is selectively removed by mild acid hydrolysis to give intermediates of Formula IX, which is effected in a classical fashion, for example, with aqueous acetic acid at mild temperatures 20 500C . EMI15.1 The compounds of Formula I are then prepared by reaction of the intermediates of Formula IX described above with the appropriate acylating agent whereby condensation takes place preferentially at the 6 position of the glucofuranose ring. The condensation reactions may be carried out in accordance with procedures well established in the art for preparing organic compounds. Thus, the condensation may be carried out using the alkyl chloroformate in the presence of an acid acceptor, such as pyridine, 4 dimethylaminopyridine, or triethylamine. The reaction is carried out in an inert aprotic solvent, such as dichloromethane, chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, or pyridine, at a temperature of from 0 to 500C for from 1 hour to 6 days. Once the condensation reaction has been completed, Ra is removed by acid hydrolysis to give intermediates of Formula X, which is effected in a classical fashion, for example, with acidic ion exchange resins, in particular, with an exchange resin containing sulfonic acid groups, e.g. AmberliteIR 120 resins of styrene containing strongly acidic sulfonyl groups or Dowex 50 polystyrene sulfonic acids or with a strong inorganic or organic acid, e.g. hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, a sulfonic acid, e.g. methanesulfonic acid, a phenylsulfonic acid optionally substituted in its aromatic nucleus, e.g. p toluenesulfonic acid, or a carboxylic acid, e.g. acetic acid or trifluoroacetic acid EMI16.1 wherein R4 is an acoxycarbonyl group as defined above and R5, Rg, R7, R8 and Rg have the meaning mentioned above. Remaining protecting groups are readily removed by hydrogenolysis, preferably carried out with a catalyst such as palladium oxide or palladium on charcoal in a solvent such as glacial acetic acid or an alcoholic solvent such as methanol or ethanol. In the case where R1, R2, and R3 in formula I are acetyl, intermediates of formula X are acetylated with acetic anhydride or acetyl chloride in the presence of an acid acceptor, such as pyridine, 4 dimethylaminopyridine, or triethylamine.Remaining protecting groups are removed by hydrogenolysis, preferably carried out with a catalyst such as palladium oxide or palladium oncharcoal in a solvent such as glacial acetic acid or an alcoholic solvent such as methanol or ethanol. Compounds wherein R7 is other than methyl, may be obtained when, for example, one of the following amino acids is substituted for alanine Amino Acid R6 serine CH2OH cysteine CH2SH phenylalanine benzyl tyrosine p hydroxybenzyl valine isopropyl leucine 2 methylpropyl isoleucine l methylpropyl a aminobutyric CH 2CH3 norvaline CH2CH2CH3 norleucine CH2CH2CH2CH3 Compounds wherein R6 and R7 together are CH2CH2CH2 are obtained by substituting proline for alanine.
