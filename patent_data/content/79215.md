# Process for preparation of coated oriented plastic container.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a process for the preparation of a coated oriented plastic container, which comprises coating an aqueous latex or organic solvent solution of a vinylidene chloride copolymer on at least one surface of a parison, preform or sheet for formation of container which is formed by hot molding of a molecularly orientable thermoplastic resin, drying the coated parison, preform or sheet to form a coating layer, and subjecting the formed coated structure to draw molding such as biaxial draw blow molding or draw forming, wherein the coating layer of the vinylidene chloride copolymer is crystallized at the step of forming the coating layer or the draw molding step. In the coated oriented plastic container prepared accord ing to this process, the adhesion of the coating layer of the vinylidene chloride copolymer to the plastic container subs trate is highly improved, and even under severe conditions, peeling of the coating layer is prevented. Moreover, the gas barrier property, strength and chemical resistance of the container are prominently improved.
