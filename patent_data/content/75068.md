# NECKED IN CONTAINER BODY AND APPARATUS FOR AND METHOD OF FORMING SAME

## Abstract
This invention relates to the necking in of a free end portion of a container, and particularly a very thin wall can body, utilizing necking in tooling. The tooling differs from conventional tooling in that in addition to the necking in operation, it also serves radially inwardly to turn the free edge portion of the container body to facilitate leading in of the necked in portion into another tubular container com ponent with the in turned free edge portion also providing a section modulus which effects stiffening and form retain ing of the free end portion.
