# Phase stable compositions containing a paraffinic polyol and an isocyanate reactive prepolymer.

## Abstract
Phase stable compositions containing a paraffinic polyol chain extender, e.g., 1,4 butanediol, and an isocyanate reactive prepolymer containing hydroxy and epoxy groups are formed by heating the polyol and prepolymer in the presence of one another to yield the phase stable composi tion. The composition, when reacted with a polyisocyanate, yields poly oxazolidone urethane thermoset compositions.
