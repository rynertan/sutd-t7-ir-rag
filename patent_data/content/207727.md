# A PROCESS FOR RECOVERING GLUCAGON FROM PANCREAS GLANDS

## Abstract
There is provided a process for the purification of gluca gon from a glucagon salt cake containing pancreas gland sourced glucagon, which comprises 1 dissolving said glucagon salt cake in an aqueous medium containing a water miscible organic solvent 2 contacting the glucagon salt cake solution with a hyd rophobic adsorption support at a pH less than about 4 or greater than about 7.5 and at conditions under which the glucagon is adsorbed on said hydrophobic adsorption sup port 3 eluting glucagon from said hydrophobic adsorption support with an aqueous solution containing a water miscible organic solvent to obtain a first glucagon containing solution 4 contacting a solution containing glucagon eluted from said hydrophobic adsorption support, said solution having a pH of from about 7.5 to about 10.5, with an anion exchange support at conditions under which the glucagon is adsorbed on said anion exchange support 5 eluting glucagon from said anion exchange support to obtain a second glucagon containing solution and 6 recovering glucagon having increased purity.
