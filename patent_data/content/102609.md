# Digital analog converter.

## Abstract
A digital analog converter characterized in that reference voltage is divided by a first string like resistor array 11, 105, 202 , whose two adjacent outputs are selected by a first switch array 13, 107, 204 depending upon the contents of upper bits of a digital signal and applied to the both ends of a second string like resistor array 17, 110, 211 , and one of switches in a second switch array 18, 113, 214 is selectively turned on responsive to the contents of lower bits of said digital signal to pick up one of the divided voltages of said second resistor array 17, 112, 211 .
