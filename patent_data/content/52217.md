# Process for stabilizing by encapsulation red phosphorus to be used as flame retardant of polymeric materials and product so obtained.

## Abstract
A process for stabilizing by encapsulation red phosphor us in powder for using it as flame retardant for polymeric materials, consisting in preparing a red phosphorus disper sion in an aqueous solution of a melamine condensate cationized with a mineral acid, consisting of melamine, formaldehyde, triethanolamine and a monohydroxyl alcohol having a number of carbon atoms lower than 5, in heating the aforesaid dispersion, under stirring, at 80 100 C in order to precipitate said condensate in the form of a melaminic resin partially cross linked around the individual red phos phorus particles which are so stabilized by a continuous and compact layer of said resin, then in completing the cross linking of same in a final dehydration step by drying at 80 130 C.
