# Arrangement for coupling an implement to a tractor.

## Abstract
Arrangement for coupling an implement to a hydrauli cally operated coupling device on a tractor, said arrange ment comprising a coupling frame male part attached to the tractor and cooperating with a coupling frame female part attached to the implement, said arrangement when coupled together providing a power transmitting union. Power transmission is effected via an upper union where the coupling beams 26 of the female part straddle the corres ponding guide beams 22 of the male part, and by two lower coupling devices consisting of catch hooks 21 on the male part and interacting coupling hooks 35 on the female part. The coupling members 21 and 35 are locked and released by a separate spring loaded latch 26 provided with an indicating lever 30 to which an operating mechanism 31 has been attached.
