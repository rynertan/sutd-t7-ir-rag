# Herbicidal compositions and their use to control undesirable weeds.

## Abstract
Herbicidal compositions containing the DPE CHEM together with one or more of dicamba, mecoprop and ioxynil show a surprising herbicidal effect, especially on weeds commonly found amongst cereal crops. The ioxynil can be partly or completely replaced by bromoxynil and the mecocrop can be partly or completely replaced by dichloroprop and or MCPA. Useful commercial ratios of DPE ioxynil and or bromoxynil are 20 to 30 200 to 400, of DPE mecoprop and or dichloroprop and or MCPA are 20 to 60 800 to 1600 and of DPE dicamba are 30 to 60 45 to 75. Methods of controlling the growth of weeds wherein the compositions are applied to growing weeds or to a growth medium prior to weed emergence are also disclosed.

## Description
HERBICIDAL COMPOSITIONS AND THEIR USE TO CONTROLUNDESIRABLE WEEDS.This invention is concerned with herbicidal compositions and their use to control undesirable weeds. The compositions of the invention comprise mixtures of known herbicides which mixtures surprisingly demonstrate synergistic herbicidal effect over the individual herbicides on certain weeds commonly found amongst cereal crops.The compoundEMI1.1 is a diphenylether herbicide mentioned among many others inEuropean Patent Application No. 0020052 which also describes its preparation and herbicidal efficacy, formulations containing it and Procedures for applying it as a herbicide.We have now surprisingly found that this particular diphenylether, which for convenience we will refer hereinafter as DPE, demonstrates a synergistic herbicidal effect when used in herbicidal compositions in conjunction with a limited number of other herbicides which, in contrast to DPE are of known commercial activity. The preferred among these other herbicides are a dicamba which has the chemical names 3,6 dichloro O anisic acid by IUPAC and 3,6 dichloro 2 methoxybenzoic acid by CA usage and b mecoprop which is 2 4 chloro O tolyloxy propionic acid by IUPAC . The terms ndicambaM and mecoprop as used herein also includes salts and esters of the parent acids, such as the potassium and amine salts of dicamba and the potassium and amine salts of mecoprop and esters of mecoprop.Another, but less preferred, other herbicide is ioxynil which is 4 hydroxy 3,5 di iodobenzonitrate by IUPA . The term ioxynil as used herein also includes salts of the parent phenolic compound e.g. the alkali metal salts and amine salts and ester octanoate.Also useful are compositions in which the herbicides other than DPE are wholly, or preferably partially, replaced by other herbicides of the same family and or with which they are known to be efficacious when used in combination on weeds in cereal crops. For example mecoprop is a member of the aryloxypropionic acid family of herbicides which also includes dichloroprop and similar herbicides such as 2 4MCPA. Further ioxynil is a representative of benzonitrile herbicides including bromoxynil with which ioxynil is often combined in use. Dicamba is often used in combination with 2,4 D and 2,4 MCPA. Further the herbicides dicamba, mecoprop and ioxynil are known useful as mixtures of two or more of them sometimes with one or more of the other herbicides uust renti√èned, e.g. a mixture of mecoprop, dicamba and bromoxynil.Such mixtures are also encompassed within this invention when they further include DPE.The mixtures of the invention contain the herbicides in the following exemplary active ingredient ratios by weight.DPE ioxynil 10 to 120 200 to 400, preferably 10 to 60 200 to 300 more preferably 20 to 60 200 to 300, most preferably 20 to 30 200 to 300. A useful commercial ratio would be 20 to 30 200 to 400.DPE mecoprop 10 to 120 500 to 2000, preferably 10 to 60 500 to 2000 more preferably 20 to 60 500 to 1000. A useful commercial ratio would be 20 to 60 800 to 1600.DPE dicamba 10 to 120 30 to 120, preferably 10 to 60 30 to 120, more preferably 30 to 60 30 to 120. A useful commercial ratio would be 30 to 60 45 to 75.Advantage may be taken of the noted synergism in two ways.The mixtures may be used in the above weight ratios but in total doses grams active ingredient per hectare less that those hitherto used to give control to weeds at reduced cost.Alternatively use of the active ingredients at doses grams hectare according to the ratios of active ingredients given above will give enhanced weed control.The compositions of the invention are useful as postemergence herbicides on cereal crops, although in the cases of maize and sorghum directed spray application to minimise contact with the crop itself is recommended. They may also be used to control weeds in crop free ground prior to sowing which may take place two to four months later. This is especially useful when the crop to be sowed requires an undisturbed root system for best yield. One example is sunflower.In its broadest aspect therefore the invention comprises herbicidal compositions comprising DPE together with one or more of dicamba, mecoprop and ioxynil with the proviso that instead of ioxynil bromoxynil may be used and instead of mecoprop dichloroprop and or MCPA may be used. The compositions may also include other herbicides such as are known to be useful with one or more of dicamba, mecoprop, ioxynil, bromoxynil, dichloroprop and or MCPA. Dichloroprop is 2 2,4 dichlorophenoxy propionic acid and is frequently used as an alkali metal, particularly potassium, or amine salt.MCPA is 4 chloro O tolyloxy acetic acid and is frequently used as a salt particularly the sodium salt, or as an ester.Bromoxynil is 3,5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzonitrile and is frequently used as an alkali metal salt or as octanoate ester. 2,4 D is 2,4 dichloro phenoxy acetic acid and is often used as the amine salt.In all of these cases use of the common name herein is intended to include the useful salts and or esters. The compositions will usually be used in conjunction with an agronomically acceptable carrier or diluent and optionally a surfactant so as to provide a herbicidal composition which, in general, will contain from 0.1 to 99.9 more usually 1 to 99 and even more usually 5 to 95 by weight of active herbicidal components.These herbicidal compositions may be in the form of ready for use dusts, aqueous emulsions, suspensions, granules or pellets alternatively they may be in the form of concentrated solutions, wettable powders, water dispersible granules, flowable liquid suspensions, pastes or dust concentrates each for dilution with, as the case may be, water or finely divided solids to give diluted aqueous solutions, suspensions, emulsions, or dusts which are then directly usable as herbicidal compositions. It is important that the amount of organic solvent in ready to use liquid formulations be kept very low for application on cereal crops and emulsifiable concentrates and flowable emulsion concentrates are of interest only in this context for dilution with water.By the term agronomically acceptable carrier or diluent as used above is meant a substance which can be utilized to dissolve, disperse, diffuse or otherwise dilute the active ingredient without impairing the effectiveness of the active ingredient and which does no permanent damage to such loci as soil, equipment and agronomic crops. It is usually desirable in post emergence application to include adjuvants, such as wetting agents, spreading agents, dispersing agents, stickers, adhesives, and the like, in accordance with known agricultural practices. Examples of adjuvants which are commonly used in the art can be found in tr Oohn w. McCuzcheon, inc. publication Detergents and Emulsifiers 1969 Annual .Wettable powders or dispersible granules or flowable formulation suitable for spaying, can be prepared by aamlxlng the compound with a finel divided solid, such as clays, inorganic silicates and carbonates, and silicas and then incorporating wetting agents, sticking agents, and or dispersing agents. The concentration of active ingredients in such fcrmulations is typically in the range of from about 20 to about 98 by weight, and, preferably, from about 40 to about 75 by weight. A dispersing agent can constitute about 0.5 to about 38 by weight of the composition, and a wetting agent can constitute from about 0.18 to about 5 by weight of the composition. Dusts can be prepared by mixing the herbicides with finely divide inert solids which may be organic or inorganic in nature. Materials useful for this purpose include, for example, botanical flours, silicas, silicates, carbonates and clays. One convenient method of preparing a dust is to dilute a wettable powder with a finely divided carrier.Dust concentrates containing from about 20 to about 80 by weight of the active ingredient are commonly made and are subsequently diluted to about 1 to about 10 by weight use concentration.The herbicides can also be mixed with fertilizers or fertilizing materials before their application. In one type of solid fertilizing composition in which the diphenyl ethers can be used, particles of a fertilizer or fertilizing ingredients, such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, or ammonium phosphate, can be coated with one or more of the ethers. The solid herbicides diphenyl and solid fertilizing material can also be admixed in mixing or blending equipment, or they can be incorporated with fertilizers in granular formulations. Any relative proportion of herbicide and fertilizer car. be used which is suitable for the crops ana weeds to be treated. rle her cide will commonly be present in an amount from about 5 to about 25 by weight of the fertilizing composition.These compositions provide fertilizIng r.ateri2is which roro te the rapid growth of desired plants, and at the same time control the growth of undesired plants. The herbicides can be applied as herbicidal sprays by methods commonly employed, such as conventional high gallonage hydraulic sprays, low gallonage sprays1 airblast spray, aerial sprays and dusts. For low volume applications a solution of the compound is usually used. The dilution and rate cf application will usually depend upon such factors as the type of equipment employed, the method cf application, the area to be treated and the type and stage cf development of the weeds.The application cf the herbicidal compositions to cereals, especially, wheat, barley and rye can be by conventional methods. In the case of maize and sorghum directed spray application is recommended. The mixtures of the invention can be formed in situ by sequential application of the active herbicidal components. Weeds most commonly found in such cereal crops include weeds of the Botanical species Polygonium, Matricaria andStellaria and the following Examples demonstrate synergism in respect of these weeds. In none of the exemplified field tests was undue phytotoxicity of the crop winter wheat evident.ExamplesFormulationsA.

After the sowing the soils were maintained moist by regular watering at a temperature cf from 8 to 12 C. The herbicides were sprayed in a carrier liquid when the weeds had attained the two to four leaf stage Trite liquid volume used was 300 litres per hectare and the doses of each active ingredient in grams per hectare were 25 indicated in the following Tables.The composition sprayed was formulated from a wettable powder containing 5 by weight of the DPE and wettable powders of mecoprop as the bu. lglyccl ester and of ioxynil as the octanoate each containing 25 by weight of the active ingredient. The dicamba was incorporated from a 500 grams per litre aqueous solution of its amine salt. The spray composition was made by the usual tank mix procedures that is to say that the wettable powders were r,ixed Fnto a thick paste with water and or the dicamba solution when appropriate, and this paste was then extended with more water to form a sprayable dispersion.To demonstrate synergism each pot was sown with three species of weeds. Three pots were left untreated with herbicide, three pots were treated with a mixture of the two herbicides as indicated and each of three pots were treated only with the individual herbicides. The pots were observed for four weeks after the treatment and the weed populations counted two weeks after the treatment. The results and further details of the tests are given inTables 1 and 2 hereinafter.Field TrialsField trials were carried out in up to three different locations on plots two metres by ten metres in area sown with winter wheat and beaning weeds as indicated in TablesIII to V hereinafter, with adjacent control plots and with two repetitions. The herbicides were applied by liquid suspension, made as in the pot trials, at a rate of 600 litres per hectare.Application of the herbicides was carried out at id tillering stage 3 to 4 on the Large scale, Plant Pathology 1954 Volume 3 pages 128 to 129 .As in the pot trials, the plots were observed over a period of four weeks and the weed counts taken two weeks after treatment.The results and further details of the treatment are given in tables III to V hereinafter. Svnerqism The results are expressed as a percentage of weeds destroyed in two ways the actual observed percentage R and the calculated percentage C on the basis of the herbicidal activity measured when each of the two herbicides was used individually on the basis of the Limpel fcrmula C X Y XY in which X equals weed destroyed by 100 the first herbicide alone Y weeds destroyed by the second herbicide alone C weeds expected to be destroyed by the combination of the two herbicides assuming no synergism. When the difference between R and C is positive synergism is demonstrated. If it is negative antagonism is demonstrated. Support for this basis of measurement of synergism is to be found in the articles by Limpel, Schulot and Lamont, 1962, Proc. NEW cc, Volume 16 pages 48 to 53 and Colby, Weeds, January 1967 pages 20 to 22.
