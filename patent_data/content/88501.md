# Laser pipe welder cutter.

## Abstract
A laser pipe welder cutter for use where a pipe 20 to be welded or cut cannot be rotated, consisting of a focusing head 1 mounted on a carriage 2 which runs on a track 3 surrounding a hole 4 in a base plate 5 through which a section of pipe 20 to be operated upon can project. The focusing head is arranged to maintain the laser beam at normal incidence to the pipe 20 as it traverses around the pipe 20 and is linked to a laser source via a flexible laser beam guide 8 which consists of at least two rigid sections 10 joined by optical elbow joints 11, 12, 13 which permit motion about two mutually perpendicular axes, the lengths of the rigid sections 10 being such that the laser focusing head 4 can traverse more than a full circle around the pipe 20 without the rigid sections 10 of the laser beam guide 8 coming into contact with the pipe 20 .
