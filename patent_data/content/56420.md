## Description
OPHTHALMIC GELMost ophthalmic medicaments are topically administered to the eye. The most common dosage form for such medicaments is liquid drops. The liquid drop form is easy to apply, but suffers from the inherent disadvantage that the drug it contains is rapidly washed from the precorneal ocular cavity by tear flow. Thus, a continued sustained drug level is not obtained. Sustained levels are typically attained by periodic application of the drops, but this results in frequent administrations by the patient. The result of frequent administration and washing by tear flow is that the level of medication surges to a peak at the time the drops are applied, then the drug concentration falls rapidly.Other methods of applying ophthalmic medicaments are the unitary ocular inserts. While such inserts deliver the drug in a sustained manner, they suffer from the disadvantages of being difficult to insert and remove, and are expensive.The prior art discloses a polyvinyl alcohol boric acidiodine complex useful in the treatment of eye infec tions. Klin.Oczna., 36 1 , 27 32 1966 , C.A.67 72I4OI4r. However, the researchers concluded that the complex must be maintained at a pH of 5.0 5.5 to afford stability of the iodine. At this pH, the complex is a conventional solution dosage form. Also, this pH is not compatible for use with injured eyes.A high viscosity gel containing pilocarpine has been described as being useful in topical treatment of increased intraocular pressure American Journal ofOphthalmology 88, 843 846, 1979 , however, no details about the pilocarpine gel are disclosed.The present invention relates to a topical ophthalmic gel for use in the eyes of human and domestic animals comprising 0.05 10 preferably 0.05 2. by weight of at least one ophthalmic medicament, 1 3 by weight of a polyvinyl alcohol of the grades 20 to 100, with a molecular weight of over 10,000 and a viscosity rating of 5 to 65 centipoises measured in 4 aqueous solution at 200C , 0.1 1 by weight of a borate gelling agent and 85 99 sterile water said gel being maintained at a pH of 6.5 8.5, preferably 6.98.5.This ophthalmic gel is a long acting, topical medicament which has a pH that is compatible with even injured eyes.Because the polyvinyl alcohol gel is formed with the medicament already in solution the medicament is uniformly dispersed and consequently the medicament has more uniform release characteristics over a longer period of time than ophthalmic medicaments known in the art.Thus the gel of this invention has an improved biological response and an increased duration of activity. This medicament also provides a dosage form which is more convenient and less messy to use than conventional eye drops. Additionally, the gel is selfdissolving, that is, the tear flow gradually dissolves the gel without leaving a residue. As is described further below in detail the shelf life of the gel of this invention is at least 1 to 3 years.If the gel contains an active ingredient which is not sufficiently stable at the pH of 6.5 to 8.5 the components of the composition are kept in appropriate combination in two separate containers and the desired medicament is prepared by mixing these components shortly before the treatment is started. Ophthalmic drugs suitable for incorporation into the gel of the present invention include, but are not limited to, antibiotics such as tetracycline, chlortetracycline, bacitracin, neomycin, polymixin, gramicidin, oxytetracycline, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, sisomicin, penicillin, netilmicin, rosaramicin and erythromycin antibacterials such as sulfonamides, sulfacetamide, sulfamethizole and sulfisoxazole antivirals such as idoxuridine and vidarabine other antibacterial agents such as nitrofurazone and sodium propionate antiallergenics such as antazoline, methapyriline, chlorpheniramine, pyrilamine and prophenpyridamine anti inflammatories such as hydrocortisone, hydrocortisone acetate, dexamethasone, dexamethasone 21 phosphate, fluocinoline, medrysone, prednisolone, methyl prednisolone, prednisolone 21 phosphate, prednisolone acetate, fluorometholone, betamethasone, betamethasone valerate, triamcinolone, indomethacin and flunixin decongestants such as phenylephrine, naphazoline, and tetrahydrozoline miotics and anticholinesterases such as pilocarpine, eserine salicylate, carbachol, di isopropyl fluorophosphate, phospholine iodide, and demecarium bromide mydriatics such as atropine sulfate, cyclopentolate, homatropine, scopolamine, tropicamide, eucatropine and hydroxyamphetamine and sympathomimetics such as epinephrine.The ophthalmic drug may be in formulation in its base form, or, optionally in a salt form. Where a salt form is utilized the salt may be any eye compatible, pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt. Such salts can be derived from a variety of organic and inorganic acids such as sulfuric, phosphoric, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydriodic, sulfamic, citric, lactic, maleic, malic, succinic, tartaric, cinnamic, acetic, benzoic, gluconic, ascorbic, and nitric.Preferred salts are those utilized in the U.S. Pharmacopeia, XIX edition, given for each individual drug.For instance, atropine is conventionally and preferably formulated as the sulfate, homatropine as the hydrobromide, pilocarpine as the hydrochloride or the nitrate, epinephrine as the bitartrate, physostigmine as the salicylate or sulfate, flunixin as the N methyl glucamine, gentamicin as the sulfate, and so on.For example, a preferred gel contains a combination of betamethasone phosphate and gentamicin sulfate.The polyvinyl alcohol suitable for use in the present invention is typically of the grades of 20 to 100, with a molecular weight of over 10,000 and a viscosity rating of 5 to 65 centipoises measured in 4 aqueous solution at 200C . A preferred polyvinyl alcohol isGelvatol 20 90 Monsanto having a viscosity of 35 to 45 centipoises measured in 11 aqueous solution at 200C , and a molecular weight of approximately 125,000.The gelling agent utilized in this invention to effect formation of the gel may be any of the borate salts such as sodium borate, potassium borate, calcium borate or magnesium borate. Preferably, sodium or potassium borate is used. Alternatively, the borate may be generated in situ by the reaction of boric acid with aqueous alkali.This is particularly advantageous in the instance where it is desirable to package the components of the gel, i.e., polyvinyl alcohol solution and the borate solution separately. The boric acid may be present in the polyvinyl alcohol solution without effecting formation of the gel. Upon addition of a second solution containing aqueous alkali, the gelling occurs.Suitable aqueous alkali solutions for use in combination with the boric acid include, but are not limited to, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate. Sodium hydroxide is preferred for use in the invention.Suitable buffering agents for use in the present invention are those which are typically used in ophthalmic medicinals. Included, but not limited are buffering combinations such as boric acid sodium acetate and preferably boric acid sodium borate.Other salts useful in buffer combinations include sodium and potassium bicarbonate, potassium carbonate and sodium citrate. Most preferably, the amounts of the buffer s components are adjusted so as to afford a final pH of about 7.4. Specifically the amount of buffer can range from about 0.1 to 5 , preferably 0.1 to 1 , wherein percentages are by weight based upon the total weight of the overall composition. The ratio of the components is balanced to provide the desired pH for the overall composition.The gel is usually adjusted in a conventional manner so as to provide an isotonic gel, i.e., a gel wherein the sodium chloride equivalent is about 0.9 by weight of the gel. Preferably, sodium chloride is utilized to adjust the percentage of salt components. The medicated gel of the present invention may be optionally preserved by the addition of conventional levels of ophthalmic preservatives such as benzalkonium chloride 0.013 , benzethonium chloride 0.01 , phenylmercuric acetate 0.004 , phenylmercuric nitrate 0.004 , chlorobutanol 0.5 , ss phenylethyl alcohol 0.5 or thiomersal, 0.01 .The ophthalmic medicament is present in the medicated gel in amounts ranging from about 0.05 10 by weight.Particularly suitable amounts for incorporation for the individual drug may be determined by reference to the U.S. Pharmacopeia, XIX edition 1970 ,Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences, 14th edition 1970 , or Goodman and Gilman, The PharmacologicalBasis of Therapeutics, 5th ed., 1976 .Typical preferred gels contain the ophthalmic medicament in the amounts given in Table I below. Table I Drug Preferred Concentra tion Range In Antazoline Phosphate 0.25 0.5Atropine Sulfate 0.5 4.0Benoxinate Hydrochloride 0.2 0.4 Table I continued Betamethasone Phosphate 0.05 0.5Carbachol 0.75 3.0 Cocaine Hydrochloride 2.0 4.0Cyclopentolate Hydrochloride 0.5 2.0Epinephrine Bitartrate 1.0 2.0Fluorescein Sodium 1.0 2.0Flunixin NMG N methyl glucamine 0.5 2.0Gentamicin Sulfate 0.1 0.5Homatropine Hydrobromide 2.0 5.0Hydroxyamphetamine Hydrobromide 0.2 1.0Idoxuridine 0.05 0.1Lidocaine Hydrochloride 1.0 4.0Neostigmine Bromide 1.2 2.5Phenylephrine Hydrochloride 0.1 2.5Physostigmine Salicylate 0.25 0.5Physostigmine Sulfate 0.25 0.5Pilocarpine Hydrochloride 0.25 5.0Pilocarpine Nitrate 0.5 3.0Scopolamine Hydrobromide 0.2 0.5Tetracaine Hydrochloride 0.25 0.5Vidarabine 1.Q 3.0Optionally, the gel of the present invention may also contain up to 1 of a conventional eye compatible stabilizing agent. Suitable stabilizing agents for use in the present invention include, but are not limited to, EDTA, sodium bisulfite, sodium metabisulfite, and thiourea. Most preferably, the stabilizing agent is present in an amount of 0.1 0.2 by weight of the gel.The gel of the present invention has a shelf life which is dependent upon the particular ophthalmic drug incorporated therein. In the case of drugs which are normally stable in solution of pH 7 9, the usual shelf life of the gel of this invention is at least 1 3 years. For instance, gentamicin sulfate may be formulated into a gel with a shelf life of at least 2 years,For drugs which are most stable at lower pH s e.g., 4 7, the shelf life of the gel after formulation is about 3 12 months. For instance, pilocarpine is most stable at a pH of about 4.5 to 5.5. The pH is not suitable for use in the eye since to minimize irritation the pH should preferably be about 6 to 8 and most preferably about 7.4.As noted by Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences, 14th edition, p. 1553, pilocarpine hydrochloride solutions have been shown to need a minimum pH of 6.8 for reasonable eye comfort. However, at a pH of 6.8, the time for 50 decomposition of pilocarpine at 25 0C is 66 days. At elevated tempera 0 tures 120 C 50 decomposition of pilocarpine in a solution of this pH occurs in about 34 minutes. At a pH of 6.8, pilocarpine is obviously not stable enough for normal shelf life or for autoclaving. Thus, the use of pilocarpine ophthalmic solutions at a pH of 6.8 or above is usually limited to situations where it is possible to constantly prepare fresh solutions of the eye drops for use by the patient by sterile filtration, and have an expiration date of 1 month to take care of the shelf life problem.Alternatively, a solution having a pH of about 5 is utilized with a long expiration date but which may not be used in cases where the eye has been injured.To obviate such problems, a gel containing pilocarpine or a salt thereof would be prepared by the dispensing pharmacist just prior to purchase by the patient.Thus, as a preferred embodiment of our invention, the gel is prepared by mixing a sterile solution of the pilocarpine or salt thereof and the polyvinyl alcohol with a sterile, aqueous solution of the borate gelling agent. The pilocarpine polyvinyl alcohol solution is maintained at a pH of about 4 5 to maintain the stability of the pilocarpine. This pH may be obtained by dissolving the pilocarpine salt in water or, if necessary due to the presence of other excipients, by the addition of a suitable buffer. The borate gelling agent solution contains sufficient buffers so that when the two solutions are mixed to form the gel, the resultant.pH will be 6.5 8.5. Depending on the nature of the pilocarpine polyvinyl alcohol solution, the borate gelling agent solution may or may not require additive buffers to attain this pH. Other medicaments can be stored and prepared in an analogous way. It is useful to supply these medicaments in a kit of parts, which preferably comprises two containers.These house the borate gelling agents solution and the drug polyvinyl alcohol solution, respectively.These units are delivered from the manufacturer in a sterile condition. It is useful to also provide a dispensing tip and a sterile closure therefor in the kit.A preferred kit of parts for producing a gel containing an acid stable drug will thus comprise a first container container B housing an aqueous solution containing the ophthalmic medicament and a polyvinyl alcohol, said first solution maintained at a pH to afford stability of the ophthalmic medicament, and a second container container A housing an aqueous solution containing a gelling agent. The first solution contains the ophthalmic medicament in an amount sufficient to make 0.05 10 by weight when the first solution is mixed with the second solution and the polyvinyl alcohol in an amount sufficient to make 1.3 by weight when the first solution is mixed with the second solution. The second solution contains the borate gelling agent in an amount sufficient to make 0.1 1 by weight when the first solution is mixed with the second solution.The second solution additionally contains buffers in an amount sufficient to afford a pH of 6.5 8.5 when the first solution is mixed with the second solution. If a boric acid and alkali combination is utilized to provide the borate gelling agent, the boric acid is placed in containerB and the alkali in container A . Preferably, the two solutions are packaged in a sterile condition.Prior to dispensing to the patient, the pharmacist, doctor or nurse, prepares the gel by merely adding the contents of container A to container B .A dispensing tip may then be placed on the container B and covered by a sterile closure prior to dispensing to the patient. The patient thus receives a container of the gel which is stable for at least 3 months and which is in an eye comfortable and convenient dosage form. Most advantageously, the dispensing pharmacist is provided with an eye compatible system which is in a sterile form when he receives it and thus requires no further sterilization prior to dispensing to the patient.The gel container will typically be of a suitable size so as to provide an amount of gel sufficient for a multitude of drug applications. The patient is thus provided with a prescription which does not have to be frequently refilled.The gel itself is well suited to patient self administration since its viscous nature provides a product which does not spill, drip or flow unwantedly from its dispenser. Additionally, and most advantageously, the gel form provides an improved therapeutic effect of enhanced duration. Thus, a patient using a pilocarpine gel will not experience the blurriness of vision towards the end of a treatment period such as is normally experienced by patients using pilocarpine eye drops. This blurriness occurs when the effects of the pilocarpine begin to wear off. Such a side effect is a severe handicap to glaucoma patients using pilocarpine eye drops on a regular and long term basis since it prevents or restricts normal activities such as reading, sewing and driving.Also advantageously, the enhanced therapeutic effect of the gel dosage form enables the dose of pilocarpine to be lowered,typically to about a 1 pilocarpine gel, while retaining the same degree of biological response.A gel containing 1.0 flunixin NNG likewise provides a suitable anti inflammatory response while a gel containing 0.2 gentamicin sulfate provides sufficient antibacterial effects.When preservatives, stabilizers or agents for adjusting the tonicity are used in the gel, and the gel is packaged in two separate containers, such preservatives or stabilizers may be present in either or both of the solutions. Preferably, however, they are contained in the solution containing the polyvinyl alcohol.The required daily dosage of the ophthalmic gel will depend on the patient s individual condition and the particular ophthalmic ailment disease state for which the gel is being employed. Typically, 0.05 to 0.8 ml of the gel will be administered 1 3 times per day.The following examples describe in detail compositions illustrative of the present invention and methods which have been devised for their preparation. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that many modificiations, both of materials and methods, may be practiced without departing from the purpose and intent of this disclosure.
