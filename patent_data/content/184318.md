# Plate, foam and screen filament quenching apparatus.

## Abstract
An apparatus for quenching synthetic filaments 21 which comprises an elongate chimney 10 , a porous open celled foam sheet 17 dividing said chimney longitudinally into a plenum chamber 13 and a quenching chamber 19 through which filaments 21 pass in a path from an extrusion device 20 to a means for collecting filaments 24 and a means to supply a flow of gas to the plenum chamber. The improvement comprises a mesh screen 18 coextensive with the foam sheet 17 positioned between the foam sheet 17 and the quenching chamber 19 .
