# Arrangement for generating a clock signal.

## Abstract
Arrangement for generating a clock signal from a bi phase modulated signal, comprising a controllable clock sig nal source. The polarity of the received signal 8 is sampled 9 at two sampling instants LFR4, LFR7 having a fixed re lationship. The polarity samples B, F are added modulo 2 16 and the resultant signal BF controls the controllable clock signal source VCO, 12 . A false synchronization detec tor comprises inter alia a modulo 2 adder 28 for comparing polarity samples in consecutive symbol intervals and a counter 27 for counting consecutively equal polarity sam ples.
