# Electric lamp and glass composition.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a glass composition which can be used as an intermediate glass for sealing tunsten current supply wires in borosilicate glass, for example, for use in discharge lamps. The intermediate glass has a coefficient of expansion of from 38 to 44.10 โท K ยน and does not contain any sodium oxide, potassium oxide and lead oxide. Favour able thermal properties are obtained if the composition of the intermediate glass is kept within narrow limits. The invention also relates to an electric lamp in which the intermediate glass is used.
