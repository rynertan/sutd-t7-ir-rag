## Description
STABILISED HERBICIDE COMPOSITION BASED ON META BISCARBAMATES This invention relates to a stabilised herbicide composition based on meta biscarbamates. It is known that herbicide compositions containing a compound of formula EMI1.1 wherein R1 can be alkyl, cycloalkyl or alkyl substituted by halogen and or alkyl and or trifluoromethyl3R2 can be hydrogen, alkyl or phenyl, or R1 and R2 jointly with the nitrogen atom can form a heterocyclic ring which may contain additional nitrogen or oxygen atoms R3 is an alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, which may be substituted by hydrogen, alkoxy or dialkylamino possess excellent herbicide action on sugar beet and other crops, if formulated with suitable adjuvants and interts. However, it is also known that the aforesaid compounds possess limited stability with time if prepared in common emulsifiable liquid herbicide compositions based on organic solvents, and which contain adjuvants and inerts having no stabilising effect. U.S. patent No. 3,898,075 describes the possibility of stabilising compounds of formula A in emulsifiable liquid herbicide compositions based on organic solvents, by adding a stabilising compound chosen from dicarboxylic aliphatic acids, hydrocarboxylic aliphatic acids, nitro substituted monocarboxylic aromatic acids, dicarboxylic aromatic acids, sulphonated aliphatic acids, and sulphonated aromatic acids. In addition to claiming these stabilisers, the aforesaid U.S.patent describes the already known addition of common adjuvants and inerts commonly used by the expert in this field for preparing emulsi friable liquid composition suitable for use as plant protection products. Specifically, stated suitable inerts are solvents based on aromatic hydrocarbons, cyclohexanone, isophorone, methylhexahydronaphthalene, dibutylphthalate, tetrahydronaphthalene, dimethylsulphoxide and dimethylformamide, and stated suitable surfactants are polyethoxylated amines, alcohols, acids and alkylphenols, and salts of alkylbenzene and naphthalenesulphonic acids. With the present invention, it has been unexpectedly found that compounds of formula EMI2.1 wherein R1 can be alkyl, cycloalkyl or alkyl subsituted by halogen and or alkyl and or trifluoromethyl R2 can be hydrogen, alkyl or phenyl, or R1 and R2 jointly with the nitrogen atom can form a heterocyclic ring which may contain further nitrogen or oxygen atomsR3 is an alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, possible substitued by halogen, alkoxy or dialkylamino can be formulated either as organic solvent based emulsifiable liquids or as fluid aqueous suspensions, and that such formulations may be stabilized with one or more of the following compounds I phosphoric and or suphuric acids, totally or partially esterified with aliphatic alcohols or with phenols or with alkyl phenols, even tually polyethoxylated or polypropoxylated or partially neutra lized.II monocarboxylic aromatic organic acids, which may be substituted3III inorganic acids and their salts, for use only in formulations in the form of fluid aqueous suspensions3 IV water soluble aliphatic or aromatic organic acids, which may be substituted, for exclusive use in fluid aqueous suspensions. With regard to the present invention, the most interesting compounds of formula A are 3 methoxycarbonyl ami nophenyl N 3 meythylphenyl carbamate Phenmedipham 3 ethoxycarbonyl aminophenyl N 3 methylphenyl carbamate Phen medipham ethyl 3 3 ethoxycarbonyl aminophenyl N phenylcarbamate Desmedipham 3 3 N,N dimethylureido NT mehtyl N phenylcarbamate 3 methoxyzarbonylamino phenyl N methyl N phenylcarbamates 3 methoxycarbonylaminophenyl N 3 methylbutyl 2 carbamate. Example of the aforesaid stabilisers for the compound of formula A as I II III IV which are usable either in organic solvent based emulsifiable liquid formulations or in fluid aqueous suspensions are as follows, divided into the groups defined heretofore I phosphoric esters or phosphates of polyethoxylated allylphenols of polyethoxy lated tristyryl and distyrylphenol phosphate type available commercially for example under the names SOPROPHOR or SOPRAL 3D 33 of Messrs. SOPROSOIE of Rochetaillee, France or under the nameSOITEM 8 FL of Messrs. SOITEM, Milan, Italy .phosphoric esters of non polyethoxylated synthetic alcohols for example SOPROPHOR MB of the aforesaid Messrs. SOPROSOIE sulphonic esters or sulphates of polyethoxylated arylphenols, partially neutralised with ammonia for example SOITEM FS of Messrs. SOITEM, or PREPARATION 1O D 163 of Messrs. SOPROSOIE phosphoric esters of polyethoxylated nonyl phenol as, for example, the market compounds with the trade marks GEK1NTOL PR H 4A and GERENOL PR H 4B of the firm Geronazzo, Milan, Italy 3 sulphuric esters of linear alcohols C8 C10 neutralized as isopropylamine salt as, for example, the compound sold with the trade markSOITEM AS 9 of the firm SOITEM, Milan, Italy .II benzoic acid, ortho chlorobenzoic acid, para aminobenzoic acid3III ortho meta and hypophosphoric acid3 sulphuric acid, nitric acid, hypochloric, perchloric and hydrochloric acid3 sulphates, nitrates and ammonium phosphates to be used as stabilizers only for fluid aqueous suspensions of meta biscarbamates5 IV formic, acetic, monochloroacetic, propionic, citric, tartaric, oxalic, malic, toluenesulphonic, benzosulphonic, methanesulphonic and ethanesulphonic acids also to be used only as stabilizers for fluid aqueous suspensions. With respect to the known art, the interest of the present invention is even greater when considering that various substances among those cited hereabove able to exhibit a stabilising effect also possess the property of acting as surfactants, ie as emulsifying or suspending agents, in herbicide formulations of either emulsifiable liquid or fluid aqueous suspension form, based on compounds of formula A , with obvious saving in adjuvants and greater composition economy. Moreover, all the stabilisers according to the invention exhibit their action in relatively small. doses, for the most part economical. In this respect, said stabilisers can be added to the composition according to the invention in a percentage varying from 0.005 to a theoretical maximum of 50 by weight, according to the type of formulation and the concentration of the compounds of formula A . In addition to the stabilisers with possible surfactant effect according to the invention, other surfactants, suspending agents or emulsifying agents can be added to formulations comprising compounds of formula A , as necessary for optimising the hydrophilic lipophi lic balance of the composition in accordance with the methods well known to the expert in this field for example calcium akylarylsulphonate, polyethoxylated fatty acids, polyethoxylated alkylarylphenols and others, described in the publication Mc Cutcheon s Detergent L Emulsifiers 1982 Annual International Edition, Glen Rock N.J. U.S.A. Other active antiparasite or adjuvant substances can also be added to the formulations according to the invention, in particular other herbicides, such as chloridazon, metamitron, ethofumesate, lenacil, cycloate, diallate, triallate, butachlor, metolachlor, trimexachlor and others. Of particular interest is the fact that the stabilisers according to the present invention can be used not only in organic solvent based emulsifiable liquid formulations, but also, contrary to the known art, in aqueous suspension formulations in the form of fluid pastes flowables , which can contain a higher concentration of active herbicide substances than is generally possible with emulsifiable liquid solutions of compounds of formula A . In the case of organic solvent based liquid formulations which are emulsifiable in water, the following composition can be used by way of example 5 50 preferably 10 35 of active substances of formula A 0.1 30 preferably 0.5 20 of stabiliser, which may also possess emulsifying action, possibly together with a further surfactant emulsifier not possessing stabilising action Remainder to 100 of solvent, together with other emulsifier if necessary. The solvents used can be isophoronc, cyclohexanone, aromatic hydrocarbons, dimethylsulphoxid, dimethylformamide, N methylpyrrolidonc and others. According to one particular aspect of the present invention, it is also possible to prepare herbicide compositons containing active substances of formula A as aqueous suspensions in fluid paste flowables . An improved type of paste formulation is prepared by micronisation in sand or pearl mills so as to attain an extremely fine active substance particle size, which is nearly totally less than 10 microns and having a high percentage of particles less than 2.5 microns. Such fluid aqueous suspension formulations can for example comprise the following usual components 16 60 preferably 40 55 of active substances of formula A 3 0.005 20 preferably 0.1 10 of stabiliser possibly with dispersing action3 and if necessary in mixture with other dispersants3 3 15 preferably 4 8 of an alcohol or glycol of antifreeze action eg. Methyl alcohol or ethylene glycol 3 0.05 0.6 preferably 0.1 0.4 of a hetero or homo polysaccharide thickening agent, possibly salified3 0.02 0.2 preferably 0.04 0.08 of an antifoaming compound such as a silicone compound . 0.01 0.2 preferably 0.02 0.1 of an antibacterial or antifungal compound such as a derivative of para oxybenzoic acid or formaldehyde 3 remainder to 100 water. Water base fluid pastes can also be prepared by emulsifying in water the active principle dissolved in a suitable solvent, with addition of suitable emulsifying and suspending agents as well as a stabilizer selected among those indicated by the present invention. The following can be listed as components of such type fluid pastes based on a water concentrated emulsion 5 35 preferably 8 17 of active substances of formula A 10 50 preferably 15 30 of suitable organic solvents 0.005 20 preferably 0.1 10 of stabilizer according to the invention, possibly also with emulsifying function 2 20 preferably 5 15 of suitable emulsifiers, which can be mixed with stabilizers possibly with function of emulsifiers o.o o.6 preferably 0.1 0.4 of a thickening agent of the type of hydrophile polymer3 0.01 0.2 preferably 0.02 0.1 of a bactericide and fungicide com pound remainder to 100 water. The composition according to the invention is particularly suitaable for use in the selective de weeding of, agricultural or horicultural crops such as sugar beet, fodder beet, beetroot, wheat, barley, corn, soya, groundnuts, citton, beans, peas, spinach, strawberries mainly in treatment after emergence, and in the case of certain compounds also in treatment before emergence or before sowing , by spraying dilute aqueous emulsions or suspensions containing from 0.15 to 3 kg ha of active substance.
