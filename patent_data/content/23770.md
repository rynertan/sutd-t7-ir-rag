As examples of the 5 or 6 membered ring of which Y is the residue, we would mention EMI7.1 EMI8.1 EMI9.1 When Y carries a fused benzene ring, this ring may be substituted with one or more of the substituents normally to be found in dyestuff molecules. Examples of such substituents include those listed hereinbefore as substituents which may be present in D. Preferably Y is orthophenylene in which the benzene ring carries a substituent R4. R4 is preferably lower alkyl, especially methyl. A preferred dyestuff has a cat ionic moiety of the formula EMI10.1 Al anions represented by A there may be mentioned, for example, anions of inorganic acids such as chloride, bromide, tetrachlorzincate, bisulphate, sulphate, tetrafluoroborats, slphamate, nitrate, phosphate and fluoride and anions of organic acide such as methosulphate, ethosulphate, methyl sulphonate, p tolyl suIphonate, acetate, oxalate, hydrogen otslate and forsake. In those cases where the anion is polyvalent the water soluble dyestuffs will contain a corresponding molar proportion of the eationic part of the dyestuff. In another aspect of the present invention there is provided a process for the manufacture of dyestuffs of the present invention which comprises quaternising a compound of the formula III EMI11.1 wherein D, R, R1 ,X and Y are as hereinbefore defined. When X is N R and R is the same as Rê, alkylation and quaternisation are conveniently carried out at the same time, the amount of quaternising agent used being adjusted accordingly. As examples of alkylating or quaternising agents there may be mentioned alkyl halides such as methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl chlorides and the corresponding bromides, alkenyl halides such as allyl chloride or bromide, aralkyl halides such as benzyl chloride or bromide, dialkyl sulphates such as dimethyl sulphate, diethyl sulphate, dipropyl sulphate and dibutyl sulphate, alkyl esters of aryl sulphonates such as methyl and ethyl p toluene sulphonate and other lower alkyl esters of strong mineral acids or organic sulphonates. Other agents may themselves carry substituents, for example chloropropionitrile, bromopropionamide and bromohydrin. reaction between the quaternising agent and the compound of the above formula may be carried out neat without addition of other solvents, or again may be carried out in an inert organic solvent such U benzene, toluene, xylene, chlorobenzene, nitrobenzene, acetone, carbontetrachloride, tetrachloroethane, perchloroethylene, chloroform, dimethyl formamide, acetonitrile, acetic acid, formic acid or 2 ethoxy ethanol. he quaternisation may also be effected in aqueous phase optionally in the presence of an organic solvent. The quaternising agent may be used in considerable excess, for aa ple up to 6 moles for sach mole of dyestuff.Suitable tamperatures are froc 200 to 1500C and particularly 20 90 C. The inclusion of an acid binding agent is often beneficial. Such agents include magnesium exide, sodium and potassium kydroxide, medium and potassion carbonate, sodium and potassium bienphonate, magnesium and c.acamm carbonate, potassium acetate or mixtures of such agents. Quaternisation may also be carried out by reacting with, for example, acrylamide in an organic or mineral acid such as acetic, foriic or hydrochloric acid or mixtures of these at between 50 and 100 C. Quaternisation lay also be carried out by reacting with ethylene oxide or its derivatives of formula EMI12.1 wherein and R6 represent hydrogen or an optionally substituted lower alkyl group. This reaction is carried out in a solvent in the presence of a mineral or organic acid which provides the anion A r at temperatures of 1O to 100 C and preferably 40 90 C. Suitable acids include sulphuric, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, phosphoric, benzenesulphonic, toluenesulphonic, formic, acetic of propionic.Such acids may also serve as solvent or may be used in admixture with each other or vith other organic solvent such as dimethylformamide, acetonitrile, dioxan, tetrahydrofuran, chlorobenzene, toluene, xylene, nitrobenzene, acetone or methylethylketone. When the reaction is effected in hydrophobic organic solvents the quaternised dyestuff is normally insoluble and may be isolated by filtration. if desired, the quaternised dyestuff may be isolated from aqueous solution by precipitation in the form of a salt such as tetrachlorozincate obtained by adding zinc chloride to the aqueous solution. As a result of the quaternisation the dyestuff may be obtained for example in the form of the chloride, bromide or methosulphate according to the alkylating agent used. If the dyestuff is required as the salt of a different anion, then one anion may be replaced by another by know methods, for example metathesis. Compounds for use as starting materials in the above quaterisation reaction may be obtained by diazotising an amineINH2 and reacting the diazoaium compound with a compound of the formula IT EMI14.1 wherein D, R, RÚ, X and Y are as hereinbefore defined.

Amines of the formula V EMI17.1 wherein R, R1, X and Y have the meanings hereinbefore defined, may also be used. According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a process for the manufacture of the dyestuffs of the invention which comprises diazotising an amine of the formula DNH2 and reacting the diazo compound with a compound of the formula VI EMI18.1 wherein D, B, RÚ. R2, X, Y and A are as hereinbefore defined. Thus in irking the dyestuffs of the invention a pyridone of formula IV may be coupled with a diazotised amine wH2 and the product quaternised or alternatively the pyridone may be quaternised and then coupled with a diazotised amine In yet a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a process for the manufacture of coupling components of the formula VII EMI18.2 wherein X is sulphur or NH and R and R have the meanings hereinbefore defined and the ring may be substituted, which comprises reacting a 3 cyano pyridone of the formula VIII EMI19.1 with an optionally substituted o phenylene diamine or o aminothiophenol as appropriate, in the presence of aluminium trichloride. When X is NH the invention also includes the coupling components so obtained. Coupling components of formula viz in which X is oxygen are also novel and may be made by the above process but the dyestuffs obtained therefrom are unstable.They and their process of manufacture do not, therefore, form part of the present invention. The benz ring B of the benziminazole moiety may be substituted with one or more substituents as hereinbefore described with respect to Y. The reaction can be simply carried out by mixing together the two reactants with anhydrous aluminium chloride and heating at an elevated temperature, usually from 150 to 2500C and preferably from 175 to 2200C e.g. 1900C, for an hour or more. On completion of reaction the reaction product, which preferably is first ground, is conveniently added to iced hydrochloric acid and the precipitated solid isolated by filtration, dried and, if desired, purified by, for instance, recrystallisation from a suitable solvent such as aqueous dimethyl formamide. The coupling component so obtained may be alkylated and quaternised and then reacted with the diazo component to form the dyestuffs of the invention alternatively the neutral dyestuff may be first formed which is then itself alkylated and quaternised. In either case theN substituents on a benziminazole moiety will be the same. The dyestuffs of the invention, which have excellent solubility, are valuable for the colouration of paper and for the colouration of synthetic polymeric materials by application from an aqueous bath. The dyestuffs give valuable bright shades, mainly yellow, of very high tinctorial strength. In particular the dyestuffs of the invention are valuable for colouring polyacrylonitrile materials ad may be applied thereto from acid, neutral or slightly alkaline dyebaths i.e. pH from 3 at temperatures between, for example, 4O C and 120 C, preferably between 80 C and 120 C or by printing techniques suing thickened printing putes. Greenish to reddish yellow dyeing. of excellent fastness properties to washing, perspiration, steam pleating and light are obtained. They also generally show good pH stability. The majority of the dyestuffs of the invention possess a further advantage in that they have compatibility values in the range 2.5 to 3.5, i.e. about 3 as assessed by the method for the determination oi compatibility values described in the Journal of the Society of Dyers and Colourists, Volume 87, No.2, p ge 60 1I . Compatibility is assessed on a scale oi 1 to 5 and dyers engaged in the dyeing of polycrylonitrile materials show a strong preference for dyestuffs haring a compatibility value or C.V. value U it is knows, of 2.5 to 3.5.Additionally, dyestuffs of C.V. 2.5 to 3.5 are compatible in dyeing properties with the large majority of mainstream commercial dyes used in the dyeing of polyacrylonitrile and the present dyestuffs are therefore advantageous for dyeing in admixture with known commeroial dyestuffs for polyacrylonitrile. The dyestuffs may also be used for the colouration of synthetic polymeric materials particularly polyacrylonitrile materials by wet transfer printing proceases in which a support such as paper, is printed with an ink containing the dyestuff, the printed support is placed in contact with a textile material and the shole then subjected to heat and pressure under humid wet conditions to transfer the dyestuff to the textile material. The invention is illustrated by the following example in which all parts and percentages are by weight except where otherwise indicated.Example 1 A Pyridone coupling component 17.8 Parts of 3 cyano 1 ethyl 2 hydroxy 4 methyl pyrid 6 one, 10.8 parts of o phenylenediamine and 15 parts of aluminium trichloride are mixed together and heated at 1 900C for 5 hours then cooled to room temperature and finally added to 30 parts of ice and 12 parts of concentrated hydrochloric acid.
