# Electrical connector.

## Abstract
An electrical connector 10 comprises a pair of mating dielectric connector bodies 16,30 each having a plurality of electrical contacts 18,34 which engage the electrical con tacts of the other when the connector bodies are coupled together. The coupled connector bodies are locked together by a projection 22 on one connector body 16 and a co operating lock arm 44 that is part of a resilient metal clip 42 which is attached to the other connector body 30 and which engages an electrical contact 26 on the one connec tor body when the coupled connector bodies are locked together. The resilient metal clip has a central slot 52 for the attachment of a conductor 60 to the clip and to permit disengagement of the lock arm by the use of a screwdriver or the like.
