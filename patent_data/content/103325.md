## Description
SCOURING CLEANSER COMPOSITIONSThe present invention relates to scouring cleanser composi tions and more particularly to improved scouring cleanser compositions in liquid form.For many years liquid scouring cleansers have been knows in the art and have been widely used in the household for the elimination of stubborn soils, greases, burnt materials and stains which are not easily removed by ordinary abrasivefree detergent compositions.Several problems are encountered in formulating liquid scouring cleansers. In pourable liquid detergent compositions containing solid particles of abrasive material, the latter tend to settle out on storage, which is inconvenient to the consumer, who has to re disperse them at the time of use. In the prior art this problem has been approached by providing a medium which exhibits Bingham plastic characteristics. Examples of such media have, inter alia, been described in UK Patents 1,167,597 1,181,607, 1,262,280 1,303,810 1,308,190 and 1,418,671. Other problems are related to the particular choice of the abrasive material. Such a choice often constitutes a compromise between cleaning efficacy and minimizing the risk of damage to delicate surfaces.In general hard abrasives and relatively large particles are satisfactory for the removal of difficult soils but may cause scratching, whereas softer abrasives and smaller particles cause less scratching and other abrasion of substrates from which soil has to be removed. It has long been recognized that a careful choice of the particle size range of the abrasive is of great importance for a good and effective cleanser. The abrasive powders hitherto used in commercial household scouring cleansers have particle sizes ranging from below 1 micron to about 150 or 200 microns, with an average part cle size of between 10 and 50 microns, irrespective of the material used as abrasive. In such abrasive powders there is a concentration of particles in the range from 10 to 50 microns diameter, with amounts of particles below and above this range decreasing as the difference from the average particle size increases.As abrasive powders incorporated in scouring cleansers are in practice made by grinding or crushing minerals, the powders obtained have a wide range of particle sizes. As coarse particles tend to cause scratching and very fine particles are ineffective as abrasives, the commercial producer of abrasive powders used in household scouring cleansers operates a size reduction process in sucb a wav as to produce an optimum average or mean particle size and as narrow a range of particle sizes centred around this optimum as can be achieved without using a costly classification step.Normally the abrasive powder will be included into the compositions as supplied, but it may be advantageous to decrease the amount of very fine particles in the abrasive in order to get better rinse away properties. It is believed that especially this very fine particle fraction tends to redeposit on glossy surfaces, thus forming a dull film, if rinsing has not been sufficiently repeated after using the abrasive. Reference is made in this respect to our UK Patent 1,581,433.The particle size of an abrasive iz expressed in detail s a distribution curve on a graph, in which the nominal diameter in microns is plotted against cumulative amounts of material in percent by weight. Such a graph is illustrated in the aforesaid UK Patent 1,581,433 diagram, in which the particle size distributions of four abrasive powders which have been used extensively in household scouring cleansers, namely silica A , feldspar B and calcite C and D , are given as curves. The mean particle sizes of the abrasives concerned are the sizes at which 50 by weight of the particles are larger and 50 are smaller, and are 22, 22, 27 and 15 microns respectively. The mean particle size is here to be understood to be the median particle size.It has now been found that if in the formulation of a liquid scouring cleanser, a low mean particle size abrasive is used, particularly with a very sharp particle size distribution a product is obtained which, without a substantial loss in cleaning efficiency does not produce visible scratching, has good rinse away properties and does not feel gritty, providing the consumer with a very soft and smooth touch during use.Consequently, in its broadest aspects, the present inven tion provides liquid scouring cleanser compositions comprising a suspending liquid medium, a natural or synthetic detergent surfactant and an abrasive powder with a mean particle size between 4 and 17.5 microns, containing substantially no particles with sizes above 75 microns.Preferably, the particle size distribution is such that less than 10 is below 4, especially below 5 or even 7 microns. Preferably also less than 10 is above 40, 30 or even 25 microns. It is preferable for the mean particle size to be between 6 and 15 microns or even between 10 and 15 microns. Preferably at least 80 of the abrasive has a particle size in the range from 5 to 30 microns or even 6 to 25 microns. The percentages refer to percentages by weight.Suitable for use as the abrasive material are both natural and synthetic abrasives, for example dolomite, precipitated calcium carbonate aragonite , feldspar, alumina, silica abrasives, such as quartz and quartzite preferably an abrasive material is used with a hardness on Moh s scale of from 1 to 4. Particularly suitable is calcite, for instance limestone, chalk or marble, such as those forms of calcite referred to in UK Patent 1,345,119. The abrasive material is generally present in an amount of from 1 to 65 percent, preferably from 2 to 60 percent by weight of the final composition.The liquid medium normally comprises an aqueous medium in which an anionic detergent material is present, preferably in combination with a nonionic or zwitterionic detergent .material. Suitable anionic surfactants are alkali metal or alkanol amine salts of C12 C18 branched or straight chain alkylaryl sulphonates, of Cl Cl8 paraffin sulphonates, ofC8 C12 branched or straight chain alkyl sulphates, of C10C18 alkyl EO 110 sulphates, of Clo C24 fatty acid soaps etc. In general the amount of anionic surfactant will vary between 0.5 and 15 percent, preferably between 2 and 10 percent by weight of the final composition.It is often desirable to include also a nonionic or zwitterionic detergent material in the aqueous medium in an amount of from 0.3 to 7 percent, preferably from 0.5 to 5 percent by weight. Suitable examples of nonionic detergents are water soluble condensation products of ethylene and or propylene oxide with linear primary or secondary C8 C18 alcohols, with C8 C18 fatty acid amides or fatty acid alkylolamides both mono and di amides , with Cg Cl8 alkyl phenols and so on. The alkoxylated C8 C18 fatty acid mono and dialkylolamides should contain more than one alkylene oxide unit fox example, they should be condensed with e.g. 2 5 moles of alkylene oxide such as ethylene oxide. Fatty acid mono or di alkylol amides in which the fatty acid radical contains 10 16 carbon atoms are also suitable nonionics, such as for instance coco fatty acid mono or di ethanol amide. Suitable zwitterionic detergents are trialkyl amine oxides having one long alkyl chain C8 C18 and two short C1 C4 alkyl chains betaines and sulphobetaines.It is highly desirable that the liquid medium should exhibit Bingham plastic characteristics, thus forming a stable suspending medium for the abrasive material. Such media using the above mentioned surfactants, possibly in combi nation with other surfactants, are described in British patent specifications 1 167 597, 1 181 607, 1 262 280, 1 303 810, 1 308 190 and 1 418 671. It is often desirable that a liquid abrasive cleanser also comprises an electrolyte or mixture of electrolytes,such as alkalimetalchlorides, nitrates, silicates, borates, carbonates, sulphates, orthophosphates, pyro and poly phosphates, citrates, nitrilotriacetates and mixtures thereof.The level of electrolyte will range from 0 to 25 percent, preferably from 5 to 20 percent by weight of the liquid medium without the abrasive materials.Other adjuncts for liquid abrasive cleansers may be included, such as colouring agents1 perfumes, fluorescers, hydrotropes, soil suspending agents, bleaching agents, bleach precursors, enzymes, opacifiers, germicides, humectants, etc.The invention will further be described by way of example.In the following tests the following liquid scouring composition was used by weight sodi umalkylbenzenesulphonate 3.2C9 C11 alcohol 6EO 0.9 coconutmonoethanolamide 0.9 sodiumtriphosphate 1.25 sodiumcarhonate 1.25 preservative 0.01 perfume 0.3 ammonia solution 0.16 abrasive X water to 100The abrasive materials used were four different calcite abrasive materials I, II, III and IV, having a median particle size of 5, 7, 13 and 27 u respectively. Their particle size distributions are represented in the accompanying drawing.These abrasive materials were used at a level of 508 by weight in the liquid compositions, with the exception of I, which was used at a level of 452 by weight. IV is a material according to the prior art, and is included in the tests as comparison standard.The following tests were carried out FEEL OF GRITTINESSNeat liquid scourer is placed on a 4 perspex square. The product is covered with an identical piece of perspex. Holding the two squares between thumb and finger, they are moved over each other and the grittiness of the product between them assessed on a scale. This is from 0 smooth to 4 considerably gritty. A series of products were tested in this way against a standard product, viz. current JIF as sold in the UK. TACTILE FEEL OF GRITTINESSThe fingers can readily feel gritty particles when a cream scourer is rubbed between the thumb and fingers. By asking a panel of people to feel product between their fingers and ranking them as smooth, slightly gritty to considerably gritty, on a O 4 scale, a Tactile Grittiness score can be obtained.IN USE FEEL OF GRITTINESSA thin layer of Carbon Black is smeared onto pieces of white formica 9 x 4 and panel members are requested to clean a section of the formica surface using product on a piece of moist Terry Towelling.Panellists are then asked to rank each product tested on a 0 4 nil considerable grittiness scale.SURFACE DAMAGETesting was carried out on the W.I.R.A. using 64 rubs, with no head weight and a terry towelling head cover.Assessments were made by specular reflection at an angle of 45 C using the Solartron.RINSING 20 mls of the product was squirted around a stainless steel sink and rinsed away with a constant flow of water at 250C.
