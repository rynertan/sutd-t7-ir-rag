# Amorphous antipilferage marker.

## Abstract
A magnetic theft detection system marker is adapted to generate magnetic fields at frequencies that 1 are harmon ically related to an incident magnetic field applied within an interrogation zone and 2 have selected tones that provide the marker with signal identity. The marker is an elongated, ductile strip of amorphous ferromagnetic material having a value of magnetostriction near zero that retains its signal identity under stress.
