# AM detectors demodulators.

## Abstract
An amplitude modulation detector usually comprises a rectifier diode or equivalent element feeding a capacitive load. To ensure linearity, the minimum carrier amplitude, i.e. in the troughs of the amplitude modulation, must exceed the non linear range of the diode. In turn, this may mean that the carrier amplitude at the waveform peaks are inconveniently high, particularly for high frequency carriers. The detector disclosed herein comprises an amplifier for receiving the carrier, a circuit for detecting and actively integrating the output of the amplifier and a negative feeedback network connected between the output of the detector integrator circuit and the amplifier input such that the amplifier output comprises a current signal indicative of the carrier feedback voltage difference. As a result, linear demodulation is achievable for quite low RF amplitudes.

## Description
TITLE AM DETE CTO5S DEMODULATORS When detecting a signal which is present as amplitude modulation of a relatively high frequency carrier wave, it is usually desirable that the detected demodulated output be a linear representation of the original modulating11 signal. The usual demodulator uses a diode, or an active equivalent, such as an emitter follower, together with a capacitive load. Provided the time constant of the load is large compared with the carrier period and small compared with the modulating signal, the output approximates to the modulating signal. However, there is a serious disadvantage to this basic circuit, well known N to those practised in the art, namely that the practical diode has a non ideal characteristic. In particular it needs a certain minimum voltage around 0.2 volts before conduction begins and it has a square law characteristic at low levels. This results in unfaithful reproduction of the modulation for low signal levels. To obtain linear demodulation it is evident that it is desirable to forward bias the diode slightly and to operate at as high a level of signal as possible. In practice, operation become linear to a few percent for signals exceeding 200 mV peak in the case of a modulated carrier the waveform troughs should therefore exceed this figure and if a working linear range of 30dB for example is needed then the peaks of the waveform would reach 6V. Such levels are often inconveniently high either because of supply voltage limitations or in the case of high frequency carriers e.g. 35 MEz , the difficulty of raising the hf signal to this level. Properly designed, the detectors described and illustrated herein may enable linear demodulation to be achieved at much lower levels 20 mV without the use of special detector diodes. Also these detectors may be implemented in a form suitable for incorporation in an integrated circuit. According to the invention, there is provided an amplitude modulation detector comprising amplifier means having an input for receiving an amplitude modulated RF signal and an input for receiving a feedback signal and being operable for forming a current signal corresponding to the difference between saidRF signal and said feedback signal, a detection and integration circuit for detecting and actively integrating said current signal, and feedback means for deriving said feedback signal from the output of said detection and integration circuit. For a better understanding of the invention, reference will be made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawing, in which figure 1 is a simplified diagram of an AM detector, and figure 2 is a circuit diagram of a practical realisation of the figure 1 detector. In figure 1, a modulated RF carrier V1 is connected to the inverse input of a differential amplifier of a type producing output current as a function of differential input voltage. The current output is fed via a diode D1 and an active integrator to the other input of the differential amplifier, the integrator comprising amplifier A2, feedback capacitor C1 and resistor R1. Thus, the feedback voltage V2 follows the modulation of the input carrier, because any discrepancy between the V1 peaks and V2 results in one way current into the integrator and hence an adjustment to V2. To a first order, the non linearity of D1 is unimportant. The integrator must be unable to follow the carrier frequency, but must follow the modulation frequency. V2 will follow V1 for low frequencies including zero frequency, behaving as a normal amplifier. Thus the same circuit will give the same results whether a low frequency input signal is presented or whether that signal is amplitude modulating a carrier, provided the two frequencies are in a suitable range for the integrator. This feature, if desired, can be removed by introducing a capacitor coupling at the input for V1 to Provide a low frequency cut off. Resistors R3 and R2 can be included as shown so that the output voltage V0 V1 R2 R3 R2, giving defined gain. The presence of these resistors also enables shaping to be provided, for example by the addition of diode D2 and resistor R4 shown in dashed lines, to modify the transfer characteristic. No tuned circuits are used in figure 1. In practice, C can be an intrinsic transistor capacitance so that no actual capacitors are used. This makes the configuration ideal for an integrated circuit design. In the practical implementation of figure 4, transistors T1 and T2 form a differential amplifier andT7 is a slow PNP device acting as an integrator, amplifier and detector. Diode connected transistorT4 is driven by resistor R8 and itself drives txansistors T3 and T5 in current mirror fashion, the actual division of currents being defined by resistors R5, R6 and R7.Transistors T3 and T5 provide high impendance loads forT1 T2 emitter circuit and T7 collector circuit respectively. Transistor T6 is a buffer to maintain the high voltage gain of T7 while driving feedback resistor R3. The figure 4 circuit may be suitable for incorporation into an integrated circuit, utilising as it does the inherent Vbe balance between T1 and T2 and between T3, T4 and T5, and usina a lateral PNP device T7 which effectively contains C, since its FT is low and its CCB high. The circuit operates over carrier frequencies of approxim√†tely 10 to 80 MHz, modulation from zero frequency to 200 KHz, input levels 30 mV to lV peak. Linearity correction by the combination of diode D2 and resistor R4 gives substantially linear demodulation over this input range.
