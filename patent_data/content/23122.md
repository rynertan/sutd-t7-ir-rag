# A tongue and buckle fastener for a safety belt harness.

## Abstract
A tongue and buckle fastener for a safety belt harness has a tongue 1 with a radiused head portion 3 shaped to mate with a recess 18 in an ejector 17 . A latch plate 20 moves at right angles to the direction of insertion of the tongue 1 to engage behind the head portion 3 of the tongue 1 . When the tongue 1 has been ejected, the latch plate 20 engages in a groove 28 in one side face of the ejector 17 and overhangs the recess 18 in the ejector 17 . When the tongue 1 is inserted, it engages corners 29a and 29b on the latch plate 20 which overhang the recess 18 so as to lift the latch plate 20 out of the groove 28 . If a member of any other shape than the tongue 1 is inserted, it cannot engage with both corners 29a and 29b simultaneously. Consequently only one side of the latch plate 20 is lifted and the ejector continues to block further insertion of such a member.
