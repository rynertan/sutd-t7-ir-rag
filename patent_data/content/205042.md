## Description
This invention relates to new polycyclic composi tions, methods for their preparation and uses thereof. In particular, it relates to bis cyclic carbonates and their phenolic precursors, and the use of said bis cyclic carbon ates as crosslinking and anti drip agents for polycarbonate resins. Polycarbonates are well known polymers which have good property profiles, particularly with respect to impact resistance, electrical properties, optical clarity, dimen sional rigidity and the like. These polymers are generally linear, but can be made with branched sites to enhance their properties in specific ways. Low levels of branching are generally incorporated into the resin by copolymerizing into the polymer backbone a polyfunctional reagent to yield a thermoplastic polycarbonate resin with enhanced rheological properties and melt strength which make it particularly suitable for such types of polymer processing procedures as the blow molding of large, hollow containers and the extru sion of complex profile forms. Special manufacturing runs must be set aside to prepare these branched polycarbonate resins. Sufficiently higher levels of branching sites in the resin will cause resin chains actually to join to each other to form partially or fully crosslinked resin networks which will no longer be thermoplastic in nature and which are expected to exhibit enhancements over corresponding linear resins in physical properties and or in their resis tance to abusive conditions, such as exposure to organic solvents. A wide variety of means have been employed to produce crosslinking in polycarbonate resins. These gener ally involve the incorporation of a suitably reactive chem ical group into the resin chain at its time of manufacture, as an additive to the resin after manufacture, or both. These reactive groups and the reactions they undergo are generally dissimilar from those characteristic of polycar bonate resins themselves and are therefore prone to have detrimental side effects on the physical and or chemical properties of the polymer. The conventional test used to judge the success of these means for crosslinking is to observe the formation of gels due to the crosslinked mater ial when a resin sample is mixed with a solvent, such as methylene chloride, in which normal linear polycarbonate resin is highly soluble. It is well known in the art that polycarbonates may be rendered flame retardant by the use of conventional flame retarding additives. While these conventional flame retardant polycarbonates are quite useful in many areas, there are some applications wherein an even greater degree of flame retardancy is required. This is particularly the case when dealing with rather thin polycarbonate articles, e.g., less than about 125 mils thick. These thin polycar bonate articles are very prone to the dripping of flaming particles, thereby making it very difficult for them to meet certain flame retardant standards such as, for example, those of Underwriters Laboratories UL 94. This problem of dripping flaming particles, or drip, has been addressed by the use, in addition to the conventional flame retardant agents, of various types of drip retardants or drip inhibit ors. However, many of these drip retardants are, to a cer tain degree, incompatible with polycarbonates and when used in quantities sufficient to render the polycarbonates drip retardant adversely affect their properties, such as optical clarity and surface appearance. There thus exists a need for drip retardants which are compatible with polycarbon ates. A principal object of the present invention, therefore, is to provide useful new compositions of matter, precursors therefor, and a method for their preparation. A further object is to provide compositions which react with polycarbonates under suitable conditions to produce crosslinked resins. A still further object is to provide compatible compositions which may be incorporated in polycarbonates, optionally in combination with flame retardant additives, to inhibit drip. A still further object is to provide new polycar bonate compositions with advantageous properties. Other objects will in part be obvious and will in part appear hereinafter. In one of its aspects, the present invention includes additives for polycarbonate resins which have structures and reactivities very similar to those of the polycarbonate itself. Thus, they offer the dual advantages of allowing branch sites to be incorporated into polycarbon ates during or subsequent to the manufacture thereof and of providing this branching or crosslinking by a method which produces residual structural groups in the final composition which are expected to be physically and chemically compat ible with the resin. The compositions contemplated as this aspect of the invention are polycyclic compounds having formula I in the drawings, wherein E is an alkylene radical containing from 2 to about 12 carbon atoms each of Q¹, Q², Q³ and Q⁴ is OH, or either or both of Q¹ and Q² together and Q³ and Q⁴ together form a carbon ate group i.e., a group of formula II each X is independently hydrogen or lower alkyl and each Z is independently lower alkyl. As will be apparent from formula I and the fore going description, the polycyclic compounds of this inven tion are bis cyclic carbonates and tetraphenols which may be considered their precursors. In formula I, the E value is an alkylene radical containing from 2 to about 12 carbon atoms. Included in the alkylene radicals are alkylidene radicals i.e., divalent aliphatic hydrocarbon radicals in which both free valence bonds are attached to the same carbon atom. Illustrative E values are ethylene, propylene, trimethylene, butylene, isobutylene, 2,3 dimethylbutylene, hexylene, dodecylene, isopropylidene and 3,3 decylidene. Normal alkylene radicals having 2 6 carbon atoms are pre ferred. The various Q values may be hydroxy groups or may be combined to form carbonate groups. Thus, the invention includes tetraphenols in which Q¹, Q², Q³ and Q⁴ are each hydroxy. It also includes bis cyclic carbonates in which Q¹ and Q² together and Q³ and Q⁴ together, from carbonate groups. Also contemplated are mono cyclic carbonates in which either of the Q¹ Q² and Q³ Q⁴ combinations, but not both, form a carbonate group. While such mono cyclic carbonates are not a preferred part of the invention, they may be encountered as intermediate or transition stages in the conversion of the tetraphenols into the bis cyclic carbonates . Each X value may independently be hydrogen or any lower alkyl radical i.e., alkyl radical containing up to 7 carbon atoms and each Z value may independently be any lower alkyl radical. The alkyl radicals may be normal or branched examples are methyl, ethyl, 1 propyl, 2 propyl, 1 butyl, 2 butyl, isobutyl, t butyl, 1 pentyl, neopentyl, hexyl, 2,3 dimethylbutyl and 1 heptyl. Preferred are the n alkyl radicals and especially those containing 1 3 carbon atoms. The methyl radical is most preferred. It is within the scope of the invention for all alkyl radicals to be different. Most often, however, all Z values are the same and all X values are the same. The tetraphenols of this invention may be prepared by the condensation of a dialdehyde of formula III with at least one phenol of formula IV. This method of preparation is another aspect of the invention. Illustrative dialde hydes are succinaldehyde, dimethylmalonaldehyde, glutaral dehyde, suberaldehyde and sebacaldehyde illustrative phenols are p cresol, 2,4 dimethylphenol and 2 ethyl 4 n butylphenol. If a mixture of phenols is used, the distri bution of the X and Z substituents on the tetraphenol will vary according to the molecular structures of the phenol reactants and their relative reactivities with the dialde hyde. Most often, however, a single phenol reactant is used and all four of the phenolic moieties in the tetraphenol have the same substituents. As will be apparent from formula I, the stoichio metry of the reaction requires at least four moles of phenol reactant for each mole of dialdehyde. Most often, an excess of phenol is used, typically a 50 100 excess. The reaction is ordinarily carried out in the presence of a mineral acid such as hydrochloric or sulfuric acid, using a catalytic amount of a mercaptan such as mercaptoacetic acid. Normal reaction temperatures are in the range of about 30 100 C, with 40 60 C being preferred. The preparation of the tetraphenols of this inven tion is illustrated by the following examples. A 2000 ml. four neck flask was fitted with a mech anical stirrer, a gas inlet tube, a dropping funnel and dry ing tube which had a nitrogen purge line passing past its outlet. The flask was placed in a 50 55 C water bath. To the flask was added 1000 grams 9.25 moles of melted p cresol. The flask was purged with nitrogen, then anhy drous hydrogen chloride was introduced until the p cresol was saturated with it and 2 ml. of mercaptoacetic acid was added. With good agitation and continuous slow addition of hydrogen chloride, 256 grams 1.28 mole of a 50 aqueous solution of glutaraldehyde was added dropwise over 3 hours. During the addition of the aldehyde, a precipitate began to form and by the end of the addition of the reaction mixture had become a thick paste. The water bath was then removed and the reaction mixture allowed to stand 3 days at room temperature. Volatiles were removed with a water aspirator vacuum and a water layer which had formed on the surface of the mixture was removed by decanting. Toluene was then added to the flask and the mixture stirred until it formed a uniform slurry. The mixture was transferred to a larger flask where it was mixed with additional toluene to a final total volume of 4000 ml. The precipitate was collected by vacuum filtration and washed with an additional 1400 ml. of toluene. The resulting hard paste was washed twice with 1500 ml. of water, with a Waring blender being used initi ally to produce a uniform aqueous slurry. The final pH of the water filtrate was 4 to 5. The sample was dried in a vacuum desiccator about 1 torr to yield 405 grams 65 of the desired 1,1,5,5 tetra 5 methyl 2 hydroxyphenyl pentane as a white powder m.p. 220 228 C . A 500 gram sample of 25 aqueous glutaraldehyde was extracted five times with 250 ml. portions of methylene chloride and the combined extracts dried over MgSO₄, fil tered and the solvent partially removed on a rotary evapora tor to yield 200 ml. of a methylene chloride solution of glutaraldehyde. By NMR analysis, the solution was found to contain approximately 48 grams 0.48 mole of glutaralde hyde. A 1000 ml. four neck flask was fitted with a mech anical stirrer, a gas inlet tube, a dropping funnel and a drying tube which had a nitrogen purge line passing past its outlet. The flask was placed in a 60 C water bath. To the flask was added 489 grams 4.0 moles of 2,4 dimethylphenol. The flask was purged with nitrogen and anhydrous HCl was added until saturation, followed by 1 ml. of mercaptoacetic acid. With good agitation and continuous slow addition of HCl, the glutaraldehyde solution was added dropwise over three hours. A precipitate began to form after about 130 ml. of the solution had been added. The reaction mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature for 16 hours, then it was slurried in 1200 ml. of toluene, vacuum filtered and the precipitate re slurried in 500 ml. of toluene, filtered and allowed to air dry. The resultant powder was washed four times with 500 ml. of distilled water, then two times with 250 ml. of toluene. The sample was dried in a vacuum desiccator about 1 torr to yield 242 grams 91 of the desired 1,1,5,5 tetra 3,5 dimethyl 2 hydroxyphenyl pentane as a white powder m.p. 236 242 C . The bis cyclic carbonates of this invention may be prepared by reacting the above identified tetraphenols with phosgene, said reaction being another aspect of the invention. It is typically carried out at temperatures within the range of about 30 100 C, preferably about 40 85 C. In one embodiment of the invention, the reaction is conducted in solution in a substantially inert organic diluent such as methylene chloride, chloroform, benzene, toluene or xylene. A basic reagent, typically a tertiary amine such as pyridine or triethylamine, is usually incor porated in the reaction mixture as a hydrogen chloride scavenger. The phosgene is typically employed in about 10 25 excess of the 2 1 stoichiometric molar ratio, and the tertiary amine in an approximately stoichiometric amount with respect to liberated hydrogen chloride. Another embodiment employs an interfacial system analogous to those used for preparation of polycarbonates from bisphenols and phosgene. In such systems, there are present an aqueous phase and an organic phase substantially immiscible therewith. The aqueous phase is maintained strongly basic by the preence of an alkaline reagent such as sodium hydroxide. A catalyst, usually a tertiary amine such as triethylamine, is also generally present. The tempera ture and proportion of phosgene employed are typically with in the ranges employed in the solution method and or known in the art. Interfacial systems of this type are well known in the art and no detailed description thereof is deemed necessary. U.S. Patents 4,384,108 and 4,471,105, for exam ple, contain general disclosures of such systems and are incorporated by reference herein principally for said dis closures. The preparation of the bis cyclic carbonates of this invention is illustrated by the following examples. A 2000 ml. four neck flask was fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a gas inlet tube, a dry ice condenser which had its outlet connected through a drying tube to a caustic scrubber and an inlet tube about an inch long con nected through polypropylene tubing to a liquid metering pump Lab Pump, Jr. , RHSY, Fluid Metering, Inc. to which was connected an additional funnel. A solution of 74.5 grams 0.15 mole of the tetraphenol of Example 1 and 55 ml. 0.68 mole of pyridine diluted to a total volume of 300 ml. with methylene chloride was placed in the addition funnel. 1.25 liters of methylene chloride was placed in the flask. With the flask in a 10 C water bath, 34 grams 0.34 mole of phosgene was added at 1 gram min. The bath was then warmed to 38 40 C and, with vigorous stirring, the tetraphenol solution was added dropwise over a period of 8 hours. The flask was then allowed to cool to room temperature and the reaction mixture allowed to stand 16 hours, during which time large crystals of pyridinium hydrochloride formed. The solution was decanted from the crystals, washed three times with 400 ml. of distilled water, dried over MgSO₄ and filtered. The solvent was removed on a rotary evaporator to yield a white paste which was placed under a 0.5 torr vacuum for 16 hours to yield a hard, brittle solid. The solid was broken up and stirred with 60 ml. of toluene to yield a uniform slurry which upon vacuum filtration yielded a white powder. The powder was washed a second time with 60 ml. of toluene, then twice with 60 ml. of methanol, and dried under vacuum to yield 36 grams 44 of the desired bis cyclic carbonate as a fine white powder m.p. 269 276 C . The apparatus was set up as in Example 3. A solu tion of 74.5 grams 0.15 mole of the tetraphenol of Example 1 and 55 ml. 0.68 mole of pyridine diluted to a total volume of 200 ml. with methylene chloride was placed in the addition funnel. 1.25 liter of toluene was placed in the flask. With the flask in a 10 C water bath, 5 grams of phosgene was added at 1 gram min. The water bath tempera ture was then raised to 85 C and over a period of 60 minutes with vigorous stirring the solution was added dropwise with simultaneous addition of phosgene at 0.5 gram min. 35 grams, 0.35 mole total phosgene . A white precipitate formed during the addition. After allowing the reaction mixture to cool to room temperature and to stand 16 hours, the precipitate, which was a mixture of product and pyridin ium hydrochloride, was collected by vacuum filtration and dried to a white powder under vacuum. Removal of solvent from the filtrate on a rotary evaporator yields a viscous oil and no additional precipitate. The powder was washed twice with 500 ml. of water, then once with 150 ml. of methanol, and dried under vacuum to yield 29 grams 35 of the desired bis cyclic carbonate as a fine, white powder m.p. 260 277 C . A 2000 ml. four neck flask is fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a pH probe, a gas inlet tube and a Claisen adaptor to which is attached a dry ice condenser and an aqueous caustic inlet tube. To the flask is added 900 ml. of methylene chloride, 560 ml. of distilled water, 3.4 ml. of triethylamine, and a 11 gram 0.02 mole portion of the tetraphenol of Example 2. Phosgene is introduced into the flask at 1 gram min. for 50 minutes, with simultaneous addition at 5 minute intervals of additional 11 gram por tions of the tetraphenol to a total of 50 grams 0.5 mole of phosgene and 110 grams 0.2 mole of tetraphenol. The pH is maintained at 9 11 with addition of 25 aqueous NaOH. The methylene chloride layer is separated, washed once with 350 ml. of 3 aqueous HCl and three times with 350 ml. of distilled water, dried over MgSO₄, filtered and the solvent removed on a rotary evaporator to yield a solid residue. The solid is washed twice with 200 ml. portions of acetone, then recrystallized from toluene to yield the desired bis cyclic carbonate as a white powder m.p. 231.5 235.5 C . As previously mentioned, the bis cyclic carbon ates of this invention are useful as crosslinking and anti drip agents for polycarbonates. Accordingly, another aspect of the invention is a composition comprising a major proportion of at least one polycarbonate compound having a plurality of structural units of formula V, wherein A¹ is a divalent aromatic radical, and a minor proportion of at least one bis cyclic carbonate as described hereinabove. In one embodiment of the invention, the polycar bonate compound is one of the aromatic polycarbonate resins known in the art. They are generally derived from dihy droxyaromatic compounds of which the following are examples 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane bisphenol A hydroquinone resorcinol 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl pentane 2,4 dihydroxydiphenylmethane bis 2 hydroxyphenyl methane bis 4 hydroxyphenyl methane bis 4 hydroxy 5 nitrophenyl methane 1,1 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl ethane 3,3 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl pentane 2,2 dihydroxybiphenyl 2,6 dihydroxynaphthalene bis 4 hydroxydiphenyl sulfone bis 3,5 diethyl 4 hydroxyphenyl sulfone 2,2 bis 3,5 dimethyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propane 2,4 dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone 5 chloro 2,4 dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone bis 4 hydroxybiphenylyl sulfone 4,4 dihydroxydiphenyl ether 4,4 dihydroxy 3,3 dichlorodiphenyl ether 4,4 dihydroxy 2,5 dihydroxydiphenyl ether. Other dihydroxyaromatic compounds which are suitable for use in the preparation of aromatic polycarbonate resins are disclosed in U.S. Patents 2,999,835, 3,038,365, 3,334,156 and 4,131,575. The A¹ values preferably have formula VI, wherein each of A² and A³ is a single ring divalent aromatic radical and Y is a bridging radical in which one or two atoms separ ate A² from A³. The free valence bonds in formula VI are usually in the meta or para positions of A² and A³ in rela tion to Y. Such A¹ values may be considered as being derived from bisphenols of the formula HO A² Y A³ OH. In formula VI, the A² and A³ values may be unsub stituted phenylene or substituted derivatives thereof, illustrative substituents one or more being alkyl, alkenyl e.g., crosslinkable graftable moieties such as vinyl and allyl , halo especially chloro and or bromo , nitro, alkoxy and the like. Unsubstituted phenylene radicals are prefer red. Both A² and A³ are preferably p phenylene, although both may be o or m phenylene or one o or m phenylene and the other p phenylene. The bridging radical, Y, is one in which one or two atoms, preferably one, separate A² from A³. It is most often a hydrocarbon radical and particularly a saturated radical such as methylene, cyclohexylmethylene, 2 2.2.1 bicycloheptylmethylene, ethylene, 2,2 propylene, 1,1 2,2 dimethylpropylene , 1,1 cyclohexylene, 1,1 cyclopentadecyl ene, 1,1 cyclododecylene or 2,2 adamantylene, especially a gem alkylene radical. Also included, however, are unsatur ated radicals and radicals which are entirely or partially composed of atoms other than carbon and hydrogen. Examples of such radicals are 2,2 dichloroethylidene, carbonyl, thio and sulfone. For reasons of availability and particular suitability for the purposes of this invention, the prefer red radical of formula II is the 2,2 bis 4 phenylene propane radical, which is derived from bisphenol A and in which Y is 2,2 propylene and A² and A³ are each p phenylene. These aromatic polycarbonate resins can be manu factured by known processes, such as by reacting a dihydric phenol with a carbonate precursor such as phosgene, in accordance with methods set forth in the aforementioned patents and U.S. Patents 4,018,750 and 4,123,426, or by transesterification process such as are disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,153,008, as well as other processes known to those skilled in the art. It is possible to employ two or more different dihydric phenols, a copolymer of a dihydric phenol with a glycol, a hydroxy or acid terminated polyester or a dibasic acid in the event a carbonate copolymer or interpolymer or polyester polycarbonate rather than a carbonate homopolymer is desired for use in the preparation of the resinous com positions of this invention. Branched polycarbonates, such as those described in U.S. Patent 4,001,184, are also use ful. The disclosures of all of the aforementioned patents are incorporated by reference herein. Blends of any of the above materials may also be employed. Crosslinking according to the present invention may be carried out by reacting the bis cyclic carbonate with the aromatic polycarbonate in the melt form in the presence of catalytic quantities of a transesterification catalyst. One of the benefits of using a cyclic carbonate is that there should be significantly less fragmentation of the polycarbonate chain. The cyclic carbonate opens up, thus allowing addition at either side of the carbonate group. This allows for formation of structures of the type represented by formula VII, wherein R¹, R², R³ and R⁴ repre sent polycarbonate moieties of various chain lengths which may be derived from polycarbonates of the formulas R¹OCOOR² and R³OCOOR⁴. The amount of bis cyclic carbonate used will depend on the extent of crosslinking desired. In general, about 0.001 10 mole percent is used, based on polycarbonate structural units. The reaction temperature should be sufficiently high to create a melt of the reactants, generally in the range of about 200 350 C. When a polycarbonate resin is employed, such temperatures are typically achieved in an extruder or a molding machine such as an injection or compression molder normally employed for extruding or molding such resins. The final physical form of the crosslinked poly carbonate is at least partially dependent upon the quantity of bis cyclic carbonate present. If desired, gel like forms such as highly crosslinked thermoset materials can be avoided by utilizing relatively small quantities of the bis cyclic carbonate . The gels occur when greater quan tities of the bis cyclic carbonate are present. Also of significance are the reaction temperature and time. Also useful as polycarbonate compounds in the compositions of this invention are the cyclic polycarbonate oligomers. These are cyclic compounds containing a plural ity of structural units of formula V. They include dimers, trimers and tetramers of the type disclosed in the following U.S. patents 3,155,683 3,274,214 3,386,954 3,422,119. They also include cyclic polycarbonate oligomer mixtures of the type disclosed in copending, commonly owned application Serial No. 704,122, filed February 22, 1985, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein. The cyclic oligomer mixtures consist essentially of oligomers having degrees of polymerization from 2 to about 30 and preferably to about 20, with a major proportion being up to about 12 and a still larger proportion up to about 15. Since they are mixtures, these compositions have relatively low melting points as compared to single com pounds such as the corresponding cyclic trimer. The cyclic oligomer mixtures are generally liquid at temperatures above 300 C and most often at temperatures above 225 C. The mixtures useful in this invention contain very low proportions of linear oligomers. In general, no more than about 10 by weight, and most often no more than about 5 , of such linear oligomers are present. The mixtures also contain low percentages frequently less than 30 and pre ferably no higher than about 20 of polymers linear or cyclic having a degree of polymerization greater than about 30. Such polymers are frequently identified hereinafter as high polymer . These properties, coupled with the rela tively low melting points and viscosities of the cyclic oligomer mixtures, contribute to their utility in the inven tion. These mixtures may be prepared by a condensation reaction involving bishaloformates having the formula A¹ OCOQ⁵ ₂, wherein A¹ is as defined hereinabove and Q⁵ is chlorine or bromine. The condensation reaction typically takes place interfacially when a solution of said bishalo formate in a substantially non polar organic liquid is con tacted with a tertiary amine from a specific class and an aqueous alkali metal hydroxide solution. In one method for preparing the cyclic oligomer mixture, at least one such bishaloformate is contacted with at least one olephilic aliphatic or heterocyclic tertiary amine and an aqueous alkali metal hydroxide solution having a concentration of about 0.1 10 M, said contact being effected under conditions resulting in high dilution of bis haloformate, or the equivalent thereof, in a substantially non polar organic liquid which forms a two phase system with water and subsequently, the resulting cyclic oligomer mix ture is separated from at least a portion of the high poly mer and insoluble material present. While the Q⁵ values may be chlorine or bromine, the bischloroformates, in which Q⁵ is chlorine, are most readily available and their use is therefore preferred. Frequent reference to bischloroformates will be made here inafter, but it should be understood that other bishaloform ates may be substituted therefor as appropriate. The tertiary amines useful in the preparation of the cyclic polycarbonate oligomers generally comprise those which are oleophilic i.e., which are soluble in and highly active in organic media, especially those used in the oligo mer preparation method of this invention , and more particu larly those which are useful for the formation of polycar bonates. Reference is made, for example, to the tertiary amines disclosed in the aforementioned U.S. Patent 4,217,438 and in U.S. Patent 4,368,315, the disclosure of which is also incorporated by reference herein. They include ali phatic amines such as triethylamine, tri n propylamine, diethyl n propylamine and tri n butylamine and highly nucleophilic heterocyclic amines such as 4 dimethylamino pyridine which, for the purposes of this invention, con tains only one active amine group . The preferred amines are those which dissolve preferentially in the organic phase of the reaction system that is, for which the organic aque ous partition coefficient is greater than 1. This is true because intimate contact between the amine and the bis chloroformate is essential for the formation of the cyclic oligomer mixture. For the most part, such amines contain at least about 6 and preferably about 6 14 carbon atoms. The most useful amines are trialkylamines contain ing no branching on the carbon atoms in the 1 and 2 posi tions. Especially preferred are tri n alkylamines in which the alkyl groups contain up to about 4 carbon atoms. Tri ethylamine is most preferred by reason of its particular availability, low cost, and effectiveness in the preparation of products containing low percentages of linear oligomers and high polymers. The aqueous alkali metal hydroxide solution is most often lithium, sodium or potassium hydroxide, with sodium hydroxide being preferred because of its availability and relatively low cost. The concentration of said solution is about 0.2 10 M and preferably no higher than about 3 M. The fourth essential component in the cyclic olig omer preparation method is a substantially non polar organic liquid which forms a two phase system with water. The iden tity of the liquid is not critical, provided it possesses the stated properties. Illustrative liquids are aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene and xylene substituted aroma tic hydrocarbons such as chlorobenzene, o dichlorobenzene and nitrobenzene chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons such as chloroform and methylene chloride and mixtures of the fore going with ethers such as tetrahydrofuran. To prepare the cyclic oligomer mixture according to the above described method, the reagents and components are maintained in contact under conditions wherein the bis chloroformate is present in high dilution, or equivalent conditions. Actual high dilution conditions, requiring a large proportion of organic liquid, may be employed but are usually not preferred for cost and convenience reasons. Instead, simulated high dilution conditions known to those skilled in the art may be employed. For example, in one embodiment of the method the bischloroformate or a mixture thereof with the amine is added gradually to a mixture of the other materials. It is within the scope of this embodi ment to incorporate the amine in the mixture to which the bischloroformate is added, or to add it gradually, either in admixture with the amine or separately. Continuous or incremental addition of the amine is frequently preferred, whereupon the cyclic oligomer mixture is obtained in rela tively pure form and in high yield. Although addition of the bischloroformate neat i.e., without solvents is within the scope of this embodi ment, it is frequently inconvenient because many bischloro formates are solids. Therefore, it is preferably added as a solution in a portion of the organic liquid. The proportion of organic liquid used for this purpose is not critical about 25 75 by weight, and especially about 40 60 , is preferred. The reaction temperature is generally in the range of about 0 50 C. It is most often about 0 40 C and prefer ably 20 40 C. For maximization of the yield and purity of cyclic oligomers as opposed to high polymer and insoluble and or interactable by products, it is preferred to use not more than about 0.7 mole of bischloroformate per liter of organic liquid present in the reaction system, including any liquid used to dissolve said bischloroformate. Preferably, about 0.003 0.6 mole of bischloroformate is used. It should be noted that this is not a molar concentration in the organic liquid when the bischloroformate is added gradually, since it is consumed as it is added to the reaction system. The molar proportions of the reagents constitute another important feature for yield and purity maximization. The preferred molar ratio of amine to bischloroformate is about 0.1 1.0 1 and most often about 0.2 0.6 1. The prefer red molar ratio of alkali metal hydroxide to bischlorofor mate is about 1.5 3 1 and most often about 2 3 1. Step II of the cyclic oligomer preparation method is the separation of the oligomer mixture from at least a portion of the high polymer and insoluble material present. When other reagents are added to the alkali metal hydroxide and the preferred conditions and material proportions are otherwise employed, the cyclic oligomer mixture obtained as a solution in the organic liquid typically contains less than 30 by weight and frequently less than about 20 of high polymer and insoluble material. When all of the pre ferred conditions are employed, the product may contain 10 or even less of such material. Depending on the intended use of the cyclic oligomer mixture, the separation step may then be unnecessary. Therefore, a highly preferred method for preparing the cyclic oligomer mixture comprises the single step of conducting the reaction using as the amine at least one ali phatic or heterocyclic tertiary amine which, under the reac tion conditions, dissolves preferentially in the organic phase of the reaction system, and gradually adding bischlor oformate, amine and alkali metal hydroxide simultaneously to a substantially non polar organic liquid or a mixture of said liquid with water, said liquid or mixture being main tained at a temperature in the range of about 0 50 C the amount of bischloroformate used being up to about 0.7 mole for each liter of said organic liquid present in the reac tion system, and the molar proportions of amine and alkali metal hydroxide to bischloroformate being 0.2 1.0 1 and 2 3 1, respectively and recovering the cyclic oligomers thus formed. As in the embodiment previously described, another portion of said liquid may serve as a solvent for the bis chloroformate. Addition of each reagent is preferably con tinuous, but may be incremental for any or all of said reagents. When a separation step is necessary, the unwanted impurities may be removed in the necessary amounts by con ventional operations such as combining the solution with a non solvent for said impurities. Illustrative non solvents include ketones such as acetone and methyl isobutyl ketone and esters such as methyl acetate and ethyl acetate. Ace tone is a particularly preferred non solvent. Recovery of the cyclic oligomers normally means merely separating the same from diluent by known methods such as vacuum evapora tion and, optionally, from high polymer and other impuri ties. The preparation of cyclic oligomer mixtures useful in this invention is illustrated by the following examples. All parts and percentages in the examples herein are by weight unless otherwise indicated. Temperatures are in degrees Celsius. Molecular weights, whenever referred to herein, are weight average unless otherwise indicated and were determined by gel permeation chromatography relative to polystyrene. Bisphenol A bischloroformate was reacted with aqueous sodium hydroxide and triethylamine in an organic liquid chloroform in Example 12, methylene chloride in all other examples according to the following procedure The bischloroformate was dissolved in half the amount of organic liquid employed and was added gradually, with slow stirring, to the balance of the reaction mixture. In Examples 6 15 and 17, the triethylamine was all originally present in the reaction vessel in Examples 19 21, it was added gradually at the same time as the bischloroformates and in Examples 16, 18, 22 and 23, it was added incrementally at the begin ning of bischloroformate addition and at intervals of 20 during said addition. The amount of sodium hydroxide used was 2.4 moles per mole of bischloroformate. After all the bischloroformate had been added, the mixture was stirred for about 2 minutes and the reaction was quenched by the addi tion of a slight excess of 1 The reaction conditions for Examples 6 23 are listed in Table I together with the approximately percentage by weight of cyclic polycarbonate oligomer present in the product before high polymer precipitation. The weight average molecular weights of the cyclic oligomer mixtures were approximately 1300, corresponding to an average degree of polymerization of about 5.1. Bisphenol A bischloroformate 2.0 mmol. was reacted with aqueous sodium hydroxide and 4 dimethylamino pyridine in methylene chloride. The procedure employed was that of Example 6, except that 66.67 mmol. of bisphenol A per liter of methylene chloride was employed, the aqueous sodium hydroxide concentration was 5.0 The transesterification catalysts used in the reaction of the polycarbonate resin or oligomer with the bis cyclic carbonate may be any basic catalysts usually employed in such reactions. These include oxides, hydrides, hydroxides or amides of the alkali or alkaline earth metals as well as basic metal oxides such as zinc oxides, salts of weak acids such as lithium stearate and organotitanium, organoaluminum and organotin compounds such as tetraoctyl titanate, as well as the tetraphenylborate salts disclosed in copending, commonly owned application Serial No. 723,672, filed April 16, 1985, the disclosure of which is incorpor ated by reference herein. Because of potential steric hin drance, it is preferred to use catalysts with less bulky groups, e.g. lithium stearate as opposed to tetraoctyl titanate. The preparation of the polycarbonate compositions of this invention is illustrated by the following examples. Molar proportions are based on polycarbonate structural units. 2.5 grams 0.01 mole of bisphenol A polycarbonate powder intrinsic viscosity of 0.49 0.52 in methylene chlor ide at 25 C was combined with 10 ⁵ mole of tetraoctyl titanate TOT or lithium stearate LiST catalyst 0.1 mole percent and 2 or 5 mole percent of bis cyclic carbonate at 300 C under N₂ for a period of twenty minutes with thorough stirring of the melt. The quantity of gel was determined by swelling the resin thus produced with methylene chloride, filtering and washing with additional methylene chloride. The results are shown in Table II. In addition to these samples, five separate con trols were run at the same time and temperature bisphenol A polycarbonate alone and in combination with tetraoctyl titanate, lithium stearate, the Example 3 bis cyclic carbon ate and the Example 5 bis cyclic carbonate . No gels were formed with any of the control formulations. A solid mixture of 25 parts of a cyclic bisphenol A polycarbonate oligomer mixture similar to that of Example 6, 3 parts of the bis cyclic carbonate of Example 3 and 0.1 mole percent of the bisisopropoxyaluminum salt of ethyl acetoacetate was heated for 4 hours at 250 C, under nitro gen. The crosslinked polymer thus obtained was weighed and the unreacted polycarbonate was removed therefrom by extrac tion with methylene chloride for 48 hours in a Soxhlet extractor. The crosslinked residue was dried under vacuum at 75 C for 12 hours and weighed. It was found to comprise 46.5 of the total polycarbonate obtained. The procedure of Example 26 was repeated, except that the polymerization catalyst was tetramethylammonium tetraphenylborate. The crosslinked product comprised 99.7 of the total polymer. The bis cyclic carbonates of this invention are also useful as anti drip agents for polycarbonate resins, especially when used in combination with known flame retard ant agents. Accordingly, another aspect of the invention is a polycarbonate resin composition which, in addition to the bis cyclic carbonate , also contains an effective amount of at least one such flame retardant agent. The flame retard ant agents are conventional that positively upgrade the flame retardancy of polycarbonates. Some particularly useful flame retardants are the alkali and alkaline earth metal salts or organic sulfonic acids. These types of flame retardants are disclosed, for example, in the following U.S. Patents, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference 3,775,367 3,836,490 3,909,490 3,917,559 3,919,167 3,926,908 3,931,100 3,933,734 3,940,366 3,948,851 3,951,810 3,953,396 3,953,399 3,978,024. They include sodium 2,4,5 trichlorobenzenesulfonate, sodium benzenesulfonate, disodium naphthalene 2,6 disulfonate, sodium p iodobenzenesulfonate, sodium 4,4 dibromobiphenyl 3 sulfonate, sodium 2,3,4,5,6 pentachloro β styrenesulfon ate, sodium 4,4 dichlorodiphenyl sulfide 3 sulfonate, disodium tetrachlorodiphenyl ether disulfonate, disodium 4,4 dichlorobenzophenone 3,3 disulfonate, sodium 2,5 di chlorothiophene 3 sulfonate, sodium diphenylsulfone 3 sul fonate, sodium dimethyl 2,4,6 trichloro 5 sulfoisophthalate, potassium 2,4,5 trichlorobenzenesulfonate, calcium 2,4,5 trichlorobenzenesulfonanilide 4 sulfonate, sodium 4 1,4, 5,6,7,7 hexachlorobicyclo 2.2.1 hept 5 en endo 2 yl ben zenesulfonate and sodium perfluoroalkylsulfonate wherein alkyl is butyl or octyl. Conventional flame retardants other than the aforementioned sulfonates may also be employed. These conventional flame retardant additives generally contain a halogen, preferably chlorine and or bromine. That is to say, they are a halogen source. They may be inorganic or organic. Typical of the inorganic halogen sources are NaCl, KBr, etc. The organic halogen sources are preferably aro matic although certain aliphatic compounds are also useful. They include disodium hexafluoroglutarate, disodium chlor anilate, the halodiphenyl ethers such as tetrabromodiphenyl ether, polycarbonates derived from tetrabromobisphenol A and carbonate copolymers derived from tetrabromobisphenol A and bisphenol A. These flame retardant additives are present in the instant compositions in a flame retardant amount. By flame retardant amount is meant an amount effective to render said compositions flame retardant. Generally this amount is about 0.01 10 weight percent of flame retardant or of halo gen in a halogenated flame retardant, based on the total weight of the composition. About 0.1 5 weight percent is preferred. The bis cyclic carbonates are present in an anti drip amount which is usually about 0.01 5.0 by weight. The compositions of this invention may also con tain other commonly known and used additives. These include ultraviolet radiation absorbers such as the benzophenones, benzotriazoles, cyanoacrylates, and the like hydrolytic stabilizers such as the epoxides disclosed in U.S. Patents 3,489,716, 4,138,379 and 3,839,247 and color stabilizers such as the organophosphites disclosed in U.S. Patents 3,305,520 and 4,118,370. The disclosures of all of the foregoing are incorporated by reference herein. The preparation of the flame retardant resin compositions of the present invention is illustrated by the following examples. The blends listed in Table III were prepared by extrusion at 265 C followed by comminution of the extrudate into pellets. The blends were injection molded at about 315 C into test bars which were subjected to the test procedure described in Underwriters Laboratories Bulletin 94. In accordance with this test procedure, the materials were rated V 0, V I or V II based on the burning properties of five specimens. The criteria for each rating was as fol lows. V 0 Average flaming and or glowing after removal of the igniting flame shall not exceed 5 seconds, and none of the specimens shall drip particles which ignite absorbent cotton. V I Average flaming and or glowing after removal of the igniting flame shall not exceed 25 seconds and none of the specimens shall drip particles which ignite absorbent cotton. V II Average flame and or glowing after removal of the igniting flame shall not exceed 25 seconds and the specimens drip flaming particles which ignite absorbent cotton. UL 94 requires that all test parts must meet the V type rating to achieve the particular rating. Otherwise, the 5 bars receive the rating of the worst single bar. For example, if one bar is classified as UL 94 V II and the other four 4 are classified as UL 94 V 0, then the rating for all 5 bars is UL 94 V II. In addition, a test bar which continued to burn for more than 25 seconds after removal of the igniting flame was classified, not by UL 94 but by the standards of the instant invention, as burning . The results are shown in Table IV. As illustrated by these data, the examples con taining a flame retardant additive but no bis cyclic carbon ate inhibit a certain degree of flame retardance but never theless also exhibit dripping. On the other hand, when the bis cyclic carbonate of this invention is used in conjunc tion with the flame retardant additives, they exhibit drip retardant characteristics. To 100 parts by weight of the polycarbonate of Examples 28 29 was added 0.6 parts of sodium 2,4,5 tri chlorobenzenesulfonate. The mixture was extruded, molded into test bars and tested in the same manner as Examples 28 29. Each of the five test bars had at least one flaming drip and had an average flame out time of 3.9 seconds and a range of flame out times of 1.2 to 11.6 seconds. To the composition of Example 30 prior to extru sion was added 1.1 of the bis cyclic carbonate of Example 3. Only three of the five test bars had at least one flam ing drip. The average flame out time was 1.9 seconds with a range of flame out times from 0.1 to 4.3 seconds.
