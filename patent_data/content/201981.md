# A method and an apparatus for spraying a liquid.

## Abstract
A method and an apparatus for the spraying onto a field of a liquid such as a herbicide solution by means of a spraying apparatus, propellable over the field, with a series of spraying members 3 fed by a common liquid pressure pump 6 wherein a carrier fluid is supplied to the spraying members 3 by means of the pump and the active substance in the stream of carrier fluid is added by means of a second regulatable pump 12 , wherein the volume of carrier fluid provided to the spraying means 3 is controlled dependantly on the quantity of active substance by a regulating system 5 controlling one of the two fluid flows, in order to keep the concentration of active substance in the carrier fluid constant irrespective of the travel velocity, ensuring that although the quantity of the active substance is regulated dependantly on the travel velocity, the concentration is independant thereof, resulting in a homogeneous spreading of the active subst ance over the full width of the strip of land to be sprayed.
