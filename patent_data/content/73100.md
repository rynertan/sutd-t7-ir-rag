The compounds of this invention may be provided in orally administrable form, for example as tablets or capsules. The compounds of this invention may be provided in a form suitable for administration by injection or infusion, for example in the form of a sterile salt such as the sterile sodium salt sealed in a vial ampoule. It is believed that infections most readily treated by the compounds of this invention are those due to strains of Bacillus, Staphylococcus and Streptococcus. The present invention also provides a process for the preparation of a compound of the formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable or cleavable ester thereof which process comprises the reduction of a compound of the formula VII EMI15.1 wherein Ra is a hydrogen atom or carboxy blocking group,E is as defined in relation to formula I and G is a group RCONH wherein R is as defined in relation to formula I or G is an azido, amino or protected amino group and thereafter i if G is azido or protected amino converting G to amino, ii acylating any compound wherein G is amino with an N acylating derivative of a carboxylic acid of the formula VIII RCO2H VIII wherein R is as hereinabove defined and any group capable of being acylated is optionally protected iii converting an ester to form an acid or pharmaceutically acceptable salt, iv converting an acid or salt to form a cleavable ester. Preferably G is a group RCONH. The reduction of the compound of the formula VII may be suitably effected by hydrogenation, preferably in the presence of a transition metal catalyst. The pressure of hydrogen used in the reaction may be low, medium or high but in general an approximately atmospheric or slightly super atmospheric pressure of hydrogen is preferred. The transition metal catalyst employed is preferably palladium on charcoal or on calcium carbonate. The hydrogenation may be effected in any inert solvent in which the ester is soluble such as aqueous dioxan or the like. If this hydrogenation is performed on a compound of the formula VII whereinRa is a salt forming cation or hydrogenolysable group and is carried out in the presence of a base then a salt of the compound of the formula I is produced. Suitable bases for inclusion include Narc03, KHC03, Na2C03,K2C03, CaC03, MgC03, LiHC03, NH4OCOCH3 and the like. If no base is present then hydrogenation leads to the preparation of an acid within formula I which may then be neutralised if desired to yield a salt. Suitable bases which may be used to neutralise acids within formula I include Lion, NaOH, NaHC03, KOH, Ca OH 2 and Ba OH 2. An alternative method of hydrogenation suitable for use in this procedure is catalytic transfer hydrogenation using a transition metal catalyst. The transition metal catalyst employed is preferably palladium, for example palladium on carbon, palladium on barium sulphate or palladium black. It is preferred to use palladium on carbon, for example 10 palladium on charcoal. Suitable solvents include those in which the compound is soluble, for example ethanol, dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide and mixtures thereof. In catalytic transfer hydrogenation a hydrogen donor is used not hydrogen gas . Suitable hydrogen donors include cyclohexene and 1, 4 cyclohexadiene.The reaction is conveniently performed at an elevated temperature suitably between ambient and 100 C, more suitably between 300C and 800C. It is sometimes suitable to perform the reaction at reflux temperature. The term acylating derivative of a carboxylic acid includes any N acylating compound suitable for the performance of analogous reactions with 6 aminopenicillanic acid or 7 aminocephalosporanic acid or salts or esters thereof, for example an acid halide, a mixed anhydride or other reactive derivative such as that produced by the reaction of an acid with an enzyme or a condensation promoting agent such as dicyclohexylcarbodi imide or its chemical equivalent. Reactive groups present in such acylating agents may be protected in conventional manner. Suitable N acylating compounds may be summarised by the formula IX RCO W IX wherein R is as defined in relation to a compound of the formula I and W is a readily displaceable group. Most suitably W is a bromine atom. Preferably W is a chlorine atom. Reduction of the azido group to an amino group may be performed in conventional manner. Suitably G is a protected amino group, which is protected in conventional manner known in the art. Any group R that contains a reactive moiety such as NH2 or CO2H may be suitably protected during the process of this invention. For example an amino group may be reacted with a p nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl halide to provide a p nitrobenzyloxycarbonylamino moiety which is cleavable on hydrogenation to yield an amino moiety. Suitable carboxyl blocking derivatives for the group CO2R in formulae VII include salts, esters, and anhydride derivatives of the carboxylic acid. The derivative is one which may readily be cleaved at a later stage of the reaction. The salts need not be pharmaceutically acceptable. Suitable salts include inorganic salts, for example metal salts such as silver or mercuric salt, or alkali metal salts such as the lithium or sodium salt, and tertiary amine salts. Suitable ester forming carboxyl blocking groups are those which may be removed under conventional conditions, and include those of sub formulae L M as hereinbefore defined. Such groups for Ra include benzyl, p methoxybenzyl, 2,4, 6 trimethylbenzyl, 3, 5 di t butyl 4 hydroxybenzyl, benzoylmethyl, p nitrobenzyl, 4 pyridylmethyl, 2,2, 2 trichloroethyl, 2,2,2 tribromoethyl, acetonyl, 2 methylallyl, t butyl, t amyl, diphenylmethyl, triphenylmethyl, methyl, ethyl, allyl, adamantyl, o nitrobenzyl, 2 benzyloxphenyl, 4 methylthiophenyl, tetrahydrofur 2 yl, tetrahydropyran 2 yl, methoxymethyl, a silyl, stannyl or phosphorus containing group, or an in vivo hydrolysable ester. The carboxyl group may be regenerated from any of the above esters by usual methods appropriate to the particular Ra group, for example, acid and base catalysed hydrolysis, or by enzymically catalysed hydrolysis, photolysis or by hydrogenation. The hydrolysis must of course by carried out under conditions to which the groups on the rest of the molecule are stable. The salts of acids of formula I may be converted to esters in conventional manner. Suitable methods include the reaction of an alkali metal salt such as a sodium or potassium salt with a reactive halide or sulphcnate ester such as a bromide, chloride, mesylate or tosylate, for example bromophthalide. Such esterification may be carried out under conventional conditions, for example in dimethylformamide at room temperature.
