# Film accumulating device for developing apparatus.

## Abstract
A film accumulating device 42 is connected to a developing apparatus in which a film 38 is developed while being guided by a leader 46 attached to the leading end of the film 38 . The leader 46 is guided obliquely upward until it abuts against guide means 228 . Then, the leader 46 moves upwardly while being guided by the guide means 228 . Thereafter, one of the surfaces of the leader 46 abuts against a hook 232 , and the leading end thereof abuts against a stopper 230 , whereby the upward movement is stopped. When the force for feeding out the leader 46 has disappeared, the leader 46 slightly lowers such as to be suspended from the hook 232 . Thus, the film 38 following the leader 46 is deposited in a state wherein it is suspended from the leader 46 .
