# CRIMP ANGLE MODIFICATION PROCESS AND APPARATUS

## Abstract
Process and apparatus for modifying the crimp angle memory of a crimped yarn are provided. The process com prises extending the crimp angle of the yarn by applying tension to the yarn, and heating the yarn while under that tension to at least the glass transition temperature, but below the melting point, of the yarn material. The apparatus comprises a pair of nip rolls, from which the yarn passes through a heated chamber to a cutter.
