# Burner system for gaseous and or liquid fuels with a minimum production of NOx.

## Abstract
A low NOx burner 10 for a furnace operating under natural draught in which primary and secondary combustion air 60, 62 are provided to a first burning zone 16, 18 in which either or both liquid and gaseous fuel can be used. Less than stoichiometric air is supplied in the primary burning zone 6, 18 and tertiary combustion air 50 is supplied in a second combustion zone 28 downstream from the first combustion zone 16, 18 . The total air supply is over the stoichiometric requirement. Air control means 38, 40, 42 and 44 is provided so that a fixed ratio of primary secondary air tertiary air is provided for all burning and fuel rate conditions, so as to maintain the less than stoichiometric air supply to the first combustion zone. In addition, water atomization 68,70, 88 and 89 is provided upstream of the first burning zone 16, 18 to provide a burning chemistry which factors the reduction of NOx in the first burning zone.
