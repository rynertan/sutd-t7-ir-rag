## Abstract
An elastic raising member 32 is disposed in a raising member housing 26 provided at the distal end of an insertion section 16 and has one end of which is supported by the housing 26 and the other end of which is a free end 41 . When the free end 41 is pulled by a control wire 38 extending along the insertion section 16 by operating a control unit 46 , the raising member 32 changes the guiding direction of a treatment tool 31 . When the free end 41 is released, the raising member 32 is restored to a lying position by its elasticity.
