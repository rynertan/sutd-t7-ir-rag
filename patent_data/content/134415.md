# Magnetic tape reel package.

## Abstract
A packaging system for 26,67cm 10 1 2 inch magnetic tape reels in which ten such reels are axially stacked and separated by stacking rings. This axially stacked assembly is then stretch wrapped in a manner which produces substan tial overlap of the stretch wrap material. A support panel assembly 41 , and two mounting plugs 40 , capture the reels and the wrap material, to thereby seal the reels, and also support the reels with the edges thereof protected. An overpack box conforms to the shape of the support panel assembly, to further support and protect the reels, with the reel edges out of contact with the inner surface of the overpack box.
