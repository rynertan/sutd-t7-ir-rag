# Method and apparatus for selectively presenting, particularly in motor vehicles the same informative message in different languages.

## Abstract
A message is selectively presented in several different languages on an alpha numeric visual display device 1 . The display device 1 has surface segments 10 to 24, 30 to 44, 50 to 54 each of which can be selectively and individually switched, by connection to a power supply 92 , between two operational states one of which corresponds to visual perceptibility of the segment itself. Selective interconnection of the segments and power supply is effected via connecting lines 71 to 85 , the number of such lines being the same as the number of sub sets of the complete set constituted by the languages in which the message is to be presented, whereby each of the lines 71 to 85 corresponds uniquely to one of the sub sets. Each of these lines 71 to 85 is connected to all the segments that are only required to be switched to their states of perceptibility during the presentation of the mes sage in each and every language contained in the corres ponding sub set. Selector means 91 enable a language of message presentation to be selected, and serve to intercon nect the power supply 92 with all those, and only those, connecting lines 71 to 85 which correspond to the sub sets containing the selected language.
