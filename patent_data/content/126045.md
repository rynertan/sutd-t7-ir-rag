# Device for locking a beam to an upright, for example in a pallet rack.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a device for locking a beam 11 to an upright 10 . The beam is provided with hooks 14 meant to be inserted into holes 16 in the upright and be locked by a cylinder 18 being a part of a spring activated lock device 17 . The lock device can be extracted and moved to a position in which a first stop surface 19 of the device rests on the outside of the beam below the hole 16 . When the beam is being removed the lock device is moved to a position such that a second stop surface 22 of the lock device on insertion of the beam into an upright moves the cylinder 18 to a locking position.
