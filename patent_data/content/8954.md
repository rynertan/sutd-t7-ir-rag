# Computerized test system for testing an electrical harness and a method of testing an electrical harness.

## Abstract
A microcomputer based system which provides a method of electrical harness fabrication and testing. Each connector into which the harness will be wired is mounted on a receptacle containing a multiplex transponder 12 , a plurality of which are in turn connected in parallel through a common data ribbon cable 10 to a controlling computer 11 . A video display 26 is provided for interaction between an operator and the computer 11 . As each wire is connected between the appropriate connector pins, the computer 11 through the cable 10 and multiplex transponders 12 , measures the connection resistance. Error meassages and wiring information are displayed. Each multiplex transpon der 12 comprises a plurality of analog multiplexer demul tiplexer parts for connecting a common transmit data line in the connecting cable 10 to any predetermined connector pin, and for connecting any connector pin to the common receive line of the connecting cable 10 to allow testing the resistance between any electrical points. As a system initial ization step, the computer automatically codes each multip lex transponder 12 with a unique address so that a plurality of otherwise identical multiplex transponders on the form board may be indentified by the computer 11 .
