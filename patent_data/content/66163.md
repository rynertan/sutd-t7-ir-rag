# Electrochemical cell shunting switch assemblies.

## Abstract
An electrical shunting switch assembly 12 for use with a high continuous D.C. current electrochemical cell system 10 , for electrically shunting or by passing a cell 10b of the system to permit maintenance or replacement, and then permitting stepped or gradual current diversion back through the cell 10b . This shunting switch assembly 12 includes a plurality of electrically parallel switch modules 22 which comprises a vacuum switch S , a series con nected resistance value R and switch operating means for sequentially operating the switches S for current diversion. The switch modules 22 are disposed in a matrix arrange ment connected between bus connectors 14, 16 which are connectable across the cell 10b , with switch modules 22 having a low resistance value Ra, Rc in alternating adjacent relationship to switch modules having a high resistance value Rb, Rd . The low resistance value modules 22a, 22c permit high shunting efficiency. The higher resistance value modules 22b, 22d provide the capability for stepped or gradual current diversion.
