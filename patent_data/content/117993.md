# ROTARY FLOW DISTRIBUTOR FOR INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES

## Abstract
The invention is concerned with a rotary flow distributor for internal combustion engines. The flow distributor com prises a hollow cylinder 17 whose interior is divided into plural chambers, the engine intake mixture and exhaust gases being flown through said chambers. The distributor cylinder 17 is located above and communicates with the engine combustion chambers 22 through ports 23 and hollow sealing elements 31 interposed between the distri butor cylinder 17 and combustion chambers to provide a seal during the rotation of the cylinder 17 .
