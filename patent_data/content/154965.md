# Internal grinding machine.

## Abstract
An internal grinding machine comprising a work head adapted to rotate about a selected axis and to be displaced in a direction perpendicular to that axis. The work head in cludes a workpiece holding fixture having a fixed lower jaw and an upper jaw displaceable from an open position to a closed position for clamping the outer periphery of a cy lindrical workpiece having a longitudinally extending slot along the length thereof. The fixed jaw has a longitudinally extending key to be located within the keyway of the work piece. A grinding spindle adapted to be rotated about and displaced along its axis includes a grinding wheel having a plurality of annular, outwardly projecting tapered grinding portions for effecting stock removal from a clamped work piece and cutting the workpiece into a selected number of annular rings, as the workpiece holding fixture is advanced relative to the grinding wheel from a start position to a finish position. The longitudinally extending key has slots through which the grinding portions are fed as the workpiece hold ing fixture is displaced from the start position to the finish position. The fixed jaw and the movable jaw each have a clamping surface including a plurality of annular grooves for receiving the outwardly projecting grinding portions of the grinding wheel when the workpiece holding fixture has been advanced to the finish position.
