## Description
This invention relates to DNA sequences, recombinant DNA molecules and processes for producing at least one human lipocortin. More particularly, the invention relates to DNA sequences and recombinant DNA molecules that are characterized in that they code for at least one human lipocortin like polypeptide. Accordingly, hosts transformed with these sequences may be employed in the processes of this invention to produce the human lipocortin like polypeptides of this invention. These polypeptides possess anti inflammatory activity and are useful in the treatment of arthritic, allergic, dermatologic, ophthalmic and collagen diseases. Arachidonic acid is an unsaturated fatty acid that is a precursor in the synthesis of compounds, such as prostaglandins, hydroxy acids and leukotrienes, that are involved in inflammation reac tions. It is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A₂ activity. In response to anti inflammatory agents, such as glucocorticoids, certain cells release proteins that have been characterized To date, several phospholipase A₂ inhibitory proteins have been studied. One of them lipomodulin has been characterized as an about 40,000 molecular weight protein that is probably degraded by proteases in the cell to two smaller active species of about 30,000 and 15,000 molecular weight F. Hirata et al., Identification Of Several Species Of Phospholipase Inhibitory Protein s By Radioimmunoassay For Lipomodulin , Although lipomodulin has been isolated from rabbit neutrophil cells, macrocortin from rat macrophages and renocortin from rat renomedullary interstitial cells, the three proteins exhibit similar biological activities, molecular weights and cross reactivity with monoclonal antibodies against lipomodulin or macrocortin. Moreover, all are induced by glucocorticoids. Thus, it has been suggested that these phospholipase inhibitory proteins, or lipocortins, are closely related to each other and are produced by cells as a general physiological mechanism of steroid action B. Rothhut et al., Further Characterization Of The Glucocorticoid Induced Anti phospholipase Protein Renocortin , Recent data have also indicated that the 15,000 molecular weight species of lipomodulin is produced by lymphocytes in response to immunogens and acts as a glycosylation inhibiting factor, inhibiting the glycosylation of IgE binding factors and leading to the suppression of the IgE response T. Uede et al., Modulation Of The Biologic Activities Of IgE Binding Factors I. Identification Of Glycosylation Inhibitory Factor As A Fragment Of Lipomodulin , As a result of their anti inflammatory activities, lipocortins are useful for the treatment of disorders involving inflammatory processes. Such disorders include arthritic, allergic, dermatologic, ophthalmic and collagen diseases. Furthermore, the use of these proteins to treat inflammation might avoid the disadvantages now associated with present anti inflammatory compounds. At present two classes of compounds are being used for anti inflammatory therapy corticosteroids and nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs. Corticosteroids are generally disfavored due to the severe side effects that may be associated with their use. These effects include hypertension, gastrointestinal bleeding, muscle weakness, cataracts and convulsions. Thus, nonsteroidal anti inflammatory compounds are preferred. However, these non steroids may also produce side effects, such as adverse effects on gastric and platelet physiology and on the central nervous system and hematopoiesis. In addition, most non steroidal anti inflammatory agents inhibit the production of inflammatory substances via their effect on only one of the two pathways for production of those substances, i.e., either the cyclooxygenase pathway or the lipoxygenase pathway. In contrast, lipocortins inhibit the production of inflammatory substances via both pathways. Furthermore, because lipocortins are only mediators of steroid action, it is unlikely that they will produce the side effects often associated with the use of corticosteroids. And because these inhibitor proteins are natural mediators produced by the cell, they are unlikely to have the side effects usually associated with many non steroid anti inflammatories. In addition, lipocortin may affect inflammation through an alternate pathway by blocking the chemotactic response of leukocytes. It has been shown that certain peptides whose sequences code for the tyrosine phosphorylation sites found within pp60 src and MT antigen, i.e., the src peptide and the MT peptide, inhibit chemotaxis of rabbit neutrophils stimulated by a chemoattractant F. Hirata et al., Inhibition Of Leukocyte Chemotaxis By Glu Glu Glu Glu Tyr Pro Met Glu And Leu Ile Glu Asp Asn Glu Tyr Thr Ala Arg Gln Gly , To date, however, human lipocortins have not been purified from cells. Furthermore, even if a procedure could be developed for the purification of lipocortins, it is doubtful that sufficient quantities of them could be produced for their many clinical and commercial applications. Accordingly, processes enabling the production of human lipocortins in clinically useful amounts would be highly advantageous in anti inflammatory therapy.

In order that the invention herein described may be more fully understood, the following detailed description is set forth. In the description the following terms are employed The present invention relates to DNA sequences and recombinant DNA molecules coding for human lipocortin like polypeptides according to claims 1 9 and processes for the production of those polypeptides. Although a variety of selection and DNA cloning techniques might potentially have been employed in our isolating and cloning of a DNA sequence of this invention, in one embodiment of the invention, we adopted a selection strategy based upon rat phospholipase A₂ inhibitor protein. Accordingly, we purified a rat phospholipase A₂ inhibitor protein from the extracellular supernatant of rat peritoneal exudate cells and determined the amino acid sequence of various fragments of that protein. Based on those protein sequences, we then synthesized several antisense oligonucleotide DNA probes corresponding to those regions of purified rat protein which had minimal nucleotide degeneracy. We then used these probes to screen a human cDNA library comprising For screening, we hybridized the oligonucleotide probes to the human cDNA library utilizing a plaque hybridization screening assay and we selected clones hybridizing to a number of our probes. After isolating and subcloning the selected human cDNA inserts into plasmids, we determined their nucleotide sequences and compared them to our amino acid sequences from peptides of purified rat lipocortin. As a result of this comparison, we found that the nucleotide sequences of all clones isolated coded for amino acid sequences that had a marked homology to the amino acid sequences of our purified rat lipocortin. Compare Figures 1 and 2 with Figure 4. We confirmed that at least one of the clones isolated contained the full length sequence encoding human lipocortin. The cDNA sequences of this invention can be operatively linked to expression control sequences and used in various mammalian or other eukaryotic or prokaryotic host cells to produce the human lipocortinlike polypeptides coded for by them. For example, we have constructed high level expression vectors for the production of a 37 Kd human lipocortin. In addition, the cDNA sequences of this invention are useful as probes to screen human cDNA libraries for other sequences coding for lipocortin like polypeptides. The cDNA sequences of this invention are also useful as probes to screen human genomic DNA libraries to select human genomic DNA sequences coding for lipocortin like polypeptides. These genomic sequences, like the above cDNA sequences of this invention, are then useful to produce the lipocortin like polypeptides coded for by them. The genomic sequences are particularly useful in transforming mammalian cells to produce human lipocortin like polypeptides. According to a second embodiment of the invention, we isolated from human placenta a human lipocortin like polypeptide which shows structural similarity, i.e., amino acid homology, to the 37 Kd recombinant lipocortin of this invention. This protein also displays phospholipase A₂ inhibitory activity. We have designated the protein, N lipocortin. Lipocortin and N lipocortin are discrete proteins that have been defined chemically by tryptic mapping. We determined the amino acid sequences of various fragments of N lipocortin and based on these sequences, we synthesized antisense oligonucleotide DNA probes. We used these probes to screen a human cDNA library comprising This cDNA sequence is useful as a probe to screen human cDNA libraries for other sequences coding for N lipocortin like polypeptides. For example, this cDNA insert can be used to screen the human placenta cDNA library of this invention for the full length sequence encoding N lipocortin. Alternatively, the oligonucleotide probes that were used to obtain the partial N lipocortin cDNA sequence of this invention are useful as probes to rescreen the placenta library for the full length sequence encoding N lipocortin. In addition, the N lipocortin cDNA sequences obtained or the probes described herein may be used to isolate other portions of the N lipocortin gene and the full length gene reconstructed by standard techniques in the art. Finally, the probes or cDNA sequences may be used as primers to synthesize full length coding sequences. The N lipocortin cDNA sequences of this invention are also useful as probes to screen human genomic DNA libraries to select human genomic DNA sequences coding for N lipocortin like polypeptides. These genomic sequences, like the N lipocortin cDNA sequences, are then useful to produce N lipocortin like polypeptides in hosts transformed with those sequences. Another embodiment of the present invention relates to the production of biologically active human lipocortin like polypeptide fragments which allow better characterization of the active site of the lipocortin protein and the design of molecules having optimal therapeutic value. Accordingly, we have generated such fragments by treatment of the lipocortin like polypeptides of this invention with various proteases. We have also generated such biologically active fragments by recombinant DNA techniques. The human lipocortin like polypeptides produced by the methods of this invention are useful as anti inflammatory agents and in anti inflammatory methods and therapies. For example, such compositions may comprise an amount of a lipocortin like polypeptide of this invention which is pharmaceutically effective to reduce inflammation and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Such therapies generally comprise a method of treating patients in a pharmaceutically acceptable manner with those compositions. A wide variety of host cloning vehicle combinations may be employed in cloning or expressing the human lipocortin like polypeptide DNA sequences prepared in accordance with this invention. For example, useful cloning or expression vehicles may consist of segments of chromosomal, non chromosomal and synthetic DNA sequences, such as various known derivatives of SV40 and known bacterial plasmids, e.g., plasmids from Within each specific cloning or expression vehicle, various sites may be selected for insertion of the human lipocortin like polypeptide DNA sequences of this invention. These sites are usually designated by the restriction endonuclease which cuts them and are well recognized by those of skill in the art. Various methods for inserting DNA sequences into these sites to form recombinant DNA molecules are also well known. These include, for example, dG dC or dA dT tailing, direct ligation, synthetic linkers, exonuclease and polymerase linked repair reactions followed by ligation, or extension of the DNA strand with DNA polymerase and an appropriate single stranded template followed by ligation. It is, of course, to be understood that a cloning or expression vehicle useful in this invention need not have a restriction endonuclease site for insertion of the chosen DNA fragment. Instead, the vehicle could be joined to the fragment by alternative means. Various expression control sequences may also be chosen to effect the expression of the DNA sequences of this invention. These expression control sequences include, for example, the For expression of the DNA sequences of this invention, these DNA sequences are operatively linked to one or more of the above described expression control sequences in the expression vector. Such operative linking, which may be effected before or after the chosen human lipocortin DNA sequence is inserted into a cloning vehicle, enables the expression control sequences to control and promote the expression of the DNA sequence. The vector or expression vehicle and, in particular, the sites chosen therein for insertion of the selected DNA fragment and the expression control sequence employed in this invention, are determined by a variety of factors, e.g., number of sites susceptible to a particular restriction enzyme, size of the protein to be expressed, expression characteristics such as the location of start and stop codons relative to the vector sequences, and other factors recognized by those of skill in the art. The choice of a vector, expression control sequence, and insertion site for a particular lipocortin sequence is determined by a balance of these factors, not all selections being equally effective for a given case. It should also be understood that the DNA sequences coding for the lipocortin like polypeptides of this invention which are inserted at the selected site of a cloning or expression vehicle may include nucleotides which are not part of the actual gene coding for the desired lipocortin or may include only a fragment of the entire gene for that protein. It is only required that whatever DNA sequence is employed, a transformed host will produce a lipocortin like polypeptide. For example, the lipocortin related DNA sequences of this invention may be fused in the same reading frame in an expression vector of this invention to at least a portion of a DNA sequence coding for at least one eukaryotic or prokaryotic carrier protein or a DNA sequence coding for at least one eukaryotic or prokaryotic signal sequence, or combinations thereof. Such constructions may aid in expression of the desired lipocortin related DNA sequence, improve purification or permit secretion, and preferably maturation, of the lipocortin like polypeptide from the host cell. The lipocortin related DNA sequence may alternatively include an ATG start codon, alone or together with other codons, fused directly to the sequence encoding the first amino acid of a mature native lipocortin like polypeptide. Such constructions enable the production of, for example, a methionyl or other peptidyl lipocortin like polypeptide that is part of this invention. This N terminal methionine or peptide may then be cleaved intra or extra cellularly by a variety of known processes or the polypeptide used together with the methionine attached to the peptide in the anti inflammatory compositions and methods of this invention. The cloning vehicle or expression vector containing the lipocortin like polypeptide coding sequences of this invention is employed in accordance with this invention to transform an appropriate host so as to permit that host to express the lipocortin like polypeptide for which the DNA sequence codes. Useful cloning or expression hosts include strains of The selection of an appropriate host is also controlled by a number of factors recognized by the art. These include, for example, compatibility with the chosen vector, toxicity of proteins encoded by the hybrid plasmid, susceptibility of the desired protein to proteolytic degradation by host cell enzymes, contamination or binding of the protein to be expressed by host cell proteins difficult to remove during purification, ease of recovery of the desired protein, expression characteristics, bio safety and cost. A balance of these factors must be struck with the understanding that not all host vector combinations may be equally effective for either the cloning or expression of a particular recombinant DNA molecule. It should be understood that the human lipocortin like polypeptides prepared in accordance with this invention in those hosts may include polypeptides in the form of fused proteins e.g., linked to a prokaryotic, eukaryotic or combination N terminal segment to direct excretion, improve stability, improve purification or improve possible cleavage of the N terminal segment , in the form of a precursor of lipocortin like polypeptides e.g., starting with all or parts of a lipocortin like polypeptide signal sequence or other eukaryotic or prokaryotic signal sequences , in the form of a mature lipocortin like polypeptide, or in the form of a met lipocortin like polypeptide. One particularly useful form of a polypeptide in accordance with this invention, or at least a precursor thereof, is a mature lipocortin like polypeptide with an easily cleaved amino acid or series of amino acids attached to the amino terminus. Such construction allows synthesis of the protein in an appropriate host, where a start signal that may not be present in the mature lipocortin is needed, and then cleavage The polypeptides of this invention also include biologically active polypeptide fragments derived from lipocortin like polypeptides by treatment with proteases or by expression of a fragment of the DNA sequence which codes for a lipocortin like polypeptide. The polypeptides of the invention also include lipocortin like polypeptides that are coded for on expression by DNA sequences characterized by different codons for some or all of the codons of the present DNA sequences. These substituted codons may code for amino acids identical to those coded for by the codons replaced but result in higher yield of the polypeptide. Alternatively, the replacement of one or a combination of codons leading to amino acid replacement or to a longer or shorter lipocortin like polypeptide may alter its properties in a useful way e.g., increase the stability, increase the solubility or increase the therapeutic activity . In order that this invention may be better understood, the following examples are set forth. These examples are for purposes of illustration only and are not to be construed as limiting the scope of the invention in any manner. We injected male Wistar rats 200 250 kg subcutaneously with 0.1 ml of the glucocorticoid, dexamethasone phosphate 1.25 mg kg rat in 0.9 NaCl to induce production of phospholipase A₂ inhibitor protein. We then sacrificed the rats one hour after injection by intra cardiac injection with Euthasate and washed the peritoneal cavities with 10 ml of phosphate buffered saline 50 mM KH₂PO₄, pH 7.3, 150 mM NaCl containing 2 U ml heparin and 50 µM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride . After we cleared the lavages of cells and other particulate matter by centrifugation in an International centrifuge at top speed for 30 min, we assayed the combined supernatants for lipocortin by measuring the inhibition of release of labeled oleic acid from autoclaved We performed this We prepared the substrate ³H oleic acid labeled After the brief incubation of substrate autoclaved labeled We then pelleted the To purify the lipocortin from the above described peritoneal exudate supernatant, we first added additional protease inhibitors to the supernatant. These typically included aprotinin 20 µg ml , soybean trypsin inhibitor 20 µg ml and EGTA ethyleneglycol bis aminoethyl ether N,N tetraacetic acid 0.5 mM . We incubated the exudate at 37 C for 1 h in the presence of 0.1 U ml calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase and concentrated it two fold by ultrafiltration to a final protein concentration of 5 mg ml using an Amicon apparatus PM10 membrane . We next dialyzed the supernatant overnight at 4 C against 40 volumes of 20 mM Tris HCl pH 8.1 and subjected it to DE52 ion exchange column chromatography Whatman Ltd., column dimensions 1 cm dia. x 17 cm . Prior to use, we had equilibrated the DE52 resin with 25 mM Tris HCl pH 8.1 . We collected the flow through fractions and concentrated them an additional 25 fold by Amicon ultrafiltration PM10 membrane . We then subjected the concentrate to a gel filtration column P150 resin in 25 mM Tris HCl column dimensions 2.5 cm dia. x 40 cm and monitored the column fractions for protein using absorbance at 280 nm and using the phospholipase inhibitory activity assay described above. We detected peak activity at 35 40,000 molecular weight. We lyophilized these high activity fractions, dialyzed them against 25 mM Tris HCl pH 6.8 containing 0.2 SDS and analyzed them using a preparative SDS polyacrylamide gel main gel 15 acrylamide, 0.08 methylene bisacrylamide stacking gel 7.6 acrylamide, 0.21 methylene bisacrylamide . The gel analysis yielded four major protein bands. According to a modification of the Western blotting technique H. Towbin et al., Electrophoretic Transfer Of Proteins From Polyacrylamide Gels To Nitrocellulose Sheets , We then digested the protein either with cyanogen bromide or with trypsin. When utilizing cyanogen bromide digestion, we digested the pellets containing approximately 100 µg protein with 200 mg ml of cyanogen bromide in the dark for 16 h at 25 C in 0.5 ml of 70 formic acid. We then diluted the reaction mixture 15 fold with water and lyophilized it. When utilizing tryptic digestion, we first resuspended the pellets in 0.1 M NH₄HCO₃ plus 0.1 mM CaCl₂, carboxymethylated the mixture with iodoacetic acid and then incubated it with trypsin for 24 h at 37 C. During this incubation, we added trypsin three times to a final concentration of 1.5 of total protein at time zero, 2.5 after 4 h and 3.5 after 19 h. We resolved the cleavage fragments from these digestions by high pressure liquid chromatography using a C8 column Brownlee RP 3 for the cyanogen bromide digestion products and using a C18 column Spectraphysics for the tryptic digestion products, utilizing in both cases a gradient of acetonitrile from 0 75 in 0.l trifluoroacetic acid to elute bound fragments. We then subjected the peak fractions to sequence analysis using a gas phase sequencer Applied Biosystems 470A . PITH amino acids were analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography on a 5 µm cyanocolumn Hypersil , using a gradient of acetonitrile methanol 4 1 from 15 55 in 0.02 M sodium acetate pH 5.7 . Figure 1 shows the amino acid sequences of the fragments produced by cyanogen bromide digestion of our purified rat lipocortin. Of six major peaks, only three yielded unique sequences CNBr l, 2 and 3 . These sequences are shown at the bottom of Figure l. Of the remaining peaks, two CNBr 5 and 6 contained mixtures of fragments and thus could not be sequenced, and peak 4 was a column artifact from which no protein was detected. Figure 2 shows the amino acid sequences of fragments from tryptic digestion. Although tryptic digestion produced over forty peaks, the amino acid sequences of only nine fractions are shown in Figure 2. In instances where peaks contained more than one peptide, the appropriate fractions were subjected to a second chromatography step. T22a and T22b are sequences derived from the two components of peak 22 which were resolved when peak 22 was rechromatographed on the same column but at a neutral pH. Having determined the amino acid sequences of various regions of a rat lipocortin see Figures 1 and 2 , we chemically synthesized four pools of antisense oligonucleotide DNA probes that coded for some of those protein sequences see Figure 3 . We decided to synthesize the four pools shown in Figure 3 because they corresponded to regions of the rat lipocortin that have minimal nucleic acid degeneracy. For each amino acid sequence, we synthesized mixtures of probes complementary to all possible codons. Furthermore, we synthesized the probes such that they were complementary to the DNA sequences which code for the amino acid sequence, i.e., the probes were antisense, to enable the probes to recognize the corresponding sequences in mRNA as well as in DNA. The amino acid sequences of the four selected regions of the rat lipocortin and all the possible nucleotide codon combinations that encode them are shown in Figure 3. Coding degeneracies are indicated as follows N C, T, A, or G R A or G Y C or T and H A, C, or T. Two pools of the probes, derived from sequences in the tryptic fragments T22a and T24 of Figure 2, are 20 mers with 48 and 256 fold degeneracies, respectively. The other two probe pools are l7 mers with 64 and l28 fold degeneracies. To reduce further the degeneracies in the probes, we also prepared each pool in subpools, e.g., we prepared the 48 fold degenerate 20 mer of T22a in three subpools of l6 and synthesized the other probes in four subpools. The probes in each pool were end labeled with ³²P using γ ³²P ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. To test if our synthetic probes actually recognized human sequences, we hybridized the four subpools of T24 to GeneScreen filters containing poly A mRNA from the human macrophage cell line U937, which had been induced with 10 ⁷M PMA 4β phorbol 12β myristate 13α acetate and 10 ⁵ dexamethasone, utilizing the Northern blotting technique H. Lehrach et al., We constructed a human cDNA library from poly A mRNA isolated from human macrophage cell line U937. The cDNA sequences were inserted into λgtl0 and amplified in We induced human macrophage U937 cells in culture with dexamethasone l0 ⁵ M and phorbol ester l0 ⁷ M and resuspended pellets containing 1.2 x 10⁹ cells in 48 ml lysis buffer 0.2 M Tris HCl pH 8.0 , 0.l M LiCl, 25 mM EDTA, l SDS plus 5 mM vanadyl complex Bethesda Research Labs by vortexing. We lysed the cells by addition of 24 ml phenol and vortexed for 5 min. We added 24 ml chloroform to the lysis mixture which was then shaken for l0 min. We separated the organic and aqueous phases by centrifugation in a clinical centrifuge at room temperature for l0 min. We reextracted the aqueous phase two times with phenol chloroform l l , then two times with chloroform only. We next ethanol precipitated the nucleic acids in 0.3 M sodium acetate at 20 C overnight and pelleted the nucleic acid at l4k rpm in a Sorvall RC2B centrifuge SS34 rotor at 4 C for 20 min. We resuspended the pellets in 5 ml of 0.3 M sodium acetate buffer, and ethanol precipitated the nucleic acid again as described above. We resuspended the final pellet in 300 µl H₂O and stored it at 20 C. This RNA preparation was enriched for poly A RNA by passage over an oligo dT cellulose column PL Biochem . We synthesized cDNA from 20 µg poly A mRNA isolated as described above. We diluted the poly A mRNA to 500 µg ml in H₂O, heated it to 65 C for 3 min, quick cooled it in a dry ice propanol bath and then thawed it. The RNA was then added to a reaction mixture composed of 0.l M Tris HCl pH 8.3 at 42 C, 0.0l M MgCl₂, 0.0l M DTT, l mM dCTP, 1 mM dGTP, 1 mM dTTP, 0.5 mM dATP and l00 µCi α ³²P ATP 3000 Ci mmole, Amersham or New England Nuclear , 20 µg oligo dT ₁₂ ₁₈ PL Biochem , 0.03 M β mercaptoethanol, 5 mM Vanadyl Ribonucleoside Complex Bethesda Research Labs , l69 U AMV Reverse Transcriptase Seikagaku America . Final volume of the reaction mixture was 200 µl. We incubated this mixture for 2 min at room temperature and 6 h at 44 C. We terminated the reaction by addition of l l0 vol 0.5 M Na₂EDTA pH 8.0 . We adjusted the reaction mixture to 0.l5 M NaOH and incubated the mixture at 37 C for l2 h followed by neutralization with l l0 vol l M Tris HCl pH 8.0 and HCl. This was extracted with phenol chloroform saturated TE buffer 10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.0 and 1 mM Na₂EDTA . The aqueous phase was chromatographed through a 5 ml sterile plastic pipet containing a 7 x 29 cm bed of Sephadex Gl50 in 0.0l M pH 7.4 , 0.4 M NaCl, 0.0l M Na₂EDTA, 0.05 SDS. We pooled the front peak minus tail and precipitated the cDNA with 2.5 vol 95 ethanol at 20 C. This reaction yielded l µg of single stranded cDNA. We resuspended the single stranded cDNA in 200 µl final vol 0.l M Hepes pH 6.9 , 0.0l M MgCl₂, 0.0025 M DTT, 0.07 M KCl, l mM dXTPs and 75 U Klenow fragment DNA polymerase l Boehringer Mannheim and incubated the reaction mixture at l4 C for 21 h. Reaction was terminated by addition of Na₂EDTA pH 8.0 to 0.0l25 M, extracted with phenol chloroform, as in the first cDNA step, and the aqueous phase was chromatographed on a G150 column in 0.0l M Tris HCl pH 7.4 , 0.l M NaCl, 0.0l M Na₂EDTA, 0.05 SDS. We again pooled the radioactive peak minus the tail and ethanol precipitated the DNA. We then incubated the DNA obtained with 42 U reverse transcriptase in 50 µl 0.l M Tris HCl pH 8.3 , 0.0l M MgCl₂, 0.0l M DTT, 0.l M KCl, l mM dXTPS, 0.03 M β mercaptoethanol for l h at 37 C to complete double strand synthesis. The reaction was terminated and processed as described above. We cleaved the hairpin loop formed during double strand synthesis as follows We redissolved the pellet in 50 µl 0.03 M sodium acetate pH 4.5 , 0.3 M NaCl, 0.003 M ZnCl₂ and treated it with l00 U S₁ nuclease Sigma for 30 min at room temperature. Reaction was terminated by addition of EDTA and processed as described above. The yield after S₁ treatment was 900 ng dsDNA. To assure blunt ends following S₁ nuclease digestion, we treated the DNA with Klenow in 0.0l M Tris HCl pH 7.4 , 0.0l M MgCl₂, l mM DTT, 0.05 M NaCl, 80 µM dXTP and l2.5 U Klenow in 60 µl for 90 min at l4 C, extracted with 50 50 phenol chloroform, and chromatographed the DNA on a G50 spin column l ml syringe in 0.0l M Tris HCl pH 7.4 , 0.l M NaCl, 0.0l M EDTA, 0.05 SDS. We next methylated the dsDNA by treating the DNA with We ligated the 900 ng cDNA to phosphorylated We adjusted the reaction to 0.l M Tris HCl pH 7.5 , 0.05 M NaCl, 5 mM MgCl₂, l00 µg ml BSA, l25 U We redissolved cDNA in l00 µl 0.0l M Tris HCl pH 7.5 , 0.l M NaCl, l mM EDTA and chromatographed it on a l x 50 cm Biogel A50 BIORAD column which had been extensively washed in the same buffer to remove ligation inhibitors . Aliquots of fractions were run on a l agarose gel in TBE buffer 0.089 M Tris HCl, 0.089 M boric acid and 2.5 mM Na₂EDTA , dried and exposed at 70 C overnight. We pooled all fractions that were larger than 500 base pairs and ethanol precipitated the DNA for cloning into an We incubated 5 µg We next infected For plating and amplification of the library, 1 ml of cells plus 250 µl packaging mix was incubated at room temperature for 15 min, diluted to 50 ml in LB plus MgSO₄ top agarose at 50 C and plated on LB Mg Nunc plates. This represented a plaque density of 2 x 10⁵ plate. The plates were incubated at 37 C for approximately 8 h until plaques were nearly touching. We flooded the plates with 50 ml of cold SM buffer 0.0l M Tris HCl pH 7.5 , 0.0l M MgCl₂, 0.l mM Na₂EDTA and eluted on a gyro rotary shaker overnight at 4 C. We pooled the eluants into 250 ml bottles and spun at 6k for l0 min in a Sorvall GSA rotor. We treated the supernatants with an equal volume of cold 20 , PEG 4000 2 M NaCl in ice for 3 h and pelleted the phages by centrifugation at 4k for 30 min in an H4000 rotor in an RC 3B Sorvall centrifuge. The phage pellets were thoroughly drained, resuspended in 60 ml SM, and spun at l0,000 rpm in a SS34 rotor to remove debris. The supernatants were adjusted to 3.5 M CsCl by addition of 7 g CsCl to l0 ml supernatant. We obtained phage bands by centrifugation in a 70.l Beckman rotor at 50,000 rpm for l8 h at l5 C. We pooled the phage bands and stored them at 4 C for library stock. The titer obtained was 2.2 x l0¹³ PFU ml. We screened the library with our labeled oligonucleotide probes, pools 2 and 3, for lipocortin sequences using the plaque hydridization screening technique of Woo S. L. C. Woo, A Sensitive And Rapid Method For Recombinant Phage Screening , in An overnight culture of C600 hfl cells in L broth and 0.2 maltose was pelleted and resuspended in an equal volume of SM buffer. We pre adsorbed 0.9 ml of cells with 2 x l0⁵ phage particles at room temperature for l5 min. We diluted the suspension to 50 ml in LB plus l0 mM MgSO₄ and 0.7 agarose at 55 C and plated it on LB Mg Nunc plates. We screened 10 such plates. We incubated the plates at 37 C for approximately 8 h until plaques were nearly touching. We then chilled the plates at 4 C for 1 h to allow the agarose to harden. We presoaked GeneScreen Plus filters in a 1 10 dilution of the overnight These filters were then lysed by placing them onto a pool of 0.5 N NaOH for 5 min, then neutralized on l M Tris HCl pH 7.0 , submerged into l M Tris HCl pH 7.0 and scrubbed clean of cell debris. We prehybridized and hybridized the filters to the oligonucleotide probes 2 and 3 in 0.2 polyvinyl pyrrolidone M.W. 40,000 , 0.2 ficoll M.W. 40,000 , 0.2 bovine serum albumin, 0.05 M Tris HCl pH 7.5 , l M sodium chloride, 0.l sodium pyrophosphate, l SDS, l0 dextran sulfate M.W. 500,000 and denatured salmon sperm DNA l00 µg ml according to manufacturer s specifications New England Nuclear for plaque screen membranes . We detected hybridizing λ cDNA sequences by autoradiography. By means of this technique, we picked 20 positive plaques and rescreened at lower density using the same probes. We isolated the DNA of these clones, digested with We restricted the DNAs of these phages with A 480 base pair These clones contain cDNA sequences having an uninterrupted open reading frame that can code for 363 amino acids see Figure 4 . We believe that the initiating ATG codon for lipocortin may be the ATG located at nucleotides 52 54 of Figure 4. However, the DNA sequence of our clone, reported in Figure 4, may be lacking one or more codons coding for amino acids at the N terminal end of native lipocortin. These potential missing codons may be isolated, if necessary, by one of skill in the art using conventional hybridization conditions from our libraries, or other libraries, of genomic DNA and cDNA using as probes our clones, or more preferably portions of the 5 terminal end of those clones. Full length clones may then be prepared using conventional ligation techniques and our lipocortin coding clones. We confirmed that clone λLC of Figure 4 contains the full length gene for lipocortin. To confirm that the ATG at nucleotides 52 54 in the λLC cDNA Figure 4 is the first in frame methionine codon and thus the initiating methionine, we determined the 5 sequence of the lipocortin mRNA by primer extension. A 27 oligonucleotide lipo 18 homologous to the sequence 10 to 37 of λLC was labelled with ³²P γ ATP and hybridized to human placental poly A RNA. Using this oligonucleotide as a primer and AMV reverse transcriptase, we transcribed a 60 base pair fragment of the most 5 end of the lipocortin mRNA. This fragment was gel purified and sequenced by the Maxam and Gilbert sequencing technique To exclude the possibility that the mRNA was in fact longer than our primer extension indicated, but instead had a strong stop signal for reverse transcriptase which we mistook for the 5 end, we determined the exact size of the mRNA. An oligonucleotide lipo 17 that is homologous to sequence 94 to 128 of λLC was hybridized to placental poly A RNA and digested with RNase H. RNase H digests RNA only when in a hybrid with DNA and thus it introduced a defined cleavage in the mRNA at the site where lipo 17 hybridised. This RNA was then separated on a sequencing gel, blotted onto Gene Screen and probed with ³²P labelled lipo 18. This enabled us to determine the exact size of the 5 end of the lipocortin mRNA, which agreed with the size obtained by primer extension. The cDNA sequences of this invention can be further utilized to screen human genomic cosmid or phage libraries to isolate human genomic sequences encoding human lipocortin like polypeptides. These human cDNA and genomic sequences can be used to transform eukaryotic and prokaryotic host cells by techniques well known in the art to produce human lipocortin like polypeptides in clinically and commercially useful amounts. It should also be understood that the cDNA sequences of the invention may be contained in larger mRNA species which result from alternate splicing. Such mRNAs may encode a signal sequence for lipocortin in addition to the mature protein. Plasmid pKK233.LIP.1 which contains a partial sequence of the lipocortin coding region was constructed by a three part ligation using Transformants resulting from this ligation and subsequent transformation into We have also constructed various expression vectors in For example, Figure 6 depicts plasmid pLiptrc155A, a pLiptrc155A ATCC Deposit No. 68763 was constructed as follows The resulting pLiptrc155A expression vector was then used to transform To further verify that we were expressing the human lipocortin, the same lysates were also subjected to Western blot analysis using antibody raised against the rat lipocortin. Only the 37 Kd protein was immunoreactive with the antibody against the rat protein. We have also shown by Western blot analysis that the natural human lipocortin from U937 cells detected by its immunoreactivity with the anti rat protein antibody is virtually identical in size with the 37 Kd protein we expressed, banding in the same place on the gel. Finally, a small amount of the expressed protein was electroeluted out of an SDS polyacrylamide gel and subjected to N terminal sequence analysis. The amino acid sequence obtained was consistent with the predicted amino acid sequence of the λLC cDNA sequence of Figure 4. The human lipocortin which we expressed inhibited exogenous phospholipase A2 in the Although inhibitory activity could be detected directly in the soluble lysate, most of the 37 Kd protein in In addition to pLiptrc155A, we constructed other high level expression vectors of this invention. For example, plasmid pLipPLT4A was constructed as follows plasmid pPLT4HTNF, a gift from Walter Fiers, this plasmid is identical to the plasmid deposited in the culture collection of the Deutsche Sammlung Von Mikroorganismen, in Gottingen, West Germany, on December 27, 1984 under DSM No. 3175 and which was deposited within We transformed We have also constructed expression vectors for the production of human lipocortin in yeast. Figures 7 9 show the construction of pBgl20 which, when used to transform yeast cells, expressed human lipocortin as detected by Western blot analysis with the anti rat lipocortin antibody. We constructed pBgl20 as follows In order to reconstitute the ATG initiation codon of the actin gene on pLXV l, we digested pLXV l Figure 8 shows the insertion of the DNA sequences coding for human lipocortin into a yeast expression vector. The human lipocortin sequence was cloned in two parts. First, the N terminal region was inserted behind and operatively linked to the yeast actin expression control sequence. Plasmid pTrp32l R. Devos et al., Molecular cloning of human interleukin 2 cDNA and its expression in We next digested pAPN with We obtained the DNA sequences corresponding to the remaining C terminal fragment of the human lipocortin from the 800bp We detected in extracts of yeast transformed with pBg120 a 37 Kd protein not observed in untransformed yeast cells or in yeast cells transformed with plasmids which did not contain the human lipocortin gene. This protein corresponded exactly on SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to the human 37 Kd protein produced in In yeast the human 37 Kd protein is produced as a soluble protein. It accounts for about 4 of the total cellular protein. When yeast cultures containing the recombinant protein were lysed with a french pressure cell at 20,000 p.s.i. and particulate matter removed by centrifugation l0,000 x g, l0 min approximately 80 of the inhibitory activity was recovered in the soluble fraction. The distribution of inhibitory activity correlated exactly with the distribution of the human protein based on SDS polyacrylamide gel analysis. The recombinant protein produced in yeast has a blocked amino terminus. We have also constructed expression vectors for the production of human lipocortin in mammalian hosts. Figures 11 13 show the construction of pSVL9l09 which, when transfected into cos and CHO host cells by the CaPO₄ procedure F. Graham et al., We next inserted the coding sequence for human lipocortin into pAT.SV2.TPA. An oligonucleotide of 29 bp with Figure 13 shows the insertion of the gene for human lipocortin into pAT.SV2.TPA to form a mammalian expression vector of this invention. The human lipocortin sequence was cloned into the expression vector in two parts. First, the N terminal region was inserted behind the SV40 promoter and then the C terminal region was added. The plasmid pLPO905 was cut with The C terminal region of human lipocortin is found within the 800 bp Thus, utilizing the DNA sequences of the invention, we have constructed high level expression vectors for the expression of human lipocortin in a biologically active form. Recombinant DNA sequences prepared by the processes described herein are exemplified by a culture deposited in the culture collection of In Vitro International, Inc., Ann Arbor, Michigan. The culture was deposited on January 9, 1985 and is identified as follows The production of polypeptide fragments smaller than the 37,000 molecular weight human lipocortin which display phospholipase inhibitory activity is highly desirable. A smaller polypeptide is more easily delivered to target cells by, e.g., transdermal infusion rather than intravenous injection. A smaller polypeptide might also have a more stable conformation than the 37K protein. For example, the N terminal end of the 37K protein contains a cluster of hydrophobic amino acids, which may cause the formation of intermolecular aggregates, while the C terminal end contains four cysteines capable of forming improper disulfide linkages see Fig. 4 . Thus removal of the N terminal and C terminal ends of the large protein may avoid conformational heterogeneity when the protein is produced in high concentrations. Isolation of biologically active fragments will also permit better characterization of the active site of the lipocortin molecule and lead to the design of fragments with optimal therapeutic value. Although a variety of methods can be used for generation of polypeptide fragments from their parent molecule in accordance with this aspect of our invention, we chose to subject the human lipocortin like polypeptide to limited protease digestion in the illustrative embodiment described below. We first optimized digestion conditions for each protease so that the fragments generated were few in number, usually less than ten, and therefore easily isolated. The optimum conditions were in general determined by the following factors 1 the type of protease used 2 the physical state of the target protein, i.e., denaturing or non denaturing conditions 3 the time period for digestion 4 the temperature 5 the amount of protease used and 6 the pH. We used two different types of proteases to digest our 37K lipocortin like polypeptide. The first type hydrolyzes peptide bonds non specifically. This type is represented by elastase and proteinase K proteases. The second type, represented by the proteases plasmin and thrombin, hydrolyzes a specific peptide bond. This second type probably recognizes target proteins both by amino acid sequence and by conformation surrounding the cleavage sites. We also used trypsin, a third type of protease, to localize the C terminal end of the active peptide fragments see pp. 48 49, In order to optimize conditions for plasmin digestion, we incubated an aliquot of our Using the digestion conditions described Fractions of the Biogel P 60 column chromatography were assayed for phospholipase A₂ inhibitory activity, as described We also isolated the two cleavage products by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography with a gradient of acetonitrile from 0 75 in 0.1 trifluoroacetic acid using C₄ column chromatography Vydac . Lipo S was eluted with 38 acetonitrile and Lipo L with 48 acetonitrile. We determined the N terminal amino acid sequence of Lipo L 33K peak I by sequential Edman degradation using a gas phase sequencer Applied Biosystems 470A . PTH amino acids were analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography on a 5 µm cyanocolumn Hypersil using a gradient of acetonitrile methanol 4 1 from 15 55 in 0.02M sodium acetate buffer pH 5.7 . We determined the N terminal amino acid sequence of Lipo L to be H₂N Gly Gly Pro Gly Ser Ala Val. The N terminal glycine of Lipo L corresponds to Gly 30 of the 37K protein. To determine the C terminal amino acid sequence of our fragments, we compared the tryptic peptide map of the 37K rat lipocortin Figure 16 with a tryptic peptide map which we generated for each of the fragments. We diluted 20 µl of the 37K lipocortin like polypeptide 40 µg in 0.2M Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 5mM EDTA, 0.1 mg bovine serum albumin ml with 0.2 ml of 0.1M NH₄HCO₃ plus 1mM CaCl₂. The mixture was then incubated with trypsin for 24 hr. at 37 C. During this incubation, we added trypsin at three time points 0.5 µg at time zero, 0.25 µg after 4 hr. and 0.25 µg after 19 hr. The digestion was stopped by adding 10 µl of 90 formic acid to the reaction mixture. We digested the plasmin fragments using identical conditions, except that we first dried down the fragments, which had been purified from high pressure liquid chromatography, with a Speedvac concentrator Savant , and dissolved the residues in 0.1M NH₄HCO₃ and 1mM CaCl₂. We resolved the tryptic fragments by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography with a gradient of acetonitrile from 0 75 in 0.1 trifluoroacetic acid on a C₁₈ column Spectraphysics . We then determined the amino acid sequence of each of the peak fractions. First, we established the amino acid composition of each peak by hydrolyzing the peptides in 6N HCl for 24 hr. and determining the composition on a Beckman 6300 amino acid analyzer. We compared the observed compositions with predicted compositions based on sequence data of all possible fragments from the 37K polypeptide and assigned identifications to each peak. We also determined the amino acid sequence of some of the peaks directly by sequence analysis. By comparing the map of fragment Lipo L Figure 17B with that of 37K polypeptide Figure 16 , we concluded that the biologically active Lipo L fragment has the same C terminal amino acid sequence as that of the 37K polypeptide. Therefore, this data, when combined with our N terminal sequence data, demonstrate that Lipo L contains amino acid residues 30 to 346 of the 37K polypeptide. By comparing the peptide maps of fragment Lipo S Figure 17A with that of the 37K polypeptide, we concluded that Lipo S contains amino acid residues 1 to 29 of the 37K protein. We treated 50 µl of the 37K human lipocortin like polypeptide 75 µg , 0.2M Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA, 0.1 mg bovine serum albumin ml, with 2.5 µg 1 µg µl in 10mM ammonium acetate, pH 6.0 of elastase Sigma at room temperature. We analyzed the digestion products at different time intervals as described We incubated 150 µg of the 37K polypeptide with 5 µg of elastase under optimum conditions as described above and subjected the digested polypeptides to SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis D. A. Hager and R. R. Burgess, We then purified the major active fragments e 1, e 4, and e 5 of Figure 18 by preparative SDS gel electrophoresis. We visualized the polypeptide bands by soaking the gel in 0.25M KCl and excised the biologically active polypeptide bands. We electroeluted the fragments using standard techniques M. W. Hunkapiller, E. Lujan, F. Ostrader and L. E. Hood, We determined the N terminal and C terminal amino acid sequences of e 1, e 4 and e 5. The purified fragments all showed the identical N terminal amino acid sequence H₂N Gly Gly Pro Gly Ser Ala Val Ser Pro Tyr. This N terminal glycine corresponds to Gly 30 of the 37K protein. Figure 19 shows the tryptic peptide maps of these purified fragments. We compared these maps with that of the 37K protein Figure 16 and found that the 18K e 5 fragment lacked the tryptic fragment Ala Leu Tyr Glu Ala Gly Glu Arg residues 205 212 of the 37K protein and all fragments beyond this peptide. This suggests that cleavage is before this peptide. The peptide map contains the fragment Asn Ala Leu Leu Ser Leu Ala Lys residues 178 185 of the 37K protein . Thus, the C terminus of this fragment is between Lys 185 and Arg 212 of the 37K protein. Similarly, the peptide map of the 20K e 4 fragment contains all the fragments found in the 18K fragment plus an additional peptide Ala Leu Tyr Glu Ala Gly Glu Arg Arg Lys residues 205 214 of the 37K protein . The C terminal end of this fragment is therefore between Lys 214 and Arg 228 of the 37K protein. The C terminal end of the 33K e 1 fragment is located between Lys 337 and Asn 346 of the 37K protein. Thus, we have isolated at least three biologically active peptide fragments of the 37K lipocortin like polypeptide. All three fragments have identical N terminal ends, beginning with Gly 30 of the 37K polypeptide, each ending at a different point along the 37K molecule. All three show the phospholipase A2 inhibitory activity of the full size lipocortin like polypeptide. Although we used the above methods for production of polypeptide fragments from human lipocortin like polypeptide produced in An alternative method of generating lipocortin like polypeptide fragments by recombinant DNA techniques is to introduce into the DNA sequence encoding lipocortin codons which, upon expression of the DNA sequence in the form of the polypeptide, result in sites at which the polypeptide can be cleaved e.g., chemically or proteolytically . These codons can be introduced into the DNA by various techniques known in the art such as mutagenesis or insertion. Thus, an altered lipocortin like polypeptide is produced by the host cell, purified in the same manner as the unaltered full length polypeptide and cleaved to yield a desired fragment or fragments. Using this strategy, we have altered the lipocortin DNA sequence of the present invention to produce altered polypeptides which when cleaved According to one embodiment of this technique, we constructed DNA sequences that code for altered lipocortin like polypeptides by modifying the DNA sequence of lipocortin to introduce methionine codons into the sequence. Upon expression of this sequence in a host cell, altered lipocortin like polypeptides were produced having either a specific amino acid replaced by a methionine or an inserted methionine at a particular site along the polypeptide sequence. Treatment of these altered polypeptides with cyanogen bromide, which cleaves polypeptides specifically at methionine residues, yielded lipocortin like polypeptide fragments having phospholipase A₂ inhibitory activity. We have found that the natural human lipocortin protein has only two methionine residues at amino acids 56 and 127 which are contained within the biologically active elastase fragments described in Example G 2 above. Since cleavage of a lipocortin like polypeptide with cyanogen bromide inactivated the polypeptide and any fragments produced thereby, we inferred that one or both of these methionines were necessary for the biological activity of the protein. Thus, a preliminary step in the production of active lipocortin like polypeptide fragments by cyanogen bromide treatment required the replacement of these two methionines with another amino acid without destroying the biological activity of the lipocortin protein. We therefore replaced methionines 56 and 127 with leucine residues and obtained a biologically active polypeptide fragment upon treatment with cyanogen bromide. We replaced methionines 56 and 127 by mutagenesis of the DNA sequence encoding lipocortin as follows We restricted plasmid pLiptrc155A, which contains the DNA sequence encoding lipocortin, with the restriction enzyme We screened the transformants for those colonies containing an altered lipocortin DNA sequence by hybridization with ³²P labeled oligonucleotides Lipo 60 and 61 as follows We transferred the colonies to a nitrocellulose filter and placed the filter colony side up on a fresh LB ampicillin plate. We incubated the plate for 4 h at 37 C. We then transferred the filter to a fresh LB plate containing ampicillin and chloramphenicol 250 µg ml and incubated the plate overnight at 37 C. We lysed the colonies with 0.5 M NaOH 1.5 M NaCl and neutralized the lysate twice with 0.5 M Tris HCl pH 7.7 1.5 M NaCl. We baked the filters in a vacuum oven for 2 h at 80 C and prehybridized them in 200 ml of 6xSSPE 0.9 M NaCl, 90 mM sodium phosphate, 6 mM sodium EDTA, pH 7.0 , 0.5 SDS, 100 µg ml tRNA and 5x Denhardt s solution at 55 C with shaking for several hours. We then hybridized the filters overnight at 55 C in 200 ml of the prehybridization mixture containing 10 pmoles of ³²P labeled oligonucleotide. We washed the filters with 6xSSPE and detected hybridization by autoradiography see T. Maniatis, et al., We isolated a number of positive clones by this procedure. One of these clones, designated Lipo 8, was grown up and its plasmid DNA, designated pLipo8, was extracted and sequenced according to the technique of Maxam and Gilbert, We also extracted the expressed protein from Lipo 8 and treated this preparation with 3 mg ml of cyanogen bromide in 70 formic acid to produce lipocortin like polypeptide fragments. We tested this crude fragment mixture for phospholipase A₂ inhibitory activity using the Once we had demonstrated the ability to replace met 56 and 127 without affecting the biological activity of the resulting lipocortin polypeptide fragment, we could then replace other amino acid residues of the lipocortin protein with methionine or insert methionines into various sites within the amino acid sequence of the lipocortin protein. In this way, new cleavage fragments of lipocortin with biological activity were isolated. For example, using the procedure outlined above, we replaced the leucine at residue 109 of the amino acid sequence of lipocortin with a methionine. We hybridized mutagenic oligonucleotide Lipo 68 see Figure 20 to a heteroduplex formed from restriction of plasmids pKK233 2 and pLipo8 which is identical to the pLiptrc155A of Figure 6 except for the nucleotide changes of Lipo 60 and 61 . We thus obtained a transformant, Lipo 11, that contains the desired nucleotide changes to replace Leu 109 with a methionine. pLipoll DNA was extracted from this transformant and sequencing indicated the desired nucleotide changes had been achieved. Clone Lipo 11 was then grown up in culture and expressed protein extracted and treated with cyanogen bromide to produce fragments. We isolated a 14.6 Kd polypeptide fragment see Figure 21 by SDS polyacylamide gel filtration of the treated protein extract See Biorad Catalog Price List K, p. 37 1985 and assayed this fragment for biological activity using the Similarly, oligonucleotide Lipo 78 see Figure 20 was used to generate a transformant, Lipo 15, which contains the desired nucleotide changes to replace Leu 198 with a methionine. Cleavage of the extracted expressed protein with cyanogen bromide followed by SDS polyacrylamide gel filtration resulted in the purification of a 20.7 K polypeptide fragment see Figure 21 which was then assayed for biological activity. This assay indicated that the Lipo 15 fragment possesses phospholipase A₂ inhibitory activity. Alternatively, we inserted a methionine into the lipocortin amino acid sequence at residue 169 by inserting a synthetic oligonucleotide into a restriction site on the lipocortin DNA sequence, thereby creating a codon for methionine at that site. We restricted pLipo8 with Thus, we have isolated at least three biologically active lipocortin like polypeptide fragments by the use of recombinant DNA techniques the 26 Kd fragment of Lipo 8, the 14.6 Kd fragment of Lipo 11, and the 20.7 Kd fragment of Lipo 15. It is to be understood, however, that other lipocortin like polypeptide fragments can be produced by the above described procedure e.g., by replacement of other amino acids along the lipocortin amino acid sequence with methionine . Furthermore, lipocortin like fragments can be produced by altering the DNA sequence encoding lipocortin to introduce or insert amino acids other than methionine to yield an altered polypeptide. This polypeptide can then be cleaved by an appropriate enzyme or chemical to yield biologically active fragments e.g., cysteines can be inserted and the protein cleaved with NTCB, 2 nitro 5 thiocyanobenzoic acid . We have also obtained a nucleotide sequence encoding a portion of N lipocortin, a human lipocortin like polypeptide displaying phospholipase A₂ inhibitory activity and having amino acid homology to the 37 Kd lipocortin produced according to this invention. A fresh placenta was packaged on ice immediately after birth and processed within 6 h as follows We skinned the placenta, cut it into cubes and washed the tissue with ten 300 ml changes of ice cold PBS 50 mM Na₂HPO₄, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl and 5 sucrose until the tissue was pink and no additional hemoglobin was released by the washes. The washed placenta weighed about 350 g. We washed 30 g of the placenta tissue with 150 ml of extraction buffer 25 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.7, 5 mM EDTA, 0.l mg ml aprotinin, 0.l mg ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 40 uM pepstatin A and then suspended the tissue in 100 ml of the same buffer. We disrupted the preparation with a polytron for 5 7 min on ice and subjected the homogenate to centrifugation at 4 C for 15 min at 10,000 rpm in an SS34 rotor. We decanted the supernatants, disrupted the pellets with a polytron in an additional 100 ml of extraction buffer and subjected the suspension again to centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatants of both extractions were combined and processed. First, we subjected the extract to DEAE cellulose chromatography on an 80 ml column DE52, Whatman Ltd., column dimensions 2.5 cm dia x 16 cm that had been equilibrated with 25 mM Tris HCl pH 7.7 . We concentrated the flow through preparations by ultrafiltration with an Amicon PM10 membrane to 15 ml. We then subjected the concentrated preparation to centrifugation for 15 min at 18,000 xg in an SS34 rotor. The apparent ionic strength of the concentrate was approximated by measuring the conductivity of the flow through from the ultrafiltration. Based on this value, we diluted the concentrate with water to an apparent ionic strength equal to that of 25 mM Tris HCl pH 7.7 10 ml of water was added . We next subjected this preparation to a second DEAE cellulose step on a 40 ml column and further fractionated the DEAE flow through by gel filtration chromatography on a 200 ml P150 column column dimensions 2.5 cm dia x 40 cm , which also was performed in 25 mM Tris HCl pH 7.7 . We collected 5 ml fractions of this eluate and assayed an aliquot for phospholipase inhibitory activity using the We next subjected the eluate from the gel filtration column to reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography HPLC on a C4 column Vydac , using a gradient of acetonitrile from 0 75 in 0.l trifluoroacetic acid to elute the bound fragments. We found that the eluate actually contained two 35 Kd components a natural human lipocortin component that eluted from the column with 65.8 acetonitrile and an N lipocortin component that eluted with 65.l acetonitrile. Only the natural lipocortin component was immunoreactive with the antibody raised against recombinant lipocortin. In order to further purify the two components in a manner in which we retained phospholipase A₂ inhibitory activity, we subjected the partially purified preparation from the gel filtration column to fast protein liquid chromatography FPLC, Pharmacia on a Mono S high resolution cation exchange chromatography resin HR5 5, Pharmacia . At pH 6.0 in 50 mM MES buffer 2 morpholino ethanesulfonic acid , both components bound to the Mono S column and were eluted with a gradient of NaCl. Figure 23 shows the elution profile of the proteins absorbance monitored at 280 nm panel A and the profile of phospholipase A₂ inhibitory activity panel B from the Mono S column. In panel A, peak I corresponds to lipocortin and peak II to N lipocortin. Only the material in peak I was immunoreactive with the rabbit antiserum against recombinant lipocortin. Panel B clearly indicates that both lipocortin and N lipocortin show phospholipase A₂ inhibitory activity. Based on their relative amounts in the purified preparations, we estimate that the specific activities of the two proteins as phospholipase inhibitors are roughly identical. We have also analyzed these two proteins by tryptic mapping. A larger portion of a placenta was processed and the proteins purified using the protocol as detailed above. The sizes and volumes of solutions and columns were adjusted appropriately. After the two 35 Kd proteins were separated by reverse phase HPLC, 100 µg of each of the purified proteins was subjected to tryptic mapping analysis as follows We dried the appropriate HPLC fractions under vacuum in a Speed Vac Concentrator Savant , resuspended the resulting pellets in 400 µl of 0.1 M ammmonium bicarbonate pH 8.0, 0.l mM CaCl₂ , and digested the mixture with trypsin. TPCK trypsin Worthington, 5 µg total was added to 100 µg of protein and the digestion performed for 16 h at 37 C. The trypsin was added in three equal aliquots the first at time zero, the second after 4 h, and the third after 12 h of incubation. The digest was acidified with formic acid to 20 v v . We then resolved the cleavage fragments from the trypsin digestion by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography at 40 C on a C18 column as described earlier in Example A. The column eluate was monitored at 214 nm. The tryptic maps for lipocortin panel A and N lipocortin panel B are shown in Figure 24. The tryptic map of the natural human lipocortin isolated from placenta is identical to the tryptic map obtained from the 37 Kd lipocortin derived from the expression of human macrophage cDNA. DNA sequence analysis revealed two amino acid differences between the placenta and macrophage derived lipocortins. The map for N lipocortin shows that protein to be unique. We concentrated the eluate fractions corresponding to eleven of the peaks from the tryptic map of N lipocortin on a Speed Vac Concentrator and subjected them to amino terminal protein sequence analysis using a gas phase sequencer Applied Biosystems 470A . PTH amino acids from each cycle of the Edman degradation were analyzed by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography using the Applied Biosystems 120A PTH analyzer. The sequences derived from these analyses are shown in Figure 25. The T numbers to the left of the sequences in Figure 25 correspond to the peak numbers which are shown on the column profile at the top of the figure. Most of the peptide sequences of N lipocortin are unique, although some show sequence homology to human lipocortin purified in accordance with this invention, suggesting that the two 35 Kd components lipocortin and N lipocortin, respectively may be derived from the same family of proteins. As shown in Figure 25, to date, we have determined the primary structure of approximately one third of the N lipocortin molecule. Since the sequences of those fragments derived from HPLC peaks containing multiple fragments can be determined using techniques known in the art, we have actually provided the data necessary to determine the primary structure of approximately 50 of the molecule. Having determined the amino acid sequences of various regions of N lipocortin from human placenta see Figure 25 , we chemically synthesized four pools of anti sense oligonucleotide DNA probes that coded for some of those protein sequences. We used the same strategy and procedure as detailed earlier in Example B for recombinant lipocortin. The amino acid sequences of the four selected regions of N lipocortin and all the possible nucleotide codon combinations that encode them are shown in Figure 26. Coding degeneracies are indicated as follows N C, T, A or G R A or G Y C or T H A, C or T, P G or C X A, G or T and Z A or T. As shown in Figure 26, the four pools of DNA probes correspond to the amino acid sequences of tryptic fragments T20, T25, T24 and T9, respectively. To reduce further the degeneracies in the probes, we prepared each pool in subpools. Oligonucleotides NLipl to NLip3, corresponding to the amino acid sequence of fragment T20, are 24 mers with 128 fold degeneracy. Oligonucleotides NLip4 to NLip7 are 18 mers with 32 fold degeneracy and are homologous to the amino acid sequence of fragment T25. Oligonucleotides NLip8 to NLipll are 20 mers with 72 fold degeneracy, corresponding to the amino acid sequence of fragment T24, and NLip12 to NLip15 are 17 mers with 128 fold degeneracy, derived from the amino acid sequence of fragment T9. To test if our synthetic probes actually recognized human sequences, we hybridized the 3 sub pools, NLipl, NLip2, and NLip3, which were end labeled with ³²P using γ ³²P ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase, to GeneScreen filters containing poly A mRNA from human placenta, utilizing the Northern blotting technique H. Lehrach et al., We constructed a human cDNA library from poly A mRNA isolated from human placenta using essentially the same procedure as described earlier in Example C for construction of the human macrophage cDNA library. In this embodiment, however, we extracted total RNA from the human placenta of a female fetus by the guanidine isothiocyanate method essentially as described by J. M. Chirgwin et al. We screened the human placenta cDNA library with the labeled oligonucleotide probe, NLipl, using nitrocellulose filters as described below. An overnight culture of C600 hfl cells in L broth and 0.2 maltose was pelleted and resuspended in an equal amount of SM buffer. We pre adsorbed 0.9 ml of cells with 2 x 10⁶ phage particles at room temperature for 15 min. We diluted the suspension to 50 ml in LB plus 10 mM MgSO₄ and 0.7 agarose at 55 C and plated it on LB plates plus 10 mM MgSO₄. We screened 30 such plates. We incubated the plates at 37 C for approximately 5 h and then chilled the plates at 4 C for l h to allow the agarose to harden. We then transferred the λ phage particles from the plaque library plates to S S nitrocellulose filters by placing the filters onto the plates containing the recombinant plaques for 5 min. We then lifted the filters from the plates, lysed the phages on the filters by placing the filters onto a pool of 0.5 N NaOH 1.5 M NaCl for 5 min and neutralized and submerged the filters in l M Tris HCl 1.5 M NaCl pH 7.0 . The filters were then air dried and baked at 80 C for 2 h. We prehybridized and hybridized the treated filters to the oligonucleotide probe, NLipl, in 0.2 polyvinylpyrrolidone M.W. 40,000 , 0.2 ficoll M.W. 400,000 , 0.2 bovine serum albumin, 0.05 M Tris HCl pH 7.5 , lM sodium chloride, 0.l sodium pyrophosphate, l SDS, 10 dextran sulfate M.W. 500,000 and denatured salmon sperm DNA 100 µg ml according to manufacturer s specifications New England Nuclear for Colony Plaque Screen membranes. We detected hybridizing cDNA sequences by autoradiography. By means of this technique, we picked six positive plaques and rescreened at lower density using the same probe. We isolated the DNA of these clones, digested the DNA with We next restricted the DNA of these phages with Although clone λ Nlipo21 2 contains the N lipocortin DNA sequence encoding only a small region of the protein, the structural homology between lipocortin and N lipocortin is borne out by this region. As shown in Table 4 below, 11 of the last 17 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus of the two proteins are identical. Of the five differences, most are conservative amino acid substitutions. Based on the similarity in the phospholipase A₂ inhibitory activity of the two proteins and the similarity in the protein and DNA sequences of the proteins, we conclude that N lipocortin and lipocortin represent a family of related proteins. A comparison of the nucleotide sequences of the lipocortin and N lipocortin of this invention shows approximately 60 homology see Figure 28 . Microorganisms and recombinant DNA sequences prepared by the processes described herein are exemplified by a culture deposited in the culture collection of In Vitro International, Inc., Ann Arbor, Michigan. The culture was deposited on January 8, 1986 and is identified as follows The level of production of a protein is governed by three major factors the number of copies of its gene within the cell, the efficiency with which those gene copies are transcribed and the efficiency with which they are translated. Efficiency of transcription and translation which together comprise expression is in turn dependent upon nucleotide sequences normally situated ahead of the desired coding sequence. These nucleotide sequences or expression control sequences define, Several expression control sequences may be employed as described above. These include the operator, promoter and ribosome binding and interaction sequences including sequences such as the Shine Dalgarno sequences of the lactose operon of Therefore, to improve the production of the lipocortin like polypeptides of this invention, the DNA sequences for those polypeptides may be prepared as before and inserted into a recombinant DNA molecule closer to its former expression control sequence or under the control of one of the above improved expression control sequences. Such methods are known in the art. Other methods useful to improve the efficiency of translation involve the insertion of chemically or enzymatically prepared oligonucleotides in front of the initiating codon of the lipocortin related DNA sequences of this invention or the replacement of codons at the N terminal end of the DNA sequence with those chemically or enzymatically prepared oligonucleotides. By this procedure, a more optimal primary and higher order structure of the messenger RNA can be obtained. More specifically, a sequence can be so designed that the initiating AUG codon occurs in a readily accessible position i.e., not masked by secondary structure either at the top of a hairpin or in other single stranded regions. The position and sequence of the aforementioned Shine Dalgarno segment can similarly be optimized. The importance of the general structure folding of the messenger RNA has been documented D. Iserentant and W. Fiers, Secondary Structure Of mRNA And Efficiency Of Translation Initiation , Further increases in the cellular yield of the lipocortin like polypeptides of this invention may be achieved by increasing the number of genes that can be utilized in the cell. This may be achieved by insertion of the lipocortin gene with or without its transcription and translation control elements into a higher copy number plasmid or into a temperature controlled copy number plasmid i.e., a plasmid which carries a mutation such that the copy number of the plasmid increases after shifting the temperature B. Uhlin et al., Plasmids With Temperature Dependent Copy Number For Amplification Of Cloned Genes And Their Products , Alternatively, an increase in gene dosage can be achieved, for example, by insertion of recombinant DNA molecules, engineered in the manner described above, into the temperate bacteriophage λ, most simply by digestion of the plasmid with a restriction enzyme, to give a linear molecule which is then mixed with a restricted phage λ cloning vehicle e.g., of the type described by N. E. Murray et al., Lambdoid Phages That Simplify The Recovery Of In Vitro Recombinants , Therefore, it should be understood that the lipocortin like polypeptide coding sequences of this invention may be removed from the disclosed vectors and inserted into other expression vectors, as previously described While we have hereinbefore presented a number of embodiments of this invention, it is apparent that our basic construction can be altered to provide other embodiments which utilize the processes and compositions of this invention. Therefore, it will be appreciated that the scope of this invention is to be defined by the claims appended hereto rather than by the specific embodiments which have been presented hereinbefore by way of example.
