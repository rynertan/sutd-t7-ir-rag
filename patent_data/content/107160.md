# LIQUID CRYSTAL DISPLAY DEVICE

## Abstract
A liquid crystal display device has a tandem arrange ment of two cells. The rear cell is an active silicon matrix backed dyed nematic cell with 180 twist cell affording the possibility of grey scale representations. The front cell is a dyed nematic cell oriented to act as a variable density polariser to absorb the weakly absorbed plane of the rear cell. Control of this absorption is used to optimise the con trast perception in the rear cell under different ambient lighting conditions.
