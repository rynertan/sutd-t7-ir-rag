## Description
This invention relates generally to the field ofradiographic systems. Radiography is a long known medical diagnosticimaging technique. In a conventional radiography system, an x raysource is actuated to direct a divergent area beamof x rays through a patient. A cassette containingan x ray sensitive phosphor screen and light and x raysensitive film is positioned in the x ray beamon the side of the patient opposite the source. X radiationpassing through the patient s body isthereby attenuated in various degrees to produceon the film a shadow image of a portion of thepatient through which the x rays pass. More recently, digital radiographic techniquesand systems have been developed. In digital radiographythe source directs x radiation through apatient s body to a detector assembly located inthe beam path beyond the patient. The detectorproduces electrical signals defining the radiationpattern emergent from the patient and incident onthe assembly. These signals are then processed toyield a visual display of the image. The detector assembly includes an elongatedplanar array of individual detector elements. A detectorelement can suitably comprise a scintillatorhaving a receiving face positioned in front of aphotodiode. Each detector element responds toincident x radiation to produce an analog electricalcharge signal indicative of such radiation. Theseanalog electrical signals represent the radiation patternemergent from the patient s body. The analog signals are sampled and processedby imaging circuitry, primarily to improve their signalto noise ratio, and are subsequently digitized. The digital signals are fed to a digital dataprocessing unit. The data processing unit recordsand or processes and enhances the digital data. A display unit responds to appropriate digitaldata representing the image to convert the digitalinformation back into analog form and to produce avisual display of the patient s internal body structurederived from the acquired image pattern ofradiation. The display unit can be coupled directlyto the digital data processing unit for substantiallyreal time imaging, or can be fed stored digital datafrom digital storage means such as tapes or disks,representing patient images produced from earlierstudies. Digital radiography includes techniques inwhich a thin spread beam of x radiation is used. Inpractice of this technique, often called scan orslit projection radiography SPR , the spreadbeam is scanned across the patient, or the patientis movably interposed between the spread beam x raysource and the detector assembly, the detectorbeing maintained in continuous alignment with thebeam. The relative movement effected between thesource detector arrangement and the patient sbody scans a large portion of the body. Discrete element detectors have been proposedcomprising a single line of detector elements.Other proposals have included planar rectangulardetector arrays of square detector elements. Details of certain aspects of digital radiographysystems such as described here are set forth in thefollowing publications It has also been proposed, where the detectorarray comprises a planar rectangular array ofsquare detector elements, to improve the signal tonoise ratio of the information developed by thedetector, by the use of time delay and integrate TDI circuitry. An embodiment of such a proposedsystem is described in United States Letters PatentNo. 4,383,327, issued on May 10, 1983 to Kruger.Such proposed TDI systems employ sampling atregular intervals of detector motion, and motion synchronousshifting and adding of the individualdetector produced analog charge signals which aresampled. An important technique for enhancing a digitallyrepresented image is called subtraction . Thereare two types of subtraction techniques, one being temporal subtraction, the other being energy subtraction. Temporal, sometimes called mask mode subtraction, is a technique that can be used toremove overlying and underlying structures froman image when the object of interest is enhancedby a radiopaque contrast agent. Images are acquiredwith and without the contrast agent present and the data representing the former image issubtracted from the data representing the latter,substantially cancelling out all but the blood vesselsor anatomical regions containing the contrastagent. A principal limitation of digital temporal subtractionis the susceptibility to misregistration, or motion artifacts caused by patient movement betweenthe acquisition of the images with and withoutthe contrast agent. An alternative to temporal subtraction, which isless susceptible to motion artifacts, is energy subtraction.Whereas temporal subtraction depends on changes in the contrast distribution with time, energysubtraction exploits energy related differencesin attenuation properties of various types of tissues,such as the difference of the attenuation characteristicsof soft tissue and bone. Soft tissue shows less change in attenuationcapability with respect to energy than does bone. This phenomenon enables performance of energysubtraction. In practising that technique,pulses of x rays having alternating higher and lowerenergy levels are directed through the patient sbody. When a lower energy pulse is so generated,the detector and associated digital processing unitcooperate to acquire and store a set of digital datarepresenting the image produced in response tothe lower energy pulse. A very short time later,when the higher energy pulse is produced, thedetector and digital processing unit again similarlycooperate to acquire and store a separate set ofdigital information representing the image producedby the higher energy pulse. The values obtainedrepresenting the lower and higher energy imagesare then processed in accordance with techniquesdescribed in the following publication Lehmann,L.A. et al, Generalized Image Combination in DualKVP Digital Radiography Energy subtraction has the advantage, relativeto temporal subtraction, of being substantially notsubject to motion artifacts resulting from the patient smovement between exposures. The timeseparating the lower and higher imaging acquisitionsis quite short, often less than one sixtieth of asecond. An important disadvantage in dual energy subtractiontechniques results from the necessity ofrapidly alternating the output of an x ray tube betweenhigh and low levels. This requirement givesrise to severe problems in a practical clinical device.The switching frequency is required to be onthe order of 500 Hz. and insufficient photons x rayenergy result when even the highest capacity x raytubes are combined with realistically narrow x raybeam slit widths and rapid scanning rates. In order to eliminate this problem a detectorassembly has been proposed which enables thepractice of energy subtraction radiography with theuse of a constant output x ray source. In accordance with this proposal, a dual layerplanar dual energy radiation detector assembly hasbeen suggested in the application EP A 0 115 125cited above. A first layer comprises a rectangularplanar array of square detector photodiode elementsincluding a first radiation sensitive scintillationmaterial overlying the photodiodes and beingselected for its primary response to radiation of alower energy range. A second planar layer is located,or stacked , directly behind the first layer,with respect to the x ray tube, and comprises asimilar rectangular array of detector elements congruentand aligned with the first layer. The secondlayer includes a second radiation sensitive scintillationmaterial selected for its propensity to respondprimarily to radiation of a higher energy level,which has passed through the first layer substantiallywithout being detected. Such a dual energy detector structure, whenused in conjunction with an x ray tube emittingenergy over a wide range, will provide data describingtwo separate images, i.e. one an image oflower energy x radiatibn passing through the subject,the other being an image describing the patternof higher energy radiation. A flat rectangular detector of any type, however,has the inherent disadvantage that radiationintensity falling upon the various detector elementsis a function of the element s relative position in thearray, in addition to being a function of the patient sbody structure. This results from the fact that x rayenergy travelling from the x ray tube focal spottoward a detector element near the image peripherymust travel a longer path than x ray energydirected toward the central portion of the detector.This disadvantage is a problem in both single anddual energy flat detector systems. With a flat detector, x rays incident on centrallylocated detector elements enter the scintillatornearly normal to the receiving face. Rays incidenton peripherally located elements enter the scintillatorsat angles which vary considerably from thenormal. Under such conditions, a ray entering aperipheral element travels a longer path within itsrespective scintillator than does a ray entering centralelements. Due to the longer paths travelled, aray entering a peripheral element produces a greaterscintillation than does a ray of equal valueentering a central element, causing a response bythe peripheral element that falsely exaggerates theindicated energy of the ray entering the peripheralelement. This problem acquires yet another aspect where a dual energy detector is used having twosets of stacked detector element arrays. A greaterproportion of a ray s energy is dissipated inpassage through a peripheral element than in passagethrough a central element. Therefore, a smallerfraction of energy incident on a peripheral frontlayer detector element is left to actuate a rearperipheral detector element than would be left toactuate a rear central detector after passagethrough a front central element. This phenomenondistorts the relative responses of the dual energydetector arrays, or layers, in a way which is verydifficult to correct. Where a flat dual energy detector, as describedabove, is used, there is an additional disadvantage.Due to parallax, image features viewedby the second detector layer, behind the first detectorlayer, will be seen as slightly spatially displacedwith respect to the same image features asseen by the first detector layer. Therefore, theimage produced by the second detector layer willdiffer slightly from that of the first, which differencewill degrade the quality of the energy subtractionimage which is derived when the first image data issubtracted from or combined with the second. It is an object of this invention to provide aradiographic systemcapable of producing shadow images but not computerisedtomography images and having a dual energy detector wherein theimaging response is uniform over the detector,and which does not suffer disadvantages ofparallax. According to the present invention there isprovided a radiographic systemcapable of producing shadow images but not computerisedtomography images comprising means arranged to pass a divergentbeam of radiation from a source through a volumetric portion ofa subject onto a radiation detector means to produce said shadowimage of said portion of the subject, said detector meansproducing electrical output signals representative of theradiation incident thereon and the system further includingimaging circuitry coupled to said detector means for utilisingsaid output signals to produce said shadow image, and saiddetector means comprising a first detector structure comprisinga material sensitive to radiation within a first energy range andhaving a first surface on which said radiation falls,and a second detector structure comprising a material sensitiveto radiation within a second energy range and havinga second surface on which said radiation falls and which overliessaid first surface, characterised in that said first and secondsurfaces are curved about said source so as to eliminatesubstantially for each one of said surfaces differences in thelengths of the paths between said source and different points onthat one of said surfaces. In one particular embodiment of the inventionsaid beam is a divergent thin planar beam and saidsurfaces each define a portion of the surface of a cylinderwhose axis is perpendicular to the plane ofsaid beam. In such a system said source normallywill have a focal spot from which said beam emanatesand each said axis passes substantially throughsaid focal spot. A system according to the invention suitablyincludes means for rotating said source relative tothe subject so as to scan radiation across thesubject, and means for simultaneously scanningsaid detector means along an arcuate path so as todetect the radiation from the source passingthrough the subject as the radiation scans acrossthe subject. In another particular embodiment of the inventioneach said surface defines a portion of a surface of asphere. In such a system said source normally willhave a focal spot from which said beam emanatesand each sphere has its centre substantially coincidentwith the focal spot. In US A 4284895, DE A 2831038 and DE A 3311931 there aredescribed radiation detector arrays which present acurved surface to radiation incident thereon from aradiation source so that the lengths of the pathsbetween the source and different points on thesurface are substantially the same. However, thesearrays are used in computerised tomography CT radiographic systems, not in radiographic systemsof the kind to whichthe present inventionrelates, i.e. which are specifically not capable of producingcomputerised tomography images. In DE A 2831038 use in a radiographic system of multi layereddetectors to determine the energy profile of incidentradiation for the purpose of effecting correction for radiationhardening in a subject is described, but these multi layereddetectors do not comprise a multi energy imaging detectorstructure. Several radiographic systemin accordance will now be described, byway of example, with reference to the accompanyingdrawings in which A system S for performing digital scan projectionradiography SPR is illustrated in general formin Figure 1. The system S directs a pattern of x raysthrough a patient P and produces, from informationborne by the x ray pattern emergent from,the patient s body, a representation, generally inthe form of a visible image, describing internalstructure or condition of the patient s body. The system S incorporates an x ray source 10for directing a beam of x ray energy illustrated as acollection of rays 12 through the patient P and ontoa detector assembly 14. A first collimator structure16 defines a generally vertical fore slit 18 for collimatingthe x rays emanating from the source intoa spread beam lying generally within a verticalplane. A second collimator structure 20 defines anaft slit 22 located between the patient and thedetector assembly, aligned with the fore slit andwith the detector, for enhancing this collimation. Mechanical structure not shown maintains amutually constant relative alignment between thecollimators 16, 20, the x ray source 10 and thedetector assembly 14. In the preferred embodiment, mechanicalmeans is provided for scanning the collimators anddetector in unison relative to the patient s body in amanner described in more detail below. The mechanical structure can suitably comprisea gantry structure of known configuration notshown which physically holds the collimators anddetector in a rigid alignment, and mechanical drivemeans to move the entire gantry to effect scanning.Alternately, the components can be coupled toindividual drive mechanisms, and servo techniquescan be employed in known fashion to maintain thedesired alignment during scanning motion. In the preferred embodiment, mechanical scannerapparatus 24 is coupled to the detector assembly14 to move the detector along a generallyarcuate path defined by the arrows 26, 28. Thearcuate path is centered about a vertical axis 34through a focal spot 32 of the tube 10, described inmore detail below. Pivoting apparatus 30 is coupled to the x raysource. The apparatus 30 pivots the source, synchronouslywith detector and collimator arcuatemotion, to continuously track the detector 14 andthe mutually aligned collimators 16, 20. The x ray source 10 comprises an x ray tube,and associated power circuitry not shown forelectrically actuating power circuitry not shown forelectrically actuating the tube to produce x rays inpulsed or continuous mode emanating from a focalspot 32 defined by the structure of the tube. Tube10 produces x rays by directing a stream of electronsonto an anode 33a of the tube, the anoderotating about an axis 33b. The pivoting motioneffected by the pivot apparatus 30 causes the tubeto pivot about the vertical axis 34 extendingthrough the focal point 32. The axis 33b of the rotatable anode 33a is, inthe Figure 1 embodiment, approximately parallel tothe vertical axis 34 through the focal spot, the axis34 being the axis of detector scanning as well,about which the arcuate detector path is centered. In some instances, it is desirable to tilt the axis33b slightly, with respect to the axis 34, by about 8degrees, or a similar small amount. This tilting optimizes the configuration of thepattern 12 of x rays which emanate from the tubeand propagate through the collimator slits 18, 22.More specifically, the tilt angle is chosen to maximisethe uniformity of x ray energy passingthrough all portions of the slits 18, 22. The tilting isdesirable for uniformity maximisation because thex ray energy produced by the tube 10 varies inherentlywith the angle 33c from the axis 33b at whichenergy emanates, and the degree of non uniformityvaries over the range of such angles. This is oftencalled the heel and toe effect of the tube. Thetilting angle is selected to enable the projection ofenergy through the slits 18, 22 from that range ofangles 33c over which the x rays are most uniform. It is believed preferable to couple the detectorassembly 14 to the master drive of the scannerapparatus and to control the tube and collimators tofollow, since detector positioning is more criticalthan tube positioning. An encoder 36 is coupled to the scanner apparatus24 and produces a signal indicating theinstantaneous position of the detector 14 along itsarcuate path described by the arrows 26, 28. Theoutput of the encoder 36 is directed to the pivotapparatus 30 for synchronising the pivoting motionof the x ray tube 10 with the arcuate motion of thedetector 14 and collimators 16, 20, to maintaincontinuous alignment between the x ray beam, collimatorsand detector assembly during scanningmotion. The scanner apparatus can be appropriatelygated by a physiological signal, such as by anECG signal 37, or by a signal indicating timing ofadministration of a contrast agent. Temporal subtractionstudies can also be done, with sufficientlyrapid retrace between scans. An example of a type of encoder apparatus isdescribed in US Patent No. 4,015,129, issued onMarch 29, 1977 to Manring et al, and owned by theassignee of the present application. The encoder 36 may also be coupled to acurrent control 33 of the x ray tube 10. The encodercan adjust the tube current and hence, theintensity of x ray output, as a function of the locationof the detector along its scanning path. In theembodiment described here, the tube current canbe controlled to decrease as a function of thedegree of detector displacement from the centreposition along its scanning path. Thus, where thepatient s body is less thick, i.e. near its right andleft sides, x ray output is reduced to maintain amore uniform x ray flux at the detector throughoutits scan. The detector assembly 14, a conventional detectorarray being shown in Figure 1, includes anarray of individual detector elements, generally arrangedwithin an elongated slot 28a defined by thedetector assembly 14. The structure and arrangementof the detector elements is described in detailbelow. Each of the detector elements responds tolight energy generated by x rays as describedbelow to produce an analog electrical charge signalwhich represents a characteristic of the x raywhich caused the production of the electrical signal. In operation, the detector, collimators and x raytube are moved to the left as in the directionilustrated by the arrow 26 to prepare for a scan. Inperforming a scan, the x ray tube 10 is actuated toproduce x ray energy. The scanner apparatus 24and pivot apparatus 30 cooperate to synchronouslyscan the vertical spread beam of x rays from left toright as shown in Figure 1 across the patient sbody. During this scanning motion, the detectorelements of the detector assembly 14 produce theanalogue electrical signals. Analogue detector outputs from each of thedetector elements are periodically sampled. Eachsampling produces analogue signals representing aportion of image information. Over the course ofthe scan from one side to the other side, signalsare developed describing a plurality of image lines,which together constitute an area image of thepatient s internal body structure. The electrical signals are then digitised andprocessed to produce the desired patient imaging. Figure 2 illustrates a generalised block diagramof the system of Figure 1. In Figure 2, the x raysource 10 directs x rays to the detector assembly14. The individual detector elements of the detectorassembly 14 are mutually coupled to and associatedwith time delay and integrate TDI circuitry43 which executes shift and add operations on thedetector outputs in synchronism with detectorscanning motion to produce image indicating analoguesignals with enhanced signal to noise ratio.Signals from the detector 14 and TDI circuitry 43are then transmitted to a data processor 44 whichdigitizes and processes the electrical signals. Inresponse to commands from an operator s console46, the data processor 44 produces various typesof representations of internal body structure of theexamined patient. In one mode, the data processoractuates a diagnostic viewing console 48 to producedirectly a visible image of the patient s internalbody structure which can be immediately employedby a radiologist for medical diagnostic purposes. In another mode, the data processor 44 storesdigital information representing patient image datain one or more peripheral memories 50. Optionally,a camera 52 can be coupled to the data processor. Figure 3 shows one embodiment of a focusseddetector in accordance with the invention. Figure 3illustrates an x ray tube 60 directing a spread beamof x rays 62 through a patient P toward the detectorarrangement 64. Fore and aft collimators 66, 68defining aligned collimator slits are also illustrated.The remainder of the system is similar to thatdescribed above and is omitted for simplicity andclarity. The detector includes a first front array 70 ofdetector elements and a second back array 72 ofdetector elements located behind the first arraywith respect to the x ray tube. Both the first andsecond arrays are aligned with the fore and aftslits. Radiation from the x ray tube falls upon, andis partially absorbed by, the first array, and theremainder of the radiation, passing through the firstarray, falls upon and is detected by the secondarray. In this way, separate dual energy responseis obtained, as explained in the Barnes publishedapplication cited above. Each of the arrays includes a single line ofdetector elements arranged along an arcuate pathdefined by a portion of a circle having its centrelocated at a focal spot 74 of the x ray tube. The detector arrays scan along arcuate pathsconcentric with the path indicated by the arrows69. The concentric paths are centered about avertical scanning axis 75 extending through thetube focal spot 74. The axis 77 is approximatelyperpendicular to the scanning axis 75. This geometry reduces the non uniformity ofthe x ray energy across the beam set 62 propagatingthrough the collimator 66, 68 by eliminating theeffect of the heel and toe effect characteristic ofthe x ray tube. According to the heel and toeeffect, the x ray energy from a tube varies as afunction of the angle of x ray emission with respectto the axis of anode rotation. Such radiation is farless a function of the angle of the x ray propagationtaken radially with respect to the anode rotativeaxis. In the Figure 3 embodiment, the axis 77 is alsotilted slightly from the perpendicular to the approximate plane defined by the aligned collimators 66,68 and detector array layers 70, 72. The amount oftilting is about 8 degrees from the perpendicular tothe plane so defined. The tilting is desirable forreasons analogous to thos explained with respectto the tilting in Figure 1. Each detector element comprises aphotodiode. Overlying each photodiode is a scintillationmaterial responsive to x rays to producevisible light energy. The scintillation material used in connectionwith the first array differs from that used in connectionwith the second array. The scintillation materialassociated with the first array is selected for itsability to absorb and produce light in response tox rays from the source falling primarily within arelatively low energy range. The higher energy x rayspass through the first array and fall on thesecond array, causing the scintillation material associatedwith the second array to produce lightwhich is detected by the individual detectorphotodiodes of the second array. Suitable types,thicknesses and physical configurations of the scintillationmaterial are defined in the above citedBarnes published European patent application. The preferred detector embodiments of thisinvention described can suitably include a radiationfilter, made of copper or brass sheet or othersimilar material, located at the region indicated byreference character 73, to harden the radiationenergy reaching the second detector layer or array.Such filter elements are used to improve energydiscrimination between the two detector layers inways as are described in the above cited Barnespublished European patent application. The scintillation or phosphor material used inconjunction with the individual photodiode arraysdiscussed herein can suitably comprise a uniformsingle portion or layer of phosphor material overlyingthe entirety of the photodiode array withoutbreaks or interruptions in its surface. Thus, theconfiguration of this embodiment forms a uniformsmooth curved surface which comprises the energyreceiving face of the detector array. In another embodiment, each detector elementphotodiode can be provided with its own individualportion of scintillation phosphor material, ratherthan the entire array being covered with a singlepiece of such material. In this latter embodiment,the individual receiving faces of each of the detectorelements, with their scintillators, collectivelyform a curved surface which is approximatelysmooth. Known electronic and or software correctionmeans can be used to compensate, if need be, forany non uniformity of transmission characteristicsthrough the front detector array. This correctionmeans can be associated with data processor 44. Figure 4 illustrates another embodiment of theinvention in the form of an alternate detector arrayconfiguration. In Figure 4. energy from an x raytube 80 is directed through a collimator not shown and in an area beam 82 through the patient.emerging therefrom to all in a relatively large areaof a detector assembly 84. In the embodiment ofFigure 4, a first detector array 86 includes a relativelylarge number of individual detector elementsarranged in an area pattern, with the receivingsurface of the first detector array collectively defininga portion of a sphere having its centre at afocal spot 87 of the x ray tube. The detector elementarrangement not shown is as described inthe above cited Kurger patent. A second similar detector array 88 is locatedbehind the first array with respect to the x ray tube.The second array has a receiving surface definedby a portion of a sphere having a radius slightlylarger than the sphere referred to in connectionwith the first array, and whose centre is also locatedat the x ray tube focal spot. The source detector arrangement shown in Figure4 incorporating the area beam can, but neednot, be scanned. That is, the area beam can bedirected constantly or in pulsed mode to passsimultaneously through a predetermined relativelylarge area of the patient s body, or the beam anddetector can be scanned in unison,analogous to themanner of scanning described in connection withFigure 1. An alternative embodiment employs the sphericallyor cylindrically configured, detector arrays ofFigure 4 and in Figures 5 7 described below inconjunction with the thin spread beam and collimatorarrangement as illustrated in Figure 3. In thisalternate embodiment, the spread beam is scannedacross the area detector, the detector remainingstationary relative to the patient. Techniques for processing image data fromnon scanned detector arrays, or single linescanned arrays in digital radiography are wellknown. Data processing of scanned multi linear arraysis discussed below. Other embodiments of focussed detector configurationsin accordance with the invention areillustrated in Figures 5 and 6. Figure 5 shows aportion of each of two stacked detector arrays 92,94. The detector of Figure 5 comprises a multiplicityof detector elements 96 whose receiving surfacescollectively define approximately a portion ofa cylinder having a horizontal axis intersecting thefocal spot of the x ray tube. Either a single layer, ora dual layer, or stacked detector, as shown, canbe used. Figure 6 illustrates another embodiment.wherein the detector element receiving faces 95define collectively a portion of a cylinder having a vertical axis through the x ray tube focal spot. Adual layer 97,99 arrangement is shown, but asingle layer can be used if desired. It is important to note that in the detectorarrangement of Figures 4 7, Figure 7 to be discussedbelow known time delay and integration TDI circuitry can be employed, where the beamand detector are synchronously scanned, to enhancethe signal to noise ratio of information derivedfrom the scanned detector. In the embodimentof Figure 4, for example, a rectangular arrayof detector elements can be used. When such anarray is used, the techniques for employing TDIoutput signal enhancement are described in theabove cited Kruger patent. The embodiments ofFigures 5 7 can also incorporate rectangular arraysof elements and TDI. A further aspect of this invention is illustrated inFigures 5 7. Figure 7, for example, depicts a portionof a double layer 101, 103 spherical threedimensionally curved detector assembly 104, similarto that of Figure 4, but wherein individual detectorelements are arranged in a staggered fashion.Figures 5 and 6 illustrate embodiments wherein thedetector elements are arranged in staggered patternsand collectively define a portion of a cylinder. In the embodiments of Figures 5 7, incorporatingstaggered arrays of detector elements, timedelay and integrate TDI signal enhancement techniquescan also be employed. Each column extending substantially verticallyin Figures 5 7 is offset vertically from its adjacentcolumns by a distance equal to one half the centre tocentre spacing between adjacent elements alonga column. It should be understood that, while the preferredembodiments described herein are intendedto include a dual layered stacked detector, theinvention also encompasses embodiments similarto those of the Figures, but employingmore than two stacked detector layersused analogously to those described here. Also, it should be understood that each of theembodiments of Figures 4 7 preferably include abeam hardening filter analogous to the filter 73shown in Figure 3, and the x ray tube geometrydescribed in connection with Figures 1 and 3. The relationships among the signals appearingin the various TDI sampling periods and among thevarious detector elements, in implementing the TDItechnique in conjunction with the staggered array.are represented by the following relation The totalaccumulated charge corresponding to the j th pixelof the i th row, i.e., P i j , of the total derivedimage is given by the following expression See Figure 8 for a graphical representation ofthe notation of the above equation. It is to be understood that the foregoing descriptionof the present invention is intended asillustrative, rather than exhaustive, of the invention.
