# Braking actuator.

## Abstract
The invention pertains to vehicle brake actuators of the expansible motor type wherein the actuator includes a cylinder having a piston and piston rod assembly reciprocal therein, a helical spring biases the piston in a braking direction, and a pressurized medium, such as hydraulic fluid, forces the piston in a spring compressing direction. The unique features include a piston drawn from sheet metal wherein the piston rod is pressed thereinto, and the piston seals are retained in position by a wire ring having an interference fit with the piston. Additionally, novelty resides in the use of a retainer formed of wire or of stamped construction having protruberances defined thereon for retaining the cylinder end cap upon the cylinder in a manner to permit ease and safety of assembly, and uniform force distribution.
