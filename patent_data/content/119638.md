# Coriolis type mass flow meter comprising at least two straight parallel vibrating tubes.

## Abstract
Coriolis type mass flow meter to be used in a flow line, said meter comprising a flow means 1 for having a fluid flow therethrough, said flow means 1 being adapted to be vibrated by an exciting means at 50 of the length of the flow means 1 in a direction normal to the flow direction A , and means adapted to detect the phase difference oc curing between upstream and downstream parts of the flow means 1 at equal distances from the exciting means, when subjected to vibration at a certain frequency, and means adapted to connect the flow means 1 to the flowline, where in said flow means 1 comprises at least two straight parallel tubes 2 .
