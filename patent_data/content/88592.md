# Chemically modified electrodes and their uses.

## Abstract
There is disclosed an electrically conducting solid electrode on the surface of which a nitrogen containing electron mediator, such as a viologen, and a strongly acidic cation exchange resin containing aromatic groups, such as polystyrenesulphonic acid, are immobilized. The electrodes can be used as hydrogen electrodes when a redox system is coupled to the electron mediator , as oxygen electrodes when a redox system such as a chloroplast is immobilized on the electrode , as voltametric detectors of biologically active substances, and as photochromic display elements.
