## Description
Method and Device for Digital Encoding and Decoding of Composite PAL Video Signal The present invention relates to video signal transmission systems and more particularly it concerns a method of and a device for the digital encoding and decoding of composite PAL video signal. As known1 in order to obtain an efficient transmission of the video signal it is necessary to effect a reduction in the data flow deriving from a simple sampling operation and from the quantization of the analog signal. The techniques utilized so far make use of predictive algorithms DPCM , bidimensional transform algorithms or mixed algorithms DPCM transforms . The predictive algorithms quantize the difference between the arriving signals and their predictions, obtained by means of suitable algorithms from the already quantized signal the transform methods are hased on the quantization of the coefficients obtained by applying suitable orthogonal operators finally mixed methods encode in DPCM line by line the homologous coefficients obtained by applying transform mation on adjiecent lines, effecting the transformation on the entire line or an the various blocks into which it may be uniformly subdivided. Predictive algorithms although they are casy to iniplement, do not allow sufficient reduction in the data flow the transformation algorithms are very efficient, but difficult to implement as they require extensive amount of computations. Mixed algorithms realize a good efficiency versus complexity compromise solution and have been applied for nionochrome video signal transmission as well as for colour system NTSC. In these application the prediction is obtained usually among homologous coefficients of blocks that occupy the same position in lines that follow one another in time and space. For the coding based on the same method as above of the composite PAL signal1 no problems are encountered for the encoding of coefficients carrying the only luminance signal analogously to what happens for monochrome signal on the contrary in the processing of colour information new complexity factors are introduced dependent on the distance chosen between the two lines used to perform the prediction. It is clear in fact that the best correlation for the prediction is achieved by using lines spacially as near as possible. Owing to the just mentioned complexity, the minimum distance at which the prediction of the coefficients carrying colour information in PAL system can be achieved by the known methods is equal to a space interval of 4 lines as in this case there is at least a sign inversion of the coefficients. But at a distance of 4 lines there is a high loss of correlation that entails a considerable reduction in the coding efficiency. At a two line distance the problem is solved by applying the transformation described in the present invention of a digital encoding system of composite PAL video signal that is a good compromise between the apposite requirements of construction simplicity and efficiency. It is a particular object of the present invention a method of digital encoding and decoding of the composite PAL video signal, in which, in transmission, the information of line START and field START is first extracted from the video portion of the analog video signal and then the analog signal is sampled at a frequency fs, dependant on the frequency fsc of the colour subcarrier by means of the relationship 12 fs 5 fsc 25 Hz 12 burst samples chosen beginning from a predeteriiiined sample are then extracted from the burst signal, present on each line, this too being sampled at frequency fs then the samples of image signal relevant to each line of the field are grouped into blocks of 12 image samples on said 12 burst samples and on said blocks of 12 image samples a discrete Fourier transform is then performed in order to produce subsequent series of twelve coefficients, a number of these series being relevant to the burst others being relevant to the image signal, only the tenth and the eleventh coefficients being utilized out of each series of twelve bust coefficients said tenth and eleventh coefficients being the components of a rotating vector representative of the burst and being multiplied by a normalization factor so that the. angular functions of angle e defining the phase of that rotating vector can be obtained, of each series of twelve coefficients of the image signal image coefficients , the first three coefficients undergoing a usual coding of DPCM type that takes into account the correlation existing amog image coefficients belonging to blocks occupyng the same position in lines following one another in time homologous coefficients , the inlage coefficients from the fourth to the ninth and the twelfth undergoing a PCM coding, the tenth and eleventh image coefficients, in which there is basically concentrated the information of the colour subcarrier, undergoing a specific coding of DPCM type, obtained by utilizing as a prediction signal, necessary to the coding, a linear combination according to two numbers ck and 13 of the values of the tenth and eleventh decoded image coefficients relevant to the block occupyng the same position in the line preceding in time, said encodings supplying corresponding encoded coefficients, said linear combination basically consisting in performing the product between matrix 2 x 1 consisting of said tenth and eleventh decoded image coefficients and the matrix 2 x 2EMI3.1 said num bers and 13 being respectively equal to cos 2 so and sin 2 when between the line used for the prediction and the one subsequent in time, there is a phase delay of the burst r and to cos 9 0 and sin 29w, in the case of phase lead, the information relevant to the value of said phase angles, that relevant to the beginning of each field and that rel evant to the beginning of each line, making part of the transmitted sig nal and in which in reception said information on the value of angle 9 is extracted, from said information the burst samples are reconstructed and said numbers alpha and ss are obtained, then by comparing two subse quent values of the angle e beginning from the one immediately follow ing the arrival of the signal of field START, the information is obtained that defines the phase relationship lead delay of the burst necessary to determine the sign of numbers 01 and 3, the 12 received image coef ficients are aftervards duly decoded, and more particularly the tenth and eleventh coefficients undergo a decoding of DPCM type in which the prediction signal necessary to the decoding is previously processed by means ofthe same linear transformation effected in transmission, on said 12 received coefficients being performed after the decoding an antitrasform operation that is complementary to said operation of dis crete Fourier transform effected in transmission, the antitrasformed signal being combined which the information of line START and field START, and with the burst so as to recover the composite video signal. The apparatus carrying out the method is also an object of the present invention. These and other characteristics of the present invention will become clearerfrom the following description of a preferred way of embodiment of the same, taken non in a limiting sense, but by way of examble taken in connection with the annexed drawings in which Fig. 1 is a general scheme of the transmitting end of the encoding system of the composite PAL video signal Fig. 2 is a general scheme describing the receiving end of the same encoding system Fig. 3 is a detailed scheme describing the block denoted by COD in Fig. 1 Fig. 4 is a detailed block diagram depicting the block denoted by DEC in Fig. 2 Fig. 5 is a block diagram that depicts in details tlie block denoted by Ti in Fig. 3. In PAL video signal at the beginning of each line a synchronism signal burst is present consisting, as known, of a sinusoidal signal with a frequency equal toulmodulated colour subcarrier fsc, that can be supposed as obtained from a rotating vector whose position is identified at each instant, in a given orthogonal reference system by the amplitude value and by an angle 2 between the vector itself and one of the axes, or yet from the value of the two projections of the vector on the orthogonal axes. in Fig. 1 reference SU denotes a synchronism unit arranged to receive at the input, connected to wire 1, the video portion of the colour video signal that is to be transmitted and to produce at the output, on wires 2, 3, 4 suitable control signals. More particularly, the signal present on wire 2 times the transmitter, described in the drowning, with the synchronism signals contained in the video signal the signal present on wire 3 consists of a sequence of pulses able to identify the portion of the video signal comprising the decoding of the chromin w ance signal and the composite signal relevant to the image the signal present on wire 4 consists of a sequence of pulses, eachone of them indicating the beginning instant of a field. SUbegins to emit the described signals, that will be interpreted by the blocks receiving them also as enabling signals, beginning from the first of the two fields forming the video franie. The embodirnent of a circuit like SU is not a problem to the skilled in the art as into the video signal are already incorporated portions of the signal having a configuration that can be recognized a priori to identify the various parts. GS denotes a usual oscillator circuit arranged to generate the required sampling frequency fs of the video signal GS is synchronized by the signal it receives from SU through wire 2. More particularly it is advantageous to choose for fs a value dependant on the frequency of the colour subcarrier fsc from relation fs 12 5 fsc 25 liz in this way fs can be easily derived from fsc and the value so obtained for fs satisfies the Nyquist s sampling criterion. A D denotes a usual analog to digital converter that performs the sampling of the video signal present on wire l,at a rythm established by the frequency of signal fs it receives from GS through wire 5. Reference FU1 denotes a logic circuit able to receive at the input from wire 6 the sampled video signal emitted by A D, from wire 3 the signal already examined emitted by SU, and from wire 5 the rythm of the signals present on wire 6. When the burst samples, identified by the signal present on wire 3, are present at the input connected to wire 6, FU1 selects a sequence of 12 samples, chosen beginning from a predetermined sample, and transmits said sequence at the output on connection 7. Afterwards, always dependant on the infor mation present on wire 3, the samples of the composite signal belonging to a line, present on wire 6, are in turn grouped into blocks of 12 samples and each group is sent in sequence to the output on connection 7. At the same time with each group of samples, both of burst and of image signal, FU1 emits on wire 8 an enabling signal whose function will be examined hereinafter. It is now to be noted that tlie subdivision of the line into blocks of 12 samples depends on the choice made on the sampling frequency fs, but it is indipendent of the characterists of PAL signal. By the choice of 12 samples or ofaiiiiiteger multiplek of 12 each block contains 5 complete periods or yet 5K periods of colour subcarrier fsc. As known from the theory, performing in this case the discrete Fourier transform the information carried by the colour subcarrier is basically concentrated into just two coefficients that, if the computation is effected in the increasing frequency range, comes aut to be the 10 th and 11 th or yet, for K i 1, the K 10th and theK 10th 1 coefficient. It is clear that by choosing a different value for sampling frequency fs, also the length of the block is different and that is not prejudicial to the validity of the method used in the present invention in addition it is clear that, by the use of different transformation techniques that can originate a different order of the coefficients, the colour information, even if it remains concentrated into two coefficients can affect a pair of coefficients different from the tenth and the eleventh. For the sake of brevity in the following description reference will be made to the tenth and eleventh coefficients, under the assumption of sequential order, but it is clear that what stated for these coefficients may be applied to the two coefficients on which chrominance information is concentrated. Reference DFT denotes a device able to perform the discrete Fourier transform on the 12 samples it receives at the input on connection 7. Devices as DFT are generally known in the technique. At the output of DFT on connection 9 there are 12 coefficients of the Fourier transform that hereinafter will be referred to as ci .... . c 12, c12 that will be simultaneously sent to two blocks SR and COD, and will be examined later. Reference SR denotes a circuit arranged to detect at the beginning of each line the burst phase by utilizing the coefficients 10 th and 11 th of the Fourier transform present on connection 9 when fromFU1 the enabling signal is sent to SR via wire 8. In fact from what previously stated as to the discrete Fourier transform it can be derived that since the burst is nothing else but a sinusoid having the same frequency as the colour subcarrier, the whole information relating to it is concentrated on the two transform coefficients that, in the frequency order of the coefficients, are still the 10 th and the 11 th coefficients. These coefficients are the projections of the vector on the orthogonal axes the value of the angle 9 , comprised between the vec tor and the horizontal axis, is easy to derive froni tie known trigonometric relationships. Sinus and cosinzus of said angle are respectively obtained from the ratio of the horizontal and vertical projection with the vector modulus defined asEMI8.1 where cb10 and cbll denote the tenth and the eleventh coefficient of the transform relating to the burst samples. The enabling signal is emitted by FU1 at the same time. as the 12 burst samples are sent to DFT. By using coefficients cb10, cb1 1 circuit SR computes also two number alpha ,ss that, emitted at the output on wire 11, will be utilized, as will be seen later, by COD for predicting tile coefficients carrying the chrominance information of the video signal. More particularlyos and are equal to cos 29 and sin 2 when between the line used for the prediction and the next in time the burst undergoes a phase delay of 2 and to cos 2 Q and sin 2 in case of phase lead of f 2 It is now worth noting that the signal going along wire 8 if it is interpreted as enabling signal for SR has a mealling of disabling signal for COD and vice versa. Circuit SR consists of blocks NR, TB, DP1, I1, RAl. BlockNR is able to effect the normalization of the coefficiciits cb10 and cb1 1 it receives from connection 9, according to the normalization factorEMI8.2 in order to obtain sine and cosine functions of the angle Q that defines the burst phase. Block TB is basically composed of a memory into which are registered the functions of arcsineand arc cosine TB is arranged to supply at the out put on wire 10 the value of the angle that corresponds to the sine and cosine computed in NR. Block DP1 is arranged to receive from TB the value of the angle 9 and to supply the sine and cosine functions of the double angle 2 . Block 11 is arranged to invert alternatively at each line one time the sign of sin 29 and next time the sign of cos ,dependant on the phase shift delay lead undergone by the burst, that has as a consequence on the prediction an inversion of the sign of the matrix, defining the linear transformation used for the prediction. As a frame is composed of an odd umber of lines 625 the phase shift at the beginning of a frame is opposite to the one of the preceding frame. As a consequence the lines that occupy the same position in different fields, and more particularly also the two first lines of each field used for the transmission, have a phase shift that is to be determined so as to correctly assign the initial signs to cos 9 9 and sin2. Block RA1 performs this task that, after receiving from wire 4 the signal of field START, compares the values of angle ,9 received from TB, relevant to two successive lines, and emits towards the output connected to Il a signal arranged to force the initial as sign ment by I1 of the sign to cos and of the sign to sin 2e, when between the first and tile second line there is a phase delay of the burst and vice versa cos 29 sine 2 in case of lead. Reference COD denotes a coding circuit that receives at the input the 12 coefficients emitted by DFT on connection 9, the enablingsignal emitted by FU1 on wire 8 the numbers and sent by SR through connection 11, and finally the signal of field START, present on wire 4. The signal processed by COD is emitted at the output on connection 12. In COD a portion of the 12 coefficients is simply coded inPCM and the remaining portion undergoes a coding of type DPCM the working operation and the structure of COD will be examined in details hereinafter in connection with Fig. 3. Reference CS Fig. 1 denotes a source coder arranged to receive from wire 10 the burst phase information, from connection 12 the video portion of the video signal, from wire 4 and from wire 2 respectively the field and line synchronism, from wire 13 the audio signal and the service signals CS is also able to insert suitable specific words denoting the field and line START and to emit at the output, on connection 14 a composite video signal ready to be transmitted upon channel coding. The embodiment of a source coder as CS is not a problem to the skilled in the art. Reference CC denotes a channel coder tlwat adds to the flow of bits coming from CS through wire 14, some bits protecting the information against the noise by utilizing known codes for error correction. The signal present at the output of CC, on wire 15, is the complete video signal produced by the transmitter of Fig. 1. In Fig. 2 references DC and DS denote a channel and source decoder respectively having functions complementary to those of the blocks denoted by Cw and CS respectively in Fig. 1. Also the blocks denoted by DEC, IDFT, FU2 and D A inFig. 2 will have functions perfectly complementary to the blocks denot ed by COD, DFT, FU1 and A D respectively in Fig. 1. The structure of DEC, more particularly, will be examined in connections withFig. 4. Reference GB Fig. 2 denotes a device, whose structure will be examined hereinaiter, able to generate samples of a periodic signal burst of predetermined amplitude, frequency and sampling ratio GB receives from DS, through wire 16, the indication of the initial phase of the burst signal to generate, that is emitted at the output connected with connection 17 in addition GB receives from connection 18 the field synchronism signal. Besides supplying the burst samples, GD also computes numbers o and p, that sent to DEC through wire 22, define the transform utilized by DEC for the prediction of the coefficients c10, c1l. Circuit GB consists of blocks BD, DP2, 12 and RA2. BlocksDP2, I2 and RA2carry out identical functions to blocks Dip1, I1 andRA1 contained in the circuit SR of Fig. 1. Block BD Fig. 2 is able to receive from wire 16 the value of the angle 9 , that identifies the burst phase, and to convert it into a sequence of addresses for the reading of a memory, non represented and belonging to BD. The addresses formed in this way correspond to the position of the memory that contain the burst values, sampled at frequency fs with desired phase and amplitude, said value are made available at the output on connection 17. Reference SC denotes a signal generator able to reproduce in reception all the synchronisms that are necessary to reconstruct the complete video signal frame and line synchronisms and the portion of frame consisting of the first and last lines that do not carry image information and have not been transmitted SC is synchronized by a synchronism word, that is extracted from the video signal through DS and sent to SC through connection 18, and from line synchronism, that receives from DS through wire 29. Reference AS denotes a usual adding circuit able to effect the addition between the image signal coming from 1 A through wire 20 and synchronisin signals coming from SC through connection 19. At the output of AS, on wire 21, is then present the complete analog video signal. It is to be noted that blocks AS and CS cooperate with FU2 in order to carry out tlue inverse function of FUI, so as to render the video signal continuous, recovering all the constant portion signals. In Fig. 3 reference LA denotes a set of logic gates arranged to enable, on the basis of the signal it receives from wire 8, the inputs connected to connection 9, carryng the 12 coefficients of theFourier transform already examined. At the output of LA there are then present said twelve coefficients that undergo the processing that will be examined hereinafter. Coefficients C4, c5, c6, c7, c8, C9, cl2 are coded inPCM in the same number of quantizers denoted by Q4 . 0 . . . a12 the already coded coefficients are denoted. by c4, cg, c6, c7, cg, cg, 12. Said coding follows already known and usual procedures, basically consisting in a separate presentation of each coefficient with a preassigned number of bits on the basis of the statistical properties of the single digital variables known a priory . Coefficients cl c2, and c,3 undergo all the same coding process known as DPCM on the drawing, for a sake of simplicity, only the processing of cl is represented. As known, the DPCM coding consists in the transmitting only the difference,suitably quantized, between a sample and the foreseen value of the same on the basis of the previous coded samples the prediction is carried out by utilizing the statistical properties of the signal that are known a priori . In our case, dealing with coefficients of the transform performed on blocks of 12 contiguous samples of each line, the best correlation exists among coefficients belonging to blocks occupying the same positions in lines subsquent in space but this would entail a half period delay of the frame for the prediction, with the neccssity of utilizing a memory able to contain the transform coefficients of a complete field. In our case, to avoid the use of this memory with all the management complications connected to it, the prediction is effected among coefficients that occupy the same position in lines successive in time. Always in Fig. 3, references S1 and S2 denote two usual adders Q1 denotes a usual quantizer adapted to the statistics of the input signal. Q1 exploits at least two different quantization characteristics one having rough quantization steps for the first line of each field so as to speed up the attainment of the steady condition for the quantization the other with more refined quantizazion steps is intended for the functioning of Q1 under steady condition. For this Q1 receives also through wire 4 the information of filed START. 1 References Q1, Q10, Qllt denote a nuiiiber of blocks that carry out a complementary function to quantizers denoted by Q1,Q10 Q11 respectively. This means that, for instance, while Q1 transfers a signal to m levels, that can be represented by j bits, into another signal at n levels, that can be represented by q bits, where n m and qf j, Q1 converts again the signal out going from Q1 into the signal with j bits for an amount of m available levels, of wich only n are utilized. In fact it is not possible to recover the information that is last by quantization in Q1 Reference SF1 denotes a group of usual shift registers having an equal number to the number of bits required to represent the first coded coefficient, such registers are gifted with so many positions as are the blocks eachone consisting of 12 samples that form the line. On the basis of the scheme, when at the input of S1 signed with a given coefficient is present at the input signed with is also present the coefficient first coded and then decoded, relevant to the same block of the line preceding in tine. The reason for which at the input of S1 such coefficient, first coded and than decoded, instead of the decoded coefficient of the previous line, is present is due to the fact that the latter obviously is not available at the receiver that must use for the prediction the decoded coefficients. As it is necessary for the prediction carried out by the transmitter to coincide with that of the receiver, tile transmitter has n decoding circuit formed by Q1 , S2 and SF1 identical to the one present in the receiver. Thus the value of the coefficient present at the input t of S1 is perfectly identical to the value S1 of the coefficient that has been decoded by the receiver. In S2 the result of the addition effected by S1 is added, after quantization in Q1 and following recover in Q1 of the original number of bits, to said decoding coefficient relevant to tlie line preceding in time the result of S2, that is the new decoded value of the coefficient relevant to the line under examination, is stored in the last position of SF1, with respect to the shift direction, determining at the same time the shift of a position of all the values stored in it. To overcome the uncertainty condition that could be encountered in processing the coefficients of the first line, registers SF1 relevant to the processing of coefficient,cl, are inizialized in known way upon receiving, by means of wire 4, the signal of filed START, at the more probable value of c 1 that, in first approximation can be put in relationship with the mean value of luminance of video images. The initial value of analogous shift registers, not represented in the drawing, relevant to the processing of coefficients c2 and c3 is zero, because such is the most probahle value. Coefficients c 1 0 and c 11. on which the most part of the colour information depends, undergo the same type of DPCM coding as coefficients c 10 c2, c3 with the only variant that the prediction signal, that in case of cl was that directly sent from SF1 to S1 and S2, now undergoes in the block denoted by Ti a particular processing, that will be examined in detail in connection with Fig. 5. This processing takes into account the way in which the chrominance signal is processed in PAL video translllission system. More particularly the operations allowing the correct prediction of chrominance signals c 10 c1 1 consist of a linear transmit sion the connection 11, coming from SR rig. 1 carries to T1 Fig. 3 the value of numbers CX and 0, that define the transiormation. As to what stated above the functions carried out by addersS7, S9, and S8, S10 respectively are perfectly analogous to the functions carried out by S1 and S2 thus the operation of Q1O, Q1 1is analogous to the one of Q1 and the working operation of SF4, SF5 to that of SF1. The inizialization of SF4, and SF5 takes place by means of resetting to zero.

Reference W denotes a normal two cell register, able to receive from filter 11 the previously examined numbers ob and to store and to present them at the output on wires 23 and 24. The operation of the circuit of Fig. 5 will be examined hereinafter. The operation of the device that, according to the invention, effects the digital encoding of composite PAL video system will be now described. A base band analog video signal may be supposed to be available at the transmitter input on wire 1 Fig. 1 . Said signal is sampled and quantized in A D at frequency fs supplied by oscillator circuit GS that in turn is controlled by line synchronism said synchronism is detected by block SU, connected at the input to wire 1, and transmitted to GS via wire 2. It is now worth noticing that, as known, it is not necessary to transmit at the output of the transmitter, in our case from wire 15, all the information relating to the video signal present at the input, in our case on wire 1 and then on wire 6. It is known that the image signal is arranged on 575 lines out of the nominal 625 of the frame. However1 the transmitter does not only transmit the informa tion relating to only 575 useful lines, but also, in order to allow the local oscillator of the receiving apparatus to be locked onto the burst, it will transmitt at least the information relating to the burst it self, present on same lines that do not contain the image more particularly, it will be sufficient to transmit only the phase information assumed on each line, as the burst can be recovered by the receiver beginning from said information. The function of FU1 is the one of separating the signal portions that must be afterwards processed burst, video signal from those that are not necessarily transmitted cancellation, synchronisms . More particularly, as FU1 receives from SU, via wire 3, the information of line START, counts a certain number of period scanned by the signal present on wire 5 for instance 75, corresponding to the completion of line return, and the initial burst transient without emitting any signal, after that it lets through towards output 7t connected to DFT, 12 samples of the burst that are arranged to identify its phase at the same time FU1 emits on wire 8 a signal enabling the input of SR and disabling the input of COD. DFT effects on the 12 samples of burst, received in parallel from FU1 via connection 7, discrete Fourier transform by processing 12 coefficients cbl ...... cbl2 emitted at the output via connection 9 that, being disabled the input of COD, are stored in SR. Among the 12 received coefficients, SR utilizes only the 10th and 11th that is cbl0 and cub11 to compute tile phase9 of the burst, whose value is emitted at the output on wire 10, and the two numbers OL and p that, emitted on the output connected to wire 11, are utilized by COD as will be seen later FU1, once completed the transmission of said 12 burst samples blocks its outputs for a predetermined time duration eo as to wait for the arrival of samples of the image signal to be transmitted. Immediately afterwards FU1 emits on wire 8 a signal complementary to the previons one that enables the input of COD and disables the input of SR at the same time it lets through on connection 7 towards DFT the samples relevant to the image signal, after grouping them into groups of 12 samples at a time to the completion of all the line image samples. The same procedure takes place for all the remaining lines. COD, once enabled by the signal present on wire 8, receives from connection 9 all the coefficients c1............ c12 of the discreteFourier transform operated in DFT and operates, as already seen, on some of them a DPCM coding and on the remaining part a PCM coding. The choice of DPCM coding depends on the possibility of an actual reduction of the signal reconstruction error, that takes place when the coefficient of correlation among the homonymous coefficients c1 ...... c12 in different lines has a value high enough, that is of the orden of 0, 85. In our case, experimental results have shown that this condition is met by coefficients cl, c2, c3 of the luminance signal and by the coefficients c10 and c1 1 of the chrominance signal more particularly, the correlation relating to clo and cll must be evaluated between the coefficient of a line and the coefficient, transformed by means of T1 Fig. 3 , relating to the block that occupies the same position in the line preceding in time. It is obvious that it is possible to operate a different choice of the coefficients relating to the luminance signal, to be coded inDPCM without going out of the scope of the invention. The operation of COD Fig. 3 will be now described under the hy pothesis that there are present in the input, on connection 9, the coefficients relating to the 1st block of the line that in the time order has index r 1. When the coefficient c1 of at first block computed by DFT, is present out the input of S1, SF1 presents at the input of S1 the coded coefficient C1, relating to the first block of line r th. Therefore Q1 receives the difference, represented by j bits, between the two coefficients and quantizes it according to its present characteristic by q bits. The word dl at the output from Q1 is sent via connection 12 to source coder CS Fig. 1 so that it may be arranged for the transmission and at the same time to the input of Q1 Fig. 3 , so that it may be again relied to a representation by j bits. The quantized difference is added in S2 to coefficient cl relating to the first block of line r, and the output of S2, that represents the decoded coefficient S1 of line r 1 , is writhen in the last position of SF1, causing at the same time a shift towards the left of all the other decoded coefficients previously stored, then as S1, relating to line r, is no longer useful, gets last. At this point, at the input of S1 coefficient C1 is present, computed by DFT, relating to the second block of the same line r 1, while in the. first position of SF1, and then at the input of S1, decoded coefficient S1 is present of the second block of line r. The process continues as just examined for all the first coefficients c1 of the remaining blocks of line r 1 once this procedure is completed the same procedure repeats among the first coefficients, computed by DFT, of line r 2 and the coded coefficients of line r 1 to the completion of the field lines. Coefficients c2, C3 are processed analogously. Coefficients c4....... c9 and c 12 undergo just a normal coding of PCM kind in blocks Q4....... Q9 and Q12 respectively. Coefficients c10 c11 undergo a DPCM coding operation analogous to the one already examined for coefficient c1 , with the only important variant consisting in linearly transformiiig by means of block T1 both coded coefficients relevant to line r, supplied by SF4 and SF5. Said linear transformation, that forms one of the specific objects of the present invention, takes into account the three factors that affect the values of chrominance coefficients c 10 and cm 12 under the hypothesis of colour permanency in a block with respect to the homonimous block of the line preceding in time. The three factors are the following 1 phase shift in the burst, that effects an anticipated or delayed ro tation by t 2 between two lines successive in time 2 know sign inversion of one of the two components of the chromi nance signal between a line and the next L. Gouss t, La television monochrome et en couleur , Paris, Eyrolles, 1972, P. 153 3 The line period is not an integer multiple of the period of the colour subcarrier consequently by effecting a frequency analysis of the sample. belonging to the blocks occupying the same position in two lines successive in time, a further phase shift equal to a constant delay of Wf 2 must be taken into account. The linear transformation that takes into account these factors and allows the prediction of the value of the coefficients C10 and c11 of a boock belonging to line r 1 ., beginning from the coded value of c10 and cll relating to the block that occupies the same position in the line r is just the one that is carried out by the scheme of Fig. 5 in our case it is detected by two values only of numbers oz and 3 present on wire 11 and made af the same time available by W on wires 23 and 24 respectively. In practice said transformation is obtained by making the product of the matrix 2 x 2 by matrix 2 x 1 . Said product is made as follows. Number o arrives at multiplier M1 through wire 23 and the decoded chrominance coefficient s 10 r 1 referred to generic line r, through wire 25. Number 0 and, through wire 25, the coefficient 810 r analogously arrive at M2. Number g, through wire 24, and the decoded coefficient of chrominance s ll r, through wire 26, arrive ate3. Finally number 0 arrives at M4 through wire 23 and the cóefficient s 11 2 through wire 26. The signals present at the outputs of niultipliers M1 andM3 are algebraically added in Pl at the output of Pl there is then present the signal p 10 r 1 forming the prediction signal of the chrominance coefficient C10 Fig. 3 referred to generic line r 1. In the same way the signals at the outputs of M2 and M4 Fig. 5 are algebraically added in P2, at whose output there is then present the signal 11 r 1 forming the prediction signal of the chrominance coefficient cll Fig. 3 referred to generic line r 1. It is now worth noticing that the function of the field START signal carried out by wire 4 Fig. 3 depends, as previously described, on the necessity of utilizing for the coefficients of the first useful line a quantization characteristic less refined with respect to that of the other lines this in fact allows, as known, the speed up of the attainment of steady conditions by actually carrying out for the coefficients of the first line a PCM coding. The video signal coded, ad just described, by COD is sent, via connection 12, to CS Fig. 1 where, in conjunction with the other information that may be needed by the receiver for building up the whole message, undergoes, as examined, the so called source coding. From CS, through wire 14, the complete video signal is sent to CC where it undergoes, as already examined, the necessary channel coding in order to be sent to the output on wire 15. The signal present at the input of the receiver is decoded by DC Fig. 2 and by DS that behave in a way perfectly complementary respectively to blocks CC and CS of the transmitter depicted in Fig. 1. In addition also the function of correction of the errors orig ated from transmission channel is carried out in CD in a known way. Then the signal undergoes an inverse process with respect to the one it has undergone in the transmitter by means of the blocks DEC with respect to COD IDFT with respect to DE T, FU2 with respect to FUI D A with respect to A D. The portion of the signal consisting of the burst samples is regenerated in block GP beginning from the inforiiiation of phase 9 of the burst itself. This information is transmitted from DS to GB by means of wire 16 the operation of GB is the one previously seen. Analogously to what has taken place in block COD Fig. 1 of the transmitter, block DEC needs for the prediction of the chromin ance coefficients, numbers oc and R these are computed in block GB Fig. 2 always dependant on the value of phase Fof the burst. At this point all the portions of the video signal, no matter how encoded burst, image signal , have been recovered in digital form and are present at the inputs of FU2 connected to the outputs ofGB and IDFT. FU2, by exploiting the frequency information carried by wires 18 and 29, arranges again in sequential forni in the correct time position the samples of the burst and of the ifliage signal. The video signal processed in this way is reconverted into analog form by converter D A and is then completed in AS with the necessary synchronism signals, comprising line and frame cancellation signals, arriving in analog form from SC via wire 19, and the audio signal, coming from DS via wire 30. The signal present at the output of the receiver, on wire 21, forms then the complete video signal that was required. It is clear that modifications and variations are possible without going out of the scope of the invention.
