# Duct for hot air.

## Abstract
The duct 16 which delivers hot air F to the inside surface of the leading edge of a tubo fan inlet cowl, for de icing of the leading edge 11 , is made double walled 16, 21 in order to safeguard from overheating the materials from which the cowl is constructed in the event of rupture of the duct. Preferably the flow of hot air in the outer duct blows open a hinged door 26 in the skin 10 of the cowl to provide a visual indication of the rupture of the inner duct. The outer duct can be narrow enough to maintain working pressure in the inner duct after rupture.
