# Improvements in and relating to building blocks.

## Abstract
A method of filling a cavity in a building block with aminoplast resin foam comprises locating a template 6,7 against and in sealing relation to that face of the block having said cavity opening therefrom characterised in that an aperture 5 defined in said template and at least as large as the opening in the block which communicates with the cavity is aligned and registered with said opening, followed by passing curable aminoplast resin foam into the cavity under pressure to fill said cavity and form an upstand 9 of foam relative to the face of the block in the space defined by the thickness of the template, and then removing the template to leave at least some of said upstand projecting from said face.
