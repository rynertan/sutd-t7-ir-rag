## Description
Advertisement curtainThe present invention relates to an advertisement curtain to be installed in a window, most suitably the back window of an automobile.It is previously known to attach to the back window of an automobile a sunshade curtain which can be pulled from a roller cassette to cover the back window of the automobile.It is also previously known to attach advertising stickers to the back windows of automobiles, especially taxis. A combination of the above mentioned inventions, i.e.incorporating an advertisement into a curtain to be installed in the back window of a taxi is not possible, since the use of a curtain which hampers visibility is prohibited in taxis.The object of the invention is to introduce an advertisement curtain to be installed in the back window of an automobile, a curtain which is transparent from the inside, but from the outside of which it is possible to read an advertising text or picture printed on it. This is achieved by making the curtain from a large mesh net of the type of a mosquito net.The characteristics of the invention are given in accompanying Claim 1.The mesh size of a net suitable for the purpose can most suitably vary between 1 x 1 mm and 2 x 2 mm. Expressed in another way, the proportion covered by the threads of the net is suitably 15 30 of the total area of the curtain.The advertising text for one side of the advertisement curtain is printed on it by, for example, the silk screen process.The invention is described below also with the aid of one example, with reference to the accompanying drawing, in whichFigure 1 depicts a roller mechanism suitable for use in conjunction with the curtain according to the invention, andFigure 2 is a diagrammatic representation of an advertisement curtain installed in the back window of an automobile.In the figures, reference numeral 1 indicates a roller cassette, which is attached, for example, behind the back rest of the back seat of the automobile, usually to the so called hat shelf at the level of the lower edge of the back window 8. Advantageously a length of normal curtain 2 is attached to the mechanism, and at the end, i.e. the free edge of this curtain, there is a part, for example an adhesive tape 4, suitable for being attached to the advertisement curtain. Attachment lugs 5 and an attachment strip 6 for the attaching of the upper edge of the advertisement curtain 3 are fitted above the back window of the automobile. The strip can also be fixed to the curtain. The curtain is kept taut by the spring in the roller cassette in the normal manner.As presented above, the curtain material is netlike in such a way that it does not notably hamper visibility from the inside. Nevertheless, the advertisement 7 printed on the outer surface of the curtain is seen well from the outside. Owing to the adhesive tape attachment the curtain can be replaced easily and rapidly.
