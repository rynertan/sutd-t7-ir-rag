# Addition polymerizable urethane based anaerobic adhesives made from tin II organoesters.

## Abstract
An addition polymerizable adhesive is prepared by using the reaction product of 1 an isocyanate compound such as 2 isocyanatoethyl methacrylate and 2 an active hydrogen compound such as a poly ethylene glycol Wherein at least one of 1 and 2 has an addition polymerizable double bond, and the other is polyfunctional, or both 1 and 2 have addition polymerizable double bonds, and wherein the reaction between 1 and 2 is catalyzed with a tin II organoester such as stannous octoate and formulating the reaction product of 1 and 2 with a curing amount of a polymerization initiator and a stabilizing amount of a polymerziation initiator. The adhesives of the invention have surprisingly long shelf lives compare to similar adhesives made with other catalysts.
