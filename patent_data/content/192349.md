# POLYIMIDE EMBEDDED CONDUCTOR PROCESS

## Abstract
A polyimide embedded conductor process assures adherence of a metal conductor to a polyimide layer and allows closer spacing between conductors. The conductor is laid on a sacrificial substrate, and then the polyimide layer is laid over the conductor and substrate. The substrate is etched away to expose the conductor, and the polyimide layer may be etched away from the conductor to form attachment tabs.
