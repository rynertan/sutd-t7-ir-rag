## Description
BIOPOLYMER COMPOSITION HAVING ENHANCED FILTERABILITY Biopolymers, particularly those produced by members of the genus Xanthcmonas, have found utility for the past several years in the field of enhanced oil recovery. The filterability of these materials is a key gauge of their injectivity they must also pass readily through subterranean formations in order to aid in oil recovery, It has been known for some years that methylene bis thiocyanate MBT is a potent biocide for a number of microorganisms. Wehner and Binz DevelopmentsIn Industrial Microbiology vcl 21, 1980, p 404 410 demonst c e its use against numerous species of bacteria and also against several algae.US 3,300,375 Wehner teaches growth inhibition of sulfate reducing bacteria with M3T and suggests that MBT be added to water used in oil well flooding operations in order to kill subterranean sulfate reducing bacteria which plug wells.U.S. 3,996,378 Payton teaches a microbiocide corrpositcn made up of Xanthan gel and from 5 20 of MBT which is said to be less toxic than soivent based compositions in various industrial applications. Another characteristic of inorganic thiocyanates that has been noted is their ability to break up cells.For example, L.O. Ingram J. Bacterioi. April 1981, p 331 336 has investigated the chaotropic effect cf sodium thiocyanate on E. coli and Hatefi and Hanstein Proc. N.A.S. vol 62 no. 10, 1969, p 1129 1136 have investigated the more general effect cf chaotropic agents, including thiocyanate anion on water solubility of merr33ranes and particulate proteins. The present invention, for the first time, discloses 2 biopolymer composition of surprisingly superior filterability made up of Xanthan biopolymer and very small amounts of MBT, an organic thiocyanate. The present invention comprises a composition for use in enhanced oil recovery comprising from about 1.5 20 weight percent Xanthomonas biopolyrner in the form of a whole fermentation broth or a concentrated fermentation broth and from about 0.0008 3 weight percent methylene bis thiocyanate , the composition having a pH above about 3.5.

The composition is especially preferred wherein the biopolymer is in the form of a concentratedXanthomonas fermentation broth containing from about 520 weight percent biopolymer, the broth being substan tally free of insoluble matter having a particle size greater than about 3 microns. The compositions named above which also contain from about 300 5000 ppm formaldehyde are also preferred. The compositions named above are also preferred when they are prepared by subjecting them to a post shearing step sufficient to cause a reduction in viscosity effectiveness of said biopolymer of from about 5 30 , preferably of from about 10 15 percent. The present invention also comprises a process to produce a directly injectable Xanthornonas biopolymer solution comprising the steps of 1 admixing a Xanthomonas biopolymer fermentation broth or concentrated fermentation broth containing from about 1.5 20 weIght percent Xanthomonas biopolymer, with methylene bis thiocyanate to a concentration of methylene bis thiocyanate of from about 0.0008 3 weight percent in tne admixture, said admixture having 2 pH above about 3.5 2 after a period of at least about 3 hours, admixing said admixture with from about 300 5000 ppm formaldehyde and 3 diluting said second admixture to a concentration of about 100 to 4000 ppm biopolymer in a vigorous shear field.

A method for the recovery of crude oil from an oil bearing subterranean formation comprising injecting into the formation the diluted and sheared compositions named above is also a part of this invention. Detailed Description cf the Invention The biopolymers suitable in the present invention are those produced by fermentation of members of the genus Xanthomonas, in particular Xanthomonas camtestris, although numerous other species can be employed. Such biopolymers are well known and the literature abounds with their method of preparation. Of particular usefullness in this invention are the biopolymers produced by the processes of US 4,119,546 and US 4,282,321. It is expected that similarly useful biopolymer compositions having improved filterability can be produced using MBT treated broths prepared from otherGram negative, bicpolymer producing microorganisms, particularly members of the genera Pseudomonas,Alcaliaenes, Erwinia, Xlebsiella, Arthrobacter and related geneva. Methylene bis thiocyanate is a product of commerce and it is available from numerous commercial sources.Since MBT is an expensive chemical as well as a toxic one, both economic and environmental advantage is gained by using as little as possible as in the present invention. The formaldehyde employed as an optional ingredient in this invention can be any of a variety of ordinary commercial solutions. Other thiocyanate containing anti microbial agents are expected to have similar filterability improving antimicrobial activity. Examples of such substances include a halomethylthiocyanates chloro , bromo , iodo b vinylene thiocyanates c chloroethylene bis thiocyanate d thiocyanomethylmercaptobenzothiazole e trihalomethylthiocyanates chloro , bromo f l,2,3 tri thiocyanato propane and g 1,2 dibromoethylene bis thiocyanate . In preparing the novel conpositions of this invention bST typically will be added directly to the fermentation tank containing the biopolymer while the mixer agitator is operating. This material can then optionally be concentrated by a variety of methods including ultra filtration see U.S. 3,541,006 and U.S. 4,299,825 for example and evaporation. Alternatively, the fermentation broth can be concentrated with subsequent addition of MBT. If ultrafiltration is used, a convenient method is to add MBT to the ultrafilter s recirculation tank near the end of the concentration cycle. This minimizes MBT loss in the ultrafiltrate. If the MBT treated broth does not have the viscosity characteristics desired for a particular use, it is often desirable to shear the composition in a homogenizer or colloid mill. This shear treatment results in a reduction in effective viscosity. If formaldehyde is to be used, it will also be added at a iater time. A period of at least about 3 hours should elapse before formaldehyde addition and up to 48 hours and even longer is possible. The product is then packaged directly for storage or shipment. It has ben found that the invention works well when fresh water or brines including high salinity and high hardness brines are used for dilution of admixtures containing broth and MBT with or without formaldehyde.It is necessary to subject the diluted composition to sufficient shear or a sufficient period of time to achieve uniform dispersion of the MBT containing broth.In the laboratory the method o Waring Blender shear disclosed in U.S. 4,119,546 works well. For yield use any of a number of commercial homogenizers or blenders can be used. Other additives commonly used in oil fields can also be added. These include oxygen scavengers, corrosion inhibitors etc. The additives should be chemically and physically compatible wi the biopolymer so as not to impair injectivity. The pH stability of MBT in Xanthomonas campestris fermentation broth was determined as follows. An unpreserved no formaldehyde added xanthan broth was prepared according to the method of U.S. Patent 4,119,546.MBT in the form of Busan 110 Buckman Labs, Memphis, Tenn. was added to pH pre adjusted broth samples NaOH, Hwi or H2SO4 added for pH adjustment to provide an activeMBT concentration of 225 ppm Initial readings ere obtained as quickly as possible 60 mins. after treatment of broth. A test was also conducted in pureH2O with added Busan 110. Active MBT concentration was determined by Gas Chromatography after sample dilution with water, extraction with dichioromethane, extract concentration, drying, and dissclution in ethyl acetate.Pure MBT was used for internal multilevel standard calibration. Results are shown in Table I. TABLE I Broth pH Half Life hrs. 4 5300 approx. 5 1400 approx. 6 500 approx. 7 79 7.5 water 23These data clearly show the enhance stability of MBT at lower pH. The activity of MBT against cells of Xanthcmonas camDesvris was tested at various pH levels in formaldehyde free broth see Table 1 . Broths were adjusted to various pH levels as indicated and turbidometric and microscopic examination was made to determine if cell lysis occurred. Results are shown in Table II as a function of MBT concentration and pH. TABLE II MBT Level Sample pH ppm Lysis commat 24 Hrs.

Filterability is a highly useful gauge of how well the biopolymer composition will perform under oil field conditions. The Millipore filterability test is an experimental procedure that measures flow rate through a Millipore filter 0.45 to 5.0 pore size as a function of volume under a constant pressure of 40 psig. The filter ratio is the ratio of the time to collect the fourth 250 ml of mobility control solution to the time to collect the first 250 ml of mobility control solution. A filter ratio of 1.0 indicates that the solution has no plugging tendencies. An acceptable mobility control solution has a filter ratio of 1 to 3 0.45 to 5 Millipore filter 1 preferably 1.7. The desired filter ratio and Millipore filter size for testing of a particular mobility control solution are dependent on the permeability of the subterranean stratum of the oil field for which oil displacement is planned. An alternative test involves the prefiltration of at least 1 liter of mobility control solution at 1450 ppm of biopolymer concentration through a 5 micron Millipore filter followed by a second filtration at a 40 psig pressure drop across a 1.2 micron Versapore filter.The number of milliliters of solution passing through the 1.2 micron filter in 600 seconds or less is taken as a measure of iniectivity. The examples to follow are illustrative and do not limit the scope of the claims. Example 1 A standard untreated xanthan broth was prepared according to the method of U.S. Patent 4,119,546. Broth viscosity assay gave 4.5 activity in the broth. 150 g samples of broth were taken. One was treated with 200 ppm MBT active and the other was untreated. After 2 days samples were diluted in a high hardness test brine and were tested for Versapore 1.2 micron filterability after 5.0 micron Millipore prefiltration.Results are shown below. Versapore Sample Filterability ml sec Untreated 250 ml 600 sec with 200 ppm bET 1000 ml 119 secThis demonstrates the dramatic enhancement of MBT on xanthan broth filterability. Example 2Samples of 150 g each were prepared from the untreated broth over a range of pH and MBT concentrations and compared with formaldehyde controls 3000 ppm formaldehyde after 2 days. Results for diluted and sheared broths 1450 ppm biopolymer are shown below. HCl or NaOH were used for pH adjustement under rapid mixing conditions. The data indicate the number of mls. which passed through the 1.2 micron rated Versapore filter and the number of seconds tested. Tests were stopped at 600 seconds or 1000 ml, whichever came first.Control formaldehyde MBT conc. ppm pH only 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 3.5 330 600 422 600 510 600 610 600 5.0 325 600 335 600 375 600 1000 107 6.5 340 600 313 600 528 600 1000 131 8.5 335 600 450 600 365 600 1000 151 1000 103The results clearly show the superior filterability obtained using higher concentrations of MBT and pH levels above 3.5. However, it is clear that even at the low pH levels, filterability improves. Example 3 To test the effect of MBT on injectivity of diluted xanthan broth, a series of 12 fermentations were performed according to conditions of U.S. Patent 4,119,546 in 4 liter jar fermentors and 5.0 micronMillipore filtration tests and turbidity measurements were made. Three broths were split to receive formaldehyde additions at 3000 ppm in one aliquot and MBT additions at 167 ppm in the other aliquot. All other broths received 167 ppm MBT. Results are given below.
