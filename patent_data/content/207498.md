## Description
This invention relates to a spectrophotometer of the type that the diffraction grating is driven directly by a motor. A sine bar mechanism is known as a device to drive a diffraction grating used as dispersing means in a monochromator. This mechanism has the advantage that the amount of rotation of the screw rod for driving the sine bar, that is, the amount of rotation of the motor for driving the screw rod is in a linear relation to the wavelength of the light emerging from the monochromator. The mechanism, however, has the disadvantage that the structure is complicated. In recent years electronic computers have come to be widely used to control spectrophotometers. In this case the amount of rotation of the motor for driving the diffraction grating is not in a linear relation to the wavelength. However, since the wavelength can be calculated from the amount of rotation of the driving motor, a system for driving the diffraction grating directly by a motor has come to be in increasing use, with the advantage that the mechanical structure is much simplified. Generally, the grating pitch, that is, the spacing between ruled lines or grooves on the diffraction grating differs more or less from one diffraction grating to another. In those spectrophotometers which employ a sine bar mechanism for driving the diffraction grating, the above mentioned difference is corrected by adjusting the length of the sine bar so that there is an exact correspondence between the amount of rotation of the motor and the wavelength obtained. The system for driving the diffraction grating directly by a motor has no such means for mechanically correcting the above mentioned difference in the grating pitch, so that if the grating pitch of a diffraction grating differs from the design or nominal value, the indication of wavelength contains an error. Thus the spectrophotometers of that type have been evaluated as having a low degree of accuracy in wavelength selection. A spectrophotometer according to the preamble of claim 1 is known from the printed publication PATENT ABSTRACTS OF JAPAN, vol. 9, no, 33 P 334 1756 , February 13, 1985 which refers to the patent application document JP A 59 176633. From this publication a direct shaft driving type spectrophotometer is known which comprises a light source, a monochromator including a diffraction grating and a motor for driving said diffraction grating, a sample cell, a photodetector, a data processor and a display unit. Every time a power source is turned on, one of the grating constants stored in a memory is selected in accordance with the difference in the angular position of the grating at two emission lines, so that any deviation from the desired grating constant is corrected automatically. As the real grating constant is established by measurement after each switching on of the spectrophotometer, it always takes a long time until the apparatus is ready for work. In the printed publication PATENT ABSTRACTS OF JAPAN, vol. 8, no. 97 P 272 1534 , May 8, 1984 which refers to the patent application document JP A 59 9523, a wavelength correcting system for spectrophotometers is diclosed. Said wavelength correction is performed by adding or subtracting to from a set reference wavelength a value stored in a digital switch which is, however, not described in detail. Therefore, it is the object of the present invention to develop a spectrophotometer by which the grating constant of the diffraction grating can be adjusted in such a way that after each switching on the spectrophotometer reaches the condition ready for work in a very quick and simple manner. According to the present invention this object could be achieved by providing the features indicated in the characterizing portion of claim 1. Accordingly, an input unit for setting a parameter corresponding to a difference between the nominal and actual grating constant of the diffraction grating is provided, wherein said input unit comprises a plurality of mechanic switches, the on and off conditions of which are combined to express a plurality of data for modifying said nominal grating constant. The data processor for determining the wavelength of the presently emitted light is so arranged as to obtain the wavelength in accordance with the nominal grating constant having been modified with the parrameter set in the input unit. As the diffraction grating constant correction has only to be performed once after each replacement of the diffraction grating, the spectrophotometer can very quickly reach the condition ready to work after each switching on. The spectrophotometer of the invention is provided with means for calculating the wavelength of the light beam emitted by the monochromator from the amount of rotation of the motor for driving the diffraction grating. Said calculation will now be described in more detail. Referring to Fig. 3, suppose that a diffraction grating G is rotatable about an axis perpendicular to the plane of the sheet of paper of the drawing at the origin O of the coordinate system. A light beam L₁ incident on the diffraction grating makes an angle α with the Y axis, and the diffracted light L In the above expression the angle ϑ is proportional to the amount of rotation of the motor, and the grating constant is the inverse of the number The invention will now be described in more detail. Referring to Fig. 1, there is schematically shown a spectrophotometer comprising a light source 10, a monochromator 11, a sample cell 12 and a photodetector 13. The monochromator 11 includes a diffraction grating 14 which disperses the light from the source 10 into a series of wavelengths. A pulse motor M drives the diffraction grating 14 so that a selected one of the wavelengths is taken out of the monochromator. Referring to Figs. 2a and 2b there is shown a sector gear 15 rotatable about an axis 16, and the diffraction grating 14 is mounted on the sector gear 15 with its axis coinciding with the axis 16 of the sector gear 15 for simultaneous rotation therewith. A pinion gear 17 meshes with the sector gear 15 and is driven directly by the pulse motor M. A photodetector 18 for detecting the wavelength origin is provided adjacent one side edge of the sector gear 15 so that when the diffraction grating 14 takes a position coinciding with the X axis of the coordinate system in Fig. 3, the photodetector 18 detects the side edge of the sector gear 15. Referring to Fig. 1, the sample cell 12 contains a sample to be analyzed. The monochromatic light of a selected wavelength passes through the sample so as to be detected by the photodetector 13, which produces an output electrical signal in accordance with the intensity of the detected light. The output from the photodetector 13 is amplified by a preamplifier 19 and applied through an A D converter 20 to a computer 21, which processes the data obtained by the measurement and at the same time controls the operation of the instrument. A display unit 22 indicates the result of the measurement. The computer 21 applies a signal in the form of pulses to a pulse motor driving circuit 23 to drive the pulse motor M for wavelength scanning of the monochromator. At the same time the pulses, which correspond to the amount of rotation of the motor in the previously given expression 1 , are counted, so that the computer 21 calculates from the counted number of the pulses the wavelength λ of the monochromatic light emerging from the monochromator in accordance with the expression 1 . For the calculation the grating pitch The computer 21 is so designed that when the data set in the input unit 24 is zero 0 , the computer calculates the wavelength with the nominal grating pitch as the parameter For wavelength calibration the computer 21 operates in the following manner. There are two ways of calibration. In one of them the position of the diffraction grating for the zeroth order light is first determined and the position thereof corresponding to the 656.1 nm emission line of the light from a deuterium lamp is measured for calibration. In the other method, the positions of the diffraction grating corresponding to the two emission lines of 656.1 nm and 486.0 nm of the light from a deuterium lamp are obtained for calibration. In the former method, first the position of the diffraction grating is roughly detected by the photodetector 18. Then a range adjacent the zeroth order light is searched for a peak to determine the exact position of the diffraction grating for the zeroth order light, and then a range adjacent the wavelength of 656.1 nm is searched for a peak to determine the position of the diffraction grating for the wavelength of 656.1 nm. From the angle A of rotation of the diffraction grating between the position for the zeroth order light and that for the 656.1 nm emission line, the actual number N of the grooves of the diffraction grating is calculated by using the following expression The result of the calculation is indicated on the display unit 22, and in accordance with the indication, the switches S1 S3 are operated to set in the input unit 24 the necessary data for calibration. After that, each time the apparatus is switched on, it is only necessary to determine the position of the diffraction grating for the zeroth order light by peak searching. The computer will then read the on or off conditions of the switches to calculate the wavelength of the monochromatic light now provided by the monochromator. In the latter method in which the two emission lines of the light from the deuterium lamp are used, after the position of the diffraction grating is roughly detected by the photodetector 18, both the positions of the emission lines of the wavelengths of 656.1 nm and 486.0 nm are determined. In this case, the angles of rotation of the diffraction grating from the position thereof for the zeroth order light to the positions thereof for the two emission lines can not be obtained, but only the difference angle ΔA of rotation of the diffraction grating between the positions thereof for the two emission lines can be obtained, so that it is impossible to obtain the actual number N of the grooves of the diffraction grating from the difference angle ΔA . However, it is possible to calculate beforehand the difference angle ΔA between the angles of rotation of the diffraction grating for the two emission lines in each of the seven cases of N N 1, N 2, N N 3 and N N. Therefore, if the difference ΔA is indicated, it is possible to know the actual number N and consequently which of the switches are to be on or off, and the switches are operated accordingly. After that, each time the instrument is switched on, it is only necessary to determine the position of the diffraction grating for 656.1 nm emission line. Then the computer reads the conditions of the switches and calculates the wavelength of the light now provided by the monochromator. In the above embodiment, the wavelength is calculated from the counted number of the pulses applied to the pulse motor. In another embodiment of the invention, there may be provided a read only memory ROM which stores a table containing the counted numbers of the pulses applied to the motor and the corresponding wavelengths obtained in each of the cases of N n where If the wavelength origin can be detected by a suitable mechanism with a high degree of accuracy and precision, wavelength calibration can be conducted with only one emission line of a known wavelength. In accordance with the invention, a high degree of accuracy and precision can be attained in wavelength selection with a relatively simple mechanism for driving the diffraction grating.
