# MANUFACTURE OF CRACKING CATALYSTS

## Abstract
By product fines from the manufacture of zeolitic crack ing catalysts from microspheres of calcined clay have here tofore been discarded as a waste stream. These fines, re covered as a moist cake, are slurried in a sodium, silicate solution, spray dried to form microspheres and ion ex changed to produce cracking catalysts which produce low levels of coke during use.
