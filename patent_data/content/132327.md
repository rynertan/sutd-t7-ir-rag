# A PLANAR ELECTRONIC FILTER ELEMENT AND A CONNECTOR EMBODYING SUCH A FILTER

## Abstract
A planar electronic filter has at least two dielectric plates with a ground plate between them and a plurality of parallel spaced electrodes on the outer surface of each plate. A con tact area on at least one end surface connects with the ground plate. Usually contact pins are mounted, as by soldering, on the electrodes, a pin on each electrode, with the ends of the pins extending beyond the sides of the plates. The pin ends may be of male or female form, or can be formed for solder or wire wrapping attachment of conductors. The filter is generally mounted in a housing and it can be arranged that contact pins are not mounted on the electrodes but contact members in the housing make direct contact with the electrodes. A connector embodying the filter can comprise one or two housings. One housing can insert into the other and make contact with the fil ter.
