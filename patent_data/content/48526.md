# VITREOUS FRIT AND FIRED SANITARY WARE BODY

## Abstract
A process for producing feldspathic sanitary ware and the end product are disclosed in which a fluxing amount of a glass frit is used in the ceramic slip used to cast the sanitary ware. The frit contains both deflocculent oxides and floccu lent alkaline earths which are leachable from the frit when it is placed in the ceramic slip. The deflocculent oxides counterbalance the effect of the flocculent alkaline earths to the extent they are respectively leached from the frit upon dispersal in a ceramic slip and maintain the slip at a workable viscosity. Upon casting and firing the slip, the present frit precipitates fine crystals of diopside having an average particle size of less than one micron which are particularly useful in lowering the firing temperature of feldspathic bodies by promoting the required degree of vitrification at lower temperatures than heretofore possible.
