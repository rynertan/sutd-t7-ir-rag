# Fluorinated p doped microcrystalline semiconductor alloys and method of preparation.

## Abstract
A fluorinated, boron doped p type silicon based semi conductor microcrystalline alloy containing a sufficient con centration of crystalline inclusions to improve material properties substantially and a method of preparing the alloy. Single and multiple cell photovoltaic devices including the alloy in at least one layer exposed to incoming light have improved fill factors and efficiencies.
