# Motor control apparatus.

## Abstract
A motor control apparatus for driving and controlling a motor, in which a signal frequency proportional to a rotation number of the motor is converted into a d.c. voltage by a frequency voltage converter so as to drive and control the motor by the d.c. voltage. The apparatus comprises a first, a second, and a third pulse generator 12, 13, 14 for succes sively producing a first, a second, and a third repetitive pulse, respectively, in response to a signal period proportional to the rotation number of the motor a constant current source 36, 48, 56 a first reset circuit 17 driven by the third pulse to reset an output current of the constant current source a first capacitor 20 connected to the first reset circuit in parallel with the first reset circuit and charged by the output current of the constant current source a sampling circuit 18 driven by the second pulse to derive a saw tooth wave signal appearing across the first capacitor a second reset circuit 19 driven by the first pulse a second capacitor 21 connected to the second reset circuit in parallel therewith for charging the saw tooth wave signal through the sampling circuit and a circuit 49, 57 for changing a pulse width of at least one of the first, second and third pulses substantially in proportion to the output current of the constant current source.
