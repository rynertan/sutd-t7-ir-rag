## Description
PROCESS FOR PRODUCING SURFACE TREATED FERROMAGNETIC PARTICLES AND MAGNETIC RECORDING MEDIUM USING SUCH PARTICLES BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a process for producing surface treated ferromagnetic particles suitable for use in high density recording. The invention also relates to a magnetic recording medium using such magnetic particles.2. Description of the Prior Art Conventional magentic recording media such as audio tape and video tape comprise non magnetic bases such as polyethylene terephthalate coated with mixtures of ferromagnetic particles and binders such as vinyl chloride vinyl acetate copolymer, cellulosic resins, epoxy resins and polyurethane resins. These binders used individually or in combination are unable to disperse the ferromagnetic particles thoroughly and uniformly, and the resulting magnetic recording medium does not have completely satisfactory surface properties and wear resistance. For video tape that requires recording at shorter wavelengths, a poor dispersion of ferromagnetic particles in the magnetic layer reduces not only the S N ratio but also the sensitivity.Furthermore, due to repeated rubbing of the tape against the magnetic head in recording and reproduction modes, the magnetic coat wears and the ferromagnetic particles in that coat easily shed off and build up on the head. Many compounds have been proposed as additives that improve the dispersibility of ferromagnetic particles or increase the wear resistance of the magnetic coat. For example, Japanese Patent Publications Nos. 18064 66, 186 68, 669 68, 15624 72, JapanesePatent Applications OPI Nos. 53402 74, 58804 74, 84405 74, 40904 76 and 70811 77 the symbol OPI as used herein means an unexamined published Japanese patent application prepare a magnetic paint containing ferromagnetic particles and a binder, incorporate in the paint higher aliphatic acids, aliphatic acid amides, alipahtic acid esters, higher alcohols, metal soaps, sulfate esters of higher alcohols, polyethylene oxide or lecithin, and applying the resulting magnetic paint onto a non magnetic base to produce a magnetic recording medium.However, even these additives do not always ensure the production of magnetic recording media having the desired characteristics. For one thing, these additives cannot be used in a great amount without decreasing the mechanical strength of the magnetic layer. The additives gradually ooze out of the magnetic layer, and this phenomenon, generally called blooming , must be prevented in order to keep the recording medium for an extended period. Furthermore, the magnetic characteristics of the magnetic layer and the dispersibility of the ferromagnetic particles are far from being completely satisfactory. The technique of treating the surface of ferromagnetic particles with a surfactant has been proposed in order to increase the dispersibility of the ferromagnetic particles without causing blooming .According to the method described in Japanese PatentPublication No. 1048 82, an lipophilic surfactant such as lecithin is added to an organic solvent such as methyl ethyl ketone or toluene, and after dispersing ferromagnetic particles in the resulting solution, the particles with the coat of surfactant are filtered, dried first with air, and then in vacuum. When the ferromagnetic particles that have been given the surface treatment by this method are used, no blooming will occur in the final magnetic recording medium, but on the other hand, the dispersibility of the magnetic particles is far from being completely satisfactory. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Therefore, the objects of the present invention are to provide a new process for producing surfacetreated ferromagnetic particles and to present a new magnetic recording medium using these particles. the specific objects are listed below. One object is to provide a process for producing surface treated ferromagnetic particles having high dispersibility. Another object is to provide a magnetic recording medium having high wear resistance. Still another object is to provide a magnetic recording medium having long term stability. A further object is to provide a magnetic recording medium having good S N ratios. A sitll further object is to provide a magnetic recording medium having high reproduction output. The first mentioned object of the present invention can be achieved by a process for producing surface treated ferromagnetic particles by dispersing ferromagnetic particles in an electrolytic solution and then treating said particles with a surfactant having electric charges of a polarity opposite to that of the charges on the surfaces of said particles. In a preferred embodiment, the electrolytic solution having the ferromagnetic particles dispersed therein is treated with a solution of said surfactant in a hydrophilic solvent, and a hydrophobic solvent is added to the so treated solution to transfer the ferromagnetic particles into the layer of the hydrophobic solvent for their recovery.In another preferred embodiment, the electrolytic solution having the ferromagnetic particles dispersed therein is treated with a solution of said surfactant in a hydrophobic solvent so as to trnasfer the ferromagnetic particles into the layer of the hydrophobic solvent for their recovery. The second to fifth objects of the present invention can be attained by a magnetic recording medium which has formed on a non magnetic base a magnetic layer containing the surface treated ferromagnetic particles prepared by dispersing ferromagnetic particles in an electrolytic solution and then treating said particles with a surfactant having electric charges of a polarity opposite to that of the charges on the surfaces of said particles. In a preferred embodiment, said electrolytic solution having the ferromagnetic particles dispersed therein is treated with a solution of said surfactant in a hydrophilic solvent, and a hydrophobic solvent is added to the so treated solution to transfer said ferromagnetic particles into a layer of said hydrophobic solvent for their recovery. In another preferred embodiment, the layer of the hydrophobic solvent into which the surface treated ferromagnetic particles have been transferred to form a dispersion is further mixed with a binder, and the resulting mixture is applied to the non magnetic base to thereby from a magnetic layer. In still another preferred embodiment, the electrolytic solution having the ferromagnetic particles dispersed therein is treated with a solution of said surfactant in a hydrophobic solvent so as to transfer the ferromagnetic particles into the layer of the hydrophobic solvent for their recovery.In a further preferred embodiment, the layer of the hydrophobic solvent into which the surface treated ferromagnetic particles have been transferred to form a dispersion is subsequently mixed with a binder, and the resulting mixture is applied to the non magnetic base to form a magnetic layer. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS There are two types of electrolytes that can be used in the present invention one is of the type that charges the surface of the ferromagnetic particles negatively, and the other type charges them positively.Examples of the first type of electrolytes are NaOH,KOH, 3 O4 Na4p207, Na4P4O12, Na2Si 3, Na4SiO4, Na2WO4, 3 4 4P207 K4P4012, K2SiO3, K4SiO4 and K2WO4.Examples of the second type include All13, FeC13 and TiC14. The concentration of the electrolyte solution varies with the type of the electorlyte and the isoelectric point of the ferromagnetic particles. In order to charge the ferromagnetic particles positively, the electrolyte is dissolved in a concentration that provides a pH lower than the isoelectric point of the ferromagnetic particles. For charging the ferromagnetic particles negatively, the electrolyte is dissolved in a concentration which is so controlled as to provide a pH higher than the isoelectric point of the magnetic particles. The electrolyte solution is used in an amount of 20 ml to 5,000 ml, preferably from 50 ml to 2,000 ml, per 100 g of the ferromagnetic particles. According to the present invention, the ferromagentic particles are dispersed in the electrolytic solution by a ball mill, sand grinder, high speed impeller disperser, high speed mixer or a homogenizer.When the ferromagnetic particles are dispersed in the electrolytic solution, shearing force will work effectively to reduce the proportion of agglomerating ferromagnetic particles. In most cases, water is a satisfactory solvent for making the electrolytic solution, but if necessary, various hydrophilic organic solvents may be used.Suitable examples are alcohols such as straight chain or branched chain alcohols having 1 to 8 carbon atoms, alcohol ethers and polyhydric alcohols e.g. methanol, ethanol, ethoxyethanol and ethylene glycol ketones having 3 to 6 carbon atoms e.g. acetone and methyl ethyl ketone hydrophilic ethers such as tetrahydrofuran and dioxane and nitrogen containing hydrophilic solvents such as N methylpyrrolidone, dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide and pyridine. These solvents are used in an amount of not more than 50 parts by weight, preferably not more than 20 parts by weight, per 100 parts b weight of water. An aqueous solutoin of electorlyte is particularly preferred. Ferromagnetic metal particles easily corrode if their surface is charged positively, so an electrolyte of the first type that provides negative charges is preferred if ferromagnetic metal particles are used.For ferromagnetic particles made of metallic compounds, either type of electrolytes may be used. A wide variety of ferromagnetic particles may be used in the present invention and they include those which are made of metallic compounds such as y Fe2O3, Foe304, Co containing y Fe2O3, Co containing Fe3O4 and CrO metals such as Fe and Co and alloys thereof. After the ferromagnetic particles are dispersed in the electrolytic solution, they are treated with a surfactant having electric charges of a polarity opposite to that of the charges on the surface of the ferromagnetic particles. Therefore, if the electrolyte is of the type that charges the surface of the electromagnetic particles negatively, a cationic surfactant is used, and if the electrolyte is of the type that charges the surface of the ferromagnetic particles positively, an anionic surfactant is used. The combination of two techniques, i.e. dispersing the ferromagnetic particles in the electrolytic solution and the subsequent treatment of the charged ferromagnetic particles with a surfactant having charges of an opposite polarity, is believed to help form a stable layer of the surfactant adsorbed onto the surface of the ferromagnetic particles, which are thereby given the desired high dispersibility. Much lower dispersibility was accomplished when the ferromagnetic particles were treated in other manners, i.e.they were first charged negatively and then treated with an anionic surfactant, or they were first charged positively and then treated with a cationic surfactant. Illustrative cationic surfactants include quaternary ammonium salts, ammonium salts of higher alkylamines, nitrogen containing heterocyclic compounds such as pyridine, as well as ammonium salts, phosphonium salts and sulfonium salts thereof. Illustrative anionic surfactants include carboxylic acid salts such as sodium stearate, sodium palmitate, sodium oleate and potassium laurate carboxylic acid salts having an ether bond such as sodium cetyloxyacetate and sodium p decylphenoxyacetate carboxylic acid salts having an amide bond such as sodium dodecylsulfonamideacetate and potassium cetylsulfonamideacetate carboxylic acid salts having an amino group such as sodium laurylaminoacetate and sodium decylaminopropionate carboxylic acid salts having an ester bond such as sodium salt of monoester of dodecyl alcohol and phthalic acid salts of esters of aliphatic alcohols and sulfuric acid such as sodium stearylalcohol sulfate and ammonium laurylalcohol sulfate sulfate salts of polyethylene glycol ethers such as sodium lauryl polyethylene glycol ether sulfate and sodium p octylphenyl polyethylene glycol ether sulfate sulfate ester salts having an amide bond such as sodium stearamideethanol sulfate and sodium poctylbenzamideethanol sulfate sulfate ester salts having an ester bond such as sodium butyl sulfooleate sulfonate salts such as sodium cetylsulfonate and sodium p decylbenzenesulfonate sulfonate salts having a hydroxyl group such as sodium ss hydroxydodecyl sulfonate sulfonate salts having an ester bond such as sodium isopropyl a sulfostearate and sodium bis 2ethylhexyl sulfosuccinate sulfonate salts having an amide bond such as sodium butylamide a sulfolaurate sulfonate salts having a cyano group such as sodium a cyanoacetylsulfonate sulfonate salts having an amino group such as sodium salt of N tetradecyltaurine sulfonate salts having an ether bond such as ss dodecyloxyethyl sulfonate sulfonate salts having a sulfide bond such as sodium laurylthiomethanesulfonate and phosphate ester salts such as dodecyl alcohol phosphate monoester disodium and decylalcohol phosphate diester monosodium. These surfactants are used in an amount of 0.05 to 50 parts by weight, preferably 0.1 to 10 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the ferromagnetic particles.If the content of these surfactnats is less than 0.05 part by weight, their effect is not fully exhibited, and if their content is more than 50 parts by weight, emulsification occurs. These surfactants may be used with water alone.Instead, they may be mixed with one of the hydrophilic solvents described in connection with the electrolytic solution. Alternatively, the surfactants may be mixed with solvents containing one of these hydrophilic solvents and water in any desired proportions. The surfactants listed above may be used in the form of a solution in a hydrophobic organic solvent such as hexane, heptane, carbon tetrachloride, methylene chloride, benzene or toluene. When the surfactants according to the present invention are used in the form of a solution in water or one of the hydrophilic solvents mentioned above, 70 to 99 parts by weight of the solvent is preferably used for 1 to 30 parts by weight of the surfactant. Therefore, if 5 parts by weight of the surfactant is to be used per 100 parts by weight of ferromagnetic particles, 50 parts by weight of a 10 wt solution of the surfactant a mixture of 90 parts by weight of water and or a suitable hydrophilic solvent and 10 parts by weight of the surfactant may be used. Alternatively, 20 ml to 5,000 ml, preferably from 50 1 to 2,000 ml of a solution having the surfactant dissolved in a hydrophilic solvnet e.g. methanol, ethanol or aceton may be used per 100 g of the ferromagnetic particles. If the surfactant according to the present invention is used in the form of a solution in one of the hydrophobic solvents, the composition of the solution is such that 1 to 30 parts by weight of the surfactant is dissolved in 70 to 1,000 parts by weight of the hydrophobic solvent. Therefore, if 5 parts by weight of the surfactant is to be used per 100 parts b weight of ferromagnetic particles, 250 parts by weight of a 2 wt solution of the surfactant may be used. The ferromagnetic particles, surfactant, hydrophilic solvent and or water, and hydrophobic solvent may be used in various proportions as defined above. The surfactant used in the present invention may be either cationic or anionic, but cationic surfactants are preferred because, as already mentioned, electrolytes that charge the ferromagnetic particles surfaces negatively are preferred for the purposes of the present invention. According to the present invention, ferromagnetic particles are first dispersed in a solution of the electrolyte described above and then, the resulting dispersion is treated with a surfactant having electric charges of a polarity opposite to that of the charges on the surfaces of the ferromagnetic particles.Here, there are two concrete means of adding the surfactant to said dispersion as follows 1 the surfactant is added directly to the dispersion or is added in the form of an aqueous and or hydrophilic solution, and 2 the surfactant is added in the form of a hydrophobic solution. In case 1 above, for subsequently obtaining the surface treated ferromagnetic particles according to the present invention, either one of the following two processes is selected a the so treated dispersion is filtered and the residue is dried, and b a hydrophobic solvent is added to the said so treated dispersion the resulting dispersion naturally separates into two layers, a hydrohpobic solvent layer and an aqueous and or hydrophilic solution layer, and the surface treated ferromagnetic particles are transferred into the hydrophobic solvent layer , then the hydrophobic solvent layer is separated from the aqueous and or hydrophilic solution layer and filtered and the residue is dried. In case 2 above, the hydrophobic solvent layer is separated from the aqueous and or hydrophilic solution layer in the same manner as in process b above and filtered and the residue is dried, whereby the surface treated ferromagnetic particles according to the present invention can be obtained. Suitable hydrophobic solvents include straightchain or branched chain aliphatic hydrocarbons having 5 to 14 carbon atoms, alicyclic hydrocarbons having 5 to 11 carbon atoms, substituted preferably halogenor alkyl substituted or unsubstituted aromatic hydrocarbons having 6 to 18 carbon atoms, cyclic or noncyclic ketones having 4 to 10 carbon atoms, and aliphatic hydrocarbons containing at least one halogen atom having 1 to 10 carbon atoms. Among these hydrocarbons, those having solubility parameter SP values of 7.0 or more but less than 10.0 at 250C are preferred. Because of ease of handling and separation from the aqueous layer, the aliphatic hydrocarbons, alicyclic hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, and halogencontaining aliphatic hydrocarbons defined above are preferred, and the first three groups of hydrocarbons are particularly preferred. Specific examples of the preferred hydrophobic solvents are pentane, hexane, heptane, octane these four solvents may be straightchain or branched chain , cyclopentane, cyclohexane, cycloheptane, cyclooctane, benzene, toluene, xylene, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform and methylene chloride. These hydrophobic solvents may be used either alone or in combination. The amount of the hydrohpobic solvents vary with their type, and generally they are used in an amount of 20 ml to 5,000 ml, preferably from 50 ml to 2,000 ml, per 100 g of the ferromagnetic particles. Upon addition of these hydrophobic solvents, the electrolytic solution treated with a surfactant separates into an hydrophobic solvent layer a hydrophobic liquid layer and an aqueous layer a hydrophilic liquid layer . Those ferromagnetic particles the surface of which has been rendered adequately hydrophobic migrate into the hydrophobic solvent layer, whereas those which have not been rendered fully hydrophobic are left in the aqueous layer. Therefore, by removing the aqueous layer, a dispersion that selectively contains the ferromagnetic particles whose surface has been rendered adequately hydrophobic can be obtained and this is characterized by a uniform dispersion of the surface treated ferromagnetic particles. A detailed description of the good dispersibility or the surface treated ferromagnetic particles prepared according to the process of the present invention will be found in the Examples, but suffice it to say here that one measure for the dispersibility of the ferromagnetic particles is sedimentation velocity of the ferromagnetic particles in n hexane. The good dispersibility of the surface treated ferromagnetic particles and the dispersion of such particles is of great help in preparing a magnetic paint that is characterized by a good dispersion of ferromagnetic particles and hence is particularly suitable for use in the production of magnetic recording media. Other fields that may benefit from the good dispersibility of the surface treated ferromagnetic particles are those of magnetic fluids and pigments. The sedimentation velocity of ferromagnetic particles in n hexane is expressed by the depth in millimeters of a suspension of the particles 1 g formed below the surface of n hexane which has been left to stand for 24 hours after l minute shaking in a sedimentation tube having an inside diameter of 10 mmi and an inner capacity of 30 ml. The ferromagnetic particles are said to have good dispersibility if their sedimentation velocity is between 0 and 100 mm, preferably between 0 and 10 mm. The sedimentation velocity of ferromagnetic particles may be considered as indicating the degree of agglomeration of the ferromagnetic particles the lower the sedimentation velocity, the smaller the proportion of the agglomerating particles . Another index for the dispersibility of the ferromagnetic particles is how hydrophobic their surface is. This can be measured by suspending the ferromagnetic particles in several solutions e.g. mixed solvent of water and methanol having known values of surface tension and seeing if they float or are slightly dispersed in any of the solutions tested.The surface tension of the solution on which the particles float or in which they are slightly dispersed is taken as the degree of hydrophobicity of the particles, and the smaller the degree of hydrophobicity, the higher the dispersibility of the ferromagnetic particles in this case, the dispersibility under hydrophobic conditions . The present inventors confirmed that the ferromagnetic particles whose surface was treated by the method of the present invention had a very good dispersibility whether it was evaluated in terms of sedimentation velocity or degree of hydrophobicity. The resulting surface treated ferromagnetic particles are mixed and dispersed in a suitable solvent together with a binder so 2S to for a macnetic paint The magnetic paint is then applied onto a non magnetic base to form a magnetic recording medium having the desired magnetic layer. The dispersion of the surfacetreated ferromagnetic particles according to the present invention may be concentrated, dried and mixed with a binder to form a magnetic paint, which is again spread onto a non magnetic base. By this method, too, a magnetic recording medium having the desired magnetic layer can be produced. Whichever method is used, the resulting magnetic paint may contain a dispersant, lubricant, abrasive, antistatic agent or any other necessary additive. For further details of the method of preparing magnetic paints, see Japanese Patents No. 15 60, No. 26794 64,No. 186 68, No. 28043 72, No. 28045 72, No. 28046 72, No. 28048 72, No. 31445 72, No. 11162 73, No. 21331 73 and No. 33683 73 German Patent Applicatoin OLS No.2060655 and Russian Patent No. 308033. A binder is incorporated in the magnetic layer of the magnetic recording medium of the present invention, and any known thermoplastic resins, thermosetting or reactive resins, resins that cure upon irradiation with electron beams, as well as mixtures of these resins may be used as the binder. Suitable thermoplastic resins have a softening point of less than 1500C, an average molecular weight of about 10,000 to 200,000, and a degree of polymerization of about 200 to 2000. Examples of such polymers are vinyl chloride vinyl acetate copolymer, vinyl chloride vinylidene chloride copolymer, vinyl chloride acrylonitrile copolymer, acrylic acid ester acrylonitrile copolymer, acrylic acid ester vinylidene chloride copolymer, acrylic acid ester styrene copolymer, methacrylic acid ester acrylonitrile copolymer, methacrylic acid ester vinylidene chloride copolymer, methacrylic acid ester styrene copolymer, urethane elastomer, polyvinyl fluoride, vinylidene chloride acrylonitrile copolymer, butadiene acrylonitrile copolymer, polyamide resin, polyvinyl butyral, cellulose derivative e.g. cellulose acetate butyrate, cellulose diacetate, cellulose triacetate, cellulose propionate, or nitrocellulose , styrene butadiene copolymer, polyester resin, chlorovinyl ether acrylic acid ester copolymer, amino resins, various synthe rubber thermoplastic resins and mixtures thereof. Specific examples of these resins are given inJapanese Patent Publications Nos. 6877 62, 12528 64, 19282 64, 5349 65, 20907 65, 9463 66, 14059 66, 16985 66, 6428 67, 11621 67, 4623 68, 15206 68, 2889 69, 17947 69, 18232 69, 14020 70, 14500 70, 18573 72, 22063 72, 22064 72,22068 72, 22069 72, 22070 72, and 27886 73, as well asU.S. Patents Nos. 3,144,352, 3,419,420, 3,499,789 and 3,713,887. The thermosetting or reactive resin is such that it has a molecular weight of less than 200,000 when it is in coating solution and that after application and drying of a coating solution, its molecular weight is increased infinitely due to condensation, addition or other reactions. Preferred thermosetting or reactive resins are those which do not soften or melt until they are decomposed with heat.Specific examples are phenolic resins, epoxy resins, polyurethane curable resin, urea resin, melamine resin, alkyd resin, silicone resin, acrylic reactive resin, a mixture of high molecular weight polyester resin and isocyanate prepolymer, a mixture of methacrylic acid salt copolymer and diisocyanate prepolymer, a mixture of polyester polyol and polyisocyanate, urea formaldehyde resin, low molecular weight glycol highmolecular weight diol triphenylmethane triisocyanate mixture, polyamine resins and mixtures thereof. Specific examples of these resins are found inJapanese Patent Publications Nos. 8103 64, 9779 65, 7192 66, 8016 66, 14275 66, 18179 67, 12081 68, 28023 69 14501 70, 24902 70, 13103 71, 22067 72, 22072 72, 22073 72, 28045 72, 28048 72 and 28922 72, as well as U.S.Patents Nos. 3,144,353, 3,320,090, 3,437,510, 3,597,273, 3,781,210 and 3,781,211. Illustrative resins that cure upon irradiation with electron beams include unsaturated prepolymers such as maleic anhydride type, urethane acrylic type, epoxy acrylic type, polyester acrylic type, polyether acrylic type, polyurethane acrylic type and polyamide acrylic type, as well as polyfunctional monomers such as ether acrylic type, urethane acrylic type, epoxy acrylic type, phosphate ester acrylic type, aryl type and hydrocarbon type. The above listed binders may be used either alone or in combination with themselves or Other additives. The binder is used in an amount of 10 to 400 parts by weight, preferably 30 to 200 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the surface treated ferromagnetic particles of the present invention. If the binder is used in an excessive amount, the resulting magnetic recording medium has a low recording density, and if the binder content is too low, a weak magnetic layer which is less durable and sheds off easily is formed. In order to produce a highly durable magnetic recording medium, various curing agents may be incorporated in the magnetic layer, and a polyisocyanate is a suitable curing agent. Illustrative polyisocyanates are addition products of diisocyanate and trivalent polyols, diisocyanate pentamers, and decarboxylation products of 3 mols of diisocyanate and water. More specifically, suitable curing agents include an adduct of 3 mols of tolylene diisocyanate and 1 mol of trimethylolpropane, an adduct of 3 mols of metaxylylene diisocyanate and 1 mol of trimethylolpropane,a tolylene diisocyanate pentamer, a pentamer made of 3 mols of tolylene diisocyanate and 2 mols of hexamethylene diisocyanate, and a decarboxylation product prepared by reacting 3 mols of hexamethylene diisocyanate and 1 mol of water. All of these compounds can easily be produced on an industrial scale. Besides the surface treated ferromagnetic particles, the binder and curing agent described above, the magnetic layer may contain other additives such as dispersants, lubricants, abrasives and antistatic agents. Examples of the dispersant are aliphatic acids having 8 to 18 carbon atoms R1COOH wherein R1 is a saturated or unsaturated alkyl group having 7 to 17 carbon atoms caprylic acid, capric acid, lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, elaidic acid, linoleic acid and linolenic acid. Metal soaps made of alkali metals Li, Na, K. etc. or alkaline earth metals mug, Ca, Ba, etc. of these aliphatic acids, as well as lecithins may also be used as the dispersant.Higher alcohols having 12 or more carbon atoms, as well as sulfate esters of these alcohols are also usable.Also usable are the surfactants that have been described in connection with the production of the surface treated ferromagnetic particles of the present invention or thei r dispersion. These dispersants and those listed above may be used either individually or in admixture in an amount of 0.1 to 20 parts by weight for 100 parts by weight of the binder.

Various solvents may be used for preparing a magnetic paint or as an aid to the application of the magnetic paint. Suitable solvents include ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone and cyclohexanone alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol and butanol esters such as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, ethyl lactate, and glycol acetate monoethyl ehter glycol ehters such as glycol dimethyl ether, glycol monoethyl ether and dioxane aormatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene and xylene chlorinated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride, ethylene chloride, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, and dichlorobenzene. Suitable non magnetic bases include polyesters such as polyethylene terephthalate and polyethylene 2,6naphthalate polyolefins such as polypropylene cellulose derivatives such as cellulose triacetate and diacetate plastics such as polycarbonate non magnetic metals such as aluminum, copper, and zinc and ceramics such as glass, porcelian and earthenware. The thickness of these non magnetic bases varies with their physical shape. For films and sheets, the thickness is between about 3 and 100 wm, preferably fro 5 to 50 pm for disks and cards, the thickness ranges from about 30 pm to 10 mm. The bases may be in a cylindrical drum shape whose specific configuration is determined by the type of the recorder with which the magnetic recording medium of the present invention is used. The back surface opposite the side having the magnetic coating of the base may be provided Backcoat layer for various purposes, e.g. prevention of electrification and transfer. For detailed information on the technique of forrinc the backcoat, see U.S. Patents Nos. 2,804,401, 3,293,066, 3,617,378, 3,062,676, 3,734,772, 3,476,596, 2,643,048, 2,803,556, 2,887,462, 2,923,642, 2,997,451, 3,007,892, 3,041,196, 3,115,420, and 3,166,688. The non magnetic base may be in the form of a film, tape, sheet, disc, card, drum or other suitable shapes, and a suitable material is selected from among various materials depending on its form. The surface treated ferromagnetic particles according to the present invention or their dispersion, as well as the binder, dispersant, lubricant, abrasive, antistatic agent and solvent are mixed to form a magnetic paint. The magnetic paint is prepared by charging a kneading machine with the surface treated ferromagnetic particles or their dispersion and all other ingredients simultaneously or sequentially. For instance, the ferromagnetic particles are added to a solution containing the dispersant, and the mixture is stirred for a predetermined period, and then, the other ingredients are added under stirring. Various kneading machines may be used to achieve thorough mixing of the magnetic paint composition.Examples are a two roll mill, three roll mill, ball mill, pebble mill, sand grinder, Szegvari attritor, highspeed impeller disperser, high speed stone mill, highspeed impact mill, disperkneader, high speed mixer, homogenizer and ultrasonic disperser. The magnetic paint prepared according to this method is characterized by a highly uniform dispersion of the ferromagnetic particles, and when their dispersibility was evaluated by the method described in the Examples that are given later in this specification, much fewer agglomerates were observed under electron microscope than in the case of the conventional magnetic paint. For details of the kneading and dispersing technique, see T.C. Patton, Paint Flow and PigmentDispersion , John Wiley Sons, 1964 , as well asU.S. Patents Nos. 2,581,414 and 2,855,156. A magnetic layer is formed from the magnetic paint on a base by air doctor coating, blade coating, air knife coating, squeeze coating, impregnate coating, reverse roll coating, transfer roll coating, gravure coating, kiss coating, cast coating, spray coating, and others. For details of these and other coating techniques, see Coating Kogaku Coating Engineering , published b Asakura Shoten, March 20, 1971, pp. 253 277. The magnetic layer thus formed on the base is dried after the ferromagnetic particles in the layer optionally oriented in magnetic field. If necessary, the web with the magnetic layer may be slit into a shape desired for the final magnetic recording mediur . For the magnetic orientation, an A.C. or D.C. magnetic field having about 500 to 3,000 Gauss is preferred.The web is subsequently dried preferably at a temperature between about 50 and 100 CC for a period of about 3 to 10 minutes. Other methods suitable for use in the present invention to orient the ferromagnetic particles magnetically are found in various patents such as U.S.Patents Nos. 1,949,840, 2,796,359, 3,001,891, 3,172,776, 3,416,949, 3,473,960, and 3,681,138 Japanese PatentPublications Nos. 3427 57, 28368 64, 23624 65, 23625 65, 13181 66, 13043 73 and 39722 73. All of the magnetic recording media prepared by the above described method of the present invention had much greater resistance to wear and longer stability than the conventional product. They also had far better S N ratios and greater reproduction output than the conventional product. This shows the adaptability to highdensity recording of the magnetic recording medium of the present invention. The present invention is hereunder described in greater detail by reference to working examples which are given here for illustrative purposes only. It will be readily understood by those skilled in the art that the compositions of magnetic recording media and the sequence of the steps of preparing the latter may be modified in various manners without departing from the spirit of the present invention. Therefore, the scope of the present invention should not be limited to any of the following examples.

The data in Table 6 shows that the video tape samples prepared according to the present invention were suitable for high density recording because they had good wear resistance and long term stability e.g.absence of stickiness , exhibited high S N ratios and produced high reproduction output as compared with the conventional product. Tape samples Nos. 1 to 24 were those of video tape, but the present inventors confirmed that similar advantages were obtained when audio tape samples were prepared using the surfacetreated ferromagnetic particles according to the present invention. The magnetic paint compositions used in preparing the tape samples Nos. 1 to 24 and those used in preparing comparative samples Nos. 1 to 5 were spread with an applicator onto glass plates to form magnetic layers having a wet thickness of 60 microns. Under observation with an electron microscope, the magnetic layers prepared from the comparative magnetic paints contained much more agglomerates of ferromagnetic particles than those used in preparing samples Nos. 1 to 24 according to the present invention, and this shows the high uniformity of the ferromagnetic particles dispersed in these magnetic paints.

The data in Table 9 shows that the video tape samples prepared according to the present invention were suitable for high density recording because they had good wear resistance and long term stability e.g. absence of stickiness , exhibited high S N ratios and produced high reproduction output as compared with the conventional product. Tape samplesNo. 32 to No. 43 were those of video tape, but the present inventors confirmed that similar advantages were obtained when audio tape samples were prepared using the dispersions of surface treated ferromagnetic particles according to the present invention. EXAMPLE 44 The magnetic paint compositions used in preparing the tape samples Nos. 32 to 43 and those used in preparing comparative samples Nos. 6 to 10 were spread with an applicator onto glass plates to form magnetic layers having a wet thickness of 60 microns. Under observations with an electron microscope, the magnetic layers prepared from the comparative magnetic paints contained much more agglomerates of ferromagnetic particles than those used in preparing samples Nos. 32 to 43 according to the present invention. This shows the high uniformity of the ferromagnetic particles dispersed in these magnetic paints. EXAMPLE 45 A hundred parts of Co containing Fe304 particles J was dispersed in 1,000 parts of 1 x 10 4 N aqueous solution of AlCl3 as in Example 1. After adding 300 parts of a 2 toluene solution of sodium eicosylbenzenesulfonate, the resulting mixture was well stirred to form a uniform dispersion. Upon standing, the dispersion separated into aqueous and organic toluene layers. The aqueous layer was removed and 50 parts of a molecular sieve was added to the remaining toluene layer. After agitating the mixture, the molecular sieve was filtered off to leave a toluene dispersion of the surface treated ferromagnetic particles this was referred to as dispersion sample No. 46 . EXAMPLE 46 A toluene dispersion of surface treated ferromagnetic particles was prepared from the following formulation as in Example 45. Amounts Components in parts Co containing Fe304 particles 100 Aqueous NaOH solution ca. 1 x 10 4 N 1,000 N cetyl N ethyl morpholinium ethosulfate 300 as 2 toluene solution The resulting dispersion was referred to as dispersion sample No. 46.

COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 11 A hundred parts of Co containing Fe304 particles was dispersed in 1,000 parts of a toluene solution containing 5 parts of lecithin. The resulting dispersion was referred to as comparative dispersion sample No. 11. COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 12 A hundred parts of Fe particles was dispersed in 1,000 parts of a toluene solution containing 5 parts of lecithin. The resulting dispersion was referred to as comparative dispersion sample No. 12. COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 13 A hundred parts of non treated Co containing Foe304 particles was dispersed in 1,000 parts of toluene, and the resulting dispersion was referred to as comparative dispersion sample No. 13. COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 14 A hundred parts of non treated Fe particles was dispersed in 1,000 parts of toluene, and the resulting product was referred to as comparative dispersion sample No. 14. The dispersibility of the ferromagnetic particles in dispersion samples Nos. 45 to 47 was compared with that of the particles in comparative dispersion samples Nos. 11 to 14 by measuring their sedimentation velocity. The results are shown in Table 10. Table 10 Sedimentation velocity mm 24 hr.
