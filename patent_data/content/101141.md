# PROCESS FOR MANUFACTURING LOW MOLECULAR WEIGHT HEPARINS BY DEPOLYMERIZATION OF NORMAL HEPARIN

## Abstract
Process for manufacturing low molecular weight hepar in fractions from normal heparin wherein such fractions have better pharmacological and therapeutic properties than the normal heparin. The process comprises the steps of, a acififying normal heparin to obtain heparinic acid with a pH in the range of about 3 to about 5, and b depolymerizing the heparinic acid by heating in the presence of an oxidizing agent to obtain low molecular weight heparin fractions in the range of about 4,000 Dalton to about 12,000 Dalton.
