# Laminates of cloth or other sheet material and filled crystalline polypropylenes and a method for making them.

## Abstract
Laminates comprising cloth 17 or other sheet material bonded to a filled crystalline polypropylone composition 14 by means of an unfilled crystalline polypropylene composi tion 15 , preferably a crystalline random copolymer of prop ylene and 0.5 to 5.0 of ethylene. The laminates are made by sandwiching preferably a sheet 15 of the unfilled composi tion between the cloth 17 and filled composition 14 and then heating the sandwich to above the crystalline melting points of the polypropyienes and subsequently cooling to form the laminate. The fillers may be minerals or wood flour, the cloths may be knitted, woven or feted and other sheet materials may be plastics films, metal foils, paper or leather cloth.
