# Radiation image recording apparatus.

## Abstract
A radiation image recording apparatus for recording a radiation image of an object at a variable height comprises a delivery stationary transfer mechanism 2a and a receiving stationary transfer mechanism 2b fixedly provided spaced from each other. A recording table unit 16 which is movable back and forth between the stationary transfer mechanisms 2a, 2b and is provided with a receiving transfer mechanism 6a for introducing a recording medium sheet into the recording table unit 16 and a delivery transfer mechanism 6b for discharging the recording medium sheet from the recording table unit 16 . At least a pair of relay transfer mechanisms 8a, 8b which are movable in the direction of movement of the recording table unit 16 integrally with each other, one 8a between the delivery stationary transfer mechanism 2a and the receiving transfer mechanism 6a , and the other 8b between the receiving stationary transfer mechanism 2b and the delivery transfer mechanism 6b . The relay transfer mechanisms 8a, 8b are movable within a range in which the spaces between the delivery stationary transfer mechanism 2a and said one relay transfer mechan ism 8a , between the receiving transfer mechanism 6a and said one relay transfer mechanism 8a , between the delivery otransfer mechanism 6b and said the other relay transfer mechanism 8b and between the receiving stationary trans fer mechanism 2b and said the other relay transfer mechanism 8b are not larger than the length of the recording medium sheet.
