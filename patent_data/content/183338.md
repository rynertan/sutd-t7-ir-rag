# MOTION TRANSMITTING REMOTE CONTROL ASSEMBLY INITIAL REDUCED RESISTANCE SELF AJUST

## Abstract
A motion transmitting remote control assembly 10 of the type for transmitting forces along a curved path by a flexible motion transmitting core element 16 movably supported in a flexible conduit 12 . The assembly includes a support member 22 adapted to be connected to a support structure 24 such as a bulkhead and the conduit 12 includes a slider member 32 slidably disposed in a 20 passageway extending longitudinally through the support member. The support member includes a transverse guide way 36 in which is disposed a metal L shaped latch member 38 having an aperture in one leg through which the slider member extends. The bottom of the aperture in the latch member has a tooth 48 which coacts with ratcheting teeth 46, 47 on the slider member. A coil spring 44 urges the tooth of the latch member into engagement with the ratcheting teeth of the slider member. A temperature responsive slug 50 is disposed in parallel with the coil spring. The assembly is characterized by the ratcheting teeth 36, 37 on the slider member being of two different ramp slopes to provide an initial reduced resistance to longitudinal movement of the slider member 32 through the support member 22 .
