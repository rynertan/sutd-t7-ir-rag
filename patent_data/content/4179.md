# Tubular scaffolding coupling.

## Abstract
A coupling for tubular scaffolding includes a boss 10 mounted on a standard 40 by a pin 42 or by welding and a wedge ring 24 rotatably encircling and co planar with the boss. Radial insets 16 in the boss combine with the ring to form apertures 30 in which pegs 32 are locatable, the pegs being attached to the ends of ledgers 80 and transoms 82. The inner face of the wedge ring has sloping wedge surfaces 28 in the vicinity of the apertures 30 which alter the radial dimension of the apertures. Thus, when a peg is located in an aperture the wedge ring can be rotated to wedge the peg firmly in the aperture. The problem existing prior to the invention was the difficulty of securing ledgers and transoms. This had to be done by screw couplings or by getting above the coupling in order to tighten it. The coupling of the invention can be operated from below, i.e. by a person standing on erected scaffolding.
