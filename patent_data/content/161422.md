# Alkanolamine derivatives and platelet aggregation inhibitors containing the same as an active ingredient.

## Abstract
Alkanolamine derivatives and platelet aggregation in hibitors containing the same as an active ingredient are disclosed. The alkanolamine derivatives are novel com pounds which possess potent platelet aggregation inhibit ory activities and effective in preventing diseases such as thrombosis. As typical compounds are mentioned N 5,8,11,14,17 eicosapentaenoyl 2 aminoethanol, N nicotinoyl 2 aminoethyl 5,8,11,14,17 eicosapentaenoate, N ethyl N 5,8,11,14,17 eicosapentaenoyl 2 aminoethanol, N butyl N 5,8,11,14,17 eicosapentaenoyl 2 aminoethanol, N 5,8,11,14,17 3 aminopropylnicotinate, N ethyl N nicotinoyl 2 aminoethyl 5,8,11,14,17 eicosapentaenoate and the like.
