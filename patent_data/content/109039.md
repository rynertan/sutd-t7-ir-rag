Rats were divided into groups having about equal blood pressure level. The test compounds were suspended in 0. ss methyl cellulose solution and were orally administered. Five hours later, systolic blood pressure was measured again. Rats were put in restrainers and then warmed at 40 C in a heating chamber. The blood pressure was measured by a tail cuff method NARCO, PE 300 . In addition tail arterial pulse wave was conducted to a tachometer, and the heart rate was measured. The antibypertensive activity is shown as decrease mmHg against the initial blood pressure mean value of each group of sir animals , and the heart rate is shown as the absolute value obtained by the measurement.
