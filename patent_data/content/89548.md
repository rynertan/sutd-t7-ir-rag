# Osmotic drug delivery system.

## Abstract
An osmotic drug or other beneficial substance delivery system comprises a compartment with one or more cham bers 2,6 formed by an external shell 2 and one or more chamber dividing walls 3 of a microporous material each with an optional small orifice 4 , and overlayers 1 of semipermeable membranes completely covering the outer shell of all but one chamber and substantially covering the outer shell of the remaining chamber. Osmotic agents, adjuvants, enzymes, drugs, pro drugs, pesticides and the like are incorporated in the chambers covered by the semiperme able membrane, and external fluids that diffuse into those chambers form solutions and by osmotic pressure are forced through the microporous chamber dividing wall or orifice, to the drug chamber to form a solution thereof and then through the exposed microporous shell to the exterior of the device at a rate controlled by the permeability of the semipermeable overlay and the osmotic pressure gradient across the shell.
