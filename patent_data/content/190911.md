## Description
The present invention relates to apparatus for controlling a field or frame store signal processor in the presence of nonstandard video signals. Field and frame store memories may be used in such video signal processing systems as comb filters, progressive scan systems and temporal noise reduction systems. In each of these systems, samples that are separated by a field or frame time are combined to produce processed samples. These systems are generally designed to operate on signals that are well correlated from field to field or from frame to frame. When video signals are not well correlated because of interfield motion or because the signals are produced by a nonstandard source, the performance of the field or frame memory signal processor may be degraded. It is desirable to at least partially defeat the field or frame processing when a lack of correlation is detected to minimize degredation of the reproduced image. For example, many frame memory signal processing systems include motion detectors which modify or circumvent the frame memory processing steps for portions of the image that display moving objects. As set forth above, signals from nonstandard sources, or nonstandard signals, may be poorly correlated from field to field or frame to frame. As used in this application, the term nonstandard signal means a color video signal in which the ratio of the chrominance subcarrier frequency, f Sample misalignment from a field to field or from frame to frame may be a problem for other types of field or frame memory signal processors as well. For example, when the average ratio of f Misalignment problems can occur, however, even when the average ratio of f Nonstandard signal detectors exist which will discriminate between broadcast and cable television signals, which conform closely to the standard, and nonstandard video game or personal computer signals. Many of these detectors, however, may not be able to detect nonstandard signals from VTR s and video disk players. U.S. Patent US A 4,335,403 entitled Horizontal Countdown System For Television Receivers discloses one type of nonstandard signal detector. This detector compares a processed sync pulse , having a 280 ns pulse width with a flyback center pulse having a 560 ns pulse width. Assuming that a 70 ns overlap is needed to detect coincidence, this system allows signals which may deviate from the standard by as many as six 70 ns samples in a horizontal line to pass as standard signals. These signals could seriously degrade the performance of a field or frame signal processor. Another nonstandard signal detector is described in U.S. Patent US A 4,454,531 entitled Digital Circuit For Providing A Binary Signal On The Occurrence Of A Predetermined Frequency Ratio Of Two Signals . The detector described in this reference uses a counter to derive a horizontal line frequency pulse from a sampling clock signal which is fixed in frequency relative to the color subcarrier frequency. A monostable multivibrator, or one shot, stretches these horizontal frequency pulses to be at least two clock periods wide. The stretched pulses are applied to the up down input of a second counter and horizontal sync pulses, derived from the input signal, are applied to the clock input of the second counter. The second counter counts up for any horizontal sync pulse which falls within the window defined by the stretched horizontal line frequency pulse i.e. for standard signals and counts down for horizontal sync pulses which do not fall within this window i.e. for nonstandard signals . If the value held by the second counter at the end of a field is above a predetermined threshold, the signals which generated the field are presumed to be standard and the value held by a third counter is incremented. If, however, the value held by the second counter at the end of a field falls below this threshold, the value held by the third counter is set to zero. When the value in the third counter reaches approximately 1000, the output signal of the detector changes to indicate that standard signals are being processed. The 1000 field delay may make this detector unsuitable for use with a field or frame memory. A temporary loss of coincidence in an otherwise standard signals due to a change between two cameras, for example, may cause the detector to disable the field or frame memory processing, reducing the quality of the displayed image. In the NTSC system, the 1000 field delay would cause the low quality image to be displayed for 13 seconds before field or frame memory signal processing would be allowed to resume. JP A 59 23987 discloses a video signal processing system including a source of composite video signals which include line synchronizing and field synchronizing components. The system comprises furthermore a nonstandard signal detector coupled to said source for developing a control signal which is in a first state when said line synchronizing component has a frequency which substantially conforms to a frequency determined by a ratio between line frequency and color subcarrier signal frequency sampling clock which is chosen to be four times the frequency of the colour subcarrier established for a predetermined video standard and which is in a second state otherwise and a multi mode video signal processor having first and second operating modes wherein during the first operating mode, YC separation is performed by a comb line filter and during the second operating mode YC separation is performed by a band pass filter. According to the present invention, there is provided a video signal processing system including a source of composite video signals which include line synchronizing and field synchronizing components, said system comprising a nonstandard signal detector coupled to said source for developing a control signal which is in a first state when said line synchronizing component has a frequency which substantially conforms to a frequency determined by a ratio between line frequency and color subcarrier signal frequency established for a predetermined video signal standard and which is in a second state otherwise a multi mode video signal processor having first and second operating modes and means responsive to said control signal, for determining the mode of operation of said multi mode video signal processor characterized in that said processor includes memory means coupled to said source for storing at least one field of said composite video signal and said processor, during operation in said first operating mode, effects a combination of signals from said source with stored prior field signals from said memory means to produce processed video signals and said non standard signal detector includes means for developing an indicating signal which changes from one state to another state substantially coincident with changes of said control signal from said first state to said second state, and which changes from said other state to said one state after said control signal has been in said first state for an integral number of periods of said vertical field synchronizing signal wherein said integral number of periods corresponds to the number of such periods required to fill said memory means and said signal processor operates in said first operating mode when said indicating signal exhibits a said one state, and operates in said second operating mode when said indicating signal exhibits said other state. For a better understanding of the present invention reference will now be made by way of example to the drawings, in which In the drawings, broad arrows represent busses for multiple bit parallel digital signals. Line arrows represent corrections carrying analog signals or single bit digital signals. Depending on the processing speed of the devices, compensating delays may be required in certain of the signal paths. One skilled in the art of digital circuit design would know where such delays would be needed in his particular system. In FIGURE 1, a source of composite video signals 10, which may include the tuner, intermediate frequency amplifier and video detector of a conventional color television receiver, provides analog composite video signals to sync separator circuit 16. The sync separator 16 generates horizontal and vertical synchronization pulses and burst gate pulses from the analog composite video signals by conventional means. The horizontal synchronization pulses are applied to the horizontal phase locked loop PLL 20. PLL 20 produces a signal which is phase locked to the horizontal synchronization pulses from sync separator 16. Ideally, PLL 20 has a relatively wide lock in range so that it may respond quickly to phase shifts in the horizontal synchronization pulses derived from the composite video signals. A suitable horizontal phase locked loop may be built from conventional components, such as the RCA CD4046A integrated circuit. The primary function of PLL 20 is to provide relatively noise free horizontal synchronization signals. In systems where noise immunity is not an important design consideration, the PLL 20 may be removed. The phase locked horizontal line frequency pulses from PLL 20 are applied to pulse forming circuitry which includes AND gate 19, delay element 21 and inverter 23. The output terminal of PLL 20 is connected to delay element 21 and to one input terminal of AND gate 19. Delay element 21 provides delayed pulses to inverter 23, the output terminal of which is connected to the second input terminal of AND gate 19. The pulses provided by AND gate 19 start at substantially the same time as the pulses from PLL 20 but have a pulse width approximately equal to the delay provided by delay element 21. In the present embodiment, this delay is less than 140 ns so that the signal HS, provided by AND gate 19, is a horizontal line frequency pulse signal that is phase locked to the horizontal sync component of the received composite video signal and that has a relatively narrow pulse width i.e. less than two periods of the 4f The vertical synchronization pulses from sync separator 16 are applied to a conventional vertical frequency PLL 18 which produces a vertical synchronization signal, VS. Signal VS is locked in frequency and phase to the vertical synchronization pulses derived from the composite video signals by sync separator 16. The burst gate signal, BG, is applied by sync separator 16 to a PLL 14 which produces a sampling clock signal that has a frequency four times the frequency of the color subcarrier signal and that is phase locked to the color synchronizing burst component of the composite video signals. PLL 14 may be a conventional digitally controlled PLL similar to the one disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,291,332 entitled Phase Locked Circuit . The 4f The horizontal and vertical synchronization signals, HS and VS and the 4f FIGURE 2 is a block diagram showing details of nonstandard signal detector 22. In this figure, the 4f When the counter 210 counts down to zero, it produces a logic high output signal. This signal is applied to the preset enable input terminal PE of the counter 210. The logic high signal applied to terminal PE sets the counter to the value applied to its preset input port synchronous with the leading edge of the next 4f The pulses from counter 210 are applied to one input terminal of AND gate 214. The horizontal sync signal, HS, from the AND gate 19 is applied to the other input terminal of AND gate 214. AND gate 214 is a coincidence detector. It produces an output pulse when the horizontal pulses from PLL 20 and from counter 210 overlap in time. This coincidence pulse is applied to the trigger input terminal, T, of horizontal retriggerable one shot 216. One shot 216 converts a coincidence pulse applied to its trigger input terminal into an output pulse that is a predetermined number of horizontal line periods wide. One shot 216 is retriggerable, so that, once triggered, each subsequent coincidence pulse extends the output pulse of the one shot by the predetermined number of horizontal line periods. In the present embodiment, the output pulses provided by one shot 216 are 25 horizontal line periods wide. Consequently, the output of the one shot 216 maintains a logic high state if a coincidence is detected at least once in each 25 horizontal line intervals. This signal has been found to be a good indicator of standard or nonstandard signals it is in a logic high state when the ratio between f The output signal from one shot 216 is inverted by inverter 218 and applied to the reset input terminals of the frequency divider 220 and the set reset flip flop 222. The vertical sync signal VS from PLL 18 is applied to the signal input terminal of frequency divider 220. Frequency divider 220, which frequency divides the field rate vertical sync signal by four, develops a signal that has a two frame period and a 50 duty cycle. The output signal from frequency divider 220 is applied to the set input terminal of flip flop 222. When standard signals are being processed, the reset input signals to frequency divider 220 and flip flop 222 are both in a logic low state and, after at least two fields of standard signal have been processed by the frequency divider 220, the set input signal to the flip flop 222 is in a logic high state. Consequently, the signal provided by flip flop 222 is in a logic high state. When a nonstandard signal is detected, however, inverter 218 applies a logic high signal to the reset inputs of the frequency divider 220 and the flip flop 222. This signal resets the frequency divider, changing the signal applied to the set input of the flip flop 222 and the signal provided by the flip flop to logic low signals. When the output signal from inverter 218 again changes to a logic low state, indicating that standard signals are being processed, the output signal from flip flop 222 remains in a logic low state for one frame time. This delay allows the frame memory signal processing circuitry to store one frame of standard signals before frame processing is resumed. As stated above, programmable down counter 210 may be preset to count down from one of two values. The six most significant bits of each of these values are supplied by source 212. The two least significant bits are supplied by inverter 218 and one shot 216. In the present embodiment, the value provided by source 212 is E3‚ÇÅ‚ÇÜ 227‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ the subscripts 16 and 10 indicate hexadecimal and decimal notation respectively . When the two least significant bits are concatenated to this six bit value, preset values of 38D‚ÇÅ‚ÇÜ 909‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ and 38E‚ÇÅ‚ÇÜ 910‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ are obtained, corresponding to the output signal of the one shot being in a logic high and a logic low state respectively. When the counter 210 is preset to 909, one pulse is emitted by the counter for every 910 pulses of the 4f When the counter 210 is preset to 910, the counter cycles every 911 clock pulses and the signal provided by the counter 210 has a frequency slightly less than f As described above, one shot 216 may be a conventional monostable multivibrator, having a pulse width time constant determined by a resistor capacitor RC network. FIGURE 3 shows an alternative implementation of the one shot 216 which does not need an RC network. Horizontal sync pulses from PLL 20 are applied to the one shot 216 as shown in phantom in FIGURE 2. These horizontal sync pulses are applied to one input terminal of AND gate 310. The output signal of the AND gate 310 is applied to the count input terminal, C, of counter 312. The output terminal of counter 312 is connected to the input terminal of inverter 314 which provides the output signal of the one shot. This output signal is applied to the second input terminal of AND gate 310. The trigger input terminal of the digital one shot is the reset input terminal, R, of the counter 312. When the output signal of the counter is in a logic high state i.e. when the counter has counted to its maximum value , the output of inverter 314 is in a logic low state. The logic low signal from inverter 314 disables AND gate 310, so horizontal sync pulses are not applied to the count input terminal of the counter 312. When a pulse is applied to the reset terminal of counter 312, however, the output signal of the counter changes to a logic low state, and the inverter 314 applies a logic high signal to enable AND gate 310 to pass horizontal sync pulses. Counter 312 counts these pulses until it reaches its maximum value and once again disables the AND gate. In the present embodiment, the maximum value of the counter 312 is 25. Referring again to FIGURE 1, the nonstandard signal detector 22 applies its output signal to field or frame memory processor 24. Processor 24 may, for example, include a comb filter, a recursive noise reducing filter or an interlaced scan to progressive scan conversion systems. Processor 24 processes the digitized composite video samples applied to it by ADC 12. In this embodiment of the invention, processor 24 provides separated luminance and chrominance signals, Y and C respectively to luminance chrominance signal processor 26. Processor 26 may include circuitry to demodulate the C signal into color difference signals and circuitry to combine the color difference signals with the luminance signal to produce the primary color signals R, G and B. These primary color signals may be used to drive a display device not shown . FIGURE 4A is a block diagram of an adaptive frame comb filter which illustratively may be used to implement the function of processor 24 of FIG. 1. Composite video samples are simultaneously applied to a conventional frame comb filter 410 and to a conventional line comb filter 412. The luminance signals from the frame comb filter 410 and from the line comb filter 412 are applied to separate data input ports of multiplexer 414. Similarly, the chrominance signals from filters 410 and 412 are applied to separate data input ports of multiplexer 416. The signal provided by nonstandard signal detector 22 is applied to the control input terminals of multiplexers 414 and 416. Each of the multiplexers 414 and 416 is configured to pass the signal from the frame comb when the control signal is in a logic high state and to pass the signal from the line comb when the control signal is in a logic low state. As stated above, the control signal changes to a logic high state only after one frame of standard signals has been received. This allows the frame comb filter 410 to accumulate one frame of standard samples before frame memory processing is resumed. FIGURE 4B is a block diagram of a recursive noise reducing filter illustrative of alternative apparatus for implementing the function of signal processor 24 of FIGURE 1. Composite video samples are applied to sample scaler 452 by ADC 12. Scaler 452 multiplies each of the samples by a scale factor K and applies the scaled samples to one input port of adder 454. Adder 454 adds these scaled samples to corresponding samples from frame store 458 that have been scaled by a factor of 1 K in sample scaler 460. The samples developed by adder 454 are applied to one data input port of multiplexer 450. Composite video samples from ADC 12 via delay element 448 are applied to the other data input terminal of multiplexer 450. Delay element 448 provides compensating delay substantially equal to the processing time through sample scaler 452 and adder 454. The control signal applied to multiplexer 450 is the output signal provided by nonstandard signal detector 22. When this signal is in a logic high state, the multiplexer 450 applies the samples from adder 454 to the input port of Y C separating filter 462. When the signal from detector 22 is in a logic low state, the multiplexer 450 applies the samples from delay element 448 to filter 462. Y C separating filter 462 may extract the luminance and chrominance components from the composite video samples by conventional means providing a luminance signal Y and a chrominance signal C to luminance chrominance processor 26. Composite video samples from the multiplexer 450 are also applied to the input port of chroma inverter 456. The chroma inverter 456 inverts the chrominance components of these samples. The composite video samples provided by chroma inverter 456 are applied to the frame store 458. Frame store 458 may be a conventional shift register type frame memory. In an NTSC signal processing system, this memory may have 477,750 pixel storage locations. Samples delayed by one frame time relative to the samples from ADC 12 are applied to the input port of sample scaler 460 by frame store 458. Sample scaler 460 multiplies these samples by a factor of 1 K. These scaled samples are added to the samples provided by sample scaler 452. The chrominance signal phases of the samples from scalers 452 and 460 are the same because the chroma inverter 456 reverses the phase of the frame delayed samples before applying them to the frame store. Sample scalers 452 and 460, adder 454, chroma inverter 456 and frame store 458 constitute a conventional one frame recursive noise reducing filter. A more detailed description of this filter can be found in the article by McMann et al. entitled A Digital Noise Reducer For Encoded NTSC Signals , FIGURE 4C is a block diagram of an adaptive interlace scan to progressive scan conversion system which uses a field store memory, providing an additional example of apparatus suitable for implementing the function of processor 24 of FIG. 1. An interlace scan to progressive scan conversion system may be used, for example, in a television receiver to reduce the loss of vertical resolution and frame rate flicker artifacts of an interlaced scan signal. Systems which display a progressive scan image double the number of lines in each field and the rate at which the lines processed to display a full image frame during each field period. Two types of progressive scan systems that are known in the art are field progressive scan systems and line progressive scan systems. A typical field progressive scan system is described in U.S. Patent 4,426,661 entitled Television Receiver Including A Circuit For Doubling Line Scanning Frequency which is hereby incorporated by reference. In this system, composite video signals are delayed one field time and applied along with undelayed signals to a speed up circuit. The speed up circuit doubles the scan rate of each of the signals and inserts the field delayed lines in between the undelayed lines. This signal is displayed at twice the rate of the interlaced signal to provide a progressive scan image. U.S. Patent 4,415,931 entitled Television Display With Doubled Horizontal Lines , hereby incorporated by reference, describes a line progressive scan system. In this system, each line of each field is displayed twice in a single field time. This system increases the number of lines in each field but may not provide the same vertical resolution as a field progressive scan system. However, a line progressive scan system may produce a better image than a field progressive scan system when nonstandard signals are being processed. The field to field correlation errors which may occur in nonstandard signals may cause a field progressive scan system to display a jagged image while causing almost no distortion in a line progressive scan system. In FIGURE 4C, composite video signals from ADC 12 are applied to both the field progressive scan system 470 and to the line progressive scan system 472. The double rate signals provided by systems 470 and 472 are applied to the two data input ports of multiplexer 474. The control signal input terminal, of multiplexer 474 is coupled to nonstandard signal detector 22. Multiplexer 474 is configured to pass the double rate signal from the field progressive scan system 470 when the control signal from detector 22 is in a logic high state and to pass the signal from the line progressive scan system 472 otherwise. The signal provided by multiplexer 474 is applied to Y C separation filter 476, which may separate the luminance and chrominance components from the composite video samples by conventional means to provide a luminance signal, Y, and a chrominance signal, C, to luminance chrominance processor 26. Although an illustrative embodiment of the invention has been shown in a digital color television signal processing system including a field or frame memory processor, it is contemplated that the invention may also be practiced in an analog system which uses a charge coupled device CCD or delay line field or frame store memory. It is also contemplated that the invention may be used in systems which store frames or fields of processed video signals as well as in systems which store composite video signals.
