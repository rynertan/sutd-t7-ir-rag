Generally, 6 to 7 membered rings are pre ferred,with a 6 membered ring, preferably piperidyl, being especially preferred. If the ring is substituted, it is generally preferred that the ring be substituted at one or two positions with a lower alkyl group, preferably methyl or ethyl.The ringEMI3.1 can contain additional nitrogen hetero atoms. Preferably, this ring system contains only two nitrogen atoms and from 5 to 6 members. However, ring systems containing 3 nitrogen atoms can be used in the penicillanic acid derivative of this invention. The carbon atoms other than the carbon atom separating the two nitrogen atoms in the ring can be unsubstituted or substituted with a lower alkyl group, preferably methyl or ethyl. The carbon atom separating the two nitrogen atoms in the ring can be substituted with any substituent designated by R.This ring system contains a double bond between the carbon separating the two nitrogen atoms in the ring and one of these nitrogen atoms. In addition, this ring system can contain no other double bonds or can contain one or two additional double bonds. Among the preferred ring systems are EMI3.2 where R8 and Rg are hydrogen or lower alkyl, preferably methyl or ethyl and R is as above.The ringEMI3.3 preferably contains five or six members. This ring can contain only one double bond or can be completely unsaturated, i.e. aromatic. The preferred rings are EMI4.1 When R4 in the compound of formula I is an amino protecting group, any conventional amino protecting group can be utilized in the compounds of this invention, an amino protecting group which can be removed by conventional acid hydrolysis or catalytic hydrogenation being preferred. Among the preferred amino protecting groups are included trityl,benzyloxycarbonyl, o nitrophenylsulphenyl, t butoxycarbonyl, benzyl, diphenylmethyl. The salts of the compounds of the invention are in addition to their inner salts zwitterions mono or dibasic salts, formed with non toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable acids. Among these acids are included hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid, p toluenesulphonic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, maleic acid. In addition to these acids, any conventional pharmaceutically acceptable, non toxic inorganic or organic acids can be used to form the salts of the compounds of formulaeI and II. These salts can be prepared by treating the compounds of formulae I and II with the aforementioned acids by conventional means well known in the art. Also included in the invention are salts with pharmaceutically acceptable, non toxic, inorganic or organic bases, e.g. alkali metal salts and alkaline earth metal salts, for example sodium, potassium, magnesium or calcium salts, as well as salts with ammonia or suitable non toxic amines, such as lower alkylamines, for example triethylamine hydroxy lower alkylamines, for example 2 hydroxyethylamine, bis 2 hydroxyethyl amine or tris 2 hydroxy ethyl amine cycloalkylamines, for example dicyclohexyl amine or benzylamines, for example N,N dibenzyl ethylenediamine and dibenzylamine. Thus for instance other antibiotics with acid or basic character can be used as components of such salts of the compounds of formulae I and II. The salts can also be hydrated either during manufacture or by gradual hydration of an initially anhydrous salt due to the hydroscopic properties of the compounds of formulae I and II. The hydrolyzable, pharmaceutically acceptable esters of the compounds of formulae I and II are the well known types of easily hydrolyzable esters, e.g. lower alkanoyl esters, acyloxyalkyl esters, such as lower alkanoyloxyalkyl esters, e.g. acetoxymethyl and pivaloyloxymethyl esters and the corresponding 1 acetoxyethyl and 1 pivaloyloxyethyl esters, alkoxycarbonyloxyalkyl esters, e.g.methoxycarbonylmethyl and 1 ethoxycarbonyl oxyethyl esters, lactonyl esters, e.g. phthalidyl esters, or lower alkoxymethyl and acylaminomethyl esters. Other acyloxyalkyl esters are within the scope of the invention, e.g. such esters in which the acyl group is a radical derived from a beta lactam antibiotic, such as a penicillin, cephalosporin, an amidinopenicillanic acid or clavulanic acid, which esters when hydrolyzed in the host may give rise to enhanced effect. Also other esters can be useful, e.g. the benzyl ester and the cyanomethyl ester. Appropriately the esters above can be prepared and used in the form of their salts with pharmaceutically acceptable, non toxic inorganic or organic acids or bases. A series of substituted 6 beta amidinopenicillanic acids, their salts and easily hydrolyzable esters are disclosed in the British Pat. No. 1,293,590 and other easily hydrolyzable esters of the compounds of British Pat,No. 1,293,590 have been disclosed in the British Pat. Nos.1,335,718 and 1,405,886. Among the pharmaceutically acceptable, non toxic esters of the amidopenicillanic acid derivatives of formulae I andII are included the diesters of the formula EMI6.1 wherein R19 is the acyl radical of one of the com pounds of formulae I and II R10 is the acyl radical of one of the compounds of formulae I and II or an acyl radical of another known beta lactam antibiotic and R11 is hydrogen, lower alkyl, or phenyl, or salts of such esters with pharmaceutically acceptable non toxic acids or bases. The compounds of formulae I and II, their salts and their hydrolyzable esters are effective in the treatment of infectious disorders caused by gram positive and gram negative bacterial microorganisms such as K. pneumoniae,E. coli, E. cloacae, P. aeruginosa, P. vulgaris andS. marcescens. It is also an object of the present invention to provide an antibacterial pharmaceutical composition for use in the treatment of infectious diseases, which contains as an active ingredient a 6 aminopenicillanic acid derivative of the formulae I, II, or III given hereinbefore. For parenteral and topical use, the compounds of formulae I, II and III or their salts are preferred. These can also in some cases be used orally. However, for oral use it is in most cases advantageous to use an easily hydrolyzable ester of the compounds, because such esters are generally better absorbed than the corresponding acids or salts. The esters have no antibacterial activity per se, but they are during or after the absorption hydrolyzed to liberate the corresponding free acids. The active ingredient can be used as such or can be mixed up with a carrier and or an auxiliary agent. In such compositions, the proportion of therapeutically active material to carrier substance and auxiliary agent can vary between 1 and 95 by weight. The compositions can either be in any conventional pharmaceutical form such as tablets, pills or dragees, or can be filled in medical containers such as capsules, or as far as suspensions are concerned filled into bottles. Pharmaceutical organic or inorganic solid or liquid carriers suitable for enteral, parenteral or topical administration can be used to make up the composition. Gelatine, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, talc, vegetable and animal fats and oils, gum, polyalkylene glycol, or other known carriers for medicaments may all be suitable as carriers. In the pharmaceutical compositions, the compounds of the invention can be used together with other suitable therapeutically active components, preferably with other antibacterially active compounds, such as beta lactam antibiotics, e.g. penicillins or other aminopenicillanic acid derivatives, and cephalosporins. Also other antibacterially active substances are of interest in this connection, e.g. aminoglycosides. In combinations with beta lactam antibiotics, such as penicillins like ampicillin, amoxicillin, or carbenicillin, or cephalosporins like cephalothin, cefazolin or cephalexin, a synergistic effect is observed which is of importance in many clinical situations. Also a depression of development of resistance can be obtained by a combination therapy.In such compositions, the weight ratio between the active components appropriately is between 1 20 and 20 1, preferably within the ratio 1 5 and 5 1. These active components may be administered together or the compounds of this invention may be administered before of after the administration of another beta lactam antibiotic. The compounds of the invention can also be used together with a beta lactamase inhibitor, such as clavulanic. acid. Another object of the invention resides in the selection of a dose for the compounds of the invention which can be administered so that the desired activity is achieved without simultaneous secondary effects. The compounds of this invention alone or in combination with other beta lactam antibiotics can be conveniently administered orally in dosage units amounts corresponding to from 0.025 g to 2.5 g of these compounds, preferably from 0.05 to 1.5 g depending on which microorganisms are involved. By the term dosage unit is meant a unitary, e.g. a single dose capable of being administered to a patient, and which may be readily handled and packed, remaining as a physically stable unit dose, comprising either the active material as such or a mixture of it with a pharmaceutical carrier. Generally, the oral dosage units are administered in accordance with the patient s needs, preferably from 2 to 8 times a day and most preferably from 2 to 6 times a day. Similarly, for infusion, the compounds of the invention are given in doses up to 10 mg in aqueous solution. For parenteral use, e.g. injections, the compounds of the invention alone or in combination with other betalactam antibiotics are given e.g. in an aqueous solution or suspension as a dosage unit containing from 0.1 to 2.5 g of these active compounds to be dissolved or suspended immediately before use, or ready for use together with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle. In the form of a dosage unit these active compounds may be administered once or more times a day at appropriate intervals, always depending, however, on the condition of the patient. As used herein the term patient includes animals as well as humans. Thus, a daily dose will preferably amount to from 0.2 g to 20 g of the compounds of the invention alone or together with other beta lactam antibiotics with daily amounts of from 1 to 12 grams parenterally administered being especially preferred. The compounds of the invention are appropriately administered in the form of their pharmaceutically acceptable, non toxic, easily hydrolyzable esters. The compounds of formulae I and II and their salts, esters and hydrates when administered together or in combination with other beta lactam antibiotics such as cephalosporins and penicillins exhibit enhanced antibacterial properties due to this combination. In general, effects are achieved through the use of these combinations. In preparing a dosage unit for oral, topical or parenteral use, the weight ratio between the active ingredients in a combination can vary between 1 to 20 parts of an antibiotic of formulae I or II and from 20 to 1 parts of another beta lactam antibiotic. The term non toxic for easily hydrolyzable esters shall mean that such esters are therapeutically acceptable for their intended form of administration. In general the easily hydrolyzable esters of the compounds of the invention are used in the oral administration, but their use in the parenteral administration is also within the scope of the invention. The compounds of formulae I and II are prepared by reacting a compound of the formula EMI9.1 or hydrolyzable esters or salts thereof with a compound of the formula EMI10.1 wherein R7 and n are as above, R is the same as R except that the substituents designated by R con taining free amino groups are in their protected form R12 and R13 are lower alkyl or taken together form CH2 CH2 X CH2 wherein x is an integer from 0 to 2, or a compound of the formulaEMI10.2 12 13 wherein n, R7, R1, R12 and R13 are as above. When R12 and R13 are lower alkyl groups, these substitutents are preferably the same. The reaction of the compound of formula IV with a compound of formula V or VI can be carried out in an organic solvent medium in the presence of a tertiary amine base. In carrying out this reaction, any conventional inert organic solvent can be utilized. Among the preferred organic solvents are included methylene chloride, chloroform, as well as other halogenated hydrocarbons. Furthermore, in carrying out this reaction, any conventional tertiary amine base can be utilized. Among the conventional tertiary amine bases that can be utilized are included trimethylamine, triethylamine, N,N diisopropyl ethyl amine or N methylmorpholine. In carrying out this reaction, temperature and pressure are not critical and the reaction can be carried out at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. If desired, higher or lower temperatures can be utilized. If desired, the compounds produced by the reaction of compounds of formula IV with the compound of formula V orVI, which contain a protected amine substituent, can be converted into the free amine by mild acid hydrolysis. Any conventional method of mild acid hydrolysis can be utilized to convert these reaction products to the compound of formula I containing the free amino substituent. On the other hand, the compound of formula I where R is a nitro group can be converted to the corresponding compound of formula I where R is NH2 by reduction such as hydrogen tion. Any conventional method of hydrogenating a nitro substituent to an amine can be utilized in carrying out this conversion. On the other hand, the reaction products of the compound of formula V or VI with the compound of formula IV, where the carboxyl group is protected by an ester substituent, can be converted to the corresponding compounds of formulae I and II which contain free carboxyl groups by mild basic hydrolysis or hydrogenolysis. Any conventional method of basic hydrolysis or hydrogenolysis can be utilized to produce the free acid of formulae I and II. If the compound of formula I or II is produced as the free acid, this compound can be esterified by any conventional means. The compound of formula V is prepared in accordance with this invention by first reacting a compound of the formulaEMI11.1 wherein X is a halogen or a leaving group and R7 and n are as above, with a compound of the formula EMI12.1 where R is as above to produce a compound of the formulaEMI12.2 wherein R7, R and n are as above. The compound of formula IX is then converted to a compound of the formulaEMI12.3 wherein R7, R and n are as above or a salt thereof which is then reacted with a compound of the formulaEMI12.4 wherein R12 and R13 are as above. The reaction of the compound of formula VII with the compound of formula VIII to produce a compound of the formula IX is carried out in the presence of a base and an organic solvent. Any conventional inert organic solvent can be utilized in carrying out this reaction. Among the preferred solvents are dimethylformamide, ethyl alcohol, dimethylsulfoxide. In carrying out this reaction, any strong base can be utilized. Among the preferred bases are included sodium carbonate, sodium hydride, with sodium hydride being especially preferred. Generally it is preferred to carry out this reaction at a temperature of from 70 C to 1500C. In the compound of formula VII, X can be any conventional leaving group, with mesyloxy or tosyloxy being preferred.On the other hand X can be a halide such as chloride or bromide. The compound of formula IX is converted to the compound of formula X by treatment with an aqueous inorganic acid, such as hydrochloric acid, at elevated temperatures. This reaction can be carried out in the presence of an organic solvent. Any conventional inert organic solvent can be utilized in carrying out this invention. Among the preferred inert organic solvents are included dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, with dioxane being especially preferred. In carrying out this reaction, temperatures from about 80 C to 1200C are generally utilized, with the reflux temperature being preferred. The use of an acid produced the compound of formula X in the form of its salt which, if desired, can be neutralized with a base to form the free base of formula X.Either the compound of formula X in the form of its salt or as a free base can be utilized in the subsequent reactions to produce the compound of formula V. Alternatively, the compound of formula IX can be converted to the compound of formula X by treatment with an organic aqueous alkali metal hydroxide in a lower alkano solvent. In carrying out this reaction, temperatures of from 30 C to 50 C are utilized. Where R in the compound of formula IX contains an amino group protected by means of an amino protecting group removable by acid hydrolysis, such as trityl or tert butoxy carbonyl, it is preferred to convert the compound of formula IX to the compound of formula X by treatment with an alkali metal hydroxide rather than an aqueous inorganic acid, since treatment with an inorganic acid hydrolizes the amino protecting group. If one treats the compound of formula IX, where R contains an amino protecting group, with an inorganic acid to produce the compound of formula X, it is necessary to protect the free amino group again to carry out the further reactions to produce the compound of formula V. Where R is converted to a free amino group in the compound of formula X, this compound contains both a primary and secondary amine group. Therefore, care must be taken in protectingthe primary amino group in the compound of formula X so as not to protect the secondary amino group. This can be done by conventional means since the primary amino group reacts first with compounds such as trityl chloride before the less reactive secondary amino group. In this manner, the compound of formula X is produced having its secondary amino group free and ready for further reaction. Compounds of formula IX where R is hydrogen can, if desired, be converted to the corresponding compounds whereR is CH2OH by reaction with aqueous formaldehyde at temperatures of 120 to 200 C in an autoclave. The compound of formulaeIX and X where R is CH2OH can be converted, if desired, to the corresponding compounds of formulae IX and X,where R is COOH,by oxidation. Any conventional method of oxidizing an alkanol to an acid such as by use of oxidizing agents such as potassium permanganate can be used in carrying out this reaction. If R in the compound of formula IX or X is nitro, this compound can be converted to the corresponding compound of formula IX or X where R is NH2 by hydrogenation such as described hereinbefore. This amino group can be protected in the manner described hereinbefore. On the other hand, the amino protecting group can, if desired, be removed by conventional means from the compound of formula X. The reaction of the compound of formula X with a compound of formula XI to produce the compound of formula V is carried out at temperatures from 70 to 110 C. In carrying out this reaction, the compound of formula XI may be utilized as the reaction medium. If desired, other conventional inert organic solvents may be present in this reaction medium.If the compound of formula X contains a free amino group, i.e. the compound of formula X where R is CH2 yNH2, this reaction produces the compound of formula V where R isEMI15.1 On the other hand, the compound of formula IX whereR is lower alkyl or hydrogen can be prepared by reacting a 5 to 7 membered heterocyclic compound having at most one additional nitrogen as the only hetero atom and from 0 to 2 additional double bonds, and of the formulaEMI15.2 wherein R14 is hydrogen or lower alkyl, with a compound of the formulaEMI15.3 wherein R7 and n is as above.This reaction is generally carried out in the presence of catalytic amounts of a lower alkanoic acid, with formic acid, acetic acid or propionic acid being preferred. In carrying out this reaction, no solvent is utilized and the reaction is carried out by heating the compound of formulaXII with the compound of formula XIII to a temperature of from 120 to 1500C in the presence of catalytic amounts of a lower alkanoic acid containing from 1 to 7 carbon atoms. The compounds of formula VII are known compounds. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of this invention the compound of formula VII where n is 1 can be prepared from compounds of the formulaEMI16.1 where R7, is a lower alkylene containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and n is O or 1 via the following intermediatesEMI16.2 wherein n, R7 , X and the ringEMI16.3 are as above. The compound of formula XIV is converted to the compound of formula XV by reduction.

70 In Tables VI XI, the results of the in vivo activity against certain microorganisms of compounds I, M and N are given.The results are for the in vivo activities of these compounds alone or in combination with other antibiotic compounds such as amdinocillin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, carbenicillin and cephalothin. The results in theseTables and the PD50 s were determined by the procedure set forth on page 160 in Beskid et al., Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, Vol. 20, No. 2, pp. 159 167 Aug. 1981 for in vivo studies . In the Tables, the fractional inhibitory concentration index FIC for synergistic combination of a compound of this invention X with known antibiotic compound Y is determined by the following formula FIC PD50 X combination PD50 Y combination PD50 X alone PD50 Y alone An FIC of 0.60 is indicative of synergy. The synergy rating in the Tables is as follows 0.50 to 0.60 0.40 to 0.49 0.3 to 0.39 0.3 In the combination, the parts are parts by weight, i.e.10 to 1 is 10 parts by weight to 1 part by weight. Example 71 A 100 mg injectable composition was prepared by aseptically filling in powder form 100 mg of 2S 2alpha, salpha,6beta 6 4 1H imidazol 1 yl methyl 1 piperi dinyl3methylene amino 3,3 dimethyl 6 oxo 4 thia 1 azabicyclo 3.2.0 heptane 2 carboxylic acid into a 1 ml sterile vial. To the vial there was added sufficient sterile distilled water to fill the vial. In this manner, this composition was ready for injection. Example 72 A 200 mg injectable composition was prepared by asep,tically filling in powder form 200 mg of 2S 2alpha, 5alpha,6beta 6 4 4,5 dihydro lH imidazol 2 yl methyl 1 piperidinyl methylene amino 3,3 dimethyl 7 oxo 4 thia 1 azabicyclo 3.2.0 heptane 2 carboxylic acid hydrochloride into a 1 ml sterile vial. To the vial there was added sufficient sterile distilled water to fill the vial. In this manner, this composition was ready for injection. Example 73 A 500 mg injectable composition was prepared by asep,tically filling in powder form 500 mg of 2S 2alpha,5alpha,6beta 6 4 1H imidazol 2 yl 1 piperidinyl methylene amino 3,3 dimethyl 7 oxo 4 thia 1 azabicyclo 3.2. 0 heptane 2 carboxylic acid hydrochloride trihydrate in a 1 ml sterile vial.
