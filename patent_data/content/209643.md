## Description
The present invention relates to a peptide composition useful for the malaria vaccine manufacture as well as for the preparation of diagnostic kits for the detection of malarial diseases having the following general formula Plasmodium are hemoparasites having a life cycle alternating between an invertebrate host, wherein they exhibit a sexual reproduction, and a vertebrate host wherein they multiply by simple schizogony. In the human body Plasmodium gives rise to malaria, a serious and very wide spread disease. Four species are pathogenic for the human organism Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium malarial, Plasmodium ovalis and Plasmodium falciparum. Among them Plasmodium falciparum is the etiological agent of the most serious disease, the so called malignat tertian. The malarial parasite is transmitted by the bite of anopheles mosquito, which is the invertebrate host, into the human body and there multiplies in the cells of the reticularendothelial and hepatic system. Such a first phase is followed, after about one week, by a second phase in which the parasite begins to invade the blood stream, to infect the erythrocytes and to divide. Some of the above parasites do not follow the schizogonic cycle and transform into gametocytes. The female mosquito by bitting a malarial man, having Plasmodium in the blood stream, together with the infected blood, receives also the gametocytes which, by a sexual reproduction cycle, give rise to thin and tapering elements called sporozoites. Said sporozoites, through the bite of the mosquito are again trasmitted to the human organism in which they begin a new schizogonic cycle. Vaccines have been developed for each phase of the life cycle of the malarial Plasmodium. A particular interest presents the development of vaccines against sporozoites which, if effective for the human organism, may prevent the subsequent stages responsible for the disease and the trasmission thereof. The possibility to immunize and protect human and animal organisms against malarial sporozoites has been studied by R.W. Nussenzweig et al. Mil. Med. 134, 1376 1969 by using irradiated sporozoites. Furthermore it has been found that such a protection is correlated with the production of specific antibodies for the protein present on the sporozoite surface, called circumsporozoite protein CS . Recently Dame et al. Science 225, 593 599 1984 cloned and sequenced the gene coding the CS protein of Plasmodium falciparum. Said protein, consisting of 412 aminoacids, has a central repeat domain composed of 37 tetrapeptides with the sequence Asn Ala Asn Pro and 4 tetrapeptides with the sequence Asn Asp Val Pro. A study carried out by using monoclonal antibodies specific for the CS protein has shown in this domain the presence of specific epitopes, therefore confirming the immunodominant property of this domain and the possibility to use it as a basis for the preparation of vaccine against malaria. Recently, W. Ripley Ballon et al. Science, The authors have found that, said peptides when linked to a carrier protein by an amino terminal cysteine residue, are able to induce a positive antibody response in experimental animals. Furthermore the produced antibodies recognize the native circumsporozoitic protein and inhibit However the use of said synthetic peptides for the preparation of vaccines against the Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites presents some limitations. The reasons of said limitations reside mostly on According to J.F. Young et al. Science The obtained proteins, tested on experimental animals, produce a high antibody title, and the induced antibodies recognize the native protein and block in an However by operating according to Young et al. in the above reference, it appears that it is first necessary to obtain a preliminary accurate evaluation of the possible risks connected to the use in human therapy of products obtained through genetic manipulation, and then to have some difficulties in producing and purifying the desired proteins. E. coli is a pathogenic bacterium and its use in a fermentation process to produce heterologous proteins requires accurate controls. Moreover the E. coli synthesized products remain in the cell and their extraction requires the breaking or lysing of the microorganisms. The extracted products must be subsequently removed and purified. In short such a process is complicated by the many steps required and low overall yields that make the process unattractive from an industrial point of view. It has been now found that it is possible to overcome the drawbacks of the prior art by using a peptide composition useful for the malaria vaccine manufacture as well as diagnostic kits for the detection of malarial diseases, which can be obtained in a pure form with a simple and economic process. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a peptide composition useful in the manufacture of a vaccine against malaria, as well a diagnostic kit to detect malarial diseases, consisting of a peptide mixture having the formula It is another object of the present invention to provide a process for the preparation of said peptide composition. A further object of the present invention is the use of said peptide composition to manufacture malaria vaccine as well as diagnostic kits to detect malarial diseases. Other objects of the present invention will be evident from the following specification and experimental examples. More particularly the peptide composition, according to the present invention, consists of a peptide mixture according to the following formula According to the present invention the above peptide mixture may be prepared by a process comprising In the step a of the process according to the present invention, the preparation of the tetrapeptide protected at the terminal amino group of Asn having the formula Generally the aminoacids conveniently protected at the amino or carboxylic function are dissolved in an inert non reactive solvent in the presence of condensation agents selected among those known in the art. Suitable organic solvents are chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons, aliphatic ketones, alkyl esters. Specific examples of said solvents are N, N dimethylformamide, chloroform, ethyl acetate, tetrahydrofuran. The amino protecting groups are selected among the acidolabile ones, i.e. that can be removed by acid hydrolysis. Particularly preferred is tert butyloxycarbonyl Boc . The reaction temperature of the condensation may generally vary from 10 C to 40 C and the corresponding reaction time is the one necessary to complete or substantially complete the reaction. According to the present invention tetrapeptide II protected at the amino terminal group is activated by reacting with a halogenated phenol derivative to produce its active ester at the terminal carboxyl group of Pro Halogenated phenol derivatives useful in the process according to the present invention are fluorinated or chlorinated derivatives. Particularly useful are pentachlorophenol, trichlorophenol and pentafluorophenol. The Pro carboxyl group activation reaction is carried out by contacting the tetrapeptide II , after removal of the protecting group from the Pro carboxyl group, with the halogenated phenol derivative, in a relative molar ratio of about 1 to 1, the reaction takes place in an inert organic solvent at a temperature from 10 C to 40 C. More particularly the reaction takes place at room temperature or near thereto. Examples of suitable organic solvents are the aprotic ones such as ethyl acetate or chlorinate aliphatic hydrocarbons. The obtained solution is cooled to a temperature of about 0 C and then reacted with a condensation agent in a molar ratio between condensation agent and one or other starting reagent equal to or higher than 1 1. More particularly as condensation agent dicyclohesylcarbodiimide is used. The resulting mixture is kept at a temperature from 10 C and 40 C for a period of 15 minutes to 4 hours. In practice it is advisable to operate at a temperature of about 0 for a period of time of 1 hour and at room temperature 20 25 C or near thereto for a corresponding period of 1 hour. By operating within the preferred conditions tetrapeptide III is obtained having a melting point of 160 164 C and a α 22 D of 74.8 c 0.75 methanol . In this step the amino protecting group is removed from said activated tetrapeptide III by acid hydrolysis. The acidolysis reaction is carried out by using trifluoroacetic or concentrated hydrochloric acid at room temperature for about 1 hour. In step d of the process according to the present invention said activated tetrapeptide IV , after removal of the protecting group, is polycondensed in the presence of an excess quantity of an organic catalyst of basic nature, selected from among tert alkyl amines wherein alkyl group consists of 1 to 4 carbon atoms. The preferred amine is triethylamine. According to the present invention the reaction takes place in liquid phase in an inert organic solvent. Suitable organic solvents are dimethylsulphoxide, dimethylformamide, hexamethylphosphoramide. The reaction temperature may vary from 15 C to 40 C about and the corresponding reaction time may vary from 24 hours to 4 days. In pratice the reaction is carried out at room temperature or near thereto. In such a case the time required to complete or to substantially complete the reaction is roughly 72 hours. At the end of the reaction a peptide composition is obtained from which a peptide mixture is recovered, by gel chromatography, having the formula Said mixture may be utilized as such to manufacture malaria vaccines or diagnostic kits to detect malarial diseases. According to another embodiment of the present invention such a mixture may be fractioned to obtain mixture having a narrower molecular weight MW distribution. The fractionation is carried out by gel chromatography by using a 2.5 X 80 cm column with a Sephadex Particularly suitable are peptide mixtures having MW of about 16,000 and n values between 37 to 41. Both the overall mixture and the single fractions show a biological activity in mice. Particularly active is the peptide mixture having n from 37 to 41. Therefore all such mixtures may be used to manufacture malaria vaccines as well as diagnostic kits to detect malarial diseases. The following experimental examples will illustrate the invention. In a 250 ml reaction flask, fitted with stirrer, 10 g 42.5 mmole of HCl.H Pro OBz and 150 ml of N,N dimethylformamide were introduced. The mixture was stirred and a solution was obtained. 7.1 ml 45 mmole of diisopropylethylamine DIPEA and 8.4 g 62 mmole of N hydroxybenzotriazole HOBt were added under stirring to said solution and the solution was cooled to 0 C. To said cooled solution 9.37 g 45 mmole of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide DCI were added. The condensation reaction was carried out keeping the solution temperature of 0 C for a period of 90 minutes. Thereafter the solvent was evaporated from the reaction mixture, the residue was dissolved using 200 ml of ethyl acetate EtoAc and washed successively with 30 ml of a 5 w v sodium bicarbonate solution, 30 ml of a 10 w v citric acid solution and then 30 ml of a sodium chloride saturated solution. The organic phase was separated from the solution and dryed with about 10 g of anhydrous MgSO₄. The solvent was then evaporated from the solution and the residue was recovered by crystallization from 100 ml of EtOAC n hexane 1 1 v v . 12 g of benzyl ester of tert butyloxycarbonyl asparaginyl proline were obtained having a melting point of 105 106 C and a α 22 D of 83.6 c 1.2 methanol . 117 g 28 mmole of Boc Asn Pro OBz obtained according to step a were added to 200 ml of a BtOAc solution containing 4 N HCl. The stirred solution was kept at room temperature 20 25 C for 1 hour about. At the end of the acidolytic reaction the solvent was evaporated from the reaction mixture and the residue was triturated with diethyl ether to obtain a white solid product. Said white solid together with 5.7 g 30 mmole of Boc Ala OH, 5.5 g 41 mmole of HOBt and 3.08 ml 30 mmole of N methylmorpholine NMM were added to 100 ml of DMF. The solution was cooled to 0 C and then 6.3 g 30 mmole of HCl were added thereto. The reaction was carried out at 0 C for 90 minutes. At the end of such a period the solvent was completely evaporated from the reaction mixture the residue was dissolved in 200 ml of EtOAc and then was extracted by subsequent washing in the same way as reported in step a . At the end the organic phase was separated and dried over anhydrous Mg SO₄. The solvent was separated from the organic phase and the residue was recovered by trituration with n hexane. 10 g 73 yield of benzyl ester of tert butyloxycarbonylalanylasparaginylproline were obtained having melting point 71 72 C and α 22 D of 94.7 c 1.5 methanol . The synthesis was carried out in the same way as in the above step a using 9.9 g 20 mmole of Boc Ala Asn Pro OBz. At the end of the acidolytic reaction, the residue was dissolved in 100 ml of DMF containing 5.1 g 22 mmole of Boc Asn OH. The condensation reaction was carried out by keeping the solution at a temperature of 0 C for a period of time of 2 hours about. Then the procedure of step a was followed. 6 g yield 50 of benzyl ester of tert butyloxy carbonilasparaginylalanylasparaginylproline were obtained having a melting point of 153 154 C and α 22 D of 91.1 c 0.9, methanol . In a 200 ml reaction vessel, fitted with stirrer, 50 ml of methanol were introduced as well as 1,5 g 2,5 mmole of Boc Asn Ala Asn Pro OBz and 600 mg 9.5 mmole of ammonium formiate. To said solution kept under a nitrogen atmosphere and stirred, 1 g of palladium on coal 10 catalyst was added. From the reaction mixture kept under stirring a suspension was obtained. Said stirred suspension was kept under a nitrogen atmosphere and at room temperature up to a complete removal of the protecting benzyl group from proline carboxylic group. At the end of the reaction, the catalyst was removed by filtration from the suspension and the solvent was evaporated undervacuum up to dryness. Said residue was dissolved in 50 ml of EtOAc containing 670 mg 2,5 mmole of pentachlorophenol. The solution was cooled to 0 C and 520 mg 2,5 mmole of HCl were added thereto. The stirred solution was kept at 0 C for 1 hour and then at room temperature for a period of 1 hour about. At the end of such a period the obtained dicyclohexylurea was recovered by filtration and the solvent was completely evaporated. The residue was treated at 70 C with 100 ml of isopropyl alcohol and then diethyl ether was added thereto up to incipient crystallization. Thus, there was obtained 1 g of the desired product pentachlorophenolic ester of tert butyloxycarbonyl asparaginylalanylasparaginylproline having a melting point of 160 164 C and α 22 D of 74.8 C c 0.75, methanol . 500 mg 0.65 mmole of the Boc Asn Ala Asn Pro OPCP obtained in example 2 were dissolved in 2.0 ml of trifluoracetic acid. The solution was stirred and kept at room temperature for 1 hour about. At the end of the reaction, the solvent was evaporated under vacuum and the oily residue was tritured with diethylether until a white solid was obtained. The product was suspended in 2 ml of dimethyl sulphoxide and the mixture was stirred to obtain a solution. To said solution, kept under stirring, 300 ml of triethylamine were added in small proportions. The solution was kept at room temperature for 24 hours and, after addition of 100 ml of triethylamine, for other 48 hours. At the end of the reaction the solution was added dropwise, in a period of 5 minutes about, to 350 ml of anyhydrous ethanol kept under mild stirring. The obtained precipitate was removed from the suspension by filtration and dried under vacuum. The product was divided into fractions of 30 mg each about, each fraction was dissolved in 1 ml of 0.1 N acetic acid and subyected to chromatography separation. A 2.5 X 80 mm Sephadex The fractions were collected at intervals of 12 minutes. The fractions from 26 to 39 were gathered together and lyophilized. 115 mg yield 40 of polymer were obtained consisting of a mixture of H Asn Ala Asn Pro Said polymer was then fractioned by gel chromatography operating in the same way as above using a column filled with Sephadex At the end 30 mg of polymer were obtained having an average molecular weight of 16.000, corresponding to an n of 37 to 41 as well as 75 mg of polymer having a molecular weight lower than 16.000. The molecular weight of the fractions having n from 37 to 41 was confirmed by chromatography on a 1,5 X 100 cm column filled with BIOGEL The operation was performed at room temperature with a flow rate of 2,5 ml hour and collecting the fractions every hour. The fraction of synthetic peptides with n 37 41, was suspended in distilled water and then, aliquots of said suspension mantained at 70 C, were diluted in a phosphate buffered saline PBS pH 7.8 at final concentration of 1 µg ml. 100 µl of said solution were transferred into microtiter plates, communely used in the ELISA procedure. The microtiter plates were incubated overnight, at room termperature 20 25 C in a wet room. At the end of the incubation, the plates were washed 4 times with PBS containing 0,05 by wt. of Tween 20 PBS T and then saturated with 200 µl of PBS T containing 5 by wt. of powdered lipid free milk PBS T M . The plates were left to stand for about 1 hour at room temperature. After removal of the saturated solution, 100µl of serum samples to be tested, suitably diluted in PBS T M 2,5 , were added in each well of the microtiter plates. The plates were incubated for about 1 hour at room temperature. Then the plates were washed 4 times with PBS T and added with 100 µl of peroxidase linked antiserum IgG fraction from goat against IgG, IgM or the whole human or animal immunoglobulin fraction. The antiserum was suitably diluted in 2,5 PBS T M. After incubation for 1 hour at room temperature, the plates were washed 4 times with PBS T. Then 100 µl of a solution of orto phenilendiammine in 0,1M citrate buffer 0,4 mg ml containing 0,01 of H₂O₂ were added to the plates. The enzymatic reaction was stopped 20 minutes later by adding 2,5 N H₂SO₄. The optical density in each well was determinated by absorbance measuring at 492 nm using a micro ELISA Multiskan Titertek . The results were expressed as the difference between the optical densities of coated and uncoated plates figura 1 . Figura 1 in abscissa were reported serum dilution
