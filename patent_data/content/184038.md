## Description
Iron nickel chrcsnium molybdenum alloy. The subject invention is directed to a novel iron nickel chromium Fe Ni Cr alloy characterized by a high degree of resistance to carburization and which affords a combination of other desirable metallurgical properties, including structural stability at elevated temperatures of ca. 980 10950C, the ability to be both hot and cold worked, good resistance to corrosion including resistance to chloride attacks, etc. INVENTION BACKGROUND As is known, iron base, nickel chromium alloys are extensively used in a host of diverse applications by reason of one or more and within limits strength, ductility, corrosion resistance, etc. Such attributes notwithstanding, this type of alloy generally suffers from an inability to resist satisfactorily the destructive toll occasioned by carburization, a phenomenon by which the alloy structure is environmentally degraded from the surface inward. As a consequence, the load bearing capacity of the alloy is adversely affected as manifested by impaired strength stress rupture, creep , lowered ductility, etc.Usually the initial attack is along the grain boundaries and this tends to accelerate failure, or at least premature removal of a given alloy component from its operational environment. In any case, if the carburization problem could be substantially minimized without subverting other properties, such an alloy would find expanded use for such applications as the petrochemical and coal gasification fields, ethylene pyrolysis, etc., areas in which alloys are exposed to a combination of carbonaceous environments and high temperature. But ln addressing the problem of carburization resistance, it would be self defeating to achieve success at the expense of other desired properties as contemplated herein, e.g., high temperature structural stability over prolonged periods of time, elevated temperature stress rupture strength, workability, etc. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It has now been discovered that an iron nickel chromium alloy of special chemistry and containing carefully correlated percentages of iron, nickel, chromium, molybdenum and carbon and certain other constituents discussed herein results in a i markedly enhanced carburization resistant material at temperature levels at least as high as 980 10BSOC. Moreover, the subject alloy is ii workable , iii not prone to form deleterious amounts of topological closepacked phases prematurely such as sigma, and otherwise offers iv structural stability over substantial periods of time upon exposure to elevated temperature.Further, the alloy is v weldable and vi affords a high degree of resistance to pitting attack in aggressive corrosive media. In addition to the foregoing, it has been also found that the contemplated alloy offers enhanced oxidation resistance, a phenomenon by which the alloy surface undergoes attack in oxygen containing environments at high temperature. As a consequence, the msterial continuously undergoes weight loss, the surface spalls off. As would be expected the oxidation problem is particularly acute in thin section mill product forms, strip, sheet, thin wall tubing, etc. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Generally speaking, the subject invention contemplates an iron nickel chrcmium alloy containing about 24 to 35 nickel, about 19 to 25 chranium, about 1.5 to 6 molybdenum, carbon in an amount not exceeding about 0.12 , up to 1.5 or 2 manganese, up to 1 aluminum, up to 1 titanium, up to 1 silicon and up to about 0.3 nitrogen, the balance, apart from residual amounts of deoxidizing and cleaning elements,and impurities, being iron. Unless otherwise indicated, all percentages in this specification and claims are by weight. In carrying the invention into practice, molybdenum plays a major positive role in maximizing resistance to carburization. Advantageously, the molybdenum content should be maintained at a level of about 2 or more in seeking optimum carburization resistance. Percentages much beyond 4 do not offer an appreciable advantage in this respect, given cost considerations, and generally it will not exceed 4.5 . However, where resistance to corrosion, particularly to chloride attack, is important, the molybdenum can be as high as about 6 . Cranium imparts resistance to corrosion but should not exceed about 24 or 25 since it lends to sigma formation at elevated temperature and attendant embrittlement problems. A range of 20 23 is quite satisfactory. The total chranium plus molybdenum content preferably does not exceed 26 or 27 since molybdenum also lends to sigma formation. where high temperature applications are not involved, the chromium plus molybdenum content can be extended to 29 . Nickel contributes to good workability and mechanical properties. Should the nickel level fall much below 24 the stability of the alloy could be impaired, particularly if the chranium and or molybdenum is at the high end of their respective ranges. On the other hand, nickel percentages above 35 up to 42 increase cost without significant prcperty degradation. A nickel range of 28 to 35 is considered most beneficial. Carbon in excess, say 0.3 , detracts from pitting resistance.In addition, workability is adversely affected however, carbon does add to strength and other properties and, accordingly, a range of about 0.04 or 0.05 to 0.1 is deemed distinctly advantageous. For workability and other benefits titanium should be present, but amounts above 1 are not required. A range from 0.1 or 0.2 to 0.75 is quite beneficial. Aluminum can be used as a deoxidizer and as an aid to workability. A range of 0.05 to 0.5 is quite satisfactory. By so controlling the carbon, titanium, and aluminum as well as the high percentage constituents Mo, Cr, Ni the alloys are not only workable but can be produced using air melting practice. This is not to say vacuum processing is precluded but there is an economic advantage in the former. Manganese and silicon can both be present in amounts up to 2 and 1 , respectively. Higher amounts are unnecessary. Where oxidation resistance is of importance manganese should not exceed about 0.6 .Manganese promotes weldability, particularly at the higher end of its range with aluminum at the lower end of its range. It is deemed that nitrogen, a potent austenite former, can be present, a range of 0.05 to 0.25 being considered satisfactory. Nitrogen is considered to be beneficial at the lower nickel levels. One advantageous composition comprises about 28 to 35 nickel, 20 to 24 cranium, at least 1.5 and up to 4.5 molybdenum, carbon present up to 0.12 , titanium present up to 1 , up to 1 aluminum, up to 2 manganese, up to 1 silicon and up to 0.3 nitrogen, the balance, apart from impurities and residual deoxidizing and cleaning elements, being iron. Impurities that may be present are those usually associated with alloys of this type, in amounts that do not adversely affect their basic characteristics. The following information and data are given as illustrative of the invention. Carburization Resistance 14kg. samples of various compositions were air melted and forged, the compositions being given in Table 1, Alloys A, B and C being beyond and Alloys 1 and 2 being within the invention.

These were placed in a tray and put into a muffle type furnace, the temperature being 9820C. The test was conducted for 100 hours using a gaseous atmosphere of 2Z methane plus hydrogen. After exposure, the samples were water quenched and then weighed to determine weight gain data.The results are reported in Table II.

Alloy C 7.87Z Mo showed some further improvement but the cofit associated with such molybdenum levels would not likely warrant such percentages on a commercial scale. Weight gain is essentially a measure of how many atoms of carbon have been absorbed but without regard as to to the depth of effect.Thus, concentration versus depth profiles were determined and Figure 1 reflects this information. Figure 1 confirms, in essence, the data ofTable II. As is manifest, with increasing molybdenum percentages the penetration profile shrinks indicating that less diffusion has occurred. Figure 2 depicts surface potential versus molybdenum content.This may be viewed as the chemical effect of molybdenum on carbon diffusion, or specifically the effect of molybdenum on gas metal reaction at the surface, carbon solubility, or carbon activity coefficient. The surface potential appears to be a quite linear decreasing function of molybdenum, at least up to 4X. The behavior at 8 molybdenum is not clearly understood. We have also determined that molybdenum decreases the carbon diffusion coefficient.Oxidation Resistance Tables III chemistry and IV data afford a comparison of the oxidation resistance behavior of alloys within the invention versus commercial control alloys of somewhat similar composition. The oxidation test was one of cyclic oxidation using 14 kg.samples air melted forged to flats, hot rolled to 7.9 mm and cold rolled to 3.2 mm. The test comprised subjecting specimens for 15 minutes at 10930cm cooling for 5 minutes in air, heating again to 10930C holding for 15 minutes, again cooling 5 minutes in air, until testing was completed. Specimens were checked at 100 hr. intervals. Prior to test the specimens were annealed at 11770C and water quenched. Oxide was removed bv grinding to 120 grit.

Charpy V Notch impact testing is often used as a means of predicting whether an alloy will undergo embrittlement on being exposed to elevated temperatures for prolonged periods. While a 1000 hour test period might normally be deemed sufficiently severe, tests were also conducted for 3000 hours at temperatures of 7600C and 8160C, The composition of the alloys tested are given in Table III.

The alloys of the invention Alloys 3 and 4 were quite resistant to premature embrittlement as evident from Table VII. Even upon 3000 hour testing the alloys within the invention performed satisfactorily. AlloyD 9.62 Mo did not stand up at 7600C 100 hr. It was sigma prone. To further study stability a commercial size 204 kg centrifugally cast hollow billet was extruded to a tube shell and cold worked to 5.7 rtin dia. x 6.9 mm wall tube. Composition 0.06 C, 0.03 Mn, 0.33 Si, 31.98 Ni, 21.S5 Cr, 0.18 Al, 0.32 Ti, 3.12 Ho, Fe balance . The specimen was annealed at 11770C for an hour and air cooled prior to test. The tube was rupture tested at 649 Ct8.5 kgf mm2for the tremendously long period of 26,394 hours 3 years and then discontinued, no failure having occurred.A metallographic study showed M23C6 carbides and very fine particles of sigma within the grains which were deemed innocuous, particularly since a portion of the specimen was placed in a viec and bent to ascertain if embrittlement had occurred. The ductile nature of the specimen was obvious.Weldability Compositions for weldability are given in Table VIII. In this connection, two alloy series were evaluated one involving variations in aluminum and manganese Alloys 5 8 , the other Alloys A, B, 1, 2, and C exploring the effect of molybdenum. Material was provided as thick x 2 wide hot forged flats which were overhauled and rolled to 7.8mum thick x 50.8 mn wide forVarestraint test samples.

All the specimens performed at least as more satisfactorily as the commercial control alloy. Of the molybdenum series, the high molybdenum material Alloy C, 7.87t Mo was more susceptible to cracking.Regarding the Al Mn series, the low aluminum, high manganese material Alloy 8 was the most crack resistant. Accordingly, by using molybdenum levels within the invention, particularly with low aluminum, 0.04 to 0.35, and high manganese1 say 0.3 to 0.6Z, weldability is improved.Pitting Corrosion Resistance Data reported in Table X give an indication of pitting resistance. Samples were cold rolled to 3.4Eriin and annealed at either 11770C or 12880C for one hour, followed by water quenching. Specimens approx. 17.75 x 7.6 mm were prepared by grinding to 320 grit and then exposed 4 hours at 350C in acidified 10.8 2 o Fecal. 6H2 O Smith Test .After exposure, weight loss per unit surface area was determined and the specimens visually evaluated for the appearance of pits.

It detracts from the resistance to pitting imparted by molybdenum. Accordingly, where corrosion resistance is important carbon should not exceed about 0.12Z Also, for such purposes the molybdenum can be extended to 6 . Irrespective of carburization resistance and other attributes, if the alloys are unworkable, then they would find little utility. However, alloys within the invention are both hot and cold workable. Using Alloys 3, 4 and D of Table VI, these alloys forged readily and the forgings upon inspection were of high quality. Hardness data are given in Table XI for Riven annealing temperatures. Also included is hardness in the cold worked condition. In this connection, specimens were cold rolled to about 3.2 mS thick from thickness given in Table XII.

This together with the hardness data reflects that the alloys have excellent cold workability and a low work hardening rate. It might be added that high carbon is not beneficial to workability.
