# Rotary variable resistor.

## Abstract
A rotary variable resistor comprising an insulation subs trate 5,12,13 having a partial ring form resistor layer 4,10,11 on the surface thereof, an operational shaft 2,3 rotatably supported at a central portion of the insulation subs trate, a brush supporter 7,16 of a roational body disposed substantially at one tip of the operational shaft 2,3 and hold ing a brush 6,14,15 rotatably sliding on the resistor layer, and a cover case 9,19 of an insulation mold material covering the brush and the brush supporter, the improvement is that the rotational movement of the operational shaft is effectively stopped by a protrusion 27,28 disposed on the inner wall 9 ,19 of a thick part of a plastic mold cover case and on the side of lead terminals 8,8 ,8 ,17,17 ,17 ,18,18 ,18 .
