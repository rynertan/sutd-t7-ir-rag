# CONTROLLED RELEASE INSECTICIDE

## Abstract
A process for treating carrier granules containing a liquid pesticide to make them useful in preparing a pesticide spike which can be driven into the ground. The process comprises mixing the ganular carrier containing an absorbed pesticide with a hardener to produce coated granules, initiating curing of the hardener, and allowing the hardener to harden so as to produce hardened, coated granules. In the preferred embodiment, disulfoton pesticide is absorbed on an attupulgite type clay. A urea formaldehyde resinous hardener is used and a suitable curing catalyst is included. The granules are formed into a spike shaped briquette by conventional briquetting techniques. Fertilizer may be mixed with the granules before briquetting to form a pesticide fertilizer spike.
