# Semiconductor devices consisting of epitaxial material.

## Abstract
A semiconductor device consisting of epitaxial material is provided with at least one monoatomic layer of doping atoms, i.e. with a layer which is just one atom thick. A particularly preferred device is a field effect transistor in which case the Dirac delta doped layer 13 extends between the source and drain zones 18, 19 respectively. The field effect transistor can be constructed either with a homogeneous structure or with a hetero structure or with a superlattice structure. The field effect transistors described herein have a high transconductance and are capable of operating at high current densities.
