# Surfactant treated polyolefinic microporous materials capable of multiple re wetting with aqueous solutions.

## Abstract
Hydrophilic polyolefinic microporous materials are pre pared by impregnating a normally hydrophobic polyolefinic microporous substrate material with a solution of a non ionic alkylophenoxy poly ethyleneoxy ethanol surfactant having an HLB of 10 to 15 in a solvent system comprising 55 to 65 volume percent methanol or acetone and 35 to 45 volume percent water. Polyolefinic microporous materials rendered hydrophilic by this technique not only wet rapidly, but in addition may be multiply re wet with aqueous solutions, such as aqueous alkali solutions, with excellent retention of their hydrophilic properties. Such materials find particular applica tion as battery separators and an membranes for use in vari ous chemical, medical and biotechnical processes.
