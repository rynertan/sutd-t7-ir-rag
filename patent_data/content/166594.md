# Apparatus for automatically correctly relocating the toe part of a stocking or the like on a setting frame.

## Abstract
The invention relates to apparatus for automatically cor rectly relocating the toe part of a stocking fitted over a setting frame F prior to steam setting, when the toe part is misplaced on the setting frame. The apparatus includes a seam locator 40 , comprising a row of electrodes 42 covered by a strip 43 of piezoelectric conductive rubber. When the locator is pressed against a misplaced toe part, rupper strip 43 is com pressed locally by the correspondingly misplaced protruding seam which bounds the toe part, causing an electrical circuit to be made via the underlying electrode 42 at that location. The direction and magnitude of rotation of a locator motor 25 is controlled in dependence upon the particular electrode 42 rendered conductive. The motor 25 rotates a pair of relocat ing rollers 33, 133 which engage the toe part on opposite sides of the setting frame F , and slide the toe part transversely on the setting frame to correct its position.
