## Description
Machine for lasting side portions of shoes This invention is concerned with a machine for lasting side portions of shoes, comprising a support for supporting, bottom uppermost, a shoe comprisinc an upper carried on a last and an insole on the last bottom, and two side lasting assemblies arranged so as to act on opposite side portions of a shoe supported by the shoe support, wherein each side lasting assembly comprises clamping means, comprising a plurality of clamp members arranged side by side and movable independently of one another inwardly towards the shoe support whereby side portions of the upper of a shoe supported by the shoe support can be clamped thereby, at a locality spaced from the featherline of the shoe, against its last, and lasting element means, comprising a plurality of lasting elements arranged side by side and mounted for inward movement relative to the clamping means towards the shoe support, the arrangement being such that, after side portions of a shoe supported by the shoe support have been clamped by the clamp members as aforesaid, the lasting elements are caused to move inwardly to cause lasting marginal portions of the side portions of the shoe upper to be wiped over and pressed against corresponding marginal portions of the insole. One such machine is described in US PatentSpecification No. 3685072, in which each of the clamp members is mounted for pivotal movement, about an axis extending generally lengthwise of the shoe bottom, spring means being provided for urging the shoe engaging portions of each clamp member inwardly relative to its pivot. Thus, in the operation of the machine, inward movement of the clamp members is effective firstly to bring the shoe engaging portions of each clamp member into engagement with the shoe, whereafter each such member is caused to pivot about its axis, while in engagement with the shoe, thus causing the shoe engaging portion thereof to move upwardly whereby they stretch the upper material smoothly over the last.However, it will be appreciated that, because of the asymmetric shape of a shoe last, the clamp members will tend to ride up the side portions of the last, when brought into engagement therewith, by different distances, so that the upper will not be clamped in any uniform manner at the opposite sides of the last. Furthermore, if the clamp members are set to a similar height in relation to the shoe support, it may well arise, again because of the asymmetric shape of the last, that either one of the clamp members will clamp the shoe upper at too low a position in relation to the featherline, or the other clamp member may well pass over the featherline.In the former case the upper may therefore not be adequately clamped for the subsequent lasting operation, while in the latter case the clamp member may well interfere with the application of bedding pressure by the lasting elements to the wiped over lasting marginal portions of the upper. Furthermore, bearing in mind that the machine normally will be expected to be used on both left and right shoes, any compensation of the heightwise position of the clamp members, in order to achieve uniform clamping of the upper against its last at the opposite sides thereof, will also require a left right switching arrangement, if the clamping means of the subject machine are to be used. It is the object of the present invention to provide an improved side lasting machine in which, using a simple constructipn of clamping means, the heightwise positions of the clamp members can be automatically varied according to whether the shoe being clamped is a left or a right, but without the need for any left right switching arrangement. In accordance with the invention, in a machine as set out in the first paragraph above, at least one clamp member of the clamping means of each side lasting assembly is mounted for sliding movement heightwise of the shoe to be clamped thereby, the arrangement being such that the heightwise position of said one member in relation to the shoe support is not affected when said member is urged against a substantially vertically extending part of a side portion of the shoe, but when said one member is urged against a part of a shoe side portion which is significantly inclined to the vertical, said member is caused to move upwardly in its mounting. It will of course be appreciated that the wall of a last usually extends substantially vertically in the outside waist region thereof, while in the inside waist region it tends to be significantly inclined to the vertical.Thus, in using the machine in accordance with the invention, the or each clamp member which engages with the inside waist region of the shoe will move upwardly in its mounting and in thus moving upwardly, will move further inwardly in relation to the shoe bottom. Where the last wall extends substantially vertically, it will be appreciated, the particular point of engagement therewith by the clamp member will not be so significant, since the upper will be held relatively close to the featherline by virtue of the last shape, even though the clamp member is spaced from the featherline.By moving the or each clamp member engaging the inside waist region upwardly as aforesaid, on the other hand, thus facilitating further inward movement thereof, the upper will again be clamped more closely to the featherline, so that substantially uniform clamping of the upper at both sides thereof can be achieved. It has been found that conveniently, in accordance with the invention, sliding movement of the or each clamp member can be limited to the distance in the order of 6mm, such distance being such as to enable a clamp member which rides up the last wall as aforesaid to clamp the upper against said wall close to the featherline. Conveniently, the or each clamp member has generally the shape of an inverted L so as to allow a shoe upper being clamped thereby to be engaged more closely to the featherline in the inside waist region thereof. For ensuring that the or each clamp member mounted for heightwise sliding movement is initially in a lowermost position in its mounting, preferably each such clamp member is spring urged downwardly. It has been found that a light spring is sufficient for this purpose. For enabling heightwise sliding movement to take place, furthermore, the or each clamp member is mounted on a pin. In addition, preferably the or each clamp member can pivot about the axis of such pin, so as to accommodate more readily to the contour of the side of the last engaged thereby. In one embodiment of the invention the or each pin extends vertically in the side lasting assembly, that is to say, lies in a first plane extending transversely of the shoe bottom and also in a second plane extending generally lenthwise of the shoe bottom and disposed normal to the first plane. Alternativelyr the pivotal axis of the or each clamp member may lie in such first plane but be inclined to said second plane the arrangement being such that the axis passes close to the shoe engaging surface of an upper, forwardly projecting, portion of the inverted b shaped member. Such inclination of the axis, by being arranged close to the shoeengaging surface of the member, enables the amount of displacement of the clamp member about its axis, in accommodating to the overall contour of the shoe bottom, to be minimised, but without affecting the amount of such accommodation. Furthermore, especially when operating upon shoes of a high heeled style, the inclined axis has been found to be especially advantageous in that it provides not only pivotal movement for accommodating to the plan contour of the shoe bottom, but at the same time it provides a tilting motion which more readily accommodates to the heightwise contour of the shoe bottom.Thus, in the inside waist region of the shoe, which is of course the region in which the contour of the shoe bottom is most significantly distinguished from the overall outline of the high wood of the last, and further in which region the shoe bottom is most significantly inclined, when viewed from the side, the amount of pivotal movement to accommodate to the general plan contour is accompanied by a proportionate tilting movement to accommodate to the heightwise contour. Bearing in mind that the machine in accordance with the invention will be likely to be used over a wide range of shoe styles, a compromise angle of inclination for each pivotal axis has to be selected, and conveniently, in accordance with the invention, said pivotal axis is inclined to said second plane at an angle of some 300. As is known in machines of the type set out in the first paragraph, conveniently also each side lasting assembly is mounted for adjusting movement heightwise relative to the shoe support. In this way, the initial position of the clamp members can be set in such a way as to ensure that the upper is properly clamped against its last for the subsequent lasting operation to be performed thereon. The clamping means in accordance with the invention have been found to be especially suitable for use in a machine wherein adhesive applying means is provided for applying adhesive progressively along opposite side portions of the shoe bottom for bonding the wiped over marginal portion of the upper to the corresponding marginal portions of the insole, said adhesive applying means comprising two nozzles mounted on a support between which and the shoe support relative heightwise movement can take place to bring the nozzles into contact with the shoe bottom and also relative lengthwise movement can thereafter take place, means also being provided for moving the nozzles outwardly to cause the nozzles to engage the lasting marginal portions of the opposite side portions of the shoe upper. Such adhesive applying means are described e.g. in UK PatentSpecification No. 1087700. More specifically, in the machine in accordance with the present invention preferably the nozzle support also supports an insole engaging member by which the amount of relative heightwise movement between the nozzle support and the shoe support is limited, the adhesive applying means is caused to apply adhesive as aforesaid after the.clamping means has been caused to clamp the side portions of the upper against the last, and the nozzles are arranged to apply adhesive to the lasting marginal portions of the opposite side portions of the shoe upper as relative lengthwise movement takes place as aforesaid.In such a machine, it will be appreciated, it becomes even more desirable for the lasting marginal portions of the upper to be clamped in such a manner that they project beyond the insole by a relatively uniform amount in order that the adhesive can be applied to said portions of the upper at a desired distance from the plane of the insole. By the clamping means in accordance of the invention facilitating the substantially uniform clamping of the upper against the last, an appropriate arrangement can thus be achieved. Preferably, furthermore, the insole engaging member is mounted for heightwise adjustment on the nozzle support, so that the distance of the applied adhesive from the plane of the insole can be varied according to the size of the lasting marginal portions projecting beyond said plane. Conveniently, each nozzle is mounted on the nozzle support for pivotal movement, independently of the other nozzle, about an axis extending lengthwise of the shoe bottom, a single piston and cylinder arrangement being provided for controlling such pivotal movement, the cylinder of which is operatively connected to one nozzle and a piston rod thereof to the other. In this way, a relatively simple construction of adhesive applying means is provided. The invention has been found to be particularly useful in a machine wherein each of the clamp members of each side lasting assembly has one or more lasting elements associated therewith, and further wherein each side lasting assembly also comprises lasting band means comprising at least one upper engaging band portion of flexible sheet material arranged to be interposed between the clamp members and the shoe upper, side portions of which are to be lasted, as described e.g. in our co pending European PatentApplication No. 81304527.5. In accordance with the present invention, furthermore, the or each band portion provides a back up for the lasting marginal portions of the side portions of the upper during the application of adhesive thereto.It will thus be appreciated that, using such an arrangement, the lasting marginal portions of the upper, which project above the plane of the insole by a relatively uniform amount at both sides, because of the action of the clamping means, can be maintained at a substantially constant angle during the application of adhesive thereto, with the result that the distance of the applied adhesive from the plane of the insole can be reliably controlled. Furthermore, the lasting band means of each assembly preferably comprises, as described in the lastmentioned patent application, a plurality of band portions arranged side by side, one portion being associated with each clamp member. In accordance with the present invention, furthermore, the most toewardly disposed clamp member of each assembly, together with its associated band portion and lasting element s , is moved inwardly subsequent to the application of adhesive by the adhesive applying means, while the remainder of the clamp members and associated band portions and elements are moved inwardly as aforesaid prior to the application of adhesive. In this manner, it is ensured that the most toewardly disposed members, band portions and elements in no way impede the progressive operation of the adhesive applying means. There now follows a detailed description, to be read with reference to the accompanying drawings, of one machine in accordance with the invention, which machine has been selected for description by way of non limiting example. In the accompanying drawings Figure 1 is a front prospective view of the machine in accordance with the invention Figure 2 is a view in front elevation, showing details of a left hand side lasting assembly of said machine Figure 3 is a diagrammatic view, showing a section through a waist region of a last, with clamping means of the machine in accordance with the invention in clamping engagement therewith Figure 4 is a view in front elevation, showing details of adhesive applying means of the machine in accordance with the invention Figure 5 is a fragmentary view, corresponding to part of Figure 2, but showing a modified clamp member and Figure 6 is a fragmentary plan view showing two modified clamp members of one of the side lasting assemblies, indicating their relationship with a shoe bottom clamped thereby. The machine in accordance with the invention now to be described is generally similar, except as hereinafter described, to the machine described in the aforementionedEuropean Patent Application, being a combined heel seat and side lasting machine comprising a shoe support 10 on which a last can be supported bottom uppermost, with an insole I located on the bottom thereof and a shoe upper U positioned thereon, heel seat wiping instrumentalities 12 and a heel band 14, and also two side lasting assemblies generally designated 16, arranged forwardly of the heel seat instrumentalities, one at either side of the shoe support 10. The side lasting assemblies are mirror opposite of one another and the left hand assembly will now be described with reference to Figure 2. The side lasting assembly 16 comprises a sub frame 18 carried on a plate 20 mounted on a main machine frame 22 by pin and slot connections to facilitate pivoting of the side lasting assembly 16, a handle 30 being provided for that purpose. Forming part of the sub frame 18 is a block 32 which accommodates, side by side, four push rods 34 for sliding movement transversely of the bottom of a last carried by the shoe support 10. Each push rod 34 carries a block 36 carrying a pivot pin 38 on which two levers 40 are pivotally supported. Each lever 40 supports a further pivot pin 42 carrying an arm 44 on which a lasting element 46 is supported by a pivot pin 48. Each side lasting assembly 16 thus comprises eight such lasting elements.Each element 46 is urged anti clockwise viewing Figure 2 by a spring 50 and has a flat pressure applying surface 52 with a rounded end. Four piston and cylinder arrangements 66 act, each.on two associated levers 40, each being carried by a bracket 68 carried on a mounting 70 secured to its associated push rod 34. The levers 40 of each pair are connected by a compensating arrangement to a link 92 itself connected to a piston rod 90 of its associated arrangement 66. The levers 40 are thus pivoted independently each about their pin 38, to a limit determined by a stop pin 94. Also mounted in the block 32 are four further pushrods 80, each of which carries a plate 78 supporting a Cshaped bracket 74. Each bracket 74 carries a pivot pin 136 on which is freely pivotable a clamp pad 72, one pad thus being associated with each pair of lasting elements 46. Each clamp pad has generally the shape of an inverted L.Thus it has a vertical operating surface portion 72a at the upper end thereof, and therebeneath a further operating surface portion 72b inclined at some 400 to the vertical.In this way, the portion 72a can be used to engage a substantially vertical last wall portion, in the operation of the machine, while the inclined lower portion 72b ensures that fouling on a significantly inclined last wall portion is avoided. Each pad 72 can pivot about its pin 136, the pads being shaped so as to avoid binding on one another during pivoting. In addition, each pad 72 can move heightwise on its pin 136 through a distance limited by the bracket 74 a distance of 6mm has proved satisfactory. A light spring 140, captive on the pin 136, urges the pad to its lowermost position. In the embodiment shown in Figure 2, each pin 136 lies in a first plane extending transversely of the shoe bottom and also in a second plane extending lengthwise of the shoe bottom and normal to the first plane. In the embodiment shown in Figure 5, on the other hand, each pin 136, while also lying in the first, transverse, plane, lies in a second, lengthwise, plane inclined at some 300 to the first plane. In this way the pin 136.can be more closely disposed adjacent the clamping surface of its.pad 72. Also in the embodiment shown in Figure 5, instead of being slidable on its pin as aforesaid, each pad may be held against sliding in its bracket and instead the bracket 74 itself may slide, being mounted on its plate 78 by a pin 79 and slot 81 connection for this purpose. A spring 83 is provided for urging the bracket, and thus its pad, into its lowermost position. For moving the clamp pads 72 inwardly towards the shoe support, four piston and cylinder arrangements 84 are mounted on the sub frame 18, each having a piston rod 82 connected to the push rod 80 through a block 96 which, in the rest condition of the machine, also engages a depending portion of its associated block 36. Thus, each piston and cylinder arrangement 84 also serves to move the pair of wiping elements 46 associated therewith inwardly also. Locking means is provided to lock each pushrod 80 in position, said locking means comprising an apertured plate 98 through a restricted aperture 100 of which passes the push rod 80. Each plate 98 is pivoted at 104 and is urged by a spring 106 into a locking position in which the aperture 100 binds on the push rod 80. For releasing the lock, a bar 108 pivoted on the block 32 carries four adjustable stop screws 110 each of which can engage with one of the plates 98. For pivoting the bar 108 a piston and cylinder arrangement 112 acts through a link 114 connecting the piston rod 116 thereof with said bar. Each block 96 also supports, by a bracket 118, a piston and cylinder arrangement 56 a piston rod 58 of which is connected, through a lever 60 pivoted, intermediate its length, on its associated push rod 80 , to the mounting 70 on its associated push rod 34, for purposes to be hereinafter described. The machine also comprises lasting band means comprising a plurality of bands 128, one associated with each lasting element 46. The bands are clamped by plates 130 to the arms 44 supporting the lasting elements 46.Each band extends over the inwardly facing end face of its associated lasting element 46. The bands also extend, in pairs, side by side over the inwardly facing face of the clamp pad 72 associated therewith. Each band is tensioned by springs 132 mounted on a bracket 134 on the plate 78. The machine also comprises adhesive applying means, comprising two nozzles Figure 4 outlet ports of which are arranged at the sides thereof, spaced from their lowermost ends, in order to enable adhesive to be applied to the upstanding lasting marginal portions of an upper carried on the shoe support 10. Each nozzle 142 is carried on a block 144, incorporating a melt chamber, adhesive being supplied to the melt chamber in solid rod form in a conventional manner. The rod feed also controls, as is conventional, the amount of adhesive to be supplied in a cycle of operation. Each block 144 is clamped by a bracket 146 on a support plate 148, each plate being mounted for pivotal movement about a pivot pin 150, and the two pivot pins being carried by a nozzle support plate 152.For effective pivotal movement of the plates 148, and thus of the nozzles 142, about the pins 150, upper ends of the plates 148 have connected therebetween a piston and cylinder arrangement 154, the cylinder of said arrangement being connected to one plate and a piston rod 156 thereof being connected to the other. The nozzles 142 can thus be moved, effectively towards and away from the upstanding lasting margin of a shoe upper mounted on the shoe support 10, independently of one another, under the action of the pistonand cylinder arrangement 154. For determining an initial, inwardly directed, rest position of the two nozzles 142, stop pins 158 are carried on lugs 160 depending from the platas 148, the pins being arranged to engage with a stop pin 162 mounted on the support plate 152. The support plate 152 is carried at the forward end of two rods 164, which extend lengthwise of the machine and are mounted, towards the rear end thereof, on a pivotal axis extending widthwise of the machine. In this way, the support plate, and thus the adhesive applying means bodily, can be moved vertically heightwise of the shoe support 10. For enabling heightwise movement of the rods 164 to take place, slots 166 are provided in a main frame portion of the machine. For determining the position of the support plate 152, and thus of the nozzles 142, in relation to a shoe bottom being operated upon, extending downwardly from the support plate 152 is a carrier arm 168, on the lower end of which is mounted a shoe bottom engaging member in a form of a skid 170. The skid 170 carries a small roller 172 which runs along the shoe bottom. The skid 170 is mounted on the carrier 168 for heightwise adjusting movement by means of a pin and slot connection generally designated 174. It will thus be appreciated that, by varying the position of the skid 170 heightwise in relation to the support plate 152, the position of the nozzles 142 can be varied heightwise in relation to the shoe bottom.Such an adjustment may be required to accommodate different sizes of lasting margin on the upper to be lasted. In the operation ofsthe machine, when in a rest condition the lasting elements, under the action of their associated cylinders 66, are in a first, raised, condition in which they are spaced above the plane of the last bottom in addition, the lasting elements and the clamp pads 72, are in a retracted position see Figure 2 . When a shoe to be operated upon has been placed on the last support 10, piston and cylinder arrangements 84 are actuated to cause the clamp pads, and thus the lasting elements 46 therewith, to be moved inwardly towards the last support until the clamp pads, independently of one another, are pressing their associated bands 128 into contact with the shoe upper.As the clamp pads are moved into pressing engagement with the bands as aforesaid they are free to pivot, independently of one another, each about the axis of its pin 136, so that the surface of each pad, through which surface pressure is applied as aforesaid, engages, over substantially the whole of its width, its associated bands.The pressure applied by the pads is in the order of 1.4 kgf sq. cm. 20 lbs. sq. in. . Furthermore, as the clamp pads are moved into pressing engagement as aforesaid, where the wall of the last thus engaged is substantially vertical see Figure 3, right hand side , the clamp pad 72 will remain in its lowermost position, since no force having a heightwise component will be applied thereto. Where, on the other hand, the last wall portion being engaged is significantly inclined to be vertical see Figure 3, left hand side , the reactive force applied to the pad 72 will include a significant heightwise component, so that the left hand clamp pad 72 will move upwardly to the limit determined by the upper leg of the C shaped bracket 74 or by the pin 78 and slot 81 connection, as the case may be . With the upper thus clamped, the piston andcylinder arrangement 112 is de actuated and the clamp pads are locked in said position. At this stage, the lasting elements 46 are still in their first raised, condition.The adhesive applying means is then actuated to bring the nozzles 142 from a raised, out of the way position, downwardly into engagement with the shoe bottom, towards the heelward end thereof, such lowering taking place while the nozzles are adjacent to one another, as determined by engagement of the pins 158 with the stop pin 162. The heightwise position of the nozzles is of course determined by the skid 170.The nozzles 142 are then moved outwardly, under the action of piston and cylinder.arrangement 154, until they engage the upstanding lasting margin of the shoe, whereupon extrusion of cement through the nozzles 142 is initiated.and also relative lengthwise movement is effected by any conventional means between the shoe support 10 and the adhesive applying means, so that the nozzles are caused to track progressively along the shoe bottom, applying adhesive to the upstanding lasting marginal portions of the upper. In certain cases, it has been found that the nozzles, as they track as aforesaid, may foul on the most toewardly disposed bands 128, in the case of shoes of certain shapes. In order to overcome this problem, the machine also comprises operator actuatable selector means by which the most toewardly disposed clamped member of each side lasting assembly, together with its associated band portion 128 and lasting elements 46, is moved inwardly subsequent to the application of adhesive as aforesaid.Furthermore, because the machine is intended to operate over a wide range of shoe sizes, the selector means may also be utilized for rendering inoperative one or more of the more toewardly disposed clamp members 72, together with their lasting bands 128 and lasting elements 46, in order to accommodate different shoe sizes. Where the selector means is used for this purpose, control means of the machine ensures that, however many clamp pads and associated parts are operative, the most toewardly disposed clamp member and its associated parts, of those which are operative, will be withheld from inward movement as aforesaid until after the application of adhesive has taken place. After all the clamp pads 72 have been moved into clamping engagement as aforesaid, the piston and cylinder arrangements 56 are actuated whereupon, through their associated levers 60, the pivots of which on the push rods 80 are now stationary, the push rods 34, and thus the lasting elements 46, are moved inwardly relative to the clamp pads, to a limit determined by engagement of the block 36 with the plate 78 the amount of such movement is preferably of the order of 50mm. At the same time pistonand cylinder arrangements 66 are actuated to cause the lasting elements 46 to be moved downwardly to a second, operative, condition in which the pressure applying surface 52 of each element 46 can engage the shoe through its associated band 128. The effect of the inward and downward movement of the lasting elements 46 is to cause the bands 128 to be drawn heightwise relative to the pads 72 and about the featherline region of the shoe. To this end, the pressure applied by the pads is sufficient to hold the bands in pressing engagement with the upper while allowing such slippage to take place, and further the surface of each band engaging the upper is such that it can apply a frictional drafting force to the upper while the surface of the pad 72 is coated with a low friction coating, e.g.polytetrafluoroethylene, so that the band can readily slip relative thereto. When all the lasting elements 46 have reached their second condition, in pressing engagement with the shoe bottom, a bedding pressure is applied thereby to the wiped over lasting marginal portions of the upper, via piston and cylinder arrangements 66. When bedding pressure is applied, the locking means is released, which is effective to cause the clamp members 72 to be withdrawn slightly, thereby discontinuing their pressing of the bands against the upper. In this way, the bands 128 and clamp members 72 do not interfere with the application of bedding pressure to the shoe bottom. It will be appreciated that, because of the ability of the c lamp pads 72 to slide heightwise in the bracket 74, and further since such heightwise movement will only take place according to the contour of the last wall portion being engaged by the pad, the pads can accommodate themselves to left or right shoes without the need for any left right switching arrangement.
