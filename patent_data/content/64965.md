## Claims
CLAIM Arm support adapted to be stationarily mounted on a wall or the like adjacent a lavatory and comprising a wall attachment 10, 12 and, pivotally mounted at 20 thereon, an arm support structure comprising in a lowered position an upper arm portion 2, 3 , a lower arm portion 4 and portions 6, 23 connecting said arm portions, c h a r a c t e r i z e d by a latching structure comprising latching recesses 13 in the wall attachment 12 and shiftable latches 14 movably mounted at the upper arm portion 2 of the arm support 1 , a return spring 21 urging the latches 14 towards latching position, said latches 14 being controllable via a link structure 22, 16, 17 by means of a sturdy operating handle 19 enabling even persons of reduced muscular strength to operate the arm support between the raised latched and the lowered free positions, said lower arm portion 4 being provided with a grip 5 which in the raised latched position of the arm support forms a handle having good gripping properties.

## Description
LAVATORY ARM SUPPORTThe invention relates to a lavatory arm support and is specifically directed to an arm support for persons of reduced mobility or considerably reduced muscular strength needing a strong and reliable arm support which at the same time is simple to operate between a raised position in which the arm support is securely latched against lowering and a lowered position.Nowadays certain lavatories are required to be equiped in a w ay fascilitating use by physically afflicted persons, which means that an arm support is to be provided laterally of the lavatory. As provided now such arm supports have certain drawbacks such as insecure attachment, uncomfortable support surface, excessive distance to toilet paper holder, the latching structure, in particular, not being sufficiently strong to enable the arm support to form a steady hand grip for men during urination, said latch structure also in many cases being difficult to operate in particular for persons having reduced muscular strength. It is the purpose of the present invention to eliminate the ahove mentioned disadvantages in connection with l atory arm supports, the invention providing an arm sport having a very steady attachment, a comfortable purport surface, a toilet paper holder at a comfortable distance and in particular a latch structure of great strength which at the same time is extremely easily operated also by persons of reduced muscular strength. The specific characteristic festures of the invention appedr from tile attached claims. A particularly advantageous embodiment of the invention will be described hereafter by reference to the attached drawings in whichFig. 1 is a perspective view showing the arm support according to the invention, andFig. 2 is a side elevation of the embodiment according toFig. 1 with certain invisible portions illustrated by broken lines.The lavatory arm support 1 comprises an upper steel tube 2 on which a support surface 3 is mounted. The support surface 3 is both wide and soft offering a very comfortable support surface for the arm. A lower steel tube 4 extends forwardly from the attachment 10 and a handle portion 5 with good gripping properties is provided below the support surface 3. A transverse portion 6 connects the lower and upper tubes with each other, the lower tube 4 comprising a forwardly extending portion 8 adapted to serve as a center support for a toilet paper roll to be supported in toilet paper holder 7. At its free end tube 4 is terminated by a terminal socket 9.The attachment comprises two rear mounting plates 10 in which mounting screw holes 11 are provided. In addition, the attachment has two perpendicular mounting flanges 12, in which the tube construction constituting the arm support 1 is pivotally supported as at 20. In the lowered position the arm support abuts against the attachment wall at a downwardly directed portion 23 extending from the pivot 20 to the lower tube 4 and suitably forming a part of this tube . The mounting flanges 12 of the attachment are provided with latching recesses 13. The latching structure is attached to the upper tube 2 by means of a mounting device 15. Latches 14 are provided on a shiftable stud 22 slidahly mounted in the mounting structure 15. Stud 22 at its opposite end is attached to a link structure 16, 17, the links of which are attached to each other and extend at an angle to each other. Link 17 is adapted to swing about a pivot 18 and is connected to a strong operating handle 19. The mounting device 15 also comprises a return spring 21 adapted to urge the latch towards latching position.In the drawings the preferred embodiment is shown in the lower position. To raise the device to the substantially vertical position in which the arm support is moved apart in order to increase the free space around the lavatory and to serve as a handle during a man s urination the arm support is simply pivoted about pivot 20 causing the latches 14 to enter into the latching recesses 13 after passage over the bewelled edge surface to be retained there under the action of spring 21 cp. Fig. 2 . In this position the arm support will constitute a very stable handle. If subsequently the arm support 1 is to be lowered, the user simply grasps the very strong operating handle 19 which by a grasping movement is moved towards the gripping portion 5 to release latching device 14, 13 from the latched state enabling the arm support to be easily lowered. The wide and soft support surface 3 forms a comfortable support surface for the user, the gripping handle 5 forms a steady handle in the raised position, and the latching structure operated by the large operating handle 19 is easily actuated also by persons of reduced muscular strength. By providing the toilet paper holder 7 on the arm support proper the user has easy acess to the toiletpaper and due to the steady construction the invention provides a reliable arm support satisfying the abovementioned purposes of the invention0 The expert on the field will realize that the invention can be modified and varied within the frame of the attached claims broadly defining the invention.
