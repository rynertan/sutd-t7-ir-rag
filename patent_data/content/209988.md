# Improved process for the removal of H2S from geothermal steamand a composition comprising iron chelate and a cationic polymer.

## Abstract
Process for removing H₂S from the exhaust steam in a geothermal power plant wherein the H₂S containing steam is contacted with an aqueous solution containing a ferric chelate and a cationic polymeric catalyst such as poly dimethyldiallyl ammonium chloride . The conversion of H₂S to sulfur is ac celerated by the use of a small amount of the catalyst.
