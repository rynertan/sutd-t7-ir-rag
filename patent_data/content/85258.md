# Combustion chamber arrangements in internal combustion engines.

## Abstract
An internal combustion engine of the spark ignited piston type has a piston crown of pent roof shape and a cylinder head combustion chamber of corresponding shape. Formed on one inclined face 22 of the combustion chamber 20 is a recess 30 of generally ovate profile, having a plane roof 32 parallel to the face 22 and having a side wall 31 perpendicular thereto. The exhaust valve port 29 opens through one end of the roof of the recess 30 and the spark plug 37 protrudes through the other end. During the compression stroke as the piston 12 approaches top dead centre, gas is displaced by the squish effect from between the approaching inclined faces 16 and 21 of the piston crown and combustion chamber roof on one side of the apex 18, 23 and travels across the combustion chamber and into the recess 30 in the other side of the roof thus producing gas movement and turbulence in the recess 30 where ignition takes place.

## Description
COMBUSTION CHAMBER ARRANGEMENTS IN I.C. ENGINES This invention relates to spark ignited reciprocatingpiston i.c. engines employing gasolene or other volatile hydrocarbon liquid as fuel, and is applicable both to fuelinjection engines and to carburettor engines, and both to engines with supercharging and to engines with normal induces aspiration. To obtain the highest possible output from an i.c.engine it is essential to obtain the highest possible volumetric efficiency and breathing capacity, up to the highest practicable operating speed. This requires the use of large valve sizes or areas. At the same time, modern engines are required to have good fuel economy and low exhaust gas emission levels of unburnt hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides. This demands the use of as high a compression ratio as possible with regard to the octane number of the fuel being used, in the interest of high thermal efficiency. The shape and arrangement of the combustion chamber and valve ports associated with each cylinder of the engine is of decisive importance in connection with these and other desiderata. The detailed layout of the combustion chamber must be as compact as is practicable, and disposed in such a way that a high swirl and or squish can be obtained, so as to create a relatively high gas turbulence to assist combustion particularly when operating at high air fuel ratios weak mixtures , in the interest of low N exhaust emissions and good fuel economy. The present invention is concerned with providing certain novel combustion chamber configurations which will make possible improved results in some or all of these respects. The invention in its widest conceptcomprises a sparkignited piston engine, having a piston crown and cylinder head combustion chamber configuration in which as the piston approaches top dead centre during its compression stroke, gaseous charge is displaced across the combustion chamber by a squish effect from between approaching opposed faces of the piston crown and combustion chamber roof, respectively, on one side of the chamber into an open recess formed in the roof of the combustion chamber on the other side thereof, the spark ignition taking place in the recess. The term tsquish is a known term in the art, which is used to refer to the displacement of a flow of gaseous charge from between opposed surfaces of the piston and cylinder head which approach one another very closely as the piston approaches its top dead centre position during its compression stroke, the displaced gas flow being directed into another part of the combustion chamber to create movement and turbulence of the air fuel mixture which will assist combustion and improve emissions. From another aspect, the invention comprises a sparkignited i.c. engine having a cylinder with a piston whose crown has an upper surface formed by two oppositelyinclined faces which intersect or merge at a level above that of the periphery of the crown, and having a cylinder head formed in its lower surface with a re entrant combustion chamber whose lower side is circular opening in the cylinder head coaxial with the cylinder and of substantially the same diameter, and whose overall internal shape apart from the below mentioned recess generally corresponds to the external shape of the piston crown, and whose roof is defined by two oppositely inclined faces, corresponding to and opposed to those of the piston crown, which faces intest or merge at a level above that of the lower side of the cylinder head, the engine inlet valve port or ports entering the combustion chamber through one of the said faces of the combustion chamber roof, and there being formed in the other face an open recess into which the engine exhaust valve port or ports and a spark plug aperture both open, and in which as in use the piston approaches the top dead centre position during its compression stroke its crown enters the combustion chamber and the oppositely inclined faces of the piston crown closely approach the opposed faces of the combustion chamber roof so that compressed gaseous charge will be displaced laterally from between the face of the combustion chamber roof containing the inlet port s and the opposed face of the piston crown by the squish effect in a fltv which will enter the recess in the other face of the combustion chamber. It is to be understood that terms such as upper lower , above , below , and the like are used herein to relate to the condition when the engine is orientated with the respective cylinder axis vertical, the mating face of the cylinder head horizontal, and the cylinder head disposed at the upper end of the cylinder with the crankshaft at the lower end thereof, so that the piston reciprocates vertically up and down. However such terms are not to be interpreted as limiting the invention to tis orientation in any way, since of course the engine may be mounted and operated in any practicable orientation. In a convenient arrangement, the oppositely inclined faces of the piston crown and of the roof of the combustion chamber may be plane, and may respectively intersect along parallel straight lines which are perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder, the opposed faces of the piston crown and combustion chamber roof being parallel. The inclined faces of the roof of the combustion chamber may be inclined at either equal or unequal angles to the cylinder axis, in a symmetrical or asymmetrical arrangement. The recess in the combustion chamber roof is preferably elongate, to accommodate a single exhaust valve port and a spark plug aperture spaced along its major axis. It may have a plane roof, preferably parallel to the inclined face of the combustion chamber in which it is formed. It may have its entire side wall disposed perpendicularly to that face, and in a preferred arrangement its intersection with that face may have a generally ovate profile. It will be understood that as the piston approaches the top dead centre position during the latter part of its compression stroke, air or fuel air mixture located between the inclined face of the combustion chamber roof which contains the inlet valve s and the opposed face of the piston crown wall will be squeezed by the rising piston between these faces and will be displaced by the well known squish effect in a laterally moving flow out from between these approaching faces and across the combustion chamber, and this flow of displaced gas will enter the recess in the other inclined face of the chamber to set up gas movement and turbulence therein below the exhaust valve and in the vicinity of the spark plug electrodes, with beneficial effects upon ignition and combustion. Should it be required to alter the angle at which the squish gas flow enters and or travels within the recess, to an angle more parallel to the inclined face of the cylinder head in which the recess is formed, various modifications of the combustion chamber or piston crown may be made. One such modification is a lip formed along the edge of the recess in the combustion chamber roof nearest to the junction of the inclined faces of the roof, the lip being immediately adjacent to the face containing the recess and projecting into the interior of the recess as an overhang to deflect the ,squish flow downwardly. Another modification for the same purpose is an open groove formed in the face of the combustion chamber roof which contains the recess, the groove extending close toand along the length of the edge of the recess nearest to the junction of the oppositely inclined faces. The invention may be carried into effect in various ways, but certain specific embodiments thereof will now be described by way of example only and with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a view, in section on the line A A in Figure 5, showing the upper part of one cylinder and the cylinder head of a piston engine, which may be either a single cylinder engine or a multi cylinder engine. Figure 2 is a view on the arrow X in Figure 1 showing part of the roof of the combustion chamber from below, Figure 3 is a view in section on the line D D in Figure 1 through the axes of the inlet valves, Figure 4 is a view in section on the line E E of Figure 1 through the exhaust valve axis, Figure 5 is a sectional plan taken on the line C C in Figure 1, in the case of the single cylinder head, Figure 6 is a sectional elevation on the line B B in Figure 5 through the axis of the spark plug, Figure 7 is a sectional elevation on the line F F in Figure 1, in a plane of section through the cylinder axis, Figure 8 is a sectional plan similar to Figure 5 showing a first modification of the arrangement ofFigures 1 to 7, Figure 9 is a section on the line B B of Figure 8, similar to Figure 6, Figure 10 is a view similar to Figure 8 showing a second modification of the arrangement of Figures 1 to 7, Figure 11 is a section on the line B B of Figure 10, similar to Figure 6, Figure 12 is a diagrammatic elevation of another embodiment in which the inlet and exhuast valve stem axes are equally and oppositely inclined to the cylinder axis but the junction line at the apex of the combustion chamber roof is offset from the cylinder axis, and Figure 13 is a view similar to Figure 12 of another asymmetrical embodiment in which the valve stem axes are unequally inclined to the cylinder axis. Figures 1 to 7 show the upper part of the bore of the, or one, cylinder 10 and the cylinder head 11 of a single cylinder or of a multi cylinder spark ignited gasolene engine of piston type, the respective piston being shown in part at 12. Figure 5 shows the singlecylinder version, but in the case of a multi cylinder head Figure 5 would be amended simply by the removal of the closure metal at the top and bottom of the Figure as drawn, and the extension of the left and right hand faces with appropriate ports to suit the number of cylinders involved. Similar remarks apply to Figures 8 and 10. The axis 13 of the cylinder 10 is shown as vertical in Figures 1 to 7 with the lower face 14 of the cylinder head 11 horizontal. The piston crown 15 projects upwardly, having a known pent roof form, its upper surface being defined by two plane faces 16 and 17 which intersect in a horizontal apex line 18 passing diametrally through the axis of the piston at the top of the crown. The two plane surfaces 16 and 17 are downwardly inclined from the apex line 18 at equal and opposite acute angles, subtending between themselves an included angle less than 1800. The side surfaces of the piston crown which intersect the oppositely inclined plane faces on either side of the piston are part cylindrical. The underside of the cylinder head 11 is formed, for the or each cylinder 10, with a circular profiled re entrant recess 20, coaxial with the cylinder bore, which recess constitutes a main part of the combustion chamber for that cylinder at top dead centre, and whose interior has a shape which generally matches that of the piston crown so that the latter can enter the combustion chamber into close proximity with most of its roof as the piston moves to its top dead centre position. Thus the roof of the combustion chamber is also formed by two downwardly inclined plane faces 21 and 22 which extend parallel to the respective faces 16 and 17 and intersect at an apex line 23 which is parallel to and just above the apex line 18.At top dead centre the plane faces 16 and 17 of the piston crown lie very close to the opposed plane faces 21 and 22 of the cylinder head combustion chamber. The cylinder head has poppet type inlet and exhaust valves 25 and 28, and the axes of the valve stems 25A and 26A are perpendicular to the respective plane faces 21 and 22.The cylinder head has twin inlet valves 25 per cylinder as showe in Figure 3, whose valve seatings surround circular apertures formed side by side in the inclined face 21 of the combustion chamber recess 20. The two ducts 26 of the inlet valve ports 27 are cast in the cylinder head asoshown in Figures 1 and 5. A single exhaust valve 28 is used per cylinder, and its exhaust port 29 opens into a recess 30 formed in the cylinder head 11 with its bottom opening through the other plane face 22 of the combustion chamber, the profile of its intersection with that face being generally ovate as shown at 31 inFigure 2. The recess 30 has a plane roof 32 which lies parallel to the face 22, and has a circumferential side wall 33 generated by straight lines perpendicular to the roof 32 and face 22. The major axis of the elongate recess 30 extends generally parallel to the apex line 23, as shown inFigure 2. The exhaust valve port 29 opens into the larger end of the roof of the ovate recess 30, as shown in Figure 2, and its exhaust duct 35 formed in the cylinder head casting extends away from the port 29 as shown in Figures 1 and 5.A tapped bore 36 in the cylinder head for a spar plug 37 opens into the smaller end of the roof of the ovate recess 30, as shown in Figures 2 and 6, so that the electro of the spark plug 37 lie approximately at the level of the roof 32. It will be appreciated that, as indicated by Figure 7, the cylinder head recess 20 and the crown of the piston 12 are planar in sections at right angles to Figure 1, so defining the plane inclined faces 21, 22 and 16, 17.The twin inlet valves 25, which are used to give good breathing at high speeds, are inclined to the cylinder axis at the same angle as but oppositely to the single exhaust valve 28, whose port 29 has a larger diameter than the twfl inlet ports 27. The axes of the inlet and exhaust valves are perpendicular to the respective faces 21 and 22, and 0 are inclined at 30 or less to the cylinder axis. The valve are operated by means of twin overhead camshafts, not shown.However, with some relocation of the spark plug bore 36, a single central overhead camshaft with fingers or rockers to transmit the cam lifts to the valves could alternatively be employed. The inlet ducts 26 of the two inlet valves are separate but diverge from the two closely adjacent circular section entry holes at the cylinder head entry face, so that a single elongate inlet manifold branch can feed these two entries for the or each cylinder.It is possible to have a single entry at the cylinder head entry face, with the bifurcation of the two inlet ports taking place within the head structure if required If the height of the redess 30 in the plane face 22 of the combustion chamber is h, measured perpendicularly from the face 22 to the roof 32, and being of necessity at least equal to the exhaust valve lift plus the valve head disc thickness, and if the internal length of the recess 30 along its longer axis is L, then the ratio L h should be within the range 2.7 1 to 4.3 1. It is important that the detailed motion of the gaseous air fuel mixture induced into the combustion chamber through the inlet valves, and there compressed by the piston, should at around top dead centre be suitably controlled to facilitate orderly and rapid combustion when a spark occurs at the points of the spark plug, whose energisation is provided for and timed in any orthodox manner.An important factor for obtaining the required charge movement and turbulence is the so called squish previously referred to, namely the gas motion which occurs transversely at one edge of the main combustion space as air or air fuel mixture is compressed within the cylinder between the approaching faces of the piston crown and the combustion chamber in the head, due to the very small vertical clearance between the piston crown and the roof of the combustion chamber which with good production tolerances can be as low as 1 of the piston stroke.In the illustrated construction, the gas is displaced, as the piston rises, from the left hand side of the combustion space as shown in Figure 1, i.e. from between the opposed faces 16 and 21 and under the inlet valves, and will tend to be projected towards the right in that Figure, into the clearance volume provided under the exhaust valve within the recess 30. The precise orientation of the squish gas projection into the recess 30 depends on the geometry, and should be optimised by trial and error to provide good combustion over a wide range of mixture strengths. If it is required to alter the direction at which squish gas is projected from between the faces 16 and 21 into the combustion chamber 30, to a smaller angle with respect to the faces 17 and 22, various expedients are possible.One such expedient is shown in Figures 8 and 9 in which an integral lip 50 is formed along the edge of the recess 30 nearest to the apex line 23, the lip being located next to the inclined face 22 and projecting laterally into the recess 30. In Figure 8 the ovate broken line 30 shows the outline of the bottom of the recess 30 whilst the inner broken line 50 shows the position of the edge of the lip 50. The lip 50 will have the effect of deflecting the squish gas flow to a shallower angle.The lip must have a reasonably substantial section to avoid overheating with the risk of causing pre ignition. Another such expedient is shown in Figures 10 and 11, in which a groove is cast or machined in the inclined face 22 next to the apex line 23 and between it and the adjacent edge of the recess 30. In Figure 10 the ovate broken line 20 shows the outline of the bottom of the recess 30 whilst the broken loop line 51 shows the position of the groove 51, which as indicated curves around to follow the profile of the recess at each end. The groove 51 will intercept the flow of squish gas from between the faces 16 and 21, since the groove is virtually at the apex 23 of the cylinder head recess 20 and will cause the squish11 gas flow to be deflected downwardly. In all the embodiments so far described and illustrated the piston 12 and cylinder head combustion chamber 20 have been of the pent roof form with two equally inclined flat surfaces on each, so that the apex of the piston crown and that of the circular recess 20 are both straight lines passing through the central axis 13 of the cylinder and the central axis of the piston which is treated as coincidental with the cylinder axis 13. However this is not essential.Figure 12 shows diagrammatically a possible embodiment in which the piston crown and the cylinder head are asymmetrical, their horizontal apex lines at the intersections of their oppositely inclined faces 16A, 17A and 21A, 22A respectively being offset from the cylinder axis 13, but the axes of the inlet valve stems 25A and the axis of the exhaust valve stem 28A are equally inclined at 0 for example 30 to the cylinder axis 13. Thus the faces 16A and 21A are oppositely inclined to the axis 13 at the 0 same angle, 60 , as the faces 17A and 22A, but meet the side wall of the piston at different levels. In Figure 13 there is shown diagrammatically another layout in which the axes of the inlet and exhaust valve stems 25B, 28B are respectively inclined at different angles d andss to the cylinder axis 13. The inclined faces 21B and 22B are still perpendicular to the respective associated valve stem axes, but they slant from a common level at the cylinder head face 14, and intersect asymmetrically at an offset apex line 23B.The faces 16B and 17B of the piston crown are parallel to the faces 21B and 22B respectively, and are similarly arranged, i.e. asymmetrically at different inclinations. Moreover it is not essential that the two oppositely inclined plane faces of the pentroof piston crown, and those of the combustion chaitiber be flat, and it is to be understood that the invention may be utilised in conjunction with variants of this basic pent roof shape. For example each pair of oppositely inclined faces might be nonplanar, e.g. shallow convex or concave surfaces each having a large radius of curvature about one axis or two intersecting axes, e.g. part cylindrical or even partspherical, these curved surfaces either intersecting at the apex or ridge of the pent roof, or even merging smoothly into one another at the apex so as to form a shallow part cylindrical or part spherical domed roof for the piston and similarly for the combustion chamber. All these and other variations of the basic pentroof piston and combustion chamber shape are to be regarded as being within the scope of the invention and of the following claims.
