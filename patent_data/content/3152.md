# Battery back up system for a data processor.

## Abstract
A battery backup system provides DC power to a data processing system in the event of an AC power failure. A preferred embodiment supplies DC power from a plurality of series connected batteries at a voltage level sufficient to operate a data processor. After a time delay, the batteries are connected in parallel to provide DC power at a lower voltage level sufficient to maintain information stored in a memory.
