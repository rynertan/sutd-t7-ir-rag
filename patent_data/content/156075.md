# RELEASABLE CONNECTOR FOR OPTICAL FIBERS

## Abstract
A fiber holder is received within one connector part of a plug and receptacle connector including a plug shell and a receptacle shell. A coupling ring carried by the plug shell is rotatable to drive the plug and receptacle together or apart depending upon the direction of rotation. The other connector part includes an alignment sleeve within which a second fiber holder is located along with the first fiber holder. When the two connector parts are mated, closing rotation of the coupling ring pulls the two sets of fiber holders into the alignment sleeve end locates the fiber ends in a slightly spaced relation. On proper disposition of the fiber ends, a detent spring located within the plug housing has end projec tions which snap into recesses signifying both tactilely and aurally that a proper optical signal passing interconnection has been achieved.
