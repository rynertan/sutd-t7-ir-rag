## Description
Double acting hydraulic shock absorber with controlled compression cycle for vehicles.A known type of double acting shock absorber, is shown schematically in Figure 1. It comprises a general body portion in which there is formed a cylinder 1 and an annular reservoir 2 around the cylinder. A piston 3 is slidable within the cylinder and the piston rod 4 thereof projects through one end of the body portion of the shock absorber the piston rod is pivotally connected by means of the eye member 5 to a fixed point of the body of the vehicle, and a similar eye member 6 which forms part of the opposite end of the body portion of the shock absorber permits the latter to be connected to the corresponding component of the suspension.The piston 3 has ducts 7 and 8 which form a communication between the two chambers that the piston 3 forms in the cylinder, and which each carry valve means not shown which open in opposite directions to permit the transfer of damper fluid between the chambers under a given resistance in each case. Disposed at the base of the cylinder 1 is a valve arrangement which has ducts 9 and 10 which form a communication for the lower chamber of the cylinder to the annular reservoir 2, the first thereof having a valve 11 which opens towards the chamber and the second having a valve 12 which opens towards the reservoir.Thus, when the piston 3 moves downwardly in the cylinder 1 the vehicle is moving towards the road a part of the hydraulic fluid in the lower chamber flows to the upper chamber through one of the ducts in the piston, and the remainder flows to the annular reservoir 2, lifting the valve 12 which is calibrated to produce the appropriate resistance when the piston moves upwardly within the cylinder the suspension recovers , the hydraulic fluid in the upper chamber flows to the lower chamber, the lower chamber being filled up by means of an additional amount of fluid corresponding to the volume displaced by the piston rod 4 from the reservoir 2, thereby lifting the valve 11 which in turn is resiliently loaded to afford a respective resistance.It is known that in double acting shock absorbers as described above the resist once in the compression mode when the piston is moving downwardly in the cylinder is the parameter which has the greatest influences upon the performance of the suspension of the vehicle, and that that resistance has to be increased in proportion to increasing speed of movement of the vehicle.Accordingly, if a shock absorber has been designed to provide a suitable performance at high speeds, the suspension is then excessively hard and uncomfortable at lower speeds similarly, shock absorbers which are designed for ordinary commercially available vehicles are inadequate to provide the high levels of services and security at competition speeds.Accordingly, efforts have been made to improve the known shock absorbers of that kind, by providing them with at least two separate modes of resistance in compression in order that they can operate adequately both in low speed ranges and in hig speed ranges, and likewise on different kinds of road surface.Thus for example, in US patent No. 4 031 989 which relates to the construction illustrated in Figure 1 it is proposed that, in parallel with the valve 12 which affords a high level of resistance in compression, the shock absorber also has an additional duct 13 which is closed by a valve 14 which has a low level of resistance in compression its resistance is lower than that afforded by the valve 12 , and by a flow valve whose closure member is formed by a disc 15 which normally closes the parallel duct 13 but which can be opened by a solenoid 16 which can be energised from the electrical system of the vehicle by way of a suitable connection or control arrangement.When the valve 15 is closed, the shock absorber operates with a high level of resistance in the compression mode hard suspension and when the valve is open, the lower level of resistance afforded to the flow of hydraulic fluid gives a softer suspension which is suitable for low speeds. However, that valve arrangement suffers from various serious disadvantages from the point of view of manufacture it is complicated in construction the various parts of which it is composed do not lend themselves readily to mechanised assembly and the worst problem is that the arrangement of the two combined valves which afford resis trance in the compression mode give rise to. problems in regard to manufacture and assembly in that it is very difficult to adjust the two valves with the required resistancesand it is virtually impossible, without means that are compatible with the production process, to achieve repeateability with such resistances within a desirable range of tolerances.Confronted with that state of the art, the present invention is concerned with a double acting hydrculic shock absorber with controlled compression cycle, in particular for automobile vehicles and of the class described hereinbefore, in other words, which comprises a valve arrangement which includes, between the lower chamber in the cylinder and the annular reservoir, one or more ducts including a valve which affords a hard resistance to compression and which opens towards the annular reservoir one or more ducts including a valve which affords resistance in the recovery mode and which opens towards the lower chamber of the cylinder, and one or more ducts which include, on the one hand, a valve which affords a soft resistance to compression, and, on the other hand, a flow valve whose closure element, which is normally closed, is actuable by a solenoid which can be energised from the electrical system of the vehicle to put the valve which affords a soft resistance to compression into operation, thereby to eliminate or substantially reduce the above mentioned problems.Thus, in accordance with the improvements of the present invention, the valve arrangement which communicates the lower chamber of the cylinder with the annular reservoir comprises an upper body portion which is fixed to the lower end of the cylinder, forming the bottom thereof, and a lower body portion which is fixed to the upper body portion in such a way as to form therewith an annular chamber communicating with the annular reservoir and an internal chamber communicating with the lower chamber of the cylinder, the upper body portion having passing therethrough ducts which communicate the lower chamber of the cylinder with the annular chamber and are associated with respective closure elements that are resiliently loaded to afford the resistances in the recovery mode and in the hard compression mode, wherein the wall of the internal chamber of the lower body portion which is more remote from the upper body portion has passing therethrough ducts which communicate same with the annular reservoir and with which there are associated, externally 4o the body portion, the closure element which affords a soft resistance to compression, and, internally, with seats for the control valve for the closure member which affords a soft resistance to compression, the solenoid of which is formed in the opposite wall of said chamber.A particularly advantageous embodiment is obtained when the upper body portion has c central aperture which is disposed upon a coaxial neck portion of the lower body portion, through which passes an axial conduit which forms a communication between the lower chamber of the cylinder and the internal chamber of the body portion, and the annular chamber is defined by pro ject ons or lugs projecting from the mutually oppositely disposed walls of the upper cnd or lower body portions.In that case, the recovery ducts may be formed around a circumferance which is adjacent to the periphery of the upper body portion, and the closure element thereof is a laminar disc which is urged against the ducts by a conical spring supported by an abutment or projection fixed to the projecting end of the coaxial neck portion of the lower body portion. In their turn, the ducts which afford c high level resistance in the compression mode may be distributed count c circumference which is adjacent to the central aperture of the upper body portion and the closure member thereof is c resilient metal plate or disc which is fitted on to the coaxial neck portion of the upper body portion and which is engaged by means of its edge against an annular seat which extends around said ducts, by means of a resilient conical disc or plate trapped between the lower body portion and the central part of the closure plate.Preferably, the lower body portion comprises an upper ferromagnetic member, the coaxial neck portion extending from the upper surface thereof while the lower surface thereof has an annular groove which defines a housing for the coil of the solenoid, the edges thereof forming the pole pieces thereof and a mounting seat for a non magnetic bowl shaped member which defines the internal chamber in said body potion and the lower wall portion of the chamber.The ducts which afford a low level of resistancein the compression mode may be formed at a circumference which is concentric to the non magnetic member and the low resistance closure member may be formed by a disc or plate of resilient metal which is fixed centrally by clinching or riveting a stub portion which projects centrally from the outward surface of said member, or a rivet which is fitted in place, in such a way that the edge thereof bears with the desired preloading against an annular seat which extends around the ducts.Two annular ribs which are disposed on both sides of the cir cumferential series of low resistance ducts form a valve seat for a ferromagnetic closure disc or plate which is movable axially within the chamber in the lower body portion and which completes the magnetic circuit of the solenoid and which is urged resiliently against the seating ribs.The accompanying drawings show diagrammatic views of a preferred embodiment of the invention by way of example thereof without limiting the scope of the invention and, for comparative purposes, a diagrammatic view of a conventional doubleacting shock absorber. Figure 1 is a diagrammatic view in longitudinal section of a double acting shock absorber in accordance with the prior art and as described hereinbefore Figure 2 shows an axial section on a larger scale of a valve arrangement which incorporates the improvements of the present invention and which can be used in a shock absorber of the type shown in Figure 1 Figure 3 is a partial axial section corresponding to Figure 2 and shows the mode of operation of the closure member which affords a high level of resistance in the compression mode,Figure 4 is an equivalent view to Figure 3, showing the mode of operation of the recovery closure member andFigure 5 is an axial section of the valve arrangement according to Figure 2 showing the operating position of the closure member which affords a low level of resistance in the compression mode.Figure 2 shows the cylinder 1 within which the piston 3 is dis placeable, forming the lower chamber 17, and the body portion 18 of the shock absorber which, with the cylinder 1, forms the annular reservoir 2 for the hydraulic fluid, communicating with the above mentioned chamber 17 by way of the valve arrangement which will be described hereinafter.The valve arrangement comprises a lower body portion which is indicated by general reference numeral 19 and formed by an upper member 20 which is provided with a downwardly directed seat 21 and into which the edge of a lower bowl shaped member 22 is fitted as a press fit and sealed with respect to the hydraulic fluid.With the member 20, the member 22 forms an internal chamber 23. The upper member 20, which is of magnetic steel, is provided in its downward surface, which faces towards the chamber 23, with an annular groove 24 which forms a housing for a solenoid coil 25 which is locked in position by means of a lining 26 of suitable synthetic resin, and which can be energised in conventional manner by conductors 27. Extending upwardly from the upward surface of the member 20 is a coaxial tubular neck portion 28 having a central conduit 29 which communicates the lower chamber 17 of the cylinder with the internal chamber 23 in the lower portion 19. Press fitted on to the neck portion 28 is an upper disc shaped body portion 30, the edge of which has a peripheral seat or step 31 with which it is sealingly fitted to the lower edge of the cylinder 1, thus forming the bottom of the cylinder or the chamber 17 thereof. The position in which the body portion 30 is fitted with respect to the lower body portion 19 is determined by the provision of abutment fins 32 which project from the edge of the body portion 30 and which come to bear against the upward surface of the member 2D, forming between the two body portions an annular chamber 33 which, as will be appreciated, comzunicotes directly with the annular reservoir 2.Extending longitudinally through the disc like body portion 30 is a series of holes which are disposed in two groups thereof, as indicated at 34 and 35, being disposed on two circumferences which are concentric with the axis Z Z of the arrcnge ment, in such a way that all the holes are capable of forming a communication between the reservoir 2 and the chamber 17. The holes 34 of the outward array thereof constitute the recovery or return ducts through which the hydraulic fluid contained in the nular reservoir 2 flows to the lower chamber 17 of the shock absorber cylinder while the piston 13 is moving upwardly.The upper openings of the holes 34 are developed in the form of valve seats and applied thereto, so as to close same, is a sure element 36 in the form of an annular disc of thin met plate, the central opening of which leaves a passage completely free for the other holes 35. The loading required to produce the damping resistance in the recovery cycle is produced by means of a conical spring 37 which is compressed between the disc member 36 and an abutment circlip 38 which fits into a corresponding groove in the end of the neck portion 28.On the other hand, in the annular chamber 33, the openings of the holes 35 are surrounded by an annular rib which forms a valve seat 39 for the edge of steel plate which forms the closure element 40 that affords the hard compression resistance in the compression cycle in operation of the shock absorber. The closure element 40 is fixed in position by means of a conical disc or plate 41 which, in the assembled condition, is trapped between the closure element 40 and the upper surface of the member 20.In the lower body portion 198 the base of the lower member 22 has passing therethrough a circumferential array of holes 42 which form the ducts for generating the soft resistance in the compression cycle, and for that purpose, the lower openings thereof are contained within an annular rib 43 which forms a valve seat for a closure plate or disc 44 having a central opening which fits on to a step 45 of a projecting stub portion 46 and is fixed in position by clinching or riveting the edges of the portion 46, as indicated at 47.The upper openings of the ducts 42 open within the chamber 43 between two concentric annular ribs 48 which together form the valve seat for a closure plate 49 which, in the same way as in the prior art arrangements1 constitutes the armature of the solenoid and which can be moved away from said seats when the solenoid is energised by conventional means which are not described, because they do not form part of the sub3ect matter of this invention. The plate 49 has a central opening 50 to permit the hydraulic fluid to flow therethrough, and is urged towards the rest postion shown inFigure 2 by means of a coil spring 51 housed in an enlarged portion 52 of the conduit 29. The mode of operation of the arrangement, in the course of the operating movements of the shock absorber, is identical to that of the prior art constructions of which an example is shown inFigure 1, and retains all the advantages and functional qualities to be found therein. The mode of operation of the arrangement is shown in graphic form in Figures 2 to 5 Figure 2 shows the rest condition of the shock absorber, Figure 3 shows by means of arrows the flow of hydraulic fluid during the phase involving compression against a hard resistance, Figure 4 shows the flow of fluid during the suspension recovery cycle, and Figure 5 shows in particular the flow pattern of the hydraulic fluid during the compression cycle involving a soft resistance.Study of the drawings will show the way in which the improvements of the present invention attain the proposed objectives. In fact, firstly, it is clear that the three vale which result into the three modes of operation described are totally indepen dent of each other, so that adjustment of some does not affect the others. The assembly preloading thereof may be determined accurately and consistently within a production series and all the parts of the valve arrangement, including the valves, lend themselves perfectly to automated assembly in groups and sub groups, as may be appropriate in each production situation.It will be apparent that, in accordance with the invention, any technical equivalentof the various constructional features described may be employed. For example, the clinched or riveted stub portion 46 may be replaced by a rivet that is fitted to the assembly.
