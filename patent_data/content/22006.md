# Universal joint.

## Abstract
A universal joint between a pair of members 10, 12 provides for transmitting torque between the pair of members when the pair of members are oriented at varying angles relative to each other. One of the members 10 terminates in a cavity 20 which is substantially cylindrical. The other member 12 extends into the cavity and a pair of sockets 24, 26 cooperates with the other member to secure the latter within the cavity. The pair of sockets includes outer surfaces which substantially match the wall of the cavity to enable the pair of sockets to rotate in a first plane relative to the one member. The pair of sockets include projections 34, 36 which are received in an opening on the other member to enable the other member to pivot relative to the pair of sockets and the one member in a second plane substantially perpendicular to the first plane. At least one spring clip 40 cooperates with the other member and the pair of sockets to bias the pair of sockets into engagement with the wall of the cavity. The spring clip is removable to permit the pair of sockets and the other member to be withdrawn from the cavity.
