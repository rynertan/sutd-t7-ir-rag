# Portable skate sharpener.

## Abstract
A portable skate sharpener has an elongated hollow main body having an electric motor adjacent one end, the electric motor having an output shaft extending in a longitudinal direction in the main body, and a grinding wheel mounted on the shaft for rotation in a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the main body. The main body has an aperture below the grinding wheel for receiving an upper edge of an upturned skate blade to enable a skate to be sharpened when held in an inverted position by holding the main body with one hand adjacent the motor end and another hand adjacent an opposite end of the main body and, while the motor is operating to rotate the grinding wheel, manually moving the sharpener in a direction trans verse to its length with the skate edge in the body aperture and in engagement with the grinding wheel.
