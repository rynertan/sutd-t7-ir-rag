# Audio light chandelier.

## Abstract
A chandelier having, in addition to lamps serving an illuminating purpose, an audio system, such as a stereopho nic radio or a security system, incorporated into its structure. The former furnishes, for example, music, while the latter has as its purpose to warn of unwanted intrusions and disasters, for example, such as fires, by means of stimulus responsive warning signals. Control, sensing and energizing means may be provided within a common housing. The modular construction of the device makes assembly and disassembly convenient without the use of special or any other kinds of tools.
