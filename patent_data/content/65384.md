## Description
SEPARATION PROCESS This invention relates to a process for the separation of the components of binary mixtures of penicillin derivatives. In particular, the invention relates to a process for the separation of diastereoisomers of penicillin mixtures. European Patent Publication No. 0015690 discloses inter alia a class of 6 methoxy acylamino penicillins of formula A or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or in vivo hydrolysable ester thereof EMI1.1 wherein R is C16 alkyl an optionally substituted 5membered heterocyclic ring containing one or two heteroatoms selected from oxygen, sulphur and nitrogen phenyl mono substituted phenyl where the substituent is halogen, hydroxy, C16 alkoxy, nitro, amino, C1,6 alkyl, C16 haloalkyl, Cl 6 alkylcarbonyloxy, or C16 alkyl sulphonylamino for example NHS02CH3 or di substituted phenyl where the substituents are selected from hydroxy, halogen, methoxy, acetoxy and amino. The carbon atom marked in formula A is asymmetric so that the compounds may exist as two optically active diastereoisomers. European Patent Publication No. 0 015 690 further discloses that compounds prepared from the D side chain exhibit the higher antibacterial activity. We have now found a facile process for separation of the penicillin derivatives containing the R side chain from an R, S mixture. The present process avoids the necessity to perform a resolution of the isomers of the a sulpho acetic acid derivatives prior to their coupling to the 6,ss amino 6,a substituted penicillanic acid nucleus. Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for preparing a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or in vivo hydrolysable ester thereof EMI2.1 wherein R1 is C16 alkyl an optionally substituted 5membered heterocyclic ring containing one or two heteroatoms selected from oxygen, sulphur and nitrogen or phenyl optionally substituted with up to three groups selected from halogen, hydroxy, C16 alkoxy, nitro, amino, C16 alkyl, C16 haloalkyl, C1,6 alkylcarbonyloxy, or C1 6 alkyl sulphonylamino for example NHSO2CH3 wherein the carbon atom marked is in the R configuration which process comprises inducing or allowing a crystalline precipitate of a compound of formula II EMI2.2 having R configuration at carbon atom marked , wherein R1 is as defined with respect to formula I , R is a carboxy blocking group and M is an alkali metal ion or an optionally substituted ammonium ion to separate from a solution of a mixture of compounds of formula II havingR and S configuration at carbon atom marked isolating the crystalline precipitate and where necessary, under non racemising conditions, removing the carboxy blocking group Rx and or forming a free acid, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or in vivo hydrolysable ester. The compounds produced by the process of the present invention include the pharmaceutically acceptable esters of compound I which hydrolyse readily in the human body to produce the parent acid, for example acyloxyalkyl groups such as acetoxymethyl, pivaloyloxymethyl, a acetoxyethyl, a acetoxybenzyl and a pivaloyloxymethyl groups alkoxycarbonyloxyalkyl groups, such as ethoxycarbonyloxymethyl and a ethoxycarbonyloxyethyl and lactone groups such as phthalidyl or dimethoxyphthalidyl. Suitable salts of the compound of formula I include salts of the 3 carboxylic acid group and also of the sulpho group. Salts include metal salts, eg aluminium, alkali metal salts such as sodium or potassium, alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium or magnesium, and ammonium or substituted ammonium salts, for example those with lower alkylamines such as triethylamine, hydroxylower alkylamines such as 2 hydroxyethylamine, bis 2hydroxyethyl amino or tri 2 hydroxyethyl amine, cycloalkylamines such as bicyclohexylamine, or with procaine, dibenzylamine, N,N dibenzylethylenediamine, l ephenamine,N ethylpiperidine, N benzyl B phenethylamine, dehydroabietylamine, N ,N bisdehydroabeitylamine, ethylenediamine, or bases of the pyridine type such as pyridine, collidine or quinoline, or other amines which have been used to form salts with known penicillins. Suitably R1 is phenyl optionally substituted with up to three groups selected from halogen, hydroxy, C16 alkoxy, nitro, amino, C16 alkyl, C16 haloalkyl, Cl 6 alkylcarbonyloxy or C16 alkylsulphonylamino. More suitably Rl is phenyl mono substituted phenyl where the substituent is fluorine, chlorine, bromine, hydroxy, methoxy, nitro, amino, acetoxy or trifluoromethyl or di substituted phenyl where the substituents are selected from acetoxy and methoxy. The compound of formula II employed in the process of the present invention may suitably be prepared by the processes disclosed in European Patent Publication No.0 015 690. Prior to the process of the present invention the compound of formula II may be enriched in.compound having the R configuration at the carbon atom marked by conventional methods such as, for example, chromatography. Suitable carboxyl blocking derivatives for the group CO2RX in formula II include salts, esters and anhydride derivatives of the carboxylic acid. The derivative is preferably one which may readily be cleaved at a later stage of the reaction. Suitable salts include tertiary amine salts, such as those with tri lower alkylamines, N ethylpiperidine, 2,6 lutidine, pyridine, N methylpyrrolidine, dimethylpiperazine. A preferred salt is with triethylamine. Suitable ester forming carboxyl blocking groups are those which may be removed under conventional conditions.Such groups for Rx include benzyl, p methoxybenzyl, 2,4,6trimethylbenzyl, 3, 5 di t butyl 4 hydroxybenzyl, benzoylmethyl, p nitrobenzyl, 4 pyridylmethyl, 2,2,2 trichloroethyl, 2,2, 2 tribromoethyl, t butyl, t amyl, diphenylmethyl, triphenylmethyl, adamantyl, 2 benzyloxyphenyl, 4 methylthiophenyl, tetrahydrofur 2 yl, tetrahydroyran 2 yl, pentachlorophenyl, p toluenesulphonylethyl, methoxymethyl, a silyl, stannyl or phosphorus containing group, such as described above, an oxime radical of formula N CHR0 where RO is aryl or heterocyclic, or an in vivo hydrolysable ester radical such as defined above. The carboxyl group may be regenerated under nonracemising conditions from any of the above esters by usual methods appropriate to the particular RX group, for example, mild acid catalysed hydrolysis, or by enzymicallycatalysed hydrolysis, or by hydrogenolysis. Suitable optionally substituted ammonium ions, M , for forming the salts of formula II include the ammonium ion and ions obtained by protonation of amines such as, for example, lower alkylamines such as triethylamine, hydroxylower alkylamines such as 2 hydroxyethylamine, bis 2hydroxyethyl amine or tri 2 hydroxyethyl amine, cycloalkylamines such as bicyclohexylamine, or with procaine, dibenzylamine, N,N dibenzylethylenediamine, morpholine,N methylmorpholine, or bases of the pyridine type such as pyridine, collidine or quinoline, or other amines which have been used to form salts with known penicillins. Preferably M is ammonium, triethylammonium orN methylmorpholinium. THe separation of the R isomer according to the present invention is effected through use of an appropriate solvent system. The mixture of diastereoisomers of formula II is dissolved in a suitable solvent. After the mixture is totally in solution, crystallisation is induced or allowed, consequently giving precipitation of the resulting crystals.To effect dissolution of the mixture of diastereoisomers, the solvent can be warmed if necessary. If impurities are present so that all of the solids do not dissolve, the undissolved solids can be removed from the liquid by conventional techniques such as settling, filtration or centrifugation. The appropriate solvent system for use in the present invention is to some extent determined by the choice of the ions, M , and may be readily found by trial and error. The solvent system may be single or multi component. Suitable single component solvent systems include C3 10 alkanones, such as, for example, acetone and 4 methylpentan 2 one. Suitable multi component solvent systems are two component systems, such as, for example, a polar organic solvent together with a non polar diluent. Suitable polar organic solvents include for example the alkyl esters of alkanoic acids, for example Cl to C6 alkyl Cl to C6 alkanoates, methyl and ethyl C6 to C10 alkanoates, C6 to C10 alkylacetates, ketones such as C3 to C10 alkanones, such as acetone and 4 methylpentan 2 one, water immiscible alcohols such as the C5 to C10 alkanols and halogenated hydrocarbons such as chloroform, methylene chloride and ethylene chloride. Suitable non polar diluents include the alkanes, toluene, benzene and di C1 to C6 alkyl ethers. Most convenient are di C2 4 alkyl ethers and those short chain 0 alkanes which are liquid at room temperature ca 20 C , for example C5 Clo alkanes. Preferred non polar diluents are diethyl ether and diisopropyl ether. The temperature at which the dilution and crystallisation is carried out is not critical, but we have found room temperature to be most convenient. It is, however, useful to cool the diluted solution to ensure complete crystallisation. It is preferred that the solution should be left to stand for some time before the solid is recovered, and crystallisation may be induced by adding a previously obtained seed crystal. After the crystals have formed, they can be separated from the supernatant liquid by conventional processes.These include settling, filtration and centrifugation. After separation of the crystals from the supernatant liquid, the solvent is removed from the remaining solute by conventional means, such as evaporation or vacuum evaporation. In some instances, it may be useful to heat the supernatant liquid separated from the crystals to shorten the evaporation time. One of the advantages of the present invention is that the solvent can be recovered from the evaporation step and recycled for further use in the process. In an advantageous adjunct to the present invention the supernatant liquid, which is enriched in the S isomer, may be treated as hereinbefore described to yield solute which may be racemised to yield, by the process of the present invention, further compounds of formula II wherein the carbon atom marked is in the R configuration. Suitable racemisation methods for the compound of formula II include base treatment at pH 8, such as, for example, stirring in water at pH 10. The process of the present invention provides a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or in vivo hydrolysable ester thereof. The process further provides crystalline compound of formula II . The compounds produced by the present invention are the substantially pure R isomers. The term substantically pure refers to compound containing at least 90 of theR isomeric form. More suitably the compound contains at least 95 of the R isomeric form. Preferably the compound contains at least 99 of the R isomeric form. The following Examples illustrate the process of the present invention.
