# Self contained array timing.

## Abstract
An on chip timing control apparatus 19 for generation of timing signals for a large scale integrated LSI chip or semi conductor memory array 12 is disclosed. This apparatus re quires only an off chip trigger pulse input 16 and it may be used both during the production testing of the memory and during normal functional operation. In the testing environment it allows use of much less expensive peripheral test equip ment, while also providing for much greater accuracy in deter mination of whether or not the memory array meets its timing specification. Use during normal functional operation subse quent to use in the test environment provides for a guarantee of defect free operation.
