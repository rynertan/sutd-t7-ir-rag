# A process for preparing hybridoma cells which produce tumour specific monoclonal antibodies.

## Abstract
High yielding hybridoma cell lines which secrete mono clonal antibodies capable of binding to tumour cells of one or more types, but substantially not to normal cells can be obtained more readily by fusing myeloma cells with anti body forming cells isolated from an animal immunized with tumour antigens, which has previously been made immu nological tolerant to normal cell antigens, comprising the total antigens, or at least a proportion of the total antigens, of the normal cells corresponding to the tumour cells chosen as the source of immunizing antigens.
