# DIGITAL MIXING APPARATUS

## Abstract
In a radar receiver signals at IF are converted to digital form at 22 and the real and imaginary components are separated at 24 and 25 before passing to respective digital low pass filters 28 and 29. These filters operate by adding samples within blocks of a given number of samples. In order to reduce the response of these filters at the sum frequency the first and last member of each blocks of samples taken by the filter is weighted so as to reduce its value relative to the centre values of the batch which are left unchanged relative to each other.
