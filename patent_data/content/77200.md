## Description
PRODUCING INSULATING LAYERS IN SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES. The present invention relates to the production of insulating layers in semiconductor devices. Dieletric layers are essential features of some semiconductor devices, for example, gate insulating layers in field effect transistors and dielectric layers of capacitors. Such devices may be included in components comprising transistor diode logic, transistortransistor logic, read only memory, or dynamic random access memory. Generally, the capacitance of capacitors is proportional to the relative dielectric constant of the dielectric material inserted between electrodes and inversely proportional to the distance between the electrodes. The trans conductance gm of field effect transistors is also proportional to the relative dielectric constant of the gate insulating dielectric layer and inversely proportional to the thickness of the layer. Thus, it is desirable to produce dielectric layers of a material which has a high relative dielectric constant and also a high dielectric breakdown voltage. Silicon dioxide SiO2 layers have been mainly used as dielectric layers, the functions of which are set forth above, based on the fact that silicon dioxide has a relative dielectric constant of 3.8 and a dielectric breakdown voltage of 10 MV cm. However, it has been found difficult to form a silicon dioxide layer the thickness of which is less than lOnm without pinholes which will inevitably lead to an. increased leakage of current, and, consequently, a lower breakdown voltage. Recently, in order to reduce the size of the elements and thus improve the integration of the elements, other dielectric materials having a relative dielectric constant higher than that of silicon dioxide have been used either tentatively or practically. Such dielectric materials are oxides of tantalum Ta , titanium Ti , niobium Nb , hafnium Hf , zirconium Zr , yttrium Y , and vanadium V . For example, tantalum oxide exhibits a relative dielectric constant of from 20 to 28. However, each of these dielectric oxides has disadvantages in tat the breakdown voltage is low and the leakage of current is large. Of course, these disadvantages may be reduced by thickening the dielectric layer, but this leads to unfavorable lowering of the capacitance. In attempting ta increase the breakdown voltage and decrease the leakage of current, t a Ta205 Si02 double layer may besused in which a silicon dioxide layer is first formed on a substrate and then a tantalum oxide Ta205 layer is formed thereon so as to form the Ta 205 Sio2 double layer. However, such a Ta205 SiO2 double structure exhibits a disadvantage in that the capacitance is low due to the thickness of the oxidized silicon, which thickness cannot be reduced owing to the occurrence of pin holes, as mentioned above. Furthermore, the electrical properties of the previously formed silicon dioxide layer deteriorate during the formation of tantalum oxide thereon, thereby lowering the breakdown voltage. In addition, such a double structure exhibits an unfavorable hysteresis in respect to the capacitance voltage characteristic of a diode due to the abrupt heterojunction thereof. According to the present invention there is provided a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device wherein a layer of an oxide of an element selected from the group made up of tantalum, titanium, niobium, hafnium, yttrium, zirconium, and vanadium is formed on a semiconductor substrate characterized in that the said semiconductor substrate having said layer of oxide thereon is heated in an oxidizing atmosphere so as to oxidize semiconductor material of the said substrate thereby to form an insulating layer made of an oxide of said semiconductor material, sandwiched between said layer of oxide and remaining semiconductor material of the said substrate. In one embodimetlt of the invention the oxide layer comprises a tantalum oxide layer, and the semiconductor layer may advantageously be made of silicon. It can be advantageous if said oxidizing atmosphere comprises wet oxygen and the oxidization is carried out at at a temperature in a range from 7000C to 12000C. A preferred embodiment of the present invention provides a process for producing a dielectric layer on a silicon semiconductor layer, characterized by the steps of depositing a tantalum layer on the surface of said silicon semiconductor layer oxidising said tantalum layer, thereby converting tantalum into tantalum oxide and heating said silicon semiconductor layer having said tantalum oxide layer thereon in an oxidizong atmosphere, thereby thermally oxidizing the silicon constituting said semiconductor layer so as to form an insulating layer which comprises silicon oxide at the interface between said semiconductor layer and said tantalum oxide layer. It is desirable that said silicon semiconductor layer is of a one conductivity type. Advantageously said process can further comprise the step of forming an electrically conductive layer on said tantalum oxide layer. An embodiment of the present invention can provide a process for producing a dielectric layer having a desirably high relative dielectric constant, a relatively high dielectric breakdown voltage, and desirably small current leakage. Such a dielectric layer can be made to exhibit very low hysteresis in respect to the capacitance voltage characteristic of a diode. It has been noted that A.G. Revesz et al of Comsat Labratories teach in Film Substrate Interaction in Si Ta and Si Ta205 Structures in the Journal of the Electro chemical Society, Vol. 123, No. 10, October 1976, that if a tantalum film is deposited on a silicon substrate and oxidized, the resultant tantalum oxide film contains a significant amount of silicon, and the majority of the silicon atoms incorporated into the tantalum oxide film are concentrated near the interface while a small amount of the Silicon atoms are concentrated at the outer sut face of the tantalum oxide film. During oxidation, the thus diffused silicon atoms are also oxidised by oxygen, which diffuses through the tantalum oxide. However, Revesz et al do not suggest the forming of an effective silicon oxide layer under the tantalum oxide layer so as to realize a dielectric layer to form a necessary feature of a semiconductor device. In addition, B.E. Deal et al teach in General Rela tionship for the Thermal Oxidation of Silicon in the Journal of Applied Physics, Viol. 36, No. 12, December 1965, that silicon is oxidized more quickly in wet oxygen 1than in dry oxygen. However, they do not suggest that oxygen can diffuse through a tantalum oxide layer.

Figures 28 and 29 are diagrams showing the function of a l transistor type nonvolatile memory device. A high dielectric layer 2 , e.g., tantalum oxide Ta205 , may be formed on a semiconductor substrate 1 either by an indirect process, e.g., first depositing tantalum 2 by vacuum vapor deposition or sputtering Fig. la and then oxidizing tantalum into tantalum oxide 2 , or by a direct process, e.g., chemical vapor deposition or oxide sputtering Fig. lb . The thus obtained oxide may be further subjected to a thermal treatment, whereby the oxide may be crystallized and improved in respect to thermal stability. The low breakdown voltage of the tantalum oxide 2 is compensated for by heating the substrate 1 in an oxidizing atmosphere so as to form a layer of oxide of the semiconductor material 3 , e.g., silicon oxide, mainly at the interface between the semiconductor substrate 1 and the tantalum oxide 2 Fig. lc . The thus formed composite oxide layer is better illustrated in Fig. 2 The composition was determined by theAuger sputtering method. At the end of the tantalum region, the silicon shifted in a combined state with the oxygen Fig. 2 . In the following experiments, the total thickness of the oxide layer was determined by the Talystep method before and after oxidation and then the difference in thickness was assumed to be the thickness of oxidized silicon. A silicon substrate coated with tantalum oxide 45 nm thick A and a bare silicon substrate B were oxidized. in wet oxygen Fig. 3 . A silicon substrate coated with tantalum oxide 24 nm thick C and a bare silicon substrate D were oxidized in dry oxygen Fig. 3 . These thermal treatments were continued for 30 minutes at various temperatures. The substrates A, B were oxidized quickly in wet oxygen without regarding the coating of tantalum oxide and were effective at a temperature higher than 700 C. Contrary to this, the substrates C, D were oxidized slowly in dry oxygen, particularly in the case coated with tantalum oxide, and were oxidized only at a temperature higher than 9000C An oxidation temperature higher than 12800C exhibited no advantages in respect to the consumption of energy in relation to either wet or dry oxidation. The thickness of the oxidized silicon gradually increased as heating of the silicon semiconductor substratesA, B, C, and D used in the experiment of Fig. 3 was con tinued Fig. 4 . These substrates A, B, C, and D were heated at 1000 C. Wet oxidation A, B was superior to dry oxidation C, D in respect to their growth. As can be seen from the graphs of Figs. 3 and 4, oxygen in a wet oxygen atmosphere diffuses freely through the tantalum oxide layer. Contrary to this, oxygen in a dry oxygen atmosphere scarcely diffuses therethrough.Furthermore, it was confirmed that oxygen in a wet oxygen atmosphere diffuses several um laterally through a tantalum layer 45 nm thick. A silicon substrate coated with tantalum oxide 45 nm thick was heated in wet oxygen at 800 C. Oxidation was continued for 10 minutes F , 20 minutes G and 30 minutes H Fig. 5 . Thus, the silicon at the interface was oxidized so as to produce a dielectric layer according to the present invention. The dielectric layers F, G, and H, which correspond to the curves F, G, and H, had a breakdown voltage of approximately 6 V, 10 V, and 15 V, respectively, and an effective dielectric constant of 13, 11, and 9, respectively. The SiO2 layer formed at the interface of Ta205 Si substrate by oxidation after coating the substrate with Ta 205 included almost no pin holes and consequently exhibited a breakdown voltage much higher than that of a SiO2 layer formed by thermal oxidation of a bare silicon substrate in a conventional manner. Thus, double oxide layer produced in a method embodying the present invention, can exhibit a high dielectric constant and a high breakdown voltage. Example 1 A layer of tantalum 15 nm thick 2 was deposited on a silicon substrate 1 by RF sputtering in argon at 4 x 10 2 Torr Fig. la . The substrate 1 was heated in dry oxygen at 5250C for 40 minutes. As a result, a tantalum oxide 2 layer 33 nm thick was formed Fig. lb . The substrate 1 having a tantalum oxide layer 2 thereon was heated in wet oxygen at 8000C for 13 minutes. Oxide layers 3 comprising silicon oxide were produced mainly under the tantalum oxide layer, i.e., the thickness of the silicon oxide was 0.3 nm on the surface and 5 nm at the interface between the tantalum oxide layer 2 and the silicon substrate 1 , respectively Fig. lc . In addition, a very thin silicon oxide layer not shown was formed on the surface of the tantalum oxide layer 2 during oxidation in a wet oxygen atmosphere. The substrate was annealed in nitrogen containing 5 by volume of hydrogen at 10500C for 30 minutes and then electrodes were produced not shown .The thus obtained dielectric layer composite having silicon oxide in addition to tantalum oxide exhibited a relative dielectric constant of 15, a dielectric breakdown voltage of 4 MV cm, and a leakage current on the order of 10 10 A at 5 V. The relative dielectric constant was more than three times greater than that of silicon oxide, and the breakdown voltage was several times greater than that of tantalum oxide. In addition, this composite exhibited no hysteresis in respect to the capacitance voltage characteristic of a diode. Furthermore, it is preferable that the amount of silicon contained in an electrode of silicide of a high melting point metal, e.g., molybdenum silicide, which is formed on the tantalum oxide layer not exceed the stoichiometry ratio. Our experiment revealed that in the case where the molybdenum silicide layer of the upper electrode is MoSi3 i.e., rich in silicon, an increase in the leakage of current is evident and that, contrary to this, a layer of MoSi orMoSi2 does not exhibit an increased leakage of current even after thermal treatment at 10000C. We consider the reason for this to be as follows.Silicon atoms pile up from the molybdenum silicide layer at the interface between the molybdenum silicide layer and the tantalum oxide layer 22 so as to form an apparent Si Ta 205 interface in the case where the molybdenum silicide layer is rich in silicon, and, thus, Si and Ta2O5 diffuse and react with each other. Contrary to this, MoSi2 satisfies the stoichiometry ratio, i.e., it does not discharge silicon atoms. Molybdenum atoms which pile up from a MoSi layer, however, do not react with Ta205 , which is thermodynamically stable in the Mo Ta205 system. Thus, the upper electrode 4 of the molybdenum silicide layer formed on the tantalum oxide layer 3 must not contain silicon in an amount in excess of the stoichiometry ratio. This holds true not only for the MoSi Ta205 system but also for other silicide oxide systems which comprises silicide, e.g., of tungsten, tantalum, or platinum and oxide of a metal in the group 3A, 4A, or 5A of the periodic table of elements. Example 2 Figures 6 through 12 are diagrams showing the steps for producing a dynamic random access memory device by a method embodying the present invention. Field oxide layers 12 1 um thick were produced on a p type silicon semiconductor substrate 11 in a usual manner. A tantalum layer 13 20 nm thick was produced on 2 the substrate by RF sputtering in argon at 4 x 10 Torr with an accerelating voltage of 2.3 KV Fig. 6 . The tantalum layer 13 was converted to a tantalum oxide layer 13 44 nm thick by heating it at 5000C and then heating the substrate 11 at 8000C in wet oxygen, and thereby a silicon oxide layer 14 6 nm thick was produced at the interface between the silicon substrate 11 and the tantalum oxide layer 13 Fig. 7 . A molybdenum Mo or molybdenum silicide electrode 15 for capacitor electrode was sputtered on the tantalum oxide layer 13 and then an insulating layer 16 of silicon oxide was deposited by chemical vapor deposition Fig. 8 . The insulating layer 16 , the capacitor electrode 15 , and the tantalum oxide layer 13 were partly removed by dry etching with a CHF3 etchant, thus ss partially exposing the silicon oxide layer 14 at the interface Fig. 9 . A silicon oxide layer 17 was further deposited by chemical vapor deposition Fig. 10 . The silicon oxide layer 17 was removed, except for the portion coating the side surface side wall of the capacitor electrode 15 , by dry etching. Then a transfer gate insulating layer 18 40 nm thick was formed on the silicon substrate 11 by thermal oxidation Fig. 11 . A transfer gate electrode 19 was formed by depositing and patterning polycrystalline silicon. Then, a n type bit line contact region 20 was formed by arsenic As ion implantation, whereby arsenic was implanted into the transfer gate electrode 19 . An electrode contact window was opened by forming and patterning the silicon oxide layer 21 . A bit line 22 was formed by depositing and patterning an aluminum layer Fig. 12 . The thus obtained dynamic random access memory device exhibited a significantly small leakage current and a higher integration. Example 3 Figures 13 through 16 are diagrams showing the steps for producing a MOS field effect transistor by a method embodying the present invention. A tantalum oxide layer 32 50 nm thick was produced on a p type silicon semiconductor substrate 31 in a manner similar to that of Example 2 Fig. 13 and was removed, except for the portion coating the positive regions, by a conventional process. Field oxide layers 33 were produced on the field region in a usual manner. A silicon oxide layer 34 was formed by thermal oxidation in wet oxygen at 000C for 50 minutes at the interface between the tantalum oxide layer 32 and the silicon substrate 31 . A Y dr stalIi silicon gate electrode 35 was formed by chemical vapor deposition and dry etching with a CC14 etchant Fig. 149. An oxide layer 36 was formed on the gate electrode 35 by heating the substrate in dry oxygen Fig. 15 . Contact windows were opened by exposing the positive regions in the insulating silicon oxide layer 34 by selfalignment patterning of the tantalum oxide layer 32 .Then n type source and drain regions 37, 38 were formed by soft etching and ion implantation. Source and drain electrodes 39, 40 were formed by self alignment patterning of the insulating layer 36 and by depositing and patterning aluminum by means of conventional photolithography technique Fig. 16 . As contact windows are opened by self alignment, a short channel gate transistor can be easily realized. A tantalum oxide layer is used as a mask for selective oxidation, and, consequently, the occurrence of so called bird beak, white ribbon, and strain in the substrate is prevented. Example 4 Figure 17 through 21 are diagrams showing the steps for producing lateral isolation of integrated circuits.A tantalum oxide layer 52 ca. 100 nm thick was deposited on a single crystalline silicon substrate 51 by reactive sputtering Fig. 17 and was cut open in the desired region by means of photolithography and dry etching with a CHF3 etchant so as to form lattice like openings 52 Fig. 18 . A polycrystalline silicon layer 53 ca. 3 pm thick was deposited on the substrate 51 by chemical vapor deposition and was transformed by laser annealing into a single crystalline layer, since the surface of substrate 51 contacting the polycrystalline silicon layer 53 acted as crystallizing nuclei. A silicon nitride layer 66 100 nm thick was formed on the single crystalline silicon layer 53 by chemical vapor deposition. Windows 67 were opened through the silicon nitride layer 66 and the single crystalline silicon layer 53 by reactive ion etching with a CC14 etchant Fig. 19 . The substrate was treated in wet oxygen at 10000C for 80 minutes, and oxygen flowed through the windows 67 and diffused through the tantalum oxide layer 52 since the tantalum oxide acted as an oxygen passage. Consequently, not only the side wall 65 of the windows 67 but also the surface 54 of the silicon substrate 51 and the lower portion 55 of the transformed single crystalline silicon layer 53 were oxidized so as to form a silicon oxide insulating layer Fig. 20 . Silicon oxide layers 68 were deposited into the windows 67 by chemical vapor deposition so as to separate the single crystalline silicon islands 53 , on which circuit elements could be produced. The silicon nitride layer 66 was removed with hot phosphoric acid. Thus, a large scale integrated circuit, particularly bipolar type semiconductor devices, with complete insulation could be produced. In addition, in the case where spacing of the lattice structure of the tantalum oxide layer 52 is selectively broaden in an oxidation process, there remains between the silicon substrate 51 and the single crystalline silicon layer 53 an unoxidized silicon layer. Thereby an electrical connection is obtained between the silicon substrate 51 and the single crystalline silicon layer 53 . Example 5 Figures 22 and 23 are diagrams showing the steps for producing multilayered isolation of integrated circuits A tantalum oxide layer 72 50 nm thick and a polycrystalline silicon layer 73 were sequentially formed on a silicon substrate 71 in a manner similar to that ofExample 4. Another tantalum oxide layer 72 and another polycrystalline silicon layer 73 were further formed thereon. Then these layers 72, 73, 72 , 73 were patterned so as to expose the side surfaces of the tantalum oxide layers 72, 72 Fig. 22 . These layers were oxidized in wet oxygen at 10000C for 20 minutes. As the tantalum oxide layers 72, 72 acted as passages for the diffusion of oxygen, the surface of both polycrystalline silicon layers 73, 73sir and the silicon substrate 71 were oxidized so as to form silicon oxide layers 74 , 75 , 75 , 75 . The silicon surfaces 74, 75 were oxidized by direct contact with oxygen. The polycrystalline silicon layers 73, 73 which were retained without being oxidized acted as electrical passages. Thus the separation of elements and also multilayered wiring could be effected easily and exactly. Example 6 Figures 24 through 29 are diagrams showing the steps for producing a l one transistdr type nonvolatile memory device. Field oxide layers 88 and a tantalum oxide layer 89 44 nm thick were produced on a p type silicon substrate 81 in a manner similar to that of Example 2. Then a polycrystalline silicon layer 86 500 nm thick was formed on the tantalum oxide layer 89 by chemical vapor deposition Fig. 24 . These layers 86, 89 were selectively removed so as to form a polycrystalline, silicon gate electrode 86 and the second insulating layer of tantalum oxide 89 .N type source and drain regions 82, 83 were produced by masking with these layer 86 , 89 and implanting arsenic as a donor type impurity into the substrate 81 Fig. 25 . The substrate was subjected to thermal oxidation in wet oxygen at 8000C for 10 minutes. Thus, the exposed silicon surfaces 90, 91 of the substrate and the gate electrode were oxidized. In addition, oxygen diffused through the tantalum oxide layer 89 so as to form the first and the third insulating layers of silicon oxide 91 , 90 under the gate electrode 86 Fig. 26 . The substrate was annealed in a mixture of nitrogen and 5 by volume of hydrogen at 10000C for 20 minutes so as to reduce the tantalum oxide layer 89 . Consequently, a number of traps were produced due to the vacancy of oxygen in the reduced oxide layer 89 , which traps could accumulate electric charge Fig. 27 . During the annealing, silicon in the gate electrode 86 and the substrate 81 was oxidized very slightly, probably due to the discharge of oxigen generated by the reduction of Tea205 with hydrogen. Then, a word line 92 of aluminum was produced on the gate electrode 86 , after a contact hole was opened in the silicon oxide layer 88 , in a usual manner Fig. 27 . Figure 28 is a plan of a l transistor type nonvolatile semiconductor random access memory device and indicates the following elements field insulating oxide layers 88 , gate electrodes 86 , contact holes 93 opened on the gate electrodes 86 , an n type region 83 constituting bit lines defined by the adjacent dot dash lines B, and an n type region 82 constituting earth lines defined by the adjacent broken lines C. However, insulating silicon oxide layers 88 in Fig. 27 and aluminum word lines 92 in Fig.27 are not shown Fig. 28 . The operation principle of the l transistor type nonvolatile semiconductor memory will be illustrated with reference to Fig. 29, which shows an equivalent circuit of the random access memory shown in Fig. 28. Figure 29 illustrates bit lines B1 , B2 and earth lines C1 , C2 connected to drains and sources of each transistor, respectively, and word lines D1 , D2 t D3 connected to gates of each transistor. These constitute the memories 101 through 106. In order to write only in cell 101, a potential 10 V is applied to word line D1 , and bit line B1 is grounded.Thus, a writing voltage of 10 V is applied to the gate of cell 101. Electrons are injected and accumulated from n type region constituting the bit line into the second insulating layer of tantalum oxide in the gate. At the same time, bit lines B2 of cell 103 is maintained at an open potential so as to inhibit writing in cell 103 connected to the same word line as cell 101, and earth linesC1, C2 are also maintained at an open potential so as to inhibit electron injection from the earth lines into cells 101 and 103. In order to read out from cell 101, potentials 3 V and 5 V are applied to word line D1 and bit line B, r respectively, and, then, it is determined whether the cell is ON or OFF, i.e., the absence of and the accumulation of electrons in the gate result in a current and no current between the source and drain, respectively. Erasing the memory is carried out inversely to the writing procedure. Word line D1 is grounded and a potential 10 V is applied to bit line B1. Consequently, electrons accumulated in the gate are erased by the tunnel effect up to the n type region constituting the bit line.Bit line B1 is connected to other cells 102, 104, 105. In order to avoid erasing of information written in these cells, a potential 5 V is applied to word lines D2 , D3.Thus, the effective electron discharge voltage is 5 V, which does not cause the tunnel effect. In addition, earth lines C1 , C2 on both sides of bit line B1 are maintained at an open potential, thereby inhibiting current flow into the adjacent cells.
