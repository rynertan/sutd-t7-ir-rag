# IMPROVEMENTS IN CATALYSTS

## Abstract
A catalyst having stability in air, exhibiting long life and capable of use in the conversion of synthesis gas to hydro carbons, consists of particles of a disordered residue inter calate having a catalytic substance derived from the guest substance on the outer surfaces of the particles. The disor dered residue intercalate retains about 1 10 of guest sub stance, modifying its electronic properties.
