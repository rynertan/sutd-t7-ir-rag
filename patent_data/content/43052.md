## Description
OPEN CELL ETHYLENE IONOMER FOAMS AND PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION THEREOF. The present invention relates to open cell olefin polymer foams and to foamable compositions and foaming processes for the preparation thereof. More specifically, it relates to foamable ethylenic ionomer compositions which provide open cell ethylenic ionomer foam products having microporous cell membranes. Heretofore, polyolefin resin foams have been used widely as shock absorbing materials and heat insulating materials because of such advantageous features of the polyolefin resins as good toughness, flexibility, elasticity and chemical inertness. However, most polyolefin resin foams proposed so far are substantially closed cell foams which exhibit less flexibility than often desired for such applications as flexible, heat insulating materials, cushioning materials for clothing and shock absorbing packaging materials for agricultural products requiring air permeability. Also, they are typically not suitable for use as base materials of filters for the pharmaceutical and chemical industries or for other industrial applications such as anti pollution devices. Several types of resin compositions for open cell foams are known including those of rubber latex and urethane foams. However, these compositions are difficult to expand to very low densities and the resulting foams are generally poor in water resistance, chemical resistance and light resistance Japanese Patent KOKAI No. 47 1972 l,996 discloses a process for producing an open cell, fluid permeable polyolefin resin foam having uniformly microporous cell membranes, by adding a low boiling blowing agent and oxides of metals belonging to GroupsIa, IIa and IIb of the periodic table to an ethylene vinyl ester copolymer resin or ethylene unsaturated carboxylate copolymer resin retaining the resultant mixture for at least 10 minutes in an extruder at a temperature from about 200C below the crystalline melting point of said copolymer resin to SOC above the crystalline melting point and then extruding the resin mixture into a zone of lower pressure. However, this process has several drawbacks including the necessity of large scale extrusion expansion equipment, difficulty in obtaining homogeneous crosslinking non uniformity of the open cell foam and the instability of the extrusion foaming process. In a series of intensive studies, the present inventors have developed foamable polymer compositions which are usable for commercial scale production of flexible, open cell foams having a desirable fluid permeability toward both gaseous and liquid fluid materials as well as good water, chemical, and light resistance. In accordance with the present invention, it has been found that foamable polymer compositions composed of a certain selected ethylenic ionomer resins and b a blowing agent can be suitably used for commercial scale production of flexible, highly expanded i.e., relatively low density open cell, fluid permeable foam products having relatively uniform microporous cell membranes ad having good water and chemical resistance as well as good W light stability.Accordingly, in one aspect the present invention is a foamable or expandable polymer composition which comprises a an ethylenic ionomer which 1 is crosslinked by metal ions 2 contains from 85 to 98.5 mol percent of ethylene polymerized therein and 3 has a crystallization initiating temperature, T, in degrees centigrade which satisfies the following Formula I 102 3.02 98.5 A T 1 102 9.29 98.5 A wherein A represents the ethylene content of said ionomer in mol percent, and b a suitable blowing agent. In another aspect, the present invention is an open cell ethylenic ionomer foam product resulting from the expansion or foaming of the aforementioned foamable composition. In yet another aspect, the present invention is a foaming process for the preparation of such open cell ethylenic ionomer foam products. The open cell ethylenic ionomer foam products provided by the present invention are useful as flexible packaging materials, as cushioning materials for clothing and the like, as insulating materials and as filter media for various commercial applications as well as for various pollution control uses and the like. Figure 1 is a graph illustrating the requisite relationship between the ethylene content and the crystallization initiating temperatures for ethylenic ionomers suitable for use in the practice of the present invention. In this graph, the line segment BC represents the requirement that the ethylenic ionomer contains at least 85 mol percent of ethylene polymerized therein.The line segment AB in Figure 1 represents the lower most boundary or limitation for the crystallization initiating temperature T as a function of ethylene content for ethylenic ionomers suitable for use in the present invention. It is a graphical representation of the requirement in the Formula I that T 1 102 9.29 98.5 A .Similarly, the line segment AC in Figure 1 is a graphical representation of the Formula I requirement that T 102 3.02 98.5 A and thereby represents the uppermost boundary or limitation for the crystallization initiating temperature as a function of ethylene content for the ethylenic ionomers employed in the practice of this invention. In addition to graphically illustrating by the area circumscribed by the line segments AB, AC andBC the requisite combination of ethylene content and crystallization initiating temperatures characteristic of ethylenic ionomers suitable for use herein, Figure 1 also shows coordinates representing the combination of those two parameters for the ethylenic ionomers employed in Examples 1 12 and Reference Experiments 1 8. The coordinates referring to the various Examples are represented by the symbol e accompanied by the corres ponding Example number and the coordinates referring to the various Reference Experiments are represented by the symbol X accompanied by the corresponding ReferenceExperiment Number. Figure 2 is a graph illustrating the relationship between the crystallization initiating tempera ture and the proportion of open cells in the resultant foams for the various ethylenic ionomers employed inExamples 7 10 and Reference Experiments 6 8. In this figure, the solid line shows the proportion of cells interconnected through relatively large pores as measured by the described reduced pressure water impregnation method. The broken line shows the proportion of cells interconnected through micropores as measured by the described air pycnometer method. TI and TII, respectively, in Figure 2 show the lower and upper limits of the crystallization initiating temperatures for the ethylenic ionomers employed in Examples 7 10 and Reference Experiments 6 8. As indicated, the ethylenic ionomers employed in the practice of the present invention are required to be crosslinked by metal ions, to contain from 85 to 98.5 mol percent of ethylene polymerized therein and to have a crystallization initiating temperature, T OC , defined by Formula I. The limitation on the crystallization initiating temperature is one of the key factors for obtaining open cell foams having uniformly microporous cell membranes. With an ethylenic ionomer having a combination of ethylene content and crystallization initiating temperature outside the scope corresponding to the closed domain defined by the line segments AB, AC andBC in Figure 1, open cell foam having suitably uniform microporous cell membranes are not obtained. The reason why such an interrelation between the ethylene content and the crystallization initiating temperature of the ethylenic ionomer has an influence on the properties of the resultant foam is not clear. Perhaps outside the domain defined by Formula I, the ethylenic ionomer is crystallized simultaneously with expansion in the foaming process causing uneven cell membranes and heterogeneous microporosity. If the ethylene content of the ethylenic ionomer is smaller than 85 mol percent, the ethylenic ionomer itself becomes very soft and almost unable to retain a predetermined shape in the foaming process.Also, such ethylenic ionomer resin compositions cannot be highly expanded because the resultant foam will undergo severe shrinkage and or show a very bad appearance with many wrinkles. On the other hand, if the ethylene content is higher than 98.5 mol percent, a substantially open cell foam will not usually be obtained or be acceptable because of severe shrinkage or deformation caused by large internal blow holes. Preferably, the ethylenic ionomer to be used in the present invention should have a melt index MI ranging from 0.1 to 30 g 10 min. as measured according to ASTM D1238 57T. Among the ethylenic ionomers defined byFormula I and as usable in the present invention, it is preferable to use those ethylenic ionomers more narrowly defined by Formula II 102 3.02 98.5 A 2 T 102 8.64 98.5 A II wherein A is the ethylene content of the ethylenic ionomer and ranges from 92 to 98.5 mol percent, and T in OC is the crystallization initiating temperature of the ionomer. The physical properties of the resultant foams, the ease of foaming and the stability of a continuous foaming operation as well as the stability of foams having large cross sectional areas are important advantages achieved with the preferred ionomers defined by Formula II. More preferable examples of the ethylenic ionomers according to the present invention are copolymers composed of ethylene and an alpha, beta ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid which is partially or entirely crosslinked by metal ions. In some cases they are composed of ethylene, the unsaturated carboxylic acid, and a C1 C6 alkyl ester of an alpha, beta ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid.The copolymers contain A, B, C and D mols of the units represented by the following chemical Formulas a , b , c and d , respectively EMI7.1 EMI8.1 wherein R1 represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl group, R2 represents an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, M represents a metallic element and n is an integer ranging from 1 to 3 and these units are present within the ranges defined by the followingFormulas 1 , 2 and 3 B C D A B C D x 100 from 1.5 to 15 . . . 1 B C B C D x 100 from 20 to 100 . . . . . 2 B B C x 100 10 3 The copolymers satisfying these conditions may be produced by the methods of Japanese Patent PublicationNo. 49 1974 31,556 or Japanese Patent Kokai No. 50 1975 8,885. As blowing agents, any of the well known thermally decomposable chemical blowing agents or volatile organic blowing agents may be used. However, more preferable for the present invention are volatile organic blowing agents having boiling points lower than the melting point of the ethylenic ionomer used.Typical examples of such preferable volatile organic blowing agents include lower hydrocarbons such as propane, butane, pentane, pentene and hexane as well as halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride, methyl chloride, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorofluoromethane, chlorodifluoromethane, chlorotrifluoromethane, dichlorodifluoromethane, l,l difluoroethane, l chloro l,l difluoroethane, 1, 2 dichlorotetrafluoroethane and chloropentafluoroethane. These volatile organic blowing agents may be used individually or as mixtures. Typical examples of preferable chemical blowing agents include azodicarbonamide, azobisisobutyronitrile, dinitrosopentamethylenetetramine and paratoluenesulfonyl hydrazide, etc. These chemical blowing agents may be used singly or as mixtures or as mixtures with the volatile organic blowing agents. In the polymer composition composed of an ethylenic ionomer and a blowing agent according to the present invention, its blowing agent content may be selected appropriately depending on the types of the ionomer and blowing agent used as well as on the properties desired for the resultant open cell foam. In ordinary cases, however, the blowing agent content ranges from 5 to 50 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the ethylenic ionomer. The blowing agent and ethylenic ionomer components may be admixed and kneaded by any suitable means such as a single screw extruder, twin screw extruder or Banbury mixer. Also, a preliminary blend of the ethylenic ionomer and the blowing agent may be prepared as a dryblend or masterbatch or by impregnating the ethylenic ionomer with the blowing agent. Alternatively, the blowing agent may be mixed with the ethylenic ionomer in a molten or heat plastified state just before expansion. Further, the polymer compositions may be crosslinked with electron beams or a chemical crosslinking agent before expansion, if desired. The foamable polymer composition of the present invention may be expanded into a foam by conventional methods. Thus, for example, a conventional extrusion foaming technique can be employed in which the polymer plus blowing agent is continuously heated and or worked in an extruder to be melted or heat plastified at an elevated temperature and pressure. Then, the resultant molten or heat plastified mixture is extruded into a zone of lower pressure and temperature to expand into a foam. Alternatively, a batch method may be used in which the foamable polymer composition of the present invention is melted at an elevated temperature under high pressure and then the pressure is removed to expand the molten mixture. However, the polymer composition of the present invention is particularly effective when it is to be expanded by extrusion, especially to twenty or more times its original volume. The foamable polymer composition according to the present invention may contain minor amounts of lubricating and nucleating agents such as zinc stearate or similar metal soaps and finely ground calcium silicate or the like inorganic salts. Also, the polymer composition of the present invention may contain an ultraviolet light absorber, anti oxidizing stabilizer and or colorant.Further, to improve the physical properties of the resulting foam, a thermoplastic synthetic resin may be added to the polymer composition in an amount that does not impede formation of open cells. The foamable polymer composition may be expanded into almost any shape including sheets, blocks, rods, and pipes, or it may be expanded in composite or clad forms with other materials. The present invention is further illustrated by the following examples and the accompanying reference experiments in which the effects of the present invention were evaluated in terms of the properties and parameters described below. Also, all parts and percentages are given on a weight basis ùr,less otherwise specified. 1 Ethylene Content of the Ionomer First, the carbon content is determined by quantitative elementary analysis of the ionomer. Then, the ethylene content of that ionomer is determined from a preplotted calibration curve of ethylene vs. carbon content of the ionomer. 2 Crystallization Initiating Temperature of the Ionomer A specimen of the ionomer is heated at a rate of 100C min. until melted and is then cooled at a rate of 100C min. until it begins to crystallize as determined with a differential scanning calorimeter Model IB manufactured by The Perkin Elmer Corp. The temperature at which crystallization is thus observed to begin is the crystallization initiating temperature for the purposes of the present invention. 3 Melt Index NI of the Ionomer The melt index of the ionomer is determined in accordance with ASTM D1238 57T. 4 Open Interconnected Cell Proportion of the Foam The open cell proportion of foam prepared from a foamable polymer composition of the present invention or from a foamable reference polymer composition is determined by the following two methods. a Water impregnation method under reduced pressure. The foam is cut into a cubic specimen of 30 x 30 x 30 mm. After measuring its weight, the specimen is immersed in water at 150C for 15 minutes in an atmosphere having a reduced pressure of 300 mm Hg. Then, after breaking the vacuum, the specimen is taken out of the water and its surface is lightly wiped with a gauze wet with ethanol. Thereafter, the weight of the specimen is measured again and to the open cell proportion calculated from the following formula Open cell proportion EMI12.1 1 cc x gram water x 100 where WO represents the initial weight in grams g of the specimen, W1 is the weight in grams g of the specimen impregnated with water, V is the volume cm3 of the cubic specimen, and d is the density g cm3 of the ionomer resin employed in the foam. b Air pycnometer method In this method, the open cell proportion is determined with an air pycnometer Model 930 manufactured by Toshiba Beckman Co., Ltd. in accordance with ASTM D2856. 5 Visual Evaluation of Open Cells In the same manner as in the foregoing water impregnation method, a cut foam specimen is immersed in water containing red ink and a surfactant instead of pure water. Then, the thus treated specimen is cuL alld visually inspected to observe how the red ink is distributed over the cut surface of the specimen. In addition, the surface of another specimen of the foam is microscopically examined to see the distribution of fine cells ranging from Sp to loop in size.Examples 1 Through 6 For extrusion, there was used an extrusion line composed of an extruder with a barrel diameter of 65 mm having a kneading zone at the forward end of its screw, a blowing agent feed line connected to the kneading zone, a heat exchanger coupled to the extruder outlet for controlling the temperature, the the kneaded molten polymer and a die having an orifice of 8.0 mm in diameter connected to the heat exchanger outlet. Each ionomer shown in Table I was fed into the extruder and was heated, melted and kneaded therein together ,waith 25 parts, per 100 parts of the ionomer, of dichlorodifluoromethane as a blowing agent fed under pressure through the blowing agent feed line, and the polymer composition was extruded continuously through the die into a zone at atmospheric pressure to be expanded into a round foamed rod. The foaming temperature of each ionomer was set at a level suitable for obtaining a foam with uniform quality and such suitable temperature was determined in each case by varying the temperature at the point of extrusion foaming above the melting point of each ionomer. The properties of the resultant foams are summarized in Table I along with the ethylene content and crystallization initiating temperature of each ionomer used. The resultant foams of Examples 1 through 6 had uniformly distributed open cells with an average size of 0.5 mm.References 1 Thorough 5 Except for the fact that other ionomers were used as shown in Table I, the same procedures and conditions as those used in Examples 1 through 6 were repeated. Unlike the foams resulting from Examples 1 through 6 i.e., which contained 90 or more of open cells as determined by air pycnometer , the resultant foams of these reference experiments all had substantially closed cell structures, with their open cells, if any, being confined only to small areas in their surface skins.

Examples 7 Through 10 and References 6 Through 8 In Examples 7 through 10 and References 6 through 8, the same procedures and conditions as were used in Examples 1 through 6 were repeated except that the ethylenic ionomers used all contained 94 mole percent of ethylene but had varied crystallization initiating temperatures as shown in Table II. The properties of the resultant foams are summarized inTable II and are also shown in Figure 2 of the accompanying drawings. As is clearly seen from Table II and Figure 2, the use of the foamable ionomer compositions of the present invention provided foams which have, as evidenced by the aforementioned water impregnation method under reduced pressure, open cells interconnected with each other through relatively large pores in their walls, as well as cells interconnected with each other through micropores which are not detected by the water impregnation method owing to a higher resistance to water absorption but which are detectable by the aforementioned air pycnometer method.

Examples 11 and 12 In Examples 11 and 12, the ethylenic ionomers used both contained 95 mol percent ethylene polymerized therein but had crystallization initiating temperatures of 700C and 750C, respectively. In such examples, each of such ionomer containing resin compositions was expanded at various temperatures in order to determine tlit Inaxiirum and minimum foaming temperatures at which substantially open cell, homogeneous quality foams could be otained.The difference between such maximum and minimum acceptable foaming temperature evidences the degree of sensitivity of the respective foamable compositions to the temperature at which they are foamed and thereby reflects the tolerance or operating flexibility of such compositions in terms of the range of temperatures at which they can be suitably expanded into acceptable open cell foam products. Such suitable foaming temperature range as thus determined is herein designated as the favorable foaming temperature range in centigrade degrees and the results of such determinations are shown in Table III below.Examples 13a Through 13d With the exception that the ethylenic ionomers of Examples 7 through 10, respectively, were used, the same procedures and conditions as those used in the foregoing Examples 11 and 12 were repeated to determine the favorable foaming temperature ranges for these respective ionomer containing resin compositions. The results of these determinations are also shown in TableIII.

As can be clearly seen from Table III, the ionomers which have the crystallization initiating temperatures represented by Formula II are more preferable than the other ionomers shown in Table III, because of the broader range of the favorable foaming temperatures which are exhibited thereby. 102 3.02 98.5 A T 102 8.64 98.5 A IIEvaluation of the Foam of Example 3 as Compared with Conventional Ethylenic Ionomer Foam and SoftPolyurethane Foam The ethylenic ionomer foam obtained in the previously described Example 3 was evaluated in terms of its compressive strength, weather resistance and water resistance measured as described hereinbelow, as compared with the ethylenic ionomer foam of the previously described Reference 3 and as compared with a nonrigid polyurethane foam according to the prior art. 1 Compressive Strength The compressive strength of each specimen was measured in accordance with JIS K6767. 2 Weather Resistance For measuring the weather resistance, each specimen was exposed to the outdoor atmosphere for 6 months, and its weather resistance was evaluated in terms of reduction in its compres sive strength in this period, the results of which are summarized in Table IV as follows Foams showing reduction in compressive strength smaller than 30 . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
