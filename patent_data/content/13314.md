## Description
TI LI Ol1 T1li INV NTIOI SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a SEMICONDUCTOR device and more specifically to n semiconctuctor device having the construct ion wherein the heat generated from a semi conductor wafer is transferred to a heat sink via an eleetrioally insulative member. A semiconductor wafer such as a power transistor usrd for power amplification or for large current control generates high heat because the current to be controlled is great. To remove this heat, the semiconductor wafer of thin kind is generally secured to a heat sink via a thermally conductive, electrically insulative member such as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,025,437 . Securement is generally efrected by soldering. When a solder is used, however, it is difficult to form solder layers between the semiconductor wafer and the electrically insulative member and between the electrically insulative member and the heat sink without gaps so that gaps not filled up with the solder generally referred to as voids are formed inevitably. The voids thus formed in the solder lsYrrr lower the heat transfer.In con sequence, the heat transfer from the semiconductor wafer to the lie at sink becomes insufficient and the semiconductor wafer tends to be broken disadvantageously, On the other hand, there has been known a silver SoLder as a solder material having less occurrence of voids, It iq therefore possible in principle to use tiie silver solder in place of the solder but the problem here is that the brazing temperature of the silver solder is as high as about 8O00C. If the semiconductor wafer i silver soldered to the electrically insulative member and the electrically insulative member is silver soldered to the heat sink at this temperature, there occur again vouch problems, due to the difference of the thermal expansion coefficients of these materials, as curving of the electrically insulative member, occurrence of irregular cracks, and so forth. Curving of the insulative member results in lowering of the heat transfer and cracks result in dielectric breakdown. SUMNAPY OF THE INVENTION It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a semiconductor device having high reliability. It is another object of the present invention to provide a semiconductor device having a reduced occur rence rate of voids. It is still another object of the present invention to provide a semiconductor device which is able to prevent electric breakdown. These objects of the invention can be accomplished by fitting a semiconductor wafer to a heat sink via a thermally conductive, electrically insulative member equipped with slits as claimed in claim 1 or 6 or 11 or 16. In accordance with the present invention, voids that are formed at the time of soldering are reduced because a gas forming such voids is dissipated to the outside through slits disposed on the electrically insulative member. Consequently, as diffusion of the heat generated from the semiconductor wafer is carried out efficiently, it is possible to prevent breakdown of the semiconductor wafer and to improve its reliability.

The power transistor chip 100 and the molybdenum sheet 120 are secured via a solder layer 200 while the molybdenum layer 120 and the first heat sink 140 are secured via a silver solder layer 220. The electrically insulative plate 300 is interposed and secured between the first and second heat sinks 140 and 160 via solder layers 240 and 260, respectively. In the semiconductor device 10 in accordance with the present invention, the first heat sink 140 may be removed so that the insulative plate 300 may be secured between the molybdenum sheet 120 and the second heat sink 160 via the solder layer. A 1 traced in Figure 2A, the insulative plate 300 comprises an insulative plate blank 320, metallized faces 340 formed on both sides of the blank 320 and slits 360 formed on one side or on both sides of the insulative plate blank 320. Though the insulative plate blank 320 in this embodiment consists of alumina, it may be made of beryllium. The metallized faces 340 are formed by the steps of first forming the slits 360, coAting then tungsten onto both faces of the alumina blank and similtaneously baking both alumina and tungsten. ITickel plating is further applied to both faces in consideration of wettability with respect to a solder mate rial. The slits 360 are disposed in the longitudinal direction of the insulative plate blank 320 and in the at directions failing right angles thereto in the crisscross form before the metallized faces 340 are formed on the insulative plate blank 320. In this case, the number of slits in the longitudinal direction may be smaller than that of slits in the directions meeting at right angles to the longitudinal direction see Figure 2B . The heat transfer between the first heat sink 140 and the second heat sink 160 is effected via the metallized faces 340. if the number of slits is too great, tere fore, the total area of the metallized faces 340 will decrease and hence, the heat transfer rate will also decrease. If the number of slits is too small, on the contrary, dissipation of the gas, which is taken into the solder layer at the time of soldering, is not sufficient so that voids are more easily formed and the heat transfer rate will decrease. Experiments have revealed that when the thickness of alumina is l mm, good heat transfer rate can be obtained by disposing the slits in the crins cross arrangement so that each zone on the metallized face becomes 3mm 4mm. A preferred shape of the slit 360 to be formed on the insulative plate blank 320 has a notch having a Ushaped cross sectional shape as shown in Figure 3A.Other preferred shapes of the slit are also shown inFigures 3B and 30. The slit 362 shown in Figure 3A is formed by press working the insulative plate blank 320 using a press or the like so as to form a notch having a g or U shaped cross section. In this case, the metallized face 340 is formed at the portions other than the slit portion 362. The slit 3 shorn in Figure 33 is formed in the same way so as to be provided with a notch having a V shaped cross section.Unlike the slits 362 and 364 shown respectively in Figures 3A and 3B, the t 366 shown in Figure 3C is constructed by a gap which is defined between divided metallized faces by forming the metallized faces 340 dividingly into plural units on the insulative plate blank 320. Each of the slit structures shown in Figures 3A, 33 and 3C defines an escape passage of a gas which is entrapped in a solder layer when the insulative plate 5 is soldered to the heat sinks 140 and 160, and allows the gas to escape to the outside. hence, occurrence of the voids due to the gas is reduced. Each of the slit structures shown in Figures 3A and 313 has the notch on which thermal stress is apt to concentrate. Since the notches are not covered with the metallized faces 340, even when the insulative plate 300 is silver soldered to the heat sinks 140 and 160 at a temperature of 8000C., thermal contraction arising from the differences in the thermal expansion coefficients of the varying materials is apt to concentrate on the notches and is absorbed by them. Where the thermal contraction is so great as to exceed an allowable limit, the thermal contraction concentrates exclusively on the notches of the slits 362 and 3641 thereby causing cracks, but electric insulation remains unaffected because the slit portions are not coated with the metallized faces.For this reason, it is possible to prevent dielectric breakdown due to high temperature soldering. Figure 4 shown the comparison between the total void rate 400 void occurring area area of insulative plate of the semiconductor device 10 having the insulative plate 300 equipped with the slits 360 in accordance with the present invention and the total void rate 420 of the prior art semiconductor device having the conventional insul At ive plate. In Figure 4, the ordinate represents the total void rate 36 and the abscissa does the zones of the semiconductor device.As can be appreciated from Figure is, the total void rate, which haa conventionally been 5X, can be reduced down to 396. This improves the reliability of the semiconductor device and eliminates the necessity of quality inspection of the semiconductor device by means of Roentgen inspection which has been indispensable conventionally. In the foregoing explanation, both faces of the insulative plate 300 are secured to the heat sinks 140 and 160 by soldering. However, the present invention is not specifically limited to this embodiment so that one side may be secured by soldering while the other, by silver kiering, for example. Furthermore, both sides may be secured by silver soldering. 340 The metallized face niay be formed sufficiently only on the side to which soldering is to be applied. In the case of silver solder ng, it becomes unnecessary. It is preferred that the slits 360 to be formed on 300 the insulative plate are disposed on the insulative plate on the side which is to be soldered. In the case of silver soldering, the slits may be formed sufficiently on only one side, though silver so dering is applied on both sides of the insulative plate.
