## Description
SEPARABLE BOTTOM END STOP ASSEMBLY FOR SEPARABLE SLIDE FASTENER The present invention relates to a separable bottom end stop assembly for a separable slide fastener. iae fasteners in which a separable bottom end stop assembly of thermoplastic synthetic resin is mounted on adjacent bottom ends of opposed fastener stringers. The separable bottom end stop assembly generally comprises a pair of pin members secured to the inner tape margins at their respective bottom end portions, and a socket member secured to one of the pin members. In some of the on bottom end stop assemblies, the socket member is attached to one of the pin members by snap action, and in the otters, the socket member is fused with one of the pin members b using an ultrasonic horn, for example. However, in the former case, adequately firm attachment of the socket member cannot be achieved yet, increasing the amount of snap action strength causes uneasy insertion of the pin member into a bore of the socket member. The one pin member thus tends to be inclined relative to the socket member to assume an improper posture. Consequently, accurate and reliable assembling of such prior bottom end stop components cannot be carried out by a fully automated assembling machine and must be done by a well experienced person who operatesvarious separate tools or devices, which is laborious and time consuming. n the latter case, although the one pin member can be inserted into the socket member s bore easily, but it is difficult to place the one pin member exactly in position relative to the socket member. Therefore, this prior bottom end stop assembly also cannot be assembled by a fully automated machine. According to the present invention, a separable bottom ena stop assembly for a sepa ate slide fastener including a pair of fastener stringers, each including a stringer tape carrying on its inner longitudinal margin a row of couplingelements, the inner tape margin having a bottom end port on devoid of coupling elements, said assembly comprising a first pin member of thermoplastic synthetic resin adapted te be secured to the bottom end portion of the inner tape margin of one stringer a second pin member of thermoplastic synthetic resin adapted to be secured to the bottom end portion of the inner tape margin of the other stringer a socket member of thermoplastic synthetic resin secured to said first pin member and having a pair of flanged wings joined by a partition wall to define between said wings a first and second bore for receiving a portion of said first pin member and a portion of said second pin member, respectively, said partition wall having a central bulge swelling into said first bore for resiliently pressing said first pin member, when the latter is inserted into said first bore, against said inss f flanges nat tAv define said first bore and one of said first pin member and said socket member having a pair of recesses, the other of said first pin member and said socket member having a pair of projections each adapt to be received in a respectIve one of sala recesses in said first pin member when said socket member is secured to said first pin member. The preset invention seeks to provide a separable bottom end stop assembly in which the socket member can be attached to one of the pin members easily and accurately with adequate firmness. The present invention further seeks to provide a separable bottom end stop assembly which can be assembled by a fully automated machine. Still another object of the invention is to provide a separable bottom end stop assembly in which one of the pin members can be inserted into the socket member s bore easily and reliably without lateral displacement. Many other advantages, features and additional objects of the present invention will become manifest to those versed in the art upon making reference to the detailed description and the accompanying drawings in which preferred embodiments incorporating the principles of the present invention are shown by way of illustrative example.

Figure 1 shows a separable slide fastener 1 comprising a pair of fastener stringers each including a stringer tape 2, 3 carrying on and along its inner longitudinal margin 2a, 3a a row of coupling elements 7 in the form of separate scoops made of thermoplastic synthetic resin. A separable bottom end stop assembly 100 is mounted on adjacent bottom ends of the stringers at the respective bottom end portions of the confronting inner tape margins 2a, 3a. The bottom end portion is devoid of several coupling elements 7, the number of which is not pertinent here. A slider not shown is threaded on the opposed coupling element rows 7, 7 for movement therealong to close and open the slide fastener 1. As shown in Figures 1 4, the separable bottom end stop assembly 100 includes a firs separate pin member 5 of thermoplastic synthetic resin mounted on the bottom end portion of one of the inner tape margins 2a by Injection molding, a secona separate pin member 6 of thermoplastic synthetic resin mounted on the bottom end portion of the other inner tape margin 3a by injection molding, and a socket member 4 of thermoplastic synthetic resin secured to the first pin member 5 by fusing in a manner described below. S shown in inure A, the socket member 4 has a pair of flanged upper and lower wings 10, 11 joined by a partition wall 14 extending centrally of the wings 10, 11 to define a first longitudinal through bore 15 and a second blind bore 16 for receiving a portion of the first pin member 5 and a portion of the second pin member 6, respectively. The socket member 4 has a pair of slits 17, 17, each communicating with a respective one of the first and second bore 15, 16, for receiving the respective stringer tapes 2, 3, as shown in Figure 2. The partition wall 14 has a central bulge 19 swelling into the first bore 15 for resiliently urging or pressing the first pin member 5 against the flanges 13, 13 of the upper and lower wings 10, 11 when the first pin member 5 is inserted into the first bore 15.In an alternative form shown in Figure 9, the partition wall 14 has in the central bulge 19 a slot 20 extending from a top end of the partition wail 14 and terminating short of a bottom end of the partition wall 14. In an another alternative for shown in FIgure iO, W central bulge 19 of the partition wall 14 has a thickness smaller than the other portions of partition wall 14. Each of the wings 10, 11 has in its inner face a groove 28 extending along the base of the partition wall 14 and opening into the first bore 15, facilitating the deforming of the partition wall 14 when the first pin member 5 is forced into the first bore 15, as described below in connection with Figures 3A, 8B and 8C. The socket member 4 also has at its top end a pair of opposed projections 18, 18 extending from respective inner faces of the upper and lower wings 10, 11 into the first bore 15, for a purpose described below. The first pin member 5 includes an upper portion 23 and a lower portion 24 having a thickness slightly smaller than not only the thickness of the upper portion 23 but also the distance between the upper and lower wings 10, 11.When the socket member 4 is secured to the first pin member 5, the lower portion 24 of the first pin member 5 is received in the first bore 15. The first pin member 5 also has in opposite faces a pair of recesses 25, 25 for receiving the respective projections 18 of the upper and lower wings 10, 11 when the socket member 4 is secured to the first pin ember 5, as shown in Figures 1, 3 and 7. Each of the recesses 25 is disposed across to the border between the upper and lower portions 23, 24. The lower portion 24 of the first pin member 5 has on its opposite faces a plurality of ridges 24a Figures 4 and 5 . The ridges 24a are melted and fused with the inner faces of the upper and lower wings 10, 11 when the socket member 4 and the first pin member 5 are ,cined together by applying heat and pressure in a manner described below in connection with Figure 7. The second pin member 6 Figure 1 has a recess 27 for receiving a projection 26 of the first pin member 5 when the first and second pin members 5, 6 are placed exactly in position for ccrrect interengaging of the opposed coupling element rows 7, 7 of the two stringers. To attach the socket member 4 to the first pin member 5, the first pin member 5 of Figure 4 is inserted into the first bore 15 of the socket member 4 Figures 4 and 6 from the top end thereof. At that time the socket member 4, which has in its free form a thickness tl Figure 8A , is expanded or deformed so as to have an increased thickness t2 Figure 8B . Then the socket member 4 recovers as the projection 18, 18 of the upper and lower wings 10, 11 are received in the recesses 15, 15, respectively, of the first pin member 5, finally the upper and lower wings 10, 11 are compressed between an ultransonic horn 30 and a coacting anvil 31, as shown n Figure causing the central bulge 19 to resilien urge or press the first pin member 5 against the flanges 13, 13 the upper and lower wIngs 10, 11.As a result, the socket member 4 is integrally joined with the first pin member 5 by fusing at 32, 33 Figures 2 and 3 , at which time the ridges 94a of the first pin member 5 are melted and fused with the inner faces of the upper and lower wings 10, 11. The resultant socket member 4 has thickness t3 Fugure 8C slightly smaller than the thickness t1. With this arrangement, the socket member 4 can be attached to the first pin member 5 easily and accurately with adequate firmness, partly because the first pin member 5 is resiliently pressed by the central bulge 19 of the partition wall 14 against the flanges 13, 13 of the upper and lower wings 10, 11, and partly because the projections 18 18 of the wings 10, 11 are received in the respective recesses 25, 25, of the first pin member 5. In a modification shown in Figure 11, the first pin erper 5 has on its opposite faces a pair of jections 18 18 and each of the upper and lower winces 10, 11 or tne socket member 4 has an opening or recess 25 communicating with the first bore 15 for receiving a respective one of the projection 18 . The first pin member 5 also has a longitudinal groove 5a receptive of a portion of the partition wall s central bulge 19. Figure 12 illustrates another modification in which each of the upper and lower wings 10, 11 has on its inner face a plurality of parallel longitudinal guide ridges 35 Figures 12 15 facing the firs bore 15 or being slidably engageable with a respective oneof opposite faces of the first pin member 5 while the latter is inserted into the first bore 15. The lower portion 24 cf the first pin member 5 is flat at opposite faces and has a thickness substantially equal to the distance between the upper and lower wings 10, 11. As shown in Figures 14, 15, each of the guide ridges 35 has a height decreasing progress vely toward a bottcm end of the socket member 4 or facilitating the inserting of the first pin merber into the first bore 15. The maximum height of the guide ridges 35 is slightly smaller than the height of projections 18. The first pin member 5 also has one or more additional ridges 36 projecting from a bottom face of each recess 25 and having a height slightly smaller than the depth of the recess 25. The socket member 4 is integrally joined with the first pin member 5 when the upper and lower wings 10, 11 are compressed between the ultrasonic horn 30 and the coaction anvil 31, as shown in Figure 15, at which time the ridges 35 of the wings 10, 11 are melted and fused with the opposite faces of the first pin member 5. At the same time, the ridges 36 of the first pin member 5 also are melted and fused with the respective projections 18, 1e of the wings 1, li. Alternatively, each of the guide ridges 35 may be composed of a plurality of spaced segments 35a, as shown in Figure 16.
