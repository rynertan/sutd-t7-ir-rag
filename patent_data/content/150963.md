# SIGNAL PROCESSING CIRCUIT FOR PAL COLOUR TELEVISION SIGNALS

## Abstract
A two delay line 2,3 PAL t.v. signal decoder in which the input composite signal, A, and the one and two line delayed sig nals B and C, are combined 10, 11, 14 to provide signals A B 2B and C A 90 , both having zero vertical luminance, these signals then being added and substracted 15, 16 to pro duce two signals H, I respectively having only the u and only the v chrominance component, for separate demodulation. With this arrangement, both cross colour on vertical luminance and Hanover bars are suppressed in the decoder output. The signal A C 2B and a signal A C are also individually recti fied 22,25 and then combined 26,27,28 to produce an out put control signal MC to modify the decoding mode for verti cal colour transitions but not for signals consisting only of verti cal luminance in the chrominance band.
