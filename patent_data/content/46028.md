# Imaging process and article employing photolabile, blocked surfactant.

## Abstract
A photosensitive element is provided by an actinic radiation transmissive film forming polymeric material which contains photolabile blocked surfactant capable upon exposure to actinic radiation of releasing a detectable quantity of surfactant in actinic radiation exposed areas in areas not exposed to actinic radiation and unblocked surfac tant in an image wise pattern in the actinic radiation exposed areas. An imaging process is also provided comprising providing the actinic radiation sensitive element and expos ing the actinic radiation sensitive element to actinic radiation in an image wise pattern at an intensity and for a time sufficient to release an image wise pattern of released surfactant in the exposed area.
