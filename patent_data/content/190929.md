# APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR FABRICATING A LOW VOLTAGE WINDING FOR A TOROIDAL TRANSFORMER

## Abstract
A winding apparatus and method for fabricating a multifilar low volatage winding for a toroidal transformer is disclosed. The method and apparatus use a wire storage magazine 18 and a wire winding shuttle 20 which rotate about a semitoroidal winding mandrel 38 to wind a multifiliar low volatage winding 48 on the winding mandrel having a greater radial depth of turns at the radially inward leg of the winding than at the radially outward leg of the winding. The multifilar winding can be wound with a group of conductors in a single pass over the winding mandrel, or wound one conductor at a time using multiple passes over the winding mandrel, or wound using multiple passes over the winding mandrel with some intermediate number of conductors being wound during each pass.
