# Silicate superionic conductors and method of making same.

## Abstract
The spray drying of a feed liquid mixture containing dissolved feed elements is used to produce precursor powders of Na super conducting sodium gadolinium silicate Na₅GdSi₄O₁₂ , NGS , and sodium yttrium silicate Na₅YSi₄O₁₂ , NYS. Using these powders, very dense 97 theoretical solids are obtained on sintering. The resistivities of the NGS and NYS polycrystalline ceramics are 5 and 7 Ω cm respectively at 300 C and are dependent on the f NGS or f NYS values. In the case of NYS, the resistivity f NYS relationship takes the form
