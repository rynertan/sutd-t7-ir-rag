# X ray film holding device.

## Abstract
Swingable front and back plates 72, 74 are supported by a hinge. Cushion members 84, 85 are pasted individually on the inner surfaces of the front and back plates 72, 74 . The cushion members 84, 86 individually have two dimensional curved surfaces with the same radius of curvature, and are arranged so that the directions of curvature of their curved surfaces cross substantially at right angles. Intensifying screens 92, 94 curved to match the surfaces of the cushion members are pasted thereon. An X ray film is sandwiched between the intensifying screens 92, 94 , and the front and back plates 72, 74 are joined together. Thereupon, the region of each cushion member 84, 86 , pressing the X ray film through its corresponding intensifyirtg screens 92, 94 , extends gradually, moving its center from the hinge side to the free end side. When the front andback plates 72, 74 are joined together, the X ray film recieves a maximum pressing force from the center of each cushion member 84, 86 . The pressing force decreases with radial distance from the center.
