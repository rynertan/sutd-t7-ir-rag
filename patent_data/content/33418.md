# Ventricular synchronised atrial pacemaker.

## Abstract
An atrial pacemaker having an atrial pacing rate adjusted to correspond to a detected ventricular heart rate to maintain A V synchrony in a range between a minimum and maximum pacing rate. Sensed ventricular depolarizations not associ ated with a preceding atrial pacing stimulus cause the atrial pacing rate to be increased. One shots 26, 28, 30 define a period after an atrial pulse on line 11 within which a properly synchronized ventricular pulse should fall. If it does not, a signal on lines 22, 42, CL increases the count in counter 64 which defines the pacing rate. When A V synchrony is restored at a higher rate, the rate is decreased by counter 48 becoming full and providing a count down signal on line 70. Under drive stimulation to treat pathologic tachycardia is achieved as the atrial pacing rate is increased in steps to the maximum pacing rate, normally lower than typical tachycar dia rates.
