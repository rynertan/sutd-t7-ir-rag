# Stabilization of flame retardant polycarbonate polyester compositions.

## Abstract
Blends of an aromatic polycarbonate a polyester, a halogenated flame retardant agent and a metal oxide synergist for the flame retardant are made more stable against transesterification reactions during high temperature processing by the inclusion of minor amounts of selected phosphorus containing compounds, such as phosphorous acid or acid salt.
