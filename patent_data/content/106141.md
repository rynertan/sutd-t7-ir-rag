# Catalyst components and catalysts for the polymerization of olefins.

## Abstract
Catalyst components for the stereoregular polymeriza ton of alpha olefins, comprising a Ti halide and an electron donor compound supported on an anhydrous magnesium dihalide and obtained by means of non extractive treat ments, with liquids having a dielectric constant at 20 C equal to or higher than 2, of compositions comprising an anhyd rous Mg dihalide, the crystallites of which have an average size lower than 300 Ã….
