# DYNAMOELECTRIC MACHINE

## Abstract
A dynamoelectric machine having a rotor formed from continuous strip of ferrous material and a continuous helically formed conductor thereon. The rotor having a rectangular cross section is mounted on the periphery of a web member. The web member is axially mounted for rotation about a frame and supports a fan. The stator of the machine is axially aligned with the outer circumferential surface of the rotor and provides support for pairs of permanent magnets and an equal number of pairs of brushes. The field magnets are positioned to magnetically link with the winding on the rotor. The brushes are equally and angularly spaced in the frame and operative contact with a commutator integrally formed with the rotor winding.
