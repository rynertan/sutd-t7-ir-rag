# Improved method of making dimensionally stable composite board.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a method of making a dimensionally stable composite board product made from a mixture of particles of a cellulose material and binder and a composite board so produced by such method. Dimensional stability is in reference to the resistance to thickness swelling when the board is subjected to high humidity or moisture conditions. The method and composite board displaying the attribute of improved dimensional stability involves subjecting the parti cles of cellulosic material to a pressurized steam treatment and then making the composite board under heat and pressure. When compared to conventional composite board that has not been subjected to the pretreatment, the difference in thickness swelling is significant.

## Description
IMPROVED METHOD OF MAKING DIMENSIONALLY STABLE COMPOSITE BOARD AND COMPOSITE BOARD PRODUCED BY SUCH METHOD The present invention relates to an improved process of making synthetic board and boards produced therefrom wherein the final product i.e., the formed board has improved dimensional stability under varying moisture conditions and more particularly to pretreating the ligno cellulosic materials and using the pretreated material in making the boards. The technologies of manufacturing wood based composites have been continuously improved. It is no longer an imagination but a reality that wood based composites can be produced stronger and stiffer than plywood, solid wood and laminated wood. The production rate has also been significantly increased through the advances in resin technologies. However, in many applications, wood based composites are much inferior to plywood, solid wood and laminated wood due to lack of dimensional stability. Therefore it is not exaggerated to have a statement the most severe drawback of wood based composites is lack of dimensional stability . For panel products, the mat is usually formed in such a way that the grain direction of furnish is normally parallel to the panel surfaces and the pressure direction is perpendicular thereto. The furnish is compressed in the thickness direction. Consequently, the thickness direction is the most unstable direction in wood based panels. The thickness swelling of wood based compdsYtho vo panels consists of reversible and irreversible swelling when the panels absorb water or moisture. The former is due to the hygroscopic nature of wood and the latter is due to the springback of compressed wood. The reversible swelling is normally less than the solid wood because the hygroscopicity of wood is reduced by heat during hot pressing. The irreversible swelling is the main cause of instability of woodbased composites. Therefore, the irreversible swelling must be radically reduced in order to improve the dimensional stability of wood based composites drastically. Irreversible swelling results from the release of pent up internal stresses in the composite upon adsorbation of water or moisture. Therefore it is reasonable to believe that highly stable composites can be produced if the composite is made in such a way that internal stresses are minimized during pressing. Thickness swelling of wood based composite board is undesirable particularly where such boards are used in exterior applications and other applications where uncontrolled moisture conditions exist. The dimensional stability of a composite board or panel is normally determined by measuring the thickness swelling of the panel and or linear expansion following controlled exposure to moisture. Conventional wood based composite boards or panels can experience a thickness swelling ranging from 10 to 25 of the panel s thickness following a horizontal 24 hour cold water soak and which can range from 20 to 40 percent if subjected to a vertical 24 hour cold water soak, When subjecting a conventional panel to a 2 hour boiling period followed by a 1 hour cold water soak, thickness swelling in the range of. 50 to 60 percent can be anticipated. As a result, the use of conventional composite boards and panels as a construction material is limited to installations and environments where the moisture conditions are controlled or anticipated in advance so as to take preventative steps.As a consequence, wood based composites are regarded as undesirable for exterior applications and particularly ground contact applications because of differential dimensional changes between the wet and dry portions of the material below and above the ground. The moisture and moisture cycling effect experienced by composite panels subjected to variations in humidity or exposure to water also contribute to the breakdown or degradation of the panel rendering it unfit as a construction material for the purpose intended. Indeed, building contractors are reluctant to use wood based composite panels as a flooring or sub flooring since the marginal edges of a panel can exhibit greater thickness swelling over its central portion which detracts from a substantially planer abutment joint with neighboring panels. The dimensional stability i.e. thickness change of waferboard or other composites can be improved by increasing the resin content, press time or press temperature. Increases in resin content dramatically increase the production costs and therefore is undesirable. Increasing press time also is undesirable from a production cost point of view and therefore not considered effective. Increase of press temperature is effective but results in a fire hazard and therefore again is undesirable. A principle object of the present invention is to provide a process for producing highly stable wood based composite board without resorting to high pressure or high temperature treatments and without increasing resin content or resorting to special high cost resin binders. Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for producing highly stable and bond durable products and products produced by such process which can be further treated with preservatives, fire retardants or other chemicals without causing significant damage to strength and excessive thickness swelling. In accordance with the present invention, furnish i.e. wood chips are exposed to a pressure steam treatment and thereafter formed into a mat which is subjected to a pressure and heat to form a synthetic board. Un . expertly applicants have discovered considerable improved dimensional stability of the so formed composite board where the starting material has been pressure treated i.e. pretreatment of the furnish before forming the rigid board. At this time it is not known precisely what takes place in the process but as previously mentioned there is the unusual result obtained of improved dimensional stability.It is believed the purpose of treating furnish is to hydrolize and pyrolize the highly hydroscopic hemicellulose, hydrolyze lignins to smaller molecules to facilitate flow during pressing and mobilize lignins to surfaces to reduce the resistance during hot pressing. While not specificaliy known at this time it is believed the following theories and facts might be applicable. 1. A plastic flow of lignin in situ during hot pressing results in low pent up internal stresses within the product. 2. Steam can hydrolyze lignins and reduce the molecular size of lignins. 3. Smaller molecular size of hydrolyzed lignins permits flow in situ more easily. 4. Control of steam pressure or temperature and treatment time can properly hydrolyze lignins and hemocelluloses without causing significant damage to celluloses. 5. Steam can mobilize lignins to wood surfaces, reduce the rigidity of wood and thus reduce the resistance i.e., less pent up stresses during hot pressing. 6. Steam at high temperature 150 C to 1800C can hydrolyze and pyrolize hemicelluloses which are the most hygroscopic components and thus reduce the reversible swelling. Steam and pressure treatment of fibrous material to form a board dates back to the early 20 s in what is known as the Masonite process. Such process is a multi stage temperature pressure process wherein the chips are exploded through a die or restricted orfice resulting in a pulp called gun stock. In the present process there is no explosion but instead merely a heat pressure treatment of the stock. In carrying out the invention furnish i.e. wood chips or the like is placed in a steam treatment unit such as a high pressure autoclave or a high pressure steam cylinder whereafter the same is closed and injected with steam under pressure which may be saturated steam or dry steam for a short period of time. In utilizing saturated steam the pressure is preferably 225 to 350 psi and the time of the process of course is dependent upon the pressure. The time may for example may be seconds at high pressures such as 350 psi and minutes for lower pressures such as 225 psi or high temperature such as 240 C for higher dry steam. After the pressure treatment the steam pressure is bled down in such a way that the steam pressure will not cause mechanical damage on furnish usually 50 psi or lower if saturated steam is used. The pretreated furnish is thereafter formed into a composite board under pressure and heat, A bin der such as a phenolic resin in amounts conventionally used is normally included in the mat prior to the heat pressure treated ment. The steam pressure temperature and treatment time can be varied to have an optimum combination. For example, treatment time can be as short as 1 minute for steam pressure of 320 psi or treatment time can be as long as 4 minutes to have a proper treatment for steam pressure of 225 psi. In general, the degree of treatment increases linearly with increasing treatment time. Also, there is a rule of thumb that the degree of treatment can be doubled by a rise in steam temperature of lO9C, a temperature coefficient common to many chemical reactions. The following specific examples will further illustrate the practice and advantage of the present invention.Example 1 Waferboards, measuring i x 24 x 24 were fabricated with the following parameters. 1. wafers commercial disk cut wafers 2. wafer thickness normally 0.027 in. 3. wafer length 1.5 in. 4. resin type and content powdered phenolformaldehyde resin, 2.25Z 5. wax type and content slack wax, 1.5Z 6. mat moisture content 3.5Z 7. press time 5 min. including 11 sec. daylight close 8. press temperature 400 F 205DC To make stable boards, wafers were treated with 225 psi pressure of steam for 2, 3 and 4 minutes before drying.

Table 4, Thickness Swelling of Particleboard Bonded with Urea Formaldehyde ResinPretreatment Thickness Surface After Swelling SoakControl 14.6 roughSteam Treatment 7.2 smooth The mat of material from which the boards are formed may be multilayered, for example, consisting of a core with two outer layers. The core layer may be made up from chips which have been pretreated, i.e. by pressure and steam or, alternatively, the two outer layers may be made of chips of the pretreated cellulosic material.If desired all three layers, of course, can be made of the pretreated material. In the instance where the core only is made of the pretreated material and the outer layers are not, a further post treatment can be effected by applying heat to the formed composite board at any time to stabilize the outer layers. In the foregoing the invention has been described by way of example with respect to pressure steam treatment of wood chips and forming boards from the same. The process, however, in its broadest aspect involves pressure steam treatment of ligno cellulosic material irrespective of its physical form. The material herein may be and is referred to as furnish. Furnish is wafers, flakes, particles an ar fibers of wood. These are obtined by conventionally processing trees by chippers, refiners, hammer mills, digesters, autoclaves and or driers. Fiber preparation is one of the most importAnt steps in the process for fiber characteristics which have a predominant effect on the properties of final products.In general, wood chips are processed through a digester system usually consisting of a continuous digester and then discharged into a pressurized refiner. The pressure used in the digester is ranged from 100 to 150 psi g for a few minutes e.g. 2 to 10 min. . The products made from the fibers generated by this process are dimensionally unstable when they are exposed to a high humidity environment or water. That dimensional stability is dramatically improved by treating the wood fibers with moderately high pressure steam. The wood chips can be processed through a refiner and or defibrator in a conventional manner and the pressure steam treatment can be done before or after the defibration and or refining process.There is, however, a minor drawback to pressure steam treating a large quantity of loose fibers in a treatment vessel because of volume the bulk density of fibers is very low, approximately one pound per cubic foot but this can be overcome by compacting the loose fibers prior to pressure steam treatment and then dispersed after treatment. Steam pressure treatment before defibration is more practical and, thus, preferred. The dimensional stability of the final products can be further improved by subjecting the products to a high humidity environment such as 90 percent relative humidity for a predetermined time. This conditioning process will allow the products to expedite most of the irreversible linear expansion in a short period of time without roughening board surfaces or significantly impairing the board quality. This can be done just because the products made from the fibers prepared by the present invention are stable. While specified embodiments of this invention have been disclosed herein, those skilled in the art will appreciate that changes and modifications may be made therein without departing from the concept and scope of this invention 5as defined in the appended claims.
