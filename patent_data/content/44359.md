# Pressure sensitive adhesives and process for forming them.

## Abstract
A pressure sensitive adhesive is formed from a composi tion comprising mono functional unsaturated acrylate ester monomer, essentially saturated tackifying resin polymer dissolved in the acrylate ester, non crystallizing elastomeric material also dissolved in the acrylate ester, and an initiator responsive to ultraviolet light or other penetrating radiation such as electron beam, gamma or X ray radiation. The composition is cured by subjection to ultraviolet light or other radiation, which causes the initiator to induce polymer ization of both the acrylate ester and the non crystallizing elastomeric material, apparently with copolymerization therebetween.
