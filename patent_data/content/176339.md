# OPTICAL THREE DIMENSIONAL DIGITAL DATA ACQUISITION SYSTEM

## Abstract
The range of objects from a television camera is obtained in a static manner by projecting a series of patterns of uniquely coded stripes of light onto the objects at an oblique angle to the optical axis of the camera and by capturing in the camera as pixels the coded light signals reflected by the objects. Through proper selection and scaling of a coordinate system and related coding of the light stripes, the range of the object is determined for each pixel by simply subtracting one coordinate of the pixel from the binary coded light signal reflected into the pixel.
