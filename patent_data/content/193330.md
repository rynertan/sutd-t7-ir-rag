## Description
The present invention is concerned with hyaluronidases. The name hyaluronidase is used for an important group of enzymes which degrade certain tissues polysaccharides glycosaminoglycans . There are basically two types of hyaluronidases a those which are relatively non specific and cleave hyaluronic acid, chondroitin and related polysaccharides and b those which specifically cleave hyaluronic acid. Hyaluronic acid is a polysaccharide widely found in the extracellular connective tissue of animals. As the cement which binds cells together, the main constituent of the vitreous of the eye, and functionally important in joints, etc, hyaluronic acid is of considerable physiological importance. An enzyme which specifically cleaves hyaluronic acid should have a wide variety of medical and scientific applications. Hyaluronidases are widely distributed in nature in for example, mammalian testes, liver and spleen and in certain microorganisms. Mammalian hyaluronidases are of the first type that is, they cleave non specifically hyaluronic acid, chondroitin and other polysaccharides. Other hyaluronidases of the second type that is, hyaluronic acid specific , are derived from microorganisms such as The β glucuronidase identified by Linker et al has been further characterised by Yuki and Fishman 1963 J. Biol Chem 238 pp 1877 9 as having optimum activity at pH 6.0. There has been little subsequent published work concerning the hyaluronidase derived from We have now isolated a novel hyaluronic acid specific endo β glucuronidase from buffalo leeches the term buffalo leech is a broad term comprising the sub family According to the invention, therefore, there is provided an endo β glucuronidase derived from leeches of the sub family The endo β glucuronidase according to the invention is hyaluronic acid specific that is, capable of cleaving hyaluronic acid, but not chondroitin, chondroitin 4 sulphate, chondroitin 6 sulphate or heparin . Furthermore, the enzyme has been found to be incapable of cleaving fibronectin, and is therefore considered to be substantially free of protease activity. The known endo β glucuronidase derived from The endo β glucuronidase derived from the buffalo leech is characterised by improved heat stability compared with that derived from The endo β glucuronidase derived from the buffalo leech is further characterised by improved activity under extreme pH conditions compared with that derived from The endo β glucuronidase derived from buffalo leeches is still further characterised by its behaviour in the presence of HgCl₂. At low concentrations 10µM HgCl₂ , the endo β glucuronidase derived from buffalo leeches was substantially completely inactivated, whereas under the some conditions, the endo β glucuronidase derived from Neither the endo β glucuronidase derived from buffalo leeches which may be, for example, of the species The endo β glucuronidase according to the invention has been found to comprise a polypeptide of molecular weight 28,500 3,000 in non reduced form ,when measured by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide electrophoresis using a polyacrylamide gel of gradient 3 to 15 . This is a low molecular weight compared with molecular weights of other hyaluronidases. Such a molecular weight corresponds to about 285 amino acid units, which makes the endo β glucuronidase particularly suitable for syntheses, manipulation or modification by either protein engineering or genetic engineering. The present invention accordingly further comprises the synthetic enzyme corresponding to the endo β glucuronidase isolated from buffalo leeches and having substantially the same characteristics and activity, particularly with respect to its hyaluronic acid specificity. Where we refer herein to endo β glucuronidase derived from buffalo leeches, of course, we intend to encompass the genetically engineered material which is inevitably derived from the leech in the sense that it is first necessary to have a source of the enzyme isolated from the leech before further enzyme can be genetically engineered either directly from leech derived DNA or RNA, or indirectly by means of a synthetic gene encompassing all or part of the original DNA sequence. There is further provided by the present invention a method of preparation of an endo beta glucuronidase as hereinbefore described, which method comprises extracting tissue from leeches of the sub family It is preferred that the extraction solvent comprises an ammonium sulphate solution. It is further preferred that the extract is purified by gel chromatography and then concentrated or dehydrated. The endo beta glucuronidase derived from the buffalo leech further differs from that derived from The activity of an endo beta glucuronidase can be expressed in standard units one unit corresponds to the reducing power of glucuronic acid glucose equivalent in micrograms liberated per hour from hyaluronic acid at optimum pH. The endo beta glucuronidase according to the invention has an activity of approximately 3500 units per leech compared with about 233 units per leech reported for the hyaluronidase isolated from As indicated, the endo beta glucuronidase according to the invention is highly specific for and highly active against, hyaluronic acid. Such a potent and stable enzyme has a variety of possible uses, as follows In connection with use in therapy, the endo β glucuronidase according to the invention generally acts as a dispersal agent or spreading factor or aids penetration through the skin a percutaneous factor . The present invention further comprises a pharmaceutical or veterinary formulation comprising a hyaluronic acid specific endo β glucuronidase and an acceptable diluent, carrier or excipient. Examples of such pharmaceutical or veterinary uses include, but are not restricted to the following In order that the present invention may be more fully understood, the following Examples are given by way of illustration only. The head region of a buffalo leech of the species Stage II was prepared by adding 40 saturated ammonium sulphate to stage I supernatant centrifuging the suspension at 800g for 20 minutes at 4 C, and then adding to the resultant supernatant ammonium sulphate to 80 saturation. The suspension was centrifuged at 800g for 20 minutes at 4 C the pellet being resuspended in a 50 saturated solution of ammonium sulphate, and centrifuged at 800g for 20 minutes at 4 C. The supernatant was then dialyzed three times against distilled water at 4 C, the dialysate being centrifuged at 2600g for 20 minutes at 4 C to remove precipitates, resulting in stage II enzyme.A percentage yield of 20 from stage I to stage II was obtained. The resulting hyaluronidase was a remarkably stable enzyme which retained its activity following a diversity of storage conditions After one year in the freezer,stage II preparation retains 50 of its activity. Increased activity following freezing is interpreted as physical release of enzyme from encapsulating granules, or similar phenomenon.. The hyaluronidase has optimum activity in the pH range 4.5 to 5.5 malic acid with ionic strength in the range 0.1 0.2 molar and was specific for hyaluronic acid. The mode of action of the hyaluronidase was examined in a test in which the total reducing sugar was detected by the 3,5 dinitrosalicylic acid assay. The resultant reducing sugar produced by the enzyme action was After incubation of endo β glucuronidase with urine at 37 C for 1 hour, the hyaluronic acid content was measured by assay of the glucose reducing equivalents released during the incubation. Measurements of between 40 and 80 g hyaluronic acid per ml urine were routinely obtained. Before incubation the urine was first dialysed against distilled water at 4 C for 24 hours to remove all reducing sugars. The enzyme was stable for at least 4 hours in dialysed or undialysed urine and did not require the presence of a buffering material for near maximal activity. The endo β glucuronidase according to the invention can be used in assaying levels of hyaluronic acid of a variety of body fluids including urine, plasma, saliva, synovial fluid and aqueous humor. The molecular weight of the hyaluronidase was determined by treatment with sodium dodecyl sulphate SDS followed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Samples 5000 units per ml of hyaluronidase derived from A measurement of 28,500 3,000 daltons was obtained for the protein in the sample which represented 80 of the total protein. In order to ensure that this protein was the hyaluronidase, a sample of hyaluronidase which had not been heated to 100 C in SDS was run on a 7 resolving gel which was overlaid with 0.5 mg per ml hyaluronic acid. Digestion of hyaluronic acid was followed by use of Alcian blue, a dye by which hyaluronic acid is detectable as a blue stain. The protein responsible for hyaluronic acid digestion in the gel indicated by the lack of blue stain was excised from the gel, minced and heated with SDS at 100 C. It was then run adjacent to a control sample of SDS hyaluronidase. The protein responsible for hyaluronic acid digestion was found to correlate with that at 28,500 3,000 daltons. Samples of hyaluronidase derived either from buffalo leech or After preincubation for 30 minutes at 50 C, the buffalo leech hyaluronidase retained at least 70 of its activity whereas that from Similarly, after preincubation at 60 C for 10 minutes the hyaluronidase from the buffalo leech retained at least 25 of its activity while that from Samples of hyaluronidase derived either from buffalo leech or At both acid and alkaline extremes of pH an inhibition of activity was observed in the activity of both hyaluronidases. The extent of the inhibition and its reversibility differed substantially however between the two enzymes. That from buffalo leech retained at least 50 of its maximal activity at pH 3.5 whereas that from To assess whether the inhibition of the enzymes at pH 9.0 represented irreversible inactivation the mixtures at pH 9.0 were subsequently brought to pH 5.0 and reincubated at 37 C for 1 hour. When then assayed for glucose reducing equivalents produced, it was found that the hyaluronidase activity from the buffalo leech was still present while that from The head region of 40 buffalo leeches of the species Stage II was prepared by adding 40 saturated ammonium sulphate to stage I supernatant centrifuging the suspension at 800g for 20 minutes at 4 C, and then adding to the resultant supernatant ammonium sulphate to 80 saturation. The suspension was centrifuged at 800g for 20 minutes at 4 C the pellet being resuspended in a 50 saturated solution of ammonium sulphate, and centrifuged at 800g for 20 minutes at 4 C. The supernatant was then dialyzed three times against distilled water at 4 C, the dialysate being centrifuged at 2600g for 20 minutes at 4 C to remove precipitates, resulting in stage II enzyme. A percentage yield of 20 from stage I to stage II was obtained. Similar results were obtained when the enzyme was extracted from non cephalic tissue. The activity measured at each step and the recovery as a percentage of the activity at stage I are given below. Activity of the hyaluronidase was measure by incubation at 37 C for 1 hour in 20mM Na citrate, 0.1M NaCl and 1mg per ml hyaluronic acid. One unit is defined as that amount of enzyme activity that produces 1 µg of glucose reducing equivalents from hyaluronic acid in 1 hour at 37 C. To further purify the stage II enzyme samples containing 15,000 to 20,000 units were applied to a Sephadex G100 column height 93 cm, volume 187 cm³ . The column was eluted with 50mM Tris HCl pH 7.0, 20 mM NaCl at 1.6 ml per mimute at an operating pressure of 108 cm H₂O. The hyaluronidase was eluted between 65 minutes and 105 minutes with a peak of maximal activity obtained at 85 minutes. Recoveries off the column were between 90 and 110 . The fraction collected represented stage III. Typical examples of the specific activity of the enzyme per mg protein are given below. Vitreous humors of cows eyes were removed and suspended separately in 20mM MES, 0.1M NaCl pH 5.0 in a final volume of 10ml. Measurement of the glucose reducing equivalents present initially gave a reading of zero. The mean fresh weight of each humor was 2.75g. To one humor 5000 units of hyaluronidase from buffalo leech was added. To another was added 5000 units of hyaluronidase as well as 2mg hyaluronic acid. The latter was used as a control to determine that digestion of hyaluronic acid could occur under the After incubation for one hour at 37 C the mixture containing humor incubated solely with hyaluronidase contained a total of 3.38 mg glucose equivalents while the other with added hyaluronic acid contained 4.68 mg. These results confirm that presence of significant amounts of hyaluronic acid in the vitreous humor which can be digested by a hyaluronidase of the endo β glucuronidase type. This accords with use of the enzyme as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of hyaluronic acid related eye disorders.
