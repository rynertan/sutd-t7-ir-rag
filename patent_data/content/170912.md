## Description
The present invention relates to an integrated circuit having a common input terminal for a plurality of circuit blocks receiving signals via the common input terminal. The integration density of integrated circuits has been increased and the number of elements and functional circuits fabricated in the same integrated circuit chip has become large. On the other hand, the number of external terminals provided in one integrated circuit chip has been limited in view of topographical layout of the chip and yields of production. Under such circumstance, it has been proposed that one external terminal is commonly utilized by two or more circuit blocks included in the same chip. For example, in the multi strobe type dynamic memory in which row address signals and column signals are taken through the same set of address terminals in response to a row address strobe However, according to the above technique, since the common external terminal is directly connected to a plurality of circuit blocks, the capacitance associated to the common external terminal is inevitably very large, resulting in low speed operations. Moreover, each of the circuit blocks is provided with a special control circuit which prevents the circuit block from being affected by unnecessary input through the common external terminal after conducting it relevant function. This has made the respective circuit blocks complicated. An integrated circuit according to the preamble part of claim 1 is disclosed in FR A 2 533 738. This integrated circuit comprises a dynamic memory in which one of four drivers is connected to an input buffer through one of four gate circuits, wherein selection of the gate circuits is made in accordance with address signals. Therefore, once the state of the address signals is established, the connection between the input buffer and the drivers is determined so that control of the gates according to the states of the respective functional circuits to which input signals are selectively applied is not performed. It is therefore an object of the invention to provide an integrated circuit in which a plurality of circuit blocks share the same external terminal which can operate at high speed and which can be fabricated an highly integrated structure. This object is achieved by an integrated circuit as defined by claim 1. According to the invention at least one circuit block is selectively isolated from the external terminal, wherein the gates are controlled by the states of the respective functional circuits to which input signals are selectively applied therethrough and hence the effective load capacitance associated to the external terminal is significantly reduced. Moreover since the circuit block is selectively isolated from the external terminal and the circuit block is not sensitive to the signal at the external terminal depending on the states of the respective functional circuit the signal at the external terminal does not adversely effect the circuit block. Referring to Fig. 1, an integrated circuit according to the prior art is briefly explained. A plurality of circuit blocks 11 to 1 Furthermore, since the signal ψ is always applied to the respective circuit blocks, each of the circuit blocks has to be provided with circuit means for rendering the internal circuit not shown included therein insensitive to the operation of the input transistor when the circuit block do not need the signal ψ. Thus, the circuit structures of the circuit blocks have become complicated. Referring to Fig. 2, the integrated circuit comprising transfer gates is described. Inputs T One example of operation of the circuit shown in Fig. 2 is explained with reference to Fig. 3. In the followings, by way of example, the explanation is made on the circuit blocks 11 and 1 As described above, the signal ψ is transmitted only to the circuit block or blocks which necessitate to take the signal ψ therein, and hence the load capacitance associated to the terminal for receiving the signal ψ is remarkably reduced. Referring to Figs. 4 and 5, a detailed embodiment of the present invention is described. This embodiment is the case where the principle according to Fig. 2 is applied to the multi strobe type dynamic RAM. Fig. 4. shows a block diagram of the multi strobe type RAM to which the present invention is applied. A memory cell array 43 includes a plurality of dynamic type memory cells MC each coupled to one of word lines WL and one of bit lines BL and sense amplifiers not shown . A row address signal latch circuit 41 is connected to a set of address input terminals A₁ to A One example of the detection circuit 44 is shown in Fig. 6. In Fig. 6 one bit structure of the column latch circuit 44 is shown. An address terminal A Fig. 5 shows waveforms showing operations of the memory of Fig. 4. At time point t₁, Then, operation is changed to the self refreshing operation. Namely, As has been described above, by way of examples the present invention is advantageous in reduction of the load capacitance associated to a common external terminal.
