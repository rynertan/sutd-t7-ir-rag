# Bearing.

## Abstract
A bearing, particularly a heavy duty bearing, in which lubrication is effected by lubricant being picked up on a disc 27, 28 mounted on the bearing shaft 21 , the disc having, at its periphery, an axially extending ring 35 on the inner and outer surface of which the lubricant forms a film. During start up, lubricant on the outer surface scraped off by an external scraper 57 and falls under gravity onto the bear ing surface and as the speed increases, lubricant on the inner surface is picked up by a scoop to produce a pressure head sufficient to pump the lubricant to a reservoir from which it flows to the bearing surface under gravity. The lubricant is pumped to the reservoir through an external cooler and an external filter.
