# Method and apparatus for continuous longitudinal scroll slitting and cutting of wide coiled material webs into narrow webs, sheets, strips and blanks.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for longitudinally slitting wide coiled materials to provide one or more blank rows. The coil of material is first uncoiled and presented to a slitting device where it is longitudinally slit along nonstraight scroll lines extending generally parallel to the longitudinal edges of the web. The scroll lines extend tangentially to a generating circle G encircling and concentric to a circle defining a blank D to thereby form at least one elongated strip having undulating lateral edges. The strip is then cropped along the lateral edges to remove from the concave portions thereof a polygon shaped form 6 so that a polygonal shaped blank 5 is formed concentrically encircling the circular blank D . A plurality of the polygonal shaped blanks 5 are attached to one another in the strip across a side of the polygonal shape at generally the midlength thereof.
