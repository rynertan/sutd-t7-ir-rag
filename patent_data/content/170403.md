# Anti friction and non oscillating spool for belt driven cartridge.

## Abstract
A tape spool 16, 18 including two flanges 52, 54 interconnected by a hub 56 providing a cylindrical tape winding surface 58 is adapted for mounting on and rotation around a cylindrical pin 60 extending from one of two spaced, parallel walls 12, 14 of a data cartridge 10 by providing a bore 64 extending through the hub 56 and one of the flanges 54 which closely but freely fits said pin 60 , and a bearing protrusion 66 extending from the other of the flanges 52 into the bore 64 wherein the extension of the pin 60 from its cartridge wall 12 is greater than the length of the bore 64 to the bearing protrusion 66 so that the spool 16, 18 is suspended above the wall 12 for free rotation about the pin 60 . Oscillation of the spool 16, 18 on the pin 60 may be prevented by also providing a wear button protrusion 72 extending from the other of the flanges 52 opposite and coaxial with the bore 64 and a spring 74 which extends from the remaining cartridge wall 14 to contact the wear button protrusion 72 and force the spool 16, 18 into contact with the pin 60 .
