# IMPROVED OPTICAL FIBRE CABLE

## Abstract
Optical fibre cables are produced containing an extruded support member of thermotropic liquid crystalline polymer in which the extrusion conditions are used to control the thermal expansion coefficient of the support member. The support member may be extruded on to the support member. In this case extrusion conditions may be used to induce a compres sive strain on the fibre which can counteract the thermal change in length of the fibre when subject to temperature variations so that a cable having an optical path length which is less sensitive to temperature variation can be produced. Support members which provide a loose fitting sleeve over the fibre can be produced by control of extrusion conditions to have a thermal expansion coefficient of not less than 5 10 ‚Å∂ K.
