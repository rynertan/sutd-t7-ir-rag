# POLYURETHANES BASED ON POLYETHER BLENDS

## Abstract
Polyurethane compositions based on aliphatic diiso cyanates, or prepolymers of aliphatic diisocyanates, and blends of ethylene oxide capped polypropylene glycol poly ethers of at least tri functionality with ethylene oxide capped polypropylene glycol polyethers of di functionality are dis closed. Suitable aliphatic diisocyanates comprise tertiary aralkyl isocyanates with a preferred isocyanate being para tetramethylxylylene diisocyanate p TMXDI . The composi tions disclosed include reaction injection molding composi tions.
