# Polymer modified polyols, a method of forming them, their use in the manufacture of polyurethane products and the products so obtained.

## Abstract
A polymer modified polyol comprises a dispersion in a first polyol which has a molecular weight of at least 1000, an av erage functionality of more than 2, and a Hydroxyl Number of less than 150, of the reaction product of a polyisocyanate and a second polyol which is either a a polyethylene glycol having a molecular weight of up to 600 or b a polyol, which is not a poly ethylene glycol, and which has a molecular weight of less than 250 and is free from nitrogen atoms. A method of forming the polymer modified polyol, its use in the manufacture of polyurethane products and the polyure thane products so obtained, are included. The dispersions are particularly useful for preparing high ly resilient flexible foams.
