# Method of manufacturing a solid waste derived fuel.

## Abstract
A solid pulverisable fuel of consistent calorific value is made by mixing a solid waste of appreciable calorific value with an alumino silicate, hydraulic cement and water. The alumino silicate may be fly ash or colliery waste.

## Claims
CLAIPZS 1. A method of manufacturing a solid storable pulverisable fuel with a reasonably consistent calorific value such method being characterised by the steps of mixing a solid waste of appreciable calorific value, in the presence of water, with a finely divided aluminium silicate based substance such as fly ash to provide a substantially homogenous mixture and incorporating a hydraulic cement in the mixture. 2. A method as claimed in Claim 1 wherein the alumino silicate based material is a colliery waste sufficiently wet to provide the water.

## Description
DESCRIPTION This invention relates to a fuel derived from wastes having an appreciable calorific value but not in themselves suitable for use as fuul. Our co pending Patent Application No. 79 301826.8 des cribs a method of dealing with thick mobile wastes such methed being characterised by the stet of mixing the waste in the presence of water with a finely divided aluminium silicate based substance such as fly ash to provide a substantially homogenous mixture and incorporating a hydraulic cement in the mixture. We have now found that solid wastes of appreciable calorific value can be treated in a similar manner by mixing them in the crese.ce of water with a finely divided aluminium silicate based substance such as fly ash to provide a substantially homogenous mixture or slurry and incorporating a hydraulic cement in the mixture. The solid waste of appreciable calorific value nay be derived from coal mining operations or may for example be spent filter cake. As in the disclosure of the copending patent application mentioned previously fly ash may be replaced by colliery waste, that is the substance derived from the water used for the washing of coal. If the waste is wet it can introduce sufficient water into the system as well as providing the alumino slicate for the setting. The invention will be described in the following two exartles EXAMPLE I Fuel based on a solid Coal Tar Pitch Residue 200g of a powdered pitch residue Calorific Value CV 16,980 BTU 1b was slurried in 240g of a waste soluble oil CV 2,830 BTU 1b containing approximately 83 water. 300g of solid colliery waste CCV 5,000 3TU lb , 170g of fly ash and 90g portland cement were added to produce a paste, which set in five days to a hard solid mass which was readily pulverised. The Calorific Value of the produce was found to be 5,570 BTU 1b.EXAMPLE 2 Fuel based on a solid Oil Loaded Fullers earth Ex. Lubricating Oil Re Refining by Acid Clay Process. 350g of a soft, cohesive Fullers parch solid filter cake impregnated with oil CV 8,100BTR 1b was added to 430g of an oil iron oxide scale slurry CV 9,090 BTR 1b . The blending was completed by mixing 150g of pond scurry CV 5,000BTR 1b the low value by product of coal washing and 70g of cement. Pond slurry is a damp colliery waste which brings sufficient water into the system as well as providing the aluminium silicate. After one week the product had set to a dry powder similar in appearance to the original millers Earth but was much drier and less cohesive, making handling easier. The CV of the final material was 7,494 BTU 1b.
