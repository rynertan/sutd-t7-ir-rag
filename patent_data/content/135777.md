# ROBOT JOINT

## Abstract
A robot joint including a housing, dual input means on opposite sides of the housing, an eccentric driven by each input means and adapted to both walk around an inner surface of the housing and to drive a first pair of bevel gears, a second pair of bevel gears, each of which meshes with both of the first pair of bevel gears, and a single cylindrical output member secured to one of the second pair of bevel gears. If the dual input means and, hence, the first pair of bevel gears are driven in the same direction at the same speed, the cylindrical output member is caused to be raised or lowered, whereas if driven at the same speed in opposite directions, the output member is caused to rotate in a clock wise or counterclockwise direction. Variations in speed and direction will result in desired combinations of pitch and roll movements.
