# COMPOSITE ARTICLES AND A METHOD FOR THEIR MANUFACTURE

## Abstract
A method of making a lightweight component in which a core made from a ceramic or ceramic metal mixture is surrounded with metal and the whole component subjected to a hot isostatic pressing process. Examples of articles given are balls for ball bearings, aerofoil shaped blades or vanes, and poppet valves. The core is generally pre formed, and the metal may be in pre pressed powder sheet metal form. In a method of making a ball bearing an Alumina sphere 1 is surrounded by pre pressed Iron alloy powder in the form of hemispherical shells 2, placed in a glass, ceramic or metal can 3, which is evacuated and sealed, and subjected to hot isostatic pressure in a vessel 6 to form the composite ball. Alternative methods of manufacture are also described.
