# Production of ion exchange membrane.

## Abstract
A method of producing an ion exchange membrane suitable for use in an electrolytic cell in which the membrane is expanded by stretching at elevated temperature to increase the surface area per unit weight of the membrane. The membrane may be annealed at elevated temperature, and may be cooled whilst restrained in the expanded state. The membrane when used in an electrolytic cell remains taut and unwrinkled and leads to reduced voltage operation of the cell.
