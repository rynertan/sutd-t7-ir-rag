# Alkali earth metal oxide based coating compositions.

## Abstract
A noncarbonated complex for use in preparing coating compositions is comprised of the reaction product of a basic oxide selected from the group consisting of calcium and magnesium oxide and mixtures thereof an organic sulfonic acid having an equivalent weight of about 300 to 750 grams per equivalent and water. The molar ratio of basic oxide to organic sulfonic acid is at least 10 1. The molar ratio of water to basic oxide is less than 2.5 1 and greater than 0.5 1 when the basic oxide is at least 30 percent calcium oxide. The molar ratio of water to basic oxide is less than 0.7 1 and greater than 0.3 1 when the basic oxide is less than 30 percent calcium oxide.
