# Roll transfer mechanism for web material dispenser.

## Abstract
A dispenser 10 for multiple rolls of web material such as paper toweling that is provided with dispensing mechan ism 22 to lead a web of material out of the dispenser 10 to the user has supports 36,38 for rotatably supporting rolls in primary and reserve positions, respectively, with transfer mechanism interactive with such roll supports 36,38 and the dispensing mechanism 22 to automatically transfer web feed from one roll to the other under predetermined sensed conditions. The transfer mechanism includes a pivotally mounted transfer frame 50 swingable to be out of the way to facilitate dispenser loading with the dispenser cabinet cover 14 open, the transfer frame 50 being releasibly retained out of the way in conjunction with dispenser loading, and movable to a sensing location upon closure of the cabinet cover 14 whereat depletion of web material supplied from the roll in the primary position P is sensed whereafter the frame again shifts for tucking fingers 70 on the transfer frame 50 to press a web end portion of the reverse roll R web material into the dispensing mechanism 22 to thereafter feed web material from such reserve roll R . A keeper bracket 72 loosely receives this web end portion incident dispenser loading with the action of cabinet cover 14 closing causing the bracket 72 to firmly grip such portion until the transfer mechanism coacts with the dis pensing mechanism 22 to thereafter feed web material supplied from the reserve roll R .
