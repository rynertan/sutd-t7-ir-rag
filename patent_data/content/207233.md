# Straining and stop valve.

## Abstract
A fluid filtering stop valve 10 having a body 12 with a cylindrical chamber 18 having a circumferential sidewall 28 with inlet, outlet and flush ports, 22,24,26 and a cylindrical plug member 20 rotatably disposed in the chamber 18 . The plug member 20 has spaced apart first and second circular plates 42,44 with an off center filtering screen 58 extending therebetween. The plug member 20 is rotatably between a filtering position in which the screen 58 is located in the fluid flow between the inlet and outlet ports 22,24 , a backflushing position in which the screen is located in the fluid flow be tween the inlet and flush ports 22,26 , with the filtering side 64 of the screen 58 toward the flush ports 26 , and a closed position in which an arcuate plate washer loosely retained between the first and second plates 42,44 is positioned to seal the flush and outlet ports 26,24 . In the filtering position the washer 74 seals only the flush port 26 and in the flush position the washer 74 seals only the outlet port 24 . The screen uses outwardly diverging ribs 66 to reduce lodging of material between the ribs 66 . A second screen 80 filters the fluid from the inlet port 22 during backflushing.
