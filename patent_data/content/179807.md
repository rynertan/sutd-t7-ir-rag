## Description
The β adrenergic receptor blocking agents comprise an important 11a hello group of approved therapeutic agents. They have the common pharmacological property of blocking the action of agonists of β adrenergic receptor sites in that they compete with the agonists for receptor sites. Various physiological responses, characteristic of the tissue which is involved, occur as a result of blocking of the receptor site. Beta adrenergic blocking agents have a variety of pharmacokinetic properties, some of which may influence side effects. Commonly, these agents are administered to patients suffering from ischemic heart disease or myocardial infarction for the purpose of reducing the work conducted by the heart, namely heart rate and contractile force. Reducing heart work reduces oxygen demand and may in fact, increase oxygen supply. Reducing the work required of the heart can thereby minimize or prevent further tissue damage and can relieve the pain of angina pectoris. The use of β adrenergic receptor blocking agents to decrease myocardial oxygen requirements and control dysrhythmia after acute myocardial infarction has, however, been somewhat limited in view of the potential for producing long lasting cardiac depression. It has therefore been suggested Erhardt, et al, J Med Chem, 1982, Vol. 25, pp 1402 1407 that β adrenergic blocking agents having an ultrashort duration of action could minimize or eliminate this limitation. Such agents could be administered by intravenous infusion to rapidly obtain desired levels of β adrenergic blockade allow rapid adjustment of blockade as might be required and reduce the risk of resultant long lasting cardiac depression since the effects of the agent would rapidly dissipate upon the termination of the infusion. As described in the Erhardt, et al publication, supra as well as publications by Zaroslinski, et al, Life Sciences, Vol. 31, pp 899 907, 1982 and Erhardt, et al, J Med Chem, Vol 25, 1982, pp 1408 1412, certain compounds containing ester functions have been found to possess β adrenergic blocking action of relatively short duration of action The present invention is directed to stable pharmaceutical compositions for parenteral administration of compositions useful in the treatment of patients having a cardiac condition such as hypertension or angina pectoris and for the treatment of arrhythmias and myocardial infarction.

In preferred compositions, the β blocking agent incorporated in the pharmaceutical composition is selected from one of the following compounds. These compounds are active β blocking agents as illustrated by the following data of duration and potency. The duration of β blockade was determined The compositions of the present invention consist of a hydroalcoholic solution containing an above described β blocking compound or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt at a concentration of from 0.01 to 30 by weight. Concentrations of less than approximately 0.01 weight of the β blocking compounds in solutions generally do not provide effective β blocking activity at practical infusion rates, while there is generally no added benefit to having concentrations greater than about 30 weight of the β blocker in solution. In particularly preferred compositions, the concentration of β blocking compound in solution is from 0.01 to 10 by weight. The hydroalcoholic solution preferably contains from about 5 to about 50 by volume ethanol. Ethanol has been found to be important in the stabilization of the β blocking compound according to the present invention. The hydroalcoholic solutions also preferably contain from about 5 to about 50 by volume of physiologically acceptable liquid polyhydric compound. Physiologically acceptable liquid polyhydric compounds include, but are not limited to, alkyls of from 1 to 10 carbon atoms having two or more adjacent hydroxyl groups such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol or glycerol polyethylene glycols having a molecular weight of from 200 to 600 daltons and glycerine. Preferred liquid polyhydric compounds include alkyls of from 1 to about 10 carbon atoms having two or more adjacent hydroxyl groups, and polyethylene glycols having a molecular weight of from 200 to 600 daltons. Glycerin is less preferred, because solutions containing it have been observed to discolor on storage at 55 C. A particularly preferred liquid polyhydric compound is propylene glycol. Liquid polyhydric compounds, in conjunction with ethanol are useful stabilizing components of the β blocking compounds in the hydroalcoholic solution according to the present invention. In particularly preferred compositions, the volume ratio of ethanol to the liquid polyhydric compound is approximately 1 1. Stability of the β blocking compound in solution is affected by the pH of the solution. In preferred compositions, the pH of the hydroalcoholic solution ranges from 2.0 to 4.0. When the pH of the solution is less than 2.0 or greater than 4.0, degradation of the β blocking compound was observed. In particularly preferred compositions, the pH ranges from about 2.8 to 3.2, and in the most preferred compositions, the pH ranges from 2.8 to 3.0. The pH is preferably maintained by a physiologically acceptable buffering agent at a concentration of from 0.05 to 2 molar. Preferred buffering agents include tartrate buffers, acetate buffers, trishydroxymethylaminomethane, and the like and amphoteric compounds such as glycine or cystine. Tartrate buffers are particularly preferred. The molar ratio of the β blocking compound to buffering agent advantageously is 1 1 to 3 1. The β blocking compounds used in the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are made quite stable by the hydroalcoholic solution of the present invention. Typical compositions exhibit shelf lives from 12 months to 24 months, compared to approximately 7 days for the same compounds in conventional aqueous preparations. These compositions thus facilitate commercial distribution and storage of the above described short acting ester containing β blockers. The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are preferably added to a physiologically acceptable infusion medium to a final concentration of β adrenergic compound as deemed necessary by the patient s condition and needs, and thereby parenterally administered to the patient. The dosages and rates of administration of these compositions generally depend upon the patient s needs and the particular β blocking compound employed. These dosages and rates of administration are described in U.S. Patent, i.e. US A 4,387,103 issued June 7, 1983. In order to illustrate the manner in which the above compositions may be prepared and the properties of the compositions, reference is made to the following examples, which, however, are not meant to limit or restrict the scope of the invention in any respect. For convenience, the invention will be exemplified with respect to the sulfate salt of the compound of formula II. A stability indicating high pressure liquid chromatographic HPLC assay was developed for the compound of formula II which was suitable to monitor the compound and its degradation product s during the early phase of formulation studies. The method of HPLC analysis is described hereafter. Formulation screening was conducted to determine the parameters essential for an acceptable product. Based on these data, the composition of the formulations containing both active and inactive ingredients were ascertained. Representative formulations were packaged in ampuls and placed on accelerated and room temperature stability test. At various time intervals, samples from stability stations were removed and assayed for potency of the compound. Based on the stability data, the formula composition is stable. Initially, the solubility of the compound was determined in various vehicles. The amount dissolved was measured by HPLC Table 2 . The pKa is 8.17 and the aqueous solution is acidic 1 is approximately pH 1 . Based on this acidic nature, a tartrate buffer was selected. It was found that the molar ratio of active β blocking agent to buffer was critical, 1 1 to 3 1 to stabilized product. In order to determine the pH at which the formulation would show maximum stability, a kinetic degradation study was employed. pH of solutions ranging from 2 4, containing 0.1 M each of the compound of formula II and tartrate buffer were stored at 75 C. At various time intervals, samples were taken and assayed for the compound. The kinetic data obtained was plotted as a log of drug concentration versus time. The apparent first order rate constants were calculated from the slopes of the linear regression lines fitted to log C log Co 2.303 kt where C is drug concentration at time t, Co is the initial drug concentration and k is the apparent first order rate constant. The kinetics of degradation of the drug at 75 C and at various pH values was followed by monitoring the potency of the drug at different stability times. The logarithm of the potency versus time in all cases produced linear plots. The apparent first order rate constants were calculated from the slopes of the linear regression lines not shown and are presented in Fig. 1. The results showed a pseudo first order degradation kinetic pattern. The pH of the stable region was determined, and considering physiological pH, a pH range of 2.8 to 3.4 was selected for formulation purpose. The ratio of the two organic vehicles, namely propylene glycol and alcohol were determined by making solutions of the compound of formula II in the vehicle and testing the stability at 75 C. Samples were removed after specified times and measured for potency. The rate of degradation at various ratios of propylene glycol and alcohol were determined and plotted as shown in Figure 2. Results point out a 1 1 ratio of the two substances minimizes degradation while at the same time not providing too high a concentration of either of them. Figure 3 illustrates the stability of the compound of formula II in hydroalcoholic solution buffered at pH 3 by sodium tartrate. An identical stability study was conducted with a solution without buffering agent Figure 4 . Because the kinetic pattern follows pseudo first order, the potency at 75 C upon storage was converted to natural logarithm prior to plotting. Results clearly show that the buffered preparation is approximately twice as stable as the unbuffered product. The rate of degradation as measured by the slope is 3.87 x 10 ² day ¹ buffered while it is 7.09 x 10 ² day ¹ unbuffered . The sulfate salt of the compound of Formula II in aqueous solution when stored at 75 C degraded about 70 in one week. In contrast, when formulated in the pharmaceutical composition as noted and placed under the same storage conditions, it degraded only about 25 . Thus, a significant three fold increase in stability resulted when the proper composition was used to formulate the product. The results of this comparison are represented in Figure 5. Samples for the study were prepared and tested as follows On the basis of these results, a preferred composition of formulation was selected as shown in Example 1. The formulations were packaged and placed on long term stability. Test results are shown in Example 2. Although there were some potency losses at elevated temperatures, there were no significant losses either at room temperature, high intensity light or refrigeration. Ordinarily, with compositions of the invention, it is preferred to experience less than a 10 potency loss at 40 C over a three month period or over a twelve to twenty four month period at room temperature. Based on the kinetic pattern at about 40 C, it is believed that a 10 potency loss at a three month period extrapolates to a 10 potency loss at 24 months at room temperature. Without stabilization as described herein, the compound of formula II loses 10 potency within a week when stored at room temperature. Samples were dissolved or diluted with the mobile phase, methanol pH 3.4 phosphate buffer solution. The resulting solutions were diluted with benzoic acid internal standard solution and chromatographed on a octadecyl silane column with detection at 229 nm. The selectivity of the chromatographic system for intact compound was demonstrated by resolving the parent drug from synthetic intermediates, potential impurities and reaction products resulting from accelerated degradation conditions. The method is linear, quantitative, rugged and reproducible with a sensitivity of 2 ug ml. Either peak height or peak area ratios can be used for quantitation. The formulation is a clear, colorless, sterile, nonpyrogenic solution of the active β blocking agent in Propylene Glycol, Alcohol, USP and Water for Injection, 15 15 70 at a concentration of 50 mg ml. The ampuls and glassware for compounding, filtering and filling were washed and depyrogenated. The filter assembly, filling tube assembly and other parts and equipment were sterilized. A 10 N NaOH solution was prepared. The sulfate salt of the compound of formula II and tartaric acid were weighed out and placed in a glass vessel. Water for injection WFI was added to dissolve the materials. The pH was adjusted to 2.9 in the aqueous phase with 10 N NaOH and propylene glycol was added. The ethanol was then added and the mixture was stirred to dissolve the solid materials. Water for injection was added to the final volume and the solution was filtered through a 0.2 µm membrane. The solution was then placed in ampuls which were sealed, leak tested and inspected. Ampuls prepared according to the procedure of Example 1 were selected and placed on stability test. At each stability time one ampul of each solution was removed. The pH, potency and the physical appearance of the solutions was determined. The concentration of the drug was determined by a high performance liquid chromatographic HPLC method. The results are tabulated in Tables 3 and 4 for 5 and 10 ml ampuls. The glossary for the abbreviations used in the tables is as follows
