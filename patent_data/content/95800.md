# Optical disc apparatus.

## Abstract
The invention relates to optical disk apparatus for play ing back and or recording information on rotary optical discs 7 , which apparatus comprises a clamping device which clamps an optical disc on a spindle 14 . The clamp ing device comprises a disc loader 21 which moves with clearance in a support 2 which moves between the rest po sition and an operating position, which disc loader clamps the disc magnetically onto the spindle by means of perma nent magnetic means. To prevent the disc loader rattling or taking up an oblique position in the support when the sup port is not in its operating position, the permanent magnetic means comprise means 35A, B which exert a magnetic force which acts between the support and the disc loader so that the disc loader is clamped against the support when the latter is not in the operating position.
