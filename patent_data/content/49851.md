## Description
Endoscope This invention relates to an endoscope with an instrument raising unit. In general, endoscopes are provided with an insertion channel in which a medical instrument such as a forceps is inserted and guided, and a raising block for restricting the direction in which the instrument is led is disposed at the distal opening portion of the insertion channel. The raising block can be remotely rocked by a proximal control section through means of a control wire passed through the endoscope. Since the distal end portion of the instrument, which is urged curvedly to project, abuts strongly on the raising block, there is caused a great resistance, making smooth operation difficult. In order to eliminate such difficulty, there has conventionally been proposed a system in which a pair of operating pins are attached to a rocking body Japanese Patent Publication No. 17679 77 . In this system, however, a medical instrument to be bent is caused to abut on the pair of operating pins which are rocking together with the rocking body, so that the distance between the points of contact between the instrument and the operating pins is fixed.Therefore, the force to rock the rocking body is too great to ensure smooth operation. In the aforesaid conventional system, moreover, both of the operating pins strongly press on the instrument as they slide on the instrument, and the contact points of these pins on the instrument move along the longitudinal direction of the instrument.Accordingly, the length of projection of the instrument in the body cavity greatly changes during the raising operation to constitute a hindrance to the operation.In consideration of the narrowness of the body cavity, moreover, such change is quite hazardous. The object of this invention is to provide an endoscope capable of safe and smooth raising of a medical instrument without involving any great change in the length of projection of the instrument from the endoscope. This invention can be more fully understood from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Figs. 1 to 6 show an endoscope according to an embodiment of this invention, in which Fig. 1 is an overall schematic perspective view, Fig. 2 is a plan view of a distal rigid portion, Figs. 3 and 4 are sectional views of the rigid portion shifted at an angle of 900, and Figs. 5 and 6 are side views of a rocking body in different rotating positions showing the raised state of a medical instrument. Now there will be described an embodiment of this invention with reference to the accompanying drawings. In Fig. 1, numeral 1 designates an endoscope body which includes a flexible insertion section 2 and a control section 3 connected with the proximal end of the insertion section 2. A light guide cable 4 is coupled to the control section 3. The insertion section 2 is formed of a flexible tube 5 and a distal rigid portion 7 coupled to the distal end of the flexible tube 5 by means of a bendable tube 6 connected therebetween. The bendable tube 6 can be remotely curved by means of a pair of angle knobs 8 at the control section 3. As shown in Fig. 2, moreover, an illumination window 9 and an observation window 10 are arranged on the top side of the distal rigid portion 7 along the longitudinal direction of the insertion section 2. Further, an opening portion lla of an instrument raising chamber 11 is formed in parallel with the windows 9 and 10.The illumination window 9 is connected with a light guide not shown which is passed through the insertion section 2, the control section 3, and the light guide cable 4, while the observation window 10 is connected with an eyepiece section 12 at the control section 3 by means of an image guide not shown which is passed through the insertion section 2 and the control section 3. Formed at the insertion section 2 and the control section 3 of the endoscope body 1, as shown in Figs. 3 and 4, is a channel 14 for instrument insertion whose distal end opens into the raising chamber 11 and whose proximal end is connected with an insertion port 13 at the control section 3. The channel 14 is formed of the bore of a flexible tube 15. Disposed in the instrument raising chamber 11 is a discoid rocking body or rotating disc 18 with a rotating center shaft 17 extending in a direction at right angles to the direction in which a medical instrument 16 such as a forceps is inserted. Each end of the rotating shaft 17 is rockably supported on its corresponding side wall of the rigid portion 7. As shown in Fig. 4, the rocking body 18 is located in a position kept aside from the passage of the instrument 16, and an operating member or pin 19 protrudes from one side of the rocking body 18 near the periphery thereof toward the passage of the instrument 16. The tip end of a control wire 20 is fixed on the other side of the rocking body 18 near the upper peripheral portion thereof.The other end of the control wire 20 is led to the control section 3 through a flexible guide tube 21 which is passed through the insertion section 2 and the control section 3, and is coupled to a raising knob 22 rockably supported by the control section 3. By rocking the knob 22 in one direction, the control wire 20 can be pulled so that the rocking body 18 may be rocked in the clockwise direction of Fig. 3. Inside the instrument raising chamber 11, a fixed member or pin 23 protrudes toward the passage of the instrument 16 from the wall portion of the chamber 11 lying across the passage of the instrument 16 from the aforesaid one side of the rocking body 18. Projecting at right angles to the direction of insertion of the instrument 16, the fixed pin 23 is deviated downwardly from the rotating shaft 17 of the rocking body 18.As shown in Fig. 3, the fixed pin 23 is nearer to the rotating shaft 17 than the operating pin 19 is. Further, both the operating pin 19 and the fixed pin 23 project into the passage of the instrument 16 inside the instrument raising chamber 11 so that their respective peripheral side faces may abut on the instrument 16. In a normal stand by state, the operating pin 19 and the fixed pin 23 are located in the positions shown in Fig. 3, that is, the operating pin 19 is located in a lower position so that these two pins 19 and 23 and the rotating shaft 17 are substantially in a straight line, allowing the instrument 16 projecting from the channel 14 to advance between the pins 19 and 23. Now there will be described the raising operation in the aforementioned endoscope. In the normal state, the control wire 20 is advanced, and the rocking body 18 is in the position shown in Fig. 3. When the instrument 16 is inserted, the tip end portion of the instrument 16 passes between the operating pin 19 and the fixed pin 23 to project out of the rigid portion through the opening portion of the instrument raising chamber 11. At this time, the instrument 16 makes a substantially straight advance as indicated by a chain line. Then, in raising the instrument 16, the knob 22 at the control section 3 is rocked in one direction to pull the control wire 20, thereby rocking the rocking body 18 clockwise, as shown in Fig. 5. Accompanying the rocking motion of the rocking body 18, the operating pin 19 point of action raises the forward end side of the instrument 16 while the fixed pin 23 fulcrum sustains the rear end side portion of the instrument 16, so that the forward end side of the instrument 16 can rise. While the instrument 16 is supported at a fixed point by the fixed pin 23, the point of the instrument 16 abutting on the operating pin 19 moves forward or away from the fixed point as the rocking body 18 rocks. As shown in Figs. 3, 5 and 6, therefore, the distance between the operating pin 19 and the fixed pin 23 continuously increases with the rocking motion of the rocking body 18. In other words, the distance between the fulcrum and the point of action increases with the rise. Thus, the raising operation requires only small force. Since the point fulcrum in contact with the fixed pin 23 is fixed, moreover, the raising operation is stable. Although a disc is used for the rocking body in the above embodiment, this invention is not limited to such configuration. Further, the pins used as the operating and fixed members may be replaced with members in any other styles, provided that they project toward the instrument so as to be able to abut on the instrument being raised. For example, a cam projection formed integrally with the rocking body may be used for the operating member. The means for rocking the rocking body is not limited to the wire, and may be any suitable means which can rock the rocking body in any direction. According to this invention, as described above, the distance between the point of action provided by the operating member and the fulcrum provided by the fixed member increases with the rise of the instrument, so that the instrument can be raised with a small operating force, ensuring smooth and easy operation. Moreover, the use of the fixed member as the fulcrum enables smooth and stable raising of the instrument, and prohibits the length of projection of the instrument from changing. Thus, the raising operation in the narrow body cavity can safely be performed without hindrance.
