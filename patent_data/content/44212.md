The presence of undesired vegetation causes substantial damage to useful crops, especially agricultural products that satisfy man s basic food needs, such as soybeans, corn, wheat and the like. The current population explosion and concomitant world food shortage demand improvements in the efficiency of producing.these crops. Preventing or minimizing theloss of a portion of valuable crops by killing, or inhibiting the growth of undesired vegetation is one way of improving this efficiency. A wide variety of materials useful for killing, or inhibiting controlling the growth of undesired vegetation is available such materials are commonly referred to as herbicides. However, the need exists for still more effective herbicides that destroy or retard weeds without causing significant damage to useful crops. We have now discovered novel compounds which may be used as general, as well as selective, preand post emergence herbicides.

The reaction is best carried out in inert solvents such as methylene chloride and acetonitrile.The mode of addition is not critical, however, it is often convenient to add a solution of the isocyanate or isothiocyanate of Formula II to a stirred suspension of the aminoheterocycle III , V , XI or XItI The reaction is generally exothermic. In some cases, the desired product is insoluble in the reaction medium and crystallizes from it in pure form.Products soluble in the reaction medium are isolated by evaporation of the solvent and trituration of the residue with solvents such as diethyl ether, l chlorobutane, or hexanes and filtration. EMI12.1 EMI13.1 Compounds of this invention may also be prepared by reacting a sulfonamide of Formula VIII with a 4,6dichloroheterocyclic isocyanate of Formula IX.EMI14.1 One or both of the halogen atoms on the heterocyclic ring of the compound of Formula VII can be displaced by an alkoxide of OR8, to give compounds ofFormula X, where R8 is C1 C4 alkyl, C3 C4 alkyl, C3 C4 alkynyl, CH2CH2OCH3 or C2 C4 alkyl substituted with 1 3 atoms of F, C1 or Br, and Y is C1 or OCH3.EMI14.2 The process for the preparation of compounds ofFormula X is described in our European Patent SpecificationNo. 0030140, published 10 June 1981. Sulfonamides, prepared as described in ResearchDisclosure, pg. 52, 1978 , may conveniently be converted to the corresponding isocyanates or isothiocyanates of Formula II by methods described in U.S.Patent No. 4,127,405. The synthesis of the heterocyclicamine derivatives has been reviewed in The Chemistry of Heterocyclic Compounds , a series published in IntersciencePubl., New York and London. 2 Aminopyrimidines are described by D. J. Brown in The Pyrimidines , Vol. XVI of the above series which are herein incorporated by reference. The preparation of amino bicyclopyrimidines are described in unexamined European Patent No. 15683. The aminoheterocyclic intermediates of FormulaIII, V, XI or XIII in which R4 is CH3, may be prepared by the following procedure, or by obvious modifications thereof.EMI15.1 A solution of the amine XV in concentrated hydrochloric acid is contacted with an aqueous sodium nitrite solution and the chloro compound XVI is isolated by filtration of the acidic solution see for example, Bee and Rose, J. Chem. Soc. C., 2051 1966 for the case in which Z is CH and X and Y areOCH3 . Displacement of the chlorine may be accomplished by heating with an excess of methylamine in water to obtain the methylaminoheterocycle XVII. N Methoxyamino heterocycles can be prepared by procedures reported on the literature see, for example, Belgian Patent 618,563 and J. T. Shaw, et al.,J. Orq. Chem., 27 4054 1962 and the procedure illustrated below.EMI16.1 Chloro compound XVI is reacted with hydroxylamine to form derivative XVIII which may be alkylated with methyl bromide to afford the N methoxy heterocyclic amine XIX. This compound may alternately be prepared in one step by treatment of XVI and O methyl hydroxylamine hydrochloride with an alkali metal hydroxide such as sodium hydroxide.

Thus, in another aspect, the invention provides a composition suitable for controlling the growth of undesired vegetation which comprises at least one compound of formula I according to the invention in association with at least one of the following surfactant, solid diluent and liquid diluent. Formulations Useful formulations of the compounds of FormulaI can be prepared in conventional ways. They include dusts, granules, pellets, solutions, suspensions, emulsions, wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates and the like. Many of these may be applied directly.Sprayable formulations can be extended in suitable media and used at spray volumes of from a few liters to several hundred liters per hectare. High strength compositions are primarily used as intermediates for further formulation. The formulations, broadly, contain about 0.1 to 998 by weight of active ingredient s and at least one of a about 0.1 to 20 surfactant s and b about 1 to 99.9 solid or liquid diluent s .More specifically, they will contain these ingredients in the following approximate proportins Table V Weight Percent Active Ingredient Diluent s Surfactant s Wettable Powders 20 90 0 74 1 10Oil Suspensions, 3 50 40 95 0 15Emulsions, Solutions, including EmulsifiableConcentrates Aqueous Suspension 10 50 40 84 1 20Dusts 1 25 70 99 0 5Granules and Pellets 0.1 95 5 99.9 0 15High Strength 90 99 0 10 0 2Compositions Active ingredient plus at least one of a Surfactant or a Diluent equals 100 weight percent. Lower or higher levels of active ingredient can, of course, be present depending on the intended use and the physical properties of the compound. Higher ratios of surfactant to active ingredient are sometimes desirable, and are achieved by incorporation into the formulation or by tank mixing. Typical solid diluents are described in Watkins, et al., Handbook of Insecticide Dust Diluents andCarriers , 2nd Ed., Dorland Books, Caldwell, NewJersey, but other solids, either mined or manufactured, may be used. The more absorptive diluents are preferred for wettable powders and the denser ones for dusts. Typical liquid diluents and solvents are described in Marsden, Solvents Guide, 2nd Ed., Interscience, New York, 1950.Solubility under 0.1 is preferred for suspension concentrates solution concentrates are preferably stable against phase separation at 0 C. McCutcheon s Detergents and Emulsifiers Annual , MC Publishing Corp., Ridgewood, New Jersey, as well as Sisely and Wood, Encyclopedia of SurfaceActive Agents, Chemical Publishing Co., Inc., NewYork, 1964, list surfactants and recommended uses.All formulations can contain minor amounts of additives to reduce foaming, caking, corrosion, microbiological growth, etc. The methods of making such compositions are well known. Solutions are prepared by simply mixing the ingredients. Fine solid compositions are made by blending and, usually, grinding as in q hammer or fluid energy mill. Suspensions are prepared by wet milling see, for example, Littler, U.S. Patent 3,060,084 . Granules and pellets may be made by spraying the active material upon preformed granular carriers or by agglomeration techniques. See J. E.Browning, Agglomeration , Chemical Engineering,December 4, 1967, pp. 147ff. and Perry s ChemicalEngineer s Handbook , 5th Ed., McGraw Hill, New York, 1973, pp. 8 57ff.

They have utility for broad spectrum pre and or post emergence weed control in areas where complete control of all vegetation is desired, such as around fuel storage tanks, ammunition depots, industrial storage areas, oil well sites, drive in theaters, around billboards, highway and railroad structures. By properly selecting rate, time and method of application, compounds of this invention may also be used to modify plant growth beneficially, and also to selectively control weeds in crops such as wheat, barley, rice, corn and soybeans. The precise amount of the compounds of Formula I to be used in any given situation will vary according to the par ticular end result desired, the amount of foliage present, the weeds to be controlled, the crop species involved, the soil type, the formulation and mode of application, weather conditions, etc. Since so many variables play a role, it is not possible to state a rate of application suitable for alL situations. Broadly speaking, the compounds of this invention are used at levels of about 0.001 to 20 kg ha with a preferred range of 0.01 to 10 kg ha. In general, the higher rates of application from within this range will be selected for adverse conditions or where extended persistence in soil is desired. The compounds of Formula I may be combined with other herbicides and are particularly useful in combination with the ureas such as 3 3,4 dichlorophenyl l,l dimethylurea diuron the triazines such as 2 chloro 4 ethylamino 6 isopropylamino 5 triazine atrazine the uracils such as 5 bromo 3 sec butyl6 methyluracil bromacil N phosponomethyl glycine glyphosate 3 cyclohexyl l methyl 6 dimethylamino s triazine 2,4 1H,3H dione hexazinone N1N dimethyl 2,2 diphenylacetamide diphenamid 2,4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid 2,4 D and closely related compounds 4 chloro 2 butynyl 3 chlorophenylcarbamate barban S 2,3 dichloroallyl di isopropylthiocar bamate diallate S 2,3,3 trichloroallyl diisopropylthiocarbamate triallate 1,2 dimethyl 3,5diphenyl lH pyrazolium methyl sulfate difenzoquat methyl sulfate methyl 2 4 2,4 dichlorophenoxy phenoxyGpropanoate diclofop methyl 4 amino 6tert butyl 3 methylthio 1,2,4 triazin 5 4H one metribuzin 3 3,4 dichlorophenyl 1 methoxy 1 methylurea linuron 3 isopropyl lH 2,1,3 benzo thiodiazin 4 3H one 2,2 dioxide bentazon , , trifluoro 2,6 dinitro N,N dipropyl 2 toluidine trifluralin l,l dimethyl 4,4 bipyridinium ion paraquat monosodium methanearsonate MSMA 2 chloro 2 ,6 diethyl methoxymethyl acetanilide alachlor p 1,1 dimethyl 3 , , trifluoro m tolyl urea fluometuron and 5 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl phenoxy 2 nitrobenzoic acid, methyl ester acifluorfen methyl . The activity of the compounds of formula I was investigated in a number of greenhouse tests. The tests are described and data resulting from them are shown below. Test A Seeds of crabgrass Digitaria spp. , barnyardgrass Echinochloa crusgalli , wild oats Avena fatua , cassia Cassia tora , morningglory Ipomoea sp. , cocklebur Xanthium spp. , sorghum, corn, soybean, rice, wheat and nutsedge tubers Cyperus rotundus were planted in a growth medium and treated preemergence with the chemicals dissolved in a non phytotoxic solvent solution of the compounds of Table A.At the same time, cotton having five leaves including cotyledonary ones , bush beans with the third trifoliate leaf expanding, crabgrass and barnyardgrass with two leaves, wild oats with two leaves, cassia with three leaves including cotyledonary ones , morningglory and cocklebur with four leaves including the cotyledonary ones , sorghum and corn with four leaves, soybean with two cotyledona ry leaves, rice with three leaves, wheat with one leaf, and nutsedge with threefive leaves were sprayed with a non phytotoxic solvent solution of the compounds of Table A. Other containers of the above mentioned weeds and crops were treated pre or post emergence with the same non phytotoxic solvent so as to provide a solvent control. A set of untreated control plants was also included for comparison.Pre emergence and post emergence treated plants and controls were maintained in a greenhouse for sixteen days, then all treated plant were compared with their respective controls and rated visually for response to treatment.

The experiment concerned pre emergence applications on soil. The containers used were 25 cm diameter plastic pots filled with Fallsington silt loam.One set of pots was planted to weeds, the seeds of which were uniformly mixed with the top 1.2 cm layer of soil.The species selected were johnsongrass Sorghum halepense , barnyardgrass Echinochloa crusgalli , crabgrass Digitaria sanguinalis , giant foxtail Setaria faberii , velvetleaf Abutilon theophrasti , jimsonweed Datura stramonium , mustard Brassica arvensis , and pigweed Amaranthus retroflexus . Another set of pots was panted to the following crops with from one to four species per pot corn planting depth 3.7 cm , cotton, soybeans, sunflower, Clinton oats, wheat, Black Valentine beans, rice, sorghum, peas, flax, and peanuts all at 2.5 cm depth , cucumbers, cabbage, alfalfa, safflower, sugarbeets, tomato, spinach, barley, and Kentucky bluegrass all at 1.2 cm depth . Immediately after planting, the test chemical was applied to the soil surfaces dissolved in a nonphytotoxic solvent.One pot from the weed phase and one of each of the crop species were left untreated for the purpose of comparison. The treated and untreated pots were promptly watered with approximately 4 mm of simulated rainfall and then held in a greenhouse for several weeks. Visual weed and crop response ratings were made 28 days after treatment utilizing the rating system as described above forTest A. The data are given in Table C.

The above two pans were treated pre emergence. At the same time two pans in which the above plant species were growing were treated post emergence. Plant height at the time of treatment ranged from 1 15 cm depending on plant species. The compounds applied were diluted with a nonphytotoxic solvent and sprayed over the top of the pans. An untreated control and a solvent alone control were included for comparison. All treatments were maintained in the greenhouse for 20 days at which time the treatments were compared to the controls and the effects visually rated. The recorded. data, presented in Table D, indicate that certain compounds from within the scope of the invention have utility for pre and or post emergence weed control in cereal crops such as wheat and barley.

Approximately 12 soybean plants were grown in a 25 cm. diameter plastic pot. In another pot of equal size the following broadleaf plant species were grown sugarbeets, velvetleaf,Sesbania, Cassia, mustard, morningglory, alfalfa, jimsonweed, and cocklebur. The plant foliage and surrounding soil were treated with the test chemical dissolved in a non phytotoxic solvent as an overall spray at the rate of 0.015 kg ha, when the plants were 17 days old. Visual ratings of herbicidal effects were made 22 days after treatment utilizing the rating system described for Test A.
