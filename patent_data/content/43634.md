# Metal oxide hydrogen cell.

## Abstract
A rechargeable metal oxide hydrogen cell includes an electrode stack 16 within a pressure vessel 10 . The electrode stack 16 is aligned on an alignment member 14 and has separate positive and negative bus bars 18, 20 coupling the positive and negative electrodes to their respective terminals. A variable conductance heat pipe 45, 48 couples the inside of tile electrode stack 16 to a radiator located outside the shell pressure vessel 10 . The heat pipe includes at least a portion of the alignment member and a working fluid such as Freon 21.
