# Even flow radiant burner tip.

## Abstract
A gas burner assembly 10 supported in an opening 12 in a furnace wall 14 has injected gas and or air flowing through an inner burner tube 30 thence outwardly through a plurality of openings 44 for burning along the surface of a wall 46 thus providing a near uniform radiant heat energy to the furnace. A flow divider 50 positioned opposite the openings 44 divides the flowing gas and or air to improve distribution, and retard flashback in the event of variations in fuel air mixture and or flow.

## Description
EVEN FLOW RADIANT BURNER TIP The present invention concerns a burner which inspirates or educts air with gas to burn beyond openings at the end of a burner tube. In addition, the invention is applicable to a burner that uses forced air or forced air and gas for burning outside openings at the end of a burner tube. The outlet slots or openings must allow maximum emission of the gas air mixture at sufficient velocity to prevent flashback into the burner tube. It is to be understood that the invention is for use with a variety of gas air, or air gas mixing burners. For example, the invention includes burners using forced air pr mixed with gas or alone, such as found in U.S. Patent No. 4,257,762, the invention being directed to the division of fluid flow at the downstream tip. It is an object of this invention to maintain efficient burning of radiant wall burner apparatus despite changes in velocity of the combustible gases and or changes in types of fuel. A particular feature of the invention provides a gas burner assembly for furnaces in which a stream of high velocity fuel gas issues from an orifice to inspirate combustion supporting air into and mix with the air in a mixing section of a burner pipe. The burner pipe is inserted into an oversized opening through the wall of the furnace terminating at a downstream end adjacent and beyond the inner wall of the furnace. The inner wall of the furnace surrounding the furnace opening typically includes a radiant wall surface. The downstream end of the burner pipe is closed. A plurality of openings such as slots or holes are provided in the burner pipe adjacent the downstream end to project gas air mixtures issuing therefrom, outwardly along the radiant furnace wall surface for burning.A flow divider comprised of an undersized cylindrical member is centrally located pernanently or temporarily inside the burner tube adjacent the downstream end. The downstream eni of the flow divider is oriented in close proxiity to the inside periphery of the burner tube at said openings to effectively divide the openings into what is defined herein as a downstream flowing portion and an upstream flowing portion. The cylindrical flow divider causes that portion of the fuel air mixture which passes through the inside of the flow divider to be directed throh the downstream portion of the openings.The remaining portion of the fuel air mixture which passes through the annular space located between the flow divider and the burner tube flows through the upstream portion of the openings. The invention will now be described further, by way of example, with reference to the accowpanying drawings, in which Fig. t is a partial sectional view describing the apparatus of this invention as it can be located in a furnace wall Pig. 2 is an enlarged sectional view of the tip of Fig. 1 Figs. 3 and 4 depict other embodiments of the invention and rigs. 5, 6 and 7 depict other forms of flow divider baffles within the scope of the invention. The burner assembly of Figs. 1 and 2, generally designated by the numeral 10, is inserted through an opening 12 formed as a part of a burner block 14 located through a furnace wall 16. The basic gas air mixing burner assembly shown here is merely typical, as the invention is not to be limited to that type shown. The burner assembly is supported by a mounting plate 18 as by welding or bolting to plates 20 and or 22. The mounting plate centrally supports a burner tube 30 and includes openings which may be regulated for the flow of secondary air as shown. Centering lugs 32 are provided in the annular space between the burner tube and the mounting thimble or plate 20.By supplying gas into an aspirator section 36 primary air, from a muffler 40, is caused to be inspirated at 38 into the burner tube 30 where it is mixed with the gas and thence caused to issue frown the downstream end 40. A conical shaped plug 42 typically closes the downstream end.A plurality of spaced openings or slots 44 are provided around the circumference of the downstream end of the burner tube 30. These openings 44 project gas and air essentially outwardly for burning along the furnace wall and a tile surface 46 wiz ch is capable of providing additional radiant heat energy to the interior of the furnace as is known in the art. The invention is particularly directed to a flow divider 50 which is provided in the interior of the burner tube, adjacent the downstream end. The flow divider is comprised of a cylinder which includes outwardly projecting lugs or feet 52 which centralize the flow divider in the position shown.Other forms of centralizer means such as protrusions from the body of the cylinder and the like can be provided. The flow divider can be permanently installed as by welding in a centralized position.The downstream end of the flow divider is caused to be oriented in close proximity to the inside periphery of the burner tube at the openings, thus dividing the openings into a downstream flow 54 and an upstream flow 56. In Fig. 3 a straight burner tube 60 is depicted having an end closure 62 and a plurality of slots 64 disposed inside the tip. In this embodiment the flow divider 66 disposed about the tip. In this embodiment the flow divider 66 with its centralizing members 68 is shown. Likewise, in Fig. 4 the primary distinction is the use of a burner tube 70, which may be straight or curved as shown, having an end closure 72 and a plurality of holes 74 surrounding the tip. The flow divider 76 with its centralizing members 78 is shown positioned with respect to that embodiment. Figs. 5, 6 and 7 depict different forms of flow dividers, such as an angularly inclined member 84 dividing slots 82 of Fig. 5, a right angle divider 86 dividing slots 88 of Fig. 6 and a beveled flow divider 90 dividing slots 92 of Fig. 7.
