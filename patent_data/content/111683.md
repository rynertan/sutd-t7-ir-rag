# Improved strain of Clostridium acetobutylicum and process for its preparation.

## Abstract
A process for preparing a novel, improved strain of solvent producing Clostridium is disclosed. A spore forming parent strain is grown in a continuous culturing reactor under conditions which provide a strain that gives improved yields of solvents in a shorter time than does the parent strain.
