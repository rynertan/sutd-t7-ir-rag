# QUICK TAKE UP BRAKE MASTER CYLINDER ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
A quick take up brake master cylinder assembly includes a compensation control and blow off valve unit 84 or 88. In one embodiment, a stamped valve body 118 forms a valve member 113 within a valve chamber 104 which permits compensation flow from the master cylinder reservoir chamber 68 to the pressurizing chambers 34. An O ring seal 130 controls a passage 134 from the valve chamber to the reservoir chamber, and acts as a valve to open the passage at a predetermined quick take up pressure to return fluid to the reservoir. Other embodiments use an umbrella valve 22 or a spring biased ball check valve 144. The valve housing in some embodiments also retains the reservoir body 40 in a sealed position on the master cylinder housing 12.
