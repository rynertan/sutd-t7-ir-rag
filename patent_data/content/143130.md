# An oriented multi layer popypropylene structure and a process of preparing the same.

## Abstract
An oriented multi layer polypropylene film structure having surface modifying agents on the surface thereof and is produced by coextruding and orienting a a base layer comprising polypropylene of comparatively high stereo regularity, the precursor resin of which contains an amide of a water insoluble monocarboxylic acid having from 8 to 24 carbon atoms, or a mixture of said amides and b a skin layer comprising a polyolefin of comparatively low stereo regularity on at least one surface of a , said skin layer containing a combination of finely divided silica and a silicone oil, whereby at least some of the amide of a migrates to the surface of b .
