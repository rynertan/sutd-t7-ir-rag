# Process for preparing ethylene glycol.

## Abstract
Ethylene glycol can be prepared in good yield with high selectivity by reacting a mixture of hydrogen, carbon mon oxide and formaldehyde in the presence of a catalyst com prising a cobalt containing compound in the presence of a substantially inert oxygenated hydrocarbon solvent at a superatmospheric pressure of at least 35 bars, and in the presence of a tin containing compound or a germanium containing compound as catalyst promoter.
