# POLYISOCYANATES

## Abstract
Polyisocyanates having oxadiazinetrione rings ob tained by reacting bis isocyanatomethyl cyclohexane, an oligomer thereof, an adduct thereof or a mixture of them with carbon dioxide. Said polyisocyanates have excellent properties as raw materials for the production of poly urethanes, because of their higher reactivity at lower temperature and better storage stability.
