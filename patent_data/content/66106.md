Certain diphenylethers have been found effective for control of noxious weeds however, herbicidal efficacy cannot be predicted from the substituent groups attached to the phenyl rings. More specifically compounds that are closely related frequently have markedly different capabilities for controlling weeds. Often, the diphenylether compounds have overlapping or complimentary areas of activity or selectivity such that combinations of these prior compounds were required for controlling a variety of weeds in a given area. Many of said prior diphenylether compounds are only marginally effective and many leave undesirable residues in the soil as a consequence of low biodegradability or required heavy dosages. Ideally, a herbicide should provide selective control over an entire growing season after a single application at low dosage rates and should be capable of destroying common weeds as seeds, germinating seeds, seedlings and growing or mature plants. Such herbicides as are recommended for crop treatment should also be non toxic to desirable vegetation and to the soil. Most beneficially, these herbicides should be dissipatable leaving no harmful residue. The present herbicidal compounds combine most of these desirable properties their efficacy being attributable to the active groups defined byA I through A VI in formula 1 above. Most active of the present herbicides are those having a sulfur or oxygen atom in the A side chain and, of these, the side chain defined by formula II exhibits the highest activity in both post emergent and pre emergent treatments as well as exceptional crop selectivity and high degradability in the soil. The following specific compounds illustrate the various types of herbicides providing the above benefits however, these are not to be construed as limiting to the scope of the invention as more properly defined by formula 1.

herbicides of the present invention can be prepared by various methods.For example, the compounds defined in formula 1 where A represents group I are most advantageously prepared by reacting a substituted phenoxybenzoyl chloride with a suitable alcohol or thiol, or by direct esterification of the phenoxybenzoic acids with the alcohols or thiols according to theEMI33.1 SEP 0 tb equation SEP

prepared either by reacting the sodium or potassium salt of 3 hydroxybenzoic acid with suitably substituted halobenzenes, followed by aromatic ring nitration with a conventional nitrating agent, or by reacting the sodium or potassium salt of a correspondingly substituted phenol with 5 halo 2 nitrobenzoic acid. The phenoxybenzoyl chlorides are synthesized by reacting the corresponding benzoic acid with a chlorinating agent such as thionyl chloride. Those compounds represented by formula 1 wherein A is group II or group VI are advantageously prepared by reacting precurser I with II or precurser III with IV , as follows EMI34.1 where W in II and III is chlorine or bromine G is X nR6 or R8 and L, M, N, Y, X, R5, X , X n, R6 and R8 are as defined previously. The reactions may be carried out in the presence or absence of a base, and with or without a solvent. Compound I in the equations is prepared by reacting mshenoxybenzoic acid halide VI with reactant VIII . Compound IV in the equations is synthesized by reacting an acid halide,EMI34.2 with reactant Vm , as shown below.These reactionsEMI34.3 may be carried out in the presence or absence of a base, and with or without a solvent. The X H or XH functionality in VIII may be protected before condensation by reaction with a suitable protecting agent, such as chiorotrimethylsilane, which is removed later to regenerate the X H or XH group. The ester I, X X oxygen , is also prepared from the corresponding alcohols by reaction with m phenoxybenzoic acid XI in the presence of aEMI35.1 tb catalyst, SEP preferably SEP an SEP acid SEP as SEP follows SEP 0 tb SEP 9 SEP ii tb SEP L SEP o SEP CKH SEP SEP HOR SEP 50H SEP H SEP SEP vo SEP OR50H tb NL tb SEP N SEP Y SEP N SEP Y tb SEP IX SEP I,X X O tb Other methods of preparation will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the structure of the herbicides defined herein. The herbicides represented in formula 1 having group A III are best prepared by reacting a correspondingly substituted phenoxybenzoyl chloride with a suitable polyhydroxy compound. A convenient method for preparing the herbicides of formula 1 whereA is group IV is illustrated by the reaction of a substituted phenoxybenzoyl chloride with a suitable alcohol, amine, or thiol, or by the direct acylation of the phenoxybenzoic acids with the alcohols, amines or thiols. Preferably the reaction is run at about a 2 1 ratio of, e.g. acid to alcohol. Alternatively, an excess of alcohol may be used, e.g. a 1 5 ratio of acid to alcohol, to produce the mono intermediate, followed by self ester exchange at about 1000 250 C. while distilling out alcohol to produce the desired bis compound. Finally, the herbicides of formula I wherein A represents group V are prepared by reacting a substituted phenoxybenzoyl chloride with a suitable diol or its alkali metal salt, or by direct esterification of the phenoxybenzoic acid with the diol. All of the above synthesis are carried out at a temperature of between about 200C. and 2500C. under 1 5 atmospheres, preferably under atmospheric pressure with agitation. Examples 1 through 70 in the following disclosure provide a more detailed description for the preparation of the above herbicidal compounds although it is to be understood that other methods of synthesis may be employed if desired. In addition to the above described processes, a novel and convenient method for preparing herbicides of Formula 1 having the side chains of A I, III, IV and V and also having a side chain where A is X alkylene XH is described by the reaction of a phenoxybenzoic acid with a diacylating agent, such as a diol or dithiol to produce the corresponding bis compound. Examples of suitable acylating agents include ethylene glycol, 2 hydroxyethyl ether, 2,2 thiodiethanol, 1,2 ethanedithiol, ethylenediamine, 2 mercaptoethanol, 1,4 butenediol, 2 hydroxyethyl sulfide, and the like. This novel synthesis is defined by a 2 , 3 or 4 step process wherein the first 2 steDs involve reacting a substituted Dhenoxvbenzoic acid having the formulaEMI36.1 tb SEP 9 tb OH tb 0 SEP w SEP 4S SEP A. tb wherein L , M , and N are independently hydrogen, halogen, trihalomethyl, nitro, cyano, C14 alkyl, C1 4 alkoxy orEMI36.2 with a diacylating agent having the formula HXA X H wherein A is R5,EMI36.3 or CH2 nR6 OH p i at a temperature between about 200 and about 2000C. under from about 1 to about 5 atmospheres pressure for a period of from about 1 to about 40 hours preferably at a temperature between about 1000 and 1500C. under atmospheric pressure for a period of from about 10 to about 40 hours, to produce the corresponding biEMI36.4 tb s compound SEP having SEP the SEP Formula tb SEP L SEP C SEP XA X tb LM ffi oX SEP 1 SEP 2 SEP B. tb and then nitrating the bis compound with a conventional nitrating agent at a 0 and about 70 temperature between about and about 70 C. under atmospheric pressure for a period of from about 1 to about 10 hours preferably at a temperature between about OOC. and about 300C. for a period of from about 1 to about 5 hours, to produce the corresponding nitrated compound having the formula EMI36.5 It will be appreciated that when A is R5, the product of formula 1 A IV is directly produced by the second step, i.e. nitration step C. The above nitration step can be carried out in the absence or in the presence of an inert solvent, such as methylene dichloride, ethylene dichloride, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, etc. Suitable nitrating agents include nitric acid sulfuric acid, potassium nitrate sulfuric acid, nitric acid sulfuric acid acetic anhydride and other conventional nitrating mixtures. When a solvent is employed, the concentration of the bis compound can be varied over a wide range limited only by economic considerations however, it is found that concentrations between aboutlO and about 80 weight percent provides good results. The mole ratio of diacylating agent to the phenoxybenzoic acid is most preferably about 1 2. The mole ratio of NO2 in the nitrating agent is most preferably 2 1 with respect to the intermediate bis compound although a greater excess of nitrating agent, can be employed if desired. When compounds of formula 1 having A group I, Ifl and V are desired, the nitrated product of the 2 step process described above is transacylated by reacting it with at least an equimolar amount of an above described diacylating agent at a temperature of between about 200 and about 2500C.under from about 1 to about 5 atmospheres pressure for a period of 0.5 to about 20 hours preferably at a temperature between about 1400 and about 2000C. under atmospheric pressure for a period of from about 1 to 10 hours.EMI37.1 tb The SEP reaction SEP is SEP generally SEP defined SEP by SEP the SEP equation SEP 9 tb SEP 0 SEP 1 SEP CXA X H tb SEP SEP 2 SEP HXA X H SEP 2 SEP SEP Ilooo SEP SEP XA X SEP 2 SEP 01 SEP D. tb NI SEP NO2 SEP N SEP NO2 tb SEP 2 tb The transacylating step .15 preferably carried out in a presence of a transacylating catalyst such as sulfuric acid, p toluene sulfonic acid, hydrogen halide, hydrated manganese acetate, boron trifluoride etherate, phosphoric acid, calcium oxide, barium oxide, lead oxide, sodium oxide, lead nitrate, zinc acetate, manganese borate, zinc borate or an acidic ion exchange resin. Of these transesterification catalysts, manganese acetate tetrahydrate has been found to be very effective. The mole ratio of diacylating agent employed in this third step of the reaction is between about 1 1 and 50 1, preferably between about 3 1 and about 20 1 with respect to the nitrated product of Step C.The excess and unreacted diacylating agent in this stage functions as a solvent for the transacylation reaction and is preferably separated from the product for recycle. When the 3 step process is carried out in batch operation the various coreactants in each step are added sequentially after substantial completion of the preceding reaction. However, the synthesis may also be effected in separate reactors operated in series with heating and or cooling devices between the various stages, as required. Also unreacted components may be separated from product and recycled to the appropriate stage. To obtain the products of A groups II and Vl,the product of equation D is reacted with a carbonyl containing compound of the formulaEMI38.1 or the acid halide or anhydride of such carbonyl containing compounds wherein X, X and n are as defined above and G is . X n R6 or R8, according to the reaction defined by equation E EMI38.2 Reaction E is effected at a temperature of between about 0 C. and about 200 C, under a pressure of from atmospheric to about 5 atmospheres over a period of from 0.5 to 20 hours preferably at between about 25 C. and about 750C. under atmospheric pressure over a period of from about l to 10 hours. Suitable carbonylating agents include acetic acid, chloroacetic acid, thioacetic acid, N,N dimethylcarbamyl chloride, pyruvic acid, propionic acid, methoxyacetyl chloride, acetic anhydride, phthalic anhydride, and the like. The carbonyl containing reactant is employed in a mole ratio of from about 1 1 to about 20 1 with respect to the product of reaction D. If desired the carbonylation can be effected in the presence of an inert solvent, e.g.tetrahydrofuran, and any of those previously given for the nitration reactionC. However, this reaction can be effected in the absence of solvent or in the presence of excess carbonyl containing compound which excess may function as a recyclable solvent to this stage of the reaction. The phenoxybenzoates of this invention may be applied in any amount which will give the required control of weeds depending on the type of weed and degree of infestation. A preferred rate of application of the benzoates is from 0.05 to 8 lbs. per acre. In practical application, the compounds may be applied in solid, liquid or in vaporized form, or, as it is generally done, as an active ingredient in a standard herbicidal composition or formulation which comprises a carrier. A generally accepted carrier is a substance which can be used to dissolve, disperse or diffuse the herbicidal components in the composition.Non limiting examples of liquid carriers include water, organic solvents such as alcohols, ketones, halogenated hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, ethers, amides, esters, nitriles, mineral oils, palm oil and the like. Non limiting examples of solid carriers include Kaolin, bentonite, talc, diatomaceous earth, vermiculite, clay, gypsum, grain and seed hulls, ground corn cobs and the like.In addition to a carrier, it is usually desirable to add to the herbicidal formulation additives such as emulsifying agents, wetting agents, binding agents, stabilizer and the like or thickeners as desired for particular weather conditions or applications. The compounds may be formulated, for example, as a dust, wettable powders, paste, emulsifiable concentrates, granular formulations or as liquids or aerosols. The phenoxybenzoates of this invention may be applied along with plant growth regulators, insecticides, fungicides, nematocides and fertilizers.They may be applied in combination with one or more other herbicides. Non Limiting examples of other herbicides which can be incorporated with the phenoxybenzoates of this invention are anilides, such as N methoxymethyl 2,6 diethylphenyl chloroacetamide dinitroanilines, such as , trifluoro 2, 6 dinitro N ,N di propyl p toluidine carboxylic acids and derivatives triazines substituted ureas carbamates thiocarbamates uracils heterocycles and organo phosphorous compounds.
