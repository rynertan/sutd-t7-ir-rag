# Cladding cathodes of electrolytic cell with diaphragm or membrane.

## Abstract
A method of cladding a separator, that is a diaphragm or membrane, to a cathode box 1 of the pocket type compris ing a plurality of foraminate walls, the method comprising positioning a separator in the form of a sleeve 24 in each pocket 10 of the cathode box 1 with the ends of the sleeves 24 projecting beyond the ends of the pockets 10 , placing a first sheet material 27 in contact with those parts of the sleeves 24 projecting beyond the ends 26 of the pockets 10 in one direction and sealing the sleeves 24 to the sheet material 27 , placing a second sheet material 27 in contact with those parts of the sleeves 24 projecting beyond the ends 26 of the pockets 10 in the opposite direction and sealing the sleeves 24 to the second sheet material 27 , and removing those parts 29 of the sheet materials adjacent to the ends 26 of the pockets 10 . Also a cathode box clad with separator, and an electrolytic cell comprising a cathode box clad with separator.
