## Description
TIN BASE ALLOY FOR SOLDERING, HAVING HIGH RESISTANCE TO THE OXIDATIONIN THE MOLTEN STATE.This invention is relevant to a tin base alloy suitable for soldering metallic pieces and particularly fit for use in apparatuses for automatic soldering wherein the soldering alloy in the molten state, arranged in a proper open container cup , is brought into contact with the piece to be soldered for a very short time. This soldering method, as it is well known, is largely used in the manufacture of printed circuits.The known apparatuses can be basically classified in two types those having a static soldering bath wherein the printed circuit to be soldered is plunged for a very short time in the molten alloy, and those having a dynamic soldering bath or wave bath wherein the molten alloy, conveyed by a suitable pump, forms a stationary wave on which the printed circuit to be soldered is passed over, in this way a contact between the soldering alloy and the piece being obtained for a very short time.It is well known that in this type of manufacturing the soldering alloy must secure a perfect soldering of every connection point of the circuit, contemporaneously and in very short time. Moreover it must allow a working temperature not too high in order to avoid damagements of the components of the printed circuit. Consequently it is requested the use of high purity tin lead alloys having composition equal to or near the eutectic one about 63 by w. tin and melting point about 1830C . A remarkable trouble of the above mentioned methods, wherein a large amount of molten alloy is kept at working temperature, in the order of 2500 C, consists in the formation of metal oxide on the surface of the bath.This oxide can then mix with other substances present in the manufacturing such as, for example, soldering fluxes, and therewith it causes drosses which form on the surface of the bath and which have to be continuously removed in order to avoid trouble in the contact between the molten alloy and the points to be soldered.The formation of oxides and consequently of drosses beside causing a loss of metallic alloy, in particular of tin, involves also a loss of time and more complexity of the operation due to the necessity of removing the above said oxides and drosses. The drosses sometime can mix with a certain amount of molten metal and this fact increases further the real loss of metal.It has been now ascertained that an alloy consisting of tin, lead and antimony and containing also very little amount of phosphorus, shows a tendency to the oxidation at working temperatures of the above mentioned soldering processes, which is much more less than that of the conventional tin lead alloys used in this technical field and of the same ternary alloys Sn Pb Sb already known in the art.The alloy according to the present invention contains from 51 to 57.5 by w. of tin, from 2 to 3.6 of antimony, from 0,015 to 0,001 of phosphorus, the balance to 100 being lead.It has been ascertained, and this fact makes up an essential aspect of the present invention, that the very little amounts of phosphorus present in the alloy according to the invention, do not interfere with other substances present in the soldering process such as the fluxes and the liquid oil used in wave bath as protective sheet and as soldering coadiuvant. Tne solucr rn pe ormances of the alloy according to the invention arc optic l and in any case not lower than that of the corresponding , or art alloys.The preferred compositions are the following from 54 to 57 by w.of Sn, from 2 to 3 of Sb, from 0. 007 to 0. 002 of phosphorus the balance to 100 being lead. The vry little amount of phosphorus present in the alloy according to the invention doesn t change notably the melting temperature and the solidification range in comparison with the same alloys not containing phosphorus.The extremely reduced oxidability in the molten state of the alloy according to the invention shows itself both in the use in static bath and in that of dynamic bath or wave bath . The formation of oxides and consequently of drosses is extremely reduced, the bath of molten alloy remains for long time perfectly clean on the surface, the removal of drosses can be carried out at time interval much longer than that which occur with the usual alloys Sn Sb having 60 or 63 by w. of tin, or with the ternary alloys Sn Pb Sb already known from the prior art and containing from 1.5 to 4 by w. of Sb and from 50 to 57.5 of Sn.Such alloys are described for instance by theFrench Patent 2.302.346 and in Gmelins Handbuch der anorganischenChemie vol.47 C pages 1515 and 1539 table a ternary alloy is shown having 55 by w. of tin, 3.6 of antimony and 41.4 of lead and melting point minimum of 1830 C. These alloys show some advantages in front of the conventional tin lead alloys containing 60 or 63 of tin. With decreased percentage of tin and consequently with a reduced cost of the whole starting materials, it is possible to obtain alloy having low melting point, about the same of the eutectic alloy Sr. Pb with 63 Sn about lB30C . The soldering obtained with the above mentioned ternary alloys shows very good mechanical properties and a glossy appearance which persists for a long time. Furthermore the presence of antimony could reduce, in certain circumstances, the oxidability of the alloy at the use temperature.The alloy according to the invention shows all the advantages above cited for the ternary alloys Sn Pb Sb of the prior art and furthermore affords a resistance to the oxidation, in the molten state, much higher than that of the ternary alloys of the prior art.The preparation of the alloy according to the invention is carried out according to conventional methods the metal components are completely molten and then phosphorus is introduced in form of tin phosphorus composition or alloy which is prepared according to prior art processes. It is possible to use tin phosphorus alloys having a very low content of phosphorus, in the average of 1 by w. and also much less.The molten mass has to be kept at temperature preferably not less than 3000C during the addition of the tin phosphorus alloys and subsequently, after casting into mold, has to be cooled rapidly. In this way a perfectly homogeneous alloy is obtained. An easy method for preparing the ternary Sn Pb Sb alloy containing phosphorus consists in melting the whole amount of Pb and increasing the temperature of the molten metal at a value higher than the melting point of the antimony about 6300C . Then the antimony is added and it melts rapidly consequently it is immediately diluted in the mass of molten lead.In this way a possible oxidation of the antimony to Sb 203 is avoided.Thereafter the tin is introduced and finally the tin phosphorous alloy in amount corresponding to the preestablished content of phosphorus in the final alloy, is added at temperature of at least 3000 C. Further step of the preparation as above said, with a fast cooling of the alloy.The following examples are reported as illustrative of the present invention and are not limiting the same. EXAMPLE 1 41.5 parts by w. of Pb are melted and the temperature is increased to 6500C, in the molten mass are then introduced 2.5 parts of Sb and the molten mass is mixed. Then 51.8 parts of Sn are added, the temperature is raised till 3000C and thereafter 4.82 parts of tin containing 0.11 by w. of phosphorus are added. The molten mass is cast in ingot mold provided with water cooling. The obtained alloy has the composition 56 by w. Sn, 41.5 Pb, 2.5 Sb and 0.0053 P. For this alloy a solidification range of 7.70C has been ascertained start of solidification at 187.20C, end at 185.50C .This alloy has been placed in a open cup of stainless steel, rectangular shape cm 20 x 10 and depth cm 7, provided with electrical heating and kept at constant temperature at 2500C. In two equal cups, always kept at 2500C, were placed comparison alloys, namely comparison A alloy Sb Pb with 60 by w.Sn comparison B alloy 56 Sn, 41.5 Pb, 2.5 SbIn order to survey the behaviour in front of the oxidation, all traces of oxide and dross were removed mechanically from the surface of the molten alloy, in the three cups contemporaneously and thereafter the following surveys were carried out after 1 minute one notes in comparison A a bluish colouring due to a very thin film of oxide on the surface of the molten alloy which nevertheless maintains mirror like appearance in comparison B one notes the same behaviour, the colouring however is very soft and finally the alloy according to the invention shows a surface per fectly mirror like, without any change in appearance after 5 minutes from the beginning of the test one notes in compa rison A and B an intense colouring gold yellow due to a thin film of oxide the alloy according to the invention shows none surface change after 10 minutes from the oeginnsng one notes in ccm r sc.ns h and E the formation cf a remarkable film G xid t j,g all C arcor ing to the invention shows none surface change after 15 minutes the alloy according to the invention does not show any detectable trace of oxidation, the surface is perfectly uncha i ged and mirror like.The above said alloy has been used in the soldering of printed circuits in apparatus of wave bath type, at 2500 C. For comparison purpose the same soldering process has been carried out with comparisonB alloy and with a conventional Sn Pb alloy containing 63 Sn.The results obtained with the alloy of the invention were completely similar to those obtained with comparison B alloy, in particular as regards the completeness of the soldering points, the bright look, the absence of defects as bridges and stalactites . The characteristics of the soldering were in the whole as good as those obtained with Sn Pb alloy containing 63 Sn.After a certain working time the whole amount of drosses, formed during the operation, was measured. The amounts measured in the tests come out to be in the following ratios between them considering the value 100 for the amount formed from the eutectic alloy Sn Pb, we obtained the value 92 for the comparison B alloy and the value 30 for the alloy according to the invention. EXAMPLE 2An alloy of composition 55 Sn, 3 Sb, 42 Pb and 0.002 P was prepared with the method described in Example 1.This alloy subjected to the oxidation test in the open cup, as described in Example 1, after 20 minutes at 2500C did not show any surface change or colouring, the look remaining perfectly r r,or like. EXAMPLE 3The same alloy of Example 2 was prepared, but containing phosphorus in amount of 0.01 by w. The oxidation test in the open cup gave the same result of Example 2.
