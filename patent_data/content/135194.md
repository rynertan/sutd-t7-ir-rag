The alkali metal salt of methanol includes lithium methoxide, sodium methoxide, potassium methoxide, etc.As the halogenating agent, use is made of halogenicompounds capable of liberating a cationic halogen atom, such as halogen exemplified by chlorine and bromine, N haloimides exemplified by N chlorosuccinimide and N bromosccinimide, N haloamides exemplified by N chloroacetamide and N bromoacetamide, Nhalosulfonamides exemplified by N chlorobenzenesulfonamide and N chloro p toluenesulfonamide, l halobenzotriazoles and organic hypochlorites exemplified by tert butyl hypochlorite.This reaction is carried out in a solvent. As the solvent, use can be made of, for example, tetrahydrofuran , dioxane, dichloromethane, chloroform, acetonitrile, methanol, N,N dimethylformamide, N,N dimethylacetamide, etc. or mixed solvents thereof as well as any of other solvents which do not affect this reaction. The reaction is carried out by dissolving or suspending the starting compound Xvi in the above mentioned solvent and adding an alkali metal salt of methanol, methanol and halogenating agent to the solution or suspension to allow the reaction to proceed, whereby it is preferable to add not less than one mole of methanol, one to 3.5 moles of an alkali metal salt of methanol and about one to two moles of a halogenating agent against one mole of the starting compound XV to allow the reaction to proceed.The reaction proceeds easily under cooling or at room temperature to not more than 3O0C, and is quenched by acidifying the reaction system. As the acid suitable for the cessation of the reaction, use is made for example of formic acid, acetic acid and trichloroacetic acid. After the cessation of the reaction, the excess halogenating agent is removed by the treatment with a reducing agent such as sodium thiosulfate and trialkyl ester of phosphorous acid. The reaction terminates normally in a few minutes to ten odd hours, preferably in 0.5 to a few hours. The derivatives 1I as obtained by the processes according to the above reaction formulas t1 through 4 may be obtainable in the form of a compound with any high degree of purity by the separation and purification means known per se such as solvent extraction, recrystallization and chromatography. When the derivative I thus obtained has a free carboxy group, generally, it can form a salt through the action on a base. Therefore, the derivatives I are in some instances collected in the form of a salt, and the compound obtained in the form of a salt may be converted into the free form or into other salts. Furthermore, the derivatives I obtained in the free form may be converted into its salt. As the method of converting the derivatives I obtained in the form of a salt into the free form, for example, the method comprising the use of an acid is employed.The acid used varies depending upon the type of protective groups and other conditions, and as the acid, frequent use is made of inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid and organic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid and p toluenesulfonic acid. In addition acidic ion exchange resins and the like are employed. As the solvent, use is in many cases made of hydrophilic organic solvents such as acetone, tetrahydrofuran, methanol, ethanol and dioxane, water or mixed solvents. This method is normally conducted at room temperature, but may also be carried out under cooling to under warming. The reaction time varies with the types of acid and solvent as well as the temperature, but it is generally preferred that the reaction be completed in a short period.The resulting derivatives I in the free form can be isolated by the known methods as mentioned above. When the derivativeslI having a free carboxy group areobtained, the carboxy group can be derived into an ester by the known methods. Of the starting compounds that are used in the abovedescribed processes for producing the derivatives I , the starting compound fIV can be synthesized, for example1 in the above processes of the reaction formulas 1 through 4 by the procedure of deprotecting the compound VII , Xl, XIII or XVI3 or procedures similar thereto, and the starting compound. V and the compounds VI , lIX and XII can be prepared for example by the below described processes or their analogous processes.However, these examples are not intended to restrict the starting compounds, and any compound can be used, only if it meets thepurposeof this invention.

The conversion into diethyl 2R,3R epoxysuccinate XXIV cnbe accomplished for example in accordance with the methods as described in Tetrahedron, 36, 87 1980 and the Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 110683 1981. 2R,3R epoxysuccinic acid lX aZIJw the starting compound in the process 5 , can be easily obtained for example by the fermentation process as described in The Journal of MedicinalChemistry, 6, 233 1963 , etc., and is a highly valuable compound.The compound XXXIIJ can be derived into the compound XXIV through esterification according to the conventional procedure, and is useful as a starting material for the production of optically active 2 azetidinones having various 4 substituents.
