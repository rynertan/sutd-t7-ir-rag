# Scanning electron microscope and detection configuration therefor.

## Abstract
A new detection configuration of a Scanning Electron Microscope SEM , allows the imaging of the surfaces of a specimen at atmospheric pressure but which can be used also at conventional reduced pressures. In this configuration the detector means, such as a backscattered electron detector 2, is placed between a final aperture 4 and the electron column. The final aperture is very restricted and acts as a pressure limiting aperture through which slight leakage towards the column can occur. The electron beam 6 passes through the final aperture, reaches a sample 7 under ambient, e.g. atmospheric conditions and the backscattered electrons or other signals are allowed to reach the detector 2. The new configuration makes it possible for specimens or materials to be viewed in an open room. To further reduce leakage into the column, an evacuating duct 3 may be provided immediately behind the aperture 4 and within the thickness of the detector 2.
