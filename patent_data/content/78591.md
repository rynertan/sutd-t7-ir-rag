# The production of methanol via catalytic coal gasification.

## Abstract
Methanol is produced by gasifying a carbonaceous feed material with steam in the presence of a carbon alkali metal catalyst and added hydrogen and carbon monoxide to produce a raw product gas comprising methane, steam, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrogen and hydrogen sulfide which is treated for the removal of steam, particu lates, hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide. The treated gas is separated into a methane rich gas stream and a gas stream containing primarily carbon monoxide and hydro gen and the latter gas stream is passed to a methanol synthesis reactor where the carbon monoxide is reacted with the hydrogen in the presence of a methanol synthesis catalyst to form methanol which is recovered from the effluent leaving the methanol synthesis reactor thereby leaving a gas comprising carbon monoxide, hydrogen, methane and carbon dioxide, a portion of which is passed to a steam reforming furnace wherein at least a portion of the methane is reacted with steam to produce hydrogen and carbon monoxide which is then passed from the steam reforming furnace into the gasifier.
