Specifically, the new compounds of this invention are central nervous system depressants and may be used as tranquilizers or ataractic agents for the relief of anxiety and tension states, for example, in mice, cats, rats, dogs and other mammalian species such as man, in the same manner as chlordiazepoxide. For this purpose a compound or mixture of compounds of formula I , or non toxic physiologically acceptable salts, such as acid addition salts thereof, may be administered orally or parenterally in a conventional dosage form such as tablet, pill, capsule, injectable or the like. The dosage in mg kg of body weight of compounds of the present invention in mammals will vary according to the size of the animal and particularly with respect to the brain body weight ratio. In general, a higher mg kg dosage for a small animal such as a dog will have the same effect as a lower mg kg dosage in an adult human. A minimum effective dosage for a compound of formula I will be at least about 0.1 mg kg of body weight per day for mammals with a maximum dosage for a small mammal such as a dog, of about 100 mg kg per day. For humans, a dosage of about 0.1 to 12 mg kg per day will be effective, for example, about 5 to 600 mg day for an average man. The dosage can be given once daily or in divided doses, for example, 2 to 4 doses daily, and such dosage will depend on the duration and maximum level of activity of a particular compound. The dose may be conventionally formulated in an oral or parenteral dosage form by compounding about 5 to 250 mg per unit of dosage of conventional vehicle, excipient, binder, preservative, stabilizer, flavor or the like as called for by accepted pharmaceutical practice, for example, as described in U.S. Patent 3,755,340. The compounds of this invention may be used in pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of formula I as previously described or be contained in the same formulation with or co administered with one or more known drugs.
