# Method of rapidly dissolving polymers in water.

## Abstract
Water soluble polymers are rapidly dissolved in water by dispersing finely divided particles of the polymer into a liquid carrier in which the polymer is insoluble to form a suspension. The suspension is then added to water in order to release the polymer into the water as discrete particles that rapidly dissolve. The polymer particles are prepared by cryogenic grinding, or another non molecular destructive process.
