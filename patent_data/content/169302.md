## Description
US A 43 99 284, EP A 0 095 901 and EP A 0 022 529 describe the application of N Methylglucamine for the resolution of Naproxen and its precursors. This invention relates to a process for the resolution of 2 2 p fluorophenyl 5 benzoxazolyl propionic acid, indicated for brevity as FBP. More particularly, the invention relates to a process for the resolution of FBP, based on treatment with N R glucamine, indicated for brevity as NRG, in which R is an alkyl radical of 1 to 12 carbon atoms, or a cycloalkyl radical of 3 to 6 carbon atoms, in order to obtain 2 2 p fluorophenyl 5 benzoxazolyl propionic acid, indicated for brevity as FBP, whereas the levorotatory antipode, namely 2 2 p fluorophenyl 5 benzoxazolyl propionic acid, indicated for brevity as FBP, is racemised, preferably by means of the formation of one of its esters, and is recycled to the treatment with NRG. FBP acid is an effective anti inflammatory agent, which is considerably more powerful than phenylbutazone and considerably less toxic. Its anti inflammatory activity exceeds that of the corresponding raceme acid, and thus obtaining it with adequate optical purity, such that its specific rotation α 20 D is between 60 and 68 c 2 DMF , is of considerable interest. The preparation of FBP is described for example in British Patent 1,495,488 and in Italien Patent 22454 A 82, which state that in spite of numerous attempts at isolating FBP from the corresponding raceme acid by fractional crystallisation of diastereoisomer salts, this method does not give positive results, and a process is described for obtaining FBP from 2 4 hydroxy 3 nitrophenyl propionitrile by various stages which should be carried out under non racemising conditions. In reality, the FBP obtained in this manner requires further purification process in order to obtain the required degree of optical purity. EP A 0007116 describes the use of N methyl glucamine NMG as resolving agent for naproxen but it does not suggest such use for any other racemic mixture. We have now surprisingly found that it is possible to obtain FBP by resolution of FBP, operating by a process which enables said product to be obtained with a high yield and a high degree of optical purity. Further advantages of the process according to the present invention are the use of easily recoverable economical solvents, a low ratio of solvent volume to the quantity of raceme substrate, the use of a low cost, easily recoverable resolving agent, and a high recovery yield of the undesired antipode, which is racemised and recycled. The process according to the present invention is characterised by being carried out in accordance with the following stages These and further characteristics and advantages of the process according to the present invention will be more apparent from the description given hereinafter which relates to preferred methods of implementing the invention, and is given for illustrative purpose. The FBP and the NRG are dissolved under hot conditions in an organic solvent, in which the FBP NRG and FBP NRG salts form. The quantity of NRG used varies from 0.5 to 1 mole per mole of FBP. When less that 1 mole of NRG is used, the salification of the acid can be completed by adding an organic or inorganic base such as an alkylamine, an alkaline or alkaline earth hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide etc. The use of less than 1 mole of NRG is preferable for economical reasons. The operation is carried out at a FBP concentration of between 1.00 and 0.01 g l and preferably between 0.25 and 0.05 g l, at a temperature of between 0 and 150 C, and preferably between 20 and 100 C. The solvent used can be alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol and i.propanol, aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene and toluene, esters such as ethyl acetate, ketones such as acetone and methylethylketone, halogenated hydrocarbons such as chloroform, or mixtures of said solvents. If necessary, water can also be added to the solvent in a quantity sufficient to solubilise under hot conditions all the organic compounds which have been added to the solvent. The reaction mixture obtained as heretofore described is cooled slowly, under agitation, to a temperature of between 0 C and 100 C to obtain fractional crystallisation with the preferential precipitation of the FBP NRG. The FBP NRG salt is separated by filtration at a temperature of preferably between 0 C and 30 C, and is washed with solvent. It is then suspended in water at a temperature of 25 100 C and then treated with organic mineral acids such as acetic acid, HCl or H₂SO₄ in order to release the FBP acid, which can be recovered by simple filtration, or by extraction with a solvent followed by the evaporation of this latter. In this manner, the FBP is obtained with a yield of between 70 and 90 and having specific rotation of between 60 and 68 c 2 DMF . The fractional precipitation of the FBP NRG salt can be repeated if the specific rotation of the released FBP does not fall within the indicated limits. The mother liquors originating from the fractional crystallisation, and containing a C₁ C₁₂ alcohol either initially or after suitable addition, are acidified with mineral acid and heated to a temperature of between 30 C and the boiling point of the mixture under reflux, for a time of between 1 and 10 hours, to obtain the formation of the corresponding FBP ester. This mixture is then treated at a temperature of between 25 C and the reflux temperature with a base such as Na or K hydroxide or methylate in a molar ratio with respect to the FBP ester of between 1.5 and 5.0. After acidification, this mixture provides an FBP acid with a of between 0 and 6 c 2 DMF , which is recycled to the first stage. The FBP can also be racemised directly in an acid or basic environment by known methods. The NRG is recovered by known methods, and then recycled to the first stage. The FBP and NRG salts are new products. The following examples of the process according to the present invention are given by way of non limiting illustration. A suspension of 4.0 g 0.02 moles of N methyl glucamine in 30 ml of methanol was heated to 60 C, and a solution of 11.4 g 0.04 moles of FBP and 2.0 g 0.02 moles of triethylamine in 20 ml of methanol, also heated to 60 C, was added. The solution thus obtained was allowed to cool slowly to a temperature of 20 C so that the FBP salt crystallised. The precipitate was filtered off and washed on the filter with methanol. A sample of N methyl glucamine dry salt had a melting point of 173 174 C and a specific rotation of 3.5 c 1 in DMF . The precipited was suspended in 50 ml of water, and the mixture was acidified to pH 1 with a 37 weight aqueous solution of HCl. After extracting with ethyl acetate and evaporating the solvent, 4.9 g of FBP with a specific rotation of 67.6 c 2 DMF were obtained. 6.1 g of FBP with a specific rotation of 47.3 c 2 in DMF were obtained from the mother liquors after concentrating the solvent and recovering by an analogous procedure. Example 1 was repeated, operating under the described conditions, but with the difference that the N methyl glucamine was added in solid form to 50 ml of a methanolic solution of the other components heated to 60 C. 4.7 g of FBP with a specific rotation of 67.8 c 2 in DMF were obtained. Example 1 was repeated, operating under the described conditions but with the difference that a total of 50 ml of ethanol was used instead of methanol. 4.9 g of FBP with a specific rotation of 64.8 c 2 in DMF were obtained. Example 1 was repeated, operating under the described conditions but with the difference that the total of 80 ml of i.propanol were used instead of methanol. 5.5 g of FBP with a specific rotation of 50.4 c 2 DMF were obtained. Example 1 was repeated, operating under the described conditions but with the difference that a total of 80 ml of ethyl acetate was used instead of methanol. 5.0 g of FBP with a specific rotation of 45.1 c 2 DMF were obtained. Example 1 was repeated, operating under the described conditions but with the difference that a total of 80 ml of a toluene methanol mixture of volumetric ratio 7 3 were used instead of methanol alone. 5.4 g of FBP with a specific rotation of 45.9 c 2 DMF were obtained. Example 6 was repeated, operating under the described conditions but with the difference that 110 ml of the toluene methanol mixture were used. 4.8 g of FBP with a specific rotation of 64.3 c 2 DMF were obtained. Example 1 was repeated as far as the crystallisation of the FBP salt, which was filtered off and washed on the filter with methanol. The mother liquors originating from said crystallisation and washing operations, and containing the levorotatory antipode, were acidified by adding 1.4 ml of 96 sulphuric acid, and were kept for 3 hours boiling under reflux. 6 g of potassium hydroxide were added, and the mixture was kept boiling under reflux for 3 hours. After adding 5 ml of water and distilling the methanol, the mixture was acidified with hydrochloric acid, and the organic phase extracted with ethyl acetate. Alternatively, the mixture was acidified with acetic acid, and the FBP acid was recovered by filtration . After concentration the solvent, 5.8 g of an FBP acid with a specific rotation of 5.0 c 2 DMF were recovered, and could be recycled to the first stage without further purification. 6.3 g 0.021 moles of FBP methyl ester with a specific rotation of 36.2 c 2 DMF and obtained from FBP with a specific rotation of 47.3 c 2 DMF ,were treated with 2.7 g of KOH in 60 ml of methanol under reflux for 2 hours. After adding 5 ml of water and then repeating the recovery procedure of Example 8, 5.7 g of FBP acid with a specific rotation of 2.4 c 2 DMF were obtained. 10.0 g 0.035 moles of FBP with a specific rotation of 50.4 c 2 DMF were heated in 85 phosphoric acid for 5 hours at 130 C. 8.9 g of FBP were obtained. 15.0 g of FBP acid having a specific rotation of of 74 DMF were converted to the corresponding N methyl glucamine salt by adding 10.3 g of NMG in 50 ml of methanol. Said salt after crystallization had a melting point of 174 176 C and the following specific rotations c 1 in DMF of 0.2 of 0.0 of 0.1 of 2.2. In the same manner, starting from an FBP acid having a specific rotation of 74.5 DMF , a salt of NMG was prepared which, after crystallization from acetone, had a melting point of 135 137 C and the following specific rotations c 1 in DMF of 27.9 of 29.1 of 32.7 of 53.0.
