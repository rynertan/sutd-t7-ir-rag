# Press for installing fasteners in workpieces.

## Abstract
A machine such as an injection moulding machine or a press for installing fasteners into workpieces has a ram 10 coupled to a hydraulic piston and cylinder 16 via a toggle linkage 22,24 which is movable by a pneumatically control led piston and cylinder 14 between a folded condition and a substantially collinear condition. Such movement of the tog gle 22,24 advances or retracts the ram 10 towards or away from an anvil 18 . The toggle 22,24 can transmit force from the cylinder 16 to the ram 10 only when the toggle 22,24 is in the collinear condition and hence when the ram 10 is in close proximity or contact with the anvil 18 . In this way, the operators hands are safeguarded without the need for the provision of a machine guard.

## Description
DESCRIPTION PRESS FOR INSTALLING FASTEN RS IN WORKPIDCES This invention relates to machines of the kind which comprise a first working member mounted on the mactline for movement towards and away from a second workng member, the frst member being movable axially fran a remote position to a position i.n which it is in close proximity or contact with said second member, and force applying means operable when tExe first member is in close proximity or contact with said stcond member to apply a large force to said first working rember, which force acts axially in a direction towards said second merttjer. The invention is applicable to various machines of this kind, for example injection naulding machines, but is especially applicable to presses for installing fasteners in workpieces, e.g. for inserting self piercing and self clinching rivets into an assembly of netal sheets as described in our prior British Patent No.147146 , to wtich reference should be made for further details. Such presses generally comprise a ram which executes a working stroke while the workpteoe is support i ty an anvil. In over to pennit adequate access to the installation zone of the pres to enable ttle operator to locate t workptece in lesitiorl, that ram must have a fairly long stroke between its fully retracted and fully extended positions. This gives rise to the problem of safeguarding the operators hinds. One solution is to provide a press guard which must be in position before the operator can initiate the working stroke of the ram but such an arrangement tends to recluce the installation speed because the guard must he repeatedly withdrawn and replaced. Another solution involves designing the press so that the ram is of two part construction cmprising a hollow shaft to which a pneumatically displaceable piston is secured and a rod received within the hollow shaft and displaccable therewith under the action of the pneumatic cylinder and piston. The hollow shaft forms a hydraulic cylinder accommodating a piston carried bythe rod and the pneumatic and hydraulic piston and cylinders dre actuated sequentially so that initially the shaft and rod are advanced by the pneumatic piston and cylinder frorn a retracted workpiece loading position to a fastener installing position and, opon reaching the latter position, the rod is advance further by the hydraulic piston and cylinder to execute te installation stroke.Thus, with this arrangement the first stage of the ram travel is under pneumatic pressure and the pressure is design i so that it is insufficient to cause injury to the operator s hands or to drainage an incoreectly located fastener. The second stage can only be initiated when the shaft rod assembly has cmpleted the first stage and at this point the gap between the shaft rod and the anvil or workpiece is designed to be small enough to preclude the possibility of the operators hand or fingers beckoning trapped.The second stage can therefore be execute3 under relatively large hydraulic pressure. This latter solution overcomes tlle drawbacks associated with press guards but is a less econoical solution because of the complex two part design of the ram which entails ne pressure cylinder operating within another wit consequet production expense and difficolties i maintenance and servicing. The present invention seeks to provide an eltenwtive solution to the problem of safeguarding operation of a machine of the kind initially referred to in wrich the draw xcks of the prior art are eliminated or at least minimised. According to one aspect of the present invention a machine of the kind initially referred to is characterisel in that the force applying means is connected to said first member via a toggle linkage whose links are movable from a folded condition to a predetermined substantially oolinear condition such tllat the first member advances towards or retracts from said second member in response to straightening or folding respectively of said links, and in that neans is provided for maintaining said linkage in said predetermined condition to allow transmission of force frail said force applying means to said first member but only when said linkage is in said predetermined condition. Movement of the toggle linkage between its folded and coy linear conditions may be effected manually or by low force applying neans acting on the toggle ltnk ge with a foroe of conskkerabl smaller magnitode than that exerted by said large force applying means. Preferably means are provided for sensing movement of ttle toggle linkage into said predetermined condition and preventing operation of said large forct applying means until the linkage is in said predetermined condition. According to a second aspect of ti C present invention we provide a machine for installing fasteners in workpieces comprising an anvil for location of a workpiece, a rüm displaceable towards the anvil to effect a forwan3 stroke, low force means for dsplacg the ram over a first part of its forward stroke and large force means for displacing the ran over Ule remaining part of its forward stroke, characterised in that the large force means is conected to the ram via a toggle linkuge wtich translates operation of the low force means into displacement of the ram over said first part of its forward stroke until the linkage occupies a predetermined postion n which it is construined against hingng to enable it to transmit force from the lange force means to the ram wher the romatnder of said forward stroke em be competod under the influenoe of said large force means acting through the toggle linkage. In the preferred embodiment the toggle lnkage cmprises a pair of pivotally connected links which are further pivoted to the large force means and the ram respectively and tlle low pressure means is connected to one of said links at a separate point adjacent the pivotal connection between the links, the arrangement being such that, when the low pressure gleans is retracted, the links are in an acute angled relation and, when the low pressure means is extended, the links are in an overcentre, alnost colinear relation and oo operate with an abuttnent surface which maintains them in such relation until the low pressure gleans is retracted. Preferably the links carry at least one roller element wtlich is arranged to bear against said abutment surface when tlle links are in the overcentre relation thereby reducing frictional resistace when the links are displaced longitudinally by the large force means. Conveniently, the low force means comprises a spring loaded element acting on tile toggle linkage to l.ias the SailL towards the overcentre position and a pneumatic cylinder arranged to hold the spring loaded element retracted so that the toggle linkage is unable to transmit force frcxn tite large force means to the ram or first member, user operable means being provided to disable said cylinder to allow extension of the piston rod thereof to take the toggle linkago overcentre and advance the rain over the first part of the forward stroke. Preferably means is providel for sensing movement of or tile toggle linkage to said predetenwined position and autotnatically actuating the large force neans which may tie a hydraulic cylinder whose piston is connected to the rant via tl e toggle linkage. The invention will now be described by way of exaitiple with reference to the accompanying drawngs of which Figures 1 aid 2 respectivel show a rivet installng machine in noperative and operative positions. As shown, the machine comprises a ram or punch 10 guided in a frame 12 for vertical reciprocable movement, under the control of pneumatic cylinder 14 and hydraulic cylinder 16, towards and away from a die 18. The punch 10 is cnnected to the pinton 20 of the cylinder 16 via a toggle linkage cmprising links 22, 24 which are normally folded relative to one another, as shown inFigure 1, to hold the punch in a retracted position to allow the user access to the space between the punch and die for the purpose of locating a workpiece in preparation for a rivetting operation. A supply of rivets are fed one by one frail of for punch a vibratory bowl channe into tite d mecha travel of the punch and suitable guide channels and fecd mechanism not shown are provided t correctly locate the rivets for advence towands and installation into the workpiece by te punch. The lin age is beld in the Figure 1 positon by the retracted piston rod 26 of cylinder 14. The rod 26 is spring loaded link 22 adjacent the pivotal connection 28 and is spring loaded towards an extended position.When the air in cylinder 14 is exhausted, e.g. in response to operation of a fot pedal for effecting a rivetting operation, the spring 30 urges the rod 36 outwardly thereby causing the links to straighten and, in doing so, advance the punch the stroke The arrangetnent is such that this advance portion of the s stroke is ovzletecl when a roller 32 carried by pivot 28 abuts a guide surface 33 and, at this point, the links are slightly overeentre and the punch is in such close proximity to the and ttlat the users fingers cannot this a advance between of the punch and die.It will be noted titan tis advance position of the punch stroke takes place purel under the action of the spring 30 so that if will punch is impeded by the user s band, no injury will result. When the linkage reaches the Figure 2 position, the roller 32 engages a pivoted trip lever 34 which, in turn, operates an actuator 36 of valve 38 to supply hydraulc ol to the cylinder 16 whereb the working portin of the punch stroke is porformod.Because the links 22, 24 are now constrainad to remain in the overcentre postion of Fteure 2, the force developed by the cyltnder 16 can be transmitted to the punch via the linke. During the downward movement of the linkage, it will be seen that the roller 32 runs along the guide surface 33. Upon completion of the working stroke, i.e. installation of the fastener, the above sequence of operations is reversed to return the punch and togqle links back to the Figure 1 position, the cylinder 14 being o operated at a suitabic point in the reverse sequence to fold the linkage back from the overcentre position. Although in the embodument described above, movement of the toggle linkage between the positions of Figures 1 and 2 is effected by means of the spring loaded and pneumatically controlled rod 26, it will be understood that the forces involved in roving the toggle linkage will be relatively small and that the positioning of the toggle linkage could be effected manually if desired.Also it is to be understood that the invention is applicable to other forms of machines, such as injection moulding machines, in which one of the working meters undergoes an initial advancing movement into close proximit or contract with a secnd working member and is then subjected to a large force.
