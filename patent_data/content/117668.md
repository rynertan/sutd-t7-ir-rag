# Firing angle control in inverters.

## Abstract
A multi phase inverter comprising a bridged array of thy ristors 1 12 periodically fired in sequence by a source of firing pulses 19, 20 is provided with a circuit arrangement for con trolling each extinction angle γ of the thyristors individually. Said circuit arrangement comprises means 21 for summing γ signals, means 30 for differencing said sums to generate an error signal E₁ E₅ and means 22 for applying said error signal to said source of firing pulses at appropriate phase an gles to appropriate thyristors so as to tend to equalise said sums, the number of pairs of differenced sums being equal to the number of thyristors in the array. Preferably each error signal acts as constant multiplier of a correction signal which is a harmonic of the A.C. output frequency of the inverter. The arrangement improves the efficiency by enabling each γ to be minimised individually without risk of commutation failure.
