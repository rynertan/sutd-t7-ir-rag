# PROCESS FOR USING SEDIMENTS DEVELOPED DURING STORAGE OF PURE MDI

## Abstract
This invention relates to a process for utilizing the sediments in pure MDI which comprises a heating the sediments at temperatures of 180 C to 250 C for 0.25 hour to 6 hours in the presence of crude MDI and b cooling the product to a temperature of 60 C or less within 5 minutes. The sediment free crude MDI which results can then be used for the preparation of polyurethane products.
