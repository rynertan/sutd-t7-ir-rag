# Production of aromatics from ethane and or ethylene.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a process for producing aromatic hydrocarbons by bringing a feedstock containing at least 10 w w of C₂ hydrocarbons into contact with a catalyst composition comprising a gallium loaded zeolite and a Group VIIB or Group VIII metal compound. The reaction is carried out at a temperature from 500 750 C. A WHSV of 0.2 10 and a pressure of 1 20 bar are preferred. The presence of Group VIIB or Group VIII metal compounds increases conversion of the C₂ feed and reduces formation of undesirable polynuclear aromatics.
