# Means for cooling the faceplate of a cathode ray tube in a television projection system.

## Abstract
For cooling the faceplate of a high energy cathode ray tube in an in line television projection system, a cooling cell 5 constructed as a separate entity is interposed between the CRT faceplate 2 and the transmission lens 3 which is arranged in front of and in line with the cathode ray 1 . The cooling cell comprises two flexible transparent diaphragms 6 and 7 which are conected at their peripheries to form an enclosure 8 for containing a cooling liquid and which are arranged in contact with the front surface 2a of the CRT faceplate and the rear surface 4 of the lens. The cooling cell has an inlet 11 and an outlet 12 through which circulating liquid enters and leaves the cell.
