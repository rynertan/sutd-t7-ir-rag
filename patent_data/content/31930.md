# Accumulative pressure pump.

## Abstract
An improved finger operated dispenser pump is dis closed. The pump is of the accumulative pressure type having an upper chamber and piston and a smaller diameter lower chamber and piston. A flexible dip tube 34 is attached to the stem of the lower piston 31 communicating with the passage therethrough, the dip tube 34 being of a smaller external cross section relative to the opening 61 in the lower chamber bottom and thereby providing a gas passage for priming, and is of a length to move the lowermost part of a container on depression of the piston to provide essentially complete removal of liquid contents of the container.
