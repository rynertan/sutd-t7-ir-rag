# Ultra fine sheath core composite fibers and composite sheets made thereof.

## Abstract
Improved ultrafine sheath core composite fibers and composite sheets composed of these fibers are disclosed. The composite fibers have a fineness of 0.0001 to 0.5 denier and comprise 10 to 70 of core having a very high intrinsic viscosity within a specific range and being located at the center of the sheath and 90 to 30 of sheath composed of a polyester copolymerized with 1.5 to 8 mole , based on the total acid component, of 5 sodium or lithium or potassium sulphoisophthalte and having a thickness of 0.04 to 2 microns. The composite fibers have a high strength and are dyeable with a cationic dye. When the composite fibers are combined with a elastic material such a polyurethane, suede like artificial leathers having excellent softness, touch, feel and colour can be obtained.
