# BRIDGELESS TUNGSTEN HALOGEN LAMP

## Abstract
A single ended, tungsten halogen lamp having a tubular hard glass envelope containing an inert gas and a halogen, preferably bromine, therein. An improved bridgeless support structure is provided in which a wire support is attached to one end of a pair of filament coils. The wire support extends in two directions from the point of attachment and includes two extension portions which are each secured in the press sealed base portion of the envelope to provide a fixed filament support with improved shock resistant capabilities and with reduced possibility of contamination due to eli mination of the bridge element. A method of making the lamp is also described.
