# Ultrasound mammary scanning apparatus.

## Abstract
Ultrasound breast scanning and diagnosis is achieved by suspending the breast in a water pool, in which is immersed a wide aperture transducer lens assembly. The water path is defined by two separate segments, an upper one, into which the breast is suspended, contained by a flexible sonically transparent bag member, and the lower being contained in a longitudinally movable tank which is filled to contact with the bag member portion protruding into the tank.
