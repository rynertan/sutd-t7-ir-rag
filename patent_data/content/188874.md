# FUEL TANK HEATING SYSTEMS

## Abstract
Several embodiments of fuel tank heating systems are described which are particularly adapted to be removably in stalled within fuel oil drums and which warm the interior con tents of the drum enabling the fuel to be conveniently with drawn in conditions where they are exposed to cold ambient temperatures leading to fuel waxing and solidification. Accord ing to one embodiment of the invention, a combustion type heating device is installed within a port of the drum which uses fuel from the drum to support a flame. Heat transfer units con duct heat from the flame into the drum, thereby warming the in terior contents. According to a second embodiment of this in vention, a fuel outlet conduit is positioned within the fuel drum and is preferably in close proximity with heating units, thereby enabling fuel to be withdrawn from the interior contents of the drum. Further, a fuel pump may be submersed within the tank and connected to the fuel outlet conduit. Each of the systems described may be conveniently installed within drain ports of fuel oil drums of conventional configuration.
