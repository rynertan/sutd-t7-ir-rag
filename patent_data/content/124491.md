# Seed drill with a tip up hopper on a longitudinal, horizontal axis.

## Abstract
The instant invention relates to a seed drill fitted with a tip up seed hopper which rotates around a horizontal axis in such a way that the seed outlets are always facing upwards during the mixing stage and or until the actual sowing be gins. The seed drill is characterised by a feedbox with a semi circular bottom, having a longitudinal raised chamber si tuated externally to the longitudinal hinge of its lid. Said chamber is as long as the hopper itself and connected to its semi circular bottom by an inclined plane. The exteynal wall of said raised chamber is provided with equidistant outlets, each with a distribution device and a regulator valve and stop.

## Claims
Claims 1 Seed drill with a tip up.hopper on a longitudinal, horizontal axis, characterised by a feedbox with a semi circular bottom, having a longs tudinal raised chamber situated externally to the longitudinal hinge of its lid. Said chamber is as long as the hopper itself and connected to its semi circular bottom by an inclined plane. The external wall of said raised chamber is provided with equidistant outlets, each with a distribution device and a regulator valve and stop. 2 Seed drill with tip up hopper on a longitudinal horizontal axis as claimed in claim 1 , characterised by a hopper which may be tipped by means of an appropriate control around a horizontal longitudinal shaft so that the outlets can move downwards until they stop exactly above the mouth of the corresponding feed pipe, fixed to the supporting frame. 3 Seed drill with a tip up seed hopper on a longitudinal, horizontal axis, characterised by a shaft around which the hopper may be tipped, which acts also as a churning device in that it is provided with radial arms fitted with pallets or spatulas.

## Description
Seed drill with a tip up hopper on a longitudinal, horizontal axis.This application for Industrial Patent has for its object a seed drill fitted with a tip up seed hopper which rotates around a horizontal axis in such a way that the seed outlets are always facing upwards during the mixing stage and or until the actual sowing begins.The most common types of seed drill usually consist of a hopper or feedbox for the seed on the bottom of which is fitted a distribution device which removes the seed and discharges it through suitable openings into feed pipes, the ends of which are equipped with shares or coulters for making the furrows as seed coverers are also provided. Furthermore, the hopper is made of galvanised iron plate which is painted and is closed at the top by a tip up lid.Provided near the seed outlets are one or two churning devices consisting of longitudinally rotating shafts fitted with radial spokes or pallets.The distribution devices which may be of the free kind, for example, with buckets or shovels, or of the forced kind, for example, with rollers bearing grooves, teeth or pallets, are placed at regular intervals along the entire length of the hopper, their number depending upon the size of the machine and the spacing of the furrows. At the top of each distributor there is an outlet above which is situated the mouth of the feed pipe ending in the respective coulter.It often occurs that seed is put into the hopper along with fertilisers, fungicides or other agricultural products which must be evenly mixed with the seed before starting to sow3 this mixing action is generally carried out by the aforesaid churners. The types of seed drills which have been described here inevitably lose a certain amount of the product introduced from the bottom of the hopper, despite being provided with regulator valves and stops which close off each outlet. The finer the added product is, the greater the loss. This gives rise to very serious problems when the added product is in liquid form, in fact it is virtually impossible to carrv out the pre sowing mixing phase in that most of the liquid product drips out through the outlets and is lost.The fact that the mixing takes place near and above the outlets often leads to an accumulation of the product in the tubes and consequently to a partial blockage or even a complete obstruction of the tubes themselves.The aim of the herein described invention is to provide a solution to these problems with a seed hopper on a horizontal longitudinal axis so that during the mixing the outlets are facing upwards towards the lid.These outlets may then move downwards to a position above their respe ctive seed pipes when sowing takes place, following the tipping of the hopper.The accompanying drawings are for a clearer illustration of the herein described invention wherein fig 1 is a section with a transversal plane corresponding to an outlet of the seed drill hopper in accordance with the instant invention, illustrated schematically during the mixing or discharging phases fig. 2 is a section with a transversal plane corresponding to an outlet of the seed drill hopper in accordance with the instant invention, illustrated schematically during sowing.With reference to the aforesaid figures the seed drill, in accordance with the instant invention, is characterised by a seed hopper 1 with a semi circular bottom, closed on top by a tip up lid 3 , hinged along a longitudinal axis 3a .Near the hinged axis of the lid 3 the feedbox 1 has a raised longs tudinal chamber 4 , as long as the hopper itself, the side of which is provided with equidistant seed outlets 5 each with a distribution device 6 and a regulator valve and stop 8 . The semi circular bottom of the hopper i is connected to the raised chamber 4 by an inclined plane 14 which aids the flow of the product downwards towards the outlets 5 during sowing.The hopper i can be tipped by means of an appropriate control around a longitudinal horizontal shaft 9 , so that the outlets 5 can move downwards until they stop exactly above the mouth 12 of the correspon ding feed pipe 13 fixed to the supporting frame 15 . see fig. 2 .The aforesaid longitudinal shaft 9 also acts as a churning device in that it is provided with radial arms 10 fitted with pallets or spatulas 11
