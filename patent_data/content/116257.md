# Process for preparing 4 amino 5 hexenoic acid.

## Abstract
4 Amino 5 hexenoic acid is prepared by a reacting 5 oxo 2 pyrrolidine acetonitrile with hyd rogen and dimethylamine in the presence of a palladium catalyst to form N,N dimethyl 2 5 oxo 2 pyrrolidine ethylamine b oxidizing N,N dimethyl 2 5 oxo 2 pyrrolidine ethylamine to produce the corresponding N oxide deriva tive c pyrolysis of the N oxide derivative to form 5 vinyl 2 pyrrolidinone optionally, separating, N,N dimethyl 2 5 oxo 2 pyrrolidine ethylamine by product from the 5 vinyl 2 pyrrolidinone product and d hydrolyzing 5 vinyl 2 pyrrolidinone to form 4 amino 5 hexenoic acid.
