# Production of formable thin steel sheet excellent in ridging resistance.

## Abstract
A process for producing a formable thin steel sheet excel lent in ridging resistance. Said process comprises finishing a low carbon steel at a strain rate of not less than 300 s ยน in a temperature range of 800 to 300 C in at least one pass when the low carbon steel is rolled into a specified thickness, and subsequently performing recrystallization annealing.
