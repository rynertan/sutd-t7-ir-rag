# Production of a directed spray by atomising molten metal.

## Abstract
For uniformly coating a substrate 30 with a spray, a stream 1 of liquid falls past a point towards which five nozzles 21 in a bank 20 are all directed but at different angles. The bank 20 and a second bank 20 not shown flank the stream 1. Bursts of atomising gas are fired through the respective nozzles in a repeated sequence, such as to cause a repeated sequence of five equal durations of spray in the five directions shown in dotted lines in turn.
