# Antibiotics produced by Kibdelosporangium aridum Shearer gen. nov., sp. nov. ATCC 39323.

## Abstract
A novel antibiotic complex of vancomycin like antibio tics, AAD 216 complex, is produced by the cultivation of a fermentation broth containing Kibdelosporangium aridum Shearer gen. nov., sp. nov. ATCC 39323 microorganisms in an aqueous nutrient medium under submerged aerobic condi tions. The AAD 216 complex and its major bioactive compo nents AAD 216A, AAD 216B, and AAD 216C exhibit antibiotic activity and growth promotant activity.
