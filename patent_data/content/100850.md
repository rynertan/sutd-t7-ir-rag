# Compacted amorphous ribbon.

## Abstract
This invention relates to the production of large shapes of metallic glass fabricated from ribbon. The inventive method contemplates placing the ribbon and consolidating the alloy under a pressure or at least 1000 psi at a temperatures of between 70 and 90 of the crystallization temperature for a time sufficient to facilitate bonding of the ribbons.
