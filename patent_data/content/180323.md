# Apparatus for aligning a machine tool saddle.

## Abstract
There is disclosed apparatus for aligning a machine tool saddle 16 for movement along an axis of travel includes a pair of ways 18, 20 rigidly joined to a support structure 22 in parallel relation with the axis of travel, each of the ways 18, 20 being in slideable engagement with a slot 34, 36 formed in the saddle 16 . Each of the ways is provided with a face 38, 40 selectively angled to lie on one of the legs of an imaginary V 41 positioned so as to be bisected by a plane 42 parallel to the ways 18, 20 and positioned midway between them. A number of keeper blocks 52, 58 are inserted between the saddle 16 and each of the angled way faces 38, 40 each of the keeper blocks having an angled face 64, 66 in closely spaced parallel relation with one of the angled way faces 38, 40 . Devices 67, 108 are positioned between the angled faces 64, 66 of the keepers 52, 58 and their respective closely spaced angled way faces 38, 40 to transmit forces between the ways 18, 20 and the saddle 16 through the keeper blocks 52, 58 to maintain the saddle 16 in alignment with the axis of travel as the saddle 16 is selectively moved and positioned along the axis. The devices may be adjustable to selectively space the angled faces of the keeper blocks from the angled way faces.
