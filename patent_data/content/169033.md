The invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions which comprise a compound of the formula A or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The invention further provides The compounds of formula A can be prepared by standard methods. Typical methods are now discussed. The compounds of the invention having formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be prepared by reacting a compound having formula X or XA with a compound having formula XI, A compound of formula I wherein one symbol W is sulfur can be prepared by reaction of a compound of formula I where each W is oxygen with one equivalent of a compound of formula XI wherein W is sulfur to thereby displace either the W X R² or the W X R³ substituent. For purposes of this procedure, the W X R² and W X R³ substituents of starting compound I should ideally be identical. This procedure is conveniently carried out using an acid catalyst such as boron trifluoride. Compounds having structural formula I wherein at least one symbol W is sulfur may be oxidized to the corresponding sulfoxide or sulfone by known procedures. Compounds having formula II may be prepared from a compound having formula XII, wherein T, U, V, Y and R³ are as defined above Compounds having formula II wherein W is sulfur may be prepared by first converting the hydroxyl substituent of compound XII to a more readily displaceable substituent such as a hydrocarbon sulfonate ester, e.g. the methane sulfonate ester, XIII, The conversion of XII to XIII may be carried out by treating XII with methanesulfonyl chloride under standard conditions. Compound XIII may then be treated Compounds having formula II wherein W is oxygen may be prepared from compound XIII in a similar manner by Compounds having formula III may be prepared by reacting an anion derived from a compound having formula XVII In the above described reactions certain substituents may have to be protected in order to avoid unwanted side reactions. Thus in particular the R² and R³ substituents may be protected by methods recognized in the art, especially for example by etherification. In addition, the groups R² and R³ in a compound of formula A may be modified, if desired, by known procedures. Thus, for example, a compound wherein R² or R³ is CH₂OH may be converted to a compound wherein R² or R³ is CO₂H by oxidation or to a compound wherein R² or R³ is CH₂OCOCH₃ by acylation. For purposes of completeness, the following abbreviated reaction sequence is given to exemplify a process for performing selective reactions where multiple sites of unsaturation are present. Other such sequences are known in the art. In the above abbreviated reaction sequence, THP indicates the 2 tetrahydro 2H pyranyl radical. Double bonds can be regiospecifically included or excluded by proper choice of carbon to carbon bond forming reactions and reagents which will be known to those skilled in the art. The above described starting materials are either known compounds or preparable from known compounds by methods known in the art. Thus, compound X is an acetal or ketal, preparable from the corresponding aldehyde or ketone by well known methods. In an alternative method, a compound such as XX may be reacted with an orthoester such as ethyl orthoformate by known methods to produce the acetal XXI Compounds having formula XII are secondary alcohols which may be prepared, for example, by the reaction of a Grignard reagent such as XXII with an aldehyde such as XXIII Salts of compounds of the invention with inorganic or organic bases can be prepared for example by reaction with sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, ammonia and amines. These salts may be converted back to their respective acids by treatment with an acid such as dilute hydrochloric acid. The acids and their respective salts differ in certain physical properties such as solubility but are otherwise equivalent for purposes of the invention. Salts of compounds of the invention with organic or inorganic acids can be prepared by contacting the free base with a sufficient amount of the desired acid to produce a salt in the conventional manner. The free base may be regenerated by treating the salt with a base, for example, dilute aqueous base such as sodium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, ammonia, and sodium bicarbonate solutions. The free bases differ from their respective salts somewhat in certain physical properties such as solubility, but the salts are otherwise equivalent to their respective free bases for purposes of the invention. The compounds of the invention may exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms, including hydrated forms. In general, these solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water or ethanol are equivalent to the unsolvated forms for purposes of the invention. Certain compounds of the invention may exist in isomeric forms. The invention includes all such isomers both in pure form and in admixture, including racemic mixtures. The compounds of this invention can be used to treat allergy caused diseases and psoriasis, but their preferred use is for treating allergic chronic obstructive lung diseases. In chronic obstructive lung disease, as used herein, the passage of air through the lungs is obstructed or diminished as in asthma, bronchitis and the like. The anti allergy effects of the compounds of this invention may be identified by tests which measure a compound s inhibition of leukotriene C₄ induced contraction of lung smooth muscle. The substance leukotriene C₄ is a component of slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis SRS A . For example, the compound hexanoic acid, 6,6 2 pentadecynylidene bis oxy bis , was found to inhibit leukotriene C₄ induced contractions of lung smooth muscle in such a test procedure A guinea pig is killed and the lung is removed the trachea, bronchi and large blood vessels are discarded. Strips of lung parenchyma are prepared from the lower lobes of the lung. The strips are suspended in a heated organ bath containing 10 ml of oxygenated Tyrodes solution. Isometric tension is measured. A contractile response to 10 ⁸ Molar leukotriene C₄ is generated in the absence and presence of test compound and the percent inhibition produced by the test compound is calculated. Fasted male guinea pigs are anesthetized with dialurethane i.p. 0.9 ml kg of a solution containing diallylbarbituric acid 0.1 g ml, ethylurea 0.4 g ml and ethyl carbamate 0.4 g ml and prepared for the measurement of intratracheal pressure as modified from H. Konzett and R. Rossler, Nauyn Schmeidebergs Arch. Exp. Path. Pharmakol. When administered orally the compounds of the invention are active at doses from about 10 to 500 mg kg of body weight when administered parenterally, e.g., intravenously, the compounds are active at dosages from about 0.1 to 10 mg kg body weight when administered by inhalation aerosol or nebulizer the compounds are active at dosages of about 0.1 to 5 mg per puff, and one to four puffs may be taken every 4 hours. The compounds of this invention are also useful for the treatment of inflammation. The anti inflammatory use of the compounds of the present invention may be demonstrated by the Reversed Passive Arthus Reaction RPAR Synovitis technique as set forth below using male Lewis rats obtained from Charles River Breeding Laboratories weighing 200 250 grams. The potency of the compounds is determined using indomethacin as the standard. On the basis of the test results, an oral dosage range of about 10 mg kg day to about 500 mg kg day in divided doses taken at about 4 hour intervals is recommended. A Lewis rat is dosed orally with drug or placebo one hour prior to intravenous administration of 2.28 mg of bovine serum albumin BSA in 0.2 cc of pyrogen free saline followed by the intra articular injection of 0.54 mg of rabbit anti BSA antibody in 0.03 cc of pyrogen free saline into one knee joint. The other knee is injected with 0.03 cc of pyrogen free saline. All injections are made with the animal under light ether anesthesia. Three hours later the rat is again dosed orally with drug or placebo. All drug doses are split. That is, one half of the dose is administered before lesion induction and one half is administered after lesion induction. The following morning about 17 hours after lesion induction the rat is killed and both knee joints are exposed. The subpatellar areolar tissue with attendant synovium is excised and weighed. Differences between the weight of antibody and saline injected knees are considered to represent the inflammatory response for each animal delta synovial weight . Differences in delta synovial weight between lesion controls and drug treated rats are evaluated for statistical significance with an analysis of variance. Relative potencies are determined with a linear regression analysis. For preparing pharmaceutical compositions from the compounds described by this invention, inert, pharma ceutically acceptable carriers can be either solid or liquid. Solid form preparations include powders, tablets, dispersible granules, capsules, cachets and suppositories. A solid carrier can be one or more substances which may also act as diluents, flavoring agents, solubilizers, lubricants, suspending agents, binders or tablet disintegrating agents it can also be an encapsulating material. In powders, the carrier is a finely divided solid which is in admixture with the finely divided active compound. In the tablet the active compound is mixed with carrier having the necessary binding properties in suitable proportions and compacted into the shape and size desired. The powders and tablets preferably contain from 5 or 10 to about 70 percent of the active ingredient. Suitable solid carriers are magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar, lactose, pectin, dextrin, starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, a low melting wax, cocoa butter and the like. The term per paration is intended to include the formulation of the active compound with encapsulating material as carrier providing a capsule in which the active component with or without other carriers is surrounded by carrier, which is thus in association with it. Similarly, cachets are included. Tablets, powders, cachets and capsules can be used as solid dosage forms suitable for oral administration. For preparing suppositories, a low melting wax such as a mixture of fatty acid glycerides or cocoa butter is first melted, and the active ingredient is dispersed homogeneously therein as by stirring. The molten homogeneous mixture is then poured into convenient sized molds and allowed to cool and thereby solidify. Liquid form preparations include solutions, suspensions and emulsions. As an example may be mentioned water or water propylene glycol solutions for parenteral injection. Liquid preparations can also be formulated in solution in aqueous polyethylene glycol solution. Aqueous solutions suitable for oral use can be prepared by adding the active component in water and adding suitable flavors and coloring, stabilizing, sweetening, solubilizing and thickening agents as desired. Aqueous suspensions suitable for oral use can be made by dispersing the finely divided active component in water with viscous material, i.e., natural or synthetic gums, resins, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose and other well known suspending agents. Also included are solid form preparations which are intended for conversion, shortly before use, into liquid form preparations for either oral or parenteral administration. Such liquid forms include solutions, suspensions and emulsions. These particular solid form preparations are most conveniently provided in unit dose form and as such are used to provide a single liquid dosage unit. Alternately, sufficient solid may be provided so that after conversion to liquid form, multiple individual liquid doses may be obtained by measuring predetermined volumes of the liquid form pre paration as with a syringe, teaspoon or other volumetric container. When multiple liquid doses are so prepared, it is preferred to maintain the unused portion of said liquid doses at low temperature i.e., under refrigera tion in order to retard possible decomposition. The solid form preparations intended for conversion into liquid form may contain, in addition to the active material, flavorings, colorings, stabilizers, buffers, thickeners, artificial and natural sweeteners, dispersing and solubilizing agents and the like. The solvent utilized for preparing the liquid form preparation may be water, isotonic water, ethanol, glycerine, propylene glycol and the like as well as mixtures thereof. Naturally, the solvent utilized will be chosen with regard to the route of administration for example, liquid preparations containing large amounts of ethanol are not suitable for parenteral use. Preferably, the pharmaceutical preparation is in unit dosage form. In such form, the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing discrete quantities of preparation, for example, packeted tablets, capsules and powders in vials or ampoules. The unit dosage form can also be a capsule, cachet or tablet itself or it can be the appropriate number of any of these in packaged form. The quantity of active compound in a unit dose of preparation may be varied or adjusted from 1 mg to 100 mg according to the particular application and the potency of the active ingredient. The compositions can, if desired, also contain other therapeutic agents. The dosages may be varied depending upon the requirements of the patient, the severity of the condition being treated and the particular compound being employed. Determination of the proper dosage for a particular situation is within the skill of the art. Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller dosages which are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect under the circumstances is reached. For convenience, the total daily dosage may be divided and administered in portions during the day if desired.
