## Description
BLENDS OF THERMOPLASTIC POLYURETHANE ELASTOMERS AND ACETALRESINS AND ARTICLES BLOlTMOLDED THEREFROWI Thermoplastic polyurethane elastomers are wellknown. They are essentially the 1 1 reaction products of polymeric diols, optionally together with one or more monomeric diols, and aromatic diisocyanates. The polymers generally exhibit outstanding physical properties however, in blow molding applications they lack sufficient melt strength at normal blow molding processing temperatures. For instance, when one attempts to process thermoplastic polyurethanes by blow molding the hollow segment of extrudate which is to be blown also known as a parison , instead of hanging from the nozzle, often drops off before blowing can be effected.When attempts are made to blow film, the polymer tends to fold back on the surface of the extrusion die. The properties and, therefore, the utility of physical blends of polymers are strongly dependent on the degree of compatibility of the components. A very small number of amorphous polymer pairs are thermodynamically compatible, i.e., truly soluble in each other. Blends which display an intermediate degree of compatibility, i.e., between incompatible and completely or thermodynamically compatible, also are known to exist. These systems are called mechanically compatible or semi compatible. Examples include a blend of a butadiene acrylonitrile copolymer and a styrene acrylonitrile copolymer known as ABS resin and a blend of polystyrene and SBR rubber known as impact polystyrene .These blends are essentially identical to the incompatible blends in their thermal behavior, i.e., they display two major glass trasit ion temperatures Tg . However, their morphology is finer and they are more translucent. They display a higher degree of interphase adhesion, which is reflected in improved mechanical properties, e,g., melt strength, see Noshay andMcGrath, Block Copolymers Overview and Critical Survey,Acedemic Press, N. Y. 1977, pages 1 10. In accordance with the present invention, it has been discovered that blends of. from about 80 98 , preferably about 80 958 of a thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer and from about 2 to 20 percent by weight, preferably about 5 to 12 percent by weight, of a polyformaldehyde or an acetal resin of the formulaEMI2.1 m wherein m n 0.05 0.2, are readily blow molded at conventiona l processing temperatures. The acetal resins of Formula I are copolymers of a minor amount of ethylene oxide and a major amount of formaldehyde. The Thermoplastic Polyurethane Elastomers The thermoplastic polyurethane elastomers which are useful in making the blow moldable blends of the invention .comprise the reaction products of about one molar proportion of a polymeric glycol, preferably having a molecular weight of from about 400 to 3000, optionally from about 1 to 10 molar proportions of one or more low molecular weight aliphatic diols, preferably saturated, and an aromatic diisocyanate in an amount sufficient to react with essentially all of the hydroxyl groups of the polymeric glycol and the optional aliphatic diols, i.e., the ratio of total isocyanate groups NCO to the total hydroxyl groups OH ranging from about 0.95 to about 1 1. The polymeric glycols which are useful in making the thermoplastic polyurethanes include hydroxyl terminated aliphatic polyesters, derived in known manner from the condensation of an aliphatic dicarboxylic acid, e.g., adipic acid, with a stoichiometric excess of one or more saturated aliphatic diols, e.g,, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, 1,4butanediol, and the like aliphatic polyethers, such as poly tetramethylene ether glycol, polypropylene ether glycol, poly ethylene propylene ether glycol, and the like and polythioethers, derived by the self condensation of thiodiethanol or the co condensation of a major proportion of thiodiethanol with a minor proportion of one or more saturated aliphatic diols under the influence of an acidic catalyst, e.g., phosphorous acid.The term aliphatic diol, 1, as it is used herein, includes dihydroxyalkylated derivatives of difunctional phenols, such as the bis hydroxyethyl ether of hydroquinone. The aromatic diisocyanates which are useful in preparing the thermoplastic polyurethanes include, but are notlimited to, the most commonly used aromatic disiocyanates, viz. 2,4 and 2,6 tolylene diisocyanate and isomeric mixtures thereof , known as TDI, and methylenebis 4 phenyl isocyanate , known as MDI. The preferred aromatic diisocyanate is methy lenebis 4 phenlisocyanate . The thermoplastic polyurethane elastomers are oftentimes prepared in the presence of a catalyst, e.g., stannous octoate. Other catalysts are known in the art The polymers are well known and have been used commercially for some time.They are described, among other places, in Bruins, Polyurethane Technology, Interscience Publishers, pages 198 200, and in Modern Plastics Encyclopedia, Vol. 52, No. 10A, 1975 page 84. The Acetal Resins The acetal resins useful in making the blends of the present invention are paraformaldehydes or compounds of the above, fornula I which may be prepared as described by Dermerand Durr in J. Am. Chew. Soc. 76, 912 913 1954 , and Graham in U.S. Patent 2,394,910 hereby incorporated herein by reference. The preferred acetal resins are homopolymers of formaldehyde and copolymers of ethylene oxide and a source of formaldehyde such as formaldehyde per se, s trioxane and the like. The general subject of acetal resins is discussed by Bevington in Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Technology, Volume l, pages 609 628. Preparation of the blends The thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer and the acetal resin, optionally along with other conventional additives such as stabilizers, colorants, carbon black and other fillers, and the like, may be mixed in conventional manner using conventional mixing and blending equipment, such as 1. A single screw extruder with a mixing die or mixing torpedo at 380 to 4200F for 1 to 3 minutes. 2. A twin screw continuous mixer extruder at 350 to 4200F for 1 to 2 minutes in the mixer be fore extrusion. 3. A standard injection molding machine at 390 to 430 OF for 1 to 3 minutes. The mixed blends are then granulated or pelletized and dried in any convenient manner e.g. at 100 to 1200C for 2 to 3 hours or to a moisture content of less than about 0.06 . Blow Nolding of the Blends The blow molding art is well known see for exampleModern Plastics Encyclopedia, Vol. 52, No. 10A, October, 1975, pages 246 255, inclusive. Typically, dried pellets or granules of the resin are fed into an extruder, in which they are melted by application of heat and shear, and the melt is forced through a suitable cored die to form a hollow tube of nearly molten resin, known as a parison. In so called extrusion blow molding, this parison is then grasped by a mold which closes over it, and Åa gas, usually compressed air, is injected into the cavity of the parison, causing the latter to expand against the walls of the mold. The hollow article thus made is then allowed to cool sufficiently so that it can be ejected from the mold without thereby being irreversibly deformed. In injection blow molding, the paxison is injected into a closed mold, which is normally transferred to another station where the parison is blown against the walls of the mold to produce the finished shape of the resinous plastic or elastomeric particle0 In the examples described below, the machine used was of Uhe extrusion blow molding type. The results obtainable with injection blow molding are comparable. The following examples are set forth for purposes of illustration only and are not to be construed as limitations on the present invention except as set forth in the appended claims. All parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise specified. EXAMPLES A, B and CPreparation of Polythioether Based Polyurethane ShermoplÅastic A A mixture of 333 parts of a hydroxyl terminated polythioether, based on thiodiethanol, having a hydroxyl number of about 56 number average molecular weight about 2000 and 60 parts of 1,4 butanediol is stirred under nitrogen at about 1000C. Then, 3.5 parts of a processing wax, 2.1 parts of an antioxidant and 0.06 par of adipoyl chloride are added. Methylenebis 4 phenylisocyanate , 212 parts, is then added and rapidly stirred into solution.When all of the diisocyanate is disolved, 0.07 part of stannous octoate catalyst is added and the viscous reaction mixture is rapidly transferred to a stick resistant glass tray and cured in an oven at 14 00C for about 2 hours. The cured elastomer is granulated and dried. Polyurethane thermoplastics are similarly prepared using B a hydroxyl terminated polyethylene adipate and C a hydroxyl terminated polytetra,methylene.ether glycol instead of the poiythioether, except that the catalyst is not required for the polyether and adipoyl chloride is omitted in using the polyester.
