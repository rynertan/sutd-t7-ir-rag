## Description
Composition of PPE, HIPS and Styrene Butadiene Caprolactone Terpolymer BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The polyphenylene ether also known as polyphenylene oxide resins are a well known family of engnneer ing plastics capable of being extruded, molded or otherwise shaped into articles of various shapes and sizes. A number of these resins and methods for their preparation are disclosed by Allan Hay in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,306, 874 and 3,306,875, and by Gelu Stamatoff in U.S. Patent Nos.3,257,357 and 3,257,358. It is known from Cizek, U.S. Patent No. 3,383,435, and elsewhere, that polyphenylene ethers are admixable with polystyrene to form blends having good properties. It is well known that block copolymers of styrene and butadiene in particular can be used as additives to significantly increase the impact resistance of polyphenvlene ether polystyrene. An undesirable result, however, is that the melt viscosity of the resultant composite is also increased which makes processing into the molded article more difficult. INTRODUCTION TO THE INVENTION The discovery has now been made that a block copolymer of styrene, butadiene and caprolactone, a polar material, can effectively improve the impact resistance of blends comprising polyphenylene ether resin and rubber modified high impact polystyrene, without resulting in prohibitively large increases in the melt viscosity of the resultant composition. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The polyphenylene ether oxide resins useful in accordance with the present compositions are well known and readily available. The preferred polyphenylene ethers are homoand copolymers of the formula EMI3.1 wherein Q, Q , Q and Q , are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, hydrocarbon radicals, halohydrocarbon radicals having at least two carbon atoms between the halogen atom and the phenol nucleus, hydrocarbonoxy radicals and halohydrocarbonoxy radicals having at least two carbon atoms between the halogen atoms and the phenol nucleus, and Q , 0 and 0 in addition may be halogen with the proviso that 0 and 0 are preferably free of a tertiary carbon atom and n represents the total numer of monomer residues and is an integer of at least 50. Especially preferred is poly 2,6 dimethyl l,4 phenylene ether. As previously stated, the compositions of the invention also contain a rubber modified high impact polystyrene. The term rubber modified high impact polystyrene is used throughout this disclosure in its conventional sense to refer to a recognized family of well known materials. An example is Amoco s A6H6 grade of HIPS. Although widely variant proportions of polyphenylene ether and polystyrene are known, the present kinds of compositions preferably contain these ingredients in amounts of from 4 1 to 1 4 of polyphenylene ether rubber modified high impact polystyrene. Special mention is made here of rubber modified high impact polystyrene containing rubber particles which are relatively small in size. Materials of this type are disclosed, for instance, in U.S. Patent No.4,128,602 to Katchman and Lee, Jr. The compositions will also include as an impact modifier a block terpolymer of styrene, butadiene and caprolactone, obtained from Phillips Petroleum Company.These terpolymers can be prepared by following known procedures. The amount of this material in the compositions is not critical and can vary widely. Preferred are amounts in the range 5 to45 parts, based on the weight of the resins. However, best results are usually achieved using from 10 to 30, and especially from 15 to 25 parts, based on the total weight of the combined resinous ingredients. Other ingredients can also be present. These are typically non resinous additives or agents which are customarily present in polyphenylene ether resin molding compositions to improve certain other physical and chemical properties. Such additives include, by way of illustration, flame retardants, drip retardants, strengthening fibers such as glass filaments and graphitewhiskers , mineral fillers reinforcements, dyes, pigments, plasticizers, antioxidants, and processing aids. The supplementary non resinous agents are usually added in minor, but effective, amounts ranging from 1 to 50 based on the total composition. The compositions can be prepared by any one of a number of procedures. In one procedure the components are dry blended, as in a blender or mechanical stirrer, the blend is fed through a single or twin screw extruder, the extrudate is ground, cut or chopped into pieces of the desired size which are then molded on an injection device. The invention is further illustrated in the following examples. These are intended as preferred embodiments which are not to be construed as limiting.Amounts are in parts by weight unless otherwise specified. EXAMPLES 1 9 Compositions in accordance with the invention were prepared comprising poly 2,6 dimethyl 1,4 phenylene ether resin PP,General Electric Co.,intrinsic viscosity 0.49 dl g measured in chloroform at 30 C. , rubber modified high impact polystyrene Amoco s A6H6 grade of small rubber particle HIPS , and a polar block terpolymer of styrene, butadiene and caprolactone Phillips Petroleum in the amounts noted below. The ingredients were pre blended, then extruded on a Werner Pfleiderer 28 mm twin screw extruder set at 550OF. and vented to a vacuum equivalent to 10 inches of mercury. Molding for compositions 1,2, 3, 4 and 5 was accomplished using a 4 oz. Newbury injection molding machine, 5400F. barrel temperature and 2400F. moid temperature. Compositions 6, 7, 8 and 9 were molded on the same machine using a barrel temperature of 5600F. and a mold temperature of 2400F. For comparison purposes, corresponding compositions were prepared using a radial block copolymer of styrene and butadiene Phillips Petroleum s Solprene 411 in place of the polar terpolymer of styrene, butadiene and caprolactone. These were molded under the same conditions. The test results are set forth in the Table below.
