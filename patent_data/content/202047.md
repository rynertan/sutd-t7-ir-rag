The second of the two preferred groups of compounds of Formula 1 are the 4 S stereoisomers and have the formulaEMI13.1 wherein R1, R21 R3 and R4 are as described above for the Formula. A more preferred group of the 4 S stereoisomers occurs when R1 and R2 are each hydrogen, and especially so when either Ra or R4 is hydrogen and the other is an amino protecting group.Examples of this latter group of compounds include 4 S t butoxycarbonylamino 3 oxo 1 methylene l, 2 pyrazolidinium ylide 4 S allyloxycarbonylamino 3 oxo 1 methylene 1 , 2 pyrazolidinium ylide 4 S trimethylsilylamino 3 oxo 1methylene 1, 2 pyrazolidinium ylide 4 S benzyloxycarbonylamino 3 oxo 1methylene 1,2 pyrazolidinium ylide 4 S tritylamino 3 oxo 1 methylene 1,2pyrazolidinium ylide 4 S 2,2,2 trichloroethoxycarbonylamino 3 oxo l methylene 1, 2 pyrazolidinium ylide 4 S 2 trimethylsily ethyloxycarbonyl 3 oxo 1 methylene 1,2 pyrazolidinium ylide 4 S trichloroacetylamino 3 oxo 1 methylene 1 , 2 pyrazolidinium ylide 4 S bromoacetylamino 3 oxo 1 methylene1,2 pyrazolidinium ylide and 4 S 2 nitrobenzylsulfenamido 3 oxo 1 methylene 1, 2 pyrazolidinium ylide.

One synthesis of pyrazolidinium ylide compounds of the instant invention is depicted below in Scheme 1.The products in the synthesis of the Scheme are mixtures of 4 R and 4 S stereoisomers. Scheme 1EMI16.1 protected serlne tosyl serine diazolidine ylide The above Scheme depicts the synthesis of a 4 R, S t butoxycarbonylamino ylide. Ylide starting materials with different amino protecting groups are obtained from serine derivatized with a protecting group other than t butoxycarbonyl. The first step in the synthesis of the ylide compounds, represented by Reaction 1 in the aboveScheme, is the tosylation of the hydroxy group of the protected serine derivative. The tosylation is carried out in methylene chloride with p toluenesulfonyl chloride in the presence of a catalytic amount of 4 dimethylaminopyridine and greater than one equivalent of pyridine. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature overnight. The tosylated serine obtained is cyclized to give the diazolidine. The cyclization represented byReaction 2 is carried out by adding the tosyl serine to a solution of 97 hydrazine in methylene chloride under nitrogen. The mixture is then stirred at room temperature for five hours. The final reaction in the synthesis of the stereoisomeric mixture of pyrazolidinium ylide intermediates comprises the condensation of a ketone or an aldehyde with a diazolidine to give the pyrazolidinium ylide. As a useful alternative procedure, the ketal of the ketone may be condensed with the diazolidine in the presence of an acid. For example, the diazolidine reagent is combined with acetone dimethyl acetal in methanol and then the solution is treated with d 10 camphorsulfonic acid. The mixture is refluxed for 1.5 hours to give the dimethyl ylide i.e., R1 and R2 are methyl . The unsubstituted ylide when R1 and R2 are hydrogen is synthesized by combining the diazolidine reagent and 37 aqueous formaldehyde in methanol and stirring the mixture for twenty minutes at room temperature.Other ketal, thioketal, acetal or thioacetal derivatives of the carbonyl reactants described above can be similarly utilized. When R1 and R2 are different, those skilled in the art will recognize that this final reaction will produce a mixture of E and Z isomers. The synthesis of the above diazolidine starting materials are further described by L.N. Jungheim and R.E. Holmes in European Patent Application No., reference X 6711A field this even date, herein incorporated by reference, which application is related to L.N. Jungheim, U.S. Patent Application No. 728,734 filed April 30, 1985. The stereospecific synthesis of which pyrazolidinium ylides of Formula A is diagramed below in Scheme 2. Scheme 2EMI19.1 Protected serlne acyl hydrazide N Trifluoroacetyl acyl hydrazide Chiral 1 Trifluoroacetyl diazolidine ion Chiral diazolidine Chiral ylide The above Scheme depicts the synthesis of 4 S t butoxycarbonylamino ylide conpounds. Ylide compounds with the 4 R configuration are synthesized by starting with protected D serine acyl hydrazide instead of the L isomer depicted above. Either the 4 R or the 4 S compounds with amino protecting groups other than t butoxycarbonyl are synthesized from a protected serine acyl hydrazide with an aminoprotecting group other than t butoxycarbonyl. The protected serine acyl hydrazide precursor of Scheme 2 is synthesized in a procedure analogous to B. Iselin and R. Schwyzer, Help. Chim. Acta, 44, p.169 1961 . The precursor is then acylated with the trifluoroacetyl moiety, as set forth in Reaction 4 in the Scheme. The acylation is carried out in ethanol with an excess of ethylthio trifluorothioacetate ET TFA . The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 65 hours. The N trifluoroacetyl acyl hydrazide obtained is reacted with triphenylphosphine TPP and diethyl azodicarboxylate DEAD as depicted above in Reaction 5. Although the above Scheme depicts only the use ofDEAD, the reaction will also proceed if either dimethyl azodicarboxylate or di iso propyl azodicarboxylate are used . The stoichiometry of the process of Reaction 5 has the N trifluoroacetyl acyl hydrazide1 phosphine and diethyl azodicarboxylate reagent present in at least approximately a 1 1 1 molar ratio The reaction will proceed in the presence of molar excesses above this ratio of any of the reagents or of the starting material. The reaction is initiated by first combining in any order the solvent, the N trifluoroacetyl acyl hydrazide and the phosphine, and secondly adding the azodicarboxylate reagent. The reaction temperature of Reaction 5 is not a critical parameter. The process can be carried out at a reaction temperature from approximately the freezing point to approximately the reflux temperature of the solvent. The preferred reaction temperature is approximately room temperature. The duration of Reaction 5 can be from approximately five minutes to approximately twenty four hours.The progress of the process can be monitored by standard methods e.g., thin layer chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography, etc. The process is stopped when the monitoring method demonstrates that the reaction is substantially complete. The solvents for the Reaction are aromatic hydrocarbon solvents such as benzene, toluene, xylenes, etc. ethers such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, or 1,4 dioxane chlorinated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, dichloroethane, or chlorobenzene amides such as dimethylformamide and dimethylacetamide and other solvents such as hexamethylphosphoramide. Tetrahydrofuran is the preferred solvent. It is also desirable, but not essential, to dry and deoxygenate the solvent before use in the process. The chiral 1 trifluoroacetyl diazolidine obtained from Reaction 5 is deacylated with dilute sodium hydroxide solution to yield the chiral 1 unsub stituted diazolidine. The deacylation reaction is represented as Reaction 6 in Scheme 2. The reaction entails generally suspending the chiral l trifluoroacetyl diazolidine in water then adding at least two equivalents dilute aqueous sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide solution. For instance, a two fold excess of 1M sodium hydroxide can be used.It is preferred that the initial pB of the solution be from between about 11 to about 12. The resultant solution is stirred from about 10 minutes to about 3 hours at a temperature from about 100C to 250C. When the reaction is substantially complete the reaction solution is neutralized by the addition of dilute acid, such as IN hydrochloric acid. The optimal reaction time for Reaction 6 can be determined by monitoring the progress of the reaction by conventional means such as chromatographic techniques thin layer chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography, or column chromatography and spectroscopic methods, alone or in conjunction with chromatographic techniques, such as infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry and mass spectrometry. A preferred time period is from between 30 minutes to about 1.5 hours. The final reaction of Scheme 2, wherein the chiral diazolidines are converted to the chiral pyrazo 4 dinium ylides, is carried out using the conditions described for the analogous reaction Reaction 3 in Scheme 1. The ylides of Formula 1 are intermediates to bicyclic pyrazolidinone antimicrobials and the corresponding intermediates of the Formula 2.EMI23.1 In Formula 2, R1 and R2 are the same as for R1 and R2 in the instant ylides. R3 and R4 in Formula 2 includes all the substituents of R3 and R4 of the instant ylides, plus substituents when either R3 or R4 is hydrogen and the other is an acyl group derived from a C1 to C30 carboxylic acid. Examples of such acyl groups are the acyl groups bonded to the 6 and 7 amino groups of penicillins and cephalosporins, respectively . R8 andR7 in Formula 2 can be a variety of substituents, including a group of the formula COORs wherein R5 means the same as it does for the instant ylide compounds and can also represent hydrogen or an organic or inorganic cation. Further examples of substituents at R1, R2, R3, R4, R6 and R7 in Formula 2 can be found in L.N. Jungheim, S.K. Sigmund, C.J.Barnett, R.E. Holmes and R.J. Ternansky, EuropeanPatent Application No., referenceX 5841A filed this even date, herein incorporated by reference, which application is related to U.S.Patent Application No. 729,021 filed April 30r 1985. The bicyclic pyrazolidinones of Formula 2 are synthesized, for example, by various 1,3 dipolar cycloaddition reaction with the instant ylides and a substituted acetylene as shown below in Scheme 3 Scheme 3EMI24.1 ylide 1 acetylene 2 In the above Scheme 3, for brevity s sake,Formula 2 indicates only one of the two possible 2,3 regioisomer products of the reaction. The reaction represented by Scheme 3 can also produce the opposite 2,3 regioisomer as well as a mixture of the regioisomers. In the above Scheme, R1 and R2 are as defined above for Formula 1, R6 and R7 are as defined forFormula 2 and either R3 or R4 is an amino protecting group and the other of R3 or R4 is hydrogen. When carrying out the reaction derivative with protecting groups, it is preferable to protect any of the acidic groups represented by R1, R2, R8 or R7. Examples of such acidic groups are the carboxylic acid group and the hydroxyimino group. It is especially preferred that any carboxylic acid groups be protected. The reaction should be carried out in aprotic solvents. Examples of such solvents are the chlorinated hydrocarbons, the aromatic hydrocarbons and alkyl or aromatic cyano solvents. The preferred solvents for the above reaction are dichloromethane, acetonitrile, and 1,2 dichloroethane. The temperature for the reaction is not critical. It is preferred that the reaction be carried out between about room temperature to about the reflux temperature of the solvent. The reaction usually requires a period of about 1 to about 168 hours. The optimal reaction time can be determined by monitoring the progress of the reaction by conventional means such as chromatographic techniques thin layer chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography, or column chromatography and or spectroscopic methods such as infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry and mass spectrometry . The usual stoichiometry for the reaction is a 1 1 ratio of ylide to acetylene reagent. Of course, an excess of either reagent is permissible. It is preferred that the acetylene reagent be present in excess, and especially preferred that the acetylene be present in a 2 1 excess. Furthermore, the order of addition of either reagent is not critical. The regiospecificity of the cycloaddition inScheme 3 is unpredictable. The stereochemical and electronic properties of the ylide and acetylene and the various reaction conditions have as yet yielded no clearly discernable regiospecific trends. Usually the reaction yields widely varying mixtures of 2,3 regioisomer products. The stereospecificity of the cycloaddition ofScheme 3 at the C7 position of the bicyclic pyrazolidinone is determined by the stereochemistry at the C4 position of the instant ylide intermediates. Thus, a mixture of 4 R and 4 S stereoisomers of the ylide will yield a corresponding mixture of 7 R and 7 S stereoisomers of bicyclic pyrazolidinones. Similarly, chiral ylide starting material will yield chiral bicyclic pyrazolidinones. Thus, a 4 Sr ylide will yield the 7 S bicyclic pyrazolidinone. The compounds produced by Scheme 3 above are the 7 protected amino compounds of Formula 2 i.e., when either 3 or R4 is an amino protecting group and the other of R3 or R4 iS hydrogen . In order to enhance the antimicrobial activity of the bicyclic pyrazolidinone compounds, it is necessary to replace the amino protecting group with an acyl group derived from a C1 to C30 carboxylic acid. As discussed above, the acyl groups employed are typically those used to achieve the same purpose when bonded to the 6 amino group of a penicillin or a 7 amino group of a cephalosporin. The first step for the acylation of a 7 protected amino bicyclic pyrazolidinone compounds 7protected amino nucleus is the removal of the amino protecting group. The conditions for the removal of these groups are well known in the cephalosporin and penicillin arts. For example, the trimethylsilyl protecting group is removed by simple hydrolysis. The t butoxycarbonyl group is removed by acidic hydrolysis trifluoroacetic acid , and the allyloxycarbonyl group is removed as a palladium complex. Removal of the acid labile amino protecting groups usually yields the 7 amino nucleus as a salt. The salt of the nucleus is neutralized by conventional procedures before acylation. For instance, the removal of the t butoxycarbonyl group with trifluoroacetic acid leaves the trifluoroacetate salt of the resultant 7 amino compound. The salt is taken up in tetrahydrofuran and bis trimethylsilyl trifluoroacetamide is added to yield the corresponding desalinated 7 compound. The neutralized free amino compound can be isolated or acylated in situ. Similarly, the removal of the t butoxycarbonyl group with a mixture of hydrochloric acid in acetic acid leaves the hydrochloride salt adduct of the bicyclic pyrazolidinone. The hydrochloride adduct is treated with a base such as N methylmorpholine to yield the 7 amino neutralized analog. Conversion of the hydrochloride adduct to the 7 amino compound is usually done in situ. The methods for the acylation of the neutralized 7 amino bicyclic pyrazolidinone with the acyl side chain are similar to the methods for the acylation of 6 aminopenicillanic acid, 7 aminodesacetoxycephalosporanic acid and 7 aminocephalosporanic acid. One method is to simply combine the 7 amino nucleus with an acid chloride or acid bromide in the presence of an acid scavenger. The acid chloride or acid bromide may be formed in situ. Another method is to combine the 7 amino nucleus with the free carboxylic acid form of the side chain or its acid salt and a condensing agent.Suitable condensing agents include N,N disubstituted carbodiimides such as N,N dicyclohexylcarbo diimide, N,N diethylcarbodiimide, N,N di n propyl carbodiimide, N,N di iso propyl carbodiimide, N,N diallylcarbodiimide, N,N bistp dimethylaminophenyl carbodiimide, N ethyl N 4 ethylmorpholinyl carbodiimide and the like. Other suitable carbodiimides are disclosed by Sheehan in U.S. Patent No. 2,938,892 and by Hofmann et al. in U.S. Patent No. 3,065,224.Azolides, such as N,N1 carbonyldiimidazole and N,N thionyldiimidazol, may also be used. Dehydrating agents such as phosphorus oxychloride, alkoxyacetylenes and 2 halogenopyridinium salts such as 2 chloropyridinium methyl iodide, 2 fluoropyridinium methyl iodide, and the like may be used to couple the free acid or its acid salt with the 7 amino nucleus. Another acylation method entails first converting the free carboxylic acid form or the corresponding salt of the acyl side chain to the active ester derivative which is in turn used to acylate the nucleus. The active ester derivative is formed by esterifying the free acid form with groups such as p nitrophenol, 2,4 dinitrophenol, trichlorophenol, pentachlorophenol, N chlorosuccinimide, N chloro maleic imide, N chlorophthalimide , 2 chloro 4, 6 dimethoxy triazene, l hydroxy lH benzotriazole or l hydroxy 6chloro lH benzotriazole. The active ester derivatives can also be mixed anhydrides, formed with groups such as methoxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl, iso butoxycarbonyl, trichloromethylcarbonyl, and iso but 2 ylcarbonyl and the carboxylic acid of the acyl side chain.The mixed anhydrides are formed by acylating the carboxylic acid of the acyl side chain. Alternatively, the 7 amino nucleus can be acylated with the N ethoxycarbonyl 2 ethoxy 1,2 dihydro quinoline EEDQ derivative of the acyl side chain. In general, the free acid form of the acyl side chain and EEDQ are reacted in an inert, polar organic solvent e.g. tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, etc. . The resultant EEDQ derivative is used in situ to acylate the 7 amino nucleus. Once the bicyclic pyrazolidinones are acylated with the appropriate acyl group derived from a C1 toCso carboxylic acid, they are converted to the corresponding antimicrobial final product form by removing any remaining amino, hydroxy and or carboxy protecting groups on the molecules. As discussed above, such removal methods are well known in the cephalosporin, penicillin and peptide arts. Once the carboxy groups are deprotected, the oral ester may be put on the desired carboxy group s at R1, R2, R8 and R7. The methods for making the oral ester derivatives are well known in the cephalosporin and penicillin art. The antimicrobial compounds of Formula 2 inhibit the growth of certain organisms pathogenic to man and animals. The antimicrobial compounds of Formula 2 are compounds wherein the various amino, hydroxy and or carboxy protecting groups have been removed. The antimicrobial activity can be demonstrated in vitro using standard tube dilution techniques. The in vitro tests demonstrate that, in general, the 7 S bicyclic pyrazolidinones have better antimicrobial activity than both the corresponding 7 R isomers and also a mixture of the two isomers.Representative pathogens which are sensitive to the antimicrobial compounds includeStaphylococcus aureus X1.1, Streptococcus pyogenes C203,Streptococcus pneumoniae Park, Remophilus influenzae 76 ampicillin resistant , Escherichia coli N10, Escherichia coli EC14, Escherichia coli TEM b lactamase producer , Klebsiella pneumoniae X26, Klebsiella pneumoniae KAE B lactamase producer , Klebsiella pneumoniae X68, Enterobacter aerogenes C32,Enterobacter aerogenes EB17, Enterobacter cloacae EB5 non B lactamase producer , Salmonella typhi X514,Salmonella typhi B35, Serratia marcescens X99, Serratia marcescens SE3, Proteus morganii PR15, Proteus inconstans PR33, Proteus rettgeri C24, Citrobacter freundii CF17, and the like. The antimicrobial compounds for which the compounds of this invention are intermediates are useful for the therapeutic or prophylactic treatment of infections in warm blooded animals caused by gram positive, gram negative and acid fast bacteria. The antimicrobial compounds can be administered orally, parenterally e.g. intravenously, intramuscularly or subcutaneously or as a topical ointment or solution in treating bacterial infections of warm blooded animals.
