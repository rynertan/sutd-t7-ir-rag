# Liquid level gauges.

## Abstract
A water level gauge comprises a column 10 for contain ing water, a plurality of light sources 14 on one side of the column and a plurality of detector assemblies 28 on an oppo site side of the column. Filters 16 are utilised to project red and green light through the column 10 . Each detector as sembly 28 includes a red detector 30 and a green detector 32 with red and green filters 26, 24 , respectively. Due to the difference in offset of light beams transversing the column at an oblique angle through water and through air, the green detector 32 is activated by green light when the green and red light passes through the water in the column and the red detector 30 is activated when tha light passes though air in the column, that is, above the water level 20 in the column. By means of a circuit connected to each detector assembly 28 , it is possible to discover the level 20 of water in the column 10 .
