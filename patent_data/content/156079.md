# POLYETHER POLYOXYALKYLENE PREPOLYMERS AND BLOCK COPOLYMERS MADE THEREFROM

## Abstract
Polyether prepolymers are made by reacting a polyoxyal kylene having a star shaped molecule with at least 3 terminal OH groups and an N chlorocarbonyl lactam the prepolymer has the formula The polymer is reacted in the presence of an anionic catalyst with a lactam the resultant copolymer is of the for mula The copolymer can be formed to shape, e.g. a sheet, and has good physical properties including impact strength and freedom from yellowing.
