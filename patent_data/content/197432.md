TITLE OF THE INVENTION ENANTIOSELECTIVE PROCESS FOR PRODUCING 1 BETA METHYLCARBAPENEM ANTIBIOTIC INTERMEDIATESBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention This invention relates to a stereocontrolled process for producing l betamethyl carbapenem antibiotic intermediates involving reacting a beta lactam with a chiral thia or oxazolidinone enolate to preferentially produce a beta methyl intermediate which can be transformed into a carbapenem antibiotic. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DISCLOSURES IN THE ART Since the discovery of thienamycin,EMI2.1 an extremely potent broad spectrum antibiotic, disclosed and claimed in commonly assigned U.S.P.3,950,357, a large amount of research activity has been conducted in the medicinal chemistry area for other active analogs not having its associated deficiencies, i.e. chemical instability at high concentration and susceptability to renal dipeptidase. In addition to the N formimidoyl derivative of thienamycin, disclosed and claimed in commonly assigned U.S.P. 4,194,047, among some of the more promising analogs that have been developed are the l betamethyl compounds of structure I , i.e.,EMI2.2 in which the 1 methyl group is in the beta configuration and R is a radical known in the antibiotic art. Synthesis of the above 1 beta methyl analogs is desired in large quantities for derivatization and pharmacological evaluation and requires introduction of the beta methyl substituent in a manner designed to yield a high percentage of the beta methyl intermediate prior to ring closure. A published procedure by Shih et al. inHeterocycles, Vol. 21, No. 1, pp. 29 40 1984 describes a process for alkylating the 4 alkyl side chain of certain in azetidine 2 ones to produce a mixture of the alpha and beta methyl epimers in about a 4 1 molar ratio.

Japanese reference Kokai 60 19763, Jan. 31, 1985, illustrates related aldol condensation utilizing silyl enol ethers employing non chiral oxazolidinones. However, none of these references specifically teach the introduction of a carbon chain onto an azetidinone ring system directly resulting in a carbon chain methyl substituent in the desired beta configuration. It is therefore an object of this invention to provide a steroselective process for producing intermediates useful in making l betamethylcarbapenem antibiotics. It is further an object of this invention to provide a process for producing intermediates in high yield having the necessary l beta methyl sterochemistry, prior to ring closure to the carbapenem ring system, in which the products contain the beta methyl alpha methyl epimers in a molar ratio greater than one. These and further objects of the invention will become obvious from the accompanying disclosure as set forth herein.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It has been found that by condensing an azetidinone with an Z enolate containing a chiral 2thia or oxazolidinone moiety, intermediates of desired stereochemistry can be obtained which are useful in the synthesis of l ss methyl carbapenem antibiotics.

The chiral auxiliary portion of the enol ether EMI17.1 can be any of the following four membered heterocyclic ring systems EMI17.2 Although all of the ring systems are applicable and included in the subject process, ring system A is preferred due to its higher stability in the basic hydrolysis step and its ability to retain its chiral identity throughout a subsequent recycle step. Preferably, the subject process is carried out with ring system A as the chiral enol ether according to the scheme Reaction SchemeEMI18.1 As is seen in the above preferred oxazolidinone reaction scheme, azetidinone III is reacted with the preformed chiral enol ether IV inStep a to produce the azetidinone amide II. The resulting structure II is hydrolyzed in Step b by suitable means, including use of lithium hydroxide reagent, under basic hydrolysis conditions to produce final compound V which is azetidinone alkyl carboxylic acid. Structure V, wherein R1 is preferably a beta methyl group, is an intermediate useful in production of l beta methyl carbapenem antibiotic reagents as described hereinbefore.Specific and general reaction conditions and parameters are discussed in detail below. The novelty of the subject process illustrated above resides in the fact that it has been found that reaction of the particular azetidinone and the chiral enol ether leads to resulting intermediate structure II, in which hydrogen at the C 4 azetidinone position is selectively in the alpha configuration and the R1 substituent immediately adjacent to that on the alkyl chain can be selectively be chosen to be in the alpha or beta position depending upon substituents R4 andR5 on the chiral oxazolidinone ring and the specific enolating agent used. A bulky alkyl, aralkyl or aryl substituent which is sterically larger by comparison, in the R4 position, with R5 being hydrogen or sterically smaller alkyl, aralkyl or aryl, results in R1 being in the beta configuration which is the most highly desired and preferred configuration.The reverse situation prevails when R4 H, and is the bulky substituent wherein the resulting azetidinone l alkyl product is in the alpha configuration. Any R4 group which is chemically inert under the reaction conditions, and is sterically larger in size or volume than R5, also being chemically inert, will direct the condensation course toward the beta isomer under the reaction conditions described herein. The same description also applies to R6 when other than H, generally chosen in tandem with R5 on the same face of the 5 membered heterocyclic ring, is chemically inert under the reaction conditions, and tends to act in concert with R5 to aid in the stereoselectivity. The resulting stereochemistry and facial selectivity described above is generally applicable when using boron or silicon based enolating agents in the process, e.g. dialkylboron triflate or trialkylsilyl triflate. That is, when R5 is H andR4 a sterically larger substituent on the oxazolidinone ring system, the resulting condensation product contains R1 in the beta configuration, and vice versa. Use of the other enolating agents as described herein will selectively yield either the alpha or beta isomers upon condensation with the azetidinone to yield products within the scope of the subject composition described herein, but may exhibit slightly different courses of stereoselectivity. If the enolating agent selected, together with a 4.specific chiral enol ether e.g. R isopropyl, R5 H yields the alpha isomer, under the conditions described herein, then it will be obvious to one skilled in the art to repeat the reaction under the same conditions, without undue experimentation, utilizing instead the mirror image form of the chiral enol ether eg. R4 H, R5 isopropyl to obtain the desired beta isomer. Thus, the results from one reaction will yield the total information required to selectively derive either the alpha or beta isomer from any one given set of reaction conditions and reactant materials. A further novelty of the overall process of the instant invention is a modified and simplified hydrolysis step of structure II to structure V utilizing basic hydrolysis conditions, preferably lithium hydroxide reagent alone in solvent, to achieve hydrolysis of the amide II to the resulting carboxylic acid V in which chirality is preserved and in which the chiral oxazolidinone can be recycled for use in Step a . Step a is generally carried out by first forming the enolate compound IV by reacting the corresponding chiral compound, e.g. N acyl oxazolidinone VII , with an appropriate enolating agent R8X VIII and base EMI22.1 where R8X can be trimethylsilyl triflate, boron trifluoride etherate, di n butylboron triflate, and the like, as described herein, and the base can be an organic nitrogen base to neutralize produced organic acid from the reaction, including trialkylnitrogen or heterocyclic nitrogen compounds, e.g. trimethylamine, triethylamine, pyridine, diisopropylethylamine and the like. Preferred is diisopropylethylamine. Generally, a 1.1 to 1.0 molar ratio or greater of enolating agent R8X to N acyl oxazolidinone VII is used, coupled with a 1.2 to 1.0 molar ratio, or greater, of organic nitrogen base to N acyl oxazolidinone, to effect substantially complete enolate formation. When utilizing a dialkylboryl enolating agent, e.g. di n butylboryl triflate, it is found advantageous to utilize at least a 1.1 1.0 molar ratio of the boryl agent to the N acyl oxazolidinone together with about at least a 1.2 1.0 molar ratio of organic nitrogen base to the oxazolidinone and allow enolate formation to proceed to completion. After formation of the Z enolate is complete, the Lewis acid is added, in about a 1 1 to 3 1 equivalent ratio to the enolate, followed by the azetidinone which is, in a 1 1 molar ratio based on the oxazolidinone together with another 1.1 equivalents of boron enolating agent and 1.2 eqivalents of base.The excess boryl enolating agent is found to maximize the yield of condensation product and is thought to be operating as a protecting blocking agent involving the ring azetidinone amide nitrogen atom, where the beta lactam ring nitrogen is unsubstituted. Where the N atom is blocked, the excess enolating agent is generally not required. The enolate can also be formed in situ by the addition of Structure VII, enolating agent, base, azetidinone, and Lewis acid in a one step one pot sequence. Generally, this step is performed at 780C, or at room temperature, in the same solvent used for the condensation step, e.g. methylene chloride and is also generally conducted under dry, inert atmosphere, preferably at atmospheric pressure, usually dry nitrogen gas. Generally the solution is stirred at 780C for a brief period, e.g. 15 30 minutes, allowed to warm to about 0 for 1 2 hours, prior to reaction of the formed enolate with azetidinone Compound III. After the enolate has been formed, and additional enolating agent added if desired, the azetidinone is added subsequently to the Lewis acid catalyst and the mixture stirred under nitrogen at 0 250C, preferably 20 250C for 1 2 hours at room temperature. In cases where the Lewis acid is only partially soluble, methylene chloride can be added to improve the solution. The Lewis acid catalyst used in Step a include zinc halides, including zinc iodide, zinc chloride, and zinc bromide boron trifluoride etherate magnesium halide, i.e. chloride RAlCl2 where R is C14 alkyl TiX3 or TiX4, where X is halo, preferably C1 SnC14 SnCl2 stannous triflate FeC13 trialkylsilyl sulfonates, eg.trimethylsilyl triflate dialkylboron sulfonates, eg.diethylboron triflate and the like. Preferred Lewis acid catalyst in the reaction is zinc bromide and boron trifluoride etherate. A preferred mode of operation for preforming the enolate in Step a is to preferably conduct the reaction at either 780C, or at room temperature. By so doing, the Z isomer, rather than the E isomer of the enolate is preferentially formed. The terms Z and E isomer are well known in the art and refer to the configurations of substituents about the double bond where the cis trans system of nomenclature is inadequate. See for example, Organic Chemistry by Alan S. Wingrove and Robert L.Cant, Harper B. Row Publishers, New York, 1981, p.250. In general, the higher the yield of the desired Z enolate isomer during enolate formation, the higher the yield of the condensation product in Step a . Conducting the reaction at temperatures intermediate between 780 to 250C results in mixtures of Z and E isomers, which still allows the novel invention process to be carried out, but however resulting slightly reduced beta alpha isomeric ratios. Also in a preferred mode of operation, it is found beneficial to operate at molar ratios of about 2.2 1, of the enolating agent to the N acyloxazolidi none, where the enolating agent is preferably a dialkylboron triflate, particularly preferred being diethylboron triflate, and where preferably theN propionyloxazolidone VII contains R4 as isopropyl and R5 as H. Utilizing this amount of boron enolating agent is found to result in increased yields, presumably due to additional complexing behavior between the enolating agent and the azetidinone. Further, use of a proportionately larger amount of organic nitrogen base, preferably diisopropylethylamine, results in an increased amount of condensation product. It should be noted that the dialkylboron triflate enolating agent can be prepared independently or can be generated in situ, for example, the reaction of 1 mole of triethylboron and 1 mole triflic acid, e.g. trifluoromethanesulfonic acid i.e.,EMI25.1 Generally, the reaction can be carried out at OOC resulting in about a quantitative yield of enolating agent. Following formation of the enolate, the condensation step of Step a is carried out. Reaction conditions for Step a include the use of a dry aprotic solvent. Representative examples of suitable solvents include aliphatic hydrocarbons including pentanes, hexanes, heptanes, aromatic hydrocarbons including benzene, toluene and halogenated hydrocarbons including chlorobenzene, carbon tetrachloride, methylene chloride and the like. A preferred solvent is methylene chloride. Typical concentrations of the azetidinoneIII and the initially formed chiral enol ether IV used in Step a are usually in the range of 0.1 to 1.0 Molar and preferably 0.1 to 0.2 Molar. The temperature used during the condensation of III and IV in Step a is normally carried out in a temperature range of 0. to 250C and preferably in the region of 20 to 25 C. Step a of the process is generally carried out at atmospheric pressure in a dry atmosphere preferably in a nitrogen or argon atmosphere. Time of the reaction is normally in the range of 0.5 to 10 hours being sufficient to achieve yields in the range of 80 to 95 . A preferred mode of carried out Step a in addendum to the preferred mode of preforming the enolate, described above, is to conduct the condensation at room temperature with a substantially pure solution of Z isomer, utilizing an azetidinoneIII having R9sH and R2 protected hydroxy OR8, where R8 trialkylsilyl blocking group, preferably dimethyl t butylsilyl, in a molar ratio or about 1 1 based on the amount of starting chiral N acyloxazolidinone. Particularly preferred is where the chiral oxazolidinone moiety has R4 isopropyl and R5 H. Further, following the condensation step, an oxidizing agent, such as 30 H2O2, may be added to convert excess boron organics to boric acid as an aid in reducing the number of side products preceding the subsequent basic hydrolysis step. The separation, isolation, and purification of resulting structure II in the reaction is generally carried out by techniques known in the art particularly involving crystallization and chromatography. The starting azetidinone of Structure III is known in the art and can be prepared by several procedures including that described in the hereby incorporated by reference of Paul J. Reider andEdward J. Grabowski in Tetrahedron Letters, Vol. 23, pp. 2293 2296 1982 starting with L aspartic acid resulting in structure III, where R2 is l hydroxyethyl, and R9 is H, by a lead acetate oxidation of the corresponding 4 carboxy azetidinone in DMF HOAc media. This is particularly a preferred method for synthesis of structure III in which different alkylation reagents can be used to derive, via known methods, all of the R2 and R9 substituents included within the scope of the disclosed composition II. Another reference disclosing the starting azetidinone 4 acetate is Tett dron, Vol. O, No.10, pp. 1795 1802 1984 hereby incorporated by reference for this purpose. A further method is described in the reference Tetrahedron, Vol. 39, No. 15, pp. 2505 2513 1983 hereby incorporated by reference also for this particular purpose. The following synthetic scheme taken from the above cited Tetrahedron, Vol. 39 reference, is presented below for illustration purposes, and is also a convenient methodology for readily obtaining all of the structures encompassed by the scope of Structure III, incorporating different hydroxy and alkyl species for R2, starting with 6 aminopenicillanic acid EMI28.1 EMI29.1 As is seen, methyl 6,6 dibromopenicillanate 23 is readily obtained from 22 6 aminopenicillanic acid by diazotization bromination at 50C usingBr2, NaNO2, H2SO4, H2O CH2Cl2, followed by esterification of the crude dibromo acid. 23 underwent metalhalogen exchange with methylmagnesium bromide in THF at 780C to give an enolate intermediate, which on quenching with excess acetaldehyde, affords a mixture of hydroxyethyl products in high yield.At this point, use of acetaldehyde leads to the l hydroxyethyl analog, whereas use of the following alkylating agents, including aldehydes and ketones, leads to the corresponding alkyl, fluoroalkyl and hydroxyalkyl products Alkylating Agent R2 or R9 ProductCH2O HOCH2 CH3 2CO CH3 2CH OH CH3COCH2CH3 CH3C OH CH 2CH3 CH3CH2CHO CH3CH2C OH H Alkylating Agent R2 or R9 ProductCH3CH2CH2CHO CH3CH2CH2CH OH CH3 2cHcHo CH3 2CH CH OH CH3I CH3CH3CH2Br CH3CH2 CH3 2CHBr CH3 2CH CF3CHO CF3CHOHCHF2CHO CHF2CHOHCH2FCHO FCH2CHOHF2CHI F2CHF3CI F3CCH3CF2I CH3CF2 CH2 2C O CH2 2COH These reagents, useful in alkylating the azetidinone ring are described in USP 4,383,946, hereby incorporated by reference for this particular purpose. The major bromohydrin 24 having the desiredR configuration at the OH bearing carbon can be isolated by a combination of chromatography and crystallization. Stirring 24 with 3 molar equivalents of zinc in a mixture of diethyl ether and aqueous ammonium acetate at room temperature affords a 91 9 mixture of trans and cis isomers 25a,b. The mixture of alcohols is converted to the corresponding mixtures of t butyldimethylsilyl derivatives 26a and 26b by reaction with t butyldimethylchlorosilane inDMF with imidazole base at room temperature and the thiazolidine ring is then disrupted by the use ofHg OAc 2 in HOAc at 900C to yield 27, being the major isomer.Oxidation of the mixture with a catalytic amount of potassium permanganate and sodium periodate in buffered acetone removes the N isopropylidine acetate group to produce a mixture of azetidinones in which the major isomer is isolated to result in 28. Further defining the structure of III, R2 and R9 are independently hydrogen, C1 4 linear, branched or cyclic alkyl, unsubstituted or substituted with fluoro, hydroxy, or protected hydroxy with the proviso that both R2 and R9 are not unsubstituted alkyl, which situation generally leads to compounds of marginal antibiotic activity. Representative examples of R2 groups include H, HO CH2 , CH3CHOH , CH3 2COH , CH2 2COH ,CH3CH2 OH , CH3CH2CH2 OH , CH3CH2CH OH , CH3 CH3 CH CH OH , CH3 , CH3CH2 t CH3 2CH , CH3CH2CH2CH2 , CH3 CF3CHOH , CHF2CHOH , FCH2CHOH , CHjCHF CH C HF , CH2CF2 and the like. Preffered R2 group is CH3CHOH , i.e., 1 hydroxyethyl, and a preffered R9 group isH, preferably a beta H in position 3 of the azetidinone ring. The protected hydroxy is known in the antibiotic art and refers to a hydroxyl group protected by a suitable radical rendering it inactive during chemical reaction. The chemical reaction in the instant case of the azetidinone with the chelated enolate followed by hydrolysis of the resulting 2 oxo 1,3 oxazolidinone moiety to the corresponding carboxylic acid in the presence of LiOH under hydrolysis conditions. Suitable protecting groups which are known include p or o nitrobenzoxycarbonyl produced for example by treating the hydroxy compound with 1.5 eq. of p nitrobenzoxycarbonyl chloride and 2.0 eq. of p dimethylaminopyridine in a solvent such as DMF at room temperature for 30 minutes to 6 hours to yield the protected hydroxy product. Alternatively, the protecting group can be organosilyl group, e.g. trimethylsilyl, phenyldimethylsilyl, isopropyldimethylsilyl or t butyldimethylsilyl, formed by treating the hydroxy compound in DMF with for example, t butyldimethyl chlorosilane and imidazole as the base at room temperature for about 2 hours. The protecting groups described above can then be easily removed by acid hydrolysis, for example HC1 in aqueous methanol at room temperature for about one hour. A preferred protecting group is t butyldimethylsilyl. Leaving group L, in structure III is generally a nucleophile which can easily be displaced by the nucleophilic chiral enol ether IV. Representative examples of suitable leaving groups L include acetate, benzoate, trifluoroacetate, tosylate, mesylate, brosylate halide, including C1,Br, I C1 C4 ether, C1 C4 alkylthioether,C1 C4 alkyl sulfone, C1 C4 alkyl sulfoxide, and the like. Preferred leaving group L in the subject process is acetate. R3 can be H or an N protecting group selected generally from protecting groups known in the art which employ hydrogenation, oxidation or acid hydrolysis for removal. Representative protecting groups R3 include the silyl groups described above and further including benzyl, p nitrobenzyl, p nitrobenzoylmethyl, benzhydryl, p methoxybenzyl, 2,4 dimethoxybenzyl, and the like. A preferred protecting group if utilized is silyl, described above. Preferably R3 is H in the process to avoid unnecessary process steps.

A preferred azetidinone structure III useful in the process isEMI37.1 The starting chiral enol ether of structureIV ring system A, can be conveniently prepared for example by the process described in the above cited reference of Evans et al., JACS 1981, 103, pp.2127 2129 and JACS 1982, 104, pp. 1737, hereby incorporated by reference for this particular purpose. Synthesis of structure IV where X1 and X are O, R4 is isopropyl and R5 is H can be accomplished by reacting an aminoalcohol, eq.L valinol, with a bridging cyclization reagent such as liquid diethylcarbonate at 1100C, for 5 15 hours, until ethanol distillation ceases, to effect bridgingcyclization. In this case, the reaction yields 4 S isopropyl 2 oxo 1,3 oxazolidinone. Other amino alcohols which can also be utilized are L phenylalanine leading to 4 S 4 benzyl 2 oxo 1,3 oxazolidinone, L norephedrine,L alanine, L valine, L leucine, L isoleucine,L phenylalanine, L tyrosine, L serine, L threonine,L cysteine, L methionine, and the like. Use of the naturally occurring L amino acids, followed by reduction, such as by BE3.SMe2, BH3.THF, LiAlH4 or NaBH4.EtOH via ethylester.HCl salt in THF,Et2O solvents, 35 700C, for a period of 10 15 hours leads to the L amino alcohol precursor to the structure IVA in which R4 is alkyl or aryl and R5 is H, thus favoring beta methyl configuration after condensation when using boron or silyl enolating agents.Utilizing the analogous D amino acids will result in the opposite form of Structure IVA which will subsequently favor alpha methyl formation during their condensation. These reduction methods are described in Tetrahedron Letters, No. 40, pp.3527 3528 1977 , hereby incorporated by reference for this purpose. The reduction methods can be carried out with very little accompanying racemization. A preferred amino alcohol in the processL valinol. Other bridging cyclization agents include diphenyl carbonate, diethyl carbonate see Homeyer,A. H., U.S. Patent 2,399,118 and Chem. Abstr. 1946 Vol. 40, 4084, both hereby incorporated by reference for this purpose phosgene see Close, W.J.,J. Org. Chem., 1950, Vol. 15, 1131 34, hereby incorporated by reference for this purpose and the like. Preferred is diethyl carbonate. The other ring systems B, C and D of the chiral enol ether are also made by known methods in the art. The method of Bull. Soc. Chim. Bel., 87, 223, 229, 293 and 299 1978 can be used to make ring systemC, and additionally using L valinol, it can be prepared for example EMI39.1 described by the methods in H. A. Staab and G. Walter,Ann., 657, 98, 104 1962 , Carbohydrate Res. Vol. 3, p.205 1966 , and Anqew. Chem. 97, 292 1967 , hereby incorporated by reference for this particular purpose. Likewise, ring system B can be made for example by the method of Fujita et al. in J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982, Vol. 104, pp. 2079 81,EMI39.2 hereby incorporated by reference for this particular purpose. Likewise, ring system D can be made for example, from the thiol amine by the method described above using diethyl carbonate EMI39.3 hereby incorporated by reference for this particular purpose. Methods for preparing the starting thiol amine are well known if the art, e.g.EMI40.1 See A. I. Meyers, et al., J. Org. Chem. 43, 892 1978 EMI40.2 R. P. Volante, Tet. Lett. 3119 1981 Preferred are ring systems A, being, oxazolidinone and B, being thiazolidinethione, both preferably containing a 4 isopropyl substituent, resulting in the corresponding condensation products containing a beta methyl substituent. Following the cyclization reaction, the formed oxazolidinone is N acylated to form the nucleophilic precursor of the molecule. The oxazolidinone is reacted with butyllithium in hexane, to form the conjugate base and then reacted with an acyl halide such as propionyl chloride at 710C, for 0.5 1 hour to yield the N propionyloxazolidinone. Other acylating agents include n butanoyl chloride, n pivaloyl bromide, acetyl choride, and the like. Preferred is n propionyl chloride. The initial step in Step a of the process is to convert the N acyl oxazolidinone structure to the chiral enol ether by reaction with suitable enolating or chelating agent. For example, theN acyl 4 s isopropyloxazolidinone is reacted with the enolating protecting compound, such as trimethylsilyltriflate, in CH2C12 solvent, at 780C, in the presence of diisopropylethylamine proton acceptor, for 15 30 minutes, then for 1 2 hours at OOC to obtain the O trimethylsilyl enol ether. Representative enolating groups R8 are described hereinbelow with their particular structures. R8 is also an easily removable protecting group for the chiral enol ether which will stabilize the compound in the enol structure. The protecting group can simply be a hydroxy protecting group such as derived from a triorganosilicon compound, eg.trimethylsilyl TMS , formed by reacting the oxazolidinone with for example, lithium diisopropylamide and trimethylsilyl chloride in THF, solvent, at 78 C for 1 2 to 2 hours to form the TMS derivative. By the term easily removable protecting group , as used herein, is meant that the R8 group is removed, presumably through the action of theLewis acid during the condensation step without affecting the stability of the enol moiety or its positional influence on the resulting stereochemistry. As is evident from this discussion, the function of the R8 group is twofold first, it serves as a stabilizing force on the enol moiety, which is the reactive center for alkylation attack on the 4 position of the azetidinone ring and secondly, it anchors the enol into the Z enol isomer configuration, rather than the wE , which leads to the desired product stereochemistry in the condensation product. Thus, it simultaneously serves as a protecting group, in addition to being easily removable, and thus facilitating the condensation reaction. Also the protecting group can have the ability to complex the keto group of the oxazolidinone moiety thus more firmly positioning the molecule for the nucleophilic attack on the azetidinone structure. Representative examples of this type enolating agent include the above described dialkylboryl groups, such as di n butylboryl, formed for example by reacting the oxazolidinone with di n butylboryltriflate in CH2C12 solvent, 780C, 1 hour time to form the di n butylboryl derivative. Representative examples of R8 groups useful in the subject process include the radicals trialkylsilyl, including trimethylsilyl, dimethyl t butylsilyl dialkylboryl, including di n butylboryl, dimethylboryl, diethylboryl lithium MgX ZnX AlX2 BR2 BX2, particularly BF2 SnX ZrXR2 where X is halo, i.e.,C1, Br, I, F, preferably F, or triflate and R isC1 C4 alkyl or aryl, preferably methyl or ethyl, and the like, which can be derived for example from their respectives salts, e.q. triflates or halides. Preffered R8 groups in the process are difluoroboryl, di n butylboryl, diethylboryl, trimethylsilyl, and stannous monotriflate. The lithium salt can advantageously be used as an intermediate in forming the other enolating structures. For example, reacting the N propionyl oxazolidinone with LDA under enol forming conditions, resulting Li salt, can be reacted for example with magnesium chloride to form the corresponding magnesium halide enol complex, which can be subsequently utilized in the condensation step. A particularly preferred mode of carrying out the subject process involves the use of R8 BF2 as the enol protecting group in the structure IVA, particularly where X1, X2 are oxygen. Use of BF2 as R8 avoids the use of triflate CF3SOO chemistry which is extremely expensive, air and moisture sensitive, and results in substantially the same yields and beta alpha ratios and eliminates the need for a separate Lewis acid since the BF2 enolate can be readily formed from other enol protected forms of IVA, including trimethylsilyl, dialkylboryl i.e., diethylboryl and the like, by treatment with BF3 etherate, in excess, which acts as the Lewis acid. Further, the boron difluoride enolate can be formed directly fromN alkanoyloxazolidinone itself by treatment withBF3 etherate. The BF2 enolate of Structure IVA can be readily identified in situ on the basis of its 19F and 13C NMR spectra discussed in the Examples 13 and 14 which will be readily appreciated by one skilled in the art for preparing and identifying theBF2 enolate. The BF2 enolate is substantially stable in solution. Also a subject of this invention is a compound of the formula EMI44.1 wherein X1 and x2 are independently 0 or S, R1 is C1 C4 lower alkyl or alkoxyl, R4, R5 and R6 are independently selected from H, C1 C4 alkyl, C7 C10 aralkyl, C6 C10 aryl,C7 C10 alkaryl, which can be substituted with OH, OR10, SH, SR10, where R10 is C C4 alkyl, with the proviso that R4 and R are not identical.Particularly preferred are where X1,X2 are oxygen, R1 is methyl, R5 is H, R4 is isopropyl or phenyl, and R6 is respectively, hydrogen or methyl R1 in structure IV is C1 C4 alkyl or alkoxyl and includes methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n butyl, isobutyl, sec butyl, t butyl, methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, isopropoxy, n butoxy, isobutoxy, sec butoxy, t butoxy, which can also contain substituents such as halogens, e.g. F, C1, and heteroatoms, e.g. 0 , which are inert under the reaction conditions of the subject process. PreferredR1 is methyl. The remaining groups on the oxazolidinone nucleus R4, R5 and R6 are selected from H,C1 C4 alkyl, C7 C10 aralkyl, C6 C1g aryl,C7 C10 alkaryl, which R4, R5 and R6 groups can be substituted with OH, OR10, SH, SR10 wherein R10 is C1 C4 alkyl, preferably methyl, with the proviso that R and R are not identical . The rationale for this proviso is that the position of the substituent has been found to directly affect the stereochemistry of the resulting intermediate. Thus, when utilizing boron or silicon based enolating agents, if R1 is methyl, and R4 is preferably alkyl and R5 is H, the resulting stereochemistry in structure II will predominantly be the beta methyl configuration. Conversely, if R4 is H and R5 is alkyl, then the resulting stereochemistry of structure II will predominantly be alpha methyl configuration. If both R4 and R5 are alkyl, then the resulting product will tend to be a mixture of both epimers, unless one alkyl is substantially sterically larger than the other, e.g., if R4 is t butyl and R5 is methyl, R1 will tend to be of beta configuration. Representative examples of R4, R5 andR6 groups include H, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n butyl, isobutyl, sec butyl, t butyl, benzyl, l phenethyl, 2 phenethyl, 2,4 dimethylphenyl, and the like. Preferred in the process is where R5 beta substituent is H and R4 alpha substituent is C C alkyl, preferably isopropyl, for structures 14 1 IIA and IVA, where X and X2 are either both 0 orS ring structures A or B, respectively .

are illustrative and not meant to be limiting and other combinations of R1, R2, R3, P4 P5 and P6 resulting in other species of Structure II in light of this disclosure, not specifically recited herein, are deemed to be included within the scope of this invention. Preferred compounds of structure II include the following compounds where RÚ is beta methyl R2 is protected l hydroxyethyl preferably protected with DMTBS This hydrogen R4 is isopropyl, isobutyl, sec butyl, benzyl or methyl R5 is hydrogen R6 is hydrogen, and where R4 is methyl, P6 is phenyl. where X1 and X2 are both 0 and where X1 and X2 are both S. The hydrolysis of Structure II to StructureV labeled Step b , in the above illustrated process can be carried out according to conventional procedure in the overall process and can also be individually carried out by the novel modified process claimed herein of utilizing a basic agent, preferably lithium hydroxide, as the sole basic hydrolyzing agent. The reference of Evans et al. JACS, 1982,Vol. 104, 6 pp. 1737 1739 hereinabove describes a general procedure for utilizing a benzyl alcohollithium benzolate mixture in order to achieve hydrolysis accompanied by very little racemization leading to benzyl esters. It has been discovered that lithium hydroxide by itself is a very suitable hydrolysis agent, in the absence of benzyl alcohol, for directly producing the acid without significant attendant racemization. It has also been found that sodium hydroxide, and potassium hydroxide are also effective hydrolysis agents for the beta isomer, if the base is sufficiently solubilized during the reaction, for example, by the addition of crown ether agents, and the like, but that use of NaOH leads to degradation of the alpha epimer. In general the hydrolysis reaction conditions include the use of a polar solvent, in admixture with H20, having suitable solubility forLiOH and Structure II. Representative examples include THF H20, and Et20 H20 and DMF H2O. Preferred is THF H20. The concentration of structure II ahd lithium hydroxide reagents in the hydrolysis medium are in a range of 0.5 to 1.5 molar and preferably 1.0 to 1.2 molar. The temperature of the hydrolysis step is normally carried out in the reaction range ofO to 250C and preferably in a temperature range of 20 to 250C. The pressure that the process is conducted under is generally at atmospheric. Time for conducting Step b is normally in a range of about 3 to 5 hours thereby achieving hydrolysis yields in the range of 90 to 95 . Workup of the product carboxylic acid V including isolation and purification involve conventional techniques such as acid base extraction and crystallization to yield the carboxylic acids. In a preferred embodiment, the process also includes the step of recovering an oxazolidinone of the formula EMI85.1 wherein R4, RS and R6 are described herein, which is formed as a byproduct from the hydrolysisStep b , and converting to the following N acyl compound by reaction with R1 CH2COX wherein R1 is described herein, and X is halo, eg. Br, C1 EMI85.2 and reacting said compound with an enolating agent containing R8 functionality described herein, to yield EMI85.3 which is recycled for use to Step a . In a specific embodiment, following the hydrolysis step, the water soluble lithium salt of the beta methyl azetidinone acid V is recovered by acidification of the aqueous layer, following organic solvent extraction of the resulting hydrolysis mixture.EMI86.1 Step a The resulting organic phase, containing the organic extracts, for example methylene chloride, also contains recovered chiral oxazolidone which remains stable and retains its original chiralty throughout the hydrolysis process. Advantage is taken of this fact by recycling the organic phase back to Step a in which the organic layer is dried, concentrated and then treated with an acyl chloride, e.g. propionyl chloride and base, e.g.n butyllithium, to regenerate the starting N acyl oxazolidinone in Step a .
