# Control system for an optical data recording apparatus.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a closed loop control system for an optical recording apparatus of the read after write type comprising a comparator 20 for comparing the input data signal with a playback signal derived from the read beam 25 which trails the write beam 24 and is modulated by the data pattern inscribed on the recording medium by the write beam 24 . The error signal generated by the comparator 20 is applied to a controller 22 which varies the modulation of the write beam 24 in dependence on the error signal, for example, by modifying the data signal used to drive the write beam modulator 5 . In this way, the control system compensates for nonuniformities in the recording medium and the like so as to ensure that the pattern inscribed by the write beam 24 accurately represents the data to be stored.
