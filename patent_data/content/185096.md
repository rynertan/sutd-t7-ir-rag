## Description
This invention relates to apparatus for controlling the amplitude of a vertical deflection signal. When a television receiver is used as an output display of a microcomputer apparatus, the vertical frequency of an output video signal from the microcomputer apparatus is determined by the number of characters in one line and is not limited to a standard television frequency of say 60Hz, but lies within a range of, for example, 50 to 60Hz. Thus when such a video signal is supplied to a television receiver, there occur problems such as inferior vertical linearity, worse horizontal pin distortion, vertical pull out, and over or under amplitude of the vertical deflection. For example, assuming that the frequency of a vertical sync signal V It has been proposed to correct the change in vertical amplitude due to the difference in vertical frequency between the NTSC and CCIR systems by manual switching in dependence on the television signal to be received. To correct the vertical amplitude automatically, it is necessary to detect the variation in vertical amplitude corresponding to the vertical frequency of the input signal. To do this it has been proposed that a monostable multivibrator be triggered by the vertical sync signal and its output signal integrated, the vertical frequency being determined from the level of the integrated output. However, since the vertical frequency is fairly low, the value of the capacitor required for the integration is large, and there is the problem that the response speed when the vertical frequency changes is low. According to the present invention there is provided apparatus for controlling the amplitude of a vertical deflection signal, the apparatus comprising The invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, throughout which like parts are referred to by like references, and in which Figure 1 shows an embodiment comprising an input terminal 1 receiving a vertical sync signal V The vertical sawtooth voltage appearing as an output of the vertical oscillating circuit 2 is supplied to amplitude detecting circuits 5 and 6. The amplitude detecting circuit 5 compares an amplitude E The detection signals of the amplitude detecting circuits 5 and 6 are supplied to a level discriminating circuit 7. A vertical blanking signal is supplied from a terminal 8 to the level discriminating circuit 7 which discriminates the level only for the vertical blanking interval. For the vertical blanking interval, the level discriminating circuit 7 generates a discrimination output which becomes H when one of the detection signals of the amplitude detecting circuits 5 and 6 is H, and becomes L when both of these detection signals are L. A detection output of the amplitude detecting circuit 6 is supplied to an up down counter 9 as a signal to control the count direction. When the detection output is L, the counter 9 counts up. When the detection output is H, the counter 9 counts down. The vertical sync signal V The gate circuit 11 is turned on when the discrimination output of the level discriminating circuit 7 is H, and is turned off when the discrimination output of the level discriminating circuit 7 is L. The discrimination output of the level discriminating circuit 7 may be supplied to a counter enable terminal in place of the gate circuit 11. The output signal, for example, a four bit output of the counter 9 is supplied to a D A converter 12 and converted into an analogue control voltage V The operation will now be described with reference to Figures 2 and 3. Figure 2A shows a state in which the vertical frequency is FV₁ and the amplitude of the vertical deflection signal is correct. The level relation VT₁ E When the vertical frequency increases from FV₁ and becomes FV₂, the vertical amplitude E A check is likewise made to see if the vertical amplitude E When the vertical frequency decreases from FV₁ and becomes FV₃, the vertical amplitude E A check is similarly made to see if the vertical amplitude E Figure 3A shows the relation between the vertical amplitude E On the other hand, there is the relation as shown in Figure 3B between the control voltage V Due to the above operation, the amplitude is automatically controlled so that the vertical amplitude E Figure 4 shows another example of the circuit to correct the vertical amplitude E A resistor 23 and an FET 24 serving as a variable impedance element are connected in parallel with the detecting resistor 18. The control voltage V As well as the control of the vertical amplitude, the invention can be applied to other problems which are caused when the vertical frequency changes, for example, to the control of the vertical amplitude when correcting the change in amplitude of a vertical parabolic voltage for use in correction of right and left pin distortions.
