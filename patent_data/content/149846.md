# Hermetically sealed metallic oxide hydrogen battery using hydrogen storage alloy.

## Abstract
Hermetically sealed metalic oxide hydrogen battery comprising a metallic oxide as a positive electrode active material 3 and hydrogen as a negative electrode active material 1 , characterized in that the negative electrode is composed of a hydrogen storage alloy represented by the formula MNi An internal pressure of the battery in this invention does not increase even when a charge discharge cycle has been carried out for a long period of time, and a discharge capacity can be maintained at a high level over a prolonged period.
