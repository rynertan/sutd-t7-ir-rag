# Coating infrared fibres.

## Abstract
Infrared optical fibres are provided with hermetic coat ings 6 by decomposition or reaction of volatile compounds of the coating material at the surface of the fibre. Materials having melting points greater than the fibre s glass transition temperatures may thus be applied at temperatures lower than the glass transition temperatures. The fibre 1 may be sufficiently hot from a preceding fibre formation 2,3 process in line with the coating process to enable the decomposition or reaction, or additional heating of the fibre by radiation may be necessary in the reaction chamber 7 .
