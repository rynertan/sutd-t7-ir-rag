# Torque transducing attachments for air driven impact tools.

## Abstract
A torque transducing attachment 2 can be fastened to a air driven impact tool 8 at its rear end. A shaft 20 in bearings 16 in a housing 12 has a torque transformable part 22 with integral bushes 24, 26 with apertures 29 on either side. The relative displacement under torque of the apertures 29 varies the amount of light transmitted from a stabilised LED source 36 to a photo detector 46 and the resulting signal is passed through frequency responsive network.
