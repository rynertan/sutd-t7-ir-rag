# Quick release tube coupling.

## Abstract
The disclosure relates to a quick release tube couplings in which a collet 20 with resilient arms 21 is arranged to co operate with a tapering cam surface 13 in a member 10, 11 surrounding the collet to force the arms to grip a tube within the collet. The member is formed from two, male 10 and fe male 11 parts each having a bore 12 , the male part bore 12 being tapered 13 to provide the cam surface. The male and female parts are assembled with a pair of annular surfaces 16, 17 on the respective parts spaced apart by an edge or projec tion 18 on one of the surfaces 16 and ultrasonic vibration is applied to soften the ridge to cause the surfaces to weld to gether and to allow two other opposed annular surfaces 19 to come together and be welded by said ultrasonic vibration to weld the two parts 10, 11 together at two spaced annular re gions.
