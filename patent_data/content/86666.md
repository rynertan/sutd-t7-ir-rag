# Arrangement for laser scribing of dendrite silicon cells.

## Abstract
A fixture and a method for holding and aligning dendritic web silicon cells during laser scribing to delineate the cell from the dendrites, and includes a see through support on which the cell is placed face down for viewing of a grid structure within an optical receiver transmitter having an outline pattern there on within which the grid structure is viewed for alignment of the cell on the support so that the cell can be laser scribed on the back between the grid structure and the dendrites and along the width dimension so that a predetermined spacing is maintained between the outer edges of the cell encompassing the perimeter of the grid structure.
