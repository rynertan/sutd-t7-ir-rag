## Description
The present invention relates to a process for preparing a polypeptide by culturing a transformed microorganism under suitable conditions, optionally concentrating the polypeptide and collecting same in a manner known Oxidoreductases, especially those which use oxygen as electron acceptor, are enzymes suitable for use in bleaching and or detergent compositions in which they can be used for the Up to now a need exists for oxidase enzymes that are more suitable for use under the conditions of manufacture and use of detergent and bleaching products. For an economically feasible production of these oxidases it is further required to reach a yield of these enzymes in fermentation processes in the order of that of alcohol oxidase of One way of finding new microorganisms producing enzymes in higher amounts or finding new oxidase enzymes having improved properties is to check all sorts of microorganisms and try to isolate the relevant oxidases, which are then checked for their abilities to generate peroxides and their stabilities under the conditions of manufacture and use of detergent and bleaching products. One can hope that some day a suitable enzyme will be found, but the chance of success is unpredictable and probably very low. Another way is to apply another trial and error method of crossing the natural microorganisms producing these oxidases by classical genetic techniques, in the hope that some day one will find a more productive microorganism or a more suitable enzyme, but again the chance of success is rather low. Clearly, a need exists for a method for preparing oxidase enzymes in higher yield and or without the concomitant formation of catalase and or having improved properties during storage and or use in e.g. bleach and or detergent compositions. The problem of trial and error can be overcome by a process for preparing an oxidase enzyme by culturing a microorganism under suitable conditions, and preferably concentrating the enzyme and collecting the concentrated enzyme in a manner known The microorganisms suitable for use in a process for preparing an oxidase enzyme can be obtained by recombinant DNA technology, whereby a microorganism is transformed by a DNA sequence coding for an oxidase enzyme so called structural gene together with one or more other DNA sequences which regulate the expression of the structural gene in a particular microorganism or group of organisms, either via introduction of an episomal vector containing said sequences or via a vector containing said sequences which is also equipped with DNA sequences capable of being integrated into the chromosome of the microorganism. The determination of a structural gene coding for the enzyme alcohol oxidase EC 1.1.3.13 originating from Although the microorganisms to be used can be bacteria, e.g. of the genus Many C₁ utilizing yeasts have been isolated during the last decade, and for The first step in this metabolism is the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde and H₂O₂ catalysed by MOX. Formaldehyde is oxidized further by the action of formaldehyde dehydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase. H₂O₂ is split into water and oxygen by catalase. Alternatively, methanol is assimilated into cellular material. After its conversion into formaldehyde, this product is fixed through the xylulose monophosphate pathway into carbohydrates. Dihydroxyacetone synthase DHAS plays a crucial role in this assimilation process. The appearance of MOX, formate dehydrogenase, formaldehyde dehydrogenase, DHAS and catalase is subject to glucose repression, e.g. on 0.5 glucose. However, synthesis of MOX is derepressed by growth in low concentrations of glucose 0.1 , contrary to the synthesis of DHAS, which is still fully repressed under these conditions Roggenkamp et al., 1984 . Regulation, i.e. the possibility to switch on or off of the gene for the polypeptide concerned, is desirable, because it allows for biomass production, when desired, by selecting a suitable substrate, such as, for example melasse, and for production of the polypeptide concerned, when desired, by using methanol or mixtures of methanol and other carbon sources. Methanol is a rather cheap substrate, so the polypeptide production may be carried out in a very economical way. After derepression of the gene coding for alcohol oxidase MOX by growth on methanol, large microbodies, the peroxisomes are formed. While glucose grown cells contain only a small peroxisome, up to 80 of the internal volume of the cell is replaced by peroxisomes in the derepressed state. The conversion of methanol into formaldehyde and H₂O₂ as well as the degradation of H₂O₂ has been shown to occur in these peroxisomes, while further oxidation or assimilation of formaldehyde most probably occurs in the cytoplasm. This process is a perfect example of compartmentalization of toxic products, of a strong co ordinate derepression of several cellular processes and of the selective translocation of at least two of the enzymes involved in this process. Most of the enzymes involved in the methanol metabolism have been purified and characterized Sahm, 1977, Bystrykh et al, 1981 . Especially methanol oxidase EC 1.1.3.13 has been studied in detail. It is an octamer consisting of identical monomers with an M Under derepressed conditions, up to 20 of the cellular protein consists of MOX. One third of the RNA fraction, isolated from the polyacrylamide gel, was used to procure a radioactive cDNA with reverse transcriptase Edens et al., 1982 . Using alpha ³²P dATP and alpha ³²P dCTP of a high specific activity more than 3000 Ci mM , 20 000 cpm of high molecular weight cDNA was formed during 1 h at 42 C in the presence of human placental ribonuclease inhibitor. Ten g of 150 microgram Fractions that contained DNA of 5 20 kb were pooled and the DNA was precipitated with ethanol. Phage lambda L47.1 was grown, and its DNA was isolated as described by Ledeboer et al. 1984 . The DNA was digested with Deoxyoligonucleotides were synthesized on a Biosearch SAM I gene machine, using the phosphite technique Matteucci and Caruthers, 1981 . They were purified on 16 or 20 polyacrylamide gels in TBE. The deoxyoligonucleotides were radioactively labelled with T₄ polynucleotide kinase and gamma ³²P ATP. The DNA of the MOX clones obtained was digested with different restriction enzymes, separated on 1 agarose gel and blotted onto DBM paper. Hybridizations were performed as described by Wallace et al. 1981 . From clone 4 see Example 1 containing the complete MOX gene, several subclones were made in phage M13mp 8, 9 or M13mp 18, 19 derivatives by standard techniques. Small subclones less than 0.5 kb , cloned in two orientations, were sequenced directly from both sides. From the larger subclones, also cloned in two orientations, sequence data were obtained by an exonuclease LEU 1 CBS N 7171 is an auxotrophic derivative of LR9 CBS N 7172 is an auxotrophic derivative of For the isolation, all procedures were carried out at 30 C instead of 37 C, which is the optimal temperature for growth of this yeast. Yeast cells were mutagenized with 3 ethylmethanesulphonate for 2 hr Fink, 1970 . The reaction was stopped with 6 sodium thiosulphate final concentration and the solution was incubated for another 10 min. Mutagenized cells were then washed once with H₂O and incubated for 2 days on YEPD or YNB supplemented with uracil for segregation and enrichment of uracil auxotrophs followed by a 15 hr cultivation on MN without nitrogen source. Finally a nystatin enrichment was employed for 12 hr on NM with a concentration of 10 ug antibiotic per ml. The treated cells were plated on YNB plates containing 200 ug uracil per ml and 0.8 mg 5 fluoroorotic acid Boeke et al., 1984 . Usually 10⁶ cells were plated on a single plate. Resistant colonies were picked after 3 days of incubation, replica plated twice on YNB plates to establish the auxotrophy. From the auxotrophic mutants ura cells were isolated. Alternatively, 1.5 x 10⁶ yeast cells were incubated in one ml of YNB liquid medium supplemented with 200 ug of uracil and 0.8 mg of 5 fluoroorotic acid. After incubation of 2 days, the treated cells were plated on YNB containing uracil, replica plated twice on YNB and analysed as described above. Such resistant mutants have been shown to be uracil auxotrophs affected at the URA3 or the URA5 locus in Chromosomal DNA from The plasmid pool of The copy number of plasmids conferring autonomous replication in Several protocols were used. Transformation of The URA3 gene of A second procedure for generating integration of the URA3 gene into chromosomal DNA of Total RNA and polyadenylated RNA, isolated from cells grown on methanol, were labelled at their 3 termini with ATP RNA adenyl transferase, and separated on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel Fig. 6 . Apart from the rRNA bands, two classes of RNA appear in the poly adenylated RNA lane, respectively 1 kb and 2.3 kb in length. Since these RNA classes are not found in polyadenylated RNA of ethanol grown cells result not shown , they obviously are transcripts of genes derepressed by growth on methanol. The 2.3 kb class can code for a protein of 700 to 800 amino acids, depending on the length of the non translated sequences. Likewise, the 1 kb class codes for a protein of 250 300 amino acids. Enzymes that are derepressed by growth on methanol and are 700 to 800 amino acids long, most likely are MOX Kato et al., 1976 Roa and Blobel, 1983 and DHAS Bystrykh et al., 1981 . Derepressed enzymes in the 250 to 300 amino acid range are probably formaldehyde and formate dehydrogenase Schütte et al., 1976 . The polyadenylated RNA was characterized further by The 74kd protein can tentatively be assigned to the monomer of MOX, the 58kd protein to the monomer of catalase and the 39kd and 36kd proteins to the monomers of formaldehyde dehydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase, respectively. The 78kd polypeptide possibly is DHAS, while the 42kd polypeptide remains unidentified. After immuno precipitation, both high molecular weight proteins react with the MOX antiserum. Although the 2.3 kb mRNA class induced by growth on methanol obviously codes for at least 2 polypeptides, it seemed a good candidate for screening a Per microgram insert DNA, 300 000 plaques were obtained while the background was less than 1 1000. Two Benton Davis blots, containing about 20 000 plaques each, were hybridized with 15 000 cpm of the mRNA derived cDNA probe. After 3 weeks of autoradiography about 40 50 hybridizing plaques could be detected. All plaques were picked up and five were purified further by plating at lower density and by a second hybridization with the cDNA probe. From four, single hybridizing plaques 1, 3, 4, 5 DNA was isolated. The insert length varied from 8 to 13 kb. The sequence of 30 amino acids at the amino terminus of purified MOX was determined Fig. 8 . Using the most abundant codon use for the yeast By comparing restriction enzyme digests and by cross hybridization experiments it was concluded that clones 1, 4 and 5 covered identical stretches of DNA. In order to definitely establish the nature of this stretch of cloned DNA the insert of clone 4 was analyzed in detail. Hybridization with the amino terminal probe showed that the complete MOX gene ca. 2 kb was present, including 2 kb sequences upstream and 3.5 kb downstream Fig. 10 . DNA sequence analysis of the smallest For sequence analysis, several fragments were subcloned in M13mp8 M13mp9 or M13mp18 M13mp19 respectively in two orientations, as indicated in Fig. 10. Clones that were smaller than 0.5 kb were sequenced directly from both sides. The larger clones were cut at the unique restriction sites situated in the middle of the cloned fragment, to allow generation of exonuclease The sequence contains an open reading frame of 2046 nucleotides that can code for a protein of 664 amino acids. The last codon of the open reading frame codes for Phe, which is in agreement with the carboxy terminus of purified MOX. The amino acid composition derived from the DNA sequence encoding this protein, and the amino acid composition of purified MOX are virtually identical Table III . The only important differences involve the serine and threonine residues, which are notoriously difficult to determine. The calculated molecular weight of the protein is 74 050 Dalton, which agrees well with the molecular weight of 74 kd of MOX, as determined on polyacrylamide SDS gels. In Table IV the codon usage for MOX is given. A bias towards the use of a selective number of codons is evident. The NEO After cleavage of this plasmid with D amino acid oxidase AAO is an example of an oxido reductase for the production of which the methylotrophic The amino acid sequence of the AAO enzyme has been published Ronchi et al., 1981 and the complete gene is synthesised, using the phosphite technique Matteuci and Caruthers, 1981 . The gene is constructed in such a way that the optimal codon use for The construction of the integrative plasmid, containing the AAO gene is shown in Fig. 14A,B. The nearly complete AAO gene is placed upstream of the MOX termination region, by insertion of the AAO gene containing As the selection of cells containing the AAO gene is not simple, another selection marker is introduced. To this end, the Human growth hormone releasing factor HGRF is a small, 44 amino acids long, peptide, that activates the secretion of human growth hormone from the pituitary glands. HGRF can be used in the diagnosis and treatment of pituitary dwarfism in man. Since HGRF has been shown to induce growth hormone stimulation in numerous species, HGRF might be used in the vetinary field too, by stimulating growth of animals and increase of milk production Coudé et al., 1984 . It is difficult to obtain HGRF from human sources, but it could very well be produced by biotechnological processes, once the gene has been cloned and transferred to an appropriate host organism. Also, as a general example of the production of a peptide hormone by For the construction of pUR 3204 and pUR 3205, the gene fragment that codes for the carboxy terminal part of the protein is synthesised in DNA oligomers of about 50 nucleotides in length and subcloned as a The production of small peptides as HGRF by microorganisms is often unstable as a result of enzymic degradation Itakura et al., 1977 . Fusion to a protein like MOX, and subsequent transport to the peroxisomes, could prevent degradation. Therefore, we decided to insert the HGRF gene into the unique This MOX HGRF fusion gene is inserted into pHARS1 by isolation of the whole fusion gene from partially From the length of the open reading frame, from the similarity in the amino acid composition of purified MOX and the DNA derived protein sequence and from the identical 30 N terminal amino acids, it is concluded that the complete gene for MOX from the yeast The protein is not transcribed in the form of a precursor. Based on the determination of the molecular weight, N terminal signal sequences could not be detected in earlier studies of Roa and Blobel 1983 or Roggenkamp et al. 1984 as well. In similar studies, it was suggested that also the rat liver peroxisomal enzymes uricase Goldman and Blobel, 1978 and catalase Goldman and Blobel, 1978 Robbi and Lazarow, 1978 do not contain a cleavable N terminal signal peptide. However, as discussed by these authors, proteolytic degradation could possibly explain the lack of the detection of such a signal sequence. Our sequence results definitely prove that for translocation of this protein to the peroxisome, a cleavable N terminal signal sequence is not required. Such a translocation signal may well be situated in the internal sequence of the mature protein, as is the case for ovalbumine Lingappa et al., 1979 . Inspection of the protein sequence reveals the amino acid sequence Gly X Gly Y Z Gly amino acids 13 18 , which is characteristic for FAD flavin adenine dinucleotide containing enzymes Ronchi et al., 1981 . The isolation of the MOX gene described above gives a way how to determine the DNA sequence coding for MOX and the amino acid sequence of the MOX enzyme. Similarly, the DNA sequences and amino acid sequences belonging to other oxidase enzymes can be isolated and determined. The knowledge of the MOX gene sequence can be used to facilitate the isolation of genes coding for alcohol oxidases or even other oxidases. By comparing the properties and the structure of enzymes one can probably establish structure function and activity relationships. One can also apply methods as site directed mutagenesis, or shortening or lengthening of the protein coding sequences, modifying the corresponding polypeptides, to select oxidase enzymes with improved properties, e.g. with increased alkali stability, improved production, or oxidase enzymes which need a substrate which is more compatible with detergent products. Besides the isolation and characterization of the structural gene for MOX from the yeast The DNA sequence of DAS is given in Fig. 18A 18C. A restriction map is given in Fig. 19. The amino acid composition calculated from the DNA sequence of DAS appeared to be in agreement with the amino acid composition determined after hydrolysis of purified DHAS. The DHAS enzyme catalyses the synthesis of dihydroxyacetone from formaldehyde and xylulose monophosphate. This reaction plays a crucial role in the methanol assimilation process cf. Veenhuis et al., 1983 . As described before, the synthesis of MOX and DHAS is subject to glucose repression. It has now been found that higher levels of MOX are reached when using glucose methanol mixtures as substrates instead of 0.5 v v methanol. Under the former conditions up to 30 of the cellular protein consists of MOX, compared with up to 20 under the latter conditions. It was considered that in the regulons of MOX and DAS sequences must exist that play a decisive role in the regulation of repression derepression by glucose or of the induction by methanol. Some homology therefore might be expected. A striking homology of the TATA boxes has been found, both having the sequence CTATAAATA. No other homologies in the near upstream region of the MOX and DAS regulons have been found. Unexpectedly, a detailed study of both regulons has shown a remarkable homology of the regulons for MOX and DAS in the region about 1000 bp upstream of the translation initiation codon. A practically complete consecutive region of 65 bp in the regulon of MOX is homologous to a 139 bp region in the DAS regulon, interspersed by several non homologous regions see Fig. 20 . A similar homology is not found in any other region of both genes, that are over 4 kb in length including their upstream and downstream sequences. It is suggested that these homologous sequences play a role in the regulation of both genes by glucose and methanol. Transformation studies with vectors containing as regulon the first 500 bp upstream of the ATG of the structural gene of MOX, showed that this shortened MOX regulon gave rise to a relatively low expression of the indicator gene beta lactamase. Indicator genes are genes which provide the yeast with properties that can be scored easily, e.g. the gene for neomycin phosphotransferase giving resistance to the antibiotic G 418 cf. Watson et al., 1983 or an auxotrophic marker such as leucin. The fact that the far upstream homologous regions in the MOX and DAS genes have different interruptions and the fact that DAS is repressed at 0.1 glucose and MOX is not, suggest that these homologous regions are of importance to the repression derepression by glucose and or the induction of the expression in the presence of methanol. This assumption has been found correct indeed, and the presence or absence of these homologous regions can therefore be important for specific applications. For example, if the 1052 to 987 region of the MOX gene or the 1076 to 937 region of the DAS gene is important for the induction of MOX or DAS by methanol, the presence of these regions is required for the expression of MOX or DAS and or for the induction of other enzymes by methanol. Another example might be the removal of the regions to avoid repression by glucose, which is needed for the expression of genes coding for proteins other than MOX and DHAS under influence of the MOX and or DAS regulatory regions with glucose as a carbon source. Inducible gene expression as shown in this specification was known in the art. J.T. Lis c.s. describe in Cell R.L. Brinster c.s. describe in Nature However, the present invention provides an induction in more practical systems enabling a high yield of the polypeptide to be produced. Thus one aspect of the present invention relates to the isolation and complete characterization of the structural genes coding for MOX and DHAS from the yeast Moreover, it relates to combinations of genes coding for alcohol oxidase or other oxidases originating from Furthermore it relates to combinations of the powerful regulon or parts of it and terminaters of the MOX and or DAS and by site directed mutagenesis or other methods changed structural genes coding for alcohol oxidase or another oxidase. These changed structural genes may be located on episomal vectors, in minichromosomes or integrated in the chromosomes of Besides this, the present invention relates to combinations of the regulon and terminater of the MOX and or DAS gene of A very important and preferred embodiment of the invention is a process for preparing a polypeptide, such as a protein or an enzyme, by culturing a microorganism under suitable conditions, optionally concentrating the polypeptide and collecting same in a manner known Surprisingly, it has been observed by the present inventors that the regions concerned, which are shown in Fig. 20 and are referred to herein as the 1000 regions of the MOX and DAS genes, are of crucial importance for the expression of the structural gene concerned. Experiments performed with recombinants containing the MOX regulon from which this region was eliminated showed a low level of expression. Therefore, use of a regulon comprising such 1000 region, or an effective modification thereof, i.e. any modification which does not result in a significant mutilation of the function of said region, makes it possible to realize production of a relatively high amount of the desired polypeptide. A preferred embodiment of this process according to the invention is characterized in that the structural gene concerned has been provided with one or more DNA sequences coding for amino acid sequences involved in the translocation of the gene product into the peroxisomes or equivalent microbodies of the microbial host. Translocation of the produced polypeptide into the peroxisomes or equivalent microbodies improves their stability, which results in a higher yield. For certain kinds of polypeptides, in particular oxidases, such translocation is imperative for survival of the microbial host, i.e. to protect the host against the toxic effects of the hydrogen peroxide produced when the microbial host cells are growing on the substrate of the oxidase. If the oxidase concerned does not contain addressing signals which are functional in the microbial host used in the production process, one should provide the structural gene with sequences coding for host specific addressing signals, for example by adding such sequences or by substituting these for the original addressing sequences of the gene. production of a fused polypeptide, in which the fusion partner carries suitable addressing signals, is another possibility. In case methylotrophic yeasts are used in the production process, it is preferred that the DNA sequences consist of the MOX gene or thos parts thereof which are responsible for MOX translocation into the peroxisomes or microbodies. Finally, this aspect of the present invention is related to the synthesis of MOX originating from Some microorganisms with the potential of producing alcohol oxidases are summarized below. Among the oxidases other than alcohol oxidases, the most interesting are Combinations of the powerful regulons and terminaters of the MOX and DAS genes from The above description is followed by a list of references, claims, Tables, Legends to Figures and Figures.
