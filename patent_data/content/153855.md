# PYRROLIZIDINE DERIVATIVE

## Abstract
A novel pyrrolizidine derivative of the formula, The derivative can be synthesized by acylating 2,6 xylidine to protect the amino group, nitrating the protected xylidine to introduce a nitro group at 3 position, reducing the nitro group to an amino group, followed by diazotizing and hydrolyzing, and then the resulted 3 hydroxy 2,6 dimethyl aniline being condensed with 8 halocarbonylmethyl pyrrolizidine or by nitrating N 2 ,6 dimethyl phenyl 8 pyrrolizidineacetamide to introduce a nitro group at 3 position, reducing the nitro group to amino group, diazotiz ing the amino group and hydrolyzing the diazonium com pound.
