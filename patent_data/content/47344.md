## Description
C L E A N I N G S Y S T E M The invention relates to a cleaning system for difficultly accessible window panes, such as those encountered in tall buildings. Window panes of tall buildings have so far been cleaned at great cost with the aid of expensive travelling and lifting gear capable of directing a cleaners cage along all window panes. Such mechanisms are permanently attached to the building, which in itself entails high costs of investment, quite apart from the continuously high cost of personnel relating to the cleaners who man the cage.The invention aims at providing an improved cleaning system for window panes of difficult access, entailing reduced costs and allowing greater ease of operation.To this end, a cleaning system according to the invention consists of a sprayer and or sweeper fitted on the outside of the window pane and capable of performing an up and down movement, and motor means for driving the movable sprayer and or sweeper, which motor means can be operated from the space on the inside of the window pane, the spraying medium being supplied to the sprayer from the space on the inside. The cleaning operation can thus be performed entirely from inside the building.According to a certain preferred form of embodiment, the sprayer and or sweeper is or are mounted by nut means on at least one vertically arranged screwed rod uhich is driven by the motor means According to the invention, the motor means can efficiently be connected to a coupling projecting on the inside of the window pane, the sprayer being in flow communic tion with a fluid coupling for liquid or air which opens on the inside of the window pane.As a result, it is not necessary to provide a separate motor for each window pane, it being sufficient to provide Just one connectable motor for all window panes, for example a two way portable drill, and the supply of spraying means for all window panes, constituted by liquid and or air, being adequately ensured by just one mobile unit which is equipped with reservoir and pumping means.According to further elaboration of the invention, a sprayer and a sweeper are jointly constituted by flexible hoses, fastened to a spraying tube, through which the spraying medium is squirted onto the window pane, which hoses have such a length as to be capable of touching the window pane.According to the invention, the window pane can furthermore efficiently be provided with a closable opening, extending over the width, through which the sprayer and or sweepers can be mounted and disassembled. The presence of such an opening, besides allowing mounting and disassembly, provides ease of maintenance and repairs from inside the building.In order to clarify the invention, a number of examples of embodiment will be described, reference being made to the drawing.Fig. 1 is an outside view of a window pane provided with a system according to the invention Fig. 2 is a sectional view along the line II II in Fig. 1 Fig. 3 shows the spraying and sweeping system of Fig. 2 in greater detail and on a larger scale Fi . 4 is d sections1 view of the suspension of the spraying and sweeping system of Fig. 1 in greater detail and on e larger scale Fig. 5 is a horizontal section along the line U V in Fig. 4 Fig. 6 shows an example of a compressed air drying me chanism Fig. 7 shows an example of a combined spraying and sweeping mechanism. Fig. 1 and 2 show a window pane 1 which is set in a window frame 2. On the upper side, extending over the width, is a longitudinal opening 3 allowing communica tion between the inside and the outside of the window pane, so that mounting, disassembling, maintenance and repair operations at the sprayer or the sweeper can be carried out from inside the building. The opening 3 can be closed with a cover 4, which may include, for example, an air vent not shown . The member 6 is a combined wiper and sprayer, which will be explained in further detail with the aid of Fig. 3. This member 6 is suspended on one side with the use of a sleeve shaped nut 7 from a screwed rod 8, which can be driven through a gearbox 8 by a spindle 11. A loose, two way portable drill not shown can be coupled up with this spindle. The other side of the memeber 6 is freely guided in a channel section 12. For the supply of cleaning liquid and or air, the member 6 is in flow communication with a connecting nipple 13, to which a reservoir and pump unit not shown can be connected for supplying compressed liquid and or air. The flow connection consists of the fixed line 14 which starts at the nipple 13 and the upper end of which connects to a flexible hose 16, which can form a moving loop during up and down movement of the member 6.Fig. 3 shows the box type design of the member 6 in transverse section. The box comprises two compartments, in one of which a spring loaded wiper blade 17 is mounted.The other compartment, connected to the flexible hose 16, is provided with spray holes 18 directed towards the glass 1. Depending on the circumstances, it is evidently possible to supply cleaning liquid, air, or a mixture of the two.Figs. 4 and 5 again show, on an enlarged scale, the suspension of the member 6 from the screwed rod 8. The sleeve shaped nut 7, which may be manufactured of a substance such as nylon, possesses a projecting sheet 19 with mounting holes 21, with which the member 6 can be detachably fastened to this projecting sheet.Thus, when the member 6 is brought before the opening 3, this member can be transferred to the inside of the building for a variety of purposes.Fig 6 is a transverse sectional view of a variant of a spraying and drying mechanism 22.Fig. 7 is a transverse sectional view of a variant of a spraying and sweeping mechanism 23. Flexible tubes 25 which abut against the glass are connected to the pipe 24. When cleaning liquid and or air are or is being squeezed out, the flexibility of these spray tubes causes them to flutter violently, as a result of which they act as brushes in the case of liquid, and produce a wiper effect in the case of air.Clearly the invention is not restricted to the examples of embodiment described, but also extends to, for example, a combination of the spraying and sweeping members illustrated ans specified. An embodiment of the type shown in Fig. 7 likewise falls within the scope of the invention uhe n it i s 60 modified that, instead of flexible tubes 5, flexible strips such as leather cords or strings arranged near the sprayer orifices similarly perform the fluttering sweeping motion as a result of the emergence of liquid and or air jets. It is furthermore within the scope of the invention for the motor means to be accommodated in the opening 3. It is furthermore possible, within the realm of the invention,in stead of, or besides, the with the sweeping means up and down movin spraying means, to mount spraying menas fixedly to the edges of the window pane
