# Reversible plough.

## Abstract
A reversible plough has a double acting hydraulic ram 6 connected between the headstock and the reversing spindle 4 to reverse the plough frame from a left handed to a right handed ploughing position, and vice versa. Hy draulically operating mechanism is provided in the head stock both to switch the flow of hydraulic fluid from one to the other end of the double acting ram 6 and to apply ad ditional reversing torque to the spindle 4 at the midway position. The mechanism comprises two hydraulic cylinders 9, 10 acting upon a fork 12 pivotally mounted in the headstock and engaging with a roller 26 spaced radially of the spindle 4 . As the midway position is approached, the roller 26 displaces the fork 12 from a rest position whereupon the fork is rotated by the cylinders 9, 10 to drive the reversing spindle 4 through the midway position. Internal fluid pathways in the two cylinders 9, 10 effect the change of fluid flow to the double acting ram 6 .
