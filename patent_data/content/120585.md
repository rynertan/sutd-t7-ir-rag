## Description
This invention relates to new fused heterocyclic compounds, more particularly to fused heterocyclic compounds having a selective action on H2 histamine receptors and which inhibit gastric acid secretion, to processes for their preparation and to pharmaceutical compositions containing them. It has been postulated that the physiologically active compound histamine, which occurs naturally within the animal body, is able to combine, in the course of exerting its activity, with certain specific raceptors of which there are at least two distinct and separate types. The first has been named the H1 receptor Ash and Schild, Brit. J. Pharmac., 196E, 27, 427 and the action of histamine at this receptor is blocked antagonized by classical antihistamine drugs such as mepyramine pyrilamine . The second histamine receptor has been named the H2 receptor 8lack et al.,Nature, 1972, 236, 385 and the action of histamine at this receptor is blocked by drugs such as cimetidine.It is known that one of the results of the blockage of the action of histamine at the H2 receptor is the inhibition of the secretion of gastric acid and a compound which possesses this ability is therefore useful in the treatment of peptic ulcers and other conditions caused or exacerbated by gastric acidity, including stress. ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding due to trauma. The commercialization of cimetidine and subsequent follow up pharmacological research in patients has demonstrated that cimetidine is a drug with limitations, such as short duration of action, anti androgenic activity, and a tendency to cause confusional states in elderly patients. Obviously, much intensive research has been carried out to find improved H2 antagonists. Indeed, selective H2 antagonists having greater activity than cimetidine have been discovered. Among the better known newH2 antagonists are ranitidine disclosed in U.S. PatentNo. 4,128,658 having the structure EMI2.1 tiotidine U.S. Patent No. 4,165,378 having the structure EMI2.2 and compounds such as those disclosed in EuropeanPatent Application 24,510 having the structure EMI3.1 wherein R4 is among others, hydrogen, methyl or methylol and those disclosed in U.K. Patent No. 2,067,987 having the structure EMI3.2 The present invention provides a novel group of compounds, with potent H2 receptor antagonist activity, having the following formula EMI4.1 wherein B is a moiety having the formula EMI4.2 the dotted line represents a bond which is present whenB is formula Id or If and absent when B is formula Ie, R is hydrogen, mono or dihalo,aminol nitro,cyano, hydroxy trifluoromethyl, mercapto, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, alkanoyl, lowercycloalkyl, carboxy, alkoxycarbonyl, mono or di lower alkyl substituted amino, alkanoylamino, lower alkyl thio1 loweralkyl sulfonyl, sulfamoyl, lower alkyl substituted sulfamoyl, phenyl or phenyl substituted with halo, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, trifluoromethyl, hydroxy, amino, cyano or nitro X is SO2, SO, S or C O and A is an amine of formula EMI4.3 wherein n is 1 to 4 R1 is hydrogen or R2CH2 wherein R2 is mono or diloweralkylamino, mono or di N loweralkylamino lower alkyl, 2 furyl methylamino, benzylamino, lower cycloalkylamino of 5 to 7 carbon atoms, 1 pyrrolidinyl, 1 piperidinyl, 1 hexahydroazepinyl, 1 octahydroazocinyl, 3 thiazolidinyl, 4 morpholinyl or 4 thiomorpholinyl R3 is hydrogen or 1 piperidinyl methyl with the proviso that when R3 is 1 piperidinyl methyl, thenR1 is hydrogen and the pharmacologically acceptable salts thereof. The term halo refers to fluoro, chloro and bromo.The terms lower alkyl and lower alkoxy refer to moieties having 1 6 carbon atoms in the carbon chain.The term alkanoyl refers to the moiety RaCO whereinRais an alkyl group having 1 4 carbon atoms. The term lower cycloalkyl refers to cyclic structures having 5 to 7 carbon atoms. Preferred values are i A has formula Ic or Ia, ii B has formula Ie, iii R3 is hydrogen, iv n is 3, v RÚ is RêCH where Rê is 1 piperidinyl, and or vi X is S02. In general the compounds of formula I are prepared by building up the molecule from appropriate reactive precursors. For example the compounds of the invention can be readily prepared by reacting a 3 alkylthio derivative of an appropriate thienoisothiazole starting material with the desired amine according to the following reaction sequence EMI6.1 where the dotted line, B, R, X and A are as hereinbefore defined and hal represents a halogen.

Processes b and c may be carried out in an inert solvent such as an alkanol, acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, acetone and the like if desired with heating. Preferably the reaction is conducted in the presence of base which acts as acid acceptor. Suitable bases include for example NaOH, KOH,LiOH, triethylamine, dimethylaniline, sodium ethoxide and the like. When Y is OH in the compounds of formulae III or VI or VIb then the reaction is carried out in the presence of a mineral acid e.g. concentrated HCl. Processes d , e and 51 may be carried out using a hydride transfer agent to effect reductive amination, e.g. an alkali metal borohydride such as sodium boro hydride, and in an inert solvent, e.g. an alkanol such as ethanol.

When Y is OH in the compounds of formulae VIII, VIlla or XI then processes g , k and h may be carried out in the presence of a nickel catalyst such as Raney nickel e.g. Raney nickel W2. An organic solvent which is inert under the reaction conditions, is usually used, for example xylene, toluene or benzene. Preferably the reaction is carried out by heating the reactants under reflux in a water immiscible organic solvent, e.g. xylene, and removing the water formed during reaction by azeotropic distillation. If necessary reactive substituent groups can be blocked during reaction and released later. Process i is carried out by standard procedures known in the art for converting an amine function to a guanidine function, e.g. using urea, thiourea, cyanamide or a regent of formulaEMI16.1 where L1 is a halogen, alkyl or S alkoxy For example the reaction with an S alkyl isothioures may be effected by heating the reactants in a suitable solvent, e.g. acetonitrile or an alkanol. Process j may be carried out using standard procedures well known in the art for effecting the Mannich reaction.

Compounds of formula III can be prepared by reacting a compound of formula II with a corresponding amine of formula NH2 CH2 n Y Y XII Compounds of formula IVa and IVb may be prepared by treating the corresponding chloro methyl analogues with NaSH. Similarly compounds of formula V may be prepared by reacting corresponding compounds of formula III whereY is halogen, e.g. chlorine, with NaSH. Compounds of formula VIa and VIb wherein Y is a leaving group may be prepared for example from the corresponding alcohols by conventional means. Compounds of formula VIIa, VIIc and VIld may be prepared by reacting the appropriate compound of formula III wherein Y is chloro with 3 or 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde or 5 mercapto methylfuran 2 carboxaldehyde in the manner of process b . Compounds of formulae VIII, VIIIa and XI may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula II with the appropriate amine starting materials wherein Y is OH in the manner of process a and if desired converting the hydroxy group to a leaving group by conventional means. Similarly compounds of formulae IX and X may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula II with an appropriate compound of formulaEMI18.1 in the manner of process a . Once a compound of formula I having a reactive substituent group has been prepared then that compound may be converted in known manner to other compounds of formula I. For example when R is a lower alkoxy substituent dealkylation produces a corresponding compound of formula I wherein R is a hydroxy substituent.When R is nitro then reduction, e g. using ammonium su lp hide can convert the nitro group to an amino group.Such amino groups may be acylated. In any of the aforementioned processes reactive substituent groups may be blocked and released at a later stage. The compounds of the invention readily form pharmacologically acceptable salts with both inorganic and organic acids, such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, nitric, phosphoric, acetic, maleic, fumaric, citric and the like. The compounds of the invention have histamine H2 blocking activity and can be used in the treatment of. conditions where there is hypersecretion of gastric acid, such as in gastric and peptic ulceration, and other conditions caused or exacerbated by gastric acidity such as stress ulceration or gastric intestinal bleeding due to trauma. The compounds of the invention can be administered orally or parenterally or by suppository, of which the preferred route is the oral route. They may be used in the form of the base or as a pharmacologically acceptable salt. They will in general be associated with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent, to provide a pharmaceutical composition. Accordingly this invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula I or a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The compounds of the invention can be administered in combination with other active ingredients, e.g. conventional antihistamines if required. For oral administration the pharmaceutical composition can most conveniently be in the form of capsules or tablets, which may be slow release tablets. The composition may also take the form of a dragee or may be in syrup form. A convenient daily dose by the oral route would be of the order of 100 mg to 1.2 9 per day, in the form or dosage units containing from 20 to 200 mg per dosage unit. A convenient regimen in the case of a slow release tablet would be twice or three times a day. Parenteral administration may be by injections at intervals or as a continuous infusion. Injection solutions may contain from 10 to 100 mg ml of active ingredient.

Individual contractions are recorded with a force displacement transducer through a strain gauge coupler. A control dose response curve to histamine in the above described tissue bath is obtained after which the tissue is washed three times and allowed to re equilibrate to basal rate.The test compound is added to the tissue bath at the desired final concentration. Thirty minutes after addition of the compound, a fresh histamine dose response curve is again obtained. Then the response to histamine in the presence of antagonist is compared to the histamine control response. This procedure is repeated, using fresh tissues, for each concentration of antagonist tested. The result is expressed as the apparent dissociation constant pA2 of the H2 antagonist as determined by standard procedures. Cimetidine is used as the standard for this test. The results for a series of compounds of the invention are as follows Compound or Example No. PA2 Value Cimetidine 6.5 1 1.0 x 10 9M 2 1.0 x 10 M 3 5.94 x 10 M These values are the K B values for the compounds tested, and the K B differs from the A2 value only by the fact that the A2 value reflects the results of three experiments, while the K B value represents the result of only one experiment. The results show that the compounds of the invention are extremely active H2 antagonists, being significantly more active than the standard compound cimetidine.
