# APPARATUS FOR SCRAMBLING AND UNSCRAMBLING SIGNALS

## Abstract
An apparatus for scrambling raster scan lines of a multip lex analogue component television signal having luminance and chrominance sections in analogue form comprises a writ ing means W1 , a luminance store 4 and a chrominance store 5 , and a reading means R1 . A controlling means 6 controls the writing means W1 so that the luminance section of the signal is written into the luminance store 4 and the chrominance section is written into the chrominance store 5 . The controlling means 6 then controls the reading means R1 to produce a scrambled signal in which one of the analogue sections is divided into a plurality of information blocks which are separated by at least a part of the other analogue section. An unscrambling apparatus for unscrambl ing the signal scrambled by the above apparatus comprises a writing means W3 which is controlled by a controlling means 15 to write the luminance information blocks into a luminance store 17 and the chrominance information into a chrominance store 18 . A reading means R4 is controlled by the controlling means 15 to read out the stores 17, 18 to provide undivided sections of analogue chrominance and luminance information.
