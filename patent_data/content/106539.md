# Voltage regulating system for an electrical generator.

## Abstract
A voltage regulating system for a generator 10 that supplies the battery and electrical loads on a motor vehicle includes a load response control 40 for detecting whenever a substantial electrical load is applied to the generator tending to cause a drop in generator output voltage when such a condition is detected, generator field current is controlled to gradually increase the field current from its prevailing value. The load response control includes means 164 for storing an electrical signal that corresponds to generator field current and for utilizing this stored value to set generator field current at a value corresponding to the value of field current that occurred just prior to the detected drop in voltage, and then increase the field current slowly from this value. The system also includes means 190, 192 for preventing a subsequent drop in detected load voltage from actuating the load response control during the period that field current is being slowly increased by the load response control once it has been triggered by an initial drop in voltage.
