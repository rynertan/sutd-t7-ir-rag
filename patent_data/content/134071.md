# Pressure operated switch for a high voltage interrupting module.

## Abstract
An improved switch for a high voltage device in which ignition of a power cartridge moves an insulative piston lacated in a conductive member, into a passageway formed in a insulative liner, said piston moving a contact through the passageway and away from the conductive member to break an electrical intercon nection between the conductive member and the movable con tact and to form a gap therebetween, thereby opening the switch the bore and the passageway being aligned, the piston being made of a material which is more rigid and less easy to deform than the material of the liner upon the application, at a given rate, of a given load, and the size of the piston being greater than the size of the passageway.
