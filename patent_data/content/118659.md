# Apparatus and method for coating particulate material with binder resin prior to forming particle board.

## Abstract
An apparatus is disclosed for the continuous dispensing and blending of a fluid material with a particulate material in predetermined quantities. A master control is provided for synchronizing the startup and interruption of the systems for furnishing the particulate material and the fluid material and for operation of the blending apparatus, thereby facilitating the continuous operation thereof. The system is particularly adapted for use in the coating of wood furnish with binder adhesive prior to the pressing and heating of the wood furnish to form particle boards and the like.
