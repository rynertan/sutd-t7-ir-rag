## Description
Fitted up vessel for the prompt preparation of diluted liquid detergents, by starting from concentrated detergent single dose containers. This invention relates to the liquid detergents for dish washing, and more particularly to a fitted up vessel for the extemporaneous preparation of diluted liquid detergents at the dilution of use, by starting from concentrated detergent packages. The liquid detergents for domestic use presently on the market are marketed in bottles of plastics, as a diluted product ready to be used. This marketing system has several drawbacks, some of which are a Expensive package b Expensive transport, as generally the diluting water is over 80 of the transported load c Waste of material, as the bottle is used only once, and resulting greater pollution. U.S. Patent No. 3,968,820 describes a mixing container for dissolving corrosive or poisonous chemicals, supplied in a sealed package, in a solvent.The container comprises a filling neck, which can be closed by a lid, for the chemicals, more particularly for the production of a plant protective spraying liquid, characterized by the following features.The filling neck is provided with a sleeve extension, directed towards the interior of the container, for receiving an as yet unopened chemical capsule.The sleeve extension in the interior part has cutting knife, the cutting edge of which extends completely across said extension, so that upon said capsule being pressed by means of a pressing punch insertable into said neck against said knife edge, said knife slices completely through said capsule in a manner that said capsule can pass said knife and move into said vessel. The above prior art device is rather complicated.Moreover, the fact that the sliced capsule is caused to move into the vessel is very objectionable. It is therefore the object of this invention to overcome the inconveniences of the known systems for preparing and marketing liquid detergents for domestic use. According to a feature of this invention, this object is attained by packaging a concentrated detergent into single dose containers being suitable for preparing a pre established volume of final product, and by suppling the user with a vessel for the diluting liquid, provided with a device for opening easily said single dose containers and for pouring their contents into the diluting liquid previously poured into said vessel, whilst preventing said emptied containers from dropping into the said vessel. Generally, the said diluting liquid is water from a city water supply system. Advantageously, said single dose containers are in form of pots made of a plastics foil, or of plastics coated paper, or of any other suitable material, and are sealed by an easily tearable sheet material, such as an aluminum foil. According to one preferred embodiment of this invention, the said vessel is in the form of a cylindrical bottle, and said device for opening and emptying the said single dose containers is accomodated within the top portion or neck of the bottle. The fitted up vessel according to the invention is advantageously provided with a screw plug, and by a partial rotation thereof a port setting into communication the interior of the vessel with a pouring spout provided thereon, will be opened or closed. Further features and advantages of this invention will be more clearly apparent in the course of the following detailed description of one preferred embodiment thereof, which is made with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein Figure 1 is an elevational view showing a fitted up vessel according to the invention Figure 2 is a partly sectioned side elevational view of the vessel shown in Figure 1 Figure 3 is an exploded view of the vessel shown inFigures 1 and 2 and Figure 4 is an elevational view, in an enlarged scale, showing a concentrated detergent single dose container, to be used in combination with the vessel shown in Figures 1 to 3. Referring to the drawings, and referring particularly to Figure 3 of same, the fitted up vessel of the invention essentially consist of a body 1 with a neck portion 2 on which there is forcibly snap fitted a ring nut 3 carrying therewithin a piercing element 4, and which is provided with an internally screw threaded opening 5 and a pouring spout 6, and with a screw plug 7 that is susceptible of being threadedly engaged with the screw threads in opening 5. The body 1 is substantially cylindrically shaped, and has two built in wide lateral recesses 101 oriented according to the directrices of the cylindrical body 1, and cooperating with each other and with a piece 201 slightly jutting out of body I, so as to form a handle for gripping the vessel. Placed over the body I is a cylindrical neck portion 2 which next to its top end is encircled by an outwardly projecting rib 102 having in cross section a saw tooth profile. That portion of neck 2 which lies under the rib 102 is provided with a series of close grooves 202 cut according to the directrices of the cylindrical neck 2, and extending downward over a height corresponding approximately to 2 3 of the neck 2, whereby a so called knurled coupling is thus formed. The cylindrical ring nut 3 has an annular groove 103 cut in the median area of its inner skirt, and the profile of said groove is complementary to the profile of the rib 102 on neck 2 of the vessel body 1. The inner skirt of ring nut 3 is provided in the region lying under the annular groove 103 with a series of close grooves 203 cut according to the directrices of the ring nut 3 cylindrical skirt, and costituting the complementary member of the knurled coupling 202 in the vessel neck 2.At its upper section, the ring nut 3 is provided on its inner skirt with a quick pitch multi start screw thread 5, and also with a pouring spout 6, located in correspondence of said screw threaded zone. Accomodated and supported within the ring nut 3 is a piercing element generally designated by numeral 4, which comprises a pyramidal truss like structure consisting of a set of small rods 104 that start from a base ring 204 being flush with the bottom plane of ring nut 3, and extend as far as the apex 304 lying substantially at the same level as the top plane of ring nut 3, and is co axial thereto. The base ring 204 has a sensibly smaller diameter than the inside diameter of ring nut 3, and its provided at its bottom with an annular flange 404. The outside diameter of flange 404 is appreciably smaller than the inside diameter of ring nut 3, so that it is possible to snugly fit the ring nut 3 on the vessel 1 neck 202 provided with the rib 102.Starting from the periphery of the annular flange 404 is a set of strips 504 that extend in the upward direction at the interior of ring nut 3, with a slight outward inclination toward the inner skirt of ring nut 3, as far as a holding ring 604 situated at a level directly over the groove 103. Through an annular flange 704, the ring 604 is connected to the inner skirt of ring nut 3. The disclosed vessel is completed with a plug 7 having a cylindrical body provided with an outer screw thread 107 which is adapted for being engaged with the screw thread 5 on the mouth portion of ring nut 3, and with a knurled top end portion 207. Having so described the fitted up vessel of the invention, the concentrated detergent single dose container will be now disclosed by referring to Figure 4 of the drawings. Referring particularly to Figure 4, there is shown a single dose container which comprises a cylindrical body 8 having its one end closed by a convex end cap 9, and its other end provided with a radially outwardly projecting annular flange 10. A suitable sheet of an easily tearable material 11, such as an aluminum foil, is stretched on flange 10, and is secured thereto such as, for example, by heat welding or by glueing. Subh a sheet material forms the tearable closure of the single dose container 8. The single dose container 8 is made from a plastics foil. The inside diameter of container 8 is slightly greater than the outside diameter of the base ring 204 of the piercing element 4, and the flange 10 is so sized that it can rest on the flange 404 of the piercing element 4, as will be more clearly described hereinafter, the height of container 8 being slightly greater than the height of the piercing element 4, so that the container 8 can be accomodated in the ring nut 3 hollow space which at its bottom is bounded by the flange 404, and at its top is bounded by the bottom of plug 7, any time this plug is fully screwed down on the ring nut 3.The disclosed fitted up vessel is preferably made of plastics, more particularly, the body 1 is preferably made of transparent plastics, while the ring nut 3 and the plug 7 are preferably made of opaque or dulled plastics. Referring particularly to Figure 2 of the drawings, we will now describe how the elements forming the fitted up vessel of the invention are to be assembled, and how this vessel should be used. To mount the ring nut 3 onto the body 1, this ring nut is forcibly fitted on the neck 2 as far as to have b g b 102 snappingly inserted into the annular groove 103 in ring nut 3. During the step of mounting the ring nut 3 onto the body 1, care should be taken that the spout 6 be oriented in the direction diametrically opposite to the direction in which extends the handle portion 201, as shown in Figures 1 to 3. Thanks to the provision of the knurled coupling 202 203, any relative rotation of the ring nut 3 and the neck 2 of the vessel body 1 is prevented, whereby the required orientation of spout 6 will be maintained. At this point, the fitted up vessel is ready to be used. In use, the vessel 1 will be filled with water up to a suitable level marking 12 made on the vessel body 1, and a single dose container 8 will be then introduced into the hollow space in ring nut 3, with the closure sheet 11 of container 8 being caused to rest on the apex of the piercing element 4, and this container 8 will be pressed downward as far as to have its flange 10 bearing against the piercing element flange 404 position shown in Figure 2 . In the course of this operation, the piercing element 4 will tear apart the closure sheet 11, and the concentrated detergent contained in the singledose container 8 will then flow down entirely into the underlying vessel 1 and will be dissolved in the water contained therewithin, thus giving rise to the solution of detergent 13 ready to be used.At this point, the plug 7 will be fully screwed down on the top portion of ring nut 3. With the plug 7 fully screwed down, as shown in Figure 2, the fitted up vessel is closed, and its contents cannot be poured out for being used. To pour out the liquid detergent 13, it is sufficient to partly unscrew the plug 7, so as to open a port setting into communication the pouring spout 6 with the hollow in the fitted up vessel. Once all of the liquid 13 has been used, the plug 7 will be unscrewed, the exhausted single dose container 8 will be removed, and the body 1 will be again filled with water up to the level marking 12, whereupon a new container 8 will be introduced and pressed against the piercing element 4, thus producing again a fresh dose of liquid detergent 13 ready to be used. Of course, the described and shown embodiment is only a preferred construction of the invention, it being understood that the advantages of this invention may spread to any models affording like benefits and using the same novel conception. Therefore, instead of consisting of a truss like structure, the piercing element 4 may, for example, be in form of one or more intersecting triangular blades, or of a compounded structure. Similarly, the way of fixing and holding up the piercing element 4 onto the ring nut 3 may be altered. Moreover, also the way of attaching the ring nut 3 to the neck 2 may be changed and, for example, provisions may be made for fixing the ring nut 3 to the neck 2 by glueing, instead of resorting to the type of engagement by the snapfitting means 102 103, and to the type of connection by the knurled coupling 202 203. Of course, although in the foregoing specification reference has been made mainly to detergents, it should be understood that the fitted up vessel of the invention can be used with other products, such as auxiliary products for washing purposes, or the like.
