# Direct imaging method and electrostatic printing equipment.

## Abstract
A direct printing method in which a recording electrode 1 and a magnetic brush developer electrode 17 face one another on opposite sides of a recording medium 3 . A gap d is provided between electrode 1 and the recording medium 3 , for example by an uneven surface of the recording medium 3 facing the electrode 1 . By a discharge across this gap, charges 7 are adhered to the surface facing electrode 1 . These charges 7 hold toner powder 5 to the other surface of the recording medium 3 . A toner image formed on recording medium 3 may be transferred to recording paper 12 . After transfer, toner remaining on the recording medium is discharged, for example by a preclean corona 21 , and discharge toner magnetically attracted from the recording medium for return to a toner supply.
