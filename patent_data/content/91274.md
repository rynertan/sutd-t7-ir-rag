# Electronic counting scale.

## Abstract
Samples each consisting of the same number of device are weighed on the scale pan 11 and a provisional average weight determined. Subsequently an unknown additional number of items are weighed and their number determined by dividing by the provisional average weight. To eliminate the possibility of a unit error the number of added items is limited. A ROM 24 contains programs for calculating by statistical methods the maximum addable number. If this is equalled or exceeded the display 4 indicates that fact to the operator.
