# METHOD OF MAKING SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE

## Abstract
A semiconductor device having phosphosilicate glass layer 6 is improved by adopting a new structure having a thin silicon nitride film 9 of a thickness lower than 3000 Ã… provided under such place that is to be covered by the phosphosilicate glass 6. The phosphosilicate glass 6 is subject to softening after necessary selective etching. Undesirable oxidation of silicon layer 4 at the part under the phosphosilicate glass film in a thermal treatment for the softening is suppressed. Accordingly, in a MOS IC, which uses polycrystalline silicon film 4 as gate electrode and as wiring conductors, the silicon nitride film 9 is formed to cover the polycrystalline silicon films 4, thereby undesirable oxidation of surface of the polycrystalline silicon film 4 is prevented, thereby shrink of pattern and or forming of undesirable silicon oxide film around the gate electrode or wiring conductors are prevented.
