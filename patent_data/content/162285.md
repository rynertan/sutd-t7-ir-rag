# Curved surface formation polishing apparatus.

## Abstract
A curved surface formation polishing apparatus for ro tationally symmetrical objects such as optical lenses, mirrors, etc., which is so arranged that, by relatively displacing a proc essing tool 10 and a workpiece 15 in a direction generally intersecting at right angles with a rotary axis of the process ing tool 10 mounted on a rotating spindle 11 so as to follow a predetermined curved surface cross section shape, grind ing loci at a processing point of the workpiece formed by an abrasive grain cutting edge of the processing tool may over lap each other through crossing as the processing proceeds, thus realizing a favorable finished surface. Moreover, ac cording to another embodiment of the present invention, since it is so arranged that, with more than two processing tools 10B1,10B2 mounted on the same rotary axis, there is provided a device for displacing the processing tools in the direction of the rotary axis so as to change over the proc essing tools according to end uses and processing steps, such change over of the processing tools is facilitated, while it becomes possible to suppress deterioration in the accuracy of the processed shape by setting errors of the processing tools, with a simultaneous simplification of construction of the apparatus and reduction in cost for an improved mass productivity.
