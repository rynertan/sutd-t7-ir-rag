# Span adjustment in electronic weighing apparatus.

## Abstract
There is provided a system for adjusting the span of an electronic scale having a double integrating A D convertor for converting a weight signal into a digital signal. The double integrating A D converter has a software implemented timer for controlling a primary integrating time. The operation time of the software implemented timer is adjusted linearly or in steps so that a digital value at the time a weight is placed on the scalepan of the scale will correspond to that expected for the weight. The adjustment of the operation time of the software implemented timer can also be utilized to adjust easily for differences between gravitational accelerations cor responding to different weights in geometrical areas on the earth.
