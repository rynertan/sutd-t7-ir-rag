# AUTOMATIC TIME DOMAIN EQUALIZATION OF AUDIO SIGNALS

## Abstract
An apparatus for modifying the audio response of a sound reproduction system, particularly in the form of an improved audio equalizer comprising a discrete time filter connected in the sound reproduction system. Means are provided for introducing an electrical test signal into a first point in the sound reproduction system, typically at the input of an electroacoustic transducer. Means, such as a mic rophone, are provided for detecting at a predetermined location the acoustic output produced by the transducer of the sound reproduction system in response to the test signal. The qualizer includes means for generating a sampled sequence of signals from the detected acoustic output of the sound reproduction system. Means are provided for generat ing from the sequence of signals, coefficients of the discrete time filter and the tap locations or time slots of the respective coefficients. Means are also included for storing those coefficients and time slots or locations in appropriate order together with the addresses at which they are stored.
