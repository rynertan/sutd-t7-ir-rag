# Methods and apparatus for erecting tray type cartons.

## Abstract
In the erection of rectangular tray type cartons 110 from blanks 10 of foldable sheet material, corner tabs 201 which are to be uppermost in the erected carton are first folded up from the plane of the balnk, which is then passed through a die 54 by a punch 52 to form the side wall 24 . On completion of the stroke of the punch, the pair of opposed elongate panels 181 which carry the uppermost tabs 201 are folded out wardly by folding bars 58 carried by the punch. The partially erected carton 42 is then transferred to a continuously mov ing conveyor 43 and the other pair of elongate panels 18 are folded outwardly by oscillating fingers 70 and plough bars 74 . The upstanding tabs 201 are then heated by travelling hot air jets and pressed down by pressure rollers 46 to seal them to the other tabs 20 and complete the horizontal peripheral flange 28 which extends continuously around the carton.
