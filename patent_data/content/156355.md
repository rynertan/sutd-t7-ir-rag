## Description
This invention is in the field of biochemical engineering. More particularly it relates to a process forcultivating heterologous protein producing recombinant cells such that the yield of the heterologous proteinis improved. Synthetic and chemically defined media for cultivating microorganisms are well known. Conventionalnutrient media for cultivating bacteria have been used to grow recombinant bacteria that are capable ofproducing heterologous polypeptides. See, for instance, European patent application 81301227.5 publishedunder number 0036776 on September 30, 1981 . Casamino acids have been included in such nutrientmedia throughout the cultivation period. Ethanol is known to have various effects on The invention concernsthe embodiments characterized in the claims. In the drawings As used herein, the term heterologous refers to polypeptides not produced by wild type bacteria. Theheterologous polypeptides that are made by the invention process will typically have industrial, agricultural,or health care utility. In most instances, the polypeptides will be nonbacterial polypeptides that have aminoacid sequences that are substantially identical to eukaryotic cell proteins or viral proteins. In this regard, theterm substantially identical means that the amino acid sequences of the microbially produced syntheticpolypeptide and the native polypeptide are either identical or differ by one or more amino acid alterations deletions, additions, substitutions that do not cause an adverse functional dissimilarity between thesynthetic polypeptide and its native counterpart. Hydrophobic polypeptides of 15 30 Kd molecular weighthaving human lymphokine activity e.g., IFN α activity, IFN β activity, IFN γ activity, colony stimulatingfactor CSF activity, tumor necrosis factor activity, interleukin IL 1, IL 2, or IL 3 activity lymphotoxinactivity are of particular interest. For convenience, such polypeptides are referred to herein by their nativedesignations e.g., IFN α, IFN β, etc. regardless of whether they are identical chemically to the nativepolypeptide. The recombinant bacteria that are used in the invention may be made by recombinant DNA techniques.These techniques typically involve i cloning a synthetic structural gene or a structural gene of genomicorigin that encodes the heterologous polypeptide into an appropriate plasmid or viral expression vector at asite which permits expression thereof i.e., at a site controlled by a promoter operator, a ribosome bindingsite for the translation of the transcribed mRNA, and a translation start codon in the same translationalreading frame as the structural gene , ii introducing the vector into competent bacteria, and iii selectingrecombinant cells also called transformants either by a plasmid marker function or their ability toproduce the heterologous polypeptide. The heterologous polypeptide producing transformants are cultivated in a liquid nutrient medium. Themedium comprises an excess of conventional nutrient materials that fulfill the cellular growth requirementsof the bacteria, thereby enabling the bacteria to grow and multiply to a predetermined cellular density. Suchmaterials will include sources of carbon and nitrogen for synthesis of cellular comoonents and energy, andminerals ions such as sulfur SO The yield enhancement achieved by the invention method is particularly pronounced when a lowinoculum concentration is used in the cultivation. In this regard, the inoculum concentration will typically bein the range of 0.1 to 10 mg per liter, more usually about 0.1 to 1 mg per liter. Expressed in terms ofinoculum volume per final volume of fermentation medium the inoculum concentration will usually be 0.1 to10 v v , more usually 0.1 to 1 v v . Important environmental factors affecting the cultivation include pH and temperature. The temperature will range between the minimum and maximum growth temperatures. Most bacteria exhibit maximumgrowth over a fairly narrow temperature range. For mesophilic bacterial such as If the expression of the gene encoding the heterologous polypeptide is under the control of arepressible expression control sequence and it is desired to repress expression of that gene until apredetermined level of growth is achieved, the nutrient medium will also contain an appropriate repressor.For instance, if expression is under the control of the tryptophan trp promoter operator, expression may becontrolled by adding tryptophan to the medium. An excess of trypthophan may be adder initially and thenremoved from the medium when the desired level of cellular growth has been achieved. Alternativelytryptophan is added in a predetermined amount that is correlated to the volume of nutrient medium and theapproximate amount of tryptophan that would theoretically be in the cell mass in the volume at the desiredlevel of growth. In the presence of excess preferred carbon source, such as glucose, the bacteria will usethe tryptophan in the medium rather than producing it themselves for use in the production of cellularprotein. While added tryptophan is present the bacteria repress expression of the heterologous polypeptideunder the control of the trp promoter operator. By initially adding a proper amount of tryptophan to themedia the bacteria may be grown to a predetermined cellular density with the trp operator repressed. Inorder to determine this amount the volume of the medium must be known or determined, the amount oftryptophan per unit dry weight of the bacterial protein is determined experimentally or from publishedsources for The alkanol and or amino acid mixture are added to the nutrient medium curing the terminal portion ofthe cultivation. The exact point in the cultivation at which these materials are added is not critical. In termsof the extent of bacterial growth, the alkanol and or amino acid mixture will usually be added when thecellular density as measured in optical tensity OD units by a spectrophotometer at 680 nm is at leastabout 2 OD units, preferably at least about 10 OD units. In instances where the expression of the geneencoding the polypeptide has been repressed, it is preferred to add the alkanol and or amino acid mixtureduring the expression phase of the cultivation i.e., the phase following derepression of the operator throughremoval or exhaustion of the repressor . The duration of the growth period after the alkanol amino acicmixture is added may vary depending upon the particular bacteria, heterologous polypeptide, and cultivationconditions. Its duration will normally be in the range of about 1 to 5 hours. The cellular density at harvestwill usually be in the range of 10 to 40 OD units, more usually 20 to 40 OD units. The alkanols that may be used in the process are soluble in the aqueous nutrient medium and are nottoxic to the bacteria at the concentrations at which they are added to the medium. These alkanols contain 1 4carbon atoms and may be branched or straight chain. Preferred alkanols are straight chain methanol,ethanol, n propanol, and n butanol . Ethanol is particularly preferred. The amount of alcohol added willtypically be in the range of about 0.5 to 5 v v , preferably 1 to 3 . Mixtures of amino acids for use insupplementing the bacterial growth media are available commercially. These mixtures are typically proteinhydrolysates that are made by subjecting naturally occurring proteinaceous materials, such as casein,soybean meal, lactalalbumin, animal tissue, and gelatin, to acid or enzymatic digestion. Alternatively,mixtures of amino acids may be made up from pure amino acid stocks. When the expression of the gene isunder the control of the trp promoter operator, the mixture of amino acids should lack tryptophan. Acid hydrolyzedcasein lacks tryptophan and is accordingly preferred for such systems. The amount of aminoacid mixture added to the nutrient medium will usually be in the range of about 0.5 to 5 w v ,preferably 1 to 3 . The alkanol and amino acids may be added to the nutrient medium separately orcombined. After harvest, the cells are processed to recover the neterologous polypeptide. This processing willnormally involve disrupting the cells, separating crude heterologous polypeptide from bacterial proteins viaone or more extraction steps, solubilizing the polypeptide depending upon its hydrophobicity and furtherpurifying the polypeptide by gel filtration, high performance liquid chromatography or other proteinpurification procedures. Human lymphokines such as IFN β and IL 2 that are made by recombinant bacteriaare preferably recovered from the cellular material in a reduded state and then oxidized to their nativeconfiguration. The following examples futher describe the materials and techniques used in carrying out the invention. IFN β IFN β At late exponential phase inoculum from this culture 4 was transferred to new flasks containing asimilar medium minus tryptophan and with varying amounts of ethanol. At the end of growth as estimatedby turbidity readings , samples were taken for IFN β activity using a standard cytopathic effect CPE assay.Figure 1 shows the results of these tests. As shown, addition of 3 ethanol increases IFN β activity aboutone and one half log units. IL 2 Frozen tubes of IL 2 and IL 2 The seed cultures were shaken at 37 C until an OD Just prior to inoculation the pH was brought to 6.8 and maintained there throughout the run, using 5 NKOH. A 50 glucose solution was fed in conjunction with alkali demand to maintain the resicual glucose atapproximately 5 10 g liter. The oxygen demand of the culture as met as follows from the initial conditionsof 350 rpm and no air sparging, the rpm was first ranged up to 1200, followed by increasing the airflow to 5liter min, followed by soarging oxygen, to keep the dissolved oxygen at about 40 of air saturation The amount of tryptophan added was sufficient to repress IL 2 production until 8 10 OD As compared to control fermentations carried out without adding ethanol to the cultivation medium,addition of ethanol resulted in about a 2 fold increase in production of IL 2 or IL 2 Frozen tubes of IL 2 The operating pH of the fermenters was maintained with 5 N KOH at 6.8. A 50 glucose feed wastriggered by base addition requirements. Residual glucose in the fermenters was maintained between 5 10g liter. Dissolved oxygen in the fermenters was maintained at 40 through agitation to a maximum of 1200rpm, then through air sparging to a maximum of 2 liters per min. Oxygen sparging was then used to 4 litersper min. CAA a 20 stock solution of autoclaved amino acids were added to the fermenter when the turbidityequaled about 10 OD. Growth rate between 1 and 10 OD is typically about u 0.60 0.70 hr One percent CAA was added to tank A . To the rest of the tanks 2 CAA was added. No ethanol wasadded to either tank A or B . Two percent ethanol was added to tank C , and ethanol was added totank D . Optical density, activity, and IL 2 protein measurements were made at various stages of the fermentations.Culture protein was estimated from optical density, and IL 2 protein from gel scans of crude extracts.Specific activity for IL 2 was calculated by combining the activity data with the gel scans. For comparison, aharvest sample taken from a fermentation tacking CAA addition was run concurrently on the gel. These measurements are reported in Table 1 below. As shown by the data in the table, the addition of CAA increased the yield of total protein from 3.6 to7.6 2 CAA and 6.1 1 CAA . Qualitatively, 2 CAA gives significantly more IL 2 than 1 . Also,addition of ethanol tanks C and D improve the production of IL 2 over fermentations without ethanol A andB . Figure 2 shows the growth kinetics of the four fermentations.
