# Improved sensing and welding arrangements for manipulator welding apparatus.

## Abstract
Manipulator apparatus 10 with weld seam track ing capabilities is provided with a sensing hand e.g. 148 or 22 attached to the manipulator arm 18 . The sensing hand 148 or 22 includes a projection unit 50 for projecting an optical slit pattern onto the workpiece 14, 16 . The sensing hand 148 or 22 also includes a path sensing unit 56 including an objective lens 60 and a fiber optic cable 62 for receiving by reflection from the workpiece the projected optical slit pattern. The fiber optic cable is connected to a camera 32 located remotely from the sensing hand. The image received by the camera is utilized by the manipulator apparatus during a sensing step to determine the devia tion between the path traversed by tile manipulator during sensing and the actual workpiece path. The de viation is then utilized to calculate the workpiece path data for welding the desired weld seam. In one arrange ment, the manipulator carries a welding hand 146 and a sensing hand 148 . The sensing hand 148 is movably controlled by the manipulator apparatus be tween an operative sensing position at 154 and an inoperative welding position at 156 .
