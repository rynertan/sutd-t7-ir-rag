# Method and apparatus for electrofiltration.

## Abstract
A system and method for rapidly and efficiently dewatering or separating particles by electrofiltration are described in which the suspension of solids is first demineralized. The suspension of solids may be demineralized by electrodialysis, dialysis, filtration. diafiltration or washing on a rotating drum continuous suction filter.
