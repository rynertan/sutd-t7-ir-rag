# Fiber optic sensing apparatus for sensing the relative position of ink droplets or other objects of similar size in flight.

## Abstract
Optical fibers 2, 3 and 4 are used to sense fluid ink drops along the x, y and z axis of an orthogonal coordinate system. A drop sensing zone is defined in the narrow space between the faces of a single input fiber and two output fibers. An LED 58 infrared light source is coupled to a remote end of the input fiber. Infrared sensitive photodiodes 61 are coupled to the remote ends of each output fiber. The photodiodes are in turn coupled to a differential amplifier 69 whose output represents a displacement error for the x and y axis and represents a time reference for the z axis for the case where the drop flight path is along the z axis. A plurality of sensors are disclosed in an ink recording system having a plurality of nozzles 33 and in an ink recording system having an ink generator traversing the length of a high speed rotating drum 100.
