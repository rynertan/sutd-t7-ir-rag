# Rotary vaned pumps.

## Abstract
A rotary vaned pump has solid vanes 44 of fixed length sliding in a boss 24 mounted for rotation about a longitu dinal axis eccentrically displaced from the longitudinal axis of the pump chamber, so as to provide respective pump compartments in the pump chamber which vary cyclically in volume and are arranged to pressurise fluid entering the pump chamber through an inlet opening 38 and discharg ing from the chamber through an outlet opening 42 . Each leading vane edge that passes over the inlet opening is formed as a shearing knife edge 52 that shear cuts any cuttable solid material in the entering fluid that is engaged by the edge as it enters the pump chamber through the inlet. Such solid material is thereby cut into pieces which can be handled by the pump without jamming rotation of the rotor. The leading edge of the inlet opening 38 is also formed as a knife edge 56 that co operates with the vane edge to shear the solid material. The vanes 44 slide radially in the rotor boss and their tips engage the rotor chamber cylindrical interior surface surrounding the longitudinal axis, this sur face being formed as a specially calculated face cam 48 permitting the use of the solid constant length vanes.
