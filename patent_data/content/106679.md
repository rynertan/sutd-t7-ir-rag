# PRESSURE ACTIVATED LOW PRESSURE WARNING DEVICE

## Abstract
A device for indicating a pressure drop or low pressure condition in a tyre includes a strut 14 for intermittently contacting a wall of a tyre, a striker 16 attached to the strut 14 for producing an acoustic signal when the strut 14 strikes the tyre wall, and a pressure activated latch 18 for preventing the strut 14 from contacting the tyre wall when the pressure in the tyre is above a given value.
