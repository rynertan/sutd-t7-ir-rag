# CONTINUOUS BULK PROCESS FOR PRODUCING IMPACT THERMOPLASTICS WITH CONTROLLED PARTICLE SIZE

## Abstract
Particle size of rubber is controlled and minimized in a continuous bulk polymerization of impact resistant polymers obtained bv the polymerization of vinyl aromatic monomer and an elastomeric polymer by utilizing at least three distinct reaction zones comprising a slightly agitated pregrafting zone in which none or only a small amount of chain transfer agent is added a prepolymerization zone in which shearing agitation taxes place, the bulk of the chain transfer agent is added and phase inversion occurs and a polymerization zone in which polymerization is completed under substan tially static conditions.
