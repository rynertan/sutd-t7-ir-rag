# Glue stick adhesives.

## Abstract
Glue sticks for use in a hand held glue gun comprise thermoplastic copolyester corresponding to a product of an acid component comprising in selected proportions tereph thalic acid, isophthalic acid and aliphatic dicarboxylic acid, an hydroxyl component comprising one or more aliphatic diols of which not less than 90 moles is 1.4 butane diol, and a polymeric plasticiser component. The glue stick has a melting point of 90 to 120 C and a reduced viscosity of 0.5 to 0.7. Preferred glue sticks have a melting point of about 110 C, a reduced viscosity of 0.6 to 0.65 and comprise a copolyester from an acid component comprising 45 to 48 moles tereph thalic acid, 38 to 45 moles isophthalic acid and 10 to 15 moles azelaic acid, an hydroxyl component comprising 1.4 butane diol and 1.6 hexane diol in a molar ratio of 90 to 95 5 to 10, and a polymeric plasticiser component comprising a polycaprolactone or selected hydroxy polyester to an extent of 3 to 4 by weight of the copolyester. The glue sticks can be used as general purpose adhesives and have useful open times.
