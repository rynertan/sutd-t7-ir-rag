# Transfer factor and method for producing same.

## Abstract
Transfer Factor to be used therapeutically by paren teral administration in human beings to obtain immunity directed against an antigen which is pathogenic in man, such as cancer cells or extracts thereof, is produced by immunizing pigs or other large non primate mammal host animals with the antigen and thereafter obtaining Transfer Factor from leukocytes from the animal. The separation of Transfer Factor from the leukocytes is performed by incubating the leukocytes and thereafter rupturing them, preferably lyophilizing the ruptured cell material, and per forming dialysis to exclude molecules having a molecular weight of above 10,000.

## Description
Transfer Factor and Method for Producing Same.The present invention relates to a method for producing TransferFactor to be used therapeutically by injection into human beings to obtain an immunity directed against an antigen which is pathogenic in man.It is well known to use Transfer Factors specific to various antigens which are pathogenic in man in the therapy of the corresponding diseases.The rationale in the use of Transfer Factor as anti tumor therapy is that individuals immunized with tumor antigens will passively through contamination or actively through parenteral administration give rise to production of Transfer Factor directed against tumor antigens Vetto, R.M., Burger, D.R., Nolte, J.E.

Spitler, L.E., Immunologic Parameters before and during Immunotherapy with Tumour Specific Transfer Factor, J. Clin. Invest. 55, 487 499, 1975 later followed up in a long term study Byers, V.S., LeCam, L., Levin, A.S., Johnston, J.O andHackett, A.J., Immunotherapy of Osteogenic Sarcoma with TransferFactor, Long Term Follow Up Cancer Immunol. Immunotherapy 6, 243 253, 1979.Specific Transfer Factor is a dialyzable product contained in dialysates from white blood cells originating from a host organism which is immunized with a homologous specific antigen.The activity of Transfer Factor is not species specific, which is primarily due to is low molecular weight Boucheix, C.L.,Phillips, J., Pizza, G., Sartorio, C. Viza, D., Activity of AnimalTransfer Factor in Man. The Lancet, i 1977 . The method of the invention for producing Transfer Factor to be used therapeutically by injection into human beings to obtain immunity directed against antigen which is pathogenic in man comprises immunizing a non primate host animal with the antigen and thereafter obtaining therapeutically useful Transfer Factor from leukocytes from the animal. The principle of the invention is that antigens which are pathogenic in man are used for immunizing non primate host animals, in particular pigs or other large mammals. This produces a Transfer Factor of the animal leukocytes directed against the antigen in question and useful in human therapy. The Transfer Factor may be separated by dialysing the white blood cells of the host animal.In the present context, the term antigen which is pathogenic in man is intended to designate a protein or a proteinaceous substance which is capable of eliciting an immune response in the host animal to result in a production of Transfer Factor transferring immunity against the said antigen.As examples of antigens which are pathogenic in man may be mentioned cancer cells and extracts thereof, infectious fungi, infectious bacteria, infectious vira, and infectious rickettsia.The invention is of particular importance in connection with the production of Transfer Factor directed against human cancer tumor , but is also generally applicable for the treatment of diseases where the patient suffers from immunodefects such as patients under immunosuppressive treatment or patients during cytostatic treatment, for example, patients suffering from leukaemia.One major advantage of producing Transfer Factor by immunization of pigs or other non primates is that pigs or other non primates can be immunized, without any ethical restrictions, with antigens which are pathogenic in man. There would be ethical objections against actively immunizing human beings with various pathogenic antigens such as cancer cells or extracts thereof. An advantage of using pigs as Transfer Factor producers is that the pig is immunologically closely related to primates.However, because of the low molecular weight of Transfer Factor of about 5000, it must be presumed that also other non primate host animals such as horse, cow and sheep would be useful as host animals for producing TransferFactor with specificity against antigens which are pathogenic in man, including cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, and with tolerability in human beings, considering that the risk that such heterologousTransfer Factor should be capable of causing an immunization of human beings against the Transfer Factor itself on parenteral administration will be small due to the low molecular weight of the Transfer Factor.This also conforms with the fact that it is generally known to use heterologous insulin pigs and cows for human application, even though the molecular weight of insulin is higher than the molecular weight of Transfer Factor and that it is generally known that heterologous ACTH adreno corticotropic hormone having a molecular weight of about the same order of size as Transfer Factor, is well tolerated by human beings.The porcine Transfer Factor or Transfer Factor from other animal species is dialyzable. This offers the advantage that by dialyzing a Transfer Factor containing protein suspension, one obtains, in the dialysis liquid, exclusively Transfer Factor and contaminating molecules having a molecular size determined by the porosity of the dialysis tube. Hence, for the production of Transfer Factor, one chooses a dialysis tube which allows passage of molecules of the size less than 6000 10.000 or any other form of separation of molecules, for example gel filtration, ultrafiltration or ultracentrifugation, allowing separation of molecules having a molecular weight below 6000 lQ.000. Also, Amicon filters or membranes such as TC5E and PM 10 membrane may be used.Furthermore, it is possible to utilize separation aiming at obtaining molecules with a molecular weight below 6000 10.000 by means of a vacuum dialysis apparatus. Even though the separation, in principle, aims at only allowing passage of molecules having a molecular weight below 6000, in other words, in the lower end of the above stated interval, it is often preferred to use methods which allow passage of molecules having a somewhat higher molecular weight, that is, up to 10.000, in other words, the upper end of the above stated interval, as this results in an optimum obtainment of molecules having a molecular weight in the range of about 5000. Furthermore, column chromatography separation methods as described by G. David Novelli in The Mediators of CellularImmunity 1977 may be used. Other methods for separating molecules with different molecular weight or charge such as electrofocussing or ion exchange may, of course, also be used for obtaining TransferFactor from the non human leukocytes. As mentioned above, Transfer Factor is generally useful in the treatment of various human diseases such as immune defects, virus diseases or bacterial diseases and certain cancer diseases. Especially should be noted Allan S. Levin et al. s immune therapy of osteogenic sarcoma using human tumor specific Transfer Factor. As donors for Transfer Factor in that article, human beings were used which were or have been in close contact with the patient treated with this Transfer Factor A.S. Levin, V.S. Byers, H. Hugh Fudenberg,J. Wybran, A.J. Hackett, J.O. Johnson and L.E. Spitler, J.Clin.Invest. 55 487 499, 1975 .One therapeutic advantage in producing cancer specific porcine or other large mammal Transfer Factor upon immunization of the host animal with the human cancer cells in question is that it becomes possible to produce Transfer Factor against various cancer types by active immunization of the host animal with these various cancer cell types. In each single case, this results in a Transfer Factor which is useful for the treatment of patients suffering from the same type of cancer. In preliminary experiments, it has been found that a cancer specific Transfer Factor produced from leukocytes from pigs immunized with human cancer cells of osteogenic sarcoma type, is tolerated by the human patient during a long term treatment injection of porcine Transfer Factor .Furthermore, it has been found that the effect on the cancer disease of the patient upon instituted therapy with porcine Transfer Factor was the following increase in the number of white blood cells, increase in the hemoglobin percentage, increase in the thrombocyte count, decrease in basic phosphatases basic phosphatases are increased at osteogenic sarcoma to the normal range. Furthermore, technetium scanning isotope scanning showed a considerable reduction of the tumor size. It should be noted that cytostatic treatment with methotrexate was given three weeks prior to the institution of the Transfer Factor treatment without any reduction of the tumor size it is known that methotrexate exerts its activity within three weeks from instituted treatment. As mentioned above, porcine Transfer Factor with cancer specificity has been obtained from white blood cells derived from a pig immunized with human cancer cells. However, as mentioned above, it is also possible to use other antigens which are pathogenic in man for immunizing the host animal in order to harvest Transfer Factor inducing the corresponding immunities, for example, antigen pertaining to fungus infections, bacterial infections and virus infections, rickettsia infections and any other infection.The term cancer tumor used above is intended to designate cancer cells generally, cancer cells pertaining to tumors and also tumor cells which are not necessarily of malignant character.Example.Human cancer cells osteogenic sarcoma cells were obtained during operation and by biopsy of cancer patients The cancer cells were immediately transported in Eagle MEM, optionally admixed with foetal calf serum or any other nutrient substrate, to the laboratory, where the cell material was seeded in monolayer cultures and in suspension cultures. After colonisation, the cancer culture was again seeded in three passages, until a homogeneous culture has been obtained.The cell culture was marked with the cancer type.After a sufficient growth of the cell culture, the cells were trypsinized and frozen and thawn twice until the cell membranes were ruptured .The cell culture treated in this manner was admixed with equal parts volume volume of Freund s Complete Adjuvant, and the admixture was used for immunization as described below.Also centrifugation 1800 rum 15 minutes 4C of the cell residues has been employed, whereafter the supernatant together with an equal portion volume volume of Freundts Complete Adjuvant was used for the immunization described below. For the immunization, pigs of an age of about 2 months were used.The immunization was performed by injection in subcutis on the neck in total 5 times with intervals of a fortnight.After the fifth immunization, the pig was bled. The blood was kept liquid with citrate ACD as anticoagulation agent. The leukocytes were separated, and the rest of contaminating red blood cells was removed from the leukocyte suspension by repeated washing with cold 0.83 ammonium chloride solution. Leukocyte count counting of buffy coats was performed. About 200 ml buffy coat were obtained per pig, and to this was added cold, sterile 0.83 ammonium chloride solution corresponding to 10 . The mixture was allowed to stand in a refrigerator for 10 minutes. The hemolyzed buffy coat was centrifuged in cooling centrifuge at 800 rpm 25 minutes.The cells were washed in cold K2EDTA PBS. Thereafter, careful mixing of buffy coats and renewed hemolyzation with cold, sterile ammonium chloride solution were performed. The resulting material was allowed to stand for 10 minutes in refrigerator and was thereafter centrifuged in cooling centrifuge at 800 rpm 25 minutes.The leukocyte mixture was stirred in an ice bath during the leukocyte count. Eagle MEM with human serum or foetal calf serum was added 7 until the final concentration of leukocytes was 6.6 x 107 cells per ml.The leukocyte suspension was incubated at 37.50C for 4 hours under stirring.After the incubation was finished, the leukocyte suspension was frozen to 400C and thawed and frozen twice, until the cells were ruptured.The volume of the frozen cell material was 320 ml. The cell count was 6.6 x 107. 320 ml x 6.6 x107 leukocytes 2.1 x 1010 leukocytes 9 21 x 109 leukocytes 1 Transfer Factor unit TFA unit 1 x 109 leukocytes.The cell material was thawed in a water bath and distributed into sterile vials, frozen and lyophilized. Subsequent to lyophilization, 32 ml glass distilled water were added 10 times concentration in relation to the above mentioned 320 ml .The 32 ml of redissolved cell material were poured into a dialysis tube with exclusion limit at the molecular weight 10.000. The tube was tied up and immersed in cold, sterile glass distilled water 450 ml . Dialysation was performed at 40C for 2 days. The dialysis tube with content was discarded. The dialysis liquid which now contained Transfer Factor, was distributed in vials and deep frozen. Thereafter, lyophilization was performed. The lyophilized amount was measured out in such a way that each vial contained 0.3 TFA unit.For administration, the freeze dried Transfer Factor is redissolved in glass distilled water and injected subcutaneously or intramuscularly in the patient. The injections are repeated a suitable number of times until the desired tumor reduction has been obtained, or until no further effect can be shown. The above mentioned effect on a case of osteogenic sarcoma was obtained by injection of 1 TransferFactor unit per week.
