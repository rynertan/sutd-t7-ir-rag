## Description
The present invention generally relates to drum servo circuits for a magnetic recording and or reproducing apparatus, and more particularly to a drum servo circuit which can perform an accurate drum servo operation in a magnetic recording and or apparatus employing a 4 head double gap system, for example. During recording and normal reproduction on the so called 4 head double gap system magnetic recording and or reproducing apparatus, standard play heads SP 1 and SP 2 are used in a standard play mode, and expanded play heads EP 1 and EP 2 are used in an expanded play mode. For example, in the case where a magnetic tape is originally intended to provide two hours of play in the standard play mode, it is possible to obtain six hours of play with this magnetic tape in the expanded play mode. The heads are mounted on a rotary drum at such positions that the head EP 2 leads the head SP 1 by a predetermined angle ϑ in a rotational direction of the rotary drum and the head EP 1 leads the head SP 2 by the predetermined angle ϑ in the rotational direction of the drum. In such a magnetic recording and or reproducing apparatus, a rotational phase detection pulse signal is obtained by detecting the rotational phase of the rotary drum. However, there is a phase error t1 ϑ dependent on the predetermined angle ϑ between the rotational phase detection pulse signal obtained in the standard play mode and the rotational phase detection pulse signal obtained in the expanded play mode. Hence, in order to control a drum motor which drives the rotary drum based on sampling pulse signals having identical timings in both the standard and expanded play modes, it is necessary to produce a trapezoidal wave signal for each play mode by changing the time constant of a monostable multivibrator depending on the play mode. In a conventional drum servo circuit, the time constant of the monostable multivibrator is changed by use of a switch which switches over and connects the monostable multivibrator to an appropriate one of variable resistors depending on the play mode. As a result, the variable resistors which are provided externally to the monostable multivibrator must be used, and it is difficult to produce the drum servo circuit in the form of an integrated circuit because of the external elements. In addition, there is a problem in that the delay introduced in the monostable multivibrator is large in the expanded play mode and causes instability of the drum servo operation. On the other hand, it is possible to conceive a drum servo circuit in which the time constant of a shaping circuit is changed between the standard and expanded play modes, without the use of the variable resistors connected externally to the monostable multivibrator. According to this conceivable drum servo circuit, it is unnecessary to provide the variable resistors, and furthermore, the delay introduced in the expanded play mode is the same as the delay introduced in the standard play mode and is small. For this reason, it is possible to achieve a stable drum servo operation. However, the delay introduced in the shaping circuit during the expanded play mode is determined by a timing of a rotational speed detection pulse signal which is obtained by detecting the rotational speed of the rotary drum. Therefore, there is a problem in that it is impossible to arbitrarily set the delay time in the shaping circuit. US 4 490 755 discloses a drum servo circuit for a video recorder and reproducer having several pairs of heads and selectable different tape travel speeds. According to the invention, there is provided a drum servo circuit as defined in the appended Claim 1. Preferred embodiments of the invention are defined in the other appended claims. It is thus possible to provide a drum servo circuit for a magnetic recording and or reproducing apparatus, which does not require a large number of external elements. It is also possible to produce the drum servo circuit in the form of an integrated circuit with ease. Furthermore, it is possible to perform a stable drum servo operation both in the standard and expanded play modes. The present invention will be further described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which During recording and normal reproduction on the so called 4 head double gap system magnetic recording and or reproducing apparatus, standard play heads SP 1 and SP 2 are used in a standard play mode, and expanded play heads EP 1 and EP 2 are used in an expanded play mode. For example, in the case where a magnetic tape is originally intended to provide two hours of play in the standard play mode, it is possible to obtain six hours of play with this magnetic tape in the expanded play mode. The heads are mounted on a rotary drum at such positions that the head EP 2 leads the head SP 1 by a predetermined angle ϑ in a rotational direction of the rotary drum counterclockwise in FIG.1B and the head EP 1 leads the head SP 2 by the predetermined angle ϑ in the rotational direction of the drum, as shown in FIGS.1A and 1B. The mutually opposing heads SP 1 and SP 2 have gaps of mutually different azimuth angles, and the mutually opposing heads EP 1 and EP 2 have gaps of mutually difference azimuth angles. FIG.2 shows the block system of an example of the conventional drum servo circuit of the type disclosed in the Victor Service Manual no. 31060 entitled Video Cassettes HR D130 published in July, 1985. In FIG.2 and in FIGS.4 and 7, which will be described later on in the specification, switches SW are connected to respective terminals REC or PB depending on whether the apparatus is set for the recording or normal reproduction playback , or to respective terminals SP or EP depending on whether the mode of the apparatus is set to the standard play mode or the expanded play mode. In FIG.2, a video signal a1 shown in FIG.3 A is applied to a terminal 11 and is supplied to a vertical synchronizing signal separating circuit 12 wherein a vertical synchronizing signal b1 shown in FIG.3 B is separated from the video signal a1. The separated vertical synchronizing signal b1 from the vertical synchronizing signal separating circuit 12 is supplied to an oscillator circuit counter 13 which counts clock pulses and is reset by the vertical synchronizing signal b1. The oscillator circuit 13 produces therein a count signal c1 shown in FIG.3 C . Threshold values K1 and K2 are set in the oscillator circuit 13, and a pulse is produced from terminals K1 and K2 when a counted value of the clock pulses in the oscillator circuit 13 reaches the respective threshold values K1 and K2, where K1 K2. A control pulse generating circuit 14 generates a control pulse signal d1 shown in FIG.3 D from a pulse signal produced from the terminal K1 of the oscillator circuit 13, and this control pulse signal d1 is passed through an amplifier 15 and is recorded on a magnetic tape not shown by a control head 16. On the other hand, a sampling pulse generating circuit 17 generates a sampling pulse signal e1 shown in FIG.3 E from a pulse signal produced from the terminal K2 of the oscillator circuit 13, and the sampling pulse signal e1 is supplied to a phase comparator 18. A rotational phase detection pulse signal f1 shown in FIG.3 F is produced by a known means which detects the rotational phase of a drum motor 21. The rotational phase detection pulse signal f1 is amplified in an amplifier 22 and is supplied to a shaping circuit 24. A rotational speed detection pulse signal g1 shown in FIG.3 G is produced by a known means which detects the rotational speed of the drum motor 21. The rotational speed detection pulse signal g1 is amplified in an amplifier 23 and is supplied to the shaping circuit 24. The shaping circuit 24 produces a signal h1 shown in FIG.3 H from the output signal of the amplifiers 22 and 23, and supplies the signal h1 to a multiplier 25 which multiplies the signal h1 by two and produces a signal i1 shown in FIG.3 I . In the standard play mode, a variable resistor VR The phase comparator 18 compares the phase of the sampling pulse signal e1 and the phase of the trapezoidal wave signal ℓ1 and produces a phase error signal. This phase error signal is passed through a lowpass filter 19 and is supplied to a motor driving amplifier 20. The motor driving amplifier 20 produces a driving signal which is used to drive and control the drum motor 21. On the other hand, in the expanded play mode, a rotational phase detection pulse signal m1 shown in FIG.3 M is obtained and is supplied to the amplifier 22. There is a phase error t1 ϑ between this rotational phase detection pulse signal m1 and the rotational phase detection pulse signal f1 obtained in the standard play mode. This phase error t1 ϑ is dependent on the predetermined angle ϑ between the mounting positions of the heads EP 2 and SP 1 or EP 1 and SP 2 . In addition, a rotational speed detection pulse signal n1 shown in FIG.3 N is supplied to the amplifier 23 in the expanded play mode. Consequently, the shaping circuit 24 produces a signal o1 shown in FIG.3 O , and the multiplier 25 produces a signal p1 shown in FIG.3 P . In the expanded play mode, a variable resistor VR However, according to the conventional circuit shown in FIG.2, the time constant of the monostable multivibrator 26 must be changed by controlling the switch which connects either the variable resistor VR Accordingly, it is possible to conceive a drum servo circuit which does not require the provision of the variable resistors VR It is possible to conceive another drum servo circuit which does not require the provision of the variable resistors VR According to the latter conceivable drum servo circuit, it is unnecessary to provide the variable resistors VR FIG.4 shows the block system of a first embodiment of the drum servo circuit according to the present invention. In FIG.4, those parts which are the same as those corresponding parts in FIG.2 are designated by the same reference numerals, and description thereof will be omitted. In FIG.4, a vertical synchronizing signal b2 shown in FIG.5 B2 is separated from a video signal a2 shown in FIG.5 A2 in the vertical synchronizing signal separating circuit 12. The signals a2 and b2 are identical to the signals a1 and b1 described before, respectively. A count signal c2 shown in FIG.5 C2 is produced within a 60 Hz oscillator circuit counter 31 which counts clock pulses and is reset by the vertical synchronizing signal b2. Threshold values C1, C2, C3 and C4 are set in the oscillator circuit 31, and a pulse is produced from terminals C1, C2, C3 and C4 when a counted value of the clock pulses in the oscillator circuit 31 reaches the respective threshold values C1, C2, C3 and C4, where C1 C2 C3 C4 and the difference between C2 and C3 is t1 ϑ . When the counted value in the oscillator circuit 31 reaches the threshold value C1, a flip flop 32 produces a signal d2 shown in FIG.5 D2 from a pulse signal produced from the terminal C1. A reset pulse generating circuit 33 generates a reset pulse signal e2 shown in FIG.5 E2 from the signal d2. When the counted value in the oscillator circuit 31 reaches the threshold value C4, a flip flop 34 produces a signal f2 shown in FIG.5 F2 from a pulse signal produced from the terminal C4. The control pulse generating circuit 14 generates a control pulse signal g2 shown in FIG.5 G2 from the signal f2. FIG.6 shows the general construction of an example of the oscillator circuit counter having threshold values set therein. The construction of this oscillator circuit is known. For convenience sake, it will be assumed that the oscillator circuit is set with two threshold values C1 and C2 as in the case of the oscillator circuit 13 described before. In FIG.6, a clock signal is applied to an input terminal 50 and is supplied to a counter constituted by n flip flops Q1 through Qn. The separated vertical synchronising signal b1 is applied to one input terminal of a gate circuit 51, and a pulse signal REC H which has a high level during the recording is applied to another input terminal of the gate circuit 51. An output signal of the gate circuit 51 is passed through a delay flip flop 52 and an OR gate 53, and is supplied to load terminals L of the flip flops Q1 through Qn. In addition, n bit preset data are applied to preset data terminals PD of the flip flops Q1 through Qn from terminals PD1 through PDn and are loaded therein. Output signals of the flip flops Q1 through Qn are passed through a buffer 54 constituted by AND gates, and output signals of the buffer 54 are supplied to flip flops 55 and 56 which respectively produce signals in accordance with the timings with which the threshold values C1 and C2 are reached. When all of the outputs of the flip flops Q1 through Qn are high, a signal from the buffer 54 is passed through a flip flop 57 and the OR gate 53 and is applied to the load terminals L of the flip flops Q1 through Qn. The oscillator circuit 31 has a similar construction except that four threshold values are set therein as compared to two in FIG.6. In FIG.4, a switch S1 is connected to a terminal SP in the standard play mode and to a terminal EP in the expanded play mode. In the standard play mode, a pulse signal is supplied to a flip flop 35 from the terminal C3 of the oscillator circuit 31 when the counted value therein reaches the threshold value C3, and the flip flop 35 produces a signal h2 shown in FIG.5 H2 . The trapezoidal wave generating circuit 28 generates a trapezoidal wave signal i2 shown in FIG.5 I2 from the signal h2. A rotational phase detection pulse signal j2 shown in FIG.5 J2 and a rotational speed detection pulse signal k2 shown in FIG.5 K2 are supplied to the shaping circuit 24 via the respective amplifiers 22 and 23. Hence, the shaping circuit 24 produces a signal ℓ2 shown in FIG.5 L2 and the multiplier 25 produces a signal m2 shown in FIG.5 M2 . The signal m2 is supplied to the monostable multivibrator 26 having the time constant T1 and is formed into a signal n2 shown in FIG.5 N2 . This signal n2 is formed into a signal o2 shown in FIG.5 O2 in a polarity selecting circuit 36, and the sampling pulse generating circuit 17 generates a sampling pulse signal p2 shown in FIG.5 P2 from the signal o2. The output signal n2 of the monostable multivibrator 26 resets a 60 Hz oscillator circuit counter 37 which counts clock pulses and produces therein a count signal q2 shown in FIG.5 Q2 . Threshold values C5 and C6 are set in the oscillator circuit 37, where C5 C6 and the difference between the threshold values C5 and C6 is equal to t1 ϑ . A pulse signal produced from a terminal C5 of the oscillator circuit 37 resets a 60 Hz oscillator circuit counter 38 which counts clock pulses and produces therein a count signal r2 shown in FIG.5 R2 . A threshold value C7 is set in the oscillator circuit 38. A pulse signal produced from a terminal C7 of the oscillator circuit 38 is supplied to the flip flop 27, and a drum switching pulse signal s2 shown in FIG.5 S2 is produced from the flip flop 27. On the other hand, in the expanded play mode, a pulse signal is supplied to the flip flop 35 from the terminal C2 of the oscillator circuit 31 when the counted value therein reaches the threshold value C2, and the flip flop 35 produces a signal h3 shown in FIG.5 H3 . The trapezoidal wave generating circuit 28 generates a trapezoidal wave signal i3 shown in FIG.5 I3 from the signal h3. A rotational phase detection pulse signal j3 shown in FIG.5 J3 and a rotational speed detection pulse signal k3 shown in FIG.5 K3 are supplied to the shaping circuit 24 via the respective amplifiers 22 and 23. Hence, the shaping circuit 24 produces a signal ℓ3 shown in FIG.5 L3 and the multiplier 25 produces a signal m3 shown in FIG.5 M3 . The signal m3 is supplied to the monostable multivibrator 26 having the time constant T1 and is formed into a signal n3 shown in FIG.5 N3 . This signal n3 is formed into a signal o3 shown in FIG.5 O3 in the polarity selecting circuit 36, and the sampling pulse generating circuit 17 generates a sampling pulse signal p3 shown in FIG.5 P3 from the signal o3. The output signal n3 of the monostable multivibrator 26 also resets the oscillator circuit 37 which counts the clock pulses and produces therein a count signal q3 shown in FIG.5 Q3 . A pulse signal produced from a terminal C6 of the oscillator circuit 37 resets the oscillator circuit 38 which counts the clock pulses and produces therein a count signal r3 shown in FIG.5 R3 . A pulse signal produced from the terminal C7 of the oscillator circuit 38 is supplied to the flip flop 27, and a drum switching pulse signal s3 shown in FIG.5 S3 is produced from the flip flop 27. According to the present embodiment, the 60 Hz oscillator circuit 31 is provided and the pulse signals produced from the terminals C2 and C3 thereof are selectively used depending on the play mode so as to obtain the trapezoidal wave signals i2 and i3. Hence, it is unnecessary to externally couple a plurality of variable resistors to the monostable multivibrator 26 as is required in the conventional drum servo circuit, and it is therefore unnecessary to change the time constant of the monostable multivibrator 26 between the time constants T1 and T2 depending on the play mode. As a result, the drum servo circuit is suited for production in the form of an integrated circuit. Furthermore, it is possible to perform a stable drum servo operation because the delay time in the monostable multivibrator 26 is small. In addition, the timing difference between the drum switching pulse signals in the standard and expanded play modes may be set arbitrarily by setting the threshold values C2 and C3 of the oscillator circuit 31 to appropriate values. In other words, the angle ϑ between the mounting positions of the heads SP 1 and EP 2 or SP 2 and EP 1 may be set arbitrarily. FIG.7 shows the block system of a second embodiment of the drum servo circuit according to the present invention. In FIG.7, those parts which are the same as those corresponding parts in FIGS.2 and 4 are designated by the same reference numerals, and description thereof will be omitted. A video signal a4 and a vertical synchronizing signal b4 shown in FIGS.8 A and 8 B are identical to the video signal a1 and the vertical synchronizing signal b1 described before, respectively. FIGS.8 C through 8 G respectively show a signal c4 produced within the oscillator circuit 31, an output signal of the flip flop 32, and output reset pulse signal e4 of the reset pulse generating circuit 33, an output signal f4 of the flip flop 34, and an output control pulse signal g4 of the control pulse generating circuit 14. In the standard play mode, a monostable multivibrator 39 produces a signal t4 shown in FIG.8 H from the pulse signal produced from the terminal C3 of the oscillator circuit 31. A flip flop 40 produces a signal u4 shown in FIG.8 I from the signal t4, and the trapezoidal wave generating circuit 28 produces a trapezoidal wave signal v4 shown in FIG.8 J from the signal u4. A variable resistor VR is coupled to the monostable multivibrator 39 for adjusting an error in the mounting position of the means for example, magnetic head which detects the rotational phase of the drum motor 21. A rotational phase detection pulse signal w4 shown in FIG.8 K is supplied to the sampling pulse generating circuit 17 via the amplifier 22, and the sampling pulse generating circuit 17 generates a sampling pulse signal x4 shown in FIG.8 L . On the other hand, in the expanded play mode, the monostable multivibrator 39 produces a signal t5 shown in FIG.8 O from the pulse signal produced from the terminal C2 of the oscillator circuit 31. The flip flop 40 produces a signal u5 shown in FIG.8 P from the signal t5, and the trapezoidal wave generating circuit 28 produces a trapezoidal wave signal v5 shown in FIG.8 Q from the signal u5. A rotational phase detection pulse signal w5 shown in FIG.8 R is supplied to the sampling pulse generating circuit 17 via the amplifier 22, and the sampling pulse generating circuit 17 generates a sampling pulse signal x5 shown in FIG.8 S . An oscillator circuit counter 41 counts clock pulses generated from a crystal oscillator 42 which supplies the clock pulses also to the oscillator circuit 31 to be counted therein. The oscillator circuit 41 has a threshold value C8 set therein and is reset by the pulse signal produced from the terminal C3 of the oscillator circuit 31. Hence, a count signal y4 shown in FIG.8 M is produced within the oscillator circuit 41. A pulse signal produced from a terminal C8 of the oscillator circuit 41 is formed into a drum switching pulse signal z4 shown in FIG.8 N in the flip flop 27. In the first and second embodiments, it is possible to use a 30 Hz oscillator circuit for the oscillator circuit 31, and set therein a total of eight threshold values corresponding to the four threshold values C1 through C4 in the first field and the four threshold values C1 through C4 in the next field in FIG.5 C2 , so that eight pulse signals are produced from respective terminals in accordance with the timings with which the counted value reaches the eight threshold values. FIG.9 shows the block system of an essential part of a third embodiment of the drum servo circuit according to the present invention. In FIG.9, those parts which are the same as those corresponding parts in FIGS.4 and 7 are designated by the same reference numerals, and description thereof will be omitted. In FIG.9, a sampling pulse generating circuit 17a generates sampling pulse signals responsive to the pulse signals produced from the respective terminals of the oscillator circuit counter 31. On the other hand, a trapezoidal wave generating circuit 28a generates a trapezoidal wave signal from a rotational phase detection pulse signal which is obtained by detecting the rotational phase of the drum motor 21. The phase comparator 18 compares the phase of the output sampling pulse signal of the sampling pulse generating circuit 17a and the phase of the output trapezoidal wave signal of the trapezoidal wave generating circuit 28a, and supplies a phase error signal to the lowpass filter 19. The drum servo circuit according to the present invention can also be applied to a magnetic recording and or reproducing apparatus which performs the recording and reproduction by use of a first pair of video heads and performs a slow motion reproduction, still reproduction and search reproduction by use of a second pair of video heads. According to the drum servo circuit of the present invention, a 30 Hz or 60 Hz oscillator circuit counter is provided, and a trapezoidal wave signal or a sampling pulse signal is produced by selectively using threshold values set in the oscillator circuit depending on the play mode. Hence, it is unnecessary to externally couple a plurality of variable resistors to the monostable multivibrator as is required in the conventional drum servo circuit, and it is therefore unnecessary to change the time constant of the monostable multivibrator depending on the play mode. As a result, the drum servo circuit is suited for production in the form of an integrated circuit. In addition, it is possible to perform a stable drum servo operation in both the standard and expanded play modes. Moreover, the timing difference between the drum switching pulse signals in the standard and expanded play modes may be set arbitrarily by setting the threshold values of the oscillator circuit to appropriate values. In other words, the angle ϑ between the mounting positions of the heads SP 1 and EP 2 or SP 2 and EP 1 may be set arbitrarily.
