## Abstract
A micro optic lens is formed by masking a lens element 20 having a length less than the required lens length. Ad hesive 22 is attached to the rear of the lens element and a glass plate 21 attached to the adhesive. An optical fibre 26 is located against the plate 21 , light is transmitted along the fibre, the beam emerging from the element 20 is sensed and the axial position of the plate 21 adjusted until the beam is sensed to be collimated. The adhesive 22 is then cured.
