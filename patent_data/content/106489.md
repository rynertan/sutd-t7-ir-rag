Compound C may next be debenzylated, for example using hydrogen and 20 palladium on carbon catalyst to produce the diamine D. Alternatively, when R H in C, the primary amine function may be protected with a group R4 as defined, hereinabove.For example, the primary amine function may be acylated with an acyl halide such as acetyl chloride by well known procedures. The primary amine function of C may also be converted to a carbamate ester such as the ethyl ester by treatment with ethyl chloroformate in the presence of a strong base such as 1,8 diazabicyclo 5.4.0 undec 7 ene in a convenient solvent such as methylene chloride. The benzyl group may next be removed, for example as described above for Compound C, thereby producing Compound D where R is CO2Et, which after conversion to a compound of the type VIa or VIb may be reacted with a compound having the structural formula IV or V to thereby produce a corresponding compound having the structural formulae I or Ia. The CO2Et group may be removed by standard procedures.

The unit dosage form can also be a capsule, cachet, or tablet itself or it can be the appropriate number of any of these packaged forms. The quantity of active compound in a unit dose of preparation may be varied or adjusted from 1 mg to 100 mg according to the particular application and the potency of the active ingredient. In therapeutic use as agents for treating bacterial infections the compounds utilized in the pharmaceutical method of this invention are administered at the initial dosage of about 3 mg to about 40 mg per kilogram daily. A daily dose range of about 6 mg to about 14 mg per kilogram is preferred. The dosages, however, may be varied depending upon the requirements of the patient, the severity of the condition being treated, and the compound being employed.Determination of the proper dosage for a particular situation is within the skill of the art. Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller dosages which are less than the optimum dose of the compound.Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect under the circumstances is reached. For convenience, the total daily dosage may be divided and administered in portions during the day if desired. The following nonlimiting examples illustrate the inventors preferred methods for preparing the compounds of the invention.
