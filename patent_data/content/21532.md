# Method of manufacturing a ground coating and semi product for the same.

## Abstract
A method of manufacturing a ground coating, for example a road or talus coating, matresses and the like on the basis of a woven mat 1 of preferably synthetic warp and weft wires, bounding means being fastened to the mat for applying to one side of the mat casting and curalbe material such as bitumen or concrete 3 , wherein at least one tissue foreign wire is passed from the other side of the mat at two or more places across the tissue to form loops 2 , the curable material being poured on siad loops.

## Claims
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS 1. A method of manufacturing a ground coating, for example, a road or talus coating, mattresses and the like on the basis of a woven mat of preferably synthetic warp and weft yarns, in which bonding means are fastened to the mat for applying to one side of the mat curable cast material, for example, bitumen or concrete, characterized in that at least one tissue foreign wire is passed from the other side across the mat at two or more places in order to form loops , after which the curable material is poured into the loops of the mat. 2. A method as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the loops are arranged on the tissue by means of a needle machine. 3. A ground coating manufactured by the method claimed in claim 1 and or 2. 4. A semi product consisting of a woven mat having a t least one tissue foreign wire passed in looplike fashion at one or more places across the tissue intended for a ground paving as claimed in claim 3.

## Description
Harm Last, Gerrit Eenkhoorn, Gerrit Timmerman andJan Timmerman, all from Genemuiden, The Netherlands.Method of manufacturing a ground coating andsemi product for the same.for the same. The invention relates to a method of manufacturing a ground coating, for example a road or talus coating, mattresses and the like on the basis of a woven mat of preferably synthetic warp and weft wires, bounding means being fastened to the mat for applying to one side of the mat casting and curable material such as bitumen of concrete. In hydraulic engineering it is known to construct mattresses from a tissue Qf, the kind set forth above, across which pins are passed in a manner such that on the pins emerging from the other side of the mat concrete can be poured to form strengthening concrete blocks.It is also known to weave in the mat tissue elements such as iron rods, the ends of which emerge from the mat, to which ends concrete can adhere. It is finally known to apply bonding means to one side of the mat to which a ballast element or the like can adhere. The invention has for its object to provide a completely novel method in which the bonding means can be simply applied by means of a machine and in which, in addition, an uninterrupted adhesion is obtained along substantially the whole contact surface between the ballast means of the coating to be applied and the mat. The method according to the invention is distinguished in that at least one tissue foreign wire is passed from the other side of the mat at two or more places across the tissue to form loops, the curable material being poured on said loops. The loops are preferably made in the tissue by means of a needle machine known in the textile factory.By means of such a needle machine the loops to be provided can be arranged in accordance with a given programme in any desired pattern so that any desired pattern of ballast blocks can be obtained on a mat, for example, for a mattress. The invention will be described more fully with reference to a drawing the drawing shows in fig.1 a perspective view of a first embodiment of a ground coating, particularly, a mattress, fig.2 a view corresponding with that of fig.l of a further embodiment of a ground coating, fig.3 a sectional view of a detail of the tissue with loops provided therein. Referring to the figures numeral l designates a tissue preferably of synthetic warp and weft yarns. This tissue can be manufactured on a conventional loom and any desired weaving pattern may be used. After the manufacture of the tissue loops of a tissue foreign yarn are passed across the tissue, the loops being designated in the figures by numeral 2,These loops are passed across the tissue only at the places where finally the curable casting material 3 has to be applied. This material is formed in fig.l by relatively spaced concrete blocks moulded by a suitable gauge arranged on the mat 1, the gauge being removed after curing, after which a rigid adhesion is obtained between the cured concrete 3 and the loops 2 and the mat 1 respectively. Fig.2 shows d further embodiment in which loops 2 are passed across the mat 1 throughout the surface thereof, after which a layer of asphalt or bitumen is spread on the mat 1. During the plastic phase of the asphalt 4 adhesion is established between the asphalt 4 and the loops 2 and hence adhesion with the mat 1. Such a structure may be suitable for talus protection or for bicycle paths and the like. Fig.3 shows a cross sectional view of the tissue of the mat 1 1 designates the weft yarns and 1 the warp yarn of the tissue. 5 Designates the tissueforeign wire, which Is passed across the tissue 1 at least two places A and B so that after adhesion of the curable material a solid connection with the mat is obtained by means of the portions of the wire extending along the bottom side of this mat.
