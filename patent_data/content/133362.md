# Plastics container.

## Abstract
A plastics container has a side wall 1b and a rim portion 2 moulded in one piece with the side wall. The rim portion 2 is joined to the side wall 1b by an integral hinge portion 3 on which it can be folded inwardly of the container. Thereby a con tainer having an inwardly projecting rim or retaining tabs can be readily produced as a onepiece moulding. Preferably, the side wall 1b and rim portion 2 are inwardly concave, whereby the rim portion can be held in its inwards position by forces caused by folding.
