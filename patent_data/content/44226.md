# Production of synthetic plastics foam material.

## Abstract
Polyurethane foam is formed by the reaction of a polyisocyanate with a polyol in the presence of water. The water reacts with the isocyanate to give carbon dioxide gas which causes the reaction mixture to foam. The foaming is carried out under controlled conditions of pressure less or greater than atmospheric pressure.

## Description
PRODUCTION OF SYNTHETIC PLASTICS FOAM MATERIALTECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention concerns the production of synthetic plastics foam materials and has particular, though not exclusive, reference to the production of polyurethane foam material in block form. The world consumption of polyurethane foam is at a high level and is widely spread geographically.Accordingly, its manufacture is the subject of constant studies in order to find new methods whereby its range of usage may be widened by obtaining new types of foam and at the same time reducing the cost.BACKGROUND ART The conventional methods of producing polyurethane foam are mainly based on a mixture consisting basically of polyol, toluene diisocyanate TDI , water, silicone, and various catalyst agents. The polyol reacts with a part of the TDI to produce polyurethane, whilst a part of the TDI reacts with water to give CO2 and amines.The amines, in their turn, react with another part of the TDI to produce urea. The CO2 promotes foaming of the polyurethane, thereby determining its density, and the urea gives the hardness to the finished product.Silicone stabilizes the foam and regulates the size of the foam cell, whilst the various catalysts speed up the formation of gas and the gelling of the foamed mix. In the conventional foam making process both the mixing of the individual components and the resultant chemical reactions take place at atmospheric pressure and at a temperature of approximately 2 When it is required to produce very soft foam, it is known to add a fluorocarbon such as monofluorotrichloromethane to the mix to increase the foam volume without varying the amount of urea, thus reducing both the density and the hardness.DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION The primary object of the invention is to produce cheaper foams than has hitherto been possible, and, furthermore, to extend the range of available foams by suitable selection of foam density and hardness. According to the present invention there is proposed a method for the production of synthetic foamed plastics materials using formulations based on a polyol, a polyisocyanate and a blowing agent, characterised by foaming under controlled conditions of pressure. The polyol may comprise any suitable polyhydroxyl compound or combination of substances such as are conventionally used in the polyurethane process. The polyisocyanate may also comprise any suitable substance or combination of substances especially the substance known as toluene diisocyanate TDI . Most preferably the presence of water is relied upon to provide the blowing agent, such water reacting with the isocyanate to give carbon dioxide gas as described above, and this may constitute the only blowing agent. Alternatively or additionally however other blowing agents may be used including volatile organic compounds such as fluorocarbons. Other substances as conventionally used in the polyurethane process, such as silicone and catalysts e.g. amine and or organometallic catalysts may be incorporated as desired and as appropriate. The process may be operated at conventional temperature levels and using conventional apparatus or otherwise as desirable and as suitable. In a particularly preferred embodiment the process is operated in a closed circuit system. With the method of the invention, when foams are made under pressures greater than atmospheric, under certain conditions, the cells can be completely open due to bursting and due to implosion when the foam is produced under a pressure lower than atmospheric, that is to say when the pressure difference between the inside and outside of the cell is such as to break the cellular membrane. In conditions of reduced pressure, relative to atmospheric pressure at which foaming occurs with the conventional process, the volume of C02 produced from a standard formulation of the kind described above increases to increase the degree of foaming and give a product of considerably greater volume. The resultant foam is, however, much softer than foam of the same density produced under normal conditions of pressure. If it is required to produce a foam of normal characteristics as regards density and hardness, the increased volume of C02 resulting from the lower process pressure reduces the consumption of C02 and consequently of water and TDI, such reductions having a favourable effect on production costs. An operating pressure in excess of atmospheric pressure has the effect of reducing the volume of C02 produced, and accordingly more water and TDI will be required to generate a quantity of C02 or other gas appropriate to the production of a foam having a density similar to that produced by a conventional process operated at atmospheric pressure. However, the increased amount of water leads to an increase in the amount of amines, and this increase, in its turn, increases the amount of urea and gives a foam of increased hardness.EXAMPLES OF THE BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION The invention will now be described further, by way of example only, and with reference to the followingExamples 1 to 5 in which Examples 2 and 5 are examples of the process of the invention whereas Examples 1, 3 and 4 are comparative examples of processes not in accordance with the invention.EXAMPLE 1 A flexible polyurethane foam is prepared using the following formulation in a machine having four jets in the mixing head and operating at 4000 r.p.m. Parts by weightPolypropyleneglycol molecular weight 4200 100Toluene diisocyanate 80 20 49.97Water 4.00Dimethylethanol amine 0.35Silicone Oil 1.00Tin Octoate 0.25Dioctylphthalate 2.50 The materials are introduced through the respective jets into the mixing chamber in accordance with the following scheme Material Rate of FlowJet 1 Polypropyleneglycol 60 kg min. Jet 2 Toluene diisocyanate 29.38 kg minJet 3 Mixture of water, dimethylethanol amine, amine and silicone oil 3.210 kg min.Jet 4 Balance of materials 1.650 kg min. After mixing for several seconds the mixture is led to a 100 x 100 x 100 cm mould at atmospheric pressure 710mm Hq gauge . The resultant foam had a density of 24.5 kg m3 EXAMPLE 2 The formulation of Example 1 is delivered to the mixing head under like flow conditions, is led to a mould of similar dimensions after having been mixed for ten seconds and is allowed to foam in a reduced pressure environment 358mum Hg gauge . The resultant 3 foam has a density of 14.1 kg m EXAMPLE 3 The following formulation was used to produce a foam of like density to that set forth in Example 2, the process being operated at atmospheric pressure, 710mm Hg gauge .

The indent ation hardness of this foam was 60 kg to UNE Standard 14. Operation of the process as hereinproposed in a closed circuit system provides the great advantage, as far as the operators are concerned, that the gases released during the process can readily be contained, and thus the operators are not under any risk. Additionally, monofluorotrichloromethane gases, on release, may easily be collected and compressed for subsequent recovery. Furthermore, in the context of a closedcircuit system an increased amount of monofluorotrichloromethane may be used, thereby reducing the TDI requirement, without increasinq the manufacturing cost of the foam, since the monofluorotrichloromethane is recoverable. INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY The process as hereinproposed allows of the production at a lower price of softer foams of like density, or of foams of characteristics similar to those of foams produced by conventional methods, simply by reducing the pressure at which the foaming takes place. Alternatively, foams of similar density but higher hardness than foams produced at atmospheric pressure may be produced simply by increasing the pressure at which the foaming takes place. The invention is of particular application to the production of foam in block or moulded form, especially large blocks having dimensions of the order of two metres by one metre by one metre. It has been found that the density change brought about by the affect of reduced or increased pressure 3 is of the order of about 3 kg m3 for each lOOmm by which the maintained pressure falls below or exceeds the prevailing atmospheric pressure. The actual pressure selected will depend on the nature of the foam required. For a low density foam the pressure will be 3 reduced by at least say 50mm corresponding to 1i kg m3 density reduction, and preferably more up to say 650mm so that the foam expands well without need for incorporation of high proportions of organic blowing agent. For a high density foam, the pressure will be increased again by at least 50mm corresponding to 1i kg m density increase, and preferably more up to say 4 kg cm2 and expansion of the foam is restrained. With the conventional foaming procedure, water content in the reaction mixture gives rise to the production of hardening urea groups but the hardening effect is offset by the expansion of the foam by the carbon dioxide produced by reaction of the water with the isocyanate which disperses the urea groups and diminishes the effect thereof. With the increased pressure process of the present invention, sufficient water can be incorporated to give a desired level of urea group production without this giving rise to undue foam expansion.Accordingly such process permits of the formation of foams which are relatively hard yet which are flexible and may have conventional densities, it being understood that increased hardness in a flexible foam may be desirable, particularly for example for furniture applications, in so far as such foams give good support. In general it will be appreciated that the present invention gives greater freedom for the production of foams of desired density and hardness by appropriate selection of the pressure and chemical formulation. The process of the invention may be performed using a conventional mixing head which acts to mix the ingredients of the reaction mixture and then feeds same to a cylindrical chamber in communication with the bottom of a reaction vessel in the form of a large rectangular open topped box, such chamber having therein a piston movable within the chamber to sweep the contents thereof out of the chamber into the bottom of the box.With the conventional process the reaction mixture would be allowed to foam and expand within the box whilst this is open to the atmosphere. In accordance with the present invention, however, such box is enclosed as for example by application of a lid to the top of same or by insertion of the box bodily into an outer closable chamber and the pressure conditions within the box are controlled whilst the reaction mixture reacts and expands. Where high pressure conditions are required it may be sufficient simply to rely on the increase in pressure on sealing of the box caused by rising of the foam and also the evolution of gaseous products such as carbon dioxide, isocyanate fumes, organic vapours.Indeed where a substantially constant high pressure is to be maintained it may be necessary to provide a relief valve in communication with the box which allows release of air and gaseous products when the pressure exceeds the predetermined constant value. Alternatively or additionally and as appropriate the box may be connected to a compression pump and this may be operated in conjunction with a pressure gauge, relief valve, switching controls as appropriate to maintain a desired pressure. Where a low pressure is required the box may be connected to a vacuum pump and appropriate controls and auxiliary equipment may be provided to enable a substantially constant reduced pressure to be maintained. Appropriate recovery apparatus may be interposed between the vacuum pump and the box where organic blowing agent or other substances are to be recovered. The reaction mixture is maintained in the enclosed box until such mixture has gelled and the foam has reached approximately a maximum height this being determined on a pre assessed time basis or alternatively by monitoring the reaction via a sight glass and or with appropriate sensor equipment. The pressure is then returned to atmospheric and the box is opened or removed from the enclosing chamber to enable the resulting block of foam to be removed from the box. It is also possible to operate the process of the invention on a continuous basis, for example, by discharging the reaction mixture to a conveyor belt running within a chamber which is enclosed and maintains required pressure conditions around the belt as the mixture reacts and foams thereon. Where the process is operated at reduced pressure in the presence of fluorocarbon 11 the pressure reduction permits a fluorocarbon saving in parts per 100 parts polyol as follows Pressure reduction mm Hg Saving 50 2.5 100 6 200 13 300 23 400 35
