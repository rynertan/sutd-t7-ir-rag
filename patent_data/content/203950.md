## Description
This invention relates to a single handle mixing valve as defined in the preamble of Claim 1 and known from FR A 2530311. In view of avoiding operation errors by the users, it is commonly required that in all single handle mixing valves a shifting of the lever handle to the right provides for delivery of colder water whilst a shifting to the left provides for delivery of hotter water. This involves that in a certain valve the inlets cannot be exchanged between them, i.e. that the hot water pipe cannot be connected to the inlet intended for cold water and vice versa, since this would result in an undesired reversal in the operation of the valve. Therefore, in installing a plant, the supply pipes inserted in the walls, to which the valves will be connected, should be suitably disposed. However, certain difficulties arise in specific situations. For example, it is very convenient to have two valves in two different rooms placed on the opposite sides of a common wall and connected to common supply pipes. Unfortunately the pipe that is on the right for a first valve turns out to be on the left for the other valve. So, unless one accepts the fact that each valve operates in an opposite fashion from the other, it is necessary to have two valves with two different operating mechanisms therein that provide for reverse arrangement of the supply pipes. This factor causes higher cost and the risk of installing the wrong valve, which would require later replacement. According to EP A 0 119 960 there is provided an additional member which is intended to be connected to the supply pipes and to receive the mixer valve mounted therein in any angular position. A system of water passages is provided in the additional member and the mixer valve in order that the water supplied to each inlet connection of the additional member is always led to a corresponding passage of the mixer valve, irrespective of the position of this latter relative to the additional member. Therefore, by connecting the additional member in one position or in the opposite one with respect to the supply pipes, it is possible to reverse the connection of the mixer valve to the pipes. However, this selection should be made at the moment of connecting the additional member and can in no way be corrected later on if the wrong position has been selected, except for dismounting from the pipes the additional member and re mounting the same in the opposite position. A wrong selection of the connection position is extremely likely, due to the fact that the pipes for hot and for cold water are identical to one another and can in no way be distinguished at the time of installing the additional member. Moreover, the need for a complicated additional member for each mixer valve highly increases the cost of the installation. According to US A 4,022,242, the reverse mounting of a disc valve plate within the valving mechanism allows reversing the relationship between inlet connections and hot, respectively cold, water. However, such an arrangement only allows control of the mixing ratio between hot and cold water, and not a control of the water flow when mixed water is delivered, whereby it could be applied for showers, as stated in the document, but not for any other hydraulical appliance. According to US A 3,674,048, in a valve for showers, only allowing control of the mixing ratio and not of the flow rate, reversing the relationship between inlet connections and hot, respectively cold, water is obtained by differently limiting, in a mechanical way, the stroke allowed to the control member of the valve, which moves in rotation only. Such mechanical means could not be used in valves allowing control both of the mixing ratio and of the flow rate, because their control member should be movable in two different manners, namely in rotation and by a diametrical tilting, and its orientation cannot be freely modified. According to US A 4,243,063, always in a valve for showers only allowing control of the mixing ratio and not of the flow rate, reversing the relationship between inlet connections and hot, respectively cold, water is obtained by differently mounting one of the control members of the valve themselves. Such means could not serve for the more complex valves also allowing control of the flow rate, and moreover it could not be used in cartridge valves, where the control members, contained in the cartridge, are in no way accessible for changing their position. Therefore, in view of the above state of art, there was the problem of allowing reversing the relationship between inlet connections and hot, respectively cold, water, in a valve of more general use than for showers only, suitable for controlling both the mixing ratio and the flow rate, and more particularly in such a valve being a cartridge type, as presently required in most instances. The object of this invention is to overcome the stated difficulties by providing a single handle valve of the type stated in the preamble, wherein, preferably by a simple operation effected when installing the valve and which can be corrected at any time in case of mistake, the disposition of the inlets can be established in the one or in the opposite mode, whereby the valve can receive, at choice, cold water from right inlet and hot water from left inlet, or vice versa, though in any event preserving a correct operation. In accordance with the invention, this object is attained by the features of Claim 1. According to a possible embodiment, the reversing member may include two separate pieces, the first piece being intended to be installed to achieve the first insertion mode and the second piece being intended to be installed to achieve the second insertion mode, the remaining piece of the reversing member being in each case excluded. Thanks to these characteristics, at the time of installation the valve can be simply connected to the supply pipes regardless of whether the cold or the hot water supply pipe is on the right side, and then the actual position of the hot and cold water supply pipes can be compensated by the correct selection of the insertion mode of the reversing member within the valve body, so that the hot and cold water are in any event directed to the appropriate cartridge entrances or other valve portions, irrespective of the hot and cold water passing through the first or the second inlets within the valve body. Any error possibly made during the installation and successively revealed can, in any event, be easily corrected by displacing the reversing member from the one to the other insertion mode. The systematical use of such a possibility often allows to simplify and rationalize the disposition of the supply pipings, as well as to avoid the manufacture of valves having different dispositions of their inlets. These and other features and advantages of the invention will be more clearly apparent from the following description of some preferred embodiments, diagrammatically shown in the appended drawings, in which Referring now to Figure 1, a single handle mixing valve includes a body 1 having two inlets 2 and 3 for hot and cold water and a discharge outlet 4 for the mixed water, as well as a member 5 in the form of a cylindrical extension which has a central bore in the embodiment shown, the inlet 2 extends in axial direction. To the body 1 is connected a cap member 6 which together with the body 1 defines a chamber 7, and against which rests a valving cartridge 8 having first and second entrances 9 and 10 for the hot and cold water, respectively. A control lever 11 extends upwardly through the cap member 6 for controlling in a conventional fashion the movements of the valve elements within the cartridge. The cartridge 8 is fitted within the cap chamber 7 such that the entrances 9 and 10 face downwardly into the bore of extension 5 the cartridge has not been shown in more detail in this figure since it can be of conventional construction, i.e. any usual, well known cartridge for single handle mixer valves. A reversing member 12 is fitted within the bore of extension 5, wherein it seals by means of a peripheral packing, and it has a centrally protruding downward extension 13 that is sized to fit within the central inlet 2 of body 1, wherein it seals by means of a packing 18 pushed by a spring 17. The reversing member 12 has a first passage 14 which extends from the central extension 13 obliquely towards a position on the opposite face of reversing member 12, which registers with the first entrance 9 of cartridge 8. The reversing member further has a second passage 15 which connects a position on the face of the reversing member, registering with the second entrance 10 of cartridge 8, to a peripheral chamber 16, which in turn is in fluid communication with the second inlet 3 of body 1. The peripheral chamber 16 can alternatively be an annular or semi annular chamber or even a peripheral groove that extends only partially about the reversing member. The reversing member 12 can be inserted into the cylindrical extension 5 of body 1 in two different positions the first is that now described and shown in Figure 1, the second position is rotated by 180 around the valve axis with respect to the first position, and it would therefore appear as symmetrical to the position shown with respect to the valve axis. Suitable stops, not shown in this figure, can be provided for fixing these positions and ensure that the reversing member is correctly inserted in one of said two positions. In the position shown, the first passage 14 registers with the first entrance 9 of cartridge 8, and the second passage 15 registers with the second entrance 10 of cartridge 8, whereby water entering the first inlet 2 of body 1 is directed to the first cartridge entrance 9, whilst water entering the second inlet 3 of body 1 is directed to the second cartridge entrance 10. If, on the contrary, the reversing member 12 is displaced to its second position, symmetrical to the first one, passage 14 is made to register with the second cartridge entrance 10 and passage 15 is made to register with the first cartridge entrance 9, whereby water entering the first inlet 2 of body 1 is now directed to the second cartridge entrance 10 and water entering the second body inlet 3 is directed to the first cartridge entrance 9. Therefore the reversing member 12 allows to invert the predisposition of valve inlets with respect to supply pipings. It is to be noted that the three connections inlets 2, 3 and outlet 4, of body 1 do not need to be disposed on a same plane, on the contrary inlet 3 and outlet 4 can each be situated in any angular position around the central inlet 2. In the embodiment described, the reversing member 12 undergoes the thrust of spring 17 and the pressure of water within inlet 3, and therefore it applies to the cartridge a total force resulting from the addition of a constant force and a force proportional to the actual water pressure, thus also effecting the operation of a piston compressing the cartridge, such operation being per se the subject matter of another Patent Application of same Applicant WO 86 03568 . Figure 2 shows a second embodiment in which the components corresponding to those already described are designed by the same references. Substantially, the difference with respect to the first embodiment is that the peripheral chamber intended to communicate the second passage 15 of reversing member 12 with the second inlet 3 of body 1 is a chamber 19 annular or partially annular that is situated within the extension 5 of body 1, rather than a chamber 16 formed within the reversing member 12, and that the packings interposed between the reversing member 12 and the extension 5 are concentrical and, by their own yieldability, also effect the operation of spring 17 of the first embodiment. Such arrangements allow to reduce the general encumbrance of the device, and to simplify the shape of reversing member 12. Also in this case, the reversing member 12 passes from the first to the second insertion mode through a rotation by 180 around the valve axis, and the operation is the same as already described. In this case too, the angular position of connections 3 and 4 around central connection 2 may be whatever. The embodiment according to Figure 3 is suitable for a different disposition of the supply pipings, and inlets 2 and 3 of body 1 are directed in radial direction, for example but not necessarily diametrically opposite the one another, rather than in axial direction as shown in the first two embodiments. The body 1 further includes one or two outlets, not shown, which may be disposed for example at 90 with respect to the inlets 2 and 3. In this case there is no cylindrical extension 5 of body 1, as in the first and second embodiments, and the seat for the reversing member is located within body 1 between inlets 2 and 3. The passages 14 and 15 of the reversing member are both in communication with peripheral chambers, 16A and 16, superimposed the one another and separated by a ring seal, which chambers on their turn are connected to inlets 2 and 3 of body 1. The reversing member 12 passes from its first to the second position through a rotation by 180 around the valve axis, and the operation is the same as already described. The water pressure of inlet 2 acts on reversing member 12 within the chamber 20, whereas a projection of the reversing member 12 is inserted with seal into a blind chamber 21 of body 1 and compresses the air trapped therein, which acts as an elastic member. Therefore, in this embodiment too the reversing member also effects the operation of a piston compressing the cartridge. As it appears from the foregoing examples, the two insertion modes of the reversing member may be achieved by inserting the one or the other of two pieces forming the reversing member, or by rotating the reversing member around the valve axis, or else by displacing the reversing member upside down. Another embodiment, similar to that of Figure 3, is disclosed in Figure 4, in which the passage 15 of the reversing member still communicates with a peripheral chamber 16 connected on its turn to body inlet 3, whilst passage 14 passes through the reversing member and opens centrally on its bottom face, where it directly communicates with inlet 2. The reversing member 12 still passes from its first to the second insertion mode through a rotation of 180 around the valve axis, and the operation is as already described. Number 29 designates a passage in body 1 which connects the one another two outlets not shown disposed at 90 with respect to inlets 2 and 3. The bottom portion of reversing member 12 has a reduced diameter, and undergoes the pressure in inlet 2. Chamber 28, formed where the reversing member 12 is stepped, is blind, and the reversing member compresses the air trapped therein, which operates as an elastic member. Therefore, also in this embodiment the reversing member acts as a piston compressing the cartridge. In the embodiments according to Figures 3 and 4 the inlet 2 and 3 of body 1 may have any angular orientation, and they may also be situated sideways the one another, converging or even parallel. The reversing member according to the invention allows, during the design operation, to choose very freely the position of the inlet and outlet connections of the valve body, particularly when peripheral annular or partially annular chambers are provided for, such as 16, 16A, 19, to which water can arrive from any direction whatever. In view of this fact, the sectional views shown are not necessarily to be interpreted as diametrical sections, and they can represent sections taken along dihedral planes through other possible embodiments.
