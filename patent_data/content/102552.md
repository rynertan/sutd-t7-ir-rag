## Description
The present invention relates to a rectangular 2 phase phase modulation method and its demodulation method. In further detail, it concerns a method of modulating and transmitting or storing in an arbitrary system such as magnetic record two color signals or two separate luminance signals which will not extend the overall width of its occupied band, which is free of data missing and AM noise effects, and a demodulation method therefor. Accordingly, the present invention is mose useful not only for transmission of color picture image signals but also for obtaining high quality pictures in an arbitrary storage of picture image data such as video recording either for movie or still picture recording. In video tape recording using magnetic tapes and discs of the prior art, luminance signals were frequency modulated FM , and two color signals were either amplitude modulated or alternately line sequentially FM modulated by 1 horizontal scanning period 1H , and these FM luminance signals and two AM color signals or line sequential FM color signals were multiplexing recorded on a magnetic medium. In recent years, a method of recording luminance signals by phase modulating the same PM modulation recording system was disclosed in JP Patent Publication 56 51406 and JP Patent Application Lay open Print No. 53 41126. The PM modulation system mentioned above is intended for high density recording of movie pictures moving picture images , and is advantageous in that demodulation is carried out without cross talks despite the high density recording without guard band or by partial overwriting at the time of recording, or tracking errors at the time of reproducing. This method is outlined below in sections 1 to 5 . As described above, various methods are employed in prior art for high density recording, but they were insufficient in the picture quality particularly in video recording of still picture images. For high quality video recording, wide band zones should be respectively allotted to luminance signal Y and two color signals C for modulation. However, there are two kinds of color signals, for example two color difference signals R Y and B Y, which must be detected independently in regeneration, thereby creating various difficulties. We shall now explain representative examples i , ii and iii of the color signal modulation method. Prior art document EP A 0 024 744 discloses a recording and or reproducing apparatus with a photo electronic image device in which color difference signals RY and BY are fed to a quadrature phase modulator to be modulated therein with a carrier signal delivered from a synchronizing signal generator circuit, whereby a color recording signal is obtained. However, in this apparatus two carriers are amplitude modulated by this quadrature phase modulator, i.e. two carriers are perpendicular to each other in phase. Further, prior art document US A 4 217 603 discloses an apparatus for processing color television signals for recording and playback on a magnetic tape and for subsequent display on a PAL color television receiver. Both PAL and NTSC color television signals are converted to a transfer channel format for recording on the magnetic tape, and for converting the signal recovered from the tape to a special output format suitable for reception by the PAL color television receiver. The special output format includes a chrominance subcarrier that has a fixed phase angle and that is amplitude modulated by a special combination of color difference signals. This special chrominance subcarrier can be produced without the need for a delay line and can be properly demodulated by the PAL color television receiver as though it were in a conventional quadrature subcarrier format. It is an object of the present invention to provide rectangular 2 phase phase modulation and demodulation methods which obviate the problems and difficulties of prior art mentioned above, do not require extending of the overall occupied band, do not miss color data, and yet are capable of eliminating AM noises and suitable for high quality recording. To solve this object the present invention provides a method as stated in claim 1 or 12. The method in which two color signals are recorded by rectangular 2 phase phase modulation hereinafter referred to as rectangular 2 phase PM modulation method , can be outlined as summarized below in sections a d . The above going explanation is based on the premise that color picture image signals are recorded on magnetic tapes and discs, but the same is true of transmission systems where signals are transmitted by wire without magnetic recording and then demodulated, or of any other types of picture data storage systems. Since a wider frequency band can be taken for the transmission systems, etc. for example two color difference signals of R Y This invention can be more fully understood from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which The present invention is explained in further detail by referring to a concrete circuit example. There is shown a recording system in Fig. 4 which uses a magnetic disc as a magnetic medium and records luminance signals by FM modulation, and a reproducing system corresponding thereto is shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 4 shows a rectangular 2 phase PM circuit 1, an FM circuit 2 for luminance signals, a counter 3 for forming reference signals, a composite circuit 4, a recording amplifier 5, a magnetic head 6, a magnetic disc 7, and a driving motor 8. The rectangular 2 phase PM circuit 1 comprises a carrier oscillator 9, a phase shifter 10, two balanced modulators 11, 12, composite circuits 13, 14, 15 and an inversion circuit 16. From the output assuming f We shall now explain the principle of PM modulation by using a balanced modulator. Supposing the carrier is Acosω From 4 and 5 , the range which holds is considered to be the range satisfying K f t 1. In studying the first kind Bessel function, it is found from Fig. 6 that if From the above consideration, it is clear that if the modulation index is beneath a certain value, then it may be PM modulated by a balanced modulator. It also becomes clear that multiplexing of PM signals by rectangular 2 phase modulation is also possible. In further considering the maximum modulation index, mp upper limit is more or less determined visually. According to Japanese Patent Publication No. 56 51406 and Lay open print 53 41126, the luminance signal is PM modulated at mp 1.0 or mp 1.3 for practical purposes for allowing cross talks from the adjacent tracks. However, when one considers that the color signals have a narrower band width than the luminance signals, mp When Asinα When demodulating E However, if simply multiplexed as in In order to eliminate the DC component mentioned above, C For demodulation, C t is delayed by 1 H because of the strong vertical correlation existing between adjacent horizontal scanning lines of the picture image signal , so that C t may be separated to C In magnetic recording of still picture images, there is generally no correlation among still pictures recorded in adjacent tracks with different image pickup units whether for frame recording or field recording. Thus, there should be no cross talks with other picture images on the adjacent track. Generally speaking, there is formed a guard band g Take a magnetic disc of about 40 mm plastic film base, the track deviation at its worst becomes 20 µm considering the thermal expansion, wet expansion and decentering. If the recording track width ℓ Fig. 5 shows an embodiment of the reproduction system corresponding to the recording system of Fig. 4 wherein the reference numeral 17 denotes a magnetic head for reproduction, 18 a reproduction amplifier, 19 to 21 a high pass filter for separating FM luminance signals, an amplitude limiter, an FM demodulator respectively, and 22 a demodulator circuit for multiplexed PM color signals. The demodulator circuit 22 of this embodiment comprises a band pass filter BPF for PM color signal extraction 23, a delay line for 1 horizontal scanning time 1HDL 24, a subtractor 25, an adder 26, amplitude limiters 27 and 28, balanced modulators 29, 30, low pass filters 31, 32 and a phase reference signal generator 33. The phase reference signal generator 33 of this particular embodiment comprises a 48f In Fig. 5, FM luminance signal C We shall now discuss the phase reference signals. The phase reference signals necessary for synchronous detection must absorb time base deviations caused by the relative movement of the magnetic disc and the magnetic head at either the time of recording or of reproducing. In the embodiment shown in Figs. 4 and 5, the 6f When one of PM color signals C As shown in Fig. 8, one more PM demodulator 39 is added to the circuit shown in Fig. 5, and the signal C Fig. 10 shows a PM demodulator 39, a gate circuit 40 and a concrete circuit for the comparator 42 which has hysteresis characteristics. Fig. 11 shows a reproducing system corresponding to the recording system of Fig. 4 when phase reference signals are formed by an alternate method. Provided, however, the recording system does not require the counter 3 of Fig. 4. In Fig. 11, the parts identical to those shown in Fig. 5 are given the identical reference numbers in order to avoid redundancy in explanation. In Fig. 11, a gate pulse circuit 43 inputs horizontal synchronous signals 44 to output pulses 43a of the width of horizontal blanking period, and the reference signal gate circuit 45 remains open while it receives the pulse 43a, and sends the burst reference signal 48f In the above going explanation, the luminance signals are FM modulated for recording. Therefore, if reproduction is conducted with the magnetic head overriding the adjacent track, interference between FM luminance signals of adjacent tracks will interfere beats. If the subcarrier phases of PM color signals of adjacent tracks were not aligned, the colors for the reproduced picture image will also become deviated. As shown by hatched lines in Figs. 12 a and 12 b , a so called inclined azimath FM recording system is recommended so that a recording track t The above explanations were given in respect of various examples for recording the luminance signals by FM modulation. We shall now explain the instance where the luminance signals are PM modulated and recorded. Basically, it suffices if a PM modulator is used instead of an FM modulator in the recording system, and a PM demodulator in place of an FM demodulator in the reproducing system. PM modulator and PM demodulator can be realized quite simply by using a balanced modulator as in the modulation demodulation of color signals. When PM modulating and recording both color signals and luminance signals, we might consider the still picture recording apart from the movie recording. In the former, recording reproduction is carried out, in principle, to restrain generation of cross talks by providing a guard band as shown in Figs. 7 a , 7 b and 7 c . Therefore, it is not necessarily required to align the recording positions of horizontal synchronous signals between adjacent tracks, or to align the phases of subcarriers for multiplexed PM color signals and of main carriers of the PM luminance signals. Naturally, it is not a requisite either to adopt inclined azimath system. On the other hand, high density recording becomes possible for the first time after the recording position for the horizontal synchronous color signals, the phases of respective subcarriers of multiplexed PM color signals, and the phase of main carrier for the PM luminance signals between respective adjacent tracks are aligned. In this case, a plural number of picture images with extremely strong correlation alone become overlapped when the regeneration head overrides the adjacent tracks. This will not cause any beat interferences. Therefore, there is absolutely no need to adopt the inclined azimath method, but it is more preferable to use a wider reproduction head which would override a plural number of tracks because of its bigger reproduction output and lower precision requirements for tracking. In the case of still picture taping, if the recording position of horizontal synchronous signals and the phases of respective carriers were aligned between adjacent tracks for recording, a tracking error, if any, would only cause overelapping of a plural number of picture images which have not corrlation to each other without disturbance of the reproduced image. Fig. 14 shows an example of a recording system for PM modulating and recording the luminance signals by using of balanced modulators. Fig. 15 shows an example of a reproducing system therefor. Except for the PM modulator recorder for the luminance signals, the parts shown in these two figures are substantially the same and the like parts are given the like numbers in order to eliminate redundancy in explanation. The recording system shown in Fig. 14 is now explained. In the example, the center carrier for PM, luminance signals is set at ca. 7.8 MHz, and the center carrier for PM color signals at a value 1 6th thereof about 1.3 MHz and the reference signals at 1 3 about 2.6 MHz . 2.6 MHz indicates an empty frequency between the PM luminance signal band and the PM color signal band. In Fig. 14, the reference number 54 denotes a carrier generating circuit, which comprises a 2.6 MHz oscillator 55, a 2.6 MHz band pass filter 56, an amplitude limiter 57, a change over switch 58, a 1 2 frequency divider 59, a 3 multiplexing circuit 60, and phase shifters 61 and 62. The reference number 63 denotes a balanced modulator for PM modulating the luminance signals Y , and 64 a composite circuit. When recording on a new magnetic disc for the first time, the switch 58 at a contact point a is turned ON, a fixed frequency output of the oscillator 55 is used for PM modulation, and PM luminance signal C Fig. 15 shows a regeneration system which is different from Fig. 4 or Fig. 8 in that PM luminance signals are demodulated at a balanced modulator 65, and that 2.6 MHz reference signals f Fig. 16 shows an example of a magnetic disc video recording device to which a system of magnetic recording reproducing still picture images by FM modulating luminance signals is applied in order to facilitate animation reproduction. Naturally, the explanation stands true for the case where still picture images are magnetic recorded reproduced by PM modulating the luminance signals. The circuit shown in Figs. 4, 5 and 8 is used also for the device shown in Fig. 16 and the identical parts are therefore given the identical numbers in order to eliminate redundant explanations. The example shown in Fig. 16 a uses an auxiliary track formed on the magnetic disc 7, for instance, on the outermost periphery thereof for reproducing animations. The reference number 71 denotes a composite main head for still picture recording and is integrally formed with a wide head 6 and a narrow head 17 aligned in the direction of the track. The reference number 72 denotes a composite auxiliary head for reproducing animations which also includes a wide head 73 and a narrow head 74 aligned integral in the direction of the track. Reference number 75 indicates an oscillator for erase signals, 76 a control member, 77 a control device for head positions, 78 a rotation counter for magnetic disc, 79 and 80 amplifiers for recording and regenerating, 81 an amplifier for extracting pilot signals for tracking, and S₁ S₄ switches for mode changes. The main head 71 for still picture recording is positioned on the desired track by moving the same in the radial direction of the magnetic disc, while the auxiliary head 72 for reproducing animations are fixedly positioned on the auxiliary track. The device shown in Fig. 16 a has the three kinds of modes SR for still picture recording, SP for still picture reproducing and AP for animation reproducing. Mode commands are input to the control member 76. We shall now explain the operations of respective modes by referring to Table 1 assuming that the still picture images are recorded in the magnetic disc by 1 track 1 field. Table 1 shows the contact selections of the switches corresponding to the modes. The contact point c for each of the switches indicates OFF. Switch S2 at contact point b alone is turned ON, and other switches S1, S3 and S4 are turned OFF. From the regenerated output of the wide head 6 of the main head 71 is extracted pilot signals for tracking to be fed in the control member 76, and the signal to position the main head 71 on the desired track is given to the head position control device 77, thereby to position the main head 71. S1 at contact point b and S2 at contact point a become turned ON, and others are turned OFF. The output from the oscillator 75 is amplified by the amplifier 5 for recording, and erasing current is passed to the wide head 6 of the main head 71. When always erasing before recording in each track, the erase mode is incorporated in the still picture recording mode SR. S1 and S2 at the contact point a are turned ON, and the others become turned OFF. At the composite circuit 4, FM luminance signals C S3 at the contact point a is turned ON, and others become turned OFF. The reproduction output from the narrow head 17 of the main head 71 is amplified at the amplifier 18, and demodulated similarly as in Fig. 5 or Fig. 8. This will repeatedly obtain the picture image signals for 1 field portion to reproduce the still picture. When the changing object is continuously pictured by still recording, it is generally difficult to smoothly reproduce moving pictures. Basically, it suffices if reproduction is conducted a plural number of times for the same track, then moves on to the next track to repeat the same procedure subsequently. However, when the head moves from one track to another track, the reproduced picture image becomes blurred. Fig. 16 b shows an example where a digital memory 82 for 1 field or 1 frame is shown instead of the auxiliary track. This is the same as the example shown in Fig. 16 a except for A D converter 83 and D A converter 84. Figs. 17 and 18 show the instances where the present invention is applied to a transmission system. In these figures, the like parts shown in Figs. 4, 5 and 8 are allotted the like numbers to simplify the explanation. The embodiment shown in Fig. 17 shows transmission of one color picture image signal. In the figure, the reference number 85 denotes a PM or FM angle modulator for luminance signals, 86 a transmission line, and 87 a PM or FM demodulator for carrier luminance signals. The carrier luminance signal allotted with bands and multiplexed PM color signals as shown in Fig. 2 are transmitted over the transmission line 86. Fig. 18 shows an example of transmitting two color picture image signals A and B. As in Fig. 3, the band zones are allotted for occupation by respective signals and multiplexed by rectangular 2 phase PM modulation respectively. In the figure, the reference numbers 1a and 1b denote PM modulator circuits which are similar to the PM modulator circuit 1 except that the former do not have a carrier oscillator. They obtain the carrier at the multiplexers 88 and 89. The reference numbers 22a and 22b denote PM demodulator circuits which are the same as the PM demodulator circuit 22 except for the pass band for the band pass filter, and 33a and 33b are the circuits with the same construction as the phase reference signal generating circuit 33 except for frequency. The present invention is now explained when applied generally to storing devices by way of Figs. 19 and 20. The example shown in Fig. 19 corresponds to that of Fig. 17 and is the same except that the storing device 90 is used instead of the transmission line 86. The example of Fig. 20 corresponds to that of Fig. 18 except for the use of a storing device in place of the transmission line 86. The storing device requires an amplifier on both the input side and the output side as the need arises similarly as in the transmission system. As a storing device 90, any of the like devices mentioned below may be used
