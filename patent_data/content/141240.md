# Method of stabilizing metal silica complexes in alkali metal halide brines.

## Abstract
A method for stabilizing a complex of aluminum and silica, particularly colloidal complexes in an alkali metal halide, particularly sodium chloride, brine used as an anolyte feedstock for membrane electrolytic cells. Such stabilization is achieved by modifying the startup procedure of the cell so as to promote a sufficient level of hydroxyl ion backmigration during electrolysis so as to keep the pH of said brine at a value about 3.5.
