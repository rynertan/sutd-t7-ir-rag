## Description
RESINOUS COMPOSITIONS Copolyester carbonate resins are well known thermoplastic materials which, due to their many advantageous mechanical properties, are finding increasing use as thermoplastic engineering materials. These copolyester carbonate resins exhibit, for example, excellent properties of toughness, flexibility, impact strength, optical clarity, and thermal resistance. However, these resins are generally somewhat difficult to process, and do not possess the requiste tensile modulus needed for certain applications. Resins such as polyphenylene ethers exhibit good tensile modulus and good processability, while resins such as polystyrenes exhibit excellent processability and good impact properties. Thus a multicomponent blend can be hypothesized on the bsis of blending resins possessing certain strong properties with resins exhibiting weaknesses in those same properties. However, certain practical considerations inhibit implementation of this theory. For example, not all resins are compatible with each other. Thus, blends of incompatible resins exhibit certain weaknesses and disadvantageous properties among which is the fact that the strong properties of certain resins do not complement or overcome the weaknesses in these same properties of the other resinous component in the blends. It is an object of the instant invention to provide blends in which the resinous components are compatible and in which the weaknesses of copolyester carbonate resins in the areas of tensile modulus and processability are offset by the strengths in these properties exhibited by polyphenylene ether resins or mixtures of polyphenylene ether resins and polystyrene resins. In accordance with the instant invention there is provided a novel composition comprised of, in physical admixture, i at least one copolyester carbonate resin, and ii at least one resin selected from polyphenylene ether resins or mixtures of polyphenylene ether resins and polystyrene resins. These blends exhibit good compatability of the components and can be molded into various articles. In accordance with the instant invention there is provided a blend exhibiting good compatability of its component parts comprised of i at least one copolyester carbonate resin, and ii at least one resin selected from polyphenylene ether resin or mixtures of polyphenylene ether and polystyrene resins. Briefly stated, the copolyester carbonates of this invention contain recurring carbonate groups, carboxylate groups, and aromatic carbocyclic groups in the linear polymer chain, in which at least some of the carbonate groups and at least some of the carboxylate groups are bonded directly to ring carbon atoms of the aromatic carbocyclic groups. These copolyester carbonates contain ester bonds and carbonate bonds in the polymer chain, wherein the amount of ester bonds is from about 25 to about 90 mole percent,, preferably from about 35 to about 80 mole percent. For example, 5 moles of bisphenol A reacting completely with 4 moles of ispohthaloyl dichloride and one mole of phosgene would give a copolyester carbonate of 80 mole percent ester bonds. The copolyester carbonates may be prepared by known conventional methods such as, for example, interfacial polymerization, melt polymerization, transesterification, etc. The copolyester carbonates and methods for their preparation are disclosed, inter alia, in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,169,121, 4,156,069, 4, 238,596 and 4,238,597, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. The copolyester carbonates may be conveniently prepared via the interfacial polymerization process by reacting a at least one dihydric phenol, b at least one ester precursor, and c a carbonate precursor.

The divalent hydrocarbon radicals represented by A include the arylene, alkylene, alkylidene. cycloalkylene, and cycloalkylidene radicals. The preferred arylene radicals are those containing from 6 to 12 ring carbon atoms, i.e., phenylene, naphthylene, and biphenylene.

The preferred cycloalkylene and cycloalkylidene radicals are those containing from 6 to about 16 ring carbon atoms. In the dihydric phenol compounds represented by Formula I R and R 1 may be the same or they may be different. When more than one R substituent is present they may be the same or different. Likewise, when more than one R 1 substituent is present they may be the same or different. Where b is zero in Formula I the aromatic rings are directly joined with no intervening alkylene or other bridging group. The positions of the hydroxyl groups and R and R 1 on the aromatic nuclear residues can be varied in the ortho, meta or para positions and the groups can be in a vicinal, asymmetrical or symmetrical relationship where two or more aromatic ring carbon atoms are substituted with R or R 1 and hydroxyl.

The preferred carbonate precursors are the carbonyl halides with carbonyl chloride being the preferred carbonyl halide. The ester precursor may be a difunctional carboxylic acid or and ester forming reactive derivative thereof. The difunctional carboxylic acids which are useful as the ester precursors include any difunctional carboxylic acid conventionally used in the preparation of linear polyesters. Generally, the difunctional carboxylic acids which may be used include the aliphatic carboxylic acids, the aliphatic aromatic carboxylic acids, and the aromatic carboxylic acids. These acids are described in U.S. Patent 3,169,121, which is incorporated herein by reference. The preferred difunctional carboxylic acids are the aromatic carboxylic acids. Particularly useful aromatic carboxylic acids are those of the formula EMI7.1 wherein R 5 is either a hydroxyl or carboxyl group R 4 is independently selected from alkyl radicals, preferably those containing from 1 to about 8 carbon atoms, and halogen radicals and m is a positive integer having a value of from 0 to 4 inclusive.

Some illustrative non limiting examples of these acid dihalides include isophthaloyl dichloride, terephthaloyl dichloride, and mixtures thereof. The copolyester carbonates of the present invention may be conveniently prepared by the interfacial polymerization process utilizing the dihydric phenols of Formula I, the ester precursors, the carbonate precursor, a water immiscible organic solvent such as methylene chloride, an aqueous caustic solution, a molecular weight regulator, and a catalyst.

These branching agents are well known in the art and are generally polyfunctional aromatic compounds containing at least three functional groups such as hydroxyl, carboxyl, haloformyl, anhydride, and mixtures thereof. Some illustrative non limting examples of these branching agents include trimellitic anhydride, trimellitic acid, trimellityl trichloride, 4 chloroformyl phthalic anhydride, pyromellitic acid, pyromellitic dianhydride, trimesic acid, and the like.Other organic polyfunctional compounds useful in making these randomly branched thermoplastic copolyester carbonates are disclosed, inter alia, in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,635,895 and 4,001,184, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. The high molecular weight thermoplastic aromatic copolyester carbonates of the instant invention generally have a weight average molecular weight in the range of from about 10,000 to about 200,000, preferably from about 25,000 to about 150,000. The styrene resins which may be used in the preparation of the instant compositions or blends are well known and are generally commercially available or may be readily prepared by well known and conventional methods. These styrene resins are described, inter alia, in U.S. Patent 3,383,435 Billmeyer, Fred, W., Jr., Textbook of Polymer Science, Interscience Publishers, New York, 1966, pages 383 386 and 394 400 and Teach, W.C. and Kiessling, G.C.

Particularly useful styrene containing copolymers are the acrylonitrile butadeine styrene resins ABS resin , the molecules of which contain two or more polymeric parts of different compositions that are bonded chemically. The polymer is preferably prepared by polymerizing conjugated dienes, such as butadiene or a conjugated diene with a monomer copolymerizable therewith such as styrene, to provide a polymeric backbone. After formation of the backbone, at least one grafting monomer, and preferably two, are polymerized in the presence of the prepolymerized backbone to obtain the graft polymer. These resins are prepared by methods well known in the art. The backbone polymer, as mentioned, is preferably a conjugated diene such as polybutadiene, polyisoprene, or a copolymer such as butadiene styrene, butadiene acrylonitrile, or the like. The specific conjugated diene monomers normally utilized in preparing the backbone of the graft polymer are generically described by the formula EMI12.1 wherein R is independently selected from hydrogen, lower alkyl groups, preferably those containing from 1 to about 5 carbon atoms, and halogens, preferably bromine or chlorine. Examples of dienes that may be used include butadiene, isoprene, 1,3 heptadiene, methyl 1,3 pentadiene, 2,3 dimethyl 1,3 butadiene, 2 ethyl 1,3 pentadiene, 1,3 and 2,4 hexadiene, chloro and bromo substituted butadienes such as dichlorobutadiene, bromobutadiene, and mixtures thereof, and the like. A preferred conjugated diene is butadiene. One monomer or group of monomers that may be polymerized in the presence of the prepolymerized backbone are monovinylaromatic hydrocarbons. The monovinyl aromatic monomers utilized are generically described by formula IV with the exception that Z is independently selected from lower alkyl radicals and halogen radicals. Examples of the monovinylaromatic compounds include styrene, 3 methylstyrene, 3,5 diethylstyrene 4 n propylstyrene, alpha methylstyrene, alpha methyl toluene, alpha chlorostyrene, alpha bromostyrene, mixtures thereof, and the like. The preferred monovinylaromatic compounds are styrene and alpha methylstyrene. A second group of monomers that may be polymerized in the presence of the prepolymerized backbone are acrylic monomers such as acrylonitrile, substituted acrylonitrile and or acrylic acid esters, exemplified by acrylonitrile, and alkyl acrylates such as methyl methacrylate. The acrylonitrile, substituted acrylonitrile, or acrylic acid esters are described generically by the formula EMI14.1 wherein R is as previously defined and R is selected from cyano and carbalkoxy wherein the alkoxy group of the carbalkoxy contains from 1 to about 12 carbon atoms.

In the preparation of the graft polymer, the conjugated diolefin polymer or copolymer exemplified by a 1,3 butadiene polymer or copolymer comprises about 50 by weight of the total graft polymer composition. The monomers polymerized in the presence of the backbone, exemplified by styrene and acrylonitrile, comprise from about 40 to about 95 percent by weight of the total graft polymer composition. The second group of grafting monomers, exemplified by acrylonitrile, ethyl acrylate or methyl methacrylate, of the graft polymer composition, preferably comprise from about 10 to about 40 by weight of the total graft copolymer composition. The monovinylaromatic compound exemplified by styrene comprises from about 30 to about 70 weight percent of the total graft polymer composition. In preparing the polymer it is normal to have a certain percentage of the polymerizing monomers that are grafted on the backbone combine with each other and occur as free copolymer. If styrene is utilized as one of the grafting monomers and acrylonitrile as the second grafting monomer a certain portion of the composition will copolymerize as free styrene acrylonitrile copolymer. In the case where the alpha methylstyrene or other monomer is substituted for the styrene in the composition used in preparing the graft polymer, a certain percentage of the composition may be an alpha methylstyrene acrylonitrile copolymer. Also, there are times when a copolymer, such as alpha methylstyrene acrylonitrile, is added to the graft polymer copolymer blend.When the graft polymer copolymer blend is referred to herein, it is meant optionally to include at least one copolymer blended with the graft polymer composition and which may contain up to about 90 of free copolymer. Optionally the elastomeric backbone may be an acrylate rubber, such as one based on n butyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, 2 ethylhexyl acrylate, and the like. Additionally minor amounts of a diene may be copolymerized in the acrylate rubber backbone to yield improved grafting with the matrix polymer. These ABS type resins are also well known in the art and are generally commercially available. The polyphenylene ethers are known polymers which are described, inter alia, in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,306,874, 3,306,875, 3,257,357 and 3,257, 348, all of which are incorporated herein by reference.

Particularly useful polyphenylene ethers are those containing recurring structural units represented by the general formula EMI17.1 wherein R 1 2 and R 1 3 are independently selected from methyl and ethyl radicals. Some illustrative non limiting examples of polyphenylene ethers include poly 2,6 dimethyl 1,4 phenylene ether, poly 2 methyl 6 ethyl 1,4 phenylene ether, and poly 2,6 diethyl 1,4 phenylene ether. The instant blends contain i at least one copolyester carbonate resin, and ii at least one resin selected from polyphenylene ether resins or mixtures of at least one polyphenylene ether resin and at least one polystyrene resin. The instant invention thus includes the following blends BLEND A containing i at least one copolyester carbonate resin, and ii at least one polyphenylene ether resins and BLEND B containing i at least one copolyester carbonate resin, ii at least one polyphenylene ether resin, and iii at least one polystyrene resin.

More preferably this mixture contains from about 25 to about 75 weight percent polyphenylene ether resin and from about 75 to about 25 weight percent polystyrene resin. The compositions of this invention are prepared by any conventional mixing methods. For example, one method involves mixing the copolyestercarbonate resin, polyphenylene ether resin, or polyphenylene ether resin and polystyrene resin in powder or granular form in an extruder and extruding the mixture into strands, chopping the strands into pellets and molding the pellets into the desired article. The compositions of the instant invention may optionally contain the well known and commonly used additives.

Some particularly useful flame retardants are the alkali and alkaline earth metals salts of organic sulfonic acids. These types of flame retardants are disclosed, inter alia, in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,933,734, 3,948,851, 3,926,908, 3,919,167, 3,909,490, 3,931,100, 3,978,025, 3,953,399, 3,917,599 3,951,910 and 3,940,366, all of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference. In order to more fully and clearly illustrate the present invention the following examples are set forth. It is intended that the examples be considered as illustrative rather than limiting the invention as disclosed and claimed herein. In the examples all parts and percentages are parts and percentages by weight unless otherwise specified. EXAMPLE 1 This example illustrates the preparation of a two component blend containing 1 part by weight of copolyester carbonate resin and 1 part by weight of polyphenylene ether resin. One part by weight of a solution containing one part by weight of copolyester carbonate resin dissolved in 9 parts by weight of chloroform is mixed with one part by weight of polyphenylene ether resin dissolved in 9 parts by weight of chloroform. The copolyester carbonate resin has an ester content of about 75 mole percent, said ester content being about 93 mole percent terephthalate and about 7 mole percent isophthalate. The polyphenylene ether resin is General Electric Company s NORYL TM resin. The resultant solution mixture is then cast into a thin film. The film is subjected to visual inspection and is found to be slightly cloudy. This is an indication that the two components are generally compatible with each other. EXAMPLE 2 This example illustrates the preparation of a three component blend containing 1 part by weight of copolyester carbonate resin, 0.5 part by weight of polyphenylene ether resin, and 0.5 part by weight of high impact polystyrene. One part by weight of a solution containing one part by weight of the copolyester carbonate of Example 1 dissolved in 9 parts by weight of chloroform is mixed with 0.5 parts by weight of a solution containing one part by weight of the polyphenylene ether of Example 1 dissolved in 9 parts by weight of chloroform, and with 0.5 part by weight of a solution containing one part by weight of high impact polystyrene U.S. Steel s high impact polystyrene 43 80 dissolved in 9 parts by weight of chloroform. The resultant solution mixture is solvent cast into a thin film and the film is subjected to visual inspection. The film is found to be transparent.This indicates good compatibility of the copolyester carbonate resin, the polyphenylene ether resin, and the high impact polystyrene resin. EXAMPLE 3 This example illustrates the preparation of a three component blend containing 3 parts by weight of copolyester carbonate resin, 0.5 part by weight of polyphenylene ether resin, and 0.5 part by weight of high impact polystyrene resin. A copolyester carbonate resin solution, a polyphenylene ether resin solution, and a high impact polystyrene solution are prepared substantially in accordance with the procedure of Example 2. Three parts by weight of the copolyester carbonate solution are then mixed with 0.5 part by weight of the polyphenylene ether solution and 0.5 part by weight of the high impact polystyrene solution. The resultant solution mixture is then solvent cast into a thin film. This thin film is subjected to visual inspection and is found to be transparent. This is an indication of good compatibility of the three components in the instant blends. EXAMPLE 4 This example illustrates the preparation of a three component blend containing 1 part by weight of copolyester carbonate resin, 1.5 parts by weight of polyphenylene ether resin, and 1.5 parts by weight of high impact polystyrene resin. A copolyester carbonate solution, a polyphenylene ether solution, and a high impact polystyrene solution are prepared substantially in accordance with the procedure of Example 2. One part by weight of the copolyester carbonate solution is mixed with 1.5 parts by weight of the polyphenylene ether solution and 1.5 parts by weight of the high impact polystyrene solution. The resultant solution mixture is then solvent cast into a thin film. This film is then subjected to visual inspection and is found to be transparent. This is an indication of good compatability of these three components. EXAMPLE 5 This example illustrates the preparation of a two component blend containing 1 part by weight of copolyester carbonate resin and 2 parts by weight of polyphenylene ether resin. One part of a copolyester carbonate resin of Example 1 is placed into a Hake rheocord torque rheometer and heated at 275 DEG C. until molten. To this molten copolyester carbonate resin are added, slowly, two parts by weight of a polyphenylene ether resin of Example 1. Heating is continued until the polyphenylene ether resin is molten. The molten blend is allowed to cool and solidify, and is then compression molded into test bars. The test bars are translucent and have second order glass transition temperatures of 166 DEG C. and 212 DEG C. The present invention provides a means for simultaneously upgrading many properties of copolyester carbonates and polyphenylene ethers and is predicated upon the discovery that the copolyester carbonates and the polyphenylene ethers, or copolyester carbonates, polyphenylene ethers, and polystyrenes are generally combinable over a wide range of proportions resulting in thermoplastic compositions having many properties improved over those of either copolyester carbonates or polyphenylene ethers alone. As an additional advantage of the instant invention it has been found that the blending of copolyester carbonates with either polyphenylene ethers or with mixtures of polyphneylene ethers and polystyrenes allows for custom formulation of compositions having predetermined properties ranging between those of copolyester carbonates and polyphenylene ethers by controlling the ratio of these components. This is somewhat unusual since blending of two or more polymers generally results in compositions displaying distinct sets of properties, i.e., one for each of the resinous components.
