# Rotary fluid seals.

## Abstract
A rotary fluid seal, especially an oil seal for a rotary shaft, comprises a sealing ring 7 between axially opposed divergent frusto conical counterfaces 13,14 of relatively rotatable members, preferably casing rings 1,2 in a self contained seal unit, the sealing ring 7 having a pair of divergent sealing lips 5,6 presenting frusto conical contact faces 11,12 to the counterfaces 13,14 and being substan tially coaxial with but floating freely between the relatively rotatable members, the contact faces bearing frictionally on the counterfaces so that, on relative rotation of the members 1,2 , the sealing ring is frictionally driven into rotation by one or other of the members and the effect of centrifugal force, tending to cause the sealing lips to flex angularly outwardly, reduces the bearing load of the contact faces on the counter faces.
