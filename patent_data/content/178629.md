# Positioning indexing control device for inverter apparatus.

## Abstract
A positioning indexing device for an inverter apparatus provided with an indexing command control circuit for making positioning and indexing control of an inverter apparatus with an induction motor connected thereto as a load adapted, upon receipt of an indexing command after the rotation of the motor has been stopped at a specific position, to read a new command for stopping at any other specific position and to allow the spindle of the motor to stop at the aimed stop position with its rigidity maintained, within one rotation thereof, and without presenting such phenomena as damped oscillation about the aimed stop position.
