# ROTARY GAS MACHINE.

## Abstract
A rotary gas machine of the the dual parallel shaft gear driven type. In the apparatus, a pinion shaft 4 carrying a pinion 3 is constituted by a flexible shaft, which is supported by damper bearings 6A, 6B each constituted by an anti friction bearing, thereby reducing the size of the apparatus as a whole and thereby decreasing the required power.
