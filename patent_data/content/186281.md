## Description
Improvements in or Reloting to Gouging and Holding Means The present invention concerns an improved gouging and holding means, especially but not exclusively for use in a shearing apparatus for ferro magnetic material, and to a method of gouging and holding material in a shearing apparatus. A typical cutting or shearing operation involves the steps of opening the cutting blades, advancing the feedstock between the blades and closing the blades to cut the product piece from the feedstock, It is often an advantage to hold the feedstock in position to prevent loss of material due to movement of the material just before and during the cutting operation. This is particularly important when cutting a predetermined length of material from a feedstock which is only just longer than the piece to be cut.In such circumstances the length of the overhanging product piece is often greater than the remaining feedstock and if some holding means are not employed the entire feedstock tends to fall through the blades before cutting can toke place, thereby leaving an oversized product piece in the product bin. In the past attempts have been made to overcome this problem by utilis ing clamping means situated before or after the cutting blades.Obviously if these are placed before the cutting blades they must be close to the blades. This presents problems in respect of the efficient operation of the moving blade. Similarly if the clamping means is placed after the blades it must move with the cutting blades during a shearing operation. Additionally, the clamping means cannot be applied when the material is being progressed through the blades and, when short lengths of feedstock are involved, this often means that they fall through prior to the clamping means being applied causing the problem referred to above. Another prior method is to support the feedstock on a table and to withdraw the table immediately before cutting.This also involves complicated moving apparatus. It is an object of the present invention to obviate or mitigate the difficulties encountered in the past when holding feedstock during a shearing operation. A well establisbed method of gauging the length of the product to be cut from the feedstock is to use the physical stop set at a required distance from the cutting edge of the cutting blades and advancing the feedstock against the stop prior to cutting. A problem encountered with this method is that the feedstock may not reach the stop or alternatively may strike the stop and rebound to a distance from the stop. Clearly in both these situations a correctly lengthed product piece is not cut off the feedstock. If a gouge stop is used in combination with a supporting table as mentioned above, retraction of the stop is necessary to allow the cut product to be removed. Alternatively the supporting table must be cleaned of cut product pieces before the next shearing operation. This can cause extended cycle time lnd may increase the chance of malfunction. These problems are mare apparent when the feedstock is of varying size and shape, as for example the shearing of scrap steel in the reclamation industry, particularly when close sizing of the product is required or where automatic processing is carried out. It is also an object of the present invention to obviate or mitigate these disadvantages. According to the present invention there is provided gauging and holding means for a machine for carrying out operations on ferro magnetic material, comprising a magnetic stop arranged at a predetermined distance from a work station whereby on advancing a workpiece towards the stop, due to magnetic attraction, it is held in contact with the stop as the operation is carried out. Preferably the stop is adjustably mounted such that the dis tance between it and the work station may be varied. Preferably the stop incorporates on electro magnet. Meons may be provided for energizing the electro magnet prior to and during an operation. The polarity of the magnet may be reversed after the operation to assist in removal of the finished workpiece. Preferably the work station comprises the blades of a metal shear. The metal shear is provided with a fixed blade at the end of a workpiece holding table, the table being mounted in a ferro magnetic framework which carries also the magnetic stop whereby with a ferro magnetic workpiece on the table and resting against the stop a magnetic circuit is completed. Further according to the present invention there is provided a method of gauging feedstock length and holding the gouged feedstock in CL predetermined position relative to the blades of a shear, comprising advancing the feedstock towards a magnetic stop located at a predetermined distance from the blades and magnetically attracting the feedstock against the stop during the shearing operation. Preferably after the shearing operation the magnetic attraction on the sheared feedstock is removed. Preferably the magnetic force is applied by energising an electro mognet assoc iated with the stop The polorisation of the electro magnet may be reversed after the shearing operation has been concluded. An embodiment of the present invention will now be described by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a sectional elevation on the line B B of Fig. 2 and Fig. 2 is a plan on the line A A of Fig. 1. A shear for cutting scrap metal comprises a table 1 on which a length of ferro mognetic feedstock 5 is supported. The table 1 is ferro magnetic and is supported on a ferro magnetic base member 11 which also supports a mounting member 8 for an electro magnet having a core 6 and electrical windings 9. The electro magnet is mounted on the support 8 by means of adjustable screws 7 so that the distance of its end face 6A from the leading edge of the table 1 may be adjusted. The leading edge of the table 1 is provided with the fixed lower blade 4 of a shear, the upper blade 3 being carried on a movable upper member or cutting head 2. Means not shown are provided for advancing the feedstock 5 across the table and against the face 6A. The means may comprise a conveyor, a moving table or simply an inclined surface but as they do not form part of the present invention will not be described in any detail in this specification. In operation, the means are activated to advance the feedstock beyond the lower cutting blade 4 such that its leading end abuts the end face 6A of the electro magnet. At this time or during feedstock movement the electro magnet is energised to attract the feedstock towards its end face 6A and magnetic attraction causes the feedstock end to be rigidly held against the face 6A so long as current is supplied to the windings 9. The head 2 can then be lowered to cause a shearing action between the upper and lower blades and cut off a product piece 10 of a predetermined precise length. It will be realised that even if the feedstock is of a length which is only just greater than the product length it will be held in the position shown in Fig. 1 during the shearing operation and will not topple off the end of the platform into the product bin. A closed magnetic circuit is provided by the electro magnet, its support 8, the base member 11, the table 1 and the feedstock 5 and this assists in the holding operation and tends to align the material on the table. The downward movement of the head 2 will tend to cause the product 10 to be removed from the electromagnet but removal can be enhanced by de energising the windings 9 or alternatively supplying current of reverse polarity to them so that the cut product is repelled from the end face 6A.Clearly in such a situation the polarity will be returned to normal as the feedback is advanced prior to the next shearing cycle. Various modifications can be made without departing from the scope of the invention. The arrangement can be incorporated in apparatus for working ferro magnetic workpieces other than a shear, for example a press or milling machine. In a further modification a permanent magnet may replace the electro magnet. Modified means for adjusting the spacing of the end face of the magnet 6A from the lower cutting blade 4 can be utilised, for example, spacing means rather than adjusting screws can be employed. Various other constructional features of the apparatus can be modified provided that there is always provided a magnetic stop arranged at a predetermined distance from the work station. Magnetic paths other than through the base member 11 may be arranged and the magnet may be pivotally or slidably mounted on the support 8 so that it may follow the movement of the head 2. The stop may have a stepped face facing the table 1 to provide a support for the end of a workpiece or workpieces held against it. The stop need not be fixed to the support 8 but could be fixed to the head 2 provided a magnetic circuit including the stop and the workpiece is maintained. In a further modification the support 8, the base member 11 or the table 1, or any combination of these could be non ferro magnetic so that magnetism is confined to the electro magnet 6, there bEing no magnetic circuit including the feedstock.
