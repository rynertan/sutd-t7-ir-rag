The bag is made from a plurality of piles 13 19 of flexible mate rial, such as kraft paper, which are cut and scored to permit a multiwall, gusseted, stepped end, pinch bottom bag to be formed and to further permit a valve area to be formed at one corner when the front wall 41 , rear wall 21 and gusset panels 29, 37 in that region are infolded. The valve sleeve 71 which is inserted into the valve area includes a tuck in flap 79, 81 which is sized and shaped to correspond to the pocket formed when the wall and gusset panels are folded back against the inside walls of the bag. When the bag is being as sembled, the tuck in flap 79, 81 is inserted into the pocket, aligned with the fold lines 47, 49, 51 defining the bottom and side edges of the pocket and secured therein by a suitable adhesive.
