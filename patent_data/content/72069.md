## Description
Method of producing preforms for drawing optical fibres and preforms obtained in accordance with this method and apparatus for the continuous production of optical fibres. The invention relates to a method for the continuous production of an optical fibre preform by depositing core and cladding glass from the vapour phase so as to form a rod shaped preform extending from a starting member and moving the starting member from the deposition zone at the same speed as the length of the preform increases. In the field of optical telecommunications there is an increasing demand for large size preforms for drawing optical fibres. A method producing preforms is disclosed inUnited States Patent Specification no. 4,062,665. In the process described in this United States Patent Specification glass, particles of core and cladding material are deposited onto a starting member. This results in a porous preform which thereafter has to be vitrified by heating. The preform can only be drawn into a fibre after this treatment. The present invention has for its object to provide a method of producing a large size solid preform from which without any intermediate treatment a fibre can be drawn. According to the invention, this object is accomplished by means of a method which is characterized in that core glass is deposited directly onto the starting member so as to form by means of a non isothe rmal plasmaactivated C.V.D. process a solid comumn of core glass extending from the starting member and that a solid glass cladding is directly deposited onto the core glass column by means of a non isothermal plasma activated C.V.D.process. A non isothermal plasma activated C.V.D. process is understood to mean a deposition process in which a plasma which is commonly referred to as a cold plasma is used for activating the deposition. in such a plasma only electrons have a high kinetic energy. With such a plasma it is even possible to bring gas mixtures to reaction which cannot be activated thermally.It has further been found that lshen a non isothermal plasmaactivated C.V.D. process is used glass layers are deposited directly from the gas phase at a comparatively lolls temperature. Subsenent heating with the object of vitrifying the deposited material, as is necessary in prior art processes flame hydrolysis, V.A.D. in which glass soot is deposited, may be dispensed with in the process used according to the invention. This may mean a saving in time and energy compared with prior art processes. With the method according to the invention it is possible to produce preforms suitable for drawing optical fibres of the so called stepped index type as well as preforms suitable for drawing optical fibres of the so called graded index type. In the first case core glass of a constant composition is deposited with a refractive index which is greater than the refractive index of the cladding glass. In the second case the composition of the core glass is varied such that the refractive index of the core glass increases towards the axis of the core glass column formed. The method can easier be modified in such a manner that a preform is produced which grows continuously at one end and which is drawn into an optical fibre at the other end. In the method according to the invention the customary starting materials may be used and preforms of a conventional composition can be produced. The starting materials are oxygen and silicon tetracliloride to wffiiich a constant or a varying quantity of GeCl4, POCl3, or SC1 SiF4 may be added to increase or decrease respec 3 SiF4 tively the refractive index. Also combinations of these materials and possibly other materials which are commonly referred to as dopants are possible. In the description of the V.A.D. technique see the above mentioned USP 4to62,663 it is stated that plasma torches may alternatively be used to produce the glass particles these plasmas are of an isothermal character. In such torches the plasma is produced by mixing intensely heated argon with the reaction gases. This process also has the disadvantage that the preform must be sintered before it can be drawn into an optical fibre. A further disadvantage of the prior art VAD technique is that when this process is used, it must be ensured that the coefficient of thermal expansion of the core glass is equal to the coefficient of thermal expan sion of the cladding glass as otherwise cracks occur during sintering. In accordance with the said USP 4,062,665 this is accomplished in that the core glass is doped with GeO2 and the cladding glass with B203 The difficulties encountered with graded index fibres cannot be solved in this manner unless a transition zone doped with both GeO2 and B203 is used. In the method in accordance with the invention this measure is not required.Neither during the manufacture of the preform, nor during drawing into optical fibres do cracks occur in the preforms when, for example, the cladding glass consists of pure SiO2 and the core glass of a mixture of SiO2 and GeO2. A number of embodiments of the invention will now be explained in greater detail by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawing. In this drawing Figure 1 shows schematically an embodiment of an apparatus for producing a preform for an optical fibre of the stepped index type. Figure 2 shows schematically an embodiment of an apparatus for producing a preform for an optical fibre of the graded index type and Figure 3 shows schematically an embodiment of an apparatus for producing preforms and drawing optical fibre therefrom continuously and simultaneously.Embodiment 1 see Figure 1 . A rod shaped starting member 2 of pure quartz is inserted in a tubular reaction chamber 1 of, for example, quartz to prevent contaminations by metals and to enable visual control of the progress of the deposition process and to enable optical measurements to be made on the preforms being formed. Microwave cavities 3 and 4 which are connected to a microwave generator not shown are arranged around the reaction chamber 1. In addition, the tubular reaction chamber 1 has three gas inlet tubes two of which 3A 5E are shown and whose openings are arranged at 1200 intervals with respect to each other around the circumference of the reaction chamber 1.The starting materials for forming the cladding glass 6 are conveyed through these tubes 5A 5E . The tubular reaction chamber 1 further comprises an inlet tube 7 whose axis coincides in the embodiment of Figure 1 with the axis of the raction chamber 1.The starting materials for the formation of core glass material 8 are fed into the reaction chamber 1 through this tube 7. The other end of the reaction chamber is provided with a gas outlet pipe 9 and a pump 10 for discharging gaseous reaction products C12 02 . At the beginning of the process, one end of the starting rod 2 is in that position in the reaction chamber 1 where a plasma is formed by means of the microwave cavity 3. Thereafter a mixture of oxygen and silicon tetrachloride and a dopant, for example GeC14, is fed into the tube. The plasma 3A is ignited, resulting in a core glass consisting of an intimate mixture of SiO and Ge02 being deposited onto the starting rod 2. Rod 2 is moved to the right see horizontal arrow at such a speed that, the starting materials being supplied continuously, a column 8 of core glass material is formed. It is advantageous to rotate the starting rod 2 during the deposition process. After a column of a predetermined length has been formed, starting materials for the formation of cladding glass material is passed through the inlet tubes 5A 5B , whose openings are located between the microwave cavities 3 and 4 and the plasma inside the microwave cavity 4 is ignited. It is recommendable to have the process proceed in such a manner that also cladding glass material is deposited onto the circumference of rod 2. In this way a firm bond is obtained between the preform 8, 6 being formed and the starting rod 2. This bonding region may at a later stage also serve to clamp the preform during the fibre drawing operation.By means of ovens, not shown, in places where material is being deposited, the temperature is maintained between 1000 End 12000C, preferably at 11500C. During the entire deposition process the starting rod 2 and the preform being formed are preferably rotated. In a practical case the inside diameter of the tubular reaction chamber 1 was 3 cm. The chamber consisted of a quartz tube having a wall thickness of 1 mm. A gas mixture consisting of 2 9 n cm3 min , SiC14 30 n cm3 mixture consisting of 2 n n min and GeC14 3 n cm3 min was fed through the gas inlet tube 7 into the reaction chamber. The frequency of the electric field in the microwave cavity 3 was 2.45 GHz. Thereafter a gas mixture consisting of 02 600 n cm3 min and SiC14 120 n cm3 min was fed into the reaction chamber through the inlet tubes 5A and 513. The frequency of the electric field in the microwave cavity 4 was also 2.45 GHz. The deposition process was activated by means of the formed plasmas 3A and 4A. A preform having an overall diameter of 10 mm was formed at a rate of 0.15 cm min. The diamter of the starting rod 2 was 5 mm. A stepped index fibre having a 50 um diameter core and an overall diameter of 125 um and a length of 1 km was drawn from the formed preform length 20 cm . It is obvious that the reaction chamber 1 may alternatively be arranged vertically.Further, it is possible to use more than two microwave cavities and to have mixtures of starting materials which flow into the reaction chamber 1 in more than to places. In this manner a plurality of layers of core glass of different compositions and refractive indices may be deposited on top of each other, for example for the formation of a preform for drawing an optical fibre of the graded index type. Embodiment 2 see Figure 2 . Figure 2 shows schematically an embodiment of a method for the continuous production of a preform for the drawing of optical fibres of the graded index type. In this method, one plasma is used which is generated by means of the microwave cavity 29. The deposition reaction is performed in a cylindrical, quartz glass reaction chamber 28 having a number of inlet tubes 21 to 27, inclusive and 21t to 26 inclusive, respectively. A mixture of SiCl4 and GeC 14 is passed through the tubes 21 to 24, inclusive and 27 to 94 , inclusive , the SiCl4 to GeCl4 ratio in the mixture increasing from 21 to 24 and from 21 to 24 .Oxygen is fed through the tube 27. SiC14 is supplied through the tubes 25 and 26 and 25 and 26 for forming cladding glass. By carefully harmonizing the composition of the supplied gases, the degree to which the deposited core glass material is doped can be controlled. When more inlet tubes are used and the flow rate of the gas in increased, a higher deposition rate may be used. The temperature at the surface of the preform being formed is maintained at a temperature between 1100 and 12000C. This prevents chlorine from being built into the deposited glass. The temperature can be adjusted by means of the power which is dissipated in the plasma. In all other respects the process is carried out in the same way as described with reference to embodiment 1 also here the preform 8 6 being formed is rotated during the deposition process.In the apparatus which is schematically shown in Figure 3, corresponding reference numerals have the same meaning as in Figures 1 and 2. InFigure 3 there are further schematically sholvm a microwave generator 31, supporting wheels 32 and 33 and an oven 34. Figure 3 shows, that at one end a preform for drawing an optical fibre of the stepped index type is being formed while at the other end this preform is drawn into a fibre.For this purpose oxygen via inlet pipe 27 and a mixture of SiC14 and Gel4 via the inlet pipes 21 and 21 and 4 1Sill4 via the respective inlet pipes 25 and 26 and 25 and 26 are passed into the reaction chamber 28. A core 8 of GeO,, SiO,, glass and a cladding 6 of SiO2 is formed. The plasma is generated by means of the microwave cavity 29 which is connected to a schematiclly shown microwave generazor 31. By means of the pump 10 reactive gases are pumped from the reaction chamber 28 and a reduced pressure i3 maintained in the reaction chamber 28 . Using a reduced pressure rnd guide wheels which can be rotated at an adjustable speed two of these wheels are shown in theFigure 32 and 33 it is possible to move the preform at a cons tat rate from the reaction chamber 28 and to draw simultaneously at the bottom side a fibre for which pupose an oven 33 heats the preform in that region to the drawing temperature approximately 20000C , a drawing device not shown being present. With an arrangement of this type it is possible to continuously produce high grade optical fibres at a high production rate.
