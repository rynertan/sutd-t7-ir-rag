# PYRIDYLETHYLAMINOFLUORANS

## Abstract
2 and or 6 pyridylethylamino substituted fluorans useful as color formers, particularly in pressure sensitive carbonless duplicating systems and thermal responsive marking systems are prepared by the interaction of pyridylethylaminophe nyl carbonylbenzoic acids with 4 hydroxy or alkoxyanilines or by the interaction of disubstituted aminophenyl carbonylben zoic acids with N pyridylethyl 4 hydroxy or alkoxy acetani lides. The pyridylethylaminophenyl carbonylbenzoic acid in termediates required for the fluorans are prepared by interact ing a N pyridylethyl 3 hydroxyaniline with a substituted or un substituted phthalic anhydride. The N pyridylethyl 4 hydroxy or alkoxyanilines and the N pyridylethyl 3 hydroxyanilines are prepared by interacting the respective aniline with a vinylpyri dine.
