# FLUID VALVE

## Abstract
The invention relates to a fluid valve, in particular for use as a throttle valve in an internal combustion engine. The valve has a flow path 25 for the air 26 defined by a tube having flexible wall 14 which separates the tube from an adjacent chamber 36 , so that a change in the pressure within the chamber 36 deforms the flexible wall 14 and thus causes a change in the internal cross section of the passage 25 . When the valve is in its closed position, air can still flow through an air bypass passage 46 .
