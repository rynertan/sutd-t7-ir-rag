## Description
IMMUNOREACTIVE SOLID PHASEThe present invention refers to a process for activating a solid polymer surface by radiation grafting and the activated solid phase obtained. The invention also refers to a process for preparing an immunoreactive solid phase wherein biologically active molecules are covalently bound to the activated solid phase, as well as the immunoreactive solid phase obtained.Specifically the invention also refers to the use of said immunoreactive solid phase in immunoassay.In order to adapt polymeric materials to given functions and environmental demands it is often desirable to be able to modify the surface properties. It might for instance be a question of changing a hydrofobic surface into a hydrofilic, preparing substances with biocompatible characteristics or selective membranes. Another important application is surface binding of chemically or biologically active molecules, which are in this way immobilized and can act as reagents or catalysts.By means of antibodies directed against a special antigen very sensitive assay methods can be developed, so called immunoassays IA . If any included reagent is labelled with an isotope one speaks of radio immuno assay RIA and if a reagent is labelled with an enzyme, correspondingly of enzyme immuno assay EIA . If larger amounts of antibody are used preparative systems might instead be developed.A general problem with IA is to obtain a convenient separation of labelled reacted reagent from free labelled reagent.Separations and or adsorptions based on differences in size or charge have been used. A better way is to immobilize either the antibody or the antigen. If the reagent is bound to a solid phase already when added to the reaction mixture one speaks about solid phase 1 technique. It is also possible to immobilize the reagent in a separate step by adding a secondary antibody directed against the antibody taking part of the reaction, the so called double antibody technique.There are many advantages with the solid phase methods inIA which have been used to a great extent. As solid phase has been used cellulose in the form of beads or paper discs and plastic surfaces as PVC, polystyrene and polymethacrylates.The ideal solid phase should be able to bind irreversibly large amounts of the reagent per surface unit. No reagent taking part in the reaction should in any significant amount bind unspecifically to the solid phase background In order to bind the reagent to the surface expensive chemicals should not be required, the process should be simple, it should be mild to the actual reagents antibody and antigen , and the active groups on the surface should be stable in order to make it possible to store the material and bind the reagent at another time.There is no presently available solid phase which fulfills these criterions. The solid phase described in this invention fulfills all the criterions.Cellulose particles, Sepharose particles or slips of paper, which have been activated with cyanogen bromide Axen et al.,Nature 214 1302, 1967 can be used as a solid phase. This solid phase certainly has a high capacity for irreversible linking of protein reagent, but the background is so high that it can only be used for certain applications. Thus, it is well adapted for assay of IgE and antibodies of IgEtype against different antigens but not as well or not at all for determining IgG antibodies. Another practical disadvantage is that the solid phase to which the reagent is coupled by the experimentator has to be placed in a test tube or the like before the assay. In addition a special equipment is required for the washing steps always being a part of an IA.This type of solid phase is commercially available Pharmacia Diagnostics and is constantly used for analyzing proteins in general as well as specific antibodies ofIgE type.Another type of solid phase mainly used in EIA is PVC and polystyrene to which a reagent has been passively adsorbed.This means that the reagents are reversibly bound to the plastic surface by means of unspecified forces. The degree of binding depends among other things on the charge of the reagents and in certain systems a strong binding of polysaccharides is obtained. Different proteins show different binding properties, in our investigations low values were obtained for human serum albumin, intermediary values for human IgG and moderately high values for human IgM. The advantage of this system is that the background is low, which makes it possible to determine IgG antibodies against different antigens.Plastic cuvettes in the shape of so called microtiter plates are commercially available, where the optical properties of the plastic make it possible to perform the photometric reading of the colour, the formation of which is catalyzed by the enzyme, directly in the reaction cuvette without any need of transferring into a separate glass cuvette. The washing procedures are also simpler than in those cases, as mentioned above about CNBr activated cellulose, as the reagents are bound directly to the inside of the tube or the cuvette in which the EIA reaction is performed.The drawbacks are that the binding is reversible, not specific for proteins, that the degree of binding varies with the charge of the proteins that large variations can appear owing to the quality of the plastic surface of the tubes or microtiter plates from one manufacturing batch to another and that compared to for instance the CNBr method an unsufficient amount of reagent can be adhered to a given area. SE 400 565 describes another solid phase technique, based on the formation of a hydrogel on a polymeric film to which biologically active molecules can be covalently bound. The method described can however not be used to graft for instance tubes or microtiter plates, as the liquid phase is gelling to a plug hard to remove. In using a solid phase coated or grafted with thick hydrogels the background will in addition be unacceptably high, which strongly reduces the sensitivity and the specificity of the test.By means of the present invention chemical groups can be grafted on the surface of plastic as a thin film 100 nm for the preparation of an activated solid phase, which can be utilized for covalent linking of proteins. This surface specific method has a capacity per surface area that can be made independent of the charge of the proteins, that is irreversible, and that does not affect the optical properties of the plastic surface, why the cuvettes in the microtiter plate in the same way as in passive adsorption, can be read directly in a photometer. The plastic surface to which active groups have been added is stable and can be stored for a long time, for several months at room temperature, which means that in a technical scale production one is not dependent on that the activation of the plastic surface and the coupling of protein takes place continuously. This must be regarded to be a great advantage.By the process of the invention a solid polymer surface is activated by radiation grafting of vinyl monomers having at least one functional group, which can be bound to biologically active molecules.In order to bind new molecules to a polymeric surface this has to have some kind of active centra comprising functional groups such as for instance OH, NH2, COOH, CHO, NCO, SCO. These centra advantageously can be prepared by surface grafting of the polymer by radiation. In many applications of polymer materials, the chemical and physical properties of the surfaces are as important as the properties exhibited by the bulk material. This realization has stimulated several groups to develop methods for chemical modification of the surface of polymers. The most common surface modification technique involves electron beam or y irradiation of the sample followed by free radical initiated, graft polymerization A. Shapiro, RadiationChemistry of Polymers , Interscience Publishers, New York, 1962 .Surface modification via grafting reactions has been performed both in situ, by irradiation of the polymer surface in the presence of a reactive monomer, and by pre irradiation followed by exposure to monomer in a subsequent step. The grafting reaction has, in turn, been carried out in two ways.Either the irradiated sample has been transferred in vacuo to a chamber in which the grafting reaction takes place or exposed to oxygen during or immediately after the irradiation. This latter process results in the formation of intermediate peroxides and hydroperoxides on the polymer surface which can be subsequently thermolyzed to form alkoxy radicals that function efficiently in the initiation of graft polymerization.Radiation induced free radical graft polymerization has also been accomplished using W light. Here, polymer samples were irradiated in a solution containing a vinyl monomer and a photosensitizer or were irradiated after the surface of the sample was saturated with such a solution. There are a few reports describing high energy radiation induced, ionic graft polymerization. Evidence for an ionic mechanism is generally the successful grafting of a monomeric species, such as vinyl ether, that is not prone to radical initiated polymerization.Among polymers which are convenient to use in this connection could be mentioned polystyrene, polyethylene, poly propylene, poly 4 methylpentylene, polyvinyl chloride, polyester, polymethyl methacrylate.A solution of the substance to be grafted on the surface is then irradiated with an adequate radiation dose under an inert atmosphere. The irradiation can be performed with radiation such as ultraviolet or ionizing radiation nucleid, electronic, plasma . The temperature at the irradiation can be selected within a broad range, low temperatures being of advantage to prevent changes in optionally present biologically active substances intended to be immobilized at the surface of the object.The process for activating a solid polymer surface of the invention is characterized in that the polymer surface is grafted in solution in a chain transfer reducing solvent at a monomer concentration below 3 by weight when the vinyl monomer is 1 mono or 1,1 disubstituted in order to prevent homopolymerization and an uncontrolled autocatalytic reactionThe vinyl monomer to be grafted on the polymer surface can be described by the formulaEMI6.1 wherein at least one of R1 R4 comprises a functional group, which can be covalently bound to a biologically active molecule. If R1 and R2 or R3 and Rq respectively are both hydrogen, the monomer is said to be 1 mono or 1,1 disubstituted. If on the other side R1 and R2 or R3 and R4, respectively1 are not both hydrogen the monomer is said to be 1,2 substituted.Vinyl monomers which can be used in accordance with the invention are for instance crotonic acid, acrylic acid, acrylic acid esters, acrylamide, bisacrylamide, methylol acrylamide, acrylated amines, acrylated epoxides, acrylated ethers, acrylated polyesters, acrylated polyurethanes, acrylated acrylates, acrylated silicons, acrylated silanes, acrylated phosphates and acrylated titanates, acrolein, phenyl substituted styrene derivatives as p aminostyrene, tiglic acid, senecioic acid, angelic acid, cinnamic acid etc.In order to get useful surfaces for high resolution affinity chromatography it is essential to be able to control the surface modification reaction. If an uncontrolled reaction takes place the data will be more or less useless. This is often the case if an unappropriate solvent or a too high monomer concentration 10 w w is choosen. It is very easy to start an autocatalytic polymerization reaction theTromsdorff effect where the rate cannot be controlled.According to the invention the grafting can be controlled by using a very low monomer concentration e.g. about 2 w w when the vinyl monomer is 1 mono or 1,1 disubstituted in combination with an appropriate solvent or by using 1,2 disubstituted vinylmonomers like crotonic acid. These monomers only form di or trimeres on the surface and cannot undergo homopolymerization. Crotonic acid grafting according to the invention will always give a very well defined graft layer, due to the probable fact that further free radical reactions are inhibited by the molecular configuration of the monomer molecules e.g. steric hindrance and thus, further polymerization will not occur. The graft layer obtained will be very close to a monomolecular one.This is considered to be a novel and important advantage.This can be discussed in terms of solid phase topography and it is believed that the solid phases commonly used today, cellulose discs, agarose gels, Sepharose and Sephadex particles etc. are inferior in that aspect. In many instances the porous nature of these solid phases demonstrate a complex array of undesirable unspecific affinity reactions towards the reagent components in a given immunoassay system. That may be due to pure mechanical trapping of reagent molecules but also depending on cooperating hydrofobic, polar non polar or local charge effects in a highly 3 dimensional solid phase. With the solid phases prepared according to our invention those side effects are minimized in that their topography may be described as close to 2 dimensional. In preparing solid phases with easy polymerizable vinyl monomers it is thus important to minimize the degree of further polymerization in order to get a thin, definable graft layer. In that aspect it is essential to keep the monomer concentration low in the grafting solution. Another alternative would be to perform the grafting process with the monomer present in a gaseous state.Further polymerization induced and generated by free radical formation can also be inhibited or limited by the presence of hydrated protons.The solvent for the graft substance which during the irradiation shall cover the surface to be grafted has been defined as a chain transfer reducing solvent which in addition must not be detrimental to the plastic material. By chain transfer reducing solvent is here intended a solvent which when irradiated forms radicals not being able to initiate polymerization. As examples of suitable solvents can be mentioned methanol, pyridine, water and mixtures of methanol water. The shape of the polymer is arbitrary and its size can vary within broad limits. It might for instance have a regular geometric shape which is for instance the case with discs, rods, reagent plates, sheets, bands, spheres etc. but it can also have an irregular shape.As mentioned above a general advantage of our invention is that as solid phase substrate can be used commercially available surfaces, for instance test tubes and microliter plates which are of interest for IA. By this a flexible system is obtained for those who want to prepare reagents for IA as there are many different microtiter plates and tubes available. In addition there is of course a possibility to utilize quite different physical shapes of plastic for instance capillaries, the internal surface of which could be lined by active groups, to which reagents are linked covalently or small sticks, which are treated correspondingly and at the performance of the IA test are dipped into a biological specimen, for instance urine.In the process for preparing an immunoreactive solid phase of the invention, biologically active molecules are bound to the functional groups on the activated solid phase.By the use of coupling methods known per se said active molecules can be linked covalently to the plastic surface.As examples of coupling methods can be mentioned reaction with glutaraldehyde, cyanogen bromide, hydrazine, bisepoxyranes, divinyl sulfone, carbonyl diimidazole and other reagents being statedin the handbook from IBF LKB, Practical guide for use in affinity chromatography and related techniques , Reactifs IBF Society Chimiques Pointet Girard,FR, 1983.The biologically active molecules can, however, also only be adsorbed to the plastic surface wherein a so called secondary binding or ionic binding is used. By secondary binding is here intended a binding which has been achieved by means of dispersive forces, polar forces or hydrogen bondings.Biologically active molecules are for instance enzymes, hormones, antibiotics, pharmaceuticals, haptens, antigens and antibodies.The immunoreactive solid phase of the invention comprising a polymer substrate with surface grafted functional groups to which biologically active molecules have been covalently linked can be used for quantitative or qualitative determination of antigen or antibody in an immunoassay. Immunoreactive solid phases prepared according to our invention have, when used in various immunoassay systems, proven to be superior to many of the commonly used commercial ones. The field of application is very wide. Coupling of a biologically active component which functions as an antigen in a specific antibody antigen equilibrium reaction, could thus be used for determination of absolute or relative levels of specific antibodies to the solid phase attached antigen. The widespread method of RAST PaperRadio Allergo Sorbent Test, Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden for the determination of IgE specific antibodies to common allergens, uses cellulose discs with covalently linked allergen. This method is suitable for detection of specific antibodies of the IgE but not of the IgG class, due to high unspecific binding in the latter case.After preparing microtiter plates with covalently linked timothy allergen in accordance with the invention seasonal variations of timothy specific IgG antibodies in allergic children could be studied in an EIA L. Nordvall et al to be published ,Such a study was impossible to perform with commercially available RAST timothy discs. Some comparisons can be made between immunoassays performed with solide phases prepared according to our invention and commercially used ones.Determination of total IgE levels in human serum Commercial method PRIST Paper Radio Immuno Sorbent Test,Pharmacia a radio immunoassay performed on paper discs.Lower detection limit 120 pg IgEUpper I 5 10 ng IgEEIA in polystyrene microtiter plates of the Invention ex. 8 Lower detection limit 10 pg IgEUpper 5 10 ng IgEDetermination of timothy allergen specific IgE levels in human serum Commercial method RAST Pharmacia a radioimmunoassay performed on paper discs.Lower detection limit 50 g IgEEIA in polystyrene microtiter plates of the invention exit Lower detection limit 1 pg Ig On comparison with routinely used EIA methods, based on passive adsorption, for determination of specific IgG levels against different antigens it has consequently been found that immunoreactive solid phases prepared according to the invention gave an average of a 50 100 times higher resolution.On outlining the general immunoassay applicabilities and advantages of our invention, an overall general preparation scheme could serve as a useful example.Stage I Preparation of an activated solid phase the grafting processThe choice of a suitable polymer substrate is not in any way limited but the apparent major advantage is that commercially available plastic materials will do perfectly well. Examples of cheap suitable materials are PVC, and or polystyrene test tubes, microtiter or tissue plates, and Petri dishes. Depending on the monomer which is to be grafted on to the polymeric substrate there are two different strategies to be aware of a if the vinyl monomer is 1,2 disubstituted, e.g. crotonic, senecioic and tiglic acid, a 10 by weight monomer solution should be used b if the vinyl monomer is 1 mono or 1,1 disubstituted, e.g. acrylic acid, a solution which contains the monomer in less than 3 by weight is essential for reproducible results and should be used.Methanol water in a 1 1 by weight proportion has throughout been used as a solvent.The reasons behind the choice are that the polymer in contrast to the graftmonomer substrate must be practically non soluble in the solvent and it must function as an effective electron capturer. The presence of oxygen inhibits the grafting reaction and makes it important to use carefully deaireated monomer solutions.Fifteen minutes under nitrogen will bring the oxygen concentration down from 1 mM to a sufficient 10 AM. Thus stage I comprises the use of for instance 10 by weight crotonic acid in aMeOH H2O 1 1 by weight solutions substrate or a 2.5 by weight of for instance acryl amide in the same solvent, preferably added with up to 20 mM nitric acid, on a polymeric substrate it also comprises the use of high energetic radiation for the induction of the ree radical reaction, which under these conditions will occur mainly on the surface of the polymeric substrate. Optimum conditions for polystyrene grafting in a gammaradiation source e.g. 60Co are a total 2.5 3 MRad delivery at a rate of approximately 0.25 MRad h.However, one of the crucial differences and novelties of the invention is the use of low graft monomer concentrations when highly polymerizable vinyl compounds are to be grafted. On using previously described concentrations e.g. 10 20 by weight the result will be not an ultrathin, well deflned grafting layer, but a thick, extensively polymerized gel plug. Utilizing such a reactive solid phase for immunoassay purposes would in many instances bring back the general background problems, previously discussed. It should also be stressed that a reactive solid phase prepared in that way cannot be used in a colorimetric EIA test where one wish to use for instance the individual wells in a microtiter plate as cuvettes, as the optical properties of the polymeric substrate will be destroyed. Stage II Reacting an activated solid phase requirements for covalent binding of immunoassay solid phase reagents e.g. biologically active molecules There are today a lot of commonly used and known methods for covalent coupling. The functional groups of the grafted surface and the chemical properties of the biologically active component, which is to be covalently linked, will govern the choice of a suitable condensating agent. We have mainly been working with solid phase carboxyl and amino groups and protein crosslinking by means of water soluble carbodiimides or glutaraldehvde.The use of carbodlimide crosslinking is somewhat limited by the reuieent of pure or highly refined biologically active components, because of the advantage to work at their isoelectric point, in order to achieve optimal binding conditions. Glutaraldehyde permits working in a wider pH range under coupling conditions and might in that aspect be considered as a more generally useful and among other things also a much cheaper condensating agent.The solid phase of the invention can also be utilized in other applications than IA.White blood cells and tumor cells can be identified and characterized by means of cell surface markers. This test can be performed by mixing for instance fresh sheep blood cells with a suspension of human white blood cells. Certain types of white blood cells will then link several sheep blood cells forming a so called rosette. By means of particles of plastic or copolymers to the surface of which specific substances have been bound, sheep blood cells can be substituted and also other types of reagents be developed, being able to identify other types of white blood cells.By means of our invention polystyrene particles having active chemical groups on the surface can be used.By using more material in order to get a greater amount of reagents available the solid phase technology can also be used for the purpose of separation.Our invention could also be used in other medical connections where tissue compatible surfaces optionally having specific reagents covalently linked are desirable.The invention can also be used in other connections when proteins or of course carbohydrates, if desired, are to be linked specifically to active groups on a polymer surface.The invention will be illustrated by the following examples. GRAFTING PROCESSTo a solution of methanol H2O 1 1 by weight is added 10 by weight crotonic acid. This solution was bubbled with nitrogen gas N This mixture was added to a microtiter plate e.g. 23 or tube in an inert atmosphere. The tube and or microtiter plate is sealed if necessary to maintain the inert atmosphere.This specimen is irradiated with a radiation dos is of 0.1 5 Mrad dependent on the conditions such as the plastic materIal, solvent composition, monomer. For instance a microtiter plate of PS, the solution mentioned above and a radiation dosis of about 3 Mrad. then ionizing radiation from 60Co of 0.25 Mrad h is used the specimen will be irradiated for 10 12 hours. The irradiated specimen is washed with distilled H2O before being ready for use.The same process can be utilized for grafting with acrylic acid, but the monomer concentration is then lower, 2.5 by weight, to avoid gelling. Grafting of for instance acrylamide, 2 hydroxy ethyl acrylate and 2 hydroxy ethyl methacrylate can be performed in a similar manner but in order to limit extensive polymerization the monomers must be kept at low concentrations e.g. 3 by weight .BINDING CAPACITY Example 1 Object The purpose of the following example was to quantify the protein binding capacity of a grafted polyvinyl chloride PVC surface as a function of available carbolic groups on the surface which can be carbodiimide coupled. A comparative test was made between a grafted polvcarboxy ic acid acrylic acid and a grafted monocarboxylic acid crotonic acid .Performance PVC microtiter plates flat bottomed 280 pl.r Flow Lab. were grafted with crotonic aid and acrylic acid respectively as to the process reference is made to the separate description . After the grafting process 3 h, 0.31 Mrad h, 60Co, N2 atmosphere the plates were washed with distilled water and allowed to dry. The plates were then kept in plastics bags at 20 C until they were used. 400 pg human gammaglobulin HGG, Kabi in 1 ml phosphate buffered physiological saline was labelled with 0.5 mCi 18.5 MBq Na125 I Amersham, England by means of lodo Beads Pierce Chem. Coy , USA according to the directions of the producer.The labelled protein was transferred into a 3 mM phosphate buffer pH 6.3 , called coupling buffer, by passage over a Sephadex G25 M column PD10, Pharmacia in accordance with the directions of the producer, equilibrated with coupling buffer. The protein concentration was adjusted to 100 pg ml. 1 ml labelledHGG was mixed with 1 ml unlabelled HGG 1.9 mg ml in coupling buffer . This gave a protein concentration of 1000 pg ml. A serial dilution in coupling buffer was also made to give the following concentrations 500, 200, 100 and 10 pg ml. To every well in two PVC plates, grafted with crotonic acid and acrylic acid respectively was added 50 pl of different protein concentrations. Then 50 311 EDAC 1 ethyl 3 53 di methylaminopropyl2 carbodiimide HCl, mw 191.7 g mol Bio Rad dissolved in coupling buffer was added. The concentration of EDAC was 100 pg ml. The plates were sealed with selfadherent plastic film and placed in a shaker at 4 C over night incubation time N18 h . The following day the incubation solution was aspirated and the plates were washed ten times with phosphate buffered saline 0.15 M pH 7.4 , containing 0.1 Tween 20 Kebo . Bound radioactivity was then measured in a y counter Multigamma, LKB .Result By relating measured cpm values to added total activity and known protein concentration the bonded protein could be quantified. The linking capacity was plotted as a function where log nanogram linked protein f log nanogram added protein . Acrylic acid turned out to give a higher linking capacity compared to crotonic acid. The maximum values were 7 pg and 5.5 well respectively. At added protein concentrations below 20 pg ml both acids showed a linking degree close to 100 t. Example 2Object The purpose of the following example was to quantify the protein binding capacity of an acrylic acid grafted PVC surface and to compare the capacity of the grafted surface with the ability of an ungrafted PVC surface to bind protein by passive adsorption.Performance The grafting process and the subsequent treatment were performed in accordance with Example 1. For the test a PVC microtiter plate grafted with acrylic acid in this way was used and as a comparison an untreated plate.Bovine serum albumin BSA, Cohn fr V.A. Johnsson Co. , 125 was labelled with Na I amounts and process according to Example 1 . To the acrylic acid grafted plate was added BSA and coupling reagent according to Example 1. Before the addition of protein to the untreated PVC plate, the protein was transferred into an adsorption promoting buffer. This buffer consisted of 0.1 M sodium carbonate of pH 9.6.The transfer was done by passage over a PD 10 column, equilibrated with said carbonate buffer. To the untreated plate this protein was then added in amounts equivalent with those which were added to the grafted plate. No coupling reagent EDAC was added to the untreated plate. The total added volume per well 100 rl was however the same. Incba tion, washings, treatment and radioactivity measurements were performed in accordance with Example 1.Result The quantification was made in accordance withExample 1. The maximum binding capacity of the acrylic acid grafted PVC plate was 6.5 pg well . The corresponding value for the untreated PVC plate having adsorption bound protein was 0.1 Fg well. Example 3Object In accordance with Examples 1 and 2 but comparing the coupling capacity of a crotonic acid grafted PVC surface and the adsorption capacity of a polystyrene PS surface.Performance Grafting and subsequent treatment were performed in accordance with Example 1. For the adsorption comparison loose polystyrene wells Removawell, Dynatech were used. BSA was labelled with Na125I in accordance with Examples 1 and 2. For the adsorption to PS the protein was transferred into carbonate buffer in accordance with Example 2. Additions, incubation, washings, treatment and radioactivity measurements were made in accordance with Examples 1 and 2.Result The quantification was made in accordance withExample 1. The maximum binding capacity of the crotonic acid grafted PVC plate was 5 fg well. For the untreatedPS wells having adsorption bonded protein the corresponding value was 0.1 pg well. Example 4Object Demonstration of the protein binding capacity of an acrylamide grafted polystyrene surface after glutaraldehyde activation.Performance Acrylamide AAM was grafted on polystyrene tubes Nunc Star Tubes according to the previously described grafting process. The grafted surfaces were activated overnight at 37 C with a 25 by volume aqueous glutaraldehyde solution at pH 7.6. After the activation the tubes were extensively washed with distilled water.Different amounts of a Na125I labelled rabbit immunoglobulin were added to the tubes in a total volume of 200 pl. The protein was dissolved in a 0.5 M phosphate buffer at pH 7.6.After incubation overnight on a tube shaker at a tempera ture of 4 0C the tubes were extensively washed with the washing buffer previously described. The tubes were then counted in a y counter and then washed again with a 10 solution by volume of the detergent Decon 90 CR in order to elucidate the character of the protein binding. The tubes were then again counted in a y counter.Result Glutaraldehyde activated AXM tubes could bind up to 6 ug of rabbit immunoglobulin tube. Of the added protein 90 95 could be shown to be covalently linked as it could not be removed by the Decon 90 z detergent. Example 5Object The purpose of the following test was to optimize the EDAC concentration related to available carboxylic groups on a PVC surface. The carbodiimide should be added stoechiometrically in an excess of 10 100 times. A comparison was made between the ability of acrylic acid and crotonic acid grafted PVC plates respectively to bind human gammaglobulin HGG of various concentrations employing EDAC.Performance The grafting process and the subsequent treatment were performed in accordance with Example 1. HGG was Na125 labelled with Na I, treated and added in accordance with Example 1. EDAC was added at a concentration of 10, 100 and 1000 pg ml.Incubation, washings, treatment and radioacitivity measurements were made in accordance with Example 1. Result The quantification was made in accordance with example 1. Acrylic acid In adding 50 1g HGG well at EDAC concentrations of 1000 and 100 pg ml respectively the higher concentration gave a 12.5 higher binding capacity. At a EDAC concentration of 10 ugXml quantitative additions lower than those described for passively adsorbing wells with BSA in accordance with examples 2 and 3 were obtained.Crotonic acid The binding capacity when adding 5 pg HGG well at a EDAC concentration of 1000 and 100 pg ml respectively was identical 1.1 ug and in turn half of the corresponding value obtained for the acrylic acid. The EDAC concentration of 10 ug ml gave a very low addition.Example 6Object Passive adsorption to a plastic surface can be increased by grafting of a suitable group. The interactions between for instance a protein in solution and such a plastic surface can then be increased both as regards hydrophobic, hydrophilic and charge interaction. The purpose of the following example was to show that a PVC plate grafted with crotonic acid could passively adsorb a larger amount of protein than a corresponding untreated PVC plate and untreated loose polystyrene PS wells respectively. Perform nce The grafting process and subsequent treatment were performed in accordance with example 1. Human gammaglobulin HGG was labelled with Na125I and treated as in example 1. HGe was in addition transferred into carbonate buffer in accordance with the description in example 2.To the crotonic acid grafted PVC plate was added 50 pl of the protein solution in concentrations according to example 1.Then 50 A1 3M phosphate buffer of pH 6.3 was added.To the untreated PVC plate and the untreated PS wells respectively were added equivalent amounts and volumes of the protein, transferred into carbonate buffer, and then another 50 iul carbonate buffer was added. Incubation, washings, treatment and radioactivity measurements were performed in accordance with example 1.Result The quantification was made in accordance with example 1.
