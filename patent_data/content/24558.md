# Selectively actuatable fluid control for a work implement.

## Abstract
A fluid control system for selectively holding a work implement, such as a blade in a motor grader or the like, in a fixed position in a first operating mode, and for selectively providing a shock absorbing system 70, 72 for the imple ment in a second operating mode. In the fixed position mode, lock valves 36,38,68 are operative to provide positive locking for an implement actuator 24,26 , while in the shock absorb ing mode, longstem lock valves 82,84 are operable to main tain one check valve 102 of a dual valve structure 96,98 unseated at all times. Each unseated check valve 102 pro vides a connection of one end of an implement actuator 24,26 to vent to insure that the shock absorbing system 70,72 maintains a full shock absorbing capacity.
