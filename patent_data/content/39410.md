# Concentrating alkali metal hydroxide.

## Abstract
A process for the simultaneous production of alkali metal hydroxide and electrical energy is accomplished with a plurality of hybrid cells 1 each comprising a gas diffusion anode for oxidation of hydrogen, a gas diffusion cathode for reduction of oxygen and a diffusion barrier selectively permeable to cations, the cells being operated in series as a cascade with an aqueous solution of alkali metal hydroxide introduced as anolyte into an anode com partment of a first hybrid cell 6 at one end of the series and an aqueous fluid medium receptive to alkali metal ions introduced as catholyte into a cathode compartment of a last hybrid cell 7 at the opposite end of the series of cells 1 . The anolyte is caused to flow through the anode com partments 3 of the cells 1 in sequence from the first cell 6 to the last cell 7 of the series of cells 1 . The catholyte is caused to flow through the cathode compart ments 4 in sequence from the last cell 7 to the first cell 6 countercurrently to the flow of anolyte from hybrid cell to hybrid cell of the series of cells 1 , but cocurrently with the flow of anolyte in each individual cell of the series. The anolyte may be the effluent cell liquor of a chloralkali electrolysis cell the hydrogen product of which may supply the anodes of the hybrid cells and the power requirements of which may be partly met by the electrical energy gene rated by the hybrid cells.
