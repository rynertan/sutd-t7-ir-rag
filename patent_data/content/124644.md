# Method and apparatus for removing oil from water.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for removing oil from water. The invention includes a separation vessel for separating the oil by gravity from the water. The generally oil free water from the separation vessel is pumped under pressure through an ultraflne molecular filter. The concentrate liquid from the ultrafine molecular filter is directed into a concentrator vessel which separates out the oil which remains in the concentrate liquid. The separated oil is directed back into the separation vessel and the remaining liquid is directed back through the ultrafine molecular filter. Ejection water is periodically directed into the separation vessel to discharge oil accumu lated in the separation vessel.
