# An oscillator and an EPROM including such an oscillator.

## Abstract
An oscillator circuit for controlling the charging of capactances in a bootstrap circuit included in an EPROM which is erasable by means of ultraviolet light is arranged to provide oscillating outputs having a duty ratio greater than 50 . The oscillator circuit includes a delay circuit having its output positively fed back to its input, the delay circuit com prising at least one inverter and at least one capacitive resis tive time constant circuit formed by at least one depletion type MOS transistor, the gate and the drain or source of the or each depletion type MOS transistor being connected together.
