# Method and apparatus for generating charged particles.

## Abstract
Generation of charged particles, e.g. ions, by extracting them from a high density source provided by an electrical gas breakdown in an electric field between two conducting electrodes separated by an insulator. When a high frequency electric field is applied, surprisingly high ion current densities can be obtained, providing numerous advantages over conventional ion forming techniques for use in electrostatic printing and office copying.
