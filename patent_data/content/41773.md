# Solar cell production.

## Abstract
The continuous production of solar cells by the glow discharge plasma deposition of layers of varying electrical characteristics is achieved by advancing a substrate through a succession of deposition chambers. Each of the chambers is dedicated to a specific material type deposition. The cham bers are mutually isolated to avoid the undesired admixture of reaction gases therebetween. Each plasma deposition is car ried out in its glow discharge area, chamber, or chambers, with isolation between the plasma regions dedicated to dif ferent material types. Masking, mechanical or lithographic, can be employed relative to the substrate to cause the deposi tion in the desired configuration. After the semiconductor deposition is complete, top contact and anti reflection layer or layers are deposited, followed by a protective lamination.
