# Measuring instrument having low charge detector.

## Abstract
A low charge detector, for a measuring instrument incorporating a meter for indicating measurement readings, includes a low battery detector circuit 4 which causes an output 6a to be released from a 1 Hz oscillator 6 , when a battery pack supplying power to the instrument discharges to a predetermined level. The output 6a is then applied to a pointer on the meter, thus causing the pointer to execute oscillations of a relatively small amplitude. When the battery pack is substantially dead, a dead battery detector circuit 10 causes an output 6b to be released from the oscillator 6 and to combine with output 6a . The combined output is then applied to the pointer, thus causing the pointer to execute oscillations of a substantially greater amplitude, thereby indicating that recharging of the battery pack is required.
