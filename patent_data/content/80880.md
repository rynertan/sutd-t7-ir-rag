# Process for preparing m alkylhydroxybenzene.

## Abstract
An improved process for preparing m alkylhydroxy benzene which comprises heating alkylbenzene or an isomeric mixture of alkylbenzenesulfonic acid in the pre sence of sulfuric acid and an inorganic salt at a temperature of from 150 to 210 C to form an isomeric mixture of alkylbenzenesulfonic acid which is rich in the m isomer, selectively hydrolyzing the isomers of alkylbenzenesulfonic acid other than the m isomer, and caustically fusing the unhydrolyzed alkylbenzenesulfonic acid.
