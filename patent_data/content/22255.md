# Electronic wristwatch comprising two different displays.

## Abstract
The small sized electronic timepiece comprises a casing 1 susceptible to turn entirely on itself in a support 3 in order to expose in a first position an analog display 2 and in a second position a digital display 8 . The support is constituted by a rectangular plate 15 two opposed edges of which have upwardly extending wing portions 6 , the wristband 4 or any other fastening system being fixed in the neighbourhood of said wing portions. The casing is adapted to slide parallel to said wing portions from one edge to the other of the plate and to effect its turning movement in at least a third extreme position, the latter autorising an easier replacement of energy source 18 .
