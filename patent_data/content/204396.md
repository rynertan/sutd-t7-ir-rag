# Gas mixtures and processes for deposition of amorphous semiconductors.

## Abstract
Precursor gaseous mixtures from which wide and narrow band gap semiconductor alloy material may be deposited by a glow discharge process, said material characterized by im proved photoconductivity and stability. There is also dis closed a method of fabricating a narrow band gap semicon ductor that avoids differential depletion of the components of the precursor gaseous mixture.
