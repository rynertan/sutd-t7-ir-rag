# TONE DETECTOR

## Abstract
A digital, time shared tone detector which provides precise detection of one or more tones of predetermined frequency and which involves relatively low cost components, comprising apparatus 10 for receiving the sign bit of a signal being monitored over a multiplicity of channels, sequence up date apparatus 12 operative to present an up dated sequence of sign bits for each of the multiplicity of channels, comparator apparatus 16 operative to compare the updated sequence with at least one pattern representative of at least one tone frequency, apparatus receiving the output of the comparator apparatus and being operative to indicate the percentage of occurrances wherein matching was indicated by the comparator 32 , and threshold apparatus 50 operative to receive the output of the indicating apparatus and to indicate whether the indicated percentage exceeds a predetermined threshold indicating predetermined frequency tone detection.
