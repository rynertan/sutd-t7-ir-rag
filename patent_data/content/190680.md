# METHOD AND CASTING PLANT FOR THE PRODUCTION OF METAL CASTINGS

## Abstract
Method and casting plant for the production of metal castings in which the molten metal is fed from a heated container 1 to a mould 3 or to a smaller container via a pressure pipe 4 , a pressure generating means 2 and a suction pipe 5 . According to the invention the temperature of the metal present in the pressure generating means 2 is controlled by a heat generating means 11 in order to maintain the metal at a temperature corresponding to or exceeding its melting point. The metal is present in molten state during its passage through the pressure generating means 2 and the pipe system. A protective medium is brought to surround at least the pressure generating means 2 to protect the same during operation and during a downtime period.
