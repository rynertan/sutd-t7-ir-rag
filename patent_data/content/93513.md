# Compensated amorphous silicon solar cell and method of fabrication thereof.

## Abstract
A hydrogenated amorphous silicon solar cell 10 has a photoactive intrinsic silicon layer 14b which is modified by the incorporation therein of N type and P type dopants so as to lower the bandgap energy of the layer to a level which is more closely aligned with the optimum bandgap energy for absorption of solar radiation 100 . The dopants are incorpo rated in amounts such as to reduce the bandgap energy of the intrinsic layer to less than 1.6 eV whilst ensuring that the recombination lifetime of the compensated intrinsic layer is greater than the transit time of the layer of the holes and electrons generated in the layer during illumination of the solar cell. The solar cell can advantageously be fabricated in a glow discharge apparatus.
