# Reinforced bead structure for heavy duty tyre.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a pneumatic radial ply tyre for heavy duty vehicle such as truck, bus, etc having an improved reinforcing structure for bead portion. The tyre comprises a carcass ply 2 of a radial or semi radial arrangement a metallic cord reinforcing layer 4 disposed at the axially outside of the turned up portion 2 of the carcass ply 2 an inside reinforcing layer 7 composed if fibre cords and disposed along the inside of the main portion of the carcass ply 2 , and the outside reinforcing layer 6 composed of fibre cords and arranged along the outside of the metallic cord reinforcing layer 4 and the turned up portion 2 . The above components satisfy the below equations 0.5h1 h2 0.9h1 , h2 h4 , 3.0h1 h3 1.3h1 , 3.0h1 h3 0.5h1 , and h3 h4 where h1 height of the outer end 2a of the turned up portion 2 h2 height of the outer end 4a of the metallic cord rein forcing layer 4 h3 height of the outer end 6b of the outside reinforcing layer 6 h3 height of the outer end 7a of the inside reinforcing layer 7 h4 height of the outer end 4b of the turned up portion 4 of the metallic reinforcing layer 4 .
