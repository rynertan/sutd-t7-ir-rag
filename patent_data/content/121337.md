# Method for purification of sulfuric acid solution.

## Abstract
A method for purification of a sulfuric acid solution such as, for example, a copper electrolyte which entrains at least one metal ion species selected from the group consisting of antimony ions, bismuth ions, and iorn ions and having a sulfuric acid concentration of at least 50 g liter is disclosed. The method comprises exposing the sulfuric acid solution to a chelating resin possessing aminomethylenephosphonic acid group as a chelate forming group thereby effecting adsorptive separation of the aforementioned at least one metal ion species from the solution. By the method described above, the antimony ions, bismuth ions, and or iron ions contained as impurities in the copper electrolyte can be easily and effi ciently separated out of the system without entailing any ecological problem.
