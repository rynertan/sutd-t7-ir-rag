# Process for the production of amorphous aluminosilicates and their use as catalysts.

## Abstract
Amorphous aluminosilicates useful as catalysts, par ticularly for the decomposition of methanol to synthesis gas, are produced by reacting a source of silica, a source of alumina, a source of alkali metal, water and one or more polyamines other than a diamine. A class of effective polyamines is that known as polyethylene polyamines of which triethylene tetramine is representative. The catalytic activity of the aluminosilicate may be enhanced in particu lar by incorporation of the metals copper, zinc, gallium, bismuth, chromium, thorium, iron, cobalt, ruthenium, rhodium, nickel, palladium, iridium or platinum.
