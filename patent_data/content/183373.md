# Track link assembly for track laying vehicle.

## Abstract
The outer end of a first link 10 is hinged to the inner end of a second link 11 by a pivot pin 12 working in a bushing 20 in the second link 11 . The outer end of the first link 10 has an annular recess 13 around the pin 12 accommodat ing a sealing ring 30 . The axially inner end of this ring is accommodated in an annular groove 21 in the end of the bushing 20 , so that the sealing ring oscillates with the bushing 20 and second link 11 . The axially outer end of the sealing ring has a first lip sealing against the bottom of the annular recess 13 , preferably acting against an interposed thrust washer 16 . The inner periphery of the sealing ring is provided with a second sealing lip 36 acting against the pivot pin 12 . The washer 16 and pivot pin surface may both be hardened. The sealing ring 30 is loaded by a more resilient, elastomeric load ring 31 accommodated in an annular recess of C shaped cross section, so as to urge the lips 34, 36 into good sealing contact and keep the sealing ring snugly in the annular groove 21 .
