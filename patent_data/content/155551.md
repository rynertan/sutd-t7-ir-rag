# Method for the partial hydrogenation of conjugated dienes.

## Abstract
A method for the partial hydrogenation of conjugated dienes, characterized in that a chain conjugated diene in which the conjugated two double bonds have different numbers of substituents, is hydrogenated at a temperature of not higher than 50 C in the presence of a catalyst composed essentially of 1 a cobalt compound, 2 an organophosphine compound and 3 an aluminum com pound, to obtain a partially hydrogenated product wherein as between said conjugated two double bonds, the one having a greater number of substituents is selectively hydrogenated.
