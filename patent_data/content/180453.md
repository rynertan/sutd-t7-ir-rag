# PUMP MONITOR FOR PHOTOACTIVATION PATIENT TREATMENT SYSTEM

## Abstract
A preferred patient blood treatment system for the pho toactivation of reagents in contact with a patient s blood em ploys an infusion pump for adding anti coagulation reagent to the blood during extracorporeal operations. The infusion pump is preferably driven by a stepper motor and monitored by a peri odic photo chopper employing a plurality of sensors. The spac ing of the sensors and the spacing of the photo choppers work in concert to detect rotation of the stepper motor and to dis criminate such from stutter or other characteristic nonrotation al faults associated with stepper motors.
