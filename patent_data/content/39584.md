# Serial impact printer.

## Abstract
A print element 24 for a serial impact printer having a character set 22 which permits the typing of text 16 as well as chemical symbols 20 and formulae 18 with a small num ber of character elements. Closed ring structures 20 may be formed with the character set which may be expanded to var ious sizes. A serial impact printing system using the aforemen tioned printing element 24 automatically subscripts small nu merals when the printing element is positioned, without further action on the part of the typist.
