## Abstract
Multi ply continuous stationery 10 comprising a plural ity of inner plies 24,26,38,40 between a pair of outer plies 12,14 , the outer plies 12,14 being joined by glue line 62 along a first longitudinal edge 16 and the inner plies 24,26,38,40 along a second longitudinal edge 28 , the second longitudinal edge 28 comprising a row of collating holes 42 , the stationery 10 being characterised by adja cent plies 12,14,24,25,38,40 in the stationery 10 being held together at the second longitudinal edge 28 by glue lines 34,48,50 adjacent glue lines 34,48,50 being on alternate sides of the row of collating holes 42 , thereby preventing the amalgamation of the glue lines 34,48,50 to preserve the longitudinal flexibility of the stationery 10 and to allow some transverse movement between the plies 12,14,24,26,38,40 . Tenting between the outer plies 12,14 is avoided by arranging that, at the second longitudinal edge 28 , the outer plies 12,14 are attached only to the outermost ones 38,40 on their respective side of the inner plies 24,26,38,40 and not to one another. Additional transverse movement and longitudinal flexibility is provided by arranging that the inner plies 24,26,38,40 are provided in adjacent pairs of central plies 24,26 stretching right to the second longitudinal edge 28 and intermediate plies 38,40 stopping short of the second longitudinal edge 28 , the pairs of central plies 24,26 being held together by glue lines 34 outboard of any glue lines 48,50 associated with the intermediate ply 38,40 pairs.

## Description
MULTI PLY CONTINUOUS STATIONERY HAVING OFFSET GLUE LINES The present invention relates to multi ply, self copying continuous stationery suitable for use in electrically controlled printers such as might be used in association with computer equipment or point of sale equipment. It particularly relates to that style of continuous stationery where a plurality of inner plies are held between a pair of outer plies. It is well known to employ continuous stationery in electrically controlled printers used in conjunction with computers, point of sale terminals and the like. The stationery consists in many sheets or plies and the information, written, printed or typed on the front sheet is copied by means of pressure sensitive coating or carbon paper in whole or in part onto each sheet in the stationery.The various sheets in each record are then divided one from another and distributed as required for record and administrative purposes. The continuous stationery is generally provided on both sides with a row of sprocket holes for the alignment, guidance and driven movement of the stationery through a printer or typewriter.The sprocket holes are generally detachable from the stationery by means of longitudinal perforated lines. In the past continuous stationery has been employed where a plurality of inner plies are held between a pair of outer plies. The inner plies do not extend as far as the longitudinal edges of the stationery. The two outer plies are joined at each of the longitudinal edges of the stationery and the inner plies are joined together and to the outer plies inboard of one of the longitudinal edges. The outer two plies therefore form a kind of envelope around the inner plies. Because the two outer plies are attached one to the other on either side of the continuous stationery there is a risk of tenting and buckling therebetween transversely across the continuous stationery. The fact of the outer two plies yet further being connected at a common point to the plurality of inner plies exacerbates the problem. In the past the outer two plies were joined one to another proximately to the longitudinal edges of the continuous stationery by a single glue line. Moreover, the outer two plies were joined to the plurality of inner plies by similar longitudinal glue lines and the inner plies were joined one to another in the same manner.The plurality of longitudinal glue lines used for this purpose laid one upon another throughout the thickness of the continuous stationery.Effectively the glue lines became a single column of glue with paper embedded at different points therein. The glue, thus reinforced, became a solid, rigid mass which impaired the longitudinal flexibility of the continuous stationery and further prevented any transverse movement between the plies thereby causing a risk of transverse buckling and tenting. It is therefore desirable to provide multi ply continuous stationery free of impairment to longitudinal flexibility as a result of amalgamated glue lines and wherein a degree of transverse movement is possible between the plies for the prevention of tran6verse tenting and buckling. The present invention consists in multi ply continuous stationery having first and second longitudinal edges and front and rear outer plies joined proximately to said first longitudinal edge by a longitudinal, first edge glue line, said stationery including a plurality of inner plies intermediate between said front and rear outer plies, a longitudinal row of collating holes proximate to said second longitudinal edge and a plurality of longitudinal second edge glue lines, one in each interstice between each adjacent pair of plies in said stationery, said stationery being characterised by the second edge glue lines in adjacent pairs of interstices in said stationery are alternately outboard of and inboard of said row of collating holes such that no second edge glue line over lies another second edge glue line in an adjacent interstice such that no pair of second edge glue lines in adjacent interstices in said stationery can amalgamate to impair the longitudinal flexibility of said stationery, and such that the transverse displacement between adjacent pairs of said second edge glue lines in said stationery is permissive of a predetermined range of transverse movement between adjacent pairs of plies in said stationery. ln a first preferred embodiment of the present invention multi ply continuous stationery comprises a front outer ply, a rear outer ply, an adjacent pair of central plies, an intermediate ply between the central plies and the front outer ply and a further intermediate ply between the central plies and the rear outer ply. In the preferred embodiment, the front and rear outer plies extend to a first longitudinal edge of the stationery where they are joined by a first edge longitudinal glue line. The inner plies, consisting in the central plies and the intermediate plies, preferably stop short of the first longitudinal edge. The front and rear outer plies preferably comprise a longitudinal row of sprocket holes through penetrative of both thereof at the first longitudinal edge, in which case, the first edge glue line is preferably outboard of the row of sprocket holes. The front and rear outer plies further comprise a longitudinal perforation line inboard of the row of sprocket holes at the first longitudinal edge whereby the edge strip containing the row of sprocket holes can be removed. In the preferred embodiment the central plies are extensive right to the second longitudinal edge of the stationery. The intermediate plies stop short of the second longitudinal edge.Second edge longitudinal glue lines are disposed between the plies proximately to the second longitudinal edge. A row of collating holes is preferably provided proximately to, but spaced away from, the second longitudinal edge. The second edge glue lines holding together adjacent plies are disposed on alternate sides of the row of collating holes such that no second edge glue line overlies an adjacent second edge glue line, thereby preventing amalgamation of the second edge glue lines. The second edge glue line intermediate between the pair of central plies is preferably outboard of all of the second edge glue lines associated with any of the intermediate plies. The central plies preferably comprise a longitudinal row of sprocket holes at the second longitudinal edge of the stationery in which case the second edge glue line between the pair of central plies is preferably inboard of the row of sprocket holes at the second longitudinal edge of the stationery. A second longitudinal perforation line is preferably provided, through penetratively of the central plies, inboard of that second edge glue line holding the pair of central plies together. A third longitudinal perforation line is preferably provided through penetratively of all of the plies in the stationery spaced from, but proximate to, the second longitudinal edge of the stationery and inboard of all second edge glue lines whereby the row of collating holes and the row of sprocket holes at the second longitudinal edge may be detached. The front outer ply is preferably affixed by means of a second edge longitudinal glue line only to the intermediate ply adjacent thereto. Similarly the rear outer ply is preferably affixed by means of a second edge glue line only to that other intermediate ply adjacent thereto. This attachment of the front and rear outer plies only to the adjacent inner ply has the effect of preventing transverse buckling and tenting between the front and rear outer plies. The continuous stationery of the third embodiment is preferably assembled on a collating machine where preprinted, prepunched and preperforated plies are brought together on a collating band for the deposition thereon of water soluable glue lines which are rapidly dried in a radio frequency dryer. Because of the mirror image construction of the continuous stationery about the centre line between the central plies, the continuous stationery can be made up from pairs of identical rolls of preprinted and prepunched stationery. ln a second preferred embodiment everything is as in the first preferred embodiment save that the number of inner plies has been increased to fourteen. Pairs of intermediate plies are spaced between pairs of central plies, this construction ensuring that alternate second edge glue lines are on alternate sides of the row of collating holes whilst always maintaining that the second edge glue lines intermediate between the pairs of central plies are outboard of any of the second edge glue lines on any of the intermediate plies. The invention is further described, by way of an example, in the following description read in conjunction with the appended drawings, in which Figure 1 shows an inclined, part cutaway view of the continuous stationery of the first preferred embodiment Figure 2 shows a transverse cross sectional view with exaggerated vertical dimensions of the continuous stationery otherwise shown in Figure 1 Figure 3 shows, in schematic outline, the manner of assembling the continuous stationery of Figures 1 and 2 Figure 4 shows a cross sectional view with exaggerated vertical dimensions of the second preferred embodiment of the continuous stationery wherein a very large number of plies can be accommodated. Figure 1 shows an inclined projection in part cutaway of the continuous stationery of the first preferred embodiment. Continuous multi ply stationery 10 comprises a front outer ply 12 and a rear outer ply 14. The front and rear outer plies 12, 14 are extensive to a first longitudinal edge 16 of the stationery 10.The front and rear outer plies 12, 14 are longitudinally joined proximately to the first longitudinal edge 16. A first row of sprocket holes 18 is provided through penetratively of both the front and rear outer plies 12, 14 along the line of, and slightly inboard of, the first longitudinal edge 16. A first perforation line 20 is provided in both the front and rear outer plies 12, 14 parallel to the first longitudinal edge 16 and inboard of the first row of sprocket holes 18 whereby, by tearing of the first perforation line 20, a first edge strip 22 bearing the first line of sprocket holes 18 can be detached. A first central ply 24 and a second central ply 26 are provided adjacent to one another in the centre of the stationery 10.The first and second central plies 24, 26 extend to a second longitudinal edge 28 of the stationery 10. A second row of sprocket holes 30 is provided through penetratively of both the first and second central plies 24, 26 parallel to, and proximate to, the second longitudinal edge 28 of the stationery 10. A second longitudinal perforation line 32 through penetrative of both the first and second central plies 24, 26 and parallel to the second longitudinal edge 28 is provided inboard of the second row of sprocket holes 30. The first and second central plies 24, 26 are joined one to another by a first second edge glue line 34. Intermediate between the second row of sprocket holes 30 and the second longitudinal perforation line 32.By tearing the second longitudinal perforation line 32, a second edge strip 36 is detached removing the second row of sprocket holes 30 and separating the first and second central plies 24, 26 one from the other. A first intermediate ply 38 is provided between the front outer ply 12 and the first central ply 24. A second intermediate ply 40 is provided between the rear outer ply 14 and the second central ply 26 The first and second central plies 24, 26 and the first and second intermediate plies 38, 40 extend, at the first longitudinal edge 16, only as far as the first longitudinal perforation line 20. The intermediate plies 38, 40 and the central plies 24, 26, together being the inner plies of the stationery 10, are not attached one to any other nor attached to either the front or rear outer plies 12, 14 at the first longitudinal perforation line 20. Thus, with the tearing of the first longitudinal perforation line 20, all of the plies 12, 14, 24, 26, 38, 40 of the stationery 10 are separated one from another. Proximately to the second longitudinal edge 28 the intermediate plies 38, 40 and the front and rear outer plies 12, 14 are extensive only as far as the second longitudinal perforation line 32. A row of collating holes 42 is provided proximate to the second longitudinal edge 28, inboard of the second longitudinal perforation line 32 and through penetrative of all of the plies 12, 14, 22, 26, 38, 40 of the stationery 10 for use in assembly of the stationery in a manner to be later described. A third longitudinal perforation line 44 is provided through penetratively of all of the plies 12, 14, 24, 26, 38, 40 of the stationery 10 inboard of the row of collating holes 42. Tearing of the third longitudinal perforation line 44 allows the detachment of a third edge strip 46 bearing the row of collating holes 42. The first intermediate ply 38 is attached to the first central ply 24 by means of a second second edge glue line 48 intermediate between the row of collating holes 42 and the third perforation line 44. The second intermediate ply 40 is affixed to the second central ply 26 by a second second edge glue line 48 in the same manner which is not shown in Figure 1. The first intermediate ply 38 is longitudinally affixed to the front outer ply 12 by means of a third second edge glue line 50 outboard of the row of collating holes 42, but inboard of the second longitudinal perforation line 32. In a similar manner, although not shown in Figure 1, the second intermediate ply 40 is longitudinally attached to the rear outer ply 14 by a third seaond edge glue line 50. The second and third second edge glue lines 48,50 being within the third edge strip 46, when the third longitudinal perforation line 44 is torn, all of the plies 12, 14, 24, 26, 38, 40 are perforated one from another. Transverse perforation and fold lines 52 are provided at regularly spaced intervals along the stationery 10 to define between adjacent pairs thereof a transaction record 54. The transverse perforation and fold lines 52 are through penetrative of all plies 12, 14, 24, 26, 38, 40 encountered and allow for the separation of one transaction record 54 from another by tearing, and further allow for the fanfolding of the stationery 10 there along. Figure 2 shows a cross sectional view with exaggerated vertical scale of the stationery 10 of Figure 1 viewed along one of the transverse perforation and fold lines 52 from the left hand side of Figure 1. A first pair of arrows 56 indicates the position of the first perforation line 20. A second pair of arrows 58 indicates the position of the second perforation line 32. A third pair of arrows 60 indicates the position of the third perforation line 44. Otherwise than as indicated, all features are the same as shown on Figure 1 save that the second intermediate ply 40 and the rear outer ply 14 are both fully visible. A first longitudinal edge glue line 62 is provided intermediately between the front and rear outer plies 12, 14 outboard of the first line of sprocket holes 18 for holding the front and rear outer plies 12, 14 together.The description of Figure 1 equally applies to Figure 2. With particular reference to Figure 2, it is to be noted that adjacent ones of the second edge glue lines 34, 48, 50 lie on alternate sides of the row of collating holes 42. Thus no second edge glue line 34, 48, 50 overlies another glue line in the next adjacent pair of plies.Thus the second edge glue lines 34, 48, 50 are prevented from amalgamating one with the other. The longitudinal flexibility of the stationery 10 is thereby assured. It is further to be noted that the first second edge glue line 34 lies outboard of any of the second second edge glue lines 48 and the third second edge glue lines 50. Thus, the second edge glue lines 34, 48, 50 are divided into three groups making for even greater flexibility than is allowed by two. Furthermore, the greater distance afforded between the first second edge glue line 34 and the second second edge glue line 48 means that there is even less likelihood of the first and second second edge glue lines 34, 48 amalgamating. The second edge glue lines 34, 48, 50 allow for an unglued portion of each ply 12, 14, 24, 26, 38, 40 to lie therebetween.This allows a measure of transverse movement between the plies since the portion therebetween is capable of bending. Thus, a small range of transverse movements between the plies 12, 14, 24, 26, 38, 40 is made possible to avoid transverse buckling and tenting between the plies. In particular, the front outer ply 12 is attached to the first intermediate ply 38 by a third second edge glue line 50 and the rear outer ply 14 is attached to the second intermediate ply 40 again by a third second edge glue line 50. The front and rear outer plies 12, 14, not being attached to one another, cannot buckle or tent relative to one another and are allowed a small measure of movement relative to the inner ply by means of the bending of the spare material respectively in the first and second intermediate plies 38, 40 between the second and third second edge glue lines 48, 50. When it is desired to utilize the stationery 10, the transaction record 54 is first separated from the stationery by tearing along the transverse perforation line 52, the first edge strip 22 is removed and then the third perforation line 44 is torn allowing all of the plies 12, 14, 24, 26, 38, 40 to be separated and distributed as required. As an alternative, after the removal of the first edge strip 22, the second edge strip 36 can be removed.The inner plies 24, 26, 38, 40 then split into two groups which can be separately treated. Figure 3 shows the manner in which the stationery 10 is assembled. A collating band 63 is driven by, and passes over, rollers 64. The collating band 63 carries a row of collating pins 65 for passing through the collating holes 42 in each ply of the stationery 10. A first preprinted and prepunched roll 66 dispenses the rear outer ply 14 onto the band. Thereafter, a second preprinted and prepunched roll 68 dispenses the second intermediate ply 40 onto the band 63. A third preprinted and prepunched roll next dispenses the second central ply 26 onto the band 63. A fourth preprinted and prepunched roll 72 dispenses the first central ply 24 onto the band 63. A fifth preprinted and prepunched roll 74 dispenses the first intermediate ply 38 onto the band 63. Finally a sixth preprinte and prepunched roll 76 dispenses the front outer ply 12 onto the band.The various plies 14, 40, 26, 24, 38, 12 are thereby dispenses onto the band 63 and on top of one another in the correct order. A first glue dispenser 78 dispenses both the first edge glue line 62 on the first edge of the rear outer ply and a third second edge glue line 50 on the second edge 28 of the stationery 10.A second glue dispenser 80 dispenses a second outer ply glue line 48 onto the second intermediate ply 40. A third glue dispenser 82 dispenses the first second edge glue line 34 onto the second central ply 26. A fourth glue dispenser 84 dispenses a second second edge glue line onto the first central ply 24. A fifth and last glue dispenser 86 dispenses a third second edge glue line 50 onto the first intermediate ply 28. Thus brought together and glued, the plies 12, 14, 24, 26, 38, 40 are passed together through a radiofrequency drier 88. The dispensed glue is preferably, though not necessarily, of a water soluable type, and the radio frequency drier rapidly dries the glue to hold the stationery 10 together. The glue having been dried, the stationery is passed to a fanfold stacker 90 where it is folded and stacked prior to packing and shipping. Those skilled in the art will be aware of ways in which hotmelt glue and glues using solvents other than water can be used to create the glue lines 62, 34, 48, 50. Figure 4 shows a cross sectional view similar to that ofFigure 2 of the second preferred embodiment of the present invention. All similarly numbered elements correspond to the same elements as are shown and described in relation to Figure 2. Whereas inFigure 2 there is shown only one pair of central plies 24, 26, Figure 4 shows a plurality of three sets of central plies 24, 26. Each pair of central plies 24, 26 is divided from the other pairs of central plies 24, 26 by an intervening pair of intermediate plies 38, 40. The intermediate ply 38, 40 adjacent to a central ply 24, 26 is affixed thereto by a second second edge glue line. Each pair of intermediate plies 38,40 is affixed one to the other by means of a third second edge glue line 50. Each pair of central plies 24, 26 is affixed one to the other by a first second edge glue line 34.By maintaining this pattern continuous stationery may be built of any thickness where the glue lines 34, 48, 50 along the second edge are staggered one from the other and no second edge glue line 34, 48, 50 overlies another adjacent thereto. The front outer ply 12 and the rear outer ply 14 in Figure 4 are shown affixed to the outer member of a pair of intermediate plies 38, 40. There is no necessity for the outermost intermediate plies to be paired.Thus, whereas in Figure 4 the front and rear outer plies 12, 14 are shown affixed to the outermost intermediate plies 40, 38 by means of a second edge glue line 48, if the pairing on the outermost intermediate plies 38, 40 is abandoned, then the front and rear outer plies will be affixed to the residual outermost intermediate ply 38, 40 by means of a third second edge glue line 50 Those skilled in the art will be aware that the intermediate plies 38, 40 can extend a little beyond the second perforation line 32. Because of the symmetry of the stationery 10, the first and sixth rolls 66, 76 can dispense the identical printed and punched ply, as can the second and fifth rolls 68, 74, and the third and fourth rolls 70, 72. Those skilled in the art will be aware of obvious extensions to the apparatus of Figure 3 whereby the stationery shown in Figure 4 can be made. The discussion on symmetr of the form equally applies to the stationery shown in Figure 4. The invention further consists in any of all of the features hereinbefore described taken singly or in combination.
