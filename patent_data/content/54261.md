# Polymer polyisocyanate compositions, processes for making same and processes for making polyurethane products therefrom.

## Abstract
Novel polymer polyisocyanate compositions made by polymerizing at least one ethylenically unsaturated monom er in situ in a blend of a first organic polyisocyanate and a stabilizer. The stabilzier comprises a polyoxyalkylene polyol having a number average molecular weight of at leat 4000 an isocyanato terminated propolymer formed by reacting the polyoxyalkylene polyol and a second organic polyisocyanate with the proviso that the isocyanato terminated prepolymer and the first organic polyisocyanate provide greater than 25 equivalents of isocyanato groups per equivalent of hydroxyl groups a polymer polyol formed using the polyoxyalkylene polyol a polymer prepolymer formed using the polyoxyal kylene polyol with the proviso indicated for the prepolymer above or a modified polyol containing an ester group formed using the polyoxyalkylene polyol. The novel com positions provide highly stable dispersions of polymer particles in the first organic polyisocyanate and are highly useful in the production of polyurethane products.
