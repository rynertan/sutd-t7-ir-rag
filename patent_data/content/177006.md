## Description
A system for air humidifying The present invention relates to a system for air humidifying by means of humidifier nozzles1 especially in industrial halls and the like. Humidifying nozzles can be operated by means of pressurized air or water. A serious disadvantage of such nozzles is that they easily attract dirt from the surrounding air, which, in turn, results in so called dropping. Such water drops may be greatly disturbing in e.g. paper production processes, for which reason the nozzles cannot be positioned above the process. Besides, solid and dissolved substances contained in the water get into the air, and a precise control is usually difficult. There are also indirect humidifying systems in use, wherein water is evaporated from e.g. a cell. Such cells gather dust and form a culture medium for bacteria, algae and mould. Plenty of maintaining is required to obtain satisfactory operation. The humidifying effectiveness is dependent on the amount of air, and the humidity ratio is limited. The object is to provide a new air humidifying system of the type mentioned in the beginning, which system eliminates or reduces at least some of the previous disadvantages. The system according to the invention is mainly characterized in that an air jet is directed into the range of action of at least one humidifier nozzle in order to increase the amount of air for binding or capturing moisture and in order to convey the moisture in a desired direction. The air jet is preferably effected by means of at least one so called impulse air nozzle, and such air nozzles are positioned in sequence so that a subsequent air nozzle is positioned within the jet range of a pre ceding air nozzle. The air nozzles are capable of conveying slowly incoming conditioning air and surrounding air over a long distance to the desired object, and of carrying humidity therewith. In this way, the range of action of the humidifier nozzles can be notably lengthened in the direction of movement of the air, and, at the same time, it is possible to narrow the diffusion of the water spray both in height and in width. It is also possible to use nozzles having a large capacity and they can be concentrated within a considerably smaller area than previously and, what is important, in such a manner that there are not any longer any humidifier nozzles positioned immediately above sensitive process stages or machines. As the water spray is better held together, it is also possible to reduce the free height required above the process machines for giving the spray drops enough time to evaporate so that they do not fall on sensitive surfaces.In addition, the humidifying process is much easier to control, because the humidifying is not dependent on the amount of incoming air. In the system according to the invention, the air is cooled by means of an evaporative cooling, whereby the amount of removed heat is dependent on the amount of air and on the temperature difference between the incoming and the outgoing air, and, further, on the amount of evaporated water. The temperature of the space to be air conditioned as well as the relative humidity can be controlled by suitably adjusting the state and flow rate of the incoming air as well as the water flow. The invention will be described in the following with reference to the attached drawing, which schematically shows a section of a space to be air conditioned, which space is provided with an air humidifying system according to one exemplary embxnxnt of the invention. The reference numeral 1 of the drawing designates a space to be air conditioned and the air of which is simultaneously humidified. The humidifying is effected by means of humidifier nozzles 2 and 3, of which the nozzle 2 can be an ejector operated by pressurized air and provided with pressure air ducts 2a and water ducts 2b, and the nozzle 3 can be operated by water pressure.The action or jet range of the humidifier nozzles is designated by the reference numeral 4. In the humidifying system according to the invention, an air jet is directed into the range of action of the humidifier nozzle, which air jet is, in the preferred embodiment of the drawing, effected by means of an impulse air nozzle 5. There are preferably several such air nozzles 5 provided in sequence in such a manner that a subsequent air nozzle is positioned within the jet range 6 of a preceding nozzle. The impulse jets 6 make it possible to convey humid air over a long distance to the desired objects. The humidifier nozzle is preferably positioned inside the impulse air nozzle 5, as is illustrated in the case of the nozzle 2. However, it is also possible to position the humidifier nozzle in front of the air nozzle 5, as in the case of the humidifier nozzle 3, or above the air nozzle. The block 7 designates a device for incoming air, which, however, is not always necessary. The drawing is only intended to illustrate the main idea of the invention. The humidifier nozzles need not be provided for each air nozzle, or some of the humidifier nozzles can be positioned separately without a controlling air jet. The air nozzles 5 with the humidifier nozzles thereof can be fitted in several rows and they can form conveying paths bending and or branching in the horizontal and vertical directions as required in each particular case.
