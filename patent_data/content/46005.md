# PREPARATION OF IMPROVED PHENYLALKYLSULFONATES

## Abstract
An improved process for production of alkylphenylsul fonate compounds whereby the proportion of the 2 alkylphenylsulfonate isomer is reduced relative to the higher numbered isomers thereof 3 alkyl 4 alkyl etc. . After alkylation of aromatic compounds to produce a mixture of alkylbenzenes, the 2 alkylbenzene isomer is selectively crack ed to lower boiling products, leaving the higher numbered isomers substantially unreacted. Subsequent sulfonation results in alkylphenylsulfonate derivatives having improved detergency properties.
