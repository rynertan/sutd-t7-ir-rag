# Paste spreader apparatus for shredded wheat.

## Abstract
Edible paste enters an apparatus at an inlet. A nut holds the inlet coupled to another supply pipe. A portion of the nut is threaded. The area of the inlet is approximately equal to the area of a slit like opening, the filling material or edible paste passing through the slit and into an opening in a block. A second block has a plurality of valves therein, the valves being simple plug valves, and having a single bore there through. Paste is extruded through nozzles fixedly con nected to a third block, and paste is extruded into rows upon a moving bed of a lower half portion of a continuous sheet of ,,shredded wheat in its uncut form. The paste is laid in rows of five across, and a second sheet of uncut shredded wheat is laid atop the first layer, trapping the rows of paste. The resulting product when cut forms the familiar shredded wheat biscuit shape. The finished product contains raisin paste.
