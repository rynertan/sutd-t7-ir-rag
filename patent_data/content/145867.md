## Description
ULTRA LOW FIN HEAT EXCHANGER WITH ENHANCED HEAT TRANSFER TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention is directed to an apparatus and process for the enhancement of heat transfer in a heat exchanger. More specifically, the present invention is directed to the use of ultra low fins on conduits inside the shell of the heat exchanger which fins enhance heat transfer when utilized in the presence of a two phase refrigerant. The present invention has application for various heat exchange uses, but is particularly amenable to use in the co11 wound heat exchangers of base load natural gas liquefaction plants. BACKGROUND OF THE PRIOR ART Enhanced heat exchange has been a goal sought for many industrial processes. Heat transfer enhancement 5s particularly attractive in the field of liquefaction of natural gas. Natural gas is a low value fuel resource produced as a by product from most oil field production operations. The liquefaction of natural gas is necessary for transport from distant productlon sites to regions having demand for such fuel. Liquefaction is an expensive energy intensive process.In order to keep the costs of liquefaction for a unit of natural gas low, natural gas recovery and liquefaction are performed only where relatively high production rates of natural gas are available. As a result, base load liquefaction plants tend to be very large and the attendant co11 wound heat exchangers in such plants have become larger, only constrained to the slze limitations for transport from the manufacture site to the site of use. In this type of heat exchange utility as well as other heat exchange utilities, a refrigerant in the liquid phase which comprises either a pure compound or a mixture of compounds is vaporized inside a heat exchanger containment or shell and outside a series of conduits through which the material natural gas to be reduced in temperature is passed.The temperature differential between the conduit wall and the refrigerant is usually too small to support nucleate boiling, but refrigerant vapor is produced at the 11quld vapor interface of the liquid fllm forming and flowing over the conduits inside the shell of the heat exchanger. Thins heat transfer process is called convective vaporization. Various persons skilled in the art have attempted to enhance heat exchange between a fluld passing internally through a conduit and a fluid passing over the external surface of such a conduit. In U.S. Patent 3,217,799 a method for enhancing the condensation of steam on the outside surface of a conduit is disclosed wherein a ribbed configuration as shown in F16 4 is set forth. The patent is directed to a steamlwater system for condensation rather than convective vaporization. In U.S. Patent 3,384,154, a heat exchange system is set forth wherein condensation occurs on an outer finned surface of a heat exchange condult as shown in FI6 6. A nucleate boiling surface having a porous structure is formed on the inside surface of the conduit. A discussion of the effects of surface tension on a liquid film is set forth at column 10, line 46 61 and illustrated in FIG 5. The discussion is limited to condensation and not convective vaporization. In U.S. Patent 3,455,376, a heat exchange surface is disclosed having ribbed surfaces wherein evaporation occurs along the surface with subsequent condensation of the vapor when it contacts a liquid phase existing outwardly from the ribbed surface. This patent is not directly concerned with a conduit having a fluid to be reduced in temperature passing therein. U.S. Patent 3,587,730 discloses a heat exchanger having porous layers bonded to the walls of the heat exchanger at the surfaces wherein the porous layer comprises conductive particles bonded together to form pores of capillary size on the heat exchange surface. The claims are directed to a plate fin type heat exchanger structure having a corrugated surface geometry. In U.S. Patent 3,779,312, a heat exchange conduit ts set forth having a specific undulating geometry on the inside surface of the conduit. The system is designed for steam condensation wherein a single phase fluid is carried inside the tube. The teaching of this patent is distinct from a two phase system passing over the exterior of a heat exchange condult. U.S. Patent 4,118,944 discloses the use of integral internal fins in the heat exchange tube wherein a refrigerant is vaporized inside the tube against the finned surface thereof. No dimension configuration is set forth for this particular structure. In U.S. Patent 4,211,276, a fin tube type heat exchanger is set forth wherein the roughening of the fin surface is desired in order to enhance the drainage of condensate formed on the fins during heat exchange. Again, this patent is directed to condensation and not convective vaporization. Fin dimension or geometry is not set forth beyond the recitation of the surface roughening requirement of the patent. U.S. Patent 4,216,819 discloses the use of a single layer of randomly distributed metal bodles bonded to a substrate to provide an increased heat exchange surface for condensation. Surface tension characteristics are set forth as an active phenomenon effecting the enhancement of condensation using the recited surfaces. In U.S. Patent 4,232,728, a structure for enhancing slngle phase or icondensSng heat transfer coefficients on the inside of tubing by bonding a layer of randomly distributed metal bodies to the inner wall is set forth.Criteria are given for the relative height of the bodies in relation to the tube inside dlameter and for the ovoid fraction of the bonded layer. This patent does not address the problem of connective vaporization in a two phase system. In Reissue Patent 30077, a heat transfer surface for enhancing nucleate boiling is set forth wherein the surface is grooved at a microscopic density and the grooves are subsequently deformed to form restricted openings therein. The restricted openings are the key to the effectiveness of the wheat transfer surface. The teaching of this geometry for use in nucleate boiling is dissimilar from the present invention s interest in convective vaporization. Various literature articles have been directed to an understanding of the physical dynamic parameters of liquid on a fluted or finned surface.Exemplary of such a disclosure is the article, Analysts of Nusselt TypeCondensation on a Vertical Fluted Surface, C. B. Panchal and K. J. Bell,NUMERICAL HEAT TRANSFER, volume 3, pages 357 371, 1980. Such studies again are directed to condensation and not connective vaporization. The present invention overcomes the limitation of the prior art heat exchange technology by providing for an ultra low fin geometry which is controlled by various geometric dimensions, as well as physical properties of the refrigerant belng utilized in the heat exchange. The utilization of these dimensions and propertles in a unique relationship provide for a fin geometry having unexpectedly high heat transfer enhancement. The use of such heat transfer enhancement allows for the reduction in size of heat exchangers or the maintenance of heat exchanger size with increased heat exchange capacity.Such a result is beneficial to heat exchange in general, but is particularly beneficial to the specific application of base load natural gas liquefaction wherein heat exchangers are presently at a near maximum in size and yet economics would dictate that even larger heat exchangers may be desirable. The present invention would provlde the increased heat exchange capacity for a relatively smaller heat exchanger size. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention ts directed to a heat exchanger having at least one tubular conduit for conducting a fluid from which heat is to be removed through such a heat exchanger wherein a shell surrounding such conduit defines a refrigerant space between sald shell and said conduit. The conduit is aligned such that a two phase refrigerant can pass over the conduit.The conduit includes ultra low fins affixed outward from the outer surface of sald conduit wherein the fin height H , the fin crest width w and the fin gap width W are selected in relationship to the density and surface tension of the refrigerant such that 1 p c 1 1 The present invention is particularly directed to a heat exchanger having a plurality of co11 wound tubular conduits such that a two phase refrigerant can pass substantially perpendicular to the axles of said conduits wherein the ultra low fins are affixed radially transverse or helically outward from the outer surface of the conduits.Such a heat exchanger is particularly appropriate for the refrigeration and liquefaction of natural gas as the gas passes through the interior of the finned conduits. The invention is also concerned with a process for heat exchanging a fluid in a heat exchanger which has at least one tubular conduit for such a fluid and a shell surrounding said conduit which defines a space for a two phase refrigerant. The refrigerant passes over the outside surface of the conduit to remove heat from the fluid passing through the condult.An enhanced level of heat transfer is achieved during the process of heat exchanging by passing the refrigerant over ultra low fins affixed to the conduit outer surface wherein the fin height H , the fin crest width w and the fin gap width W are selected in relationship to the density and surface tension of the refrigerant such that 2 gc 1 1 1 200 1 w w The process is more specifically directed to a method wherein the refrigerant passes over the outside surface of said condults in a direction generally perpendicular to the axles of said conduits and in which the refrigerant passes over ultra low fins which are radially transverse or helically affixed to the outer surface of said condults. The invention is more specifically directed to a process for the liquefaction of natural gas in a method as described above.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The invention is an tmproved means to chill or condense fluids flowing inside the tubes of a heat exchanger, the improvement comprising ultra low fins affixed more or less radially outwards from the outer surface of the tubes. The heat removed from said fluids is transferred to a liquid refrigerant flowing across and vaporizing on the ultra low finned tubes. The extent of enhancement to the shellstde heat transfer is remarkable and unexpected, exceeding even the maximum enhancement expected based on the increase in shellside heat transfer area.Because the flans are very small, the improved heat transfer is attained with little or no increase in the shellstde pressure drop per unit length along the axis of the shell. The ultra low fin tubing is distinguished from tubing which has been suggested tn the prior art as being effective for vaporizing liquids by its very low fin height and relatively high fin density number of fins per unit length The relatively small dimensions of the fins cause surface tension forces to become very large in relation to viscous and gravitational forces within the liquid films on the wetted finned tubing. The surface tension forces ensure that extremely thin liquid films are maintained on the sides of the fins, especially near the fin crests, resulting in very high local heat transfer coefficients in this region. The most effective fins are disposed approximately radially transverse on the tubing and can be integrally formed from the tubing base metal or be attached by other methods such as soldering, welding or tension winding. Fins tested and found effective to various extents had trapezoidal, rectangular, or essentially trlangular cross sections. Other related fin shapes are expected to be similarly effective. The fins may have flats at ether the fin crests or between the fins at the fin root diameter, said flats being more or less parallel with the axis of the tubing. The fin crests and valley bottoms between fins night also be rounded rather than flat. The fins can be made using any of a number of techniques which have been developed and which are available in the art for making conventional finned tubing. Usually, for convenience, such fins are helically disposed around the tube and can consist of one or more separate helical elements.The fin dimensions found to be important in the practice of the present invention are the fin height H , the effective width of the fin crests w and the width of the gap between adjacent fin crests W . As will be shown below, practice of the present invention requires that the physical properties of the refrigerant be taken into account in assigning numerical values to these fin parameters. For approximately radially transverse disposed fins, a remarkable and unexpected enhancement to the sheilside heat transfer is found for downflow vaporization two phase flow conditions. The enhancement can be several times larger than that which might be expected on the basis of the increase in surface area alone. Under the same conditions, longitudinally disposed fins were found to be less effective than radially transverse disposed fins, but were nevertheless still considerably more effective than the prior art bare tubing. To ensure uniform shellside two phase flow distribution, the axis of a co11 wound heat exchanger must be vertical. The tubes are helically wound in layers from one end of the exchanger to the other.The angle of winding is small, such that the tubes can be considered to be essentially horizontal. The poorer performance of longitudinally finned tubes is probably caused by their poor characteristics for feed and drainage of liquid films when the tubes are at or close to horizontal. The longitudinal flans might tend to cause flooding in the valleys between flans on the upper part of the tubes, leading to less effective heat transfer there, and, at the same time, hinder the feed of liquid to the lower part of the tubes, leading to poorer heat transfer there as well. Radlally transverse or helically disposed fins facilitate drainage of excess liquid around the tube, leading to much better heat transfer performance.Helically finned tubes are probably best for actual use. Helical fins which approach close to radially transverse flans are preferred. Two phase pressure drop measurements on bundles of the proposed ultra low fin tubing indicate that the large enhancement to heat transfer can be realized with little or no penalty in pressure drop per unit length of bundle. This is because the fins are small and the major component of pressure drop for flow across tube bundles is due to form drag, not friction drag. Form drag is resistance to flow around a blunt object and is present whether the tubing is finned or bare. Moreover, the enhanced heat transfer permits shorter exchanger bundles for a given heat duty, witch a consequent reduction tn the overall shellside pressure drop across the bundle. This can result in significant savtngs in both the capital and operating costs of the refrigerant compressors. Descrition of Geometric Parameters andOperative Limits of Ultra Low Fin Tubing Figure 1 shows the outer finned portion of a longitudinal cross section which contains the axis of a tube which has helically disposed ultra low fins of trapezoidal shape. The surface illustrated schematically in Figure l is that of an actual tube sample designated below as sample R2 prepared and tested by the inventors. It was produced by a three wheel roller head die which formed three continuous side by side helical fins with a small winding angle about the tube of 3.5 .Also illustrated in Figure l are the geometric parameters of the fins which apply as well for fins of rectangular, triangular and other related shapes and the approximate shape or profile of the refrigerant liquid vapor meniscus on the fins. Of course, the actual profile of the meniscus is constantly fluctuating because of the time varying nature of two phase flow and the effects of impinging liquid droplets falling from the tube above and droplets deposited on the tube or sheared off the tube by the vapor phase of the refrigerant, which moves through the heat exchanger at a higher velocity than the liquid phase. However, for purposes of the analysis below, the meniscus profile shown in Figure 1 will serve as a reasonable average. The nomenclature below defines the geometric parameters of the fins and other parameters of importance in the practice of thins invention b width of fin at the fin root diameterB width of flat or gap at the fin root diameterDo outer diameter of tube FD I ftn density or number of flans per unit length measured at the tube outer diameter Do along a direction normal to the direction of the fins.

L density of refrigerant liquid phase, e.g. 1bm ft2 V density of refrigerant vapor phase, e.g. 1bm ft2 a surface tension of refrigerant liquid, e.g. lbf ft or dynes cm The operative limits which are pertinent are those associated with the fins themselves. The fin dimensions H, W and w defined above are important. If the fin height H is too high, the following problems are encountered, although not necessarily at the same fin height The heat conduction path along the fin is lengthened and fin efficiency decreases to the extent that the effectiveness of the finned tubtng is reduced. pressure drop across the finned tube increases because of the increased contribution of frictional drag compared to form drag. The surface tension mechanism, which is the cause of the unexpectedly large heat transfer enhancement under two phase downflow vaporization conditions, would not be effective if the fin height was too large. In this case, the film thinning action of the surface tension forces would be relegated to an insignificantly small region near the fin crest, rather than acting more or less uniformly over much of the height of the fin.Making the fin height too small also presents problems Under two phase conditions, the spaces between the fins would flood completely with liquid and the effectiveness of the finned surface would be impaired. For single phase conditions, as the fin height is decreased while maintaining a constant tube outside diameter and a constant flow rate, the fins wlll eventually become comparable in size to the thickness of the thermal boundary layer on the tubing. As fin height is reduced further, the boundary layers completely swamp the fins, and the thermal performance of the finned tubing approaches that of bare tubing, yielding no advantage to heat transfer.Similarly, if the gap W between the fin crests is too large, the following difficulties ensue As W is increased, the magnitude is decreased of the surface tension forces which pull excess refrigerant liquid from the sides of the fins into the valleys, leading to less effective heat transfer. 5 Also, increasing W is equivalent to moving the fins farther apart, which decreases the heat transfer area per untt length of tubing. If W is made too small, too much of the space between the flans will be filled wlth slow drainlng liquid, again reducing the effectiveness of the heat transfer process.If the width of the fin crest w is too large, the following adverse effects occur As w is increased, the magnitude Is decreased of the surface tension forces which push excess refrigerant liquid from the crests onto the sides of the fins, leading to less effective heat transfer. Also, increasing w decreases the surface area per unit length of tubing. If the crest width w is made too small, the film thinning effect in the immediate vicinity of the crest region will be large, but the narrow tips of the fins will then present too much resistance to conduction of heat to the fin tips, leading to decreasing heat transfer effectiveness as w is decreased further. It should be noted that, whereas triangular shaped fins in principle have a fin crest w equal to zero, in practice there is always a finite crest width due to the limitations of fin forming operations machining, roll forming, extruding, etc. . It is seen from the above that, for successful practice of this invention, lower and upper bounds must be placed on H, W and w. As will be shown below, these bounds must also take into account the physical properties a, PL and V of the refrigerant. It is well known that fin efficiency decreases with an increase in fin height or heat transfer coefficient and increases with an increase tn fin thermal conductivity. The fins should be made from a metal with high thermal conductivity so that fin efficiencies remain high even for the high heat transfer coefficients obtained with the present invention. Preferred metals for the fins are copper, brass, aluminum or aluminium alloys. It is assumed that the refrigerant liquid wets the finned tube well contact angle between the liquid and metal is small and has a viscosity low enough so that viscous forces swithin the liquid film can be considered negligible compared wlth surface tension forces. Common refrigerants, the lower molecular weight hydrocarbons, cryogentc liquids and many other liquids satisfy these requirements.Definition of Heat Transfer Enhancement Factors The heat transfer coefficients ascertained for the finned surfaces of the examples which were tested under two phase conditions are termed effective coefficients since, in all cases, the coefficients were referenced to the surface area of a bare tube having the same outside diameter Do as the finned surface. The enhancement factor for a finned tube is defined as the ratio of the effective heat transfer coefficient for the finned tubing to the heat transfer coefficient for bare tubing. The finned and bare tubing samples which were tested all had essentially the same outside dlameters. The following definitions are made hf effective heat transfer coefficient for finned tubing referenced to the outside surface area of a bare tube with the same OD Do as the finned tubing hb heat transfer coefficient for bare tubing referenced to the outside surface area of bare tubing eq heat transfer enhancement factor at constant heat flux hf hb, both coefficients evaluated at the same heat flux eaT X heat transfer enhancement factor at constant wall to fluid temperature difference hf hb, both coefficients evaluated at the same temperature difference By definition, the heat flux q is related to h by q h T 1 It follows that eq and eT are given by eq 2 b q fq fq hb T qb T Also, Ao outside surface area per unit length of finned tubing e.g., in2 in Ao bare outside surface area per unit length of bare tubing with the same OD as the finned tubing e.g., in2 in Do Conventional practice in other heat transfer processes, such as condensation, used fins which were much taller than those of the invention, and it was believed that liquid films would essentially engulf the fins, leading to poor heat transfer performance.At the very best, conventional practice suggested that the heat transfer performance would be characterized by e T or e1 Ao Ao bare 4 and that the enhancement factor could equal the area ratioAo Ao bare only if all of the surface area was effective and if the finned tube heat transfer coefficient based on the actual finned tube area Ao was not somehow reduced in magnitude due to the very presence of the fins, as it is sometimes for single phase flow. However, the experimental program of the invention led to the unexpected finding that the fin parameters could be chosen to give e T or eq Ao Ao bare 5 The extent of enhancement measured was remarkable, as well as unexpected.Criteria for Surface Tension Auqmented HeatTransfer on Ultra Low Fin Tubing It was mentioned above that the physical properties a, L and Py of the refrigerant must be considered in practicing the present invention. It will now be shown how these physical properties are taken into account. Consider the refrigerant liquid vapor meniscus shown inFigure 1. The difference in pressure between a liquid and vapor at any point on a curved liquid vapor interface is given by Laplace s equation 1 1 PL PV 6 R1 R2 The principal radii of curvature R and R are defined to be 1 2 positive within the vapor phase and lie in any two mutually perpendicular planes whose line of intersection defines the normal to the point in question on the interface. If either radius of curvature lies within the liquid its sign becomes negative.In applying Equation 6 to the problem at hand, it is assumed that curvature effects in the direction normal to Figure 1 can be neglected i.e., in the direction parallel with the fin orientation. Accordingly, one of the two radii can be set equal to infinity, giving P1 P 7 R where R is now the local radlus of curvature of the liquid vapor interface in a plane normal to the fin orientation. The vapor pressurePy is constant and is equal to the bulk pressure of the two phase stream flowing past the ultra low finned tube. Therefore, Equation 7 gives the local variation of the pressure within the liquid film from the vapor phase or bulk pressure.At the crests of the fins, R is negative convex liquid film and Equation 7 indicates that PL is greater than Py. At the lowest point on the meniscus in the valleys between the fins, R is positive concave liquid film and PL is less than Py. The resulting pressure gradient within the liquid film causes very rapid draining of any liquid which impinges on the fin crests to the valleys between the fins. The magnitude of the pressure gradient within the liquid film can be estimated from the fin parameters. If Rc and Rv are the characteristic radii of curvature of the liquid film at the fin crest and valley, respectively, these radii can be represented by Rc w 8 2 W Rv 9 2 and Equation 7 , applied at the fin crest and valley, gives the following relation for the pressure difference within the liquid film between fin crest and valley surface tension induced 2 U 1 1 10 pressure difference w Because this pressure difference acts over a distance approximately equal to the fin height H, the surface tension induced pressure gradient within the liquid film is given by surface tension induced 2 , 1 1 pressure gradient H w i It is shown below that these surface tension induced pressure gradients can be very much larger than either gravitational or shear pressure drop forces.The resulting very thin films of liquid on the sides of the upper part of the fins results in extremely high heat transfer coefficients since the local heat transfer coefficient is commonly assumed to be inversely proportional to the local thickness of the liquid film. The bulk of the liquid will draln in the valleys between fins, giving lower heat transfer coefficients in the valleys than near the fin crests.However, the net effect can be an enhancement to heat transfer which is much larger than that expected based on the increase in surface area over that of bare tubing i.e., e T or e q Ao Ao bare 5 Based on the above, it is expected that the most effective fin geometries would be those for which the surface tension induced pressure gradients within the liquid films are greater than the net gravitational pressure gradient within the liquid films i.e., surface tension induced pressure gradient 1 12 net gravitational pressure gradient The denominator of Equation 12 is uniquely determined from the liquid and vapor densities and the local acceleration of gravity and is given by net gravitational pressure gradient PL u i 13 g c Using Equations ill and 13 , the criterion Equation 12 then becomes 2 o gc 1 1 1 14 g L V H W W For ultra low finned surfaces and refrigerants which satisfyEquation 14 , surface tension enhancement should occur at all polnts on the circumference of the tube because the liquid films can then be thinned even in opposition to the pull of gravity. For example, at the bottom of a hortzontal or near horizontal tube drainage will likely take place from the fin crests but thin films of liquid can still be pulled against the force of gravity up the sides of the fins to give high heat transfer coefficients. Table 1 lists the parameters of four finned tubes which have been tested for downflow vaporization of R ll refrigerant, composed of a halogenated hydrocarbon, under conditions set forth in the following example.

EXAMPLE The ultra low finned tubes, as well as bare tubes, were tested in in line, square pitch tube bundles in an apparatus as illustrated in FIGSA and B. The vapor quality weight fraction vapor of the flowing refrigerant was varied from zero all liquid to 0.9. Heat was supplied to the tubes with an electric cartridge heater. and the temperature difference between a known radial position in the wall of the tube and the fluid was measured directly and accurately musing an opposed thermoptle circuit. The instrumented tubes could be rotated about their axis within the tube bundle.This allowed the wall to fluid temperature difference to be averaged at many points around the circumference of the tubing A correction was then made for the wall temperature drop to obtain an average surface temperature, and the average heat transfer coefficient for the surface was calculated from the known heat flux q and the measured temperature difference between the surface and the fluid. As shown in FIG SB, the tube bundle 10 was mounted in a hollow cell 16 such that a serles of half and full diameter dummy tubes 12 and 14, respectively, surrounded the test tube 18 in order to place the tube in an accurate refrigerant flow environment. Vapor phase refrigerant entered the top of the cell 16 through an inlet 20 and liquid phase refrigerant entered the cell 16 through a distributor 22. The two phases mix in a plenum 24 and pass downwardly around the various tubes, exiting through a bottom outlet 28. The refrigerant is then recycled for flow through the cell 16 in the apparatus shown in FIG 5A. The cell 16 is shown with the vapor and liquid inlets 20 and 22. The discharge two phase refrigerant from outlet 28 is passed to a separation vessel 30 wherein all of the vapor phase is removed to be re condensed against cooling water in heat exchanger 32. The water circulates through conduits 34 and 36. Refrigerant liquid from the bottom of vessel 30 passes to a heated reboiler 38 wherein vapor is regenerated and passes through line 40 and flowmeter 42. Liquid is circulated via line 44 and pump 46 through a second flowmeter 48. In this manner, an accurate experimental envtronment was provided to test various samples of ultra low finned tube for the enhanced heat transfer effect set forth hereln. Figures 6 8 are scanning electron microscope SEM photomicrographs of the fins on the tubes tested. Each photograph is oriented so that the metal wall of the ultra low fin tubing is at the bottom of the photograph. Figure 6 shows two photomicrographs of a cross section the plane of which contains the axis of sample Fl2, sald sample havlng a single helically disposed ultra low fin, said fin being generally trapezoidal, but nearly triangular, in cross section. Figure 6A shows the fins at 26X magnification and Figure 6B shows the fins at 120X magnification. Figure 7 shows two photomlcrographs of a cross section the plane of which passes normal to the axis of sample Fl7, said sample having 100 longitudinally disposed ultra low fins on the circumference of the sample, said fins being generally trapezoldal, but nearly triangular, in cross section. Figure 7A shows the fins at 4OX magnification, whileFigure 7B shows the fins at 120X magnification. Figure 8 shows two photomicrographs of a cross section the plane of which contains the axis of sample R2, said sample having three contiguous helically disposed ultra low fins, said fins being generally trapezoidal in cross section. Figure 8A shows the fins at 20X magnification. Figure 88 shows the fins at 6OX magnification. Figure 2 shows the measured constant heat flux enhancement factor eq for finned surfaces Fl2 and Fl7 which constitute examples of the invention. Both of these surfaces had fins of approxlmately similar shape and dimensions. Although the longitudinally finned sample Fl7 had nearly 17 more surface area than the approximately radially finned sample F12, sample Fl2 gave clearly superior performance and illustrates the unexpected degree of enhancement which is the main focus of thisInvention i.e., sample Fl2 has eq Ao Ao bare 15 On the other hand, sample Fl7 with longitudinal flans has eq Ao Ao bare 16 Figure 2 also shows that sample Fl2 s unexpected degree of enhancement continues to persist even at vapor quallties as large as 0.9, indicating that surface tension forces are probably very large compared to vapor shear effects. This is demonstrated below for sampleR2.Figure 3 shows the measured constant temperature dlfference enhancement factor e T for the rolled fin sample R2. Over a wide range of conditions, this surface had enhancement factors which were unexpectedly greater than Ao Ao bare This area ratio was 2.45 for sample R2. Values of e T as large as 7.1 were measured for AT 0.3 F.This is almost 200 larger than the maximum enhancement which conventional practice would lead one to believe is possible i.e., e T or eq maximum Ao Ao bare 17 It is significant to note from Figure 3 that, for vapor qualities less than 0.9, the enhancement factor increases as the surface to bulk temperature difference decreases. This makes the invention particularly attractive for cryogenic heat transfer applications, which operate generally at small temperature differences. The surface tension induced pressure gradient within the liquid film is calculated below for sample R2 and compared with net gravitational and two phase flow pressure gradients. Restating Equation 11 , we have surface tension induced 2 1 1 11 pressure gradient H w W where, for sample R2 and refrigerant R 11 at 76 F, we have surface tension induced pressure gradient 2 18.34 dynes cm 1 1 10 6 bar x 14.5 psi 0.0264 in. 2.54 cm in. 0.0087 in. 0.0143 in. dynes cm2 bar 1.47 psi inch This is a very respectable pressure gradient and, in fact, is much larger than pressure gradients normally used in the design of liquidflow conduits.The net gravitational pressure gradient associated with a column of R ll liquid can be shown to be small compared with this surface tension induced pressure gradient. At 76 F, this net gravitational gradient is found from Equation 13 to be q 92.227 0.374 32.17 L V 0.0532 psi inch 32.17 144 12 This is about 28 times smaller than the surface tension induced pressure gradient. It can be similarly shown that the pressure gradient for two phase flow through a bundle of the rolled fin tubing is also small compared with the surface tension induced pressure gradient. Two phase, downflow, pressure drop data for a bundle of finned tubes identical with sample R2 are shown in Figure 4. The largest pressure drop measured for 6 40000 lbm hr ft2 was 0.213 inches of water per row of tubes.Given a bundle longitudinal pitch ratio of 1.189 and a tube outside dlameter of 0.3930 , the following representative pressure gradient for the rolled fin bundle can be calculated 0.213Two phase pressure 0.0164 psi inch of bundle 1 18 0.3930 27 76 gradient Remarkably, this is about 90 times smaller than the surface tenston induced pressure gradient. If it is recognized that most of the two phase pressure drop is probably associated with form drag, drag due to flow around a blunt object and present whether the tubes are finned or bare, the actual pressure gradient attributable to vapor shear forces could be smaller than the surface tension induced pressure gradient by a factor much larger than 90. Figure 4 is a graph showing pressure drop data for downward two phase flow of refrigerant ll over a bare tube bundle and a bundle of rolled fin tubing identical to ultra low fin sample R2. These data show that the very significant heat transfer enhancement of the present invention can be obtalned with no significant penalty in pressure drop per unit length of bundle. Moreover, for a given heat transfer duty, the enhanced heat transfer will allow shorter bundle lengths to be used, with a consequent significant reductlon in the overall pressure drop across the bundle. Table 2 summarizes various calculated parameters for the four finned tubes of the examples which were tested, as well as the measured heat transfer enhancement factors for these surfaces. The helically finned samples Fl2, RF2 and R2 all exhibited unexpectedly large enhancement factors. Practically, the fins on these three samples can be considered to be close to true radlal transverse fins because of their small helical winding angle 8. For sample RF2, the extent to which the enhancement factor exceeded Ao Ao bare was small, but nevertheless significant. The copper fins on this sample were held to the aluminum tube only by tension, so some contact resistance was undoubtedly present.It is likely that the performance of sample RF2 could have been markedly improved by eliminating the contact resistance by soldering or welding the fins to the tube. Sample Fl7 with longttudtnal fins was the only one to exhibit enhancement factors which were less than Ao Ao bare. A possible explanation for the poorer performance of longitudinally finned tubes was given earlier.

It can be seen from Table 2 that all of the approxlmately radially finned surfaces which exhibited unexpectedly large enhancement factors also satisfied Equation 14 t.e., 2 a 9c 1 1 1 14 9 pL pV H w W Equation 14 can be considered a necessary condition for the successful practice of the present invention however, it is not a sufficient condition. For example, ultra low fins designed for the vaporization of a given refrigerant according to Equation 14 will not display the high enhancements of the present invention if the ultra low finned tubing is totally immersed in the liquid refrigerant.The liquid phase of the refrigerant must be deposited on the tubing in the form of thin films of liquid. Also, while it is clear that, for a given refrigerant and fin shape, the left hand side of Equation 14 can be made as large as desired by decreasing the fin dimensions H, w andW , an upper limit must be placed on the left hand side of Equation 14 to avoid completely flooding the valleys between the fins with the liquid refrigerant. The experiments, summarized in Table 2, and the remarks presented herein lead to the following criterion to obtain the unusual extent of enhancement of the present invention 1 2 gc 1 1 200 18 g L V H w W In using this criterion, the refrigerant properties a, sL and determine the size or height of a fin of given geometry. Once the refrigerant is chosen, the lower limit in Equation 18 determines the largest fin size for which surface tension augmented heat transfer will occur. Similarly, the upper limit in Equation 18 determines the smallest fin size for which the surface tension enhancement mechanism will not be excessively inhibited by liquid flooding between the fins. Within reasonable variation, the exact shape of the ultra low fins protruding from the surface of the tubing is not important in the practice of the present invention. However, a trapezoidal fin cross section is preferred for coil wound exchangers because trapezoidal fins are relatively easy to form and can be made sufficiently robust to resist significant deformation during the winding process. Localized deformation of fins at points of contact wlth other finned tubes or spacer elements is significant only to the extent that dimensional tolerances clearance between tube layers, ultimate diameter of the coil wound bundle, etc. are affected. For a given refrigerant, it is clear from Equation 18 that there is no single unique fin design which gives the unexpected enhancement of the present invention. Zany successful fin configurations are possible depending on the shape of the fin cross section and on the choice of the fin dimensions H, w and W. A good fin design will provide for adequate drainage space between the fins while at the same time maintaining a large surface area per unlit length of tubing relative to bare tubing. In the preferred embodiment of the invention, it is recommended that the fin dimensions be chosen such that w W ll 19 The present invention has been set forth with regard to several preferred embodiments.
