# Method of manufacture of catalytic electrodes with coatings comprising platinum group electrocatalysts.

## Abstract
A catalytic electrode has an electrically conductive subs trate such as titanium with a coating comprising a platinum group metal catalyst finely dispersed in a matrix consisting of a semi conducting polymer formed in situ on the substrate. The catalyst may be a platinum group metal oxide such as iridium oxide formed in situ together with the semi conducting polymer by the application of a uniform liquid mixture followed by a controlled heat treatment. The semi conducting polymer is preferably formed from polyacrylonitrile, polybenzimidazo pyrrolone or an adaman tane based polybenzoxazole.
