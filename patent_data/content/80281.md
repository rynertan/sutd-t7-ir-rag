A monomeric condensation product of the type mentioned above that has more recently become commerically available is the compound known by the common name diazolidinyl urea and also by the trade name Germall II . That compound is N hydroxyinethyl N 1, 3 dihydroxymethyl 2, 5 dioxo 4 imidazolidinyl N hydroxymethyl urea, and has the formulaEMI4.1 It is described in US 4 271 176 issued 2 June 1981 to Berke Rosen, assignors to Sutton Laboratories,Inc. corresponding to WO 81 00566, published 5March 1981, and EP 0 032 500 . Imidazolidinyl urea has been used for some time as a preservative in a wide variety of cosmetic and toiletry products, and much work has been published regarding its antibacterial properties in that respect a both alone and in conjunction with other preservatives.Diazolidinyl urea has been described for use as an antibacterial and antifungal preservative in various cosmetic and toiletry products, especially in creams and lotions, such as shampoos, in a manner similar to that described for imidazolidinyl urea. It has now been found that imidazolidinyl urea, diazolidinyl urea and related allantoinformaldehyde condensation products are also useful in the therapeuic treÅatment of humans and animals. This is particularly surprising since it is some considerable time since these condensation products were first described a and imidazolidinyl urea in particular has been commercially available for a number of years and has been widely used in cosmetic and toiletry products. Yet there has not previously been any suggestion that the antimicrobial activity of these condensation products could be useful beyond the field of the preservation of cosmetic and toiletry products.In particular, there has not previously been any suggestion that these condensation products could be useful in the therapeutic treatment of humans and animals. Moreover, very many compounds are used as preservatives in cosmetic and toiletry products but their antimicrobial action in that respect does not necessarily suit them for use for therapeutic purposes.Indeed, very many cosmetic preservatives are unsuitable for therapeutic purposes. The present invention accordingly now provides a monomeric, dimeric or polymeric compound that is a condensation product of formaldehyde and allantoin in a molar proportion of 1 to at least 0.5, respectively, in which the monomeric compound or each monomeric unit is of the general formulaEMI5.1 in which each R denotes H, CH20E or with the provisos that a in a monomeric compound, R cannot denote CH2 1 2 and at least one R denotes CR2OH, b in each unit of a dimeric compound and in each terminal unit of a polymeric compound, at least one symbol R denotes CH2 1 2, c in each non terminal unit of a polymeric compound, each of at least two symbols R denotes CH2 1 2 or a physiologically tolerable salt of such a compound, for use in the therapeutic treatment of humans or animals. The present invention also provides a composition which comprises a therapeutically effective amount of a monomeric, dimeric or polymeric compound of the type defined above, or a physiologically tolerable salt of such a compound, in admixture or conjunction with a pharmaceutically or veterinarily suitable carrier. The said compound is preferably imidazolidinyl urea or diazolidinyl urea. The compounds used according to the invention which are also referred to herein as the allantoinformaldehyde condensation products and as the condensation products11 and their physiologically tolerable salts may be used against a wide range of diseases and disorders of the human or animal body. They find particularly efficacious use as antimicrobial agents in the therapeutic treatment of humans and animals, but there are also instances where their therapeutic efficacy cannot be attributed simply to antimicrobial action. Moreover, it seems that, in many cases, the compounds and their physiologically tolerable salts show a potentiating effect when used in combination with known drugs.The compounds and the salts are especially useful in the therapeutic treatment of diseases, malconditions and other disorders of the skin and other membranes of the human or animal body. The terms compound and condensation product , and like terms, as used hereinafter include the said physiologically tolerable salts unless the context requires otherwise. The minimum therapeutically effective amount of a compound used according to the invention will depend on a number of factors, not least of which is the type of composition in which it is incorporated.In all cases, however, the minimum therapeutically effective amount will be a concentration that is greater than that which would be required if the compound were present in the composition merely as a preservative to prevent bacterial or fungal growth in the composition. The therapeutically effective amount is generally more than 1 by weight and, at least in some compositions, is advantageously at least 1.5 by weight there are applications for which the concentration of the compound in the composition is advantageously at least 2 by weight, preferably at least 5 by weight all percentages being based on the total weight of the composition. The antimicrobial properties of imidazolidinyl urea are primarily antibacterial that is to say, both bactericidal and bacteriostatic properties, whereas the antimicrobial properties of diazolidinyl urea include both antibacterial properties and also antifungal properties that is to say, activity against yeasts, moulds and other fungal microorganisms . Diazolidinyl urea is in general effective against all microorganisms against which imidazolidinyl urea is effective, and its activity is generally greater than that of imidazolidinyl urea. Diazolidinyl urea has, for example, been found to be effective, at a concentration of 0.2 , against gram negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027 and Escherichia coli ATCC 10536 , and also against P. cepacia at a concentration of 0.5 or at a concentration of 0.3 in combination withParabens. In fact, diazolidinyl urea is about 20 more effective against Pseudomonas, which is a pathogen that it is important to be able to combat, than is imidazolidinyl urea.Moreover, diazolidinyl urea has also been found to be effective against yeasts, moulds and other fungi it has, for example, been found to be effective against A. niter ATCC 16404 at a concentration as low as 0.1 and against C. albicans ATCC 10231 at a concentration of 0.3 to 0.4 . The antimicrobial properties of these compounds may be used against a wide range of pathogens associated with diseases and other disorders in both humans and animals. In particular, they are useful for the non antibiotic chemotherapeutic treatment of both humans and animals for both prophylactic that is to say, preventive and curative purposes. The term therapeutic treatment and like terms as used herein include both prophylactic treatment and curative treatment, unless the context requires otherwise. These compounds are particularly useful in siutations where antibiotics especially p lactam antibiotics, such as penicillins and cephalosporins cannot, or cannot effectively, be used, and also in situations where the use of antibiotics would be undesirable.They can, for example, be used for the treatment of pathogens that have become resistant to certain antibiotics. Moreover, because of their low toxicity, they can also be used in higher concentrations than those in which antibiotics can be used, and because of their low irritancy they can also be used in higher concentrations than those in which many other non antibiotic chemotherapeutic substances can be used. Various properties of the compounds, in addition to their activity against a large number of micro organisms, render them suitable for a wide variety of veterinary, pharmaceutical and like applications.As mentioned above the compounds have a low toxicity, which not only means that they can be used in higher concentrations than can more toxic drugs, but also means that they can be administered more freely and more safely, without any substantial risk of adverse effects caused by inadvertant overdosage or of side effects. Also, the risks of environmental pollution are substantially reduced. Diazolidinyl urea is more toxic than is imidazolidinyl urea, but its toxicity is still at a very low level. The compounds also have a low irritancy, so that they can broadly be described as non irritant.Indeed, in some cases, the compounds show an antiirritant effect, that is to say that, not only do they cause no irritancy themselves, but they can in fact reduce irritancy caused by other substances. The low irritancy of the compounds again enables them to be used in higher concentrations than can many other drugs, and also enables them to be used on highly sensitive tissue, for example on burns and lacerations, in the eye, on cattle udders, and internally. Many of the compounds are water soluble and can therefore be formulated more easily than can waterinsoluble drugs and they can be used for purposes for which water insoluble drugs are not suitable. The water solubility of those compounds also enables them to be more readily absorbed into the body. The compounds also have film forming properties, which are useful for certain applications, especially where the drug is to be applied externally and might otherwise readily become removed more quickly than desired. In the veterinary field, the compounds are particularly useful in the prevention or cure of mastitis, primarily in cattle. They are also useful in the treatment of the intestines to counteract various enteric infections, for example neo natal scour and gastro enteritis in various animals including, for example, cattle, lambs, foals, pigs, poultry, fish, and exotic animals in the treatment of the uterus to counteract uterine infections, such as acute endometritis, which can occur in many animals, especially horses in the treatment of animal hooves, to counteract foul in the foot and other types of foot rot in the treatment of the ears and eyes of animals and also in the treatment of fish, particularly in fish farming, for example be being inc orporated in a fish feed or by being used in a treatment tank. In the pharmaceutical field, these compounds are particularly useful in the treatment of diseases, malconditions and other disorders of the skin, including, especially, ammoniacal dermatitis in the form of nappy rash and bed sores, for example and also acne, ulcers, and other dermatological conditions. They are also useful in the chemotherapeutic treatment of burns, skin grafts and skin lacerations of the human body. Furthermore, they may be used in a mouthwash for, for example, pre dental or post dental treatment and in the treatment of ears and eyes of humans and in the treatment of contact lenses, for example in eye drops and in solutions for wetting, cleaning or storing contact lenses whether hard or soft lenses . The compounds may also be used for various surgical and like purposes. The compounds,may, for example, be applied to or incorporated in for example, by impregnation and, for example, in the form of a powder or in the form of a solution surgical dressing including plasters, lint, and other wound dressings of any nature whether intended for use in a clinical, domestic, industrial or other situation , surgical swabs for example, pre operative swabs and the like. Solutions of the compounds, optionally containing other substances, may be used for treating surgical instruments, surgical apparatus and the like, for cleaning and sterilisation purposes, and also for treating articles used for preparing, containing or administering food, especially baby food.The compounds may be used in a peritoneal or other lavage and in an enema, for example for intestinal sterilisation prior to surgical operations on the large or small intestines. The compounds may also be incorporated in surgical soap or the like used by surgeons and their assistants in scrubbing up , in an amount sufficient to be effective in aiding sterilisation of the surgeon s or assistant s hands. The compounds may furthermore be used in the treatment of milk for preservation purposes. The compounds may be formulated for pharmaceutical or veterinary use, that is to say, for the therapeutic treatment of the human or animal body, in a variety of forms depending on the particular intended use.They may be incorporated in pharmaceutical, veterinary or like compositions, in admixture or conjunction with a carrier which term, Åas used herein, includes an excipient . The composition may, for example, be formulated for external application to humans or animals or for internal application to humans or animals. The compositions may be formulated in unitdosage form. The carrier incorporated in the composition should be a pharmaceutically or veterinarily suitable carrier. The carrier may comprise one or more carriers selected from a a non liquid carrier, optionally in conjunction with a liquid carrier a b a liquid carrier other than water, optionally in conjunction with water, and c water in conjunction with another substance. For a number of purposes the carrier may comprise physiologically tolerable saline solution. The compositions according to the invention may be formulated in a wide variety of forms, using a wide variety of carriers and auxiliaries. Examples of types of formulation suitable for the treatment of animals include compositions for parenteral or external application to cattle udders, for example in the form of a gel or jelly, or in the form of a solution or other liquid compositions for enteral administration to animals, for example a bolus for use with larger animals, for example calves, sheep and other ruminants or a capsule or tablet for use with smaller animals, for example cats and dogs formulation as a uterine infusion compositions for external application to animal hooves, for example as a spray, especially a water based spray compositions for external application to the ears or eyes of animals, for example as an ointment or as ear or eye drops and formulation as an aqueous solution, for a variety of applications. Examples of types of formulation suitable for the treatment of humans include various preparations for application to the skin of humans for example creams, jellies, gels, ointments, sprays and the like as well as preparations for external application to the ears or eyes of humans1 for example ointments and ear and eye drops formulation as a mouthwash and formulation as capsules1 tablets1 pills and the like for enteral administration. Compositions according to the invention for the therapeutic treatment of animals may contain the active ingredient in concentrations of anything up to 100 , depending on the intended use of the particular formulation, but advantageously concentrations of up to 50 by weight, preferably up to 20 by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, are used. Compositions according to the invention for the therapeutic treatment of humans may contain the active ingredient in concentrations of up to 30 by weight, although for some purposes the concentration advantageously does not exceed 20 by weight, and for some purposes preferably does not exceed 109 0 by weight,in each case based on the total weight of the composition. The compositions according to the invention may contain other therapeutically active ingredients for example, topical asteroids, antibiotics, and other antimicrobial agents , as well as topical anaesthetics, preservatives, emulsifiers, dispersants, propellants, thickening agents, colouring agents, buffers, flavouring agents, sweetening agents, carriers including excipients, solvents, and solid and liquid diluents , binders, disintegrants, lubricants, and other conventional auxiliaries. The choice of auxiliaries for any particular composition will, of course, be affected by the type of composition, whether the composition is intended for internal or external application, and whether it is intended for animal or human use.The auxiliaries used should, of course, normally be physiologically tolerable, especially when the composition is intended for internal application.The compositions according to the invention may be prepared in a conventional manner known to those skilled in the art. It is often advantageous for the compositions according to the invention additionally to comprise esters of par para hydroxybenzoic acid, preferably alkyl para hydroxybenzoates, especially C1 Co alkyl para hydroxybenzoates which are commonly known as the tParabens Paraben is a registered TradeMark , for example, methyl or propyl hydroxybenzoate.Such additives tend to improve the activity of the compositions they can have a synergistic or potentiating effect in conjunction with the allantoinformaldehyde condensation products used according to the invention. Such additives are preferably used in amounts of at least 2 by weight, based on the weight of the allantoin formaldehyde condensation product present in the particular composition. They may typically be present in the compositions in amounts of from 0.01 to 5 by weight, based on the total weight of the respective composition. Depending on the nature and intended use of the particular composition, it can be advantageous to ensure that those additives are not present in an amount exceeding their solubility in the particular composition in question. It is also often advantageous for the compositions according to the invention additionally to comprise soluble allantoin, because of its therapeutic properties. One important veterinary application of the allantoin formaldehyde condensation products used according to the invention is their use for the treatment or prevention of mastitis, especially in cattle The udder tissue of cattle provides a very good breeding ground for a wide variety of both gram negative and gram positive pathogens including, for example, Staphvlococcus aureus StreDtococcus bovis, Str aalactia, Str. disgalactia, Str. uberis, Escherichia coli, Corynebactrium pyoqenes, and Pseudomonas aeruqinosa.The udder tissue is very sensitive and it is therefore important that any formulations or other preparations used for treating the udder should have a low irritancy.The treatment of mastitis in cattle has hitherto generally been carried out using antibiotics, but their prolonged use can create problems of the pathogens developing resistance to the antibiotics used, and many of the pathogens mentioned above are now considered to be penicillin resistant, ss a result of over exposure to sub lethal doses of various antibiotics. Moreover, the use of antibiotics on lactating cows can create public health problems, and for antibiotics to be fully effective clinical typing is necessary. Mammary products based on the allantoinformaldehyde condensation products used according to the invention can be used for the non antibiotic chemotherapeutic treatment of mastitis without many of the disadvantages associated with the use of antibiotics. These products have a bactericidal action against many of the pathogens associated with mastitis, of both gram negative and gram positive types, and including penicillin resistant strains.They could, therefore, be effective in overcoming a situation where a disease had become endemic.These products also have several other advantages rendering them very suitable for this purpose they have a very low degree of irritancy in the udder they have a very low toxicity, which means that they can be used in suckled cows without danger to the calves and also that there is no danger to human consumers of milk from treated cows they are water soluble and are therefore effective when used in a medium such as milk and they are not inhibited by the presence of proteins such as are present in milk on the contrary, there is a potentiating effect, which can be valuable. Compositions according to the invention intended for the treatment of lactating cows may suitably be formulated as an intramammary product for parenteral application, for example in the form of a gel or the like, especially a thin gel that can be injected into the teat. A composition according to the invention intended for intramammary use may contain from 1 to 10 by weight, preferably up to 7.5 by weight, and especially from 1 to 2 by weight, of the allantoin formaldehyde condensation product, based on the total weight of the composition.The greater is the concentration used, the longer is the retention time of the active ingredient in the milk.The milk would not normally be used for human consumption while it still retains some active ingredient and it is therefore advantageous that the retention time should not be too long. With an active ingredient content in the composition of about 1 to 2 , the milk may be free of active ingredient after as few as two milkings, but in any case milk from the initial milkings can be fed to calves, whereas when using intramammary products containing antibiotics the milk would have had to be wasted. The retention time of imidazolidinyl urea is lower than that of diazolidinyl urea, but the efficacy of the former compound is also low. It can be advantageous to use a mixture of those two compounds as the active ingredient. A composition formulated for intramammary use of a lactating cow may suitably comprise from 1 to 7.5 by weight of imidazolidinyl urea and or diazolidinyl urea from 10 to 25 by weight of a carrier, preferably a water soluble or water miscible carrier, for example glycerine, propylene glycol, sorbitol, or another polyhydric alcohol from 0.1 to 1 of benzoic acid or a hydroxybenzoate, preferably in a concentration not exceeding its solubility in water from 0.1 to 7.5 of a gelling or thickening agent, for example, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, starch, or xanthan gum and water to 1000 o all percentages being based on the total weight of the composition. Compositions according to the invention intended for the mammary treatment of a dry cow may be formulated in a similar manner to the intramammary product described above but with a higher proportion of gelling or thickening agent to give a more viscous product. Such a product may be injected into the mouth of the teat where, on exposure to air, it will dry to form a rubbery product that will block the teat canal, thus preventing the ingress of infection from flies, for example. Alternatively, for use on a dry cow, a composition may be formulated as a gel, jelly, cream, ointment, wax or the like for extramammary use. An oily as distinct from aqueous composition may be prepared for use on a dry cow so that it will not easily be washed away. Compositions for use on a dry cow may contain up to 10 by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, of the allantoin formaldehyde condensation product, and preferably contain at least 5 by weight thereof. They may also contain allantoin to assist in healing any damage to the udder.A composition formulated for extramammary use on a dry cow may suitably comprise from 5 to 10 by weight of imidazolidinyl urea and or diazolidinyl urea up to 95 by weight of a carrier, for example from 50 to 75 by weight of aluminium stearate and from 10 to 35 by weight of liquid paraffin or of a mixture of glycerine and up to 5 by weight of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose up to 10 by weight of an emulsifier, for example a polysorbate, such as Tween 80 Tween is a registered Trade Mark and from 0.05 to 4 by weight of a hydroxy benzoate all percentages being based on the total weight of the composition. Compositions according to the invention may also be formulated as an aqueous solution for use as an udder wash and for washing teat tips. Another veterinary application of the allantoin formaldehyde condensation products is their use in the treatment of enteric infections, for example neo natal scour and gastro enteritis in calves, lambs, foals, and other animals.Pathogens associated with these conditions includeEscherichia coli and the Salmonella group, both of which inhabit the intestines and, under disease conditions, can cause severe damage or even death.These conditions have previously been treated with antibiotics, sulphonamide drugs, and cilloramphenicol. The use of chloramphenicol for this purpose is, however, now banned in the United Kingdom, and the pathogens have developed strains that are resistant to antibiotics and even to trimethoprim sulphonamide products. The low irritancy and toxicity of the allantoin formaldehyde products mean that they can safely be given to animals in sufficiently large doses for bactericidal effectiveness in enteral use. Because they are water soluble, they will diffuse through the contents of the gut quickly, thus improving their effectiveness.They have been found to be effective against both types of pathogens mentioned above, including penicillin resistant strains, and, morever, as mentioned previously, there is a potentiating effect in the presence of proteins, which usually constitute an important component in the diet of young animals. Diazolidinylurea intended for the treatment of enteric infections may be formulated as oral preparations, such as a bolus for use with large animals and capsules, pills or tablets for use with smaller animals . Such compositions in the form of a bolus, capsules, pills, tablets and the like may contain the allantoin formaldehyde products in concentrations of up to 15 by weight, especially from 2.5 to 15 by weight, based on the total weight of the composition excluding, in the case of capsules, the shell of the capsule , in admixture or conjunction with excipients, bulking agents, lubricating agents, disintegrating agents, binding agents and other conventional auxiliaries. Capsules, pills and tablets may, for example, be prepared in two sizes a capsule of which the contents is up to 0.8 g, or a pill or tablet of up to 0.8 g, for use with small animals, for example cats and small dogs and a capsule of which the contents is up to 2 g, or a pill or tablet of up to 2 g, for use with slightly larger animals, for example large dogs.Boluses may be 5 to 6 g in weight. A composition in the form of a bolus may suitably comprise from 5 to 15 by weight of imidazolidinyl urea and or diazolidinyl urea, in admixture with excipients, for example from 5 to 15 of microcrystalline cellulose, from 10 to 25 of starch, from 40 to 80 of lactose, and from 0.1 to 2 of magnesium stearate, with a colouring agent as required, all percentages being based on the total weight of the composition. The bolus should preferably be water swellable and should preferably disintegrate within 0.5 to 1 minute as measured in vitro in accordance with the British Pharmacopoeia . A composition in the form of a capsule may suitably comprise, as the capsule contents, from 2.5 to 15 by weight of imidazolidinyl urea and or diazolidinyl urea, in admixture with up to 97.5 by weight of an excipient, for example starch, lactose, calcium phosphate, or cellulose, and up to 2 by weight of a lubricant, for example stearic acid, all percentages being based on the total weight of the capsule contents. A further veterinary application of the allantoinformaldehyde products is the treatment of uterine infections, especially acute endometritis. This can occur in most animals, but can be an especial problem in horses. It is caused by the presence in the uterus of pathogens such as Streptococcus zoeipidemieus, haemolytic Escherichia coli theKlebsiella group, and Staphyloccocus aureus all of which have been found to be vulnerable to imidazolidinyl urea. Drugs intended for use as uterine infusions need to be water soluble, of low irritancy, of low toxicity, and effective in the biological environment of the uterus, the allantoin formaldehyde products meet all those desiderata. Moreover, because of their low toxicity and low irritancy, those products can be incorporated in a uterine infusion in a relatively high concentration if that should be necessary.The high degree of efficacy and safety of the allantoin formaldehyde products make them valuable for use in animals of high commerical value, for example hórses. Compositions according to the invention formulated for uterine infusion may suitably contain the allantoin formaldehyde condensation products, advantageously in concentrations of up to 10 by weight, preferably from 2 to 10 by weight, especially from 2 to 5 by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, in admixture or conjunction with physiologically tolerable saline solution. Such a composition may for example, comprise from 2 to 10 by weight of imidazolidinyl urea and or diazolidinyl urea, from 0.1 to 3 by weight of a hydroxybenzoate from 2 to 8 of water a colouring agent as desired and buffered normal saline to 100so by weight all percentages being based on the total weight of the composition. The allantoin formaldehyde condensation products may also be used in the treatment of foul in the foot, which can be a serious winter problem with both cattle and sheep. This disease is caused by Fusiformis necrophorus and Fusiformis nodosus it can be specially prevalent in wet muddy conditions and it is easily transmitted. It has in the past been treated with chloramphenicol, but the use of that drug for this purpose is now banned in theUnited Kingdom. Again the low irritancy and low toxicity of the condensation products means that they can be used in high concentrations when necessary, and their low toxicity also means that there is little risk to humans in the vicinity even during long treatment sessions.Persistence of a drug is important in any type of treatment of hooves and that is aided by the film forming properties of the condensation products a used according to the invention. For use in the treatment of animal hooves, the compositions according to the invention may suitably be formulated for application as a spray, comprising the condensation products in admixture or conjunction with a film forming agent and a volatile diluent. The composition may, for example, comprise from 5 to 30 by weight of imidazolidinyl urea and or diazolidinyl urea from 1 to 5 by weight of a film forming agent other than the allantoin formaldehyde condensation products , for example polyvinyl pyrollidone from 5 to 15 by weight of an alcohol, for example ethanol up to 100 o by weight of water and a volatile solvent, for example 2,2 dimethyl 1,3dioxalane 4 methanol, to 10056 all percentages being based on the total weight of the composition. An important pharmaceutical application of the allantoin formaldehyde condensation products is their use in the treatment of dermatological conditions. One dermatological condition where they may be particularly useful is ammoniacal dermatitis.This condition occurs, generally as a result of urinary incontinence, primarily in paediatric and geriatric patients, in the form of nappy rash or bed sores, for example. Urine on the skin is decomposed by bacteria of the Proteus group with the liberation of ammonia, thus resulting in the establishment of a local alkaline environment on the skin. This enables pathogens such as Pseudomonas, Escherichia coli the Klebsiella group, and the Citrobactic group to thrive, with resulting inflammation of the skin. Effective treatment of this condition can be difficult. It is necessary to use a substance that is effective against pathogens such as Pseudomonas, which can be difficult to combat, and that is effective in both alkaline and acid environments, because the local alkaline environment has to be changed to the natural acid mantle of the skin. It is also important that the substance used should have a low irritancy, in order that the skin should not be irritated further, and that it should have a low toxicity, because in the treatment of conditions of this nature the drug is spread over a large absorptive area. Few materials have previously been found that satisfy all those conditions, and some of the substances currently used for treating ammoniacal dermatitis are not adequately effective against Pseudomonas.The present allantoin formaldehyde condensation products are effective in acid conditions, and have low irritancy and low toxicity, and they may therefore be used against ammoniacal dermatitis. Another dermatological condition against which the present products may be used is acne, which is a form of pustular dermatitis associated with pathogens of the Staphvlococcus group, for example. S. aureus, S. albus, and S. epidermidis.Those pathogens have a particular ability to produce mutants and resistant strains, which make it difficult to treat this condition successfully by means of antibiotics. The present products are effective against those pathogens and have the advantages mentioned above in relation to ammoniacal dermatitis resulting from their low irritancy and low toxicity. Those properties also mean that the compounds may be used in concentrations adequate to counteract both acute and chronic conditions of acne. The present products may also be used against the skin condition known as ichthyosis, which is very difficult to treat by means of known drugs. Compositions according to the invention for use in the treatment of dermatological conditions, may be formulated as gels, jellies, creams, ointments or the like, which may contain the active substance in a concentration of at least 1 by weight, advantageously not more than 20 by weight, and preferably from 1 to 10 by weight, based on the total weight of the composition. A composition according to the invention formulated as a cream for the treatment of dermatological conditions may suitably comprise from 1 to 20 by weight of imidazolidinyl urea and or diazolidinyl urea up to 5 by weight of another antibacterial agent, for example a quaternary ammonium derivative, such as cetyl pyridinium chloride from 5 to 15 by weight of an emulsifier, for example cetostearyl alcohol from 0.1 to 3 of a hydroxybenzoate up to 25 of a protective agent, for example silicone fluid from 15 to 90 by weight of a carrier, for example liquid paraffin, glycerol, or lanolin and water to 100 by weight, all percentages being based on the total weight of the composition.If the cream is intended for the treatment of acne, the imidazolidinyl urea and or diazolidinyl urea is preferably present in a concentration of from 1 to 10 by weight, and the composition may additionally comprise up to 10 by weight of benzoyl peroxide, up to 2 by weight of halquinol, and up to 25 by weight of sulphur, preferably crystalline sulphur. A composition formulated as a jelly for external human application may suitably comprise from 1 to 10 by weight of imidazolidinyl urea and or diazolidinyl urea from 0.1 to 3 by weight of a hydroxybenzoate from 5 to 30 by weight of a smoothing agent, for example glycerine or polyethylene glycol from 1 to 10 by weight of a thickening agent, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, xanthan gum or Carbopol Trade Mark up to 5 by weight of a topical anaesthetic, for example lignocaine and water to 100 by weight all percentages being based on the total weight of the composition. A composition formulated as an ointment for external human or animal application may suitably comprise from 1 to 10 by weight of imidazolidinyl urea and or diazolidinyl urea from 0.1 to 3 by weight of a hydroxybenzoate up to 5 by weight of a topical steroid, for example hydrocortisone acetate up to 10 by weight of an oil, for example cod liver oil up to 5 by weight of a deodorising agent,for example chlorophyll up to 98 by weight of a polyhydric alcohol, for example polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol or glycerine up to 2 by weight of an aromatic oil for example neoroli or abietis oil and a colouring agent as required all percentages being based on the total weight of the composition. The allantoin formaldehyde condensation products may also be used in the therapeutic treatment of tissue damaged by burns of first, second or minor degree , lacerations, and the like in both humans and animals. Tissue that has been damaged in that manner is highly sensitive and any substance used to treat it must therefore have a very low irritancy even at high concentrations. The damaged tissue is liable to invasion by environmental pathogens and can readily absorb the toxins that they produce. One of the most persistent pathogens, and also one of the most difficult to combat, is Pseudomonas. That pathogen cannot easily be controlled by antibiotics but, on the other hand, most non antibiotic chemotherapeutic agents are too irritant to use on damaged tissue.The allantoin formaldehyde condensation products used according to the invention are, however, very suitable for this purpose because of their effectiveness against Pseudomonas, combined with their low irritancy. Moreover, because they are water soluble, they can be used in an aqueous medium that is compatible with tissue fluids. For use in the therapeutic treatment of damaged skin, compositions according to the invention may be formulated, for example, as a gel, jelly, ointment, or aqueous spray. An aqueous spray is particularly suitable for the treatment of large areas of damaged tissue, especially that damaged by burns, including cases where skin grafting is to be carried out. A gel or jelly is more suitable for the treatment of smaller areas of damaged tissue, especially that damaged by burns and an ointment is generally suitable for use where the skin has been lacerated. Compositions according to the invention intended for the treatment of burns may advantageously additionally comprise allantoin. Compositions in the form of a gel, jelly or ointment may suitably be formulated as described above Compositions in the form of an aqueous spray may comprise the allantoin formaldehyde condensation product, suitably in an amount of from 1 to 10 by weight, based on the total weight of the formulation in admixture or conjunction with physiologically tolerable saline solution. A composition formulated as an aqueous spray may suitably comprise from 1 to 10 by weight of imidazolidinyl urea and or diazolidinyl urea, from 0.1 to 3 by weight of a hydroxybenzoate, up to 5 by weight of water, and buffered normal saline to 1000 o by weight, all percentages being based on the total weight of the composition. The allantoin formaldehyde condensation products may also be used for the treatment of ear and eye infections in both humans and animals. Compositions according to the invention intended for this purpose may suitably be formulated as an ointment or as drops, advantageously containing the allantoin formaldehyde condensation products in an amount of from 1 to 10 by weight, based on the total weight of the composition.Such a composition in the form of an ointment may suitably comprise from 1 to 10 by weight of imidazolidinyl urea and or diazolidinyl urea from 0.1 to 2 by weight of a hydroxybenzoate up to 10 by weight of another antibacterial agent, for example sulphacetamide or chloramphenicol up to 5 by weight of a topical anaesthetic, for example lignocaine and up to 99 by weight of a carrier, for example from 50 to 65 by weight of a liquid paraffin and from 25 to 35 by weight of white soft paraffin. The allantoin formaldehyde condensation products may also be used in a mouthwash, for example, for use before and or after dental treatment. Compositions according to the invention formulated as a mouthwash may comprise the allantoin formaldehyde condensation products, advantageously in a concentration of from 1 to 20 by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, in conjunction with one or more auxiliaries selected from a sweetening agent, a flavouring agent, and a colouring agent.Such a composition may comprise from 2 to 15 by weight of imidazolidinyl urea and or diazolidinyl urea from 0.1 to 3 by weight of a hydroxy benzoate up to 0.5 by weight of a sweetening agent, for example sodium saccharin up to 5 by weight of a flavouring agent a colouring agent as required from 2 to 5 by weight of a thickening agent, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose up to 10 by weight of a polyhydric alcohol and water to 100 by weight all percentages being based on the total weight of the composition. Further examples of compositions according to the invention suitable for human use include compositions formulated as antimicrobial capsules for general systemic applications, compositions formulated as a gel or jelly for mouth ulcers and vaginal infections, and compositions formulated as a water based spray for foot treatment. A further example of a composition according to the invention is a composition for skin sterilisation comprising from 1 to 10 by weight of imidazolidinyl urea or diazolidinyl urea from 0.1 to 1 by weight of a hydroxybenzoate up to 10 by weight of a chlorhexidine salt from 10 to 75 by weight of an alcohol, for example methanol, ethanol or isopropanol up to 2 by weight of a surfactant, for example sodium lauryl sulphate a colouring agent as required up to 5 by weight of a thickening agent1 for example hydroxyethylcellulose, Carbopol, or sodium carboxymethylcellulose and water to 100 by weight all percentages being based on the total weight of the composition. The allantoin formaldehyde condensation products may be used in the treatment of fish, especially in fish tanks and fish farming.One drug previously used for the therapeutic treatment of fish is trimethoprim, but that substance is water insoluble and therefore has to be used by being incorporated in the fish feed. Sick fish do not, however, necessarily take the feed and that is not therefore a very satisfactory method of treatment method. Some drugs previously used for the treatment of fish are ineffective or insufficiently effective against Pseudomonas.Moreover, various water soluble materials that have previously been used for the treatment of fish in, for example, a treatment tank, are toxic and can present an environment hazard when water containing them is discharged as waste. According to the present invention fish may be treated by, for example, placing them in a treatment tank containing a solution of the allantoin formaldehyde condensation product. Compositions according to the invention suitable for the treatment of fish may be in the form of a fish feed, or may comprise a solution of the condensation product and a fish fungicide. The allantoin formaldehyde condensation products have a number of important advantages over substances previously used for the treatment of many of the infections and diseases mentioned. The combination of their low toxicity, low irritancy and wide range of antimicrobial acitivity is particularly important.Various non antibiotic chemotherapeutic substances already known have a wide range of antimicrobial acitivity, but have the disadvantage of a high irritancy and therefore cannot be used in certain applications and in relatively high concentrations and or have a relatively high toxicity, also preventing them from being used in relatively high concentrations.On the other hand, antibiotic substances have a low irritancy, but their action tends to be fairly specific and many pathogens exist in strains that are resistant to antibiotics, and antibiotic substances also have the disadvantage of having to be used in carefully controlled doses. The present condensation products thus combine the advantages of antibiotic substances with those of non antibiotic chemotherapeutic substances. They also have the advantages of being soluble in water, a high degree of safety in use, leaving little or no tissue residue, and having few or no side effects. When used, for example in solutions for treating contact lenses, they have the advantage that unlike known solutions containing quaternary ammonium salts, they are non irritant and when used, for example, in scrubbing up by surgeons, they have the advantage that, unlike some substances used for that purpose, they have a very low toxicity. The following examples illustrate the manufacture of compositions according to the invention formulated for various applications. All percentages given are calculated by weight and are based on the total weight of the composition, unless otherwise stated.Pressures given in the examples are gauge pressures.The term active substance as used in the examples, means imidazolidinyl urea or diazolidinyl urea Example 1 Gel for intramammary use on a lactating cow active substance 2.00 glycerine 25.00 methyl hydroxybenzoate 0.05 propyl hydroxybenzoate 0.05 sodium carboxymethylcellulose 4.50 water to 100.00 The methyl hydroxybenzoate and the propyl hydroxybenzoate are mixed with cold water and heated until dissolution occurs, and the solution is cooled and filtered. The active substance is dissolved in cold water and the solution is filtered. The two solutions are then mixed, together with further water, and stirred thoroughly.The pH is adjusted to about 6.3 using normal sodium hydroxide solution or 10 hydrochloric acid. The glycerine and sodium carboxymethylcellulose are mixed and stirred to form a smooth paste. The solution is then added to the paste, made up to final volume with water, and stirred thoroughly. A sample is then autoclaved at about 15 lb in2 about 1 bar for about 40 minutes and then its viscosity is checked. If the viscosity is not within the range of from 8000 to 15000 cP, an additional portion of sodium carboxymethylcellulose is added to a second sample, which is then autoclaved as before, after which its viscosity is checked as before. When an autoclaved sample of the correct viscosity has been obtained, any necessary adjustments are made to the remaining bulk, and that is then autoclaved for 40 minutes. The autoclaved product may then be filled into plastic syringes with, for example, a 10 g fill. The final product should preferably have a viscosity of about 3000 cP so that it can flow readily from the syringe.Example 2 Ointment for extramammary use on a dry cow active substance 8.0to aluminium stearate 65.0 liquid paraffin 20.0to Tween 80 t 5.iso methyl hydroxybenzoate 1.0S propyl hydroxybenzoate 1.ouzo The aluminium stearate, liquid paraffin and Tween 80 are mixed and heated at 1500C 0 for 1 hour and then allowed to cool to 35 40 C. The methyl hydroxybenzoate and propyl hydroxybenzoate are added to the resulting mixture, while being stirred, and the active substance is then added with further stirring, which is then continued for about 15 minutes after all ingredients have been added. The mixture is then passed through a colloid mill, and finally mixed with a high speed stirrer for about 30 minutes.Example 3 Bolus for enteric infections in large animals active substance 10.0 microcrystalline cellulose 10.4 starch 19.5 magnesium stearate 0.5 colour 0.5 lactose to 100.0 The bolus may be prepared by direct compression of a mixture of the components listed above, or the components may first be subjected to aqueous or nonaqueous granulation.Example 4 Capsules for enteric infections in small animals active substance 5.00to starch 94.65 stearic acid 0.35 The percentages given above in this example are based on the capsule contents. The active substance and the starch are blended in a drum blender, and the compacted under 2 a pressure of about 70 lb in2 about 4.75 bar on a roller compactor operated at slow speed. The resulting graunles are passed through a 1 mm mesh sieve, blended with the stearic acid, and then filled into gelatine shells. Alternatively, the mixture may be filled into the shells as a powder or after aqueous or non aqueous granulation. Example 5 Uterine infusion active substance 3.00 S methyl hydroxybenzoate 1.00 propyl hydroxybenzoate 1.000 , dye 0.05 water 5.00 buffered normal saline to lo0,000 o The methyl hydrpxybenzoate and propyl hydroxybenzoate are added to water heated to about 800C, and the mixture is stirred until a clear solution is formed. The active substance is dissolved in cold water and the dye is added to the resulting solution. The two solutions are then mixed together, stirred, and made up to final volume with the buffered normal saline. The pH is adjusted to between 6,0 and 6,5 by adding normal sodium hydroxide solution or 10 hydrochloric acid as necessary.

The glycerin and silicone fluid are added to the resulting emulsion and stirred until a homogeneous mixture has formed.ExamPle 9 Jelly for treatment of burns active substance 2.0 glycerine 25.0So methyl hydroxybenzoate 0.5 propyl hydroxybenzoate 0.5 sodium carboxymethylcellulose 4.5 lignocaine hydrochloride 2.0 water to 100.0 The methyl hydroxybenzoate and propyl hydroxybenzoate are added, with stirring, to a portion of the water heated to boiling. When a clear solution has been formed, it is cooled and filtered. The glycerine is stirred at high speed while the sodium carboxymethylcellulose is added thereto, and stirring is continued until a smooth paste has been formed. The active substance and lignocaine hydrochloride are stirred in cold water until they have dissolved and the resulting solution is filtered. The two aqueous solutions are mixed together and most of the remaining water required is added thereto. The pH is checked and adjusted as necessary to about 6.3 by adding normal sodium hydroxide solution or 109 0 hydrochloric acid. The solution is then added to the glycerine paste and adjusted to volume with further water. It is then stirred, initially slowly and then at high speed, for about 20 minutes. A sample is then autoclaved, the viscosity is checked and adjusted, and the bulk is autoclaved, as described in Example 1.Example 10 Aqueous spray for treatment of burns and skin grafts active substance 2.0 methyl hydroxybenzoate 0.5 propyl hydroxybenzoate 0.5 water 5.0 buffered normal saline to 100.0 A portion of the water is boiled and allowed to cool to 800C, and the methyl hydroxybenzoate and propyl hydroxybenzoate are added thereto and stirred until dissolved.

The pH is adjusted as necessary to between 6.0 and 6.5 by adding normal sodium hydroxide solution or 10 hydrochloric acid. The solution is then filled into spray packs using, for example, Arctons as a propellant or, if the solution and the propellant are kept separate by means of a plastics membrane, using nitrogen or carbon dioxide, for example, as the propellant.Example 11 Skin ointment for treatment of lacerations in humans and animals active substance 2.0 methyl hydroxybenzoate 0.5 propyl hydroxybenzoate 0.5 prednisolone 0.3 cod liver oil 10.00 chlorophyll 2.0 polyethylene glycol 4000 40.00 propylene glycol 45.OYo neoroli oil up to 2.00 0 abietis oil up to 2.00 0 The prednisolone and half the polypropylene glycol are stirred together until the former has dissolved in the latter, and then the polyethylene glycol is added thereto, with stirring and gentle heating to a temperature not exceeding 550C The remainder of the polypropylene glycol is then added to the mixture, followed by the cod liver oil and then by the methyl hydroxybenzoate, propyl hydroxybenzoate and chlorophyll, with continuous stirring. The neoroli oil and abietis oil are then added, and the mixture is allowed to cool, with intermittent stirring until the bulk begins to thicken and set.Example 12 Mouthwash active substance 10.0 methyl hydroxybenzoate 0.5 propyl hydroxybenzoate 0.5 sodium saccharin 0.04 flavouring 0.5 dye 0.01 sodium carboxymethylcellulose 2.7 water to 1OO.Ob o A portion of water is heated to boiling and allowed to cool slightly, and then the methyl hydroxybenzoate and propyl hydroxybenzoate are added thereto1 with stirring until a clear solution has formed. The dye, flavouring and saccharin are dissolved or well dispersed in a further portion of water. The active substance is dissolved in a third portion of water. The sodium carboxymethylcellulose is slowly added to a fourth portion of water stirred at high speed, and stirring is continued for about 15 minutes, until a fairly viscous gel has formed. The benzoate solution is then added to the gel, with stirring, followed by addition of the dye solution and then the active substance solution. Water is added to final volume, and stirring is continued for about 20 minutes.
