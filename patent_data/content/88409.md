# Process for preparing 2 keto L gulonic acid.

## Abstract
2 keto L gulonic acid is prepared directly from D glucose by microbial conversion utilizing mixed culturing on a medium containing D glucose, employing two types of microorgan isms the first, a 2,5 diketo D gluconic acid producing micro organism which belongs to the genus Erwinia and the second, a 2 keto L gulonic acid producing microorganism which be longs to the genus Brevibacterium or Corynebacterium. The incubation of the microorganisms in a medium containing D glucose is used in the disclosed process. By production of 2 keto D gluconic acid, the undesired isomer of the intended product, is effectively prevented by employing the mixed cul turing because of the co existence of the both microorgan isms in the medium during at least part of the entire cultivation. Namely, 2 keto D gluconic acid produced by the second micro organism is utilized by the first microorganism to produce 2,5 diketo D gluconic acid which is subsequently converted into 2 keto L gulonic acid by the second microorganism.
