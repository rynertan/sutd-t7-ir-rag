# Piezoelectric motor.

## Abstract
A piezoelectric motor or a piezoelectric linear motor comprises a stator 44 having two piezoelectric vibrating members 38, 39 and a substrate 40 which is made of an acoustic substance and has vibration transmitting member 41 , and sliders 55, 56 which contact a vibration transmit ting member 41 formed on said stator 44 at parts of maximum displacement of the stator 44 .
