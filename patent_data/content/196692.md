## Abstract
A holder for receiving cards with electronically stored data or printed circuit boards. The holder has guide means to receive the card. The holder is provided with a connector with contact springs for contacting connection strips located on the card. One end of each contact spring is clamped while the other is free to move and make contact with the connection strips. The contact springs include the parts formed by bending and shaped so as to minimize pressure and friction against the connection strips of the card.
