# CONTOURING METHOD AND MACHINE FOR PRINTED CIRCUITS

## Abstract
The contouring is effected by firstly cutting partially the contour, so as to leave a portion of the contour enough long to ensure the rigidity of the circuit with respect to the board 8. Then the circuit is clamped, while the remaining portion is cut without any discontinuity in the cutting. The contouring machine comprises an operating head 21 and a workpiece pressing device 23, 46, 47, 51, which is operated for clamping the circuit during the cutting of the remaining portion of the contour. This device comprises a pad 51 movable with respect to the head 21 parallely to said portion of the contour for a displacement at least equal to the length of the portion. The pad 51 is then returned to rest during the raising of the head 21 by engaging with a roller 53 a stationary taper edge 54.
