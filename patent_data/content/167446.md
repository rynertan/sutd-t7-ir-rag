## Description
This invention relates to a substrate and a layer of semiconductor material thereon and a method for making the combination. In certain usages, the need for making inexpensively semiconductor devices and systems using these devices is greater than the need for production methods giving the highest quality of semiconductor devices. For example, certain switches can be made from majority carrier semiconductor devices, on material which has more impurities and defects than is tolerable in the best minority carrier devices. That is, as is well known, a minority carrier device requires injection of carriers, e.g., electrons in p type material, above the equilibrium amount where they would normally not be. If defects are present in sufficient amounts, these injected minority carriers do not survive. However, in majority carrier devices, injection of carriers above equilibrium amounts is not used, so that the presence or absence of defects is of much less importance. The majority carrier devices are attractive, however, only if they can be made at reduced cost. One approach in manufacturing semiconductor devices is to vapor deposit polysilicon onto a substrate and convert the polysilicon into recrystallized silicon. Such an approach, however, requires deposition temperatures of about 1400 C. For the process to be inexpensive, and therefore useful in making inexpensive majority carrier devices, the substrate must be able to withstand such high temperatures while at the same time itself be selected from inexpensive materials. Because high temperature resistance generally requires the substrate to comprise less conventional, expensive materials, a dilemma has existed in attempts to use such inexpensive substrates. For example, high temperature resistance generally requires the use of refractory materials, such as quartz, ceramics or specialized glass, and such materials do not lend themselves to inexpensive manufacturing. What has been known prior to this invention was the use of a substrate comprising an organic polymer layer and metal layer, but only to manufacture a mirror, as taught in U.S. Patent No. 4,028,206. Such substrates are subjected to a much lower processing temperature 500 C to produce a heat flux less than 10 watts cm², a flux that is about 1 20 that encountered by substrates used to process semiconductor material to make semiconductor devices. In FR A 2536912 it is disclosed to provide a recrystallized metal or semiconductor layer on an organic polymer substrate prior to growing an epitaxial semiconductor thereon. In Transactions of the I.E.C.E. of Japan, Vol. E66 No. 1, p.34 38, a p i n solar cell is proposed, formed on a sputtered stainless steel film deposited on a polymer substrate. Therefore, the problem of the invention has been to provide an inexpensive substrate such as one comprising an organic polymer, for use with semiconductor devices requiring processing at or above the noted temperature. Such a substrate has not been thought to be operable under such temperatures, since the organic polymer normally cannot tolerate such heat. Metal electrodes, although described heretofore as being sandwiched between various substrates and semiconductor layers, have not been part of the substrate itself. The problem of the invention is solved by an inexpensive substrate having thereon a layer of semiconductor material and comprising in the following order, a layer of organic polymer, a layer of metal or metal alloy, and a layer of dielectric material. The layers of dielectric material and metal or metal alloy together have a thickness sufficient to dissipate the heat that occurs when the semiconductor material is heated to 1000 C, for less than 1 second without causing significant decomposition or thermal expansion of the polymer layer. The dielectric material layer isolates the metal or metal alloy layer from the semiconductor layer. Thus, this invention advantageously features an inexpensive substrate for a semiconductor device, which substrate nevertheless is capable of withstanding the high temperatures used to prepare such devices. An additional advantageous feature of the invention is that there is provided a novel method of heating a semiconductor material to temperatures of at least 1000 C, using an inexpensive substrate. The present invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the attached drawing, in which The substrate of the invention is particularly preferred in making majority carrier semiconductor devices wherein the high temperatures used to process the semiconductor material arise locally for a limited duration of time because of a recrystallization of polysilicon to single crystal silicon, or to polycrystalline silicon of very large grain size, for example 1 to 100 µm. In addition, the substrate of this invention is particularly useful in making semiconductor devices of any type using non silicon materials, which involve heating the semiconductor material to a temperature of at least 1000 C for any reason, and not just for recrystallization. As used herein, processing of the semiconductor material refers to any step in the making of devices from the material, such as annealing, doping, bonding, and the like, requiring heating. That is, although the substrate is preferably intended to permit total recrystallization of polysilicon at a temperature of 1400 C, the substrate also permits processing at temperatures at or above 1000 C, for example to enlarge the polysilicon grains or to grow thermal oxide. As is well known, larger grains produced from smaller grains are beneficial because enhanced mobility arising from fewer boundary traps produces better performance of the semiconductor devices. As used herein, large grain polysilicon means those grains dimensioned from 2 to 100 µm. The substrate is constructed with a layer of organic polymer, preferably as the bottommost layer. Then, in the following order, the substrate additionally comprises a layer of metal or metal alloy selected as described hereinafter, and a layer of dielectric material. The exposed surface of the dielectric material remote from the surface contacting the metal layer is then used to receive the semiconductor material. The dielectric material is present to electrically and chemically isolate the semiconductor material from the metal layer. This in turn prevents the metal layer from poisoning the semiconductor material formed on the substrate. In the absence of the dielectric material, metal atoms in significant quantity would undesirably diffuse into the semiconductor material upon heating to 1000 C or higher. It will be appreciated that the construction of the semiconductor device by converting polysilicon into single crystalline silicon or polysilicon with larger grains, involves localized high temperature heating only for short durations, i.e., less than 1 second. Useful examples include a limited duration of from 10 ⁹ to 10 ² sec, applied to an area of from 1 to 10⁵ µm². Many organic polymers are useful in forming the substrate of the invention. The polymer can be self supporting, or it can be cast on the metal layer. Preferred are those having maximized heat resistance as hereinafter explained. In addition polymers having reduced heat resistance, including certain polyesters, e.g., poly ethylene terephthalate , are also useful. In the latter case, if the Tg of the polymer is less than 200 C, the thicknesses of the dielectric layer and of the metal layer are adjusted as described in detail hereafter, so that the polymer will not decompose or significantly thermally expand when the semiconductor device is processed on the substrate at temperatures as high as 1000 to 1400 C. As used herein, significant thermal expansion means no greater than about 1 . In the case of a polymer having very low thermal resistance, it is most preferred that copper, silver or aluminum be selected as the metal, to assist in conducting the heat away from the polymer before thermal damage occurs to the polymer. Failure to conduct such heat away leads to melting or disintegration of the polymer, and a failure in the support provided to the device by the substrate. As noted above, the most preferred polymers are those having maximized heat resistance, that is those having a Tg of at least 200 C. Thus, polyimides such as those available under the trademark KAPTAN from DuPont are useful. Particularly preferred are polymers comprising from 5 to 65 mole percent recurring units derived from dicarboxylic acids, organic diols and their derivatives, such that the polymer has a Tg of at least 200 C. Useful examples of such derivatives include the corresponding acids, acid chlorides, esters and anhydrides. Particularly useful examples are described as items A through M on page 290 of With respect to the metal layer contacting the layer of organic polymer, any elemental metal, or an alloy thereof, is useful to form such layer. Metal is understood to mean the elements listed as such in Thermal Conductivity of Metallic Elements and Alloys , Vol. 1, The metal layer is considered to be essential to the practice of this invention as, without it, the polymers described above tend to deteriorate or be vaporized under the heating conditions described. After formation of the metal layer, a layer of dielectric material is formed. Any dielectric is useful, wherein dielectric means those materials having low electrical and thermal conductivity. Most preferred is silicon dioxide, but others such as silicon nitride, sapphire and Al₂O₃ are also useful. Useful thicknesses for the polymer layer, the metal layer and the dielectric layer include those between 1 and 1000 µm. The thickness of the polymer layer is selected to provide adequate support for the semiconductor device. Thicknesses as large as 1 cm are also useful for the polymer layer. If the Tg of the polymer is below 200 C, the thicknesses of the dielectric layer and of the metal layer are at the high end of the noted ranges to prevent thermal damage to the polymer layer, as noted. As shown in the Figure, the semiconductor device 10 comprises single crystalline silicon or large grain polysilicon 20 formed on substrate 30. The substrate in turn comprises, from the bottom up, a layer 32 of the organic polymer, a layer 34 of the metal or metallic alloy, and a layer 36 of the dielectric material. The actual electrical components of device 10 are omitted for clarity. The organic polymer described above is preferably deposited as a layer out of a solution, or extruded or pressed, and the solvent evaporated. Thereafter, the metal layer is vapor deposited, sputtered, or otherwise formed at low temperatures onto the layer of organic polymer. Alternatively, the polymer can be coated onto the metal layer. Following these steps, a layer of silicon dioxide is formed on the metal, such as by reactive evaporation at 10 ⁴ torr 10 ² N m² oxygen pressure, and the substrate is ready for device fabrication. Device fabrication proceeds by a variety of conventional steps. Most preferred are those that include the process of depositing polysilicon onto the layer of silicon dioxide, such as by crown evaporation, and thereafter recrystallizing the polysilicon into single crystal silicon, such as by laser exposure. Melt recrystallization occurs at temperatures of 1400 C or higher. Alternatively, as noted, some improvement in the grain size of the material may occur at lower temperatures e.g., 1000 C . Further steps in the making of a device, such as doping, ion implanting, diffusing, etching, and electrode forming, are all conventional and require no further elaboration. The following example further illustrates the invention. A 10 µm thick layer of a homopolymer of 4,4 hexahydro 4,7 methanoindan 5 ylidene diphenylene terephthalate was coated by vacuum deposition with a 2 µm thick layer of tin. A 2 µm layer of SiO₂ was then deposited onto the polycrystalline tin by reactive evaporation of SiO₂ using a vacuum of 10 ² N m² oxygen. A final coating of 400nm 4000 A of polysilicon was deposited onto the substrate so formed. When the polysilicon was heated by a cw laser having a dwell time of 1 to 1000 cm per sec, with a beam diameter of 10 to 1000 µm, the grain size was increased markedly to about 5 to 20 µm and the substrate remained undamaged.
