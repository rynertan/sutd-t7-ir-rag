# METHOD FOR STABILIZING THE ENZYMIC ACTIVITY OF PHENYLALANINE AMMONIA LYASE DURING L PHENYLALANINE PRODUCTION

## Abstract
A method for the enzymatic conversion of t cinnamic acid and ammonia to L phenylalanine, using the catalyst, phenyl alanine ammonia lyase, wherein the stability and useful life of the enzyme are improved by conducting the conversion under substantially anaerobic, static conditions.
