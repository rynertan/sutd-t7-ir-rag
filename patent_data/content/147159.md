# COMPLEMENTARY FIELD EFFECT TRANSISTOR EXCLUSIVE OR OR NOR LOGIC GATES

## Abstract
A complementary MOS static EXCLUSIVE OR gate is formed by a PMOS logic network having a pair of cross coupled PMOS transistors M5, M6 and an NMOS logic network having two parallel branches, each of the branches containing a separate pair M1, M2 and M3, M4 of NMOS transistors connected in series. The arrangement prevents coupling or conflict of the signal
