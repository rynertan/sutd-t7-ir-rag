# Magnetic tape cassette.

## Abstract
In a magnetic tape cassette comprising a housing hav ing two rectangular major walls 3, 8 , two long side walls and two short side walls, the hubs 13, 14 of two reels 15, 16 are mounted for rotation in the major walls. A first long side wall is formed with apertures part which a length of magnetic tape 26 which is unwound from and taken up by the reel hubs is guided by means of a pair of tape guides 28, 29 38, 39 48 which are arranged at or near corners of the cassette and around which the magnetic tape passes in contact with the guides. The reel hubs 13, 14 are journalled in the major walls, without radial play, the hubs each being provided with flanges 21, 22 near the two ends of the hub, which flanges each have a diameter such that starting from the circumference of each reel hub, the flanges support at least some of the turns of tape on the hub in the axial direction. Each pair of tape guides is provided with two height guides 30, 31 46 for supporting the edges of the tape in directions parallel to the axes of the reel hubs and the two height guides of each tape guide, converge near that side of the tape guide which faces the first long side wall, the two height guides guiding the tape edges at least at the area of contact between the tape and the respective guide, during operation a tangent plane 37 to the end portion 35 of a height guide 30 31 46 substantially coincides with a tangent plane to the inner side of the flange 21 of a reel hub 13 14 .
