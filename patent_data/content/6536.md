# Piperidine spiro hydantoin derivatives and their use as light stabilizers for synthetic polymers.

## Abstract
Novel piperidine spiro hydantoin derivatives repre sented by the general formula I and use thereof as light stabilizers for synthetic polymers are described The compounds are distinguished by an improved stabilizing effect in various synthetic polymer composi tions, such as polyolefins against light and or heat induced deterioration thereof, low volatility upon heat processing or during storage of shaped articles containing the compounds, and resistance to extraction with water and solvents.
