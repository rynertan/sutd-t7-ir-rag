# Continuously variable transmission with synchronous shift.

## Abstract
A continuously variable transmission 10 with synchro nous shift includes an input 14 , an output 60 , a fixed ratio drive mechanism 20 and a variator 28 in driven relation ship with the input, a planetary gear assembly 36 having a sun gear, a ring gear, a carrier, and a plurality of planet gears, a first clutch A for engaging the variator selectively with the sun and ring gears, a second clutch B for engaging the mechanism selectively with the carrier and sun gear and for disengaging the mechanism therefrom, and a third clutch C for engaging the ring gear and carrier selectively with the output. This relationship provides the transmission with a plurality of drive ranges and the capability of shifting from any range to any other range at a synchronous shift point established when the variator ratio is equal to the ratio of the mechanism.
