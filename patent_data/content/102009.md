# Combined tractor and friction web feed mechanism.

## Abstract
High performance tractor apparatus having one or more of the following features selectable tractor feed or friction feed of the web where the tractor and friction feed modes are carried out in non interfering relationship and with precision line registration in either mode a latch down lid 26 which is movable between closed position over the tractor belt 70 and open position for threading of the web with one hand without sacrificing the hold down force exerted by the latch 102 when the lid 26 is in closed position hinging of the lid 26 from the frame 12 without any parts other than the frame 12 and lid 26 themselves which can be latched together to provide an unitary assembly and tensioning of the belt 70 with a shoe 120 which is spring biased but fixed in position upon assembly of the tractor to apply predetermined tensioning to the belt 70 which may be reestablished from time to time by releasing and then reapplying the clamping force which holds the frame 12 together and fixes the position of the shoe 120 in the frame 12 .
