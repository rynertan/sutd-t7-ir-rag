# Zirconium oxide powder containing cerium oxide and yttrium oxide.

## Abstract
A flame spray material for producing a low thermal conductivity ceramic coating is comprised of a homoge neous ceramic composition formed of zirconium oxide, cerium oxide and yttrium oxide. The composition is prefer ably in the form of composite particles each of which con tains a plurality of subparticles of each of the oxide con stituents bonded with an organic binder.
