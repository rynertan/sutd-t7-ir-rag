## Description
ASSAY FOR DRUGS OF ABUSE FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to the detection and semi quantitative determination of drugs of abuse. The particular drug, e.g., morphine, cocaine, amphetamine, etc., or a metabolite thereof, is detected by contacting the body fluid, e.g., urine, with an immunologicallyspecific dipstick which has an indicator pad and a reference pad. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Many procedures, techniques and reagents have been reported for the detection of particular ligands in body fluids. Among the important application of the principles involved in the detection of ligands is the detection of drugs of abuse for both medical and legal reasons. Ligands which have been detected using what may be broadly described as immunochemical techniques include various drugs which have a variety of physiological effects.Such drugs include narcotics, hypnotics, sedatives, analgesics, antipyretics, anesthetics, psychotogenic drugs, muscle relaxants, nervous system stimulants, anticholinesterase agents, parasympathomimetic agents, sympathomimetic agents, neuromuscular agents, histamines, antihistamines, cardiovascular drugs, antiarrhythmic drugs, antihypertensive agents, vasodilator drugs, diuretics, antibiotics, hormones, vitamins, tumor cells, bacterial and viral proteins, toxins, blood proteins and their metabolites. Included in the drugs which are of particular interest are alkaloids, steroids, polypeptides and proteins. Ligands may be quite small, e.g., low molecular weight organic compounds, or very large, having molecular weight as high as 100,000 or more. Ligands of interest in the present assay include antigens and, very importantly, haptens. Haptens are substances which, upon being injected as simple chemicals, do not give rise to antibodies. However, antibodies can be raised against haptens when they are conjugated to antigenic carriers prior to using them for immunization.

Of general interest, as related to enzymelinked immunoassay methods, is U.S. Patent No. 3,654,090,Schuurs and VanWeemen, April 4, 1972. There are a great many kits and test strips which involve the enzyme linked immunoassay principle.The most pertinent disclosure, as related to the present invention, which is known to the inventors is that ofLitman, et al., An Internally Referenced Test Strip Immunoassay for Morphine , Clinical Chemistry, Volume 29,No. 9, Pages 1598 1603 1983 . The Litman, et al.internally referenced test strip is described as being composed of two active surfaces, each of which contains co immobilized glucose oxidase and antibody. The indicator pad contains antibody directed against the drug, and the color that develops on its surface is inhibited by the presence of the drug in the sample. The reference pad contains anti peroxidase and is used to set the assay detection limit, and normalize for variants in temperature, timing, and sample interference. By adjusting the anti peroxidase loading, the color that is produced on the reference pad can be made equal to that produced on the indicator pad when the analyte concentration is equal to the detection limit of the assay This test strip is described with particular applicability to the detection of morphine. While the Litman, et al. internally referenced test strip has some apparent advantages, it would suffer from a significant disadvantage in that it would be extremely difficult, nearly impossible in production environments, to provide consistent anti peroxidase loading on the reference pad. This requires very tight quality control and inevitably would result in a great deal of rejected product. The present invention also provides an internally referenced pad, but overcomes the difficulties presented in the Litman, et al. internally referenced test strip. The present invention utilizes the enzyme linked immunoassay techniques which are generally described in the cited prior art and a large volume of published literature and patents, and is distinguished from the prior art in that the problem of controlling the loading of the reference pad has been overcome by the apparatus, methods and techniques described hereinafter. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to apparatus for use in determining the presence of a ligand. The apparatus comprises a reference solid support area comprising a first component of a reference coupling pair which is capable of coupling with a second component of a reference coupling pair. The second component of the reference coupling pair is labeled with a moiety which can be detected and measured. This second component is referred to as the reference conjugate. A test solid support area is also included in the apparatus, the test area comprising a receptor of an immunochemically binding pair. The other component of the immunochemically binding pair comprises the ligand to be determined, i.e., the test ligand.The receptor is capable of immunochemically binding the test ligand and an immunochemically identical ligand labeled with same moiety used to label the reference conjugate. In a preferred form, the reference coupling pair comprises avidin and biotin, and the immunochemically binding pair comprises a pair selected from the group of pairs consisting of a an antigen and an antibody to said antigen, b a hapten and an antibody to said hapten, and c a protein and an antibody to the protein. The process of this invention comprises the steps of inserting a test apparatus, which comprises the reference and test solid support areas described above, into a test solution suspected of containing the test ligand, e.g., morphine. Reference conjugate and ligand conjugate of the immunochemically binding pair in known quantities are added to the test solution. The test solution and the apparatus are incubated or otherwise allowed to react for a sufficient period of time to effect immunochemical binding reactions and chemical binding reactions between, respectively, the immunochemically coupling pair and the reference coupling pair. The reference area, after the above reaction, contains reference conjugate from the test solution. The test area contains test ligand and ligand conjugate.The test ligands and labelled ligands on the test area are proportional to the amounts of test ligand and ligand conjugate in the test solution. The test apparatus is removed, washed if necessary, and the labeling moiety is developed, if necessary, and detected. Any signal developed, e.g., a colored entity, must remain where it is generated and not dissolve or diffuse away i.e., there must be some affinity between the colored entity and the solid support. In the preferred form of the invention, the label is an enzyme which, upon being developed, produces a distinctive color which remains where it is developed. Radiolabels or fluorescent labels, on moieties which are stable where produced, may, however, be used.In the preferred form in which an enzyme label is used, the color on the test area is compared with the color on the reference area to give a semi quantitative measure of the amount of test ligand present in the test solution. In a particularly preferred form, the invention comprises a test strip or stick which has thereon two areas, referred to for convenience as pads, a reference pad, and a test pad. The reference pad consists essentially of one component of a reference coupling pair, such as avidin. The test pad consists essentially of an immobilized receptor for the test ligand. In another preferred form, the test stick comprises a single reference pad and indicator pads for detecting two different test ligands. In a preferred form of the process of the invention, the test apparatus in the form of a strip or stick is allowed to react with a solution suspected of containing the test ligand, to which is added known concentrations of the reference conjugate and of the ligand of interest to which the same enzyme used in the reference conjugate has been conjugated, i.e., the ligand conjugate. The known amount of ligand conjugate competes for sites on the test pad with the test ligand, while the reference conjugate independently reacts with first component of the reference couple on the reference pad without interference by the test ligand. To the extent reaction times, temperatures, concentrations, interfering constituents and other variables affect the assay, the effect is substantially the same for both the ligand conjugate and the reference conjugate.The enzyme is developed to produce the characteristic color. The color on the reference pad is the standard and is a function of the available reference conjugate. The color of the test pad is a function of the portion of the available sites on the test pad occupied by ligand conjugate and inversely proportional to the amount of test ligand in the sample. The present invention obviates one of the major difficulties faced in earlier systems using a reference pad. In earlier assays, it was necessary to control with great precision the amount of antibody, or other immunochemical receptor, on the reference pad In production, this is an almost impossible, and certainly impractical, procedure which would certainly result in a high proportion of rejected product. According to the present invention, it is not necessary to maintain such high precision in the manufacture of the test stick or strip.Control is imposed in the amount of reference conjugate, and ligand conjugate, added to the test solution. It is a very easy matter to fine tune the addition of these materials to the test solution. Quantities are easily controlled and great precision is readily attainable. The invention, in one of its more preferred forms, is a kit suitable for use in testing for the presence of test ligand in body fluids, e.g., testing for morphine in urine. The kit comprises test apparatus as described above, along with ligand conjugate and reference conjugate at predetermined concentrations. The kit may also include vessels and other apparatus for carrying out the test. It is within the scope of this invention to include more than one reference pad and or more than one test pad in the same apparatus.

Figure 6 is an alternative form of the invention, having one reference and two test pads. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION DEFINITIONS The following terms used herein are defined at this point for convenience Ligand. The term ligand is used here in the immunochemical sense and includes the components of any pair which binds together through or as the result of immunochemically determinant structures. Ligands include hapten antibody and antigen antibody pairs, and both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. The term antigen in this definition is used broadly to include any substance which induces an antibody reaction in animals. Receptor. A receptor, as used here, means a substance which will immunochemically bind a ligand, with particular reference to the ligand to be determined, and typically will be the antibody to the hapten or the antigen. Reference coupling pair. Reference coupling pair or reference couple refers to a pair of compounds which have specific affinity for each other. The affinity may be chemical or immunochemical. Typical of coupling pairs are Avidin and biotin hapten and antibody to the hapten polyanion and cation or, polycation and anion. Reference conjugate. Reference conjugates are formed by conjugating one member of the reference couple with a labeling moiety, e.g., a labeling enzyme. Ligand conjugate. Ligand conjugates are formed by conjugating ligands of the immunochemical type to be determined with a labeling moiety. L IGANDS Ligands of interest with respect to this invention include any ligand which may be found in body fluids or tissue which is soluble in or can be solubilized in a test solution. Among the ligands of particular interest are the drugs of abuse. Drugs of abuse include a wide spectrum of drugs having a variety of physiological reactions when ingested or injected. Among the most common of these drugs of abuse are drugs which act as narcotics, hypnotics, sedatives, psychotogenic drugs, muscle relaxants, and nervous system stimulants. Particularly important drugs of abuse to which this invention is applicable, include opiates such as morphine, cocaine, amphetamines, barbiturates, phencyclidine, tetrahydrocannibinol THC , methadone, Valium oxazepam , and their metabolites. Opiakes which can be detected according to the principle of this invention include morphine, heroin, hydromorphone, oxymorphone, metopon, codeine, hydrocodone, dihydrocodeine, dihydrohydroxycodeinone, pholocodine, dextromethorphan, phenaxocine and dionin. Catacholamines, and the related compounds epinephrine, amphetamines, and other related compounds are also subject to determination by the apparatus and methods of this invention. Barbiturates such as veronal, medinal, luminal, prominal, soneryl, nembutal, amytal, dial, phenadorn, seconal, evipan, phenobarbital and pentothal may be detected according to the principles of the present invention. Cocaine, a drug now being very widely abused, and its analogs, and marijuana, also widely abused, may be detected by the present invention. Tranquilizers such as meprobamate, and the benzdiazocycloheptanes are also abused and are subject to detection according to this invention. Amino acids, peptides and polypeptides are also subject to detection according to this invention, as are other antigenic substances and organisms to which a specific monoclonal antibody can be produced. Other substances which are subject to detection by the present invention include antibiotics such as penicillin, chloromycetin, actinomyucetin, tetracycline, terramycin, nucleic acids or drivatives, such as nucleosides and nuelectidest steroids, hormones, insecticides, fungicides, bacteriocides and nematocides. ENZYMES A wide variety of labeling enzymes that can be used in homogeneous type EIA e.g. Syva s Emit System have been reported in the literature. Typical of such enzymes are the oxidoreductases and hydrolases. The criteria for selecting those enzymes is well known, and has been discussed at some length by Rubenstein andUllman, U.S. Patent No. 4,067,774. The criteria for selecting an enzyme for use in the present invention are quite different, however, than the criteria discussed byRubenstein and Ullman. First, the enzyme ligand conjugate should not be grossly inhibited upon binding by the antibody. This is also true of the reference conjugate.Second, the colored product generated by the enzyme must bind to the solid support used in the present invention.Particular enzymes suitable for use as labels in the present invention include horseradish peroxidase HRP , beta galactasidase, acid phosphatase and alkaline phosphatase ALP , which is used as exemplary of the many available enzymes. OTHER LABELS Radioactive labels, a number of which are well known and generally used in the art, fluorescent labels and catalytic labels may be used. However, the preferred class of labels are the enzymes, as discussed, because of the simple and safe manner in which they can be employed without the need of ialized instrumentation or particular safety plecautieens, CIRCUMSTANCE KALtENG, TO THE INVENTION In enzyme immunoassays that utilize solid substrata, be it sandwich type or competitive type enzyme immunoassay, it is usually possible to find enzyme substrates that will form colored insoluble products that bind strongly to the solid matrix.For example, 5 Bromo 4 chloro 3 indolyl phosphate, a substrate for alkaline phosphatase ALP , forms a blue indigoid dye, which binds strongly or deposits itself, if you wish to paper. Paper cellulose and other hydrogen bond forming solid matrices e.g. nylon are usually good choices for this purpose. This property can be utilized to conveniently terminate an assay by just removing the solid matrix from the substrate solution and subsequently blotting it to dryness, resulting in quenched enzyme activity and a display of the end point color.Furthermore, it is now possible to do internal referencing. One can place in the sample solution, together with the first solid matrix, a second one on which is immobilized an appropriate amount of a suitable substance, and be able to determine the relative concentration of the analyte in question by comparing the color displayed on the first solid matrix to that on the second one, which wiS always correspond to a certain pre set analyte concentration, regardless of what the samples may be. Thus, the is no need to run standards along with samples external referencing . In fact, internal referencing should be superior to external referencing in most cases. This is because i sample matrices especially urine samples vary to a great extent, which may affect both enzyme activity and the nonspecific stickiness of the enzyme conjugates to the solid matrix ii variations in sample incubation time, washing technique and substrate incubation time. An example of internal referencing, relating to a competitive type enzyme immunoassay is a dipstick assay for morphine described by Litman, et awl., ClinicalChemistry, 29, 1598 1603 1983 . This dipstick also has two pads The indicator pad contains immobilized antibody against morphine, whereas the reference pad contains antibody against horseradish peroxidase HRP . The dipstick is first placed in a urine sample and then in a developer solution containing HRP morphine conjugate. The system is so designed that the reference pad will display color corresponding to about 300 ng ml morphine, and, therefore, a less intense blue color displayed on the indicator pad indicates the presence of more than 300 ng ml of morphine. The idea of using anti HEP on the reference pad in the above example is fine, except that it is usually a very painstaking task to control or fine tune the amount of antibody immobilized on the reference pad so that it will display color corresponding to a certain pre set analyte concentration. This is especially true in manufacturing a product like this. In the first place, one can never be sure that a large scale production run will yield precisely the same product as in a small scale trial run. If it turns out that the reference pad does not match the indicator pad, the whole lot of reagent paper for the reference pad has to be either discarded or put aside for a second round of matching with a different lot of indicator pad.Secondly, as a corollary of the above, it can never be guaranteed that the same lot of reference pad will match more than one lot of indicator pad and enzyme conjugate. This necessitates small trial runs before each production run. According to this invention, a system to confer both elegant precision in fine tuning the color on the reference pad to correspond to the desired analyte concentration and great ease and flexibility in the manufacturing process has been devised. DETAILED DESCRIPTION AND SPECIFIC EXAMPLESThe invention involYeS mainly the concept of reference conjugates. A reference conjugate is, in the preferred form, an enzyme that has been chemically modified to contain one or more covalently bonded groups of identical chemical structure which does not exist on the original enzyme molecule and bears no resemblance to the substance being analyzed, and will be bound by a binder substance immobilized on a solid substratum, the reference area or pads, that specifically recognizes and binds the group.By simply adjusting the concentration of this reference conjugate, one can fine tune the color on the reference area or pad very precisely and with great ease to that corresponding to the desired level of analyte concentration. This reference is totally independent of the analyte in sample because of the complete lack of affinity of the binder substance for the analyte, and, therefore, can be used as an internal reference. A table ot some representative groups and corresponding binder substances that can be used in this system is shown below. TABLE IBinding Group in Reference Binder Substance on Solid Conjugate Substratum biotinyl avidin hapten monoclonal anti hapten polyanion polycation cation anion Compounds belonging to the hapten category are vast and potentially most useful. One can almost select any structure that one desires and raise monoclonal antibodies against it. The following are three examples pertaining to the use of reference enzyme. EXAMPLE A I. Reagents i Enzyme conjugate cocktail contains 40 nM ALP morphine conjugate and 7 nM ALP biotin conjugate the reference conjugate in conjugate buffer. ii Dipstick the reference pad 3 16 x 1 8 is attached to one end of a plastic handle 3 16 x 2 1 2 and the indicator pad 3 16 x 1 8 is placed next to it. The reference pad contains avidin immobilized on paper. The indicator pad contains rabbit anti morphine immobilized on paper. iii Developer Solution 5mM 5 Bromo 4 chloro 3 indolyl phosphate in 0.3M AMP buffer at pH 10.15 with 0.02 NaN3 . II. Assay Procedure i Pipette 400 1 of sample into a 10 x 50 mm glass tube. ii Add 100 1 of enzyme conjugate cocktail. Vortex. iii Place dipstick in solution and incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature. iv Remove dipstick. Wash for 20 seconds uhder tap water. v Place dipstick in developer solution and incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature. vi Remove dipstick and blot on a clean paper towel. vii Blue color is quantitated by reading the pads on a MacBeth reflectance photometer. Figure 1 shows the responses of both the indicator and the reference pad to samples containing different concentrations of morphine. The quantity K S plotted on the Y axis is related to reflectance R by the equation K S l R 2 2R, and is linearly proportional to the amount of the blue dye deposited on the pads. One can see that the amount of the blue dye on the indicator pad decreases with increasing morphine concentration, whereas that on the reference pad remains constant at a level corresponding to 75 ng ml morphine. Therefore, without even running morphine standards, one can determine if the morphine concentration in the sample is greater or less than 75 ng ml by just comparing the colors on the two pads. EXAMP L E B This is GilaT to Example A, except that the reference enzyme is an aLane phosphatase 2,4 dinitro phenyl conjugate and the reference pad contains an immobilized murine monoclonal etnti DNp. Figure 2 shows that similar results are obtained as in Example A. EXAMPLE C In Examples A and B, the invention has been used in competitive type solid phase enzyme immunoassays. This example illustrates the use of the invention in a sandwich type ELISA to determine hCG concentration in a sample. The enzyme conjugate cocktail consists ofALP anti hCG conjugate and ALP biotin conjugate the reference conjugate . The reference pad contains immobilized avidin. The concentration of ALP biotin conjugate may be adjusted so that the color on the reference pad corresponds to an hCG concentration of, for example, 10 mIU ml. A more intense blue color on the indicator pad indicates the presence of more than 10 mIU ml of hCG in the sample. This eliminates false positives from the assay. EXAMPLE D The ligand to be detected can be quantitatively determined above sr below the concentration level of the reference coupling pair. This is illustrated by the determination of Vitamin H tin according to the following example. Four hundred microliters of sample containing Vitamin fl X vfi concentrations was pippetted into a 10 X r mm 31ane tube. One hundred microliters of enzyme conjugate, containing 23 picomoles of ALP biotin and of ALP DNP in conjugate buffer, was added to the sample. A dipstick was inserted in the resulting solution and incubated for 15 minutes. The dipstick was of the type illustrated in Figures 4 and 5, comprising a plastic handle 3 16 inch by 2 1 2 inch with a reference pad and an indicator pad 3 16 x 1 8 inch containing, respectively, murine monoclonal antibody against DNP and avidin immobilized on the paper pad.Following incubation at room temperature, the dipstick was removed and washed 20 seconds under tap water and placed in a solution of 5mM 5 bromo 4 chloro 3 indoyl phosphate in 0.3 M AMP buffer at pH 10.15 with 0.02 percent NaN3. After 15 minutes in the developer at room temperature, the dipstick was removed and blotted on a paper towel, The blue color of the two pads was read on a MacBeth reflectance photometer. As shown in Figure 3, the quantity K S plotted on the Y axis is related to the reflectance R by the 2 equation K S l R 2R, and is linearly proportional to the amount of blue dye deposited on the pads. The amount of blue dye on the indicator pad decreases with increasing concentration of biotin in the sample, whereas the color on the reference pad remains constant at a level corresponding to 0.2 M biotin. Thus, even without running biotin standards, one can determine if the biotin concentration in the sample is greater than or less than the 0.2 M reference level simply by comparing the colors on the two pads. As depicted in Figures 4 and 5, the apparatus of this invention may, preferably, but not necessarily, take the form of a dipstick having a support, indicated by numeral 10, of wood, paper, plastic, or other semi rigid material, a reference solid substratum pad, numeral 14, treated, respectively, as described hereinbefore. A further refinement is fully within the scope of this invention, namely, the use of more than one reference and or more than one indicator pad per stick.One clear use of the invention is to have two or more reference pads at differing reference levels. Thus, using the illustrative example of Example 3 just discussed, three reference pads corresponding to 0.2 M, 0.4 M and 0.6 M may be incorporated in a single stick, thus giving a very broad range of quantitative or semi quantitative determination EXAMPLE E In this example, the dipstick has three pads as shown in Figure 6t The reference pad 22 on stick 20 is the reference for two pads 24 and 26 for antibarbiturate and antimorphine respectively. Test pad 24 is on the end of the strip, and contains immobilized rabbit anti barbiturate. The reference pad 22 is next to test pad 24, and contains immobilized rabbit anti FtTC. Anti FITC is antifluorescein isothiocyanate. Test pad 26 contains immobilized rabbit anti morphine. To 400 1 sample was added 100 ul enzyme conjugate cpcktail containing ALP barbiturate,ALP morphine, and ALP FITC. A strip was then placed in the solution and incubated for 10 minutes, after which it was rinsed under tap water for 25 seconds and developed for 10 minutes. The results are shown in Table II. TABLE II Blue Color Intensities on PadsSamples Test Pad 24 Reference Pad Test Pad 22 26BufferBuffer Morphine Buffer Barbiturate Buffer Morphine Barbiturate DISCUSSION It should be noted that the choice of the group to be linked to the reference enzyme is important.Ideally, it should not resemble anything that could possibly be present in the sample. Because of the special design of the reference enzyme, one can vary its concentration independently without perturbing the interaction between the main enzyme conjugate and the ind sub5tratum. The amount of binder substance immehilized on the reference substratum is therefore not critical at all because of this infinite flexibility in varying the concentration of the reference enzyme. One would try to maximize the amount of immobilized binder substance on the reference substratum, and the fine tuning of the color on which could then be accomplished with ease and precision by varying the concentration of the reference enzyme. The problems encountered in prior manufacturing practices no longer exist.One can match any lots of indicator pad, reference pad, reference enzyme and main enzyme conjugate by simply varying the concentration of the reference enzyme, which is also tremendously simpler and faster than doing small scale runs trying to immobilze different amounts of antibody on paper, a process which takes a lot of time and effort. There are many ways in which the present invention may be used with different reagents. For example, the dye does not have to be colored. It can beUV absorbing, thus requiring a reflectance photometer, or fluorescent. The solid substratum, i.e., the test or reference area or pad, is not limited to paper. Anything which binds the appropriate dye will do. Further, more than one reference substratum may be used in an assay system. In this case, more than one reference enzyme and binder substance will be needed.Using two reference enzymes and their corresponding binder substances, for example, two reference values may be set for an analyte. Thus, for example, low and high normal values of the analyte, or the first and second phases of a disease, may be detected. For more than one reference substratum, it is possible to immobilize more than one binder substance on the same substratum, which would bind all the relevant enzymes. This approach can be applied to the two reerence system, where one reference substratum contains binder substance A, and the other one contains both A and B. The advantage of this over a pure B substratum is that less reference enzyme B is required, resulting in less nonspecific background noise on the solid matrices. Within the principles of the invention as just described, and as exemplified and as set forth in the preceding discussion, it is possible to use a great many combinations of reference conjugates and reference coupling pairs in connection with various immunochemically binding pairs. It should be understood that the reference coupling pair may bind to each other immunochemically. The term 1,reference coupling pair is used, in connection with this invention, however, to connote a pair of substances which bind to each other selectively, either chemically or immunochemically, which are different from the ligand and receptor pair which are the subject of the assay. Thus, for example, the reference coupling pair may comprise an antigen to which a label, e.g., an enzyme label, has been conjugated, forming the reference conjugate, and an antibody to the antigen immobilized on the reference substratum, or pad. So long as the antigen and antibody are chemically and or immunochemically different from the ligand to be determined, they may serve as the reference couple. A particularly attractive group of reference couples are the very large number of haptens and monoclonal antibodies to the haptens. The advantage of using a hapten anti hapten as the reference coupling pair is that the coupling between the hapten and the anti hapten is frequently very specific and not subject to interference or cross reaction with other immunochemical species. Among the haptens, to which monoclonal antibodies may be grown, which are suitable for use in the present invention, are 2,4 dinitrophenyl, which is exemplified hereinbefore, and a number of fluorescent dyes, e.g., fluorescein, substituted rhodamine, morpholinorhodamine and Texas red. As indicated in the previous discussion, it is contemplated within the present invention to provide differing quantitative values of reference conjugates.For example, using the materials and techniques described and exemplified before, two reference pads may be provided. One reference pad would contain immobilized antibodies to 2,4 dinitrophenyl DNP , and the second reference pad would contain immobilized avidin. A first reference conjugate, in a predetermined amount, comprisingALP DNP conjugate, and a second reference conjugate comprising ALP biotin conjugate, are added to the test solution. Upon development, the two reference pads will exhibit a detectable level of color of different intensity, each intensity corresponding to a different concentration. By this means, the ligand can be bracketed between or proximate the two reference colors. INDUSTRIAL APPLICATION The present invention finds application in the health care industry and, in particular, in diagnostics.The present invention is suitable as an aid in determining the presence of ligands. Particular application is also found in forensic diagnostics for the detection of drugs of abuse, e.g., morphine, heroin, cocaine, etc. in any fluid, most particularly in body fluids.
