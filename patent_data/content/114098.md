# Friction clutches.

## Abstract
A friction clutch comprises a cover member 11 a pres sure plate 13 mounted to the cover member by drive straps 21 and a diaphragm spring 12 interposed between the cover member and pressure plate so as to urge the pressure plate towards and into frictional engagement with a driven plate. The diaphragm spring 11 has the usual outer belville por tion 14 and inwardly projecting fingers 15 . The outer parts of the fingers themselves and particularly the junctions with the belville portion are stiffened by stiffening ribs 31 which resist finger bending and thus reduce release travel. The ribs 31 extend into and terminate within the belville portion with out reaching its outer periphery. Fulcrum rings such as 17 in corporate raised bridge portion to provide clearance for the ribs.
