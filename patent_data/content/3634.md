# Method of aligning a radio receiver and means for indicating the alignment of a radio receiver.

## Abstract
A radio receiver 10 having a tuned IF stage 20 which is followed by a detector stage 24 producing an output representative of the change in frequency of a signal applied at its input. A predetermined frequency alignment signal 80 and a white noise source signal are alternately switched through the IF amplifier stage 20 of the receiver being aligned. A series connected integrating capacitor 50 and a tuning meter 60 are coupled between the receiver s detector output 24b and ground potential 70 . In operation, during the interval of white noise being applied to the IF stage, the tuning meter 60 is shorted 40, 44, 46 and the capacitor 50 is charged to a net voltage V
