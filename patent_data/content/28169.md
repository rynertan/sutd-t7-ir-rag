# Apparatus for continuously controlling of the cleaning of suede and leather garments.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for continuously controlling of the cleaning of suede and leather garments comprising a plurality of tanks 18 each containing a slightly different cleaning fluid 16 . Each of the tanks is preferably continu ously filtered for soluble impurities and is selectively com municable to a washing device 10 into which is introduced the garments. An additional amount of cleaning fluid is added to the wash device approximately equal in weight to the weight of the garments to be washed. A further addi tional amount of cleaning fluid is added which is approxi mately proportional to the weight of the garments being washed. After washing, the reamaining liquid is returned to the original tank. In this manner the tank will be refilled to the original level and will overflow through an overflow aperture in an amount approximately equal to the further added cleaning liquid. The overflowed cleaning liquid will then be gathered in a sump tank 62 and be pumped to a holding tank 64 and subsequently be distilled to remove pure solvent therefrom. This solvent will pass through a reclaiming line 44 to a position where it may be mixed with cleaning additives 52 in the proper amount in order to match one of the cleaning liquids within one of the plurality of tanks 18 . This new mixture will now be added to the wash cylinder 10 in an amount equal to or proportional to the weight of the garments therein and as such the cycle will be completed. In this fashion, a method and apparatus is disclosed for continuously maintaining the desired condi tion of the cleaning liquids when washing leather and suede garments.
