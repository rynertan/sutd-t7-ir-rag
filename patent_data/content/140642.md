# Acetabulum sizer and drill guide.

## Abstract
An acetabulum sizer and drill guide 10 for use in implant ing an acetabular cup prosthesis comprises a substantially hemispherical shell 12 having an outside surface 14 that generally conforms to the outside surface of the prosthesis to be fitted into a prepared acetabulum. Viewing ports 18 in the shell 12 enable visual inspec tion of the acetabulum during sizing thereof. A circular peri pheral rim 20 on the shell 12 is generally flush with the peri pheral boundary of a properly sized acetabulum when the shell 12 is seated therein. Drill guide structure 24 on the shell 12 functions to guide a drill bit into the pelvis bone adjacent the acetabulum in preparing the acetabulum for the acetabular cup prosthesis. A handle 22 is releasably connected to the drill guide structure 24 for manipulating the shell 12 during sizing and drilling.
