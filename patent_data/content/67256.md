## Description
Light activated control system The present invention relates to a light activated control system, particularly, but not exclusively, for use in vehicles to control a warning device. Even where there is no legal obligation to provide warning lights on vehicles parked at night in built up areas, it is desirable to provide some form of lighting to avoid accidents due to vehicles colliding at night with unlit parked vehicles. At present vehicle owners are reluctant to light parked vehicles overnight since the only effective method is to leave the sidelights on, with consequent drain on the battery. A known system for the automatic control of parking or other external lamps on a vehicle in response to the photoelectric detection of the lights of an approaching vehicle is described in my United Kingdom Patent specification No. 1567306. An object of the present invention is to provide an improved and simplified lightactivated control system for use on vehicles or in other situations where it is desired to control operation of a warning or other output device in response to sensed light levels. According to the invention there is provided a lightactivated control system comprising a comparator circuit having first and second inputs photoelectric ambient light sensing means connected to the first comparator input to provide a signal voltage level at said input representative of the instantaneous output of the sensing means capacitive means connected to the second comparator input and to the sensing means for averaging continuously the output of the sensing means to provide at said second input a continuously varying reference voltage level, and warning or other output means connected to the output of the comparator circuit through triggering means which trigger warning means into operation when the light intensity at the sensing means increases at a rate sueh chat the said signal voltage 3vel passes te said reference voltage level, to cause operation of the warning means. In a preferred embodiment of the invention increasing light intensity at the sensing means will cause the signal voltage level to fall, until it passes the reference voltage level to cause operation of cne warning means. in a preferred embodiment of the invention increasing light intensity at the sensing means will cause the signal voltage level to fall, until it passes the reference voltage level to cause operation of the warning means. The system preferably includes a series resistor connected to the second comparator input, the capacitive means being charged by the output of the sensing means through said series resistor, a diode and further resistor being connected in series with each other across said series resistor in the charging path of the capacitive me2ns, said diode being forward biassed by the output from the sensing means which corresponds to a decrease in ambient light intensity. In use of the invention to control a warning device on a parked vehicle at night the light sensing means may include a sensor or sensors at the rear of the vehicle, the control system being connected to operate a visual warning device whic may, for example, be constituted by the tail lights, brake lights, parking lights, and or the front side lights of the vehicle, which in this case may constitute the warning device. Further light sensing means may be located at the front of the vehicle to trigger the control system independently of the rear sensing means provided the light on each sensor is below an ambient threshold level before triggering of the circuit. The system may include a capacitive shunt connected to the output of the sensing means to exclude from said sensing means output transient signals resulting from rapid changes in ambient light intensity at alternating current mains frequency and higher frequencies. The invention also comprehends a control system as herein described when associated with any suitable warning device, for example vehicle lights, and further comprehends a vehicle equipped with such a system. The invention will now be more particularly described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying purely diagrammatic drawings, in which Figure 1 is a circuit diagram of a control system according to one embodiment of the invention, and Figure 2 illustrates a circuit diagram of one form of warning device applicable to the circuit shown in Figure 1. Referring to Figure 1, the control system according to the invention comprises a comparator 8, which in this example is constituted by an operational amplifier arranged as a Schmitt trigger, connected directly through a current limiting resistor R5 to switching transistorT1, which in turn controls a second switching transistorT2. The collector circuit of the transistor T2 includes a warning device 10, which may be an audible and or visible device. The warning device may include the parking lights of the motor vehicle to which the system is fitted. The comparator 8 has two inputs 8a and 8b connected to respective junction points in a potential divider connected across the D.C. power supply. The potential divider comprises a photocell 6, in this case a photoresistive element, a resistor R1 and a diode D1, the latter being connected across the two comparator inputs 8a and 8b. The comparator input 8b is connected to the junction point of diode D1 and photocell 6 through a resistor R8, the input 8b being also connected directly to the negative supply line earth through a capacitorC5. The photocell 6 is mounted at the rear of the vehicle, to be responsive to the headlights of vehicles approaching from the rear. The photocell 6 would in practice be mounted in a housing containing the circuit of the control system and mounted, for example, on a rear bumper of the vehicle. In use of the system the diode D1 is always conducting in its forward direction, and the voltage across the diode D1 will be about 0.4 volts. With static illumination of the photocell 6, the input 8a of Lhe comparator 8 will therefore be at a potential 0.4 volts higher than the input 8b. When the photocell 6 is illuminated by the headlights of an approaching vehicle the sudden increase in the light level will cause a voltage drop at the input 8a of the comparator 8, while the voltage at the input 8b will remain substantially unchanged because the integrating action of resistor R8 and capacitor C5 will allow only a slow change in the voltage at input 8b. If the sensed increase in light level is sufficiently rapid to cause a drop in the voltage on the input 8a of more than 0.4 volts then the output potential of the comparator 8 will switch over from a voltage near that of the positive supply rail to a voltage near the negative supply rail. When the comparator output voltage drops to a voltage near that of the negative supply rail 0 volts it forward biases transistor T1 which in turn forward biases transistor T2, supplying current to the warning device 10 to energize the latter. If the external light source illumination the photocell 6 is now removed due, for example, to the approaching vehicle having passed by the voltage on the input 8a of the comparator 8 will rise to its original potential, which is higher than that on the input 8b. This causes the output of the comparator 8 to switch back to a voltage near the positive rail potential, switching off or reverse biasing transistor T1 and, in turn transistor T2, thereby switching off the warning device 10. The resistor R9 across the base emitter of transistorT2 ensures complete switching off of transistor T2. A resistor R10 is connected in series with a diodeD2 in parallel with resistor R8. The diode D2 is forwardbiased while the capacitor C2 is charging that is, when the circuit is adjusting to darkness and reverse biased when capacitor C2 is discharging that is, when the circuit is adjusting to lightness . Consequently the circuit adjusts to darkness faster than it adjusts to an increase in the sensed light level. A capacitor C1 connected across the photocell 6 suppresses the effects of lightning and rapid transients, including AC component voltages. A Zener diode D3 and a resistor R11 form a substantially stable power supply for the sensing circuit, cushioning it from variations likely to occur in practice in the supply voltage. Figure 2 shows one example of warning device 10 including an external warning lamp 11 mounted on the vehicle and the front and rear parking lamps 14. The warning device 10 also includes an energising circuit for a buzzer 15 and a dashboard warning lamp 16. The warning device 10 in this example includes a relay RL1 having two associated normally open relay switchesRL1A and RL1B. The relay switch RL1A is connected in series with the buzzer 15 and with a flasher unit 18, arranged to switch vehicle hazard warning lights on and off periodically. The hazard warning lights would usually be constituted by the direction indicator lights of the vehicle not shown . The relay switch RL1B is connected in series with the lamps 11 and 14 of the vehicle, and in parallel with a two way manual selective switch 17.When the selector switch 17 is in the OFF position shown by full lines, the power supply is connected to the relay switch ALIA, while when the switch 17 is in the ON position shown by broken lines, the relay switchRL1A is isolated and the relay switch RL1B is shunted, switching on the lamps 11 and 14 while isolating the buzzer 15 and warning lamp 16. Thus the buzzer 15 and lamp 16 are not energised if the external vehicle lamps 14 are already switched on by the switch 17. This arrangement provides the driver with both an audible and visual warning if driving at night without the vehicle lamps 14 switched on. An e use of a control system according to the invention would be to control a light on a road obstacle, such as a bollard, and particularly a temporary road obstacle, at night. The light may then be battery powered and the battery should last considerably longer than if used to power a light throughout the ight The system may also be employed for the automatic operation of lights for illuminating roadside advertising signs in response to the lights of approaching vehicles.
