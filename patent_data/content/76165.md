# Catalyst component and process for polymerization of olefins.

## Abstract
A catalyst component for polymerization of olefins which is prepared by bringing a magnesium dihydrocarbyl oxide, preferably a dialkoxide, a halogenated hydrocarbon, and a titanium compound into contact with one another. The catalyst component together with an organoaluminum coca talyst is used for the polymerization of olefins and especially for the homopolymerization of ethylene with an Î± olefin having from 3 to 10 carbon atoms.
