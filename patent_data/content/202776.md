Removal of the R₆ protecting group, for example by hydrogenation when R₆ is benzyl, yields the acid products of formula I, i.e., R₆ is hydrogen. The amino intermediate of formula II can be prepared as follows. An amino acid derivative of the formula The amine of formula VIII, particularly the p toluenesulfonic acid salt thereof, is treated with the chlorocarbonylamine of the formula In the above reactions, if R is hydrogen then the N atom is protected, for example by a t butoxycarbonyl group which can be removed by hydrogenation following completion of the reaction. Also, if R₂₆ is hydrogen then that N atom is protected, for example, by benzyloxycarbonyl group which can be removed following completion of the reaction. Similarly, if any or all of R, R₁, R₂, R₃ and R₅ are The ester products of formula I wherein R₆ is The ester products of formula I wherein R₆ is The ester products of formula I wherein R₆ is The ester products of formula I wherein R₆ is Similarly, the ester products of formula I wherein R₆ is The products of formula I wherein R₇ is amino may be obtained by reducing the corresponding products of formula I wherein R₇ is azido.

Such pharmaceutically acceptable salts include alkali metal salts such as sodium, potassium or lithium, alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium or magnesium, and salts derived from amino acids such as arginine, lysine, etc. The salts are obtained by reacting the acid form of the compound with an equivalent of the base supplying the desired ion in a medium in which the salt precipitates or in aqueous medium and then lyophilizing. The compounds of formula I when R₃ is other than hydrogen contain an asymmetric center as represented by the in formula I. Thus, the compounds of formula I can exist in diastereomeric forms or in mixtures thereof. The above described processes can utilize racemates, enantiomers or diastereomers as starting materials. When diastereomeric products are prepared, they can be separated by conventional chromatographic or fractional crystallization methods. The products of formula I wherein the imino acid ring is monosubstituted give rise to cis trans isomerism.

The compounds of formula I, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, are hypotensive agents. They inhibit the conversion of the decapeptide angiotensin I to angiotensin II and, therefore, are useful in reducing or relieving angiotensin related hypertension. The action of the enzyme renin on angiotensinogen, a pseudoglobulin in blood plasma, produces angiotensin I. Angiotensin I is converted by angiotensin converting enzyme ACE to angiotensin II. The latter is an active pressor substance which has been implicated as the causative agent in several forms of hypertension in various mammalian species, e.g., humans. The compounds of this invention intervene in the angiotensinogen renin angiotensin I angiotensin II sequence by inhibiting angiotensin converting enzyme and reducing or eliminating the formation of the pressor substance angiotensin II. Thus by the administration of a composition containing one or a combination of the compounds of this invention, angiotensin dependent hypertension in a species of mammal e.g., humans suffering therefrom is alleviated. A single dose, or preferably two to four divided daily doses, provided on a basis of about 0.1 to 100 mg., preferably about 1 to 50 mg., per kg. of body weight per day is appropriate to reduce blood pressure. The substance is preferably administered orally but parenteral routes such as the subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous or intraperitoneal routes can also be employed. The compounds of this invention can also be formulated in combination with a diuretic for the treatment of hypertension. A combination product comprising a compound of this invention and a diuretic can be administered in an effective amount which comprises a total daily dosage of about 30 to 600 mg., preferably about 30 to 330 mg. of a compound of this invention, and about 15 to 300 mg., preferably about 15 to 200 mg. of the diuretic, to a mammalian species in need thereof. Exemplary of the diuretics contemplated for use in combination of this invention are the thiazide diuretics, e.g., chlorothiazide, hydrochlorothiazide, flumethiazide, hydroflumethiazide, bendroflumethiazide, methyclothiazide, trichloromethiazide, polythiazide or benzthiazide as well as ethacrynic acid, ticrynafen, chlorthalidone,furosemide,musolimine,bumetanide,triamterene, amiloride and spironolactone and salts of such compounds. The compounds of formula I can be formulated for use in the reduction of blood pressure in compositions such as tablets, capsules or elixirs for oral administration, or in sterile solutions or suspensions for parenteral administration. About 10 to 500 mg. of a compound of formula I is compounded with physiologically acceptable vehicle, carrier, excipient, binder, preservative, stabilizer, flavor, etc., in a unit dosage form as called for by accepted pharmaceutical practice. The amount of active substance in these compositions or preparations is such that a suitable dosage in the range indicated is obtained. The compounds of formula I wherein X is NH COOR₆ also possess enkephalinase inhibition activity and are useful as analgesic agents. Thus, by the administration of a composition containing one or a combination of such compounds of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, pain is alleviated in the mammalian host. A single dose, or preferably two to four divided daily doses, provided on a basis of about 0.1 to about 100 mg. per kilogram of body weight per day, preferably about 1 to about 50 mg. per kilogram per day, produces the desired analgesic activity.
