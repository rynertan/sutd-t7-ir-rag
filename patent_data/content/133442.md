# Encoding and decoding system for video signal processing.

## Abstract
An encoding decoding system to be connected to an external microcomputer, video memory, photoelectric read er or printer comprises an address generator 2400 for generating an address to access the video memory word by word, a transition point detector 2600 for parallelly proces sing a video signal word by word to detect a color information transition point address, an execution unit 2300 for calculating an address difference from two color information transition point addresses or the color informa tion transition point address based on a difference between two color information transition point addresses, an encod ing decoding table 2500 for converting an address differ ence to a code word and converting a code word to an address difference, and a decoded video signal generator 2700 for parallelly reproducing a video signal based on the address difference.
