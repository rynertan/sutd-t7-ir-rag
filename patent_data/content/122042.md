## Description
HIGH DENSITY ABSORBENT STRUCTURES, METHOD OF THEIRMANUFACTURE AND ABSORBENT PRODUCTS CONTAINING THEM TECICALF4ELD This invention relates to flexible, substantially unbonded, absorbent structures comprising a mixture of hydrophilic fibers and discrete particles of a water insoluble hydrogel. Flexible absorbent structures, generally non woven sheets or fibrous webs, have the ability to absorb significant quantities of fluids like water and body exudates. They are used, for example, as disposable towels, facial tissues, toilet tissue, or as adsorbent cores in absorbent products like disposable diapers and sanitary napkins. Generally, such structures are made of inexpensive hydrophilic fibers, typically wood pulp fibers. Water insoluble hydrogels are polymeric materials which are capable of absorbing large quantities of water, typically more than 20 times their own weight. When first introduced, these materials were expected to generate a major breakthrough in the world of disposable absorbent consumer products i.e. products like disposable diapers, sanitary napkins, incontinent pads, and the like . Yet, up to this day, no large scale use of waterinsoluble hydrogels in disposable absorbent products has taken place. The reason is that, in spite of the extremely high water absorption capacities of hydrogels, their performance when used in disposable absorbent products has been unacceptable. One cause of the poor performance of hydrogels is a phenomenon called gel blocking. The term gel blocking describes a phenomenon that occurs when a hydrogel particle, film, fiber, etc. is wetted the surface swells and inhibits liquid transmission to the interior. Wetting of the interior subsequently takes place via a very slow diffusion process. In practical terms this means that the absorption is much slower than discharge of fluid to be absorbed, and failure of a diaper or sanitary napkin or other absorbent structure may take place well before the hydrogel material in the absorbent structure is fully wet. Water insolyble hydrogels have a water absorbent capacity which far exceeds, generally by far more than an order of magnitude, the absorbent capacity for water of wood pulp fibrous webs which are typically used in disposable absorbent consumer products. The absorption capacity for an electrolyte containing fluid, like urine, is much less but still up to about an order of magnitude higher than that of fibrous webs. Many workers in the field have therefore attempted to somehow incorporate hydrogel materials into wood pulp fiber webs in order to increase the fluid absorption capacitiès of such webs. Early attempts involved simple mixing of hydrogel powder into the fibrous web. This approach did not lead to any increase of the bulk absorption capacity of the web. See, for example, R. E.Ericson, FirstInternational Absorbent Products Conference Proceedings 1 November, 1 98O, Section 6 at page 3 . Ericson reports that fluid retention under pressure is Increased but bulk capacity remains essentially the same . Several explanations for this phenomenon have been given. Ericson ascribes it to the fact that the fibrous matrix prevents swelling of the hydrogel particles.Others believe that the very poor wicking characteristics of hydrogels are responsible for the disappointing performance.Whatever the cause may be, it is well established that simple mixtures of hydrophilic fibers and hydrogel particles do not have the absorption capacity one would expect on the basis of the respective contributions of the components of such mixtures. Based upon the assumption that the poor wicking of hydrogels causes their poor performance in disposable absorbent structures, some workers in the field have attempted to improve hydrogen performance by introducing fibers into the hydrogel particles. This may be achieved by wet laying of mixtures of hydrogel particles and hydrophilic fibers. During the wet stage of such a process the hydrogel swells. During the drying step the hydrogel tends to retract. As a result the gel spreads over the fiber surface and creates fiber fiber bonds, in a manner not dissimilar from the bonding which occurs when binders e.g. latex are used. As a result of the wet treatment and the bonding by the hydrogel, the resulting absorbent structure is very stiff. it has been disclosed that the stiffness of such structures may be reduced by subjecting the structure to a high pressure. Even when so treated, the stiffness of such structures is still relatively high, especially when fiberihydrogel ratios of more than 50 50 are used. Such fiberihydrogel ratios are, however, very desirable from a cost standpoint hydrogel is far more expensive than, for example, wood pulp fibers. Moreover, the art disclosed processes involve the handling of large amounts of water and subsequent drying. This adds significantly to the manufacturing costs of the absorbent structures. Another approach has been to form laminated structures, whereby a layer of hydrogel material is placed against a layer of a material having good wicking properties. The wicking layer spreads the liquid over a larger surface of the hydrogel layer, so that more of the hydrogel is exposed to the liquid to be absorbed. It has been claimed that such structures provide a higher absorption capacity than e.g. mixtures of hydrogel par . tides in hydrophilic fibrous webs. The wicking layer provides spreading of the liquid across the surface of the hydrogel layer, but does not ensure penetration into the hydrogel layer. The latter liquid movement is still severely limited by gel blocking. in other words, absorbent structures as they are known in the art fail to fully exploit the absorption potential of hydrogels. There is therefore a continuing need for absorbent structures which are flexible and which more fully exploit the absorbent capacity of hydrogels than has heretofore been possible. The absorbent structures of the present invention provide superior absorbent capacity and excellent wicking properties, and yet are flexible, resilient, and have good lateral integrity. These structures are uniquely adapted for use in disposable diapers which are extremely thin and comfortable but which have an absorbent capacity which is at least equal to the much bulkier products which are currently marketed. The absorbent structures can be made by a process which does not involve water or another solvent. The process therefore does not involve the handling of solvents, or drying.The simplicity of the process permits the use of standard equipment as is currently being used for the manufacture of absorbent webs it is possible to implement the manufacture of the absorbent structures of the present invention without any major capital investments, and at low per unit, manufacturing costs. it is therefore an object of this invention to provide a flexible absorbent structure which comprises a water insoluble hydrogel, having improved absorbent properties. It is a further object to provide improved disposable absorbent products, such as diapers, which are substantially thinner and less bulky than conventional disposable absorbent products. It is a further object of this invention to provide a process for making such absorbent structures. RELEVANT REFERENCES The gel blocking phenomenon has been well documented, and the resulting poor properties of absorbent structures comprising hydrogels have been discussed see, for example, E. Carus, First International Absorbent Products Conference Proceedings ,November, t98Q, Section V I and J. H. Field, Pulp ParametersAffecting Product Performance , TAPPI, 65 7 1982, pp. 93 97. Japanese Patent Specification 56 65630, published June 3, 1981, discloses a process for prenaring tufted lumps of cellulose fiber holding water insoluble resins. The lumps are prepared by dispersing the fibers and the resin in methanol, wet laying the mixture and drying off the solvent. The web is subsequently compressed to a density of more than 0.1 g cm3, preferably about O . 6 g cm3 . The sheet thus obtained is cut into pieces of less than 0.5 g each. A similar approach is taken by Kopolow, U.S. Patent 4,354,9Q1, issued October 19, 1982. This reference discloses a process whereby a slurry is formed of less than about O.lg6 by weight solids in water, the solids being a mixture of cellulose fibers and particulate hydrecolloidal material. A wet web is formed from the slurry which is subsequently dried and densified by at least 10 , preferably at least 5096. It is said that the densifying step results in reduction of the stiffness of the absorbent structure Gurley Stiffness values of less than 40 9 . SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a flexible, substantially unbonded, absorbent structure comprising a mixture of hydrophilic fibers and discrete particles of a water insoluble hydrogel, in a fiber hydrogel ratio of from 30 70 to 98 2 said absorbent structure having a density of from 0.15 to 1 g cm3. This invention further relates to a process for making a flexible absorbent structure, comprising the following steps a air laying a dry mixture of hydrophilic fibers and particles of a water insoluble hydrogel in a fiber hydrogel weight ratio of from 30 70 to 98 2 into a web and b compressing the web to a density of from 0.15 to 1 g cm3. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The basis of this invention is the discovery that mixtures of hydrophilic fibers and particles of water insoluble hydrogels may be formed into flexible, highly absorbent structures, provided that the weight ratio of fiber hydrogel is between 30 70 to 98 2 and further provided that the structure is densified to a density of from 0.15 to 1 g cm3. The absorbent structures of the present invention are basically webs of hydrophilic fibers, having dispersed therein discrete particles of the water insoluble hydrogel. The hydrogen particles may be randomly dispersed, or in a pattern of areas with a low fiberlhydrogel ratio, and areas of a high fiber hydrogel ratio which includes areas of fiber alone . By substantially unbonded is meant that the number of fiber fiber bonds, fiberihydrogel particle bonds and hydrogel particle hydrogel particle bonds is kept as low as reasonably possible. Bonds which may occur include hydrogen bonds like paper making bonds , other types of chemical bonds as may occur between fibers and hydrogel particles, among hydrogel particles, and among certain types of fibers e.g. thermoplastic fibers and mechanical bonds. This is important because the high absorbent capacities of the absorbent structures of the present invention are due to a significant extent to their ability to quickly regain volume upon initial wetting. A large number of bonds among the constituents of the structure would seriously impair this ability. It is virtually impossible to entirely prevent bonds from teing formed. However, some modest degree of bonding does not appear to negatively affect the structures ability to quickly regain volume upon initial wetting. Generally, the degree of bonding is minimized by avoiding exposure of the fibers and hydrogel particles, or the absorbent structures, to water in its liquid form, and by avoiding prolonged exposure to air which has a high relative humidity. These process parameters are discussed in more detail hereinbelow. By hydrogel t as used herein is meant an inorganic or organic compound capable of absorbing aqueous fluids and retaining them under moderate pressures. For good results, the hydrogels must be water insoluble. Examples are inorganic materials such as silica gels and organic compounds such as cross linked polymers Cross linking may be by covalent, ionic, vander Waals, or hydrogen bonding. Examples of polymers include polyacrylamides, polyvinyl alcohol, ethylene maleic anhydride copolymers, polyvinyl ethers, hydroxypropyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, polyvinyl morphol inone, polymers and copolymers of vinyl sulfonic acid, polyacrylates, polyacrylamides, polyvinyl pyridine and the like. Other suitable hydrogens are those disclosed in U.S.Patent 3,901,236, issued to Assarsson et al., August 26, 1975 Particularly preferred polymers for use herein are hydrolyzed acrylonitrile grafted starch, acrylic acid grafted starch, polyacrylates, and isobutylene maleic anhydride copolymers, or mixtures thereof. Processes for preparing hydrogels are disclosed in U.S.Patent 4,076,663, issued February 28, 1978 to Fusayoshi Masuda et awl., in U.S. Patent 4,286,082, issued August 25, 1981 toTsuno Tsubakimoto et al. and further in U.S. Patents 3,734,876, 3,661,815, 3,670,731, 3,664,343, 3,783,871, and Belgian Patent 785,858, As used herein Particles include particles of any shape, e.g. spherical or semi spherical, cubic, rod like, polyhedral, etc. but also shapes having a large greatest dimension smallest dimension ratio, like needles, flakes and fibers, are contemplated for use herein. By particle size as used herein is meant the weight average of the smallest dimension of the individual particles.Conglomerates of hydrogel particles may also be used, provided the weight average size of such conglomerates is within the limits set forth hereinbelow. Although the absorbent structures of the present invention are expected to perform well with hydrogel particles having a particle size varying over a wide range, other considerations may preclude the use of very small or very large particles. For reasons of industrial hygiene, weight average particle sizes smaller than 30 microns are less desirable. Particles having a smallest dimension larger than 4 mm may cause a feeling of grittiness in the absorbent structure, which is undesirable from a consumer standpoint. Preferred for use herein are parti clews having an weight average particle size of from 50 microns to 1 mm. The type of hydrophilic fibers is not critical for use in the present invention. Any type of hydrophilic fiber which is suitable for use in conventional absorbent products is also suitable for use in the absorbent structure of the present invention.Specific examples include cellulose fibers, rayon, polyester fibers.Other examples of suitable hydrophilic fibers are hydrophilized hydrophobic fibers, like surfactant treated or silica treated thermoplastic fibers. Also, fibers which do not provide webs of sufficient absorbent capacity to be useful in conventional absorbent structures, but which do provide good wicking properties, are suitable for use in the absorbent structures of the present invention. This is so because, for the purposes of the present invention, wicking properties of the fibers are far more important than their absorbent capacity. For reasons of availability and cost, cellulose fibers, in particular wood pulp fibers, are preferred. The relative amount of hydrophilic fibers and hydrogel particles are most conveniently expressed in a weight ratio fiber hydrogel. These ratios may range from 30 70 to 98 2. Low fiberihydrogel ratios, i.e. from 30 70 to 50 50, are practicable only when the hydrogel used possesses a low swelling capacity i.e., hydrogels having an absorbent capacity for urine and other body fluids of less than 15 times their own weight 15X . Absorbent capacity data are generally available from the manufacturer of the hydrogel or may conveniently be determined by means of the absorptionldesorption test described hereinbelow .Hydrogels which have a very high absorption capacity i.e. 25X, and which consequently exhibit a high degree of swelling after wetting tend to gel block when used in absorbent structures at low fiberihydrogel ratios, which causes undesirable, slow, diffusion type absorption kinetics.Very high fiberihydrogel ratios, e.g. above 95 5 on the other hand, provide meaningful performance benefits only if the hydrogel used has a high absorbent capacity e.g., 25X for urine and other body fluids . For most commercially available hydrogels the optimum fiber hydrogel ratio is in the range of from 50 50 to 95 5. Based on a cost performanre analysis, fiberihydrogel ratios of from 75 25 to 90 10 are preferred. This preference is, of course, based on the relative costs of hydrophilic fibers e.g. wood pulp fibers and hydrogel. If, for example, wood pulp prices would go up andlor hydrogel prices would come down, lower fiberihydrogel ratios would be more cost effective. The density of the absorbent structure is of critical importrance When hydrogel particles are dispersed into an absorbent web of hydrophilic fibers having a density of 0.1 g cm3, the admixture of the hydrogel results in only a small increase in the amount of fluid which is absorbed within a practicably reasonable time e.g. 10 minutes because the fluid uptake of such webs is slow. When the absorbent structure is densified to a density of at least . 0.15 glum3, a marked increase in absorbent capacity is observed. Moreover, the fluid uptake becomes much faster upon densification. The capacity increase is surprising because densifying the web will result in reducing the void volume of the dry structure.It is believed that densifying the web results in better wicking of fluid into the web, so that more hydrogel particles participate in the absorption process, which results in a higher actual absorbent capacity. It is further believed that a densified web may be more effective in keeping the hydrogel particles isolated from each other. Densifying the web further, from 0,15 g cm3 to 1 g cm3, results in a reduction in the bulk of the structure which is desirable from a consumer standpoint, for aesthetics reasons , without loss of absorbent capacity. However, above a density of 0.6 g cm3, further densification hardly reduces the bulk further, because of the inverse relationship between bulk and density.The densities of the absorbent structures of the present invention are therefore preferably in the range of from 0.15 to 0.6 g cm3, and more preferably within the range of from 0.25 to 0.4 g cm3. The continuous flexible absorbent structures of the present invention can be made by a process comprising the steps of a air laying a dry mixture of hydrophilic fibers and particles of a water insoluble hydrogel in a weight ratio of from 30 70 to 98 2 and b compressing the web to a density of from 0.15 to 1 g cm3. Step a may be accomplished by metering an air flow containing hydrophilic fibers and an air flow containing hydrogel particles onto a wire screen. The fibers and the particles become mixed by turbulence of the two air flows as they meet. Alternatively, the fibers and the hydrogel may be mixed in a separate mixing chamber prior to air laying. For the purpose of the present invention it is essential that dry hydrogel particles are used. Also, neither the fibers, the particles nor the mixture of fibers and particles should be exposed to water in its liquid form, or another solvent, at any time during this process or subsequent thereto. When wet hydrogen particles are used, the fibers tend to become entangled andlor bonded with the particles which results in undesirable stiffness of the absorbent structure. Especially when cellulose fibers, e.g.wood pulp fibers, are used as the hydrophilic fibers in the absorbent structures of the present invention, the softness of these structures can be improved by adding small quantities of chemical debonding agents cationic, nonionic or anionic surfactants to the fibers. Examples of suitable debonding agents are disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,821,068, issued June 28, 1974 toShaw, Particularly suitable debonding agents are quaternary ammonium compounds of the type disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,554,862, issued January 12, 1971 to Hervey et al. Preferred quaternary ammonium compounds are those having the general formulaEMI10.1 wherein R1 and R2 are hydrocarbyl groups containing from 8 to 22 carbon atoms, R3 and R4 are alkyl having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms n and m are integers from 2 to 10, and X is halogen. Examples of such compounds are disclosed in U .5 . Patent 4,144,122, issued March 13, 1979 to Emanuelsson et .t. Typically, the amount of chemical debonding agent in the absorbent structures is from .01 to 0.5g6 by weight of the hydrophilic fibers. As used herein, fldryll does not mean absolutely waterfree . For example, under normal storage and handling conditions, hydrogel particles take up some moisture. The hydroDhilic fibers also take up some moisture during storage. Furtherrnnre, it may be desirable to use humidified air for air transport of the fibers and the hydrogel particles, to avoid dusting. Under such process conditions, the hydrogel particles and the fibers will take up even more moisture, but this does not negatively affect the practice of the present invention. However, contact times of the hydrogel with conveying air are short, and the limited wateruptake by the hydrogel during air conveying with humidified air will not result in substantial bonding of the structure.The important criterion is that the hydrogel particles should not be allowed to swell appreciably, and should not develop a surface stickiness to a point that it results in entanglement andlor bonding of the fibers. Generally3 this can be achieved by exposing the hydrophilic fibers and the hydrogel particles only to water vapor, and not to water in its liquid form. Even mere exposure of the hydrogel to humidified air may result in substantial bonding of the structure during subsequent processing, especially during calendering, if such exposure is prolonged. For example, in U.S.Patent 4,252,761, issued February 24, 1981 to Schoggen et al., the entire thrust is to expose specific hydrogel Imaterials to levels of water which result in bonded structures which are unacceptable for the purpose of the present invention due to unacceptabale initial absorption kinetics. In order to ensure that the structure remains substantially unbonded the moisture content of the absorbent structure must be less than about 10 by weight of the dry absorbent structure. The absorbent structures may conveniently be made by using conventional equipment designed for air laying of hydrophilic fibrous webs. In such equipment, webs are typically formed by taking up hydrophilic fibers ir an air flow and depositing the fibers on a wire mesh screen. By metering the desired quantities of hydrogel particles into the air flow at a point just upstream of the wire mesh screen, the desired mixture of hydrophilic fibers and hydrogel particles can be made. The web formed on the screen is then passed through calender rolls which are set to a nip pressure resulting in the desired density of the absorbent structure . It will be clear that this embodiment of the process requires only minor modifications of conventional equipment for the manufacture of absorbent structures, i.e. installing a metering device for the addition of the hydrogel particles.In certain instances it may be necessary to replace the standard wire mesh screen on the equipment with one of a finer mesh size. This need will arise when relatively small hydrogel particles are used, andlor when the mesh size of the standard screen is relatively coarse. Because of their particular properties, the absorbent struclures of this invention are extremely suitable for use in disposable absorbent products. By absorbent product herein is meant a consumer product which is capable of absorbing significant quantities of water and other fluids, like body fluids. Examples of absorbent products include disposable diapers, sanitary napkins, incontinence pads, paper towels, facial tissues, and the like. As compared to conventional hydrophilic fibrous webs, the absorbent structures of this invention have a high absorbent capacity, a high density, and a flexibility which is at least equal to that of conventional fibrous webs. For these reasons, these absorbent structures are particularly suitable for use in products like diapers, incontinent pads, and sanitary napkins.The high absorbent capacity and the high density make it possible to design absorbent products which are thin and yet have more than sufficient absorbent capacity to avoid the embarrassment of failure. Flexibility of the structure ensures comfort for the wearer and a good fit of the absorbent product. The high density low volume of the products will also result in important packaging and transport cost savings for the manufacurer. Disposable diapers comprising the absorbent structures of the present invention may be made by using conventional diaper making techniques, but replacing the wood pulp fiber web air felt core which is typically used in conventional diapers with an absorbent structure of the present invention. Thus, a disposable diaper may be comprised of from top to bottom a top sheet a non woven, hydrophobic tissue, e.g. needle punched polyester , the absorbent structure, and a waterproof, pliable back sheet te.g. hard polyethylene, having an embossed caliper of approximately 2.3 mils. . Optionally, the absorbent structure may be wrapped in envelope tissue wet strength tissue paper . Disposable diapers of this type are disclosed in more detail in U.S.Patent 3,952,745, issued April 27, 1976 to Duncan and in tJ.S. Patent No. 3,360,003, issued January 14, 1975 to Buell, Since the absorbent structures of the present invention have a higher absorbent capacity than conventional wood pulp fiber webs, the wood pulp web may be replaced with an absorbent structure of the present invention of less than equal weight.The reduced weight and the higher density combined account for a reduction in bulk by a factor 3 to 12 or more depending on the type of hydrogel, the fiber hydrogel ratio, and the density used . The amount of absorbent structure used in disposable diapers is conveniently expressed as the basis weight in g cm2 of the structure. Typically, basis weights of the absorbent structures of the present invention as used in disposable diapers range from 0.01 g cm2 to 0.05 g cm2. One way in which this invention may be used is in manufacturing diapers having both increased absorption capacity and reduced bulk as compared to conventional diapers. This can be obtained by using absorbent structures having a basis weight of from 0.018 to 0.03 g cm2. Preferred are basis weights of from 0.019 to 0.021 g cm2. A different approach is to aim at an absorbent capacity substantially equivalent to that of conventional diapers, while fully exploiting the potential of bulk reduction offered by this invention. This is generally achieved by using basis weights of from 0.01 to 0.017 g cm2. Preferred are basis weights in the range from 0.014 to 0.017.The absorbent structures used in disposable diapers preferably have a thickness of from 0.3 mm to 2 mm, more preferably from 0.5 mm to 1 mm. Conventional disposable diapers are usually comprised of from top to bottom a top sheet a non woven, hydrophobic tissue, e.g., needle punched polyester , a wood pulp fiber absorbent core, and a waterproof, pliable back sheet e.g., hard polyethylene having an embossed caliper of approximately 2.3 milts. . The absorbent capacity of such diapers is substantially increased when an absorbent structure of the present invention is placed between the wood pulp fiber core and the back sheet.When used in this manner the absorbent structures preferably have a thickness of from 0.7 mm to 7 mm. The absorbent structure used as an insert can have the same size and shape as the wood pulp fiber core, or be different. In a specific embodiment the wood pulp fiber core is hourglass shaped i.e., the width in the center of the core is substantially less than the width at the ends , and the absorbent structure is rectangular, having a length approximately the same as the length of the wood pulp fiber core, and a width of from about 1 cm to about 5 cm less than the width of the wood pulp fiber core at the narrowest point of the hourglass. Because the absorbent structures of the present invention are highly absorbent, and yet thin and flexible, they are extremely suitable for use in sanitary napkins. As is the case with disposable diapers, sanitary napkins utilizing the present absorbent structures may be derived from conventional sanitary napkins by simply replacing the absorbent core thereof typically a web of wood pulp fibers with an absorbent structure of the present invention. Such replacement may be on a weight byweight basis, which results in a reduction in volume and a gain in capacity or the replacement may be on a less than equal weight basis, thereby sacrificing part of the gain in absorbent capacity in favor of an even greater reduction in bulk.The absorbent structures used in sanitary napkins preferably have a thickness of from 0.1 mm to 2 mm, more preferably from 0.3 mm to 1 mm, An example of a sanitary napkin comprises a pad of the absorbent structure of the present invention a hydrophobic topsheet and a fluid impervious bottom sheet. The topsheet and the backsheet are placed at opposite sides of the absorbent structure. Optionally, the absorbent structure is wrapped in envelope tissue. Suitable materials for top sheets, bottom sheet and envelope tissue are well known in the art. A more detailed description of sanitary napkins and suitable materials for use therein is found in U.S. Patent No. 3,871,378, issued March 78, 1975 to Duncan et al. Performance Testing A. Partitioning Test Samples of absorbent structures were subjected to a partitioning test, more fully described hereinbelow. This test has been designed to measure the absorption performance of absorbent structures in competition with conventional cellulose fibrous webs, both under conditions of low liquid load and high liquid loads.The absorption fluid was synthetic urine a solution of 196 NaCI, in distilled water the surface tension of the solution was adjusted to 45 dyneslcm with 0.002S96 of an octyiphenoxy polyethoxy ethanol surfactant Triton X 100, from Rohm and Haas Cho. 3. This test has been found to be predictive of the absorption capacity under typical usage conditions of absorbent structures when used as absorbent cores in diapers. Absorbent structures were made by metering predetermined amounts of hydrogel particles into a flow of air containing southern soft wood slash pine fibers the mixture was air laid on a wire mesh screen and the resulting web was densified between calendar rolls to the required density. The structures had a basis weight of 0.04 g cm2. On the same equipment, webs of southern soft wood slash pine fibers were made, also having a basis weight of 0.04 g cm2 and calendered to a density of 0.1 g cm3. No hydrogel particles were added to the latter webs.The latter web served as the reference in all tests. Round samples of 6 cm diameter were punched out of the sheets of absorbent material for partitioning testing. The partitioning tests were carried out as follows. A piece of polyethylene sheet the kind of material generally used as a backsheet in disposable diapers was placed on a flat, nonabsorbent surface. A round sample 6 cm diameter of the absorbent structure to be tested was placed on top of this backsheet. On top of that was placed a piece of paper tissue of the type generally used as envelope tissue in disposable diapers. On top of the envelope tissue was placed a sample of the reference material southern soft wood slash pine fibrous web, 0.1 g cm3 density . The top sample was wetted with a predetermined amount about 1 g of synthetic urine, covered with another piece of backsheet, upon which a weight of 4.4 pounds 2 kg was placed.This weight exerts a confining pressure of 1 psi 70x103 Nix2 . After five minutes equilibration time, the weight was removed and the two samples of absorbent material were weighed separately. The loading11, defined as the amount of synthetic urine in grams absorbed per gram of absorbent material was calculated for each sample. The sample was then dosed with an additional dose of synthetic urine, placed back under the confining weight, equilibrated and weighed. This was repeated several times typically on the order of 8 10 times so that the relative absorption performance of the test material over a wide range of total loadings was obtained. The loading of the bottom test layer was then plotted as a function of the loading in the reference top layer. Of particular interest are the loadings of the test layer at the points where the loading of the reference is 2.0 gIg and 4.5 gIg respectively. The loading of the test layer at the reference loading of 4.5 gig has been found to be predictive of the loading at failure in normal use when the test material is used as a core in a disposable diaper. The loading of the test layer at a loading of the reference layer of 2. O g q is representative of the loading of the diaper under typical usage conditions. All experimental results reported herein are average results of duplicate or triplicate experiments. B. AbsorptionlDesorption Test The absorption properties of absorbent structures were determined by their synthetic urine absorption and desorption behavior. The basic procedure and the design of the apparatus are described by Burgeni and Kapur, tCapillary Sorption Equilibria in Fiber Masses , Textile Research Journal, 37 1967 362. The test is particularly useful for determining absorption kinetics. The absorption apparatus consisted of a horizontal capillary tube, approximately 120 cm long, connected by a valve to a fluid reservoir. The end of the tube was connected by tygon tubing to, a glass funnel containing an ASTM 4 8 micron frit on which the Åabsorbent web sample was placed. The glass frit funnel was mounted on a vertical pole. The height of the frit above the capillary tube determined the hydrostatic suction being exerted on the sample. In a typical absorption desorption experiment the volume of absorbed synthetic urine was determined as a function of hydrostatic suction, starting at 100 cm corresponding with a hydrostatic pressure of 100 cm . A simplified test was developed to determine the useful capacity of an absorbent web. In this test, the absorbed volume at Z5 cm hydrostatic pressure was measured 25 cm, absorp tion . Next, the frit containing the sample was lowered to zero hydrostatic pressure and the equilibrium value of sorbed volume measured 0 cm, void volume . Then the frit was raised again to the 25 cm mark and the absorbed volume at 25 cm in the desorption mode was determined 25 cm, desorption . C. Gurley Stiffness Test The stiffness of absorbent structures was determined using a Curlew Stiffness Tester manufactured by W. and L. E. Gurley ofTroy, New York . The use of this tester is disclosed in U. S. Patent 4,354,901, issued October 19, 1982 to Kopolow. In essence, this instrument measures the externally applied force required to produce a given deflection of a strip of material of specific dimensions, fixed at one end and having a load applied to the other end. The results were obtained as curlew Stiffness values in units of grams. Each strip of absorbent material was 3.5 inches by one inch 8.9 cm x 2.5 cm . The absorbent structures of the present invention have aGurley Stiffness value of less than 2 g, preferably less than 1 g, when measured on a strip having a basis weight of 0.03 g cm2. Example I In order to test the effect of fiber hydrogel ratios on the partitioning performance of absorbent structures, the following absorbent structures were prepared. Southern soft wood slash pine fibers were dry mixed with an acrylic acid grafted starch hydrogel having a weight average particle size of about 250 microns Sanwet IM 1000 , from SanyoCo., Ltd., Japan in fiber hydrogel ratios of 100 0 no hydro gel , 95 5, 90 10, 85 15, and 80 20. Webs having dimensions of 41 x 30 cm, and having a basis weight of 390 g m2, were prepared in a batch type air laying equipment. The webs were compressed to a dry density of 0.3 gtcm3, using a flat hydraulic press, corresponding to a thickness of 1.3 mm. Samples of these webs were subjected to the above described partitioning test. The following results were obtained Table 1 Partitioning performance of absorbent structures as a function of fiber hydrogel ratio.

Example II For comparison, absorbent structures were prepared, using the wet iaying process described in U.S. Patent No. 4,354,901 issued October 19, 1982 to Kopolow as follows A mixture of southern slash pine wood pulp fibers and an acrylic acid grafted starch hydrogel material Sanwet IM 1000, fromSanyo Co., Ltd., Japan fiber hydrogel ratio 80 20 was slurried in water at a consistency of 0. 7 . A web was formed by straining the slurry on a wire mesh screen. The amount of slurry was such as to result in a basis weight of 0.034 g cm2.The web was dried in an oven at 1 00 C . The density of the dried web was about 0.2 g cm3. The web was then compressed in a hydraulic press to a density of 0.38 g cm3 . The resulting structure was stiff and board like. The absorption performance of this sample was determined with the above described partitioning test. The results are compared with those obtained with an air laid structure prepared according to the process of the present invention.

The hydrogel was the same as used inExamples I and 11. All structures were soft and flexible. The partitioning performance of these samples was determined using the above described partitioning test, except that equilibration times were one minute.

Example IV Absorbent structures containing different types of hydrogel were made by in line metering of dry hydrogel particles into a flow of southern softwood slash pine fibers. All hydrogel samples had a weight average particle size in the range of from 100 microns to 1 mm. The mixtures were formed into sheets, basis weight of 0.035 g cm2, on a wire screen. The sheets were compressed to a dry density of 0.3 glum3. The partitioning performance of each sheet was tested with the above described partitioning test. The results are collected in Table V.

Similar structures are prepared, wherein the southern softwood Kraft pulp fibers are replaced with hardwood Kraft pulp fibers chemo thermo mechanical softwood fibers eucalyptus Kraft pulp fibers cotton fibers and polyester fibers. Substantially similar results are obtained. Example V Absorbent structures were made by the batch type process described in Example 1. Southern softwood Kraft pulp fibers were used in admixture with an acrylic acid grafted starch hydrogel Sanwet IM 1000 , from Sanyo Co., Ltd., Japan . This type of hydrogel has a saturation capacity for synthetic urine of about 25 X. Samples of various fiberihydrogel ratios were prepared.The kinetics of synthetic urine absorption of these samples was studied in the absorptionldesorption apparatus described hereinabove. The synthetic urine used in this test was a solution of 1 NaCI, 0.06 MgCl2.6H2O and 0.03 CaCI2 2H2O in distilled water the surface tension of the solution was adjusted to 45 dyneslcm with about 0.002596 of an octyl phenoxy polyethoxy ethanol sur 3 tant Triton X 100, from Rohm and Kaas Co. . All absorbent structures had a density of 0.3 g cm3 and a basis weight of 0.04 g cm2.All absorption kinetics were measured under a confining pressure of 1 psi 70x 103N m2 , which closely approaches real life conditions for use in diapers.

The data also demonstrate, however, that the rate at which the equilibrium Åabsorption capacity is approached becomes progressively slower with increasing amounts of hydrogel. The optimum fiberlhydrogel ratio for this specific fiberhydrogel system under these testing conditions appears to be around 75 25. A similar picture is obtained with 0 cm void volume absorption kinetics, but there are interesting differences Table Viz . Since under these test conditions the wicking properties are less important, the relative performance of the absorbent structures is to a larger extent determined by the equilibrium absorption capacities of these structures. Still, a structure which has very poor absorption kinetics .e., fiberlhydrogel ratio of 40 60 is deficient at times 60 min. as compared to 61 39 and 53 47 fiber hydrogen samples even under 0 cm hydrostatic pressure conditions.

However, for these mixtures, a fiber hydrogel ratio of 40 60 is expected to perform better than a fiberihydrogel ratio of 50 50 at 5 and 10 min. equilibration times, contrary to the picture obtained with the above hydrogel having a saturation capacity of 25X. Example VI Absorbent structures were made according to the process of the present invention, as described in Example I. The fiber hydrogel weight ratio was 80 20. The Curlew Stiffness values of these structures were determined. For comparison, the GurleyStiffness values of structures made according to the wet laying process described in U.S.Patent No. 4,354,901 see Example ll were determined before and after densification.

The data further show that theGurley Stiffness values of the air laid structures of the present invention are an order of magnitude lower than those of compressed wet laid structures, and up to 2 orders of magnitude lower than those of uncompressed wet laid structures. Example VII A disposable diaper utilizing an absorbent structure according to this invention was prepared as follows An absorbent structure prepared as in Example I was calendered to a caliper of about 0.1 cm and a density of 0.3 g cm3 as measured under a confining pressure of Q.1 PSI 7 x 103 N m2 . The web was cut into pads of 12 in. x 16 in. 30 x 40 cm . The pads were enveloped in wet strength tissue paper having a basis weight of 12 pounds per 3,000 square feet t 20 git2 , a dry tensile strength of 700 glitch in the machine direction and 300 glitch in the cross Thachine direction. The enveloped pad was glued onto a 13 in. x 17 in. . 33 cm x 43 cm backsheet of embossed polyethylene film having a melt index of 3 and a density of 0.92 g cm3. The ends of the backsheet were folded over the enveloped pad and attached with glue. Finally, the absorbent pad was covered with a topsheet of a hydrophobic but water and urine pervious material. Webline No. F 6211 from the Kendall Co. of Walpole,Massachusetts, comprised of a non woven rayon bonded with an acrylic latex . The diapers had superior water and synthetic urine absorption, wicking and containment characteristics. Example VIII Sanitary napkins employing an absorbent structure pursuant to this invention are prepared as follows An absorbent structure, prepared as in Example I, is calendered to a caliper of 0.07 cm and a density of 0.4 g cm3 as measured under a confining pressure of 0. t PSI 7 x 103 Nix2 . The web is cut into a pad of 8 in. x 2 in. 20 cm x 5 cm with tapered ends. On top of this pad is placed a second pad rectangular of 5 in. X 2 in. 13 cm x 5 cm . The combined pad structure is placed against a waterproof backing sheet 8 in. x 2 in., tapered of embossed hard polyethylene having anembossed caliper of 2.3 mils. The structure is covered with a top sheet of non woven, 3 denier needle punched polyester fabric having a density of 0.03 g cm3 and a caliper of 2.3 mm. The thus covered structure is placed on a 9 in. x 3 in. 23 cm x 7.5 cm bottom sheet of hydrophobic, spinbonded non woven polyester having a measured weight of s 15 g m2. The bottom sheet is prefolded upwardly by means of heat and pressure which bonds the superposed sheets together.The resulting absorbent structure is useful as a sanitary napkin and has superior properties of absorption and containment of menses exudate. Example IX Diapers containing the absorbent structures of the presentInvention were made as described in Example VII. Control diapers of the same design were made, using wood pulp fiber webs of 0.1 g cm3 density instead of the absorbent structures of 0.3 g cm3 density. The diapers were worn by normal infants. The infants were allowed to play in a nursery school setting during the test. The diapers were left on the infants until leakage occurred. In order to speed up the test, the diapers were pre ioaded with a predetermined amount of synthetic urine. After leakage occurred, the diapers were taken off and weighed to determine the amount of absorbed fluid. The loadingX, defined as the amount of fluid in grams absorbed at the point that failure occurred per gram of absorbent material, was calculated. The results are presented in Table IX. The absorbent core of conventional diapers samples A, C and 1 contain about 5 times their own weight of fluid at the point of leakage. The absorbent structures of the present invention contain from 8.0 to 12.7 times their own weight of fluid at the point where leakage occurs. The data further show th3t the present invention makes it possible to reduce the volume o a diaper core by a factor 7 as compared to conventional airtit diaper cores while maintaining the absorption capacity of the diaper compare sample J with samples A, C and I .

Example X A diaper is prepared as described in U.S. Patent 3,860,003,Buell, issued January 14, 1975, except that, in addition to the absorbent body disicosed therein e.g., made from air laid wood pulp there is inserted between said absorbent body and the backsheet an hourglass shaped absorbent structure of. the present invention. The absorbent structure is made as described in Example 1. The basis weight is 0.035 g cm2 the density is 0.3 g cm3, resulting in a thickness of 1.17 mm. Example Xl Diapers were prepared as described in U.S. Patent 3,860,003, Buell, issued January 14, 1975, incorporated herein by reference. The hourglass shaped softwood pulp cores had the following dimensions length 15.5 in. 40 cm , width at the ears 10.5 in. 27 cm , and width in the center 3.75 in. 9.5 cm . Absorbent structures of the present invention were made with softwood fibers and acrylic acid grafted starch hydrogel having a weight average particle size of 25 microns San wet IM 1000 , from Sanyo Co., Japan in a fiber hydrogel ratio of 85 15, using the process of Example I. The absorbent structures had a basis weight of 0.12 glib. 0.019 g cm2 and a caliper of 0.03 in. 0.076 cm , which corresponds to a density of 0.25 g cm3. The structures were covered with a sheet of envelope tissue, and cut to a size of 3.5 in. x 15.5 in. 9 x 40 cm . The structures were inserted lengthwise into the abovedescribed diapers, in between the hourgiass shaped core and the polyethylene backing sheet, the envelope tissue against the hourglass shaped core. Additional diapers were prepared by the same method, except that the dimensions of the absorbent structure insert were 2.25 x t5.5 in. 6 x 40 cml. The inserts greatly increased the absorbent capacity for urine of the diapers. EXAMPLE XII A soft wood fiber drylap as obtained from a conventional paper making process was sprayed with a 10 solution of a quaternary ammonium compound of the formulaEMI29.1 wherein n and m are integers from 2 to 10, R1 is alkylaryl, andR2 is alkyl having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms Berocell 579, fromBerol Chemicals, Inc., Metarie, LA . The drylap was sprayed at a rate of 10 g solution per kg dry fiber, corresponding to 0.196 quaternary ammonium compound on the fiber. The drylap was then disintegrated, and the fibers mixed with an acrylic acid grafted starch hydrogel having a weight average particle size of 250 microns Sanwet IM 1000 , from Sanyo Co., Ltd., Japan in a fiber hydrogel ratio of 80 20. The fiber hydrogel mixture was formed into an air laid web having a basis weight of 0.13 g in2 200 g m2 . The web was calendared to a density of 0.2 g cm2, corresponding to a thickness of 0.038 in 2 mm . The absorbent structure thus obtained had excellent absorbent properties and softness. Similar structures are prepared, replacing the quaternary ammonium compound with non ionic and anionic softening agents. Structures having substantially similar properties are obtained. The web containing the quaternary ammonium compound was cut into pads of 11 7 8 x 16 in 30 x 41 cm . The pads were used in the manufacture of disposable diapers as described in Example Vll.
