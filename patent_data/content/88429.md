# Postage meter having non volatile memory for containing a serial number.

## Abstract
An electronic postage meter 2 has a non volatile memo ry 30 arranged to provide a field to accommodate a postage meter serial number. The serial number may be entered into the meter from a message generator 20 at the end of the manufacturing process after the meter has been assembled and the components tested. The postage meter 2 includes a routine programmed into a read only memory 28 which is in tended to be used only once during the life of the meter s non volatile memory 30 . The routine requires the check of a non volatile memory location which is set once the routine has been successfully completed. The setting of this bit prevents reentry into the one time program. The program can be reused until the bit is set. The bit is set by comparision of the data in cluded in a received message with the value of the data con tained in non volatile memory. If the comparison is true, the bit is set.
