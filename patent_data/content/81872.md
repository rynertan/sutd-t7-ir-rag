# SORPTION HEAT PUMP DEVICE

## Abstract
A heat pump 1 of the sorption type comprising a coolant circulation, having a mixture circulation 2 filled with a liquid mixture of substances, a condenser 3 giving off heat to a consumer circulation 6 , a restriction 4 and a heat 9 absorbing evaporator 5 , whilst the mixture circulation comprises a generator 10 heated by a heat source 12 , an absorber 11 connected through a mixture inlet duct 18 and a mixture outlet duct 17 with the generator 10 and also giving off heat to the consumer circulation 6 , a restriction 13 included in the mixture outlet duct 17 and a mixture pump 14 included in the mixture inlet duct 18 . The mixture is a mixture of high viscosity operating at low pressures and the mixture pump 14 is one of the type having a rotatably driven rotor 20 and a stator 21 , at least one of which has at least one spirally or helically extending groove 24 in a surface facing the other.
