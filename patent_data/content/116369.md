# PROPPANT FOR FRACTURED WELLS

## Abstract
A proppant medium for fractured wells consisting of spheres having a ceramic matrix, said matrix including 15 to 40 of micropores, said spheres having an individual particle bulk density of 2 to 3 grams per cubic centimeter, and said proppant medium having a permeability at 10,000 psi at least 400 greater than that of silica sand proppant media of the same particle size distribution. Such proppants can be produced by forming into pellets a mixture compris ing bauxite, with or without a sintering aid, and, if desired, a high aluminous alumino silicate clay, and firing said pellets, wherein there is included in said mixture a finely divided material which combusts or volatilizes during said firing so as to produce proppant particles having 15 to 40 by volume of micropores.
