# Tablet dispenser.

## Abstract
A tablet dispensing device 15 comprises a substantially flat support 16 having a single tablet dispensing aperture therein. A tray 19 is adapted to rotate on one surface of the support 16 and has a plurality of openings therein disposed in a circular orientation. The openings are arranged to individually align in registration with the aperture upon rotation of the tray 19 . The tray 19 is adapted to receive a tablet dispensing package 20 containing a plurality of tablets 60 . A tablet 60 is dispensed by pressing it from the package 20 through its corresponding opening in the tray 19 and then through the aperture in the support 16 for collection by the operator thereof. Rotation of the tray 19 sequentially places each opening over the aperture in alignment therewith so that the remaining tablets 60 can be individually dispensed.
