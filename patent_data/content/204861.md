# Toothed belt drive between oblique shafts.

## Abstract
Device for toothed belt drive between oblique shafts 11, 14 , comprising a pair of reaction and guide rollers 16, 19 located between the toothed gears 10, 13 of the two shafts and acting on the back of the two branches of the belt, being the axis of each roller positioned at a substantially intermedi ate angularity with respect to the direction of the two shafts of the one and of the other toothed gear and being lined up with the axis of the belt teeth in the contact area with the rollers, being the ratio between the distances of the pair of rollers from the gears almost equal to the ratio between the dia meters of the gears.
