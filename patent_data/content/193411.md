# Multi purpose seeding machine.

## Abstract
A vacuum type seeding machine including a rotatably mounted cylindrical seeding member 14 , a vacuum mani fold member 16 and a supporting member 17 supporting the cylindrical seeding member rotatably relative to the manifold member for applying vacuum to the cylindrical seeding member. The cylindrical member 14 includes ducts 23 extending therealong from an end face communicating with said vacuum manifold member 16 , the ducts com municating with a series of ports 24 on the surface of the cylindrical seeding member to hold seeds thereagainst in a predetermined seeding pattern when vacuum is applied to the ducts.
