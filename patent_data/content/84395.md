# Artificial heart valves.

## Abstract
A bioprosthetic mitral valve replacement comprises a flexible frame 1 having a ring shaped base 2 and at least a pair of upstanding posts 3 , which divide the base into at least two portions 2A, 2B of varying flexibility, together with animal tissue leaflets 4 each having a periphery consisting of a free portion 4A extending between the tips 3X of posts 3 and a fixed portion 4B secured and sealed to corresponding sides of the posts and the adjacent portion of the base. A bicuspid mitral valve replacement has a pair of posts 3 disposed at opposite ends of a diameter of the undistorted base 2 , or displaced therefrom towards the portion 2A of lesser flexibility to accommodate leaflets 4 of unequal size. The frame 1 is formed of Delrin covered with Dacron cloth, the Delrin having differing thicknesses to either side of the posts 3 which merge into the base 2 by way of a continuous curve 6 on each side. The leaflets 4 are cut from flat sheet in a special way to avoid stress fixing.
