# A stabilising bias circuit having a desired temperature dependence.

## Abstract
A bias circuit, for driving a semiconductor integrated cir cuit, for example, comprises a stabilising power supply circuit 31 for absorbing variation of the supply voltage and a control circuit 35 for imparting a desired temperature dependence on the level of an output voltage from the first stabilising power supply circuit. To avoid positive feedback between the control circuit and the said stabilising power supply circuit and thereby to provide more stable operation of the bias circuit, the control circuit is driven by a regulated voltage from a second stabilising power supply circuit 36 . Then, the level of the output voltage does not change with changes in the supply voltage, the required temperature dependence can be achieved and stable operation can be expected. Conse quently, the bias circuit of the invention is suitable to be employed as a bias circuit for compensating for the temperature dependence of a semiconductor integrated cir cuit.
