## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTION DRUG DELIVERY DEVICEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to a novel method and compositions for release of drugs through a rate limiting barrier by coating a formulation with polyvinyl alcohol, which serves as a membrane for said drugs or acts as a barrier film which will selectively permit passage of the desired species.DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART The literature contains numerous references to polymer films acting as barrier coatings. Films on oral dosage forms may dissolve freely in g.i.fluids or dissolve selectively at specific pH conditions. Certain films function by permitting only water to permeate the product giving rise to an increased osmotic pressure. Other films may be solubilized by the action of enzymes or slow hydrolysis of polymer in contract with body fluids. Cellulose acetate, a polymer known throughout the prior art acts as a reverse osmotic membrane which selectively permits water to pass but prevents passage of solutes. Its solubility requires that solutions be prepared in volatile organic solvents, thus leading to a hazardous and expensive process for preparing films, tablets or granules.See U.S. Patent Nos. 3,917,813 and 3,954,959 which teach oral drug preparations having a protracted release rate and comprising a pharmaceutically active component, one or more buffer acids or salts coated with ethyl cellulose and an acrylic polymer, respectively, in order to control the rate of diffusion and the release of the coated active substance. The references also teach use of conventional plasticizers which may give rise to interaction with the drug substance and further may impose shelf life limitations on the product.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention describes a delivery device which controls the release of drugs and rate limiting barriers for drug delivery systems. Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to Provide a novel drug delivery device for dispensing of a composition of matter thereby producing a beneficial effect, said device alleviating the aforesaid disadvantages associated with the prior art s devices Provide a novel dispensing device for dispensing a composition of matter at a controlled rate for a prolonged period of time Provide a novel device which will permit high concentration of an active agent s contained therein, and said high concentration will not exhibit the tendency to be leached from the device nor have its potency decreased by chemical breakdown Provide a novel delivery device that contains a drug which can be used as an effective solute to exhibit an osomotic pressure gradient against external fluid Provide a novel delivery device for the administration of locally acting or systematically acting drugs to produce a physiologic or pharmacologic effect and release the drug at a rate that does not vary with time Provide a device for delivering an active agent having a variety of release rates ranging from very slow to very high by using polyvinyl alcohol as a wall forming material in combination with an active agent or mixture thereof and Other objects, features, and advantages of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the detailed description of the specification and the accompanying claims.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The novel device of this invention is a delivery system shaped and sized for oral ingestion, rectal or vaginal insertion for delivery of a drug or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof or other beneficial substances comprising a nucleus core consisting of the active agent s , optionally one or more buffers and a polyvinyl alcohol film for coating of tablets, suppositories and granules. Another novel device of this invention is a delivery system shaped and sized for oral ingestion, rectal or vaginal insertion for delivery of a drug or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof or other beneficial substances dispersed homogeneously throughout a matrix composed of polyvinyl alcohol.The compositions of this invention are prepared by conventional methods utilized in the prior art.However, unlike other coatings such as ethylcellulose which do not hydrate and acrylic polymers which may either remain insoluble or dissolve at different sites along the g.i. tract, polyvinyl alcohol as a coating remains intact and in addition thereto maintains an aqueous envelope around the dosage form or swells around the dosage form in an aqueous environment. This hydrated state permits controlled passage of drug to the external environment of the dosage form. In addition, this state as well prevents high drug concentration from coming in direct contact with the intestinal mucosa. Thus, polyvinyl alcohol remains an integral part of the dosage form and will not rupture due to hydration of the core tablet as is the case with ethylcellulose nor dissolve as with acrylate type polymers. In its operation, the device is introduced to the appropriate site such as the rectum, gastrointestinal tract or vagina. The polyvinyl alcohol film membrane is permeable to water and therefore water passes through and causes the overall rate of drug delivery to be determined by the buffer which aids in ionization of said drug and alteration of the pH, thereby controlling the relative proportion of ionized to non ionized drug substance. The substance forming the selective film coating membrane is polyvinyl alcohol and its thickness is inversely proportional to the desired rate of release of the drug. As an example, a 25 increase in polyvinyl alcohol film thickness resulted in a 35 decrease in the transport of timolol through the membrane. Polyvinyl alcohol super hydrolyzed grade exhibits solubility in hot boiling water but is insoluble in cold or warm water. Solutions can be prepared that remain as solutions at room temperature. The polyvinyl alcohol used in this invention, however, does imbibe water or fluids at temperatures below its solubility temperature to form a tough, transparent, gel like film containing up to 50 percent water. Various active agents provide beneficial effects when administered to patients. Such agents which can be made more useful by controlled selective delivery through a protective polyvinyl alcohol membrane coating in accordance with the present invention, are exemplified by, but not limited to, the following classes of agents a 13 Blockers, such as propranolol, bupranolol, metoprolol, nadoxolol, sotalol, alprenolol, oxprenolol, carteolol, labetalol, atenolol, pindolol, timolol and timolol maleate.

Those skilled in the art will realize that the type of beneficial agent used in the core is not critical and that any beneficial agent can be used in accordance with the practice of this invention as long as is coated with polyvinyl alcohol. The quantity of active agent necessary for preparing drug forms varies over a wide range but would normally be regulated by that quantity known in the art necessary to comprise a therapeutically effective unit dosage. As stated previously, the thickness of the polyvinyl alcohol is inversely proportional to the desired rate of release of the drug. The quantity of polyvinyl alcohol necessary for preparing drug forms may vary over a wide range.The quantity used in connection with the active agent in order to be effective in controlling the release of said active agent and rate limiting barrier for drug delivery systems is that quantity necessary to bring about the desired response.

The active or beneficial agent may range from 0.1 to 500 mg per dosage unit depending on the pharmaceutically recommended dosage of the specific active agent employed. Similiar dosage and composition apply where a combination two or more of active agents are employed. Physiologically acceptable buffers or mixtures thereof such as primary, secondary or tertiary salts of phosphoric acid, salts of phthalic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid or amino acids or mixtures thereof are employed in the core portion of the drug delivery device. Conventional lubricants such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid, magnesium lauryl sulfate can also be used in the core portion of the drug delivery device of the invention. Other binders and fillers known in the art can be used in conjunction with the drug or beneficial agent in the preparation of the core.
