# Process for the optical resolution of a mixture of the enantiomers of trans 3 4 methoxyphenoxy methyl 1 methyl 4 phenylpiperidine.

## Abstract
A mixture of enantiomers of trans 3 4 methoxyphen oxy methyl 1 methyl 4 phenylpiperidine is separated into the optically active pure forms by reacting it with an enan tiomer of mandelic acid or a derivative thereof to form two diastereomeric compounds and by precipitating one of the diastereomeric compounds formed. The precipitated com pound is subsequently separated and is optionally convert ed into the free base or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The yield obtained is substantially higher than the yield obtained by a prior art process employing a tartaric acid derivative as resolving agent.
