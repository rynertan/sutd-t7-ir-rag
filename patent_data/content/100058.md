## Description
RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is an improvement over the subject matter of prior applications of Gonzalo Prez Gómez and RSmon Ruiz Fornells González et al. The entire disclosures of U.S.application serial number 757,492, filed January 7, 1977 now abandoned , U.S. application serial number 119,609, filedFebruary 2, 1980 now U.S. Patent 4,288,223 and U.S.application serial number 259,680, filed May 1, 1981, are incorporated by reference. TECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to the art of propeller driven vehicles, particularly the art of propeller driven ships wherein the propeller cooperates with a nozzle. BACKGROUND ART Vehicles which use propellers for propulsion are known.U.S. Patent 2,030,375 Kort shows a propeller driven ship.This patent teaches the use of a nozzle in combination with a propeller so that the flow of fluid into the propeller is improved to provide a higher efficiency for the propeller. U.S. Patent 3,677,660 Taniguchi et al. shows a propeller in combination with a Kort nozzle wherein the nozzle is modified to prevent problems associated with solid objects in the flowing liquid. The Kort nozzle suffers from cavitation formed at the propeller blade tip vortices. Recent designs as described below with respect to U.S. Patent 4,288,223 and U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 259,680 have substantially eliminated this problem and these designs also employ a nozzle. A second type of cavitation develops on the suction side of the propeller blades. This is called sheet cavitation and may cause severe vibrations on the ship. While the Kort nozzle employs a propeller located wholly within a nozzle, recently developed arrangements which provide a propeller located rearwardly of a nozzle have been shown to be highly efficient. The propeller has transverse barrier plates extending from the tip of each propeller blade. Even when propeller blades are properly designed with transverse plates extending from the tips of the propeller blades so that, from a theoretical viewpoint, finite circulation or loading values are obtained at the tip sections of the propeller blades, such circulation or loading is not actually attained in practice because of the flow separation phenomenon produced when fluid contacts the plates on the tip sections of the propeller while the propeller is driving a ship. Consequently, the performance of this type of propeller is often unsatisfactory. The propulsive efficiency of ships having propellers of this type is considerably improved when the fluid stream contacts the plates under shock free conditions regardless of the ship s speed and the revolution rate of the propeller. To provide suitable means to create such shock free conditions in actual practice, U.S.Patent 4,288,223 Gonzalez et al. is directed to a combination of a ship propeller in juxtaposition with a non rotating tubular duct, the propeller having an axis, a diameter and a plurality of blades, each blade having a a tip radius, b a fixed plate and c a back or suction side the tubular duct d being coaxial with and displaced from said propeller and on the back or suction side thereof, e effectively comprising means to extend a geometric figure generated by a cross section of an axial plane, through the tip radius of a blade, with the fixed plate on rotation of said fixed plate about the axis, f having an internal radius at a point adjacent to the fixed plate which is approximately that of the geometricl figure at a point which is closest to said duct, g providing means to direct fluid toward said back or suction side of said propeller and h having a length at its shortest point which is at least 20 percent and at most 2 times that of the diameter. The disclosure of application serial number 259,680 forU.S. letters patent is related to that of U.S. Patent 4,288,223 and is directed to a method and apparatus. The method increases propulsive efficiency of a propeller impelled ship in a liquid medium by 1 providing the ship with a propeller having blades1 each with a tip having a separate fixed closing plate designed to have finite circulation or loading values at the blade tips and 2 directing the liquid medium in a substantially shock free stream or stratified flow to and past the closing plates.The apparatus is a combination of 1 a ship propeller having a plurality of blades, each with a tip section having a separate fixed barrier or closing plate of a predetermined orientation extending transversely therefrom and designed to have finite circulation or loading values at the tip sections, and 2 tubular duct means to direct liquid passing therethrough and contacting the tip sections to make such contact substantially parallel to the orientation of the barrier or closing plates, the tubular duct means being coaxial with, adjacent to and displaced from or around the ship propeller. STATEMENT OF THE I9VE9TION The invention is an improvement in vehicles, preferably ships, using a propeller in combination with a nozzle and results in improved interaction between the nozzle and fluid flow in the stern region of a ship. A severe problem with the use of nozzles is a phenomenon whereby flow of liquid around the stern portion of a vessels hull may interfere with liquid flow into the nozzle and thus reduce propeller efficiency. Adverse results of such interference can be diminished by reducing the magnitude of circulation which is developed by the nozzle. However, this reduction of circulation decreases thrust supplied by the nozzle and, in turn, significantly decreases the ability of the nozzle to aid in propulsion. The invention concerns a stern tunnel formed by at least one fin, on the hull of a vessel which makes the liquid flow absorbed by the nozzle independent of the flow developed in the afterzone of the vessel. The tunnel may be an integral part of the hull or added to an existing hull, as by welding. In addition to providing improved efficiency, the fins of the invention substantially reduce or eliminate sheet cavitation by separating an upper part of the flow from a lower part and by substantially increasing the velocity of the flow of fluid into the nozzle. The velocity of flow is particularly increased at the upper part of the nozzle which is the area most important for reducing sheet cavitation. The preferred embodiment of the invention is a combination of a the previously described propeller duct arrangement ofU.S. Patent 4,288,223 or U.S. Application No. 25,680, wherein the duct directs fluid to transverse barrier plates in a shock free manner, with b two fins which form a stern tunnel above the propeller and duct. The invention is useful, however, with other propeller nozzle arrangements. The fins of the invention may be used with any other propeller nozzle combination to produce markedly improved performance. The preferred embodiment should not be interpreted in any way to limit the scope of the invention. The description of the improved flow achieved with the invention applies to all types of propeller nozzle combinations. It is an object of the invention to allow a large circulation to exist around a nozzle to that the nozzle can supply significant thrust to the vessel. Large circulation usually causes flow separation in the afterbody and adverse pressure distribution. It is a further object of this invention to provide at least one fin on the stern of a vessel using a nozzle, whereby deleterious interaction of or interference between the stern and the nozzle may be prevented. A still further object of this invention to provide two fins to form a tunnel to improve the flow of fluid in the stern region of a vessel employing a propeller and a nozzle. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figure 1 is a schematic side view of a vessel employing fins in accordance with the invention. Figure 2 is a schematic rear view of the left half of a vessel in accordance with the invention. Figure 3 shows preferred propeller duct configurations. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Figure 1 is a schematic view of a stern portion of a vessel. A hull 2 supports a propeller 4 for rotation about an axis 6. Each blade of the propeller carries transverse end plate 5 for producing finite circulation. A nozzle or duct 8 is mounted to the stern 2 adjacent to or overlapped with the propeller 4. The purpose of the duct is to direct fluid flow into the popeller to increase the efficiency of the propeller and to provide shock free flow to the end plates. A mounting bracket 10 supports a rudder 12 which is used for controlling the direction of the vessel. As set forth above, one problem associated with a propeller duct construction is that the flow around the stern 2 interacts and interferes with flow through nozzle 8. As liquid flows around the hull, a first flow pattern develops, and this flow is incident on the nozzle. But the nozzle develops a second flow pattern which is not compatible with the first flow pattern. Figure 1 shows a fin 14 which is attached to the stern portion of hull 2. This fin extends longitudinally along the stern, and its preferred length in the fore aft direction is between 1 25th and 1 4th of the length of the vessel. The fin 14 is attached to the vessel at a surface which extends between edges 16 and 18 of the fin. An outer surface of the fin curves from the edge 16 to an outermost edge 20, and an inner surface curves from the outermost edge 20 back to the hull of the ship at edge 18. As may be seen from figure 1, the fin extends from a point forward of the nozzle to a point just rearward of the nozzle. This is a preferred arrangement of the fin, but it will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that the beginnina and ending positions of the fin may be varied somewhat. The length of the nozzle 8, measured in a direction generally parallel to the length of a fin, is preferably smaller than the propeller diameter and larger than 0,1 times the propeller diameter. Figure 2 shows a rear view of the left half of the stern.A central vertical plane is indicated at line 22, and the lines 24 schematically show the contour of a typical hull in the stern region. The fin 14, includes another surface 26 extending between edges 16 and 20 and an inner surface 28 extending between edges 18 and 20. The nozzle 8 has an outer surface 9 spaced arom inner surface 28. The preferred distance between the center plane 22 and the edge 20, in a vertical plane transverse to the central plane 22 and at the most forward point of the nozzle, is between the nozzle diameter and l 4th the nozzle diameter. The radial distance between the outer surface 9 of the nozzle and the inner surface 28 of the duct is preferably between 0.05 times the nozzle diameter and 0. 5 times the nozzle diameter. The fins may be at an angle to the nozzle so that the vertical distance between the outer surface of the nozzle and the inner surface of a fin varies in a longitudinal direction. While figures 1 and 2 show only a single fin, in a preferred embodiment there are two fins which are symmetrical about the central plane 22 shown in figure 2. Figure 3 shows preferred propeller duct configurations.The duct 8 provides a fluid stream which contacts plates 5 under shock free conditions. When the fins 14 are used in combination with the propeller duct configurations of Figure 3, markedly improved performance is obtained. It will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that an increase in propulsive efficiency will be caused by the stern tunnel of the invention. This increased efficiency is a result of the increase of the hull and propeller open water efficiencies. The open water efficiency of the propeller is increased because the fluid approaches the nozzle at a higher axial speed. Hull efficiency is improved because of the increase of the efficiency numerator. It has been found that the nozzle causes unfavorable suction larger than that caused by the propeller alone because the leading edge of the nozzle is further forward than the leading edge of the propeller disk. A pressure depression always appears in the region ahead of a propeller, and a nozzle causes additional suction. The results is chaotic fluid flow around the stern. This chaotic flow is successfully stabilized in accordance with the invention by the presence of the flow fins 14, and a marked improvement in the efficiency of the vessel is thus provided. While a preferred embodiment of the invention has been shown and described, variations within the scope of the appended claims will be apparent to those of skill in the art.
