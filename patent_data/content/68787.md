## Description
PREPARATION OF PIGMENT GRADE CHROMIUM OXIDE The present invention is concerned with a method of producing pigment grade chromium oxide from non pigment grade chromium oxide. In the past, numerous methods have been used to produce chrpmium oxide pigment but it is the present invention that for the first time converts low cost, non pigment grade chromium oxide to a more valuable pigment grade chromium oxide. U.S. Patent 2,560,338 Frayne discloses a process involving the reduction of sodium dichromate or chromate with sodium thiosulfate and then calcining the reduced product. U.S. Patent 2,659,215 Pollock teaches a process involving the reduction of sodium chromate or dichromate with sodium sulfate followed by pH adjustment and calcination of the reduced product.Both of these patents teach processes in which chromate is reduced by sulfur compounds and they both result in the production of large amounts of soluble salts that must be removed from the mixture. In addition, when calcining such a mixture, there is evolution of undesirable 502. Both are multi step processes which are complicated and difficult to control. U.S. Patent 2,250,789 Ayers teaches a process for producing chromium oxide pigment by the intimate mixing of anhydrous chromic acid and a small percentage of a carbonate of an alkali metal, calcining the mixture between 1600 and 22000F and washing and drying. The teachings of this patent are impractical in that the chromic acid used is corrosive and destructive to equipment. The resulting product is dark in color and there is poor control over the shade of green pigment obtained. U.S. Patent 4,040,860 Mansmann discloses a process for producing chromium oxide green pigment by dry mixing sodium dichromate dihydrate with ammonium sulfate or chloride and water, heating the resulting mixture for about 15 minutes at a temperature of about 800 11000C, and separating the formed pigment from the salts. This process uses large quantities of ammonium salts to satisfy the stoichiometric requirement, of the reaction. Other additives such as wood powder, starch, ligin, boric acid, or borates are optionally added to change the color of the chromium oxide pigment. U.S. Patent 2,278,872 Geary teaches a process for preparing a ceramic pigment comprising calcining a base mixture including compounds of chromium and antimony in the presence of a sulfate to improve the color characteristics of the pigments. The process always involves mixtures of both antimony and chromium and the resulting pigments are in the yellow brown hues for specific use in coloring ceramics. It is known that thermal treatment of a crystalline material results in crystal growth. In general, the more severe the thermal treatment, the larger the crystal growth will be, but there is not sufficient control over crystal growth by temperatures alone. It was thought that additional control could be achieved by heating the crystalline material in the presence of an anti sintering agent. In this case, such an agent would have to produce controlled growth since in chromium oxide crystal size and uniformity determine pigment characteristics. It would also have to be non reactive and water soluble so that it can be removed easily. Several well known anti sintering agents were calcined with low grade chromium oxide and little improvement in control of crystal growth and hence pigment characteristics occurred.The agents tried were chromium hydroxide, sodium chloride, sodium aluminate,sodium borate and sodium ortho vanadate. Sodium sulfate, of the agents tried, resulted in the best control of crystal growth and improved color characteristics. The present invention claims a process for the preparation of pigment grade chromium oxide comprising calcining non pigment grade chromium oxide in the presence of at least about 1.0 weight percent sodium sulfate, washing the calcined mixture to remove said sodium sulfate and recovering said pigment grade oxide.Preferred embodiments of the invention include the process wherein the amount of sodium sulfate is from about 2 5 weight percent, wherein the calcination temperature is from about 925 12000C, wherein the non pigment grade oxide is in the form of a dry powder, and wherein the sodium sulfate in dry form is combined with the non pigment grade oxide prior to calcination.The pigment grade oxide prepared by the process of this invention is also claimed. The process of the present invention can be described in general terms as follows. Non pigment grade chromium oxide is calcined in the presence of at least about 1 weight percent sodium sulfate.The non pigment grade chromium oxide may be in the form of a dry powder. It is believed that the non pigment grade oxide can also be used in the form of a wet filter cake providing that proper adjustments are made in the process conditions.The sodium sulfate may be in the form of a dry powder or a solution. The mixfrare is then calcined at a temperature of at least about 925 C. The calcined material is washed in water to remove the sodium sulfate and the final product is recovered, generally by filtration and drying. The resulting product may be milled to deagglomerate and optionally roll milled to a final pigment grade product. It is also passible to re slurry the washed material in water for use directly as a colorant in aqueous systems thus eliminating the drying and deagglomerating step. Alternatively, depending upon the process by which the non pigment chromium oxide is prepared, substantial amounts of sodium sulfate may already be present. In this case it will be possible to adjust the amount of sodium sulfate present to the proper level. The preparation of non pigment grade chromium oxides suitable as starting materials for the present invention is described in UK Patent 2,012,739 and U.S. Patent 4,052,225. These chromium oxides exhibit poor color characteristics when compared to typical pigment grade oxide PfizerG 4099 . The starting material is significantly less green, less yellow and darker as shown in the table to follow. This is related to the small particle size of the starting material, for example, particle sizes d50 of less than 0.4 microns as measured on aSedigraph 5000 D Particle Size Analyzer are common. The process of this invention will bring about a controlled increase in particle size and a corresponding improvement in color quality in a wide variety of small particle, non pigment grade oxides. The pigment product resulting from the novel process of the present invention exhibits outstanding pigment properties. For example, the color quality mass tone of a given shade of green pigment of the instant invention is at least as good with respect to cleanness and brightness as other commercially available pigments. Tinting strength,of the materials of the present invention was evaluated and found to be at least as good as that of commercial pigment. The shade of the colour can be controlled by the use of this invention.The color quality mass tone of the products resulting from the instant invention is compared to the starting material using commercially available chromium oxide pigment as,the standard in the following table TABLE 1Delta Red Green Delta Yellow Blue Delta Lightness Delta EPrecursor 6.4 4.1 0.2 7.6Invention Material 0.5 0.6 3.5 3.6Example 1AInvention Material 0.4 0.6 2.4 2.5Example 1C In the above table, the chromium oxide pigment of the instant invention and the precurosr chromium oxide starting material are compared using a light shade commercially available chromium oxide pigment Pfizer G 4099 as the standard. The products of the instant invention are more green more negative red green , more yellow less negative yellow blue and lighter higher lightness value than the precursor.A lower delta E indicates similarity to the standard and hence, in this case, the materials of the invention are more similar to the commercial pigment than is the precursor. These color comparisons indicate that the invention material is improved in the desired directions and will be suitable for use as pigment grade chromium oxide whereas the precursor is not suitable. In the Figure, precursor materials are indicated by X s and are seen on the left side. Final products are indicated by circles and are seen to the right of theFigure. The asterisk at the zero position on both scales indicates the color values of the light shade commercial chromium oxide Pfizer G4099 used as the standard for comparison. It can be seen that the final products are clustered near the standard while the starting materials have color values which place them far from the standard. The starting materials are thus shown to be unsuitable as pigment while the final products have been improved so that they are suitable as pigments.It can be seen that these starting materials have delta red green values of greater than about 0.3 and delta yellow blue values of less than zero while the final products taken from the examples to follow have delta red green values less than zero and delta yellow blue values of greater than about 0.6. The Figure demonstrates that the starting material has been improved in the desired directions, especially in the yellow direction. In the experiment represented in the Figure the object was to produce a light shade chromium oxide pigment. It should be appreciated that if other shades are desired other standards will be employed. The improvement in the color values of the final products will always be in the same directions no matter what standard is employed. The color measurements are made in a known manner according to standard methods published by the AmericanSociety for Testing and Materials, Philadelphia,Pennsylvania ASTM D 2244 79 using the FMC II color equation ASTM E 308 66 on a Diano Hardy Spectrophotometer . The color measurements are made on a dried 6 mil draw down prepared as follows Mass tone 1 gram of pigment is mixed with a dispersing oil in a Hoover muller. Then 10 grams of nitrocellulose laquer is added and the sample is mixed well. Tint 0.5 grams of pigment and 1.5 grams of titanium dioxide is mixed with a dispersing oil in a Hoover muller. Then 10 grams of nitrocellulose laquer is added and the sample is mixed well. Six mil wet draw downs are then made of both mass tone and tint dispersions on MorestWhite Cards and left to dry. Since mass tone measurements are always comparisons, it is necessary to use some.chromium oxide as a standard. In this application PfizerCommercial Chromium Oxide Pigment G 4099 has been used as the standard when comparing the products of the invention to the starting material.When comparing the products of this invention to commercial pigment oxides, the starting material non pigment grade oxide was used as the standard.The designation delta has its usual significance i.e. a change in a value. A preferred process according to the instant invention is one in which the non pigment grade starting material which has a delta red green as high as about 5.0 as compared to Pfizer G 4099 commercial chromium oxide, is mixed with from 2.0 to 5.0 weight percent sodium sulfate in dry form. The mixture is then calcined continuously at a temperature of from about 925 to 12000C The mixture is then slurried in water and the pigment product is recovered by filtering, washing to remove the sodium sulfate, and drying. The dried filter cake is milled to deagglomerate. The examples to follow are illustrative and do not limit the scope of the claims. Example 1 A 5 grams of sodium sulfate was dry blended with 100 grams of non pigment grade chromium oxide with a mortar and pestle. 20 grams of the resulting mixture was placed in a muffle furnace at 9820C for 30 minutes. The calcined product was cooled, slurried in water, filtered, washed, and dried. Example 1 B 10 grams of sodium sulfate was dry blended with 100 grams of non pigment chromium oxide with a mortar and pestle. 20 grams of the resulting mixture was placed in a muffle furnace at 9820C.for 30 minutes.

Example 1 C 5 grams of sodium sulfate was dry blended with 200 grams of non pigment grade chromium oxide in a mortar and pestle. 20 grams of the resulting mixture was placed in a muffle furnace at 10380C. for 30 minutes. The calcined product was cooled, slurried in water, filtered, washed, and dried. Example l D The procedure of Example 1 C was repeated except that the calcination of the sodium sulfate treated product was performed for 30 minutes at 10930C. Example 2 1 gram of sodium sulfate was dry blended with 100 grams of non pigment grade chromium oxide with a mortar and pestle. Three separate 20 gram samples of the resulting mixture were placed in a muffle furnace for 30 minutes at 9820C A , 10380C B and 1093QC C .
