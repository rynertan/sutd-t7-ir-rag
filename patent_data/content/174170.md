## Abstract
A unit useful for the rapid chilling and or freezing of small articles, such as beverage cans, other perishable items, other articles desired to be chilled or frozen, and the like products, including an insulated container 40 with a lid 41 therefor, a refrigerator unit 101 , heat removing coils 16 disposed within a holding tank for liquid coolant 38 a product chamber 12 above, below or near the coolant holding tank a pump 18 to move the coolant 38 to or away from the product chamber 12 various means to draw the fluid in or out of the product chamber by means of solenoid valves 44A, 44B or drain holes 37 a vibrator 22 , air blast, rinse cycle to remove undesirable residues and timer means 5 for controlling the length of time the coolant is within the product and the length of the drain cycle. The method of rapidly chilling or freezing articles comprising the steps of chilling a liquid 38 substantially below the freezing temperature of water by refrigeration evaporator coils, said liquid having a very low sruface tension, and low residue depositing, such as the family of liquid fluorocarbon chemicals, various alcohol and wter formulations ranging from 40 to 60 alcohol which has properties similar to the family of liquid flurocarbons, being non toxic and nearly odorless, immersing the article to be chilled or frozen into the liquid for a desired period of time, and removing said article therefrom or in the event of other coolants than those mentioned above are used which leave an undesirable residue, incorporating a rinse cycle to wash away the residue.
