# SYSTEM FOR THE BIDIRECTIONAL LOCATION AND LOCKING OF MOBILE MEMBERS IN A REPETITIVE POSITION

## Abstract
A system for the bidirectional precision location and lock ing of mobile members in a repetitive position comprises means for positioning the mobile member along its traversing axis and means for locking the mobile member along the other two axes orthogonal to said traversing axis the positioning means are constituted by members which can be operated in order to engage with the two opposing sides of an abutment on the mobile member, while the locking means are constitut ed by members which can be operated in order to couple to projections on the mobile member and to lock it against the fixed member.
