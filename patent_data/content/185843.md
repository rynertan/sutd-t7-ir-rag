# VERTICAL TYPE SCREENING MACHINE FOR GRANULAR MATERIAL

## Abstract
A vertical type screening machine for granular material comprises a housing. A rotary drum assembly is rotatably mounted within the housing and comprises a drum having a substantially vertical rotary axis and a helical blade helically wound around a circumferential surface of the drum. A cylindrical screen member disposed between the drum assembly and the housing cooperates with a peripheral wall of the housing to define therebetween a first chamber and cooperates with the circumferential surface of the drum to define therebetween a second chamber. The granular mate rial to be screened is introduced into the top of the second chamber. Upon the rotation of the drum assembly, the granular material introduced into the top of the second chamber is moved toward the bottom of the second chamber by the helical blade and due to gravity. During the movement of the granular material toward the bottom of the second chamber upon the rotation of the rotary drum assembly, the granular material is subjected to a centrifugal force by the helical blade so as to be moved radially outwardly toward the screen member so that granular material having a relatively small size contained in the introduced granular material is introduced into the first chamber through the screen member. The remaining granular material within the second chamber is discharged from the bottom of the second chamber.
