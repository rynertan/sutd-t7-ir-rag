## Description
The present invention relates to latent curing agents for epoxy resins. More particularly, it relates to latent curing agents for epoxy resins which cause rapid curing at moderate elevated temperature and which give epoxy resin compositions having excellent storage stability at room temperature. One pack type epoxy resins are preferable to the conventional two pack type ones because the former are free of misformulation and can be used continuously. One pack type epoxy resins require a so called latent curing agent which does not react with epoxy compounds at room temperature but, on heating, reacts with epoxy compounds to effect curing. Heretofore, several latent curing agents have been proposed. Representative examples are boron trifluoride amine adduct, dicyandiamide, and dibasic acid dihydrazide. The first one is hard to treat owing to its high hygroscopic property and it affects adversely upon the physical properties of the cured resin. The latter two are useful in formulating epoxy resin compositions having excellent storage stability but full curing by means of these compound could be achieved by heating at higher temperature than 150 C for a long time. In the case where an epoxy resin is used for sealing electronic components, rapid curing at a low temperature is required not to damage electronic components. It is known that an amine type curing agent can be improved in workability by converting it into an adduct with an epoxy resin. It has recently been disclosed that an adduct obtained by the reaction of the secondary amino group of imidazole compounds with an epoxy group is a comparatively good latent curing agent. See US A 4,066,625 . It is known that an adduct is produced by reacting the NH₂ group or NH group with an epoxy compound as mentioned above. However, it is not known that a curing agent for epoxy resins is produced by reacting a compound having active hydrogen other than amino groups with an epoxy compound. In US A 4268656, there is claimed a unitary, storable, heat curable epoxy resin system, which comprises a polyepoxide and a curing amount of a combination comprising 1 a known epoxy curing agent such as dicyandiamide, a carboxylic acid anhydride or a dihydrazide and 2 as a co curing agent, an adduct prepared by reacting a a polyepoxide with b a N substituted piperazine or a N substituted homopiperazine, wherein said piperazine is substituted with an alkyl, substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl or aralkyl group of up to 12 carbon atoms and said homopiperazine is substituted with an alkyl group of up to 3 carbon atoms, said co curing agent having a ratio of epoxy groups to secondary amino groups of at least 0.8 1. Thus, according to the present invention, there is provided a latent curing agent for epoxy resins which comprises an addition produced obtained by reacting a a polyfunctional epoxy compound and b a compound of the general formula and optionally c an organic compound containing two or more active hydrogen atoms with the exception of a compound containing an epoxy group or a tertiary amino group in a ratio of 0.8 to 2.5 equivalents of epoxy group in compound a to 1 equivalent of the total active hydrogen in compound b and c , the molar ratio of c to b being 0.2 1 to 1 1, and said addition product having a softening point of 60 to 180 C wherein X is OH, SH or CONHNH₂ in the event that said addition compound is obtained by reacting said components a and b , or wherein X is OH, SH, COOH or CONHNH₂ in the event that said addition compound is obtained by reacting said components a , b and c The curing agent produced from the three components a , b , and c is superior in storage stability to the curing agent produced from the two components a and b . A detailed description will be given in the following with respect to the latent curing agent of this invention. The polyfunctional epoxy compound as a raw material of the latent curing agent of this invention may be any compound having two or more epoxy groups in the molecule. It includes, for example, polyglycidyl ether obtained by reacting a polyhydric phenol such as bisphenol A, bisphenol F, catechol, resorcinol or a polyhydric alcohol such as glycerin and polyethylene glycol with epichlorohydrin glycidyl ether ester obtained by reacting a hydroxycarboxylic acid such as p hydroxybenzoic acid and β hydroxynaphthoic acid with epichlorohydrin polyglycidyl ester obtained from a polycarboxylic acid such as terephthalic acid glycidylamine compounds obtained from 4,4 diaminodiphenylmethane and m aminophenol and epoxidized novolak and epoxidized polyolefin. The compound b according to the claims is represented by the following formula where X is a group as defined in claim 1 R₁ and R₂ are C₁ ₂₀ alkyl groups, C₂ ₂₀ alkenyl groups, and aralkyl groups such as benzyl group, with or without substituents such as oxygen, halogen, and a functional group as represented by X defined above and R₃ is a divalent residue of R₁ or R₂. R₁ and R₂ may connect with each other to form a ring, or R₁, R₂, and R₃ may connect with one another to form a ring. The representative examples of the compound b are listed below. 2 Dimethylaminoethanol, 1 methyl 2 dimethyl aminoethanol, 1 phenoxymethyl 2 dimethylaminoethanol, 2 diethylaminoethanol, 1 butoxymethyl 2 dimethylaminoethanol, 2 dimethylaminomethyl phenol, 2,4,6 tris dimethylaminomethyl phenol, N β hydroxyethylmorpholine, 2 dimethylaminoethanethiol, N,N dimethylaminobenzoic acid, N,N dimethylglycine, N The active hydrogen in the organic compound having two or more active hydrogen atoms but having no epoxy group and or tertiary amino group denotes any hydrogen atom connected to oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, etc. excluding carbon, or hydrogen atoms contained in a functional group such as OH, NH, NH₂, SH, COOH, and CONHNH₂. The examples of the organic compound having two or more active hydrogen atoms but having no epoxy group and or tertiary amino group are listed below. Polyhydric phenols such as bisphenol A, bisphenol F, bisphenol S, hydroquinone, catechol, resorcinol and pyrogallol, phenol novolak resin polyhydric alcohols such as trimethylol propane amine compounds such as piperazine, aniline, and cyclohexylamine polybasic carboxylic acids such as adipic acid, phthalic acid and 3,9 bis 2 carboxyethyl 2,4,8,10 tetroxaspiro 5,5 undecane polythiols such as 1,2 dimercaptoethane and 2 mercaptoethylether hydrazides such as phenylacetic acid hydrazide amino acids such as alanine and valine compounds having two or more of different functional groups in the molecule such as 2 mercaptoethanol, 1 mercapto 3 phenoxy 2 propanol, mercaptoacetic acid, N methylethanolamine, diethanolamine, hydroxyaniline, N methyl o aminobenzoic acid, anthranilic acid and lactic acid. To produce an addition compound which is the latent curing agent of this invention, components a and b are reacted in a ratio of 0.8 to 2.5 equivalent, preferably 0.9 to 1.5 equivalent of epoxy group in component a for 1 equivalent of active hydrogen in component b . If the epoxy group is less than 0.8 equivalent for 1 equivalent of active hydrogen, the resulting addition product has a low softening point and cannot be readily crushed. Epoxy resins incorporated with such an addition product is poor in storage stability. If the epoxy group is used in excess of 2.5 equivalent for 1 equivalent of active hydrogen, the resulting addition product will be an insoluble solid with partial three dimensional networks. Epoxy resins incorporated with such an addition product is slow in curing and the cured product is uneven. In the case where the latent curing agent is produced from components a , b and c , the molar ratio of c to b should be 0.2 1 to 1 1 The latent curing agent of this invention should have active hydrogen and epoxy group in the above mentioned ratio, and have a softening point of 60 to 180 C. If the softening point is lower than 60 C, the latent curing agent is poor in storage stability at room temperature and if it is higher than 180 C, the latent curing agent is poor in curing performance. Two or more compounds may be mixed for each of components a , b , and c , so long as the active hydrogen and epoxy group are used in quantities as specified above. It is possible to obtain an addition product having a desired softening point by changing the kind and mixing ratio of the compounds of each component. The latent curing agent of this invention can be easily obtained by thoroughly mixing components a and b , or components a , b , and c , gelling them at room temperature, reacting at 80 to 150 C, cooling, solidifying, and crushing. It can also be prepared by performing addition reaction in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, and methyl ethyl ketone, removing the solvent, and crushing the solid. The latent curing agent of this invention can be used in combination with a known curing agent such as acid anhydride, dicyandiamide, dibasic acid hydrazide, guanamine, and melamine. The combined use with dicyandiamide greatly improves the curing performance without the sacrifice of storage stability. The latent curing agent of this invention can be applied to a variety of known epoxy resins having two or more epoxy groups in one molecule. The latent curing agent of this invention is used in an amount of 0.5 to 50 parts by weight for 100 parts by weight of epoxy resin. If the quantity is less than 0.5 part by weight, satisfactory curing performance is not attained and using more than 50 parts by weight impairs the performance of the cured product. The representative examples of epoxy resins to be applied to the latent curing agent of the invention are those based on glycidyl ethers of polyhydric phenols such as 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane Bisphenol A , resorcinol, hydroquinone, pyrocatechol, saligenin, glycidyl ether or Bisphenol F and glycidyl ether of phenolformaldehyde resin. If necessary, other curing agents, cure accelerator and fillers may be employed in combination with the curing agent of the present invention. The following examples illustrate the preparation of the latent curing agents and their use as a curing agent for epoxy resin. The words Epon and Epiclon used below are Registered Trade Marks. The abbreviations of the raw materials employed in the examples are as follows. 33.44 Grams 0.176 equivalent of Epon 828 was sufficiently mixed with 9.0g 0.1 equivalent of DMAE at room temperature, and the temperature was raised gradually under stirring. The reaction proceeded rapidly when the temperature reached to around 70 C. After heating at 100 C for about 1 hour, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature whereby pale yellowish solid was obtained. This product had a softening temperature of 100 C and was referred to as sample No. 1. 11.6 Grams 0.05 equivalent of PG MZ, 5.7g 0.05 equivalent of BA and 50 ml of methyl ethyl ketone as solvent were mixed in a 200 ml three necked flask equipped with a condenser and a stirrer. To the mixture under stirring was added dropwise 19g 0.1 equivalent of Epon 828 dissolved in 30 ml of methyl ethyl ketone over a period of 30 minutes while the temperature was maintained to 80 C. Then the mixture was refluxed for 2 hours under stirring. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure to remove methyl ethyl ketone and cooled to room temperature whereby pale yellowish solid was obtained. The product had a softening temperature of 140 C. The sample No. and softening temperature of other addition products prepared by similar manner as in Examples 1 and 2 are shown in the following Table. Reactivity, storage stability and glass transition temperature of the formulated epoxy resin composition were evaluated. The formulation of the sample is shown in Table 1. The sample was stirred for 1 hour with defoaming under the reduced pressure by using the mixing and grinding machine. The sample was put into the Geer s oven set to 30 C and the day required for the sample becoming non fluidity was measured. Tg of the cured resin was measured with a thermal mechanical analysis apparatus TMA, a product of Rigaku Corporation by TMA penetration method. The results obtained are summarized in Table 2. As shown in Table 2, the addition product of the present invention is superior latent curing agent because it showed greatly improved storage stability in comparison with compound having an active hydrogen atom and tertiary amino group control alone. Reactivity and storage stability of the combination system of the latent curing agent of the present invention and dibasic acid hydrazide were estimated. The formulation is shown in Table 3 and the results are shown in Table 4. It will be understood from the comparison of Table 2 with Table 4 that the latent curing agent of the present invention exerts synergistic effect in reactivity in combination with adipic dihydrazide. The reactivity and the storage stability of the combination system of the latent curing agent and acid anhydride were estimated. The formulation is shown in Table 6 and the results are shown in Table 7.
