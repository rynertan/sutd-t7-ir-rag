# Reconstituted leather product from fibrillated leather fibers.

## Abstract
A reconstituted leather product is produced from fibrillated leather fibers. The highly preferred leather product is prepared by a process which includes dry chopping pieces of chrome tanned leather, wet fibrillating the resulting dry chopped leather so as to realize an aqueous slurry containing the fibrillated leather fibers, mixing the slurry with an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer binding agent, and optionally, a fat liquoring agent, felting the resulting slurry, removing the remaining water to realize a dried felt having 80 90 solids, and final pressing the felt at a temperature sufficient to fuse the binder.
