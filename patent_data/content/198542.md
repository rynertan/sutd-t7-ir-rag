# Pharmaceutical compositions having therapeutical activity based on mercaptoethansulphonic acid, organic saline derivatives of the mercaptoethansulphonic acid useful for these compositions, and related process for their preparation.

## Abstract
The derivatives of the mercaptoethansulphonic acid are active in the therapy of the bladder carcinoma and in the therapy and prevention of the cistinic kidney calculi. The saline derivatives with basic aminoacids and their alkyl esters are moreover devoid of side effects. The latter derivatives are prepared by reacting, in aqueous or aqueous alcoholic medium, equimolar amounts of mercap toethansulphonic acid, just prepared from an organic or inorganic salt thereof, and of the desired aminoacid.
