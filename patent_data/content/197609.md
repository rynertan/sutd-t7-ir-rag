# Preventing fluid migration around a well casing.

## Abstract
In order to prevent gas migration along the outer surface of a casing 1 which is cemented in a well, the casing is provided with sheaths 5 of an elastomeric foam, which sheaths are able to seal off the spacing that may be formed between the casing and the surrounding cement body 3 .

## Claims
1. A method of installing a casing in a well in such a manner that after the casing is cemented in place migration of formation fluids along the outer surface of the casing is prevented, the method comprising the step of providing the outer surface of at least a portion of the casing with a sheath comprising an elastomeric foam, which sheath is able to expand in a resilient manner after compression thereof by the hydrostatic pressure of the cement slurry which is pumped into the annulus during installation.

## Description
The invention relates to a method of installing a casing in an oil and or gas well. During well completion operations it is common practice to install a well casing by first suspending the casing in the well and then pumping a cement slurry into the annular space between the outer surface of the casing and the borehole wall. After the cement has set to a hardened mass, perforations may be shot through the casing and the cement body into the production zones of the earth formation around the well in order to allow inflow of valuable formation fluids such as oil or gas into the well. The purpose of the cement body around the casing is to fix the casing in the well and to seal off the borehole around the casing in order to prevent that the formation fluids escape in upward direction alongside the casing towards other formation layers or even to the earth surface. Thus it is essential that a good bonding is created between the cement body and both the casing and the borehole wall. A problem generally encountered during cementation of the casing in a well is that due to various factors, such as the existence of varying pressure and temperature gradients along the length of the casing and shrinkage of the cement body during hardening thereof, relative displacements occur between the casing and the hardening cement mass which may result in poor bonding between the cement body and the casing. Such poor bonding may result in the presence of a so called micro annulus between the casing and the cement body, which may sometimes extend along a substantial part of the length of the casing. The occurrence of a micro annulus is particularly dangerous in gas wells as substantial amounts of gas might escape therethrough to the surface. Various attempts have been made to improve bonding between well casings and the surrounding cement bodies. It is common practice to use cement compositions with additives that improve adhesion of the cement body to the formation and to the wall of the casing, and to use foam cements that shrink during hardening thereof only to a minor extend. It is also known, for example from US patents 3,918,522 and 4,440,226 to provide the casing with an inflatable packer which is filled with cement. A problem encountered when using such packers is that they are fragile and require a complex cementation procedure. It is an object of the invention to provide a well completion method and system in which a fluid tight seal is created between the well casing and the surrounding cement body, which seal can be easily installed. In accordance with the invention this object is accomplished by a well completion method which comprises the step of providing the outer surface of at least a portion of a well casing with a sheath comprising an elastomeric foam which sheath is able to expand in a resilient manner after compression thereof by the hydrostatic pressure of the cement slurry which is pumped into the annulus during installation. In a preferred embodiment of the invention the sheath consists of alternatingly arranged layers of a closed cell polyurethane foam and of a closed cell polyethylene foam, which layers have at atmospheric pressure a density between 300 and 1100 kg m³. It is generally preferred to select the thickness of the sheath around the casing between 1 and 30 mm. The invention will now be described in more detail with reference to the accompanying drawing showing a well in which a casing 1 is arranged. The casing 1 is cemented to the borehole wall 2 by means of a body 3 of surfactant containing cement. The cement may be foamed. The well section shown in the drawing is located just above the inflow area of the well in which area perforations may be shot through the casing 1 and cement body 3 into an earth formation 4 containing valuable fluid such as oil and gas. The casing 1 is at selected locations along the length thereof provided with a sheath 5 of an elastomeric foam. Each sheath 5 is bonded to the outer surface of the casing and consists of alternating layers of polyurethane foam and polyethylene foam, which layers have at atmospheric pressure a density of between 300 and 1100 kg m³. Prior to running the casing string 1 into the well the sheaths 5 are bonded to the outer surface thereof. When the casing string is subsequently lowered through the well the hydrostatic pressure of the drilling fluid compresses the sheaths 5, which causes a resilient compression thereof. When the casing 1 is located in its desired position in the well a cement slurry is pumped via the interior of the casing 1 and the lower casing end upwards into the annulus, thereby causing the cement plug to drive the drilling fluid out of the annulus. It is preferred in order to ensure that all drilling fluid is displaced from the annulus to inject the cement slurry at such a rate into the well, that the average upward velocity of the cement slurry through the annulus is more than 1 m s. As soon as the annulus around the casing 1 is thus sufficiently filled with the cement slurry, injection of cement into the well is stopped and the cement slurry is allowed to harden. As is well known in the art, hardening of cement causes generally a slight reduction of the volume of the cement. Although the shrinkage of the cement can be reduced to a minimum by using suitable additives in combination with a foamed or foam generating cement, said shrinkage will cause a tendency of the hardening cement to tear off from the outer casing wall whereby at some locations a gap or micro annulus 6 may be formed between the casing 1 and the surrounding cement body 3. Although the length of a micro annulus 6 that may thus be formed during hardening of the cement may only extend along a small portion of the length of the casing 1, the length of the micro annulus may increase gradually or suddenly after hardening of the cement body, for example due to varying temperature and pressure gradients inside the well, or due to casing corrosion or casing vibrations. The purpose of the sheaths 5 is to interrupt propagation of such micro annulus 6 in axial direction. If at the location of a sheath 5 relative displacement between the casing 1 and cement body 3 occurs, either in axial, radial or tangential direction this will cause a deformation of the sheaths, while expansion of the elastomeric foam layers of the sheath 5 ensures good adhesion of the sheath to both the casing 1 and the surrounding cement body 3. In this way the fluid passage formed by the micro annulus 6 is sealed off in axial direction by the sheath 5. As illustrated it is preferred to arrange the sheaths 5 at regular axial intervals along the length of the casing 1. Moreover it is preferred to arrange at those locations where the seal is most needed, viz. in the region of the inflow area of the well, some relatively long sheaths 5 at relatively short intervals and to provide the higher casing sections with relatively short sheaths 5 which are arranged at relatively long intervals. The average length of these short sheaths is generally between 1 and 50 cm, whereas the distance between two adjacent sheaths is generally between 1 and 20 m. In the illustrated example the foam sheaths consist of a sandwich construction of alternating layers of polyurethane foam and polyethylene foam. These foam layers are interbonded up to a total sheath thickness which is at atmopheric pressure between 1 and 30 mm. In most gas wells the sheath thickness will be selected between 2 and 15 mm. The purpose of this sandwich construction of the foam layers is to provide a robust but flexible sheath which is able to expand in a resilient manner after compression thereof while only a low sheath thickness is required. The thickness of the sheaths should be as low as possible in order to avoid obstruction of the flow of the cement slurry through the annulus during cementation and to create an annular cement mass with an almost uniform thickness through its height.
