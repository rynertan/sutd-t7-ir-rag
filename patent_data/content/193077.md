The ends of the elastomeric tube are flanged for securement to the ends of the flange reducers mounted to the piping system, which thus, provide gaskets for the fl.ange reducer connections with the ends of the pipes of the piping system. The interior of each flange reducer is frustro conical. in shape, so that when the two flange reducers mate for mounting the elastomeric tube, the middle portions of the tube are allowed to expand more than the distal. ends thereof. In a second embodiment of the invention, the elastomeric tube, made of one or a combination of the materials in the above named group, is connected off line to the system, as is currently and prevalently done by conventional and well known surge arrestors and accumulators. In this embodiment, the tube of elastomeric material has only one open end, with the second end being closed off. The open end is connected to the piping system for fluid communication, so that the tube is at right angles to the longitudinal axis of the pipe or pipes to which it is connected. In this embodiment, the tube acts more as an accumulator. The tube is formed with an annular ring adjacent the open end thereof, which annul.ar ring acts as a gasket for a pair of metal flanked rings used to mount the. surge arrestor to a pipe or pipes of a piping system. As in the first embodiment, the outer circumferential. surface area of the elastomeric tube is exposed to non pressurized air or the like. The pair of metal. flanged rings attach to a mounting flange that connects directly to a pipe or pipes of the system. This mounting flange is provided with a central opening that overlies the open end of the tube, so as to provide a passageway for the flow of the flowing medium in the piping system. In a modification of the second embodiment of the invention, the elastomeric tube, made from one or a combination of the materials from the group abovenamed, is provided with a valve stem for sealing off most of the flow of the flowing medium into the tube after the tube has expanded to a predetermined volume. The valve stem is connected to the closed end of the tube, which closed end, in this modification of the second embodiment, is made of metal joined to the rest of the tube of elastomeric material. The tip of the valve stem is aligned with a valve seat formed in the mounting flange, so that, when the tube is filled with flowing medium from the piping system during a pressure surge or shock wave, it is urged toward the valve seat for seating engagement therewith, due to the movement of the closed metal end of the tube because of the expansion of the tube during the surge. The tip of the valve stem is provided with a passageway having one end in fluid communication with the piping system, and a second end in fluid communication with the piping system, and a second end in fluid communication with the interior of the elastomeric tube. This passageway allows for the medium within the tube during pressure surges and shock waves to slowly feed back into the piping system after the valve stem has closed off further entry of the medium into the tube interior. This slow feeding gradually decreases the volume of the tube, until. it returns to its original. size for subsequent use, and also helps to prevent further pressure surge or shock waves in the system by not closing off suddenly. The surge arrestor of the invention may be used in piping systems in which flow mediasuch as liquid , , semi solids, slurries, gases, and sludges. The invention will be more readily understood with reference to the accompanying drawing, wherein Figure 1 is a schematic view showing the preferred embodiment of the surge arrestor of the present invention where a plurality of the surge arrestors are mounted in line in a piping system for absorbing dangerous and harmful shock waves and overpressures Figure 2 is a perspective view showing the preferred embodiment of the surge arrestor of the present invention which is mounted in line in the piping system, as shown in Figure 1 Figure 3 is a cross sectional view taken along line 3 3 of Figure 2 Figure 4 is a schematic view of the second embodiment of the surge arrestor of the present invention, which is mounted off line, i.e. at right angles, to the flow of flowing medium in the piping system for flowing medium in the piping system for absorbing dangerous and harmful shock waves and overpressures Figure 5 is a cross sectional view taken along line 5 5 of Figure 4 Figure 6 is a corss sectional view similar toFigure 5 showing a modification of the surge arrestor of Figure 5, in which a valve stem is provided in the interior of the surge arrestor to seal off further influx of flowing medium after the surge arrestor has expanded to a predetermined volume, in order to prevent excessive expansion, and therefore breakage, of the walls of the surge arrestor during shock waves and overpressures andFigure 7 is a cross sectional view similar to Figure 6 showing the surge arrestor of Figure 6 in its outwardmost expansion phase durinq a shock wave or pressure wave, with the tip of the valve stem having been brought into seating engagement with a seat to seal. off the inflow of flowing medium to the interior of the surge arrestorReferring now to the drawing in greater detail, Figures 1 3 show the preferred embodiment of the surge arrestor of the present invention. The surge arrestor 10 is mounted in line t in a piping system that is to be protected against pressure and shock waves, or spikes.

## Description
ON PRESSURIZED SURGE ARPESTOR FOR USEIN PIPELIN SYSTEMS FOR DISSIPATING THE HARMFUL EFFECTS F PRESSURE SURGES AND SHOCK WAVESThe present invention is directed to a device for absorbing the excessive pressure buil.d up and shock waves produced in piping systems.Pressure surges, overpressures, and pulsations, commonly termed water hammer, occur in piping systems when the fluid being pumped is suddenly restricted in further movement, or has its direction reversed or changed, or when a pump of the system is suddenly stopped, or when a check valve in the system suddenly closes. All pipelines in which fluids flow experience such pressure surges and shock waves at one time or another, Some of these shock waves and pressure surges can be harmful, especially over a long span of time where individual pressure surges and shocks act over time to weaken the structural. integrity of the piping system with the eventual. breakdown of the system.In the case of a severe shock wave or pressure surge in a piping system not previously designed to withstand and absorb such a severe wave, breakdown can occur from one such severe shock or severe pressure surge. Conventional devices used today to absorb or lessen the force of such pressure surges and shock waves usually are of the accumulator type, where a volume is filled with pressurized gas, which gas acts on a flexible bladder, such as rubber, so that when the accumulator is connected to the flow of medium through the piping system, the shocks and pressure surges are partially dissipated by the overpressures impinging upon the biased bladder. There are many variations on these accumulator type absorbers, but all use a pressurized gas to absorb the dangerous kinetic energy of the flowing medium. However, since these accumulators are mounted at right angles to the flow of the.medium in the system, only some, not all, of the pressure surges and shock waves ever impinge upon the bladder of the accumulator, regardless of how many of these accumulators are installed in the piping system.To effectively control all pressure surges and shock waves with these conventional accumulators would require more accumulators in the system than usually economically warranted or practicable. Even then, not all of these overpressures and shocks can be dissipated.Further, the typical right angle mounting of these accumulators causes pressure surges in and of itself due to the sudden change of direction of the flow of the flowing medium, so that part of the useful effects of these conventional. accumulators serve only to cancel the damage their existence in the piping system has caused Another type of surge absorber or arrestor is a pistontype absorber, where a flexible walled cartridge, surrounded by an envelope, is gas pressurized to absorb the shock. As the cartridge is forced inwardly by a pressure surge, it is forced to compress and to absorb the pressure surge. These are also mounted off line, that is, at right angles to the flow of the flowing medium in the pipes. Since pressurized gas is also used in this, it is not quick to respond to sudden changes in the system.It is also expensive and is not capable of absorbing severe shocks or pressure surges without a prohibitive amount of such pistontype absorbers being mounted along the piping system.While mostly all conventional. pressure surge arrestors in use today are mounted off line to the piping system, that is at right angles to the portions of the pipes of the system to which they are connected, there does exist one such conventional. device that is mounted in line, so that the direction of the flow of the flowing medium in the system is the same as that through the arrestor. Such in line arrestors are connected between two pipes so that the medium flows through the pipes and entirely through the arrestor in the same axial direction with none or very little change of flow direction. However, such in line pressure surge arrestors, or de surgers as they are commonly known, also use pressurized gas to absorb the kinetic energies of the pressure shocks and surges.In this case, the flowing medium flows inside a hollow metallic mandrel. provided wiht a series of circumferential.throttling orifices through which the flowing media pass.Mounted concentric about the mandrel is a flexible rubber sleeve upon which the jets of flowing media from the orifices impinge. The flexible rubber sleeve is in contact with pressurized gas contained within a precharged gas chamber formed by the housing of the device. The flexible rubber sleeve serves to provide a barrier between the flowing medium and the pressurized gas, so that the pressurized gas may take up the excessive energy of the pressure surgeHowever, such device is limited in application, since it must be ensured that the orifices do not become clogged, which is difficult to prevent, even in those cases where only pure water is the flowing medium. In the case of flowing slurry, for example, it is impossible to use this device.Further, the fact that the absorbing function is, again, performed by pressurized gas, such shock absorbing qualities of the device is limited, slow, and, at times, prohibitively expensive for employment in a piping system.It is, therefore, the primary object of the present invention to provide a surge arrestor that obviates the need of using pressurized gas acting upon a servile member therefore, for taking up excessive kinetic energies of shock waves and pressure surges of a piping system.It is also an object of the present invention to allow for enhanced energy absorption of the shock and pressure waves of the piping system, that also reacts more quickly to such shock and pressure waves.In one embodiment of the invention, such reaction time is approximately instantaneous and continuous. It is another object of the present invention to allow for a series of the surge arrestors to be mounted in a piping system at strategic locations thereof, such that it is not economically unfeasible to do so, since the cost of a surge arrestor of the present invention is drastically lower than that for those currently used and sold.It is stil.l another object of the present invention to allow for easy and relatively simple mounting of the surge arrestor in all piping systems, without the difficult, time consuming, and tedious task of providing a pressurized gas, as is necessary with currently used and currently employed arrestors and accumulators. It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a surge arrestor that is substantially maintenance free, and which, with the proper additives provided depending upon the environment in which it is to be used, can provide trouble free service for outlasting that for the currentl.v used arrestors and accumulators.Toward these above ends, as well as others, the surge arrestor of the present invention is a tubular element made of synthetic elastomeric material chosen from the group consisting of polyurethane, ethylene propylene diene polymer, ethylene acrylic elastomer, carboxylated nitrile, and chlorosulfonated polyethylene, each within the durometer hardness range of 50A Shore to 95A Shore, inclusive, and polyester elastomer, in the durometer hardness range of 70A Shore to 95A Shore. Each of the above named elements within the hardness range above named provides a material that is flexible with the following properties High tensile strength high tensile modulus in lower extension percentages high ultimate elongation low tensile set long flexural life high dampening through hysteresis loss consistancy of physical properties over a wide temperature range and environmental. conditions high temperature resistance low temperature resistance high chemical resistance and high abrasion resistance.These properties allow for the complete elimination of pressurized gas, which has hitherto been requisite for absorbing the dangerous energies of shock and pressure waves.In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the surge arrestor, made from one or a combination of the above named elastomeric materials within the hardness range above given, is formed into a hollow tubular form with an open inlet and open outlet at the two ends thereof, so that the surge arrestor is mounted inline in the piping system in which it is to be used.The flowing medium of the system flows longitudinally axially through the arrestor in the same direction as it flows through the portions of the piping system to which the surge arrestor is attached.The elastomeric tube is connected between ends of adjacent pipes of the system via a housing made of a pair of flange reducers, which define an annular reqion between the outer surface area of the tube and the inner surface area of the flange reducers, which annular region relatively non elastic material. and having means for mounting said second end of said valve stem therein, said second closed end of said elastomeric element 50 moving toward or away from said one open end of said element 50 when said element is full with flowing medium or empty of it, respectively, so that the inflow into said element may be stopped upon reaching a predetermined expansion thereof.14. The surge arrestor according to Claim 13, characterised in that said means for fixedly mounting comprises a flange means fixable to a portion of the piping system to which said element 50 is to be attached and means for fixedly mounting further comprising means for attaching said flange means to said element 50 adjacent said one open end thereof said flange means having a valve seat for mating relationship with said first end of said valve stem, and a bore in said valve seat for providing fluid communication between said one open end of said element.and the interior of the piping system.15. The surge arrestor according to Claim Idr characterised in that said element 50 further comprises an annular ring adjacent said one open end thereof, said annular ring being mountable between said flange means and said means for attaching said flange means to provide a gasket therefor. 16. A method of arresting pressure surges in piping systems, pumping systems, hydraulic systems, and the like, characterised by choosing an elastomeric material. for a tubular element having a hollow interior that has a durometer reading of between 50A Shore and 95A Shore inserting the elastomeric tubular element having a hollow interior in a piping system through which a medium may flow from the conduits of the piping system, and the like, so that at least a portion of the medium flowing in the system also flows in the tubular element and mounting the tubular element to the system so that the outer circumferential surface of the tubular element is exposed to non pressurized air.17. The method according to Claim 16 characterised in that said step of choosing comprises selecting a material taken from the group polyurethane, ethylene propylene diene polymer, ethvlene acrylic elastomer, carboxvlated nitrile, and chloro sul fonated polyethylene.18. The method according to Claim 16r characterised in that said step of inserting comprises emplacing the tubular element in line in the system so that the flow of medium flows entirely through the tubular element in the same general direction as it flows through the system elements to which the tubular element is connected. 19. A method of using synthetic elastomers of poly urethane, ethylene propylene diene polymer, ethylene acrylic elastomer, carboxylated nitride, and chlorosulfonated polyethylene, in the durometer range of 50A Shore to 95A Shore, characterised by inserting a tubular form of at least one of the synthetic elastomeric materials taken from the above said group in a piping system to arrest pressure surges and shock, and to dissipate the harmful. energy associated with the pressure surges and shock, so as to prevent breakage of the system so that the flowing medium of the system may at least partially flow through the tubular form of the synthetic elastomer. 20. The method of use according to Claim 19, characterised in that said group further comprises pol.yether elastomer in the durometer range of 70A Shore to 95A Shore. 21. The method of use according to Claim 20, characterised in that said step of inserting comprises forming the tubular form of the chosen el.astomeric compound into a hollow interior with open ends at each end of the tubular form, and emplacing the tubular form in line in the piping system so that the flowing medium flows through the entire length of the tubular form and in the same general. direction of flow as in the portions of the piping system to which the tubular form is connected. 22. A method of using, according to Claim 19, characterised in that said step f inserting a tubular form in a piping system to arrest pressure surges and shock, and to dissipate the harmful. energy associated therewith to prevent breakdown of the piping system comprises exposing the outer circumferential. surface area of the tubular form to non pressurized gas. Polyurethane, ethylene propylene diene polymer, ethylene acrylic elastomer, carboxylated nitride, chlorosulfonated polyethylene, each having a durometer hardness range of between 50A Shore and 95A Shore, inclusive and polyester elastomer, such as DuPont s HYTREL, having a durometer hardness range of between 70A Shore and 95A Shore, inclusive.The inherent properties and characteristics of each of these above stated synthetic elastomers, in combination with the hardness reading within the range above indicated, provides a flexible, stretchable, and strong core for the surge arrestor of the present invention, such that the following is found a High tensile strength b High tensile modulus in lower extension percentages c High ultimate elongation d Low tensile set e Long flexural life f High dampening exhibited through hysterisis loss conversion of dynamic energy to heat energy g Consistancy of physical properties over Åa wide temperature range and environmental. conditions h High temperature resistance i Low temperature resistance j High chemical. resistance k High abrasion resistance. Material previously used in desurgers, surge arrestors, and surge accumulators have not been sufficient to withstand the pressure exerted on them without the reinforcement provided by a pressurized gas, which has also necessitated time consuming, expensive and, at times, hazardous installation procedures, and has still not allowed for truly effective control and absorption of pressure waves and shock waves.As can be seen in Figure 3, the circular crosssection bladder or core 12 is hollow, so that the flowing medium passes directly through the interior of the core in a direction parallel to its longi tudinal. axis, so that when pressure surges or shock waves occur, such are almost instantaneously dissipated by the expansion of core 12.The surge arrestor 10 is also provided with a pair of flange reducers 16 and 18 for, firstly providing an expansion chamber 20 for the core 12 and, secondly, for mounting the surge arrestor between the ends of pipes of a piping system, in a manner shown inFigure 1. Each flange reducer 16 and 18 is provided with a first circular end flange 22 and 24, respectively, and a second circular end flange 26 and 28, respectively, for connecting the two flange reducers together thereby. The end flanges 26 and 28 are of the same diametric extension, which is greater than the diametric extension of each of the circular end fl.anges 22 and 24. The end flanges of each flange reducer delimit the end portions of the central casing 30 and 32, respectively, of each flange reducer.Each central casing 30 and 32 is substantially a frustro conical shaped shell defining a hollow interior in which is mounted half of the elastomeric core 12. The substantial frustroconical shape to the casing shells 30 and 32 define a substantially frustro conical shaped chamber in which the elastomeric core is mounted, so that the portions of the elastomeric core nearer the center thereof are allowed to expand by a greater amount than the portions of the elastomeric core closer to the ends thereof.As clearly shown in Figure 3, the twol.arger endflanges 26 and 28 are affixed to each other by bolts 34 with gasket 36 providing the seal therebetween. Each of the smaller end flanges 22 and 24 is provided with holes 22 and 24 , rqspectively, for mounting the surge arrestor between the ends of pipes of a piping system, as shown in Figure 1.To achieve such connection between the ends of the pipes and the reduced ends of the flange reducers, the two end portions 12 and 12 of the el.astomeric core are flanged to define a circular annular ring fixedly secured to the outer end surfaces of the smaller flange ends of the flange reducers, in a manner clearly shown in Figure 3. Such securement of the annular ring portions to the flange ends of the flange reducers may be achieved by any well known adhesive bonding technique, mechanical attachment, and the like. These annular ring portions 12 and 12 thus serve as gaskets, the inherent properties of each of the materials noted above, of which the elastomeric core is made, also providing excellent fluid sealing qual.ities. Figure 1 shows three surge arrestors tO mounted along a piping system consisting of pipes 40, 42, 44 and 46. These surge arrestors 10 are shown equally spaced along the common longitudinal axis of the pipes. Such is the general rule in using the surge arrestors of the present invention, such being spaced equidistantly along the piping system.The exact spacing between the surge arrestors is determined by the size of the pipes employed, the flowing medium being pumped through the piping system, the diameter of the elastomeric core 12 used in the surge arrestor, and the pressures to which the flowing medium are subject Surge arrestor 10 will, r also, necessarily be employed directly adjacent to all valves and pumps, the main sources of shock and pressure waves. Surge arrestors may also be employed adjacent to sharp turns and bends in the piping system, as well, where pressure differentials are marked. Typically, the wall thickness of the elastomeric use range between 1 8 inch to several inches. The diameter of the circular elastomeric core 12 is in the range of between 1 2 inch for hydraulic systems to 72 inches for very large capacity systems. Further, the type of flowing medium flowing in the piping system generally is not critical to the use of the surge arrestors of the present invention, in contradistinction to prior art devices. The surge arrestor of the present invention may be used in systems through which flow gases water water mixtures oil scurries sludges semi solid matter and concrete materials.Thus, the flowing medium could be slurrie d meat, cheese, sand, stone, cement and water and grout, such as that used t0 fill the hole8 which are bored underground in tunnels during mining, and a host of other media. The elastomeric material from which the core of the surge arrestor is made either has ample inherent resistance to corrosion and wear from any of the many types of flowing media flowing in piping systems, or can be made to have such properties by suitabl.y chosen additives, added thereto in the well known manner. Any type of flowing medium may pass through the surge arrestor with the assurance that the surge arrestor will not be damaged thereby.Further, to enhance the resistance to any aggressive material flowing in the piping system, the surge arrestor of the present invention may be provided with another inner tubular core of rubber, properly treated and formulated to withstand the attack, and or corrosion caused by the flowing medium in the piping system. This inner tubular rubber core constitutes a protective barrier for the outer, elastomeric core, the two cores being bonded to each other by well known adhesive techniques.In the case of the use of an inner rubber protective core, the annular end rings 12 and 12 are also overlaid with similar annular end rings of the inner rubber core, or in the alternative, the outer el.astomeric core s annular rings may be eliminated altogether, with only the inner rubber annular rings being used as gaskets for the flange reducer ends 22 and 24.The preferred embodiment of Figures 1 3, as mentioned above, is for in line1, connection of the surge arrestor to the piping system, so that the flowing medium passes entirely through the elastomeric core in substantially the same direction as it flows through the portions of the piping system to which the surge arrestor is connected. This provides almost instantaneous reaction to shock and pressure waves in the system, as well as obviating secondary pressure and shock waves produced by the 1off line, transversely mounted surge arrestor embodiment of the present inventionThe off line surge arrestor 10 is shown inFigure 5, and includes an elastomeric, hollow, tubular element 50 made of one of the synthetic elastomers of the group given above, within the same hardness range thereof.The element 50 has a closed end 50 and an open end 50 oppositely disposed relative to the closed end 50 , so that the flowing medium may enter through the open end and expand, or inflate, the elastomeric element 50 during pressure waves or shock waves. The surge arrestor 101 also has a metallic mounting plate 52 having a central aperture 52 through which the flowing medium passes into the interior of the elastomeric element 50. The metallic mounting plate 52 is mountable to a flange connector 54 of a T connector 64 of the piping system for connecting the elastomeric element 50 at right angles to the longitudinal axis of the pipe to which it is to be connected.The elastomeric element 50 also has an annular ring portion 60 for mounting the elastomeric element 50 to the plate 52 and, thus, to the pipe via flange connector 54. The annular ring portion 60 is secured between the plate 52 and a metal ring 58 by. bolts 62, as clearly shown in Figure 5.The bolts 62 pass through a plurality of aligned openings in the metal ring 58, in the annular ring portion 60, the metal plate 52, and, finally, the flange connector 54, thus securing the entire surge arrestor to a portion of the piping system in a transverse fashion, as shown in Figure 4.In Figure 4, there are shown three such off line surge arrestors 10 connected along piping via a plurality of T connectors 64. Each T connector 64 has a flange connector 54 for connecting the surge arrestor 10 thereto. The surge arrestors 10 are spaced at equal. intervals along the pipes, the distance being dependent upon the flowing medium, the pressures in the system, the size of the system s piping, harmonics, and the like. As in the first preferred embodiment, such surge arrestors 10 are also provided directly adjacent to valves and pumps. In each of the two embodiments thus far described, the outer surface area of the surge arrestors 10 and 10 is subject to non pressurized air.A modification of the second embodiment of the surge arrestor 10 is shown in that it is also mountable off line to the pipes, utilizing the same connecting structure as shown in Figure 5, incl.uding the flange connector 54 of the T connector 64, and the metal. ring 58. The surge arrestor 10 has an elastomeric element 70 made of the same material. as that of the surge arrestors 10 and 10 . The elastomeric element 70, however, has two open ends 71 and 71 , with the end 71 being closed off and sealed by a metal. cap 72.The end 71 is suitably secured to the metal cap 72 by wel.l. known adhesive techniques, to thus form a continuous housing defining an interior hollow chamber for the influx of flowing medium, to thus serve, as the surge arrestor 10 r as a surge accumulator.The metal cap 72 is provided with a central aperture through which extends a valve stem 80 having a threaded portion 80 for mounting the valve stem to the metal. cap via a nut 81, as clearly shown inFigure 6. The valve stem 80 has a tip portion 82 in which is formed a T shaped passageway 84 for allowing fluid connection, when the valve stem is in a sealing position, between the interior of the hollow chamber of the surge arrestor 10 and the interior of the T connector 64, for the reasons to be described below. A metal. plate 52 r similar to metal plate 52 of the surge arrestor 10 , is provided, which metal plate 52 has an opening defining a valve seat 86 for the valve stem tip 82, as clearly shown in Figures 6 and 7. The valve stem 80 serves to close off any influx of flowing medium into the hollow chamber of the surge arrestor after the elastomeric element has expanded to a predetermined point, which ensures continuous duty cycle and liberal safety factors. Thus, the valve stem serves as a safety feature, to prevent overload of the elastomeric element. The threaded portion 80 of the valve stem allows for selected manual extension and retraction of the valve stem, to tailor the surge arrestor to the conditions under which the system will operate, and the forces and surges to which the surge arrestor 10 will be exposed.Figure 6 shows the surge arrestor 10 in its nonexpanded, relaxed condition, when no pressure wave or shock wave has impacted thereon. In this state, valve stem tip 82 is spaced from the seat 86 so that fluid connection is allowed between the hollow interior chamber of the surge arrestor 10 and the interior of the T connector 64, so that when a shock wave or pressure wave is created in the system, as by sudden shut down thereof, the overpressures will be directed to the surge arrestors and absorbed thereby. Figure 7 shows the surge arrestor 10 in its fully expanded condition, when the maximum allowable influx of flowing medium has been reached. As the elastomeric element 70 expands, it shrinks in longitudinal. length, such that its end 71 draws closer to the end 71 thereof.This, in turn, causes the metal cap 72 to approach closer to the seat 86, until, at the critical point, the valve stem tip 82 is forced into seating and sealing engagement with the valve seat opening 86, at which point no further influx of fl.owinq medium is possible. During this sealed state, passageway 84 permits the medium within the chamber of the surge arrestor 10 to flow back into the system slowly, so as to return the surge arrestor 10 to its origina,l, non expanded state shown in Figure 6. This slow return of the medium to the system also helps to prevent additional. shock or pressure waves from accumulating via the feedback from the surge arrestors themselves. The passageway 84 also serves to help equalize the pressure on either side of opening 86, so that the closing of the valve stem tip does not by itself create pressure waves and shock waves, as occurs with the closing of any valve in the piping system. Further, reasonance is effectivelv eliminated. While specific embodiments of the invention have been shown and described, it is to be understood that numerous changes, modifications, and additions may be made thereto without departing from the scope, breadth, and intent of the invention.The features disclosed in the foregoing description, in the claims and or in the accompanying drawings may, both separately and in any combination thereof, be material for realising the invention in diverse forms thereof.
