## Abstract
A process for treating trees and bushes having a xylem structure through which sap passes so as to provide trace elements or micro nutrients selected from calcium, zinc, magnesium, iron, manganese, copper, molybdenum, nickel and boron to the tree or bush, comprising inserting into the xylem structure a solid glass article comprising a phosphate base glass containing the trace elements or micro nutrients in oxide form, the formulation of the phosphate base glass being selected so that the solubility of the phosphate glass in the sap of the tree or shrub being treated is sufficient to provide a transfer of the said trace elements or micro nutrients from the glass into the sap by dissolution of the glass.
