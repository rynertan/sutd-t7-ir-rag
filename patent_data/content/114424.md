## Description
DESCRIPTIONThe invention relates to an apparatus for washing machined workpieces.The various apparatus currently available for washing machined workpieces include those comprising a nozzle mounted on a carriage which can traverse along three mutually orthogonal axes inside the chamber in which the workpiece to be washed is located.The workpiece itself rotates about a vertical axis along which it can also translate, and it can also be rotated through 900 by gripping means in order to enable it to be washed in other planes.This method has various drawbacks.Firstly, such traversing movements of the wash nozzle require a number of carriages slidable on structures incorporating guides corresponding to the axes along which they traverse, and this implies a certain constructional complexity both because of the location and size of said structures and because of the need to apply an individual motor in a perfectly fluid tight manner for each traversing movement of the nozzle, and also to provide means which grip and rotate the workpiece.Moreover, this apparatus does not possess the versatility of application which it should theoretically possess because the stroke of travel of the nozzle along its traversing axis is limited, and it is therefore improbable that every point of the workpiece becomes reached by the jet, especially when the workpiece is complicated and has points of difficult accessibility.To obviate these problems the invention proposes to robotise the nozzle, ie mount it on the arm of a robot, which by possessing a large number of degrees of freedom provides sufficient versatility of application to be able to wash any workpiece when disposed in a certain position, in that the nozzle or rather the robot to which it is fitted is able to vary its angle and to position itself at the necessary points, even those of most difficult access.Even though not essential in certain cases, it is sufficient for the workpiece to rotate about a vertical axis and to swivel about a horizontal axis in order for it to be completely washed at all points. The relative movement between the workpiece and nozzle, which is controlled and programmed by means of a numerical control system, enables the relative paths of travel to be optimised, thus also reducing washing times.These and further objects which will be more apparent hereinafter are attained according to the invention by an apparatus for washing machined workpieces, comprising a wash chamber for the workpiece in which the workpiece is positioned on a table mobile in such 2 manner as to orientate the various faces of the workpiece in front of a wash nozzle, characterised in that the nozzle is mounted on a robot which is controlled by a numerical control system, the robot being constituted by a set of mutually hinged arms of such a number as to enable the nozzle to undergo a sequence of spatial movements sufficient to enable it to reach every part of the workpiece to be washed.A preferred embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention is described hereinafter by way of non limiting example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a plan view of the apparatus Figure 2 is a section on the linP II II of Figure 1.The workpiece to be washed, either mounted on a pallet or freestanding, is fed along a roller table 10 and enters a first prewash chamber 11 comprising, in known manner, a rotary drum 12 in which the workpiece is positioned such that a set of fixed peripheral nozzles, each of which feeds a low pressure wash water jet, effects a first rough washing of the workpiece. This latter then passes through a door 13 and into the wash cabin 14 until it becomes positioned on the table 15, which is described hereinafter. After washing, the workpiece passes trough a second door 16, thus leaving the wash chamber 14 to enter the chamber in which the workpiece is dried, and which is also provided with a rotary drum 18 together with a set of nozzles which feed air on to the workpiece rotating in the drum.The workpiece, now dry and cleaned of all impurities, proceeds along its path towards the next station.The wash chamber 14 is shown in Figure 2. It comprises walls 19, a roof 21 and a floor 20 in which there is an aperture 23 for discharging the water and the swarf removed from the washed workpiece.The roof 21 supports the wash robot 22 which comprises a first arm 24 rotating about a vertical axis x. To the arm 24 there is hinged at 26, about an axis y, a second arm 25 which carries, hinged to its end at 27 about an axis z, a third arm 28. Hinged to the other end of this latter about an axis w at 29 there is the arm 30 which carries the nozzle 31, this latter being hinged about an axis k to said arm 30.A controlled wash robot is thus formed having five degrees of freedom. The workpiece 32 is itself positioned on a table 33 provided with suitable devices for positioning and locking the work holding pallet or the workpiece itself if free standing, and rotating about the vertical axis a and swivelling about the horizontal axis b in order to dispose each face of the workpiece in front of the nozzle 31.The apparatus formed in this manner operates by virtue of relative movements between the robot 22 and workpiece 32, these movements being controlled and programmed by means of a numerical control system which programs the various movements in relation to the workpiece to be washed, ie in relation to its dimensions, configuration and geometrical characteristics.For simplicity, numerical control for the rotary and swivel movements of the table 33 can be dispensed with for its positioning, in that the control and programming of the robot is sufficient in itself to provide the necessary movements to the nozzle 31 to allow its access to every part of the workpiece 32. Again for simplicity, the number of degrees of freedom of the robot 22 can be less than five for washing simpler workpieces or if the robot 22 is mounted on the vertical line passing through the workpiece or in any other position which simplifies its access to all parts of the workpiece to be washed. The actuator members for the robot 22 are not described as these are of conventional type, ie usual in any application in which a numerical control system controls a member disposed at the end of articulated arms, whether this be a nozzle as in this case, or any other type of member for a specific application.
