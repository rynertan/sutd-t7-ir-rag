# Reel for a life line.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a reel for a life line comprising a frame 5 , a winding member 3 journalled in said frame so as to be rotatable about a rotary axis, damping means connected on the one hand with the frame 5 and on the other hand with the winding member 3 and counteracting the rotation of the winding member 3 said damping means comprising at least one cam member 27 and a plurality of piston pumps 35 rotatably co operating herewith along a relative path of movement with respect to one another and each having a cylinder 40 and a piston 39 displaceable therein and being in contact wtth the cam member 27 , whilst of each pair of pumps 35 , whose pistons 39 are moved in opposite senses by the cam member 27 , the cylinders 40 communicate with one another through a channel 45 having a restriction. In order to provide a reel capable of providing powerful damp ing, which is nevertheless compact, the reel comprises one set of pumps having a plurality of pump pairs which co operate with the cam member along one and the same rela tive path of movement and which communicate each with a common channel 46 portion through a restriction.
