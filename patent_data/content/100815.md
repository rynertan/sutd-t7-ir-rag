# N 1,3 dithiolan 2 ylidene anilines and their use as anti inflammatory and anti asthmatic agents.

## Abstract
N 1,3 dithiolan 2 ylidene 4 alkylanilines are useful as anti inflammatory agents, as analgesic agents and as anti asthmatic agents. The compounds involved can be prepared by the reaction of an appropriate 4 alkylaniline with a methyl 1,3 dithiolan 2 ylidene sulfonium salt or with carbon disulfide and ethylene dibromide in the presence of a base.
