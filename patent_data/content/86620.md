## Description
POLYMERIC COMPOSITIONS SUITABLE FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF FOAMED ARTICLES, AND A PROCESS FOR PREPARING THE SAME This invention relates to polymeric compositions suitable for the manufacture of foamed articles, and to a process for preparing the same. More particularly the invention relates to a process for preparing foamed articles based on mixes of a cross linked elastomer with a thermoplastics olefinic polymer.Processes for preparing similar articles are known, which consist in preparing a mix of a rubber of the non cross linked EPDM type with an olefinic polymer together with cross linking and foaming agents, and in vulcanizing in a press the article prepared from such mix, thus obtaining a foamed article as a consequence of the action of the foaming agent at the vulcanizing temperature.Such processes have the drawback of requiring very long vulcanization times, and of providing articles of relatively high density, equal to or higher than 0.2 g cc.The present invention in one aspect provides a polymeric composition suitable for the manufacture of foamed articles, comprising a mixture of a foaming agent with a dynamically vulcanized mix of an EPDM rubber, or of an ethylene propylene elastomeric copolymer, with 5 95 by weight, referred to the said mix, of a thermoplastics olefinic polymer.The invention in another aspect provides a process for preparing a polymeric composition suitable for the manufacture of foamed articles, comprising subjecting to dynamic vulcanization a mix including an elastomer, composed of an SPDM rubber or of an ethylene propylene copolymer, and a thermoplastics olefinic polymer in an amount of from 5 to 95 by weight referred to the mix with the elastomer, and then adding a foaming agent to the said mix at a temperature lower than the tempera ture at which the said foaming agent becomes active.The process according to the invention permits foamed articles to be obtained which have a particuiarly low density, at high production rates, such process comprising subjecting to dynamic vulcanization a mix composed of an elastomer of an ethylene propylene copolymer or of an SPDM rubber, with from 5 to 95 by weight, in the mix with the elastomer, of an olefinic thermoplastics polymer, and a vulcanizing agent for such elastomer, then adding to the mix so vulcanized a foaming agent, at a temperature of the mix lower than the temperature at which such foaming agent becomes active, and then bringing the mix containing the foaming agent to the temperature at which such agent becomes active, with formation of a foamed shaped body.The mixture of the foaming agent with the plasto elastomeric mix of vulcanized elastomer and olefinic polymer can be subjected to grinding, prior to the foaming step, and directly marketed as such. phe dynamic vulcanization of the mix of elastomer with the olefinic,polymer is accomplished according to known techniques as are described, for example, in US PatentNos. 3 758 643, 3 862 106, 3 037 954, and 3 806 558, in French Patent No. 2 408 632, and in Italian PatentApplication No. 24213 A 80 in the name of the presentApplicants, by employing vulcanizing agents in amounts ranging from 0 05 to 10 , but preferably from 0.1 to 8 , by weight referred to the elastomer.As vulcanizing agents it is possible to use all those which are known for the vulcanization of the EPDM rubbers and of the ethylene propylene elastomeric copolymers, e.g. peroxides, phenolic resins, sulphur and sulphur donors, isocyanates, sulphonated compounds, and radiations.Mixing of the plasto elastomeric mix with the foaming agent can be carried out by incorporation of the latter into the mix which is in the plastic or softened state, for example by conveying the components between two rollers maintained at a temperature sufficient to soften the polymeric mass, but not such as to activate the foaming agent. The resulting mixture can be then granulated, and the granules can be used for manufacturing the foamed shaped articles through heating in proper press moulds. It is also possible to achieve such mixing simply by adding the foaming agent to the granules of the plasto elastomeric mix, operating in suitable Banbury mixers or in compounding screw mixers, so that the foaming agent can adhere to the granule surface.As EPDM rubbers there are preferably used those containing from 20 to 70 by weight of propylene and from 0.5 to 20 , more preferably from 1 to 10 , by weight of a dienic monomer, combined together, calculated on the terpolymer weight.Dienic monomers which can be present in the rubber are, for example, 1,4 hexadiene 2 metnyl 1,4 pentadiene 1,4,9 decatriene 1,5 cyclooctadiene 1,4 cyclopenta diene dicyclopentadiene ethylidene norbornene and the substitution derivatives of such monomers.As thermoplastics olefinic polymer present in the mix with the EPDM rubber or with the ethylene propylene elastomeric copolymer, it is possible to use the polymers obtained by polymerization of one or more monoolefins by processes at low or high pressure, such as for example low or high density polyethylenes, polypropylene, polybutene l, poly 4 methylpentene 1, poly hexene, poly 5 methyl I hexene, and poly 3 methyl 1 pentene. The foaming agent is preferably added to the plastomeric mix coming from the dynamic vulcanization in an amount ranging from 0.5 to 10 by weight referred to the total weight of the mixture with such mix. Suitable foaming agents are those compounds capable of releasing, at a temperature between 1000 and 250 C, but preferably between 1300 and 2500C, a gas which is inert towards the polymers contained in the mix, such as nitrogen, oxygen or carbon dioxide. Compounds of such kind are, for example, nitrogen compounds, nitrous derivatives, derivatives of sulphonylhydrazine s, and bicarbonate S. A preferred general method of preparing the compositions of the present invention comprises subjecting to mixing, in a Banbury mixer, during 2 10 minutes, the elastomeric component, the plastomer and the cross linking agent at a temperature ranging from about 1200 to 2200C at the conclusion of the mixing step, i.e. when cross linking has been achieved, the polymeric mass, which retains good processability characteristics, is discharged and cooled down to a temperature of about 11000, and at such temperature the foaming agent is added thereto.The amount of cross linking agent to be utilized in such operation will vary as a function of its chemical nature, such amount being chosen so as to obtain, once the action of the cross linking agent is exhausted, a vulcanized polymeric mass still processable to be homogeneously mixed with the foaming agent. The resulting mixture can be granulated and the granules can be used to prepare articles, which are obtained by heating in compression or injection presses or by feeding the granules to an extruder at the temperature at which the foaming agent becomes active.The foamed products obtained from such mixtures or compositions have a density from 0.02 to 0.2 g cm3, and a cellular structure with porous or microporous cells which are isolated from, or hardly communicating with, one another. At the same time, they possess the same good elastic properties and may be manufactured, along various possible articles, into foamed drawn articles, moulded sheets and articles obtainable according to moulding or drawing techniques.The invention will be further described with reference to the following illustrative Examples.EXAMPLESInto an internal mixer for rubbers of the Banbury type, having a capacity of 13 liters, there were introduced an elastomeric component, a plastomeric component and a vulcanizing agent, of the type and in the amount by weight grams as indicated in Table 1 below.During mixing and vulcanization, the conditions in the mixer were as follows initial temperature of the mixer .... 100 110 C speed of the two rotors thereof .... 60 rpm and 50 rpm, respectively temperature after 7 minutes .... 210 230 C dwell of the mix at 210 230 C .... I minute.The mix was then discharged from the Banbury mixer and conveyed into an open mixer, where it was cooled, additioned with a foaming agent, mixed with the latter during 7 9 minutes, and finally cooled to room temperature 220C . The mix so obtained was granulated by aSAGITTA cold cutter, and the granules were utilized for the preparation of manufactured articles by feeding them into compression or injection presses or into extruders, and by operating under temperature and time conditions suited to foaming, as indicated in Table 1.For the characterization of the mix components and of the products, the following methods were employedM.I. for polyethylene Standards ASTM D 1238 E for polypropylene Standards ASTM D 1238 LSpecific gravity Standards BS 903, part.F1 F9 Unitary load Standards ASTM D 1056 68Shore hardness type OO Standards ASTM D 2240 68Water absorption Standards ASTM D 470 68 Table 1EXAMPLES EMI9.1 1 SEP 2 SEP 3 SEP 4 SEP 5 SEP 6 SEP 7 SEP 8 SEP 9 SEP 10 SEP 11 SEP 12 SEP 13 SEP 14 tb tb Elastomer tb A SEP .........................................
