## Description
This invention relates to an electrolytic capacitor containing a tetrafluoroborate of an organic amine compound dissolved in an aprotic solvent, and also to an electrolyte for use in an electrolytic capacitor. Hitherto, organic acids or their salts and glycol series pastes have been principally used as electrolytes for electrolytic capacitors for general purposes. The latest expansion in utilization of electronic instruments requires further improvements in the reliability and performance of capacitors which at present suffer from the presence of undesired water in the paste and as a result an electrolyte utilising an aprotic solvent in place of an organic acid and a salt thereof and glycol paste has become attractive. The greatest obstacle to the employment of an aprotic solvent system electrolyte is the difficulty of obtaining an electrolyte of high conductivity and to achieve this an organic carboxylic acid or salt thereof which are highly soluble in aprotic solvents and which display a high degree of dissociation have been studied but success has not yet been achieved. To solve this problem and obtain a solvent with high conductivity a solvent has been tried which produces water by the reaction between an acid and an alcohol or glycol so that water is incorporated into the aprotic solvent, but this has not achieved sufficient conductivity and the resulting solvent exhibits poor reliability at elevated temperature as disclosed in the Japanese patent publications Nos. 55 3989, 57 56763, 58 32769 and the U.S. Patent No. 4,117,531. After extensive research with a view to obtaining an electrolyte which is substantially nonaqueous and has a high conductivity with use of an aprotic solvent but without using any solvent in which water is formed by reaction between acids and alcohols or glycols, we have discovered that an organic amine salt of a tetrafluoroborate has a high solubility in aprotic solvents with enhanced dissociation and displays high conductivity. According to one feature of the invention we provide an electrolytic capacitor containing a tetrafluoroborate of an organic amine compound as a solute dissolved in an aprotic solvent. According to another feature of the invention we provide an electrolyte for an electrolytic capacitor, wherein said organic amine compound comprises i a compound containing one or two pyridine rings or ii a primary, secondary or tertiary amine or a quaternary ammonium compound in which in group ii to a nitrogen atom are bonded four groups selected from 1 to 4 alkyl groups, an alkenyl group or an aryl group and 1 to 3 hydrogen atoms. The organic amine compounds for use in the capacitor of the invention preferably contain one or two pyridine rings, as follows Further, the organic amine compound for use in the invention may be selected from primary, secondary and tertiary amines and quaternary ammonium compounds in which to the nitrogen atom are added 1 to 4 alkyl groups or alkenyl groups having 1 to 15 carbons, or aryl groups having 6 to 15 carbons and 1 to 3 hydrogen atoms, for example Moreover, the organic amine compound for use in the invention may be selected from compounds having the general formula in which n is 0 to 1, m n is 2 or 3, R1 is presence or absence of an alkyl substituent having up to 3 carbon atoms, and R is hydrogen or an N heterocyclic di condensed ring compound in which the nitrogen atom forms a tertiary amine or a quaternary ammonium with one or two alkyl groups having 1 to 5 carbon atoms and up to 5 conjugated double bonds are contained in the ring The aprotic solvent to be used in the invention may be selected from the following but is not limited thereto The invention will now be illustrated by way of non limiting examples An electrolyte for an electrolytic capacitor according to the invention and utilising a 10 by weight solution of tetrafluoroborates of various organic amine compounds was tested with respect to conductivity and sparking voltage as shown in Table 1. Results obtained at 25V 1 micro F for the electrolytes shown in examples 1 to 12 are given in Table 2. Electrolytes for electrolytic capacitors according to the invention with a 10 by weight solution of tetrafluoroborates of various N heterocyclic di condensed ring compounds were tested with respect to conductivity, as shown in Table 3. Further, as comparative examples results obtained with a conventional standard electrolyte composed of 78 by weight of ethyleneglycol, 12 by weight of water and 10 by weight of ammonium adipate are shown in Table 3. The characteristics over a period of time of the electrolytes shown in Examples 13 to 24 and the comparative example are shown in Table 4. The electrolytes according to the invention are non aqueous electrolytes having a high conductivity, equivalent to or greater than that of conventional electrolytes composed of glycols, water and organic acid salts, with improved applicability in electrolytic capacitors.
