# Guarded superconductive circuit.

## Abstract
In superconductive circuitry including a superconduct ing ground plane 18 , a magnetic flux trapping moat 24 is provided which surrounds a superconductive device I . The moat is preferably a cut through the superconducting ground plane which extends along a perimeter surrounding the superconducting device, the moat being continuous except for small regions 26 where there is no cut. The small regions serve as current carrying portions to link the ground plane within the moat to the rest of the ground plane outside of the moat. The moat is a flux pinning center so that magnetic flux does not enter the ground plane region located near the superconducting device.
