# A light radiator.

## Abstract
A light radiator for diffusing and radiating light rays, transmitted through an optical cable or the like, outside of the optical conductor cable. The radiator is comprised of a transparent cylinder 10₁ 10₂ an optical conductor 20₁ 20₂ for guiding light rays into the cylinder, an optical means 30₁ 30₂ movably accommodated in the cylinder for reflect ing and radiating the light rays, and a driving means for moving the optical means along the axis direction of the cylinder. The driving means is comprised of first and second liquid pumps h0₁ h0₂ comprising of a piston cylinder 40
