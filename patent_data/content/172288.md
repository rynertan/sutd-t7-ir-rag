# The use of polymeric alkylenephosphoric acid piperazine derivatives for scale control in flue gas desulfurization.

## Abstract
An improvement in a process for flue gas desulfurization in which new polymers which are the reaction product of N aminoethylpiperazine and a dihalo or epoxyhalo com pound, which are subsequently phosphonomethylated, are employed as threshold agents, prevent calcium scale forma tion in the contacting section but permit precipitation of calcium compounds at a later stage.
