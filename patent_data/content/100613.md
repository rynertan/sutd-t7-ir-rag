# Signal distribution networks.

## Abstract
A signal distribution network has a number of local service centres 11 13, 21 24 connected to main service centres 1,2 which are interconnected by a regional network 3,4 . Communication between a local service centre e.g. 11 and its associated customer outlets 32 is by way of a unidirectional transmission path 30 which originates and terminates at the local switching centre 11 . Each customer outlet 32 is arranged to receive broadcast signals on some of the signalling channels and signals individual to that outlet 32 on certain other signals. Dedicated signals received on a channel from the local service centre 11 may be inhibited at the selected customer outlet 32 and substituted by signals generated by customer apparatus.

## Description
The present invention relates to signal distribution networks and more particularly, but not exclusively, to such networks for distributing signals defining television pictures. The Government of the United kingdom is expected to permit the installation of a distribution network for cable television in the near future on the condition that the network is financed by private capital. The least expensive method of providing such a network is by way of a transmission path having tapping points to which customers apparatus may be connected and upon which signals are broadcast . Such a system does not permit the network to be used efficiently other than for broadcast signalling since relative to the message channel period, long guard periods must be introduced to permit transmitted signals to reach the furthest point of the network. In order to permit signalling by the customer apparatus on the network, either in response to signals received from a service centre or at the customer s volition, it is current practice to provide an individual transmission path from the service centre to each customer outlet. The cost of providing such a network is likely to prove prohibitive to private investors seeking to recoup the capital cost from revenue in a reasonable period of time. It is an object of the present invention to provide a signal distribution network capable of providing both unidirectional broadcast signalling and bi directional signalling without providing an individual transmission path between the service centre and each customer outlet. The term local service centre as used herein means apparatus for sending or receiving signals to or from a number of customer outlets. The term main service centre as used herein means apparatus for sending or receiving signals to or from a number of local service centres. A main service centre may be connected to other main service centres and may also provide the facilities of a local service centre. According to the present invention in a signal distribution network having a plurality of local service centres as hereinbefore defined each directly connected to a main service centre as hereinbefore defined by a two way transmission path, each of said local service centres is connected to a respective plurality of customer outlets by a respective unidirectional transmission path in the form of a loop having each of its ends connected at the respective local service centre, eachf said unidirectional transmission paths having a plurality of signalling channels multiplexed thereon, at least some of said channels being frequency division multiplexed channels and arranged to carry signals available at every customer outlet and at least some others of said channels being time division multiplexed channels and arranged to carry signal individual to a respective customer outlet to which such a signal is addressed. Preferably said frequency division multiplexed FDM channels carry signals defining television pictures and some of said FDM channels may also be arranged to carry signals individual to a respective addressed customer outlet. The customer outlets may be arranged, when addressed as aforesaid by a signal on one of said FDM channels to inhibit further progress of the signals received on that channel from the respective local service centre and to substitute signals if any on said channel for transmission to the local service centre. Alternatively the customer outlets may be arranged when so addressed to transmit signals on a different one of said FDM channels. The unidirectional transmission paths may be optical fibre or co axial cable whilst the two way transmission path may be optical fibre, co axial cable or a radio link. A plurality of local service centres may be connected together by a unidirectional transmission path which may be arranged such that signals between a first local service centre and a second local service centre are transmitted by way of said unidirectional path and signals between the second local service centre and the first local service centre are by way of the transmission path to a main service centre. A signal distribution network in accordance with the invention will now be described, by way of example onlya with reference to the accompanying drawings of which Figure 1 is a block diagram of a part of such a network and Figure 2 is a schematic channel distribution. Referring to Figure 1 the network has a number of main service centres only two of which are shown 1, 2 each of which is connected to the other main service centres 1, 2 either directly by a transmission path 3 or indirectly by way of a transmission path 4 to other service centres not shown in a hierarchy. The transmission paths 3 and 4 are low loss two way paths and may be for example co axial cables, optical fibres, four wire circuits or radio links with suitable balancing and amplifying circuits not shown . Teach of the main service centres 1, 2 is connected to a number of local service centres only some of which are shown 11 to 13 and 21 to 24 by respective two way transmission paths 15 15 to 17, 17 and 25, 25 to 28, 28 . As thus far described there is little difference between the network of the invention and a conventional telephone network. However, to provide a facility described hereinafter in the present network a respective unidirectional transmission path 19,29 connects each of the main service centres 1, 2 with all of its respective local service centres 11 13 and 21 24 It is here noted that whilst the unidirectional transmission paths 19, 29 are separately shown they may be dedicated channels of the respective two way tranmission paths. Since the networks in the hierarchy below the main services centres 1, 2 are substantially identical it is convenient to describe only the network associated with the main service centre 1 and to note that each of the main service centres 1, 2 and their respective local service centres 11 13 and 21 24 function in a similar manner. Each of the local service centres 11 13 has a respective transmission path 30 in the form of a loop having each of its ends at that service centre. The transmission paths 30 include a number of unidirectional repeater amplifiers 31 thus ensuring transmission in the reverse direction is substantially eliminated. A number of customer outlets 32 are tapped off the transmission paths 30 wherever they may be required for connection to the customer apparatus. The transmission paths 30 may be for example co axial cable, twisted pair cable or multiple optical fibres. It may be convenient for certain customer outlets which are distant from one of the local service centres say 12 to receive signals on a transmission path 33 which originates at the local service centre 12 and terminates at the local service centre 13. In this case the transmission path loop is completed by way of the transmission path I7 , the main service centre 1 and the transmission path 16. A suitable distribution plan for the service centres includes having a main service centre 1 serving a number of local service centres 11 13 distributed in a radius of, say, one to ten kilometres. Thus the main service centre 1 would serve an area similar to that catered for by a conventional telephone exchange having between 5,000 and 20,000 customers. The local service centres 11 to 13 may conveniently be housed in a street cabinet and would each provide a service to a maximum of, say, 1,000 customer outlets in a radius of, say, one half kilometre from the service centre. Referring also to Figure 2 the mode of operation of the transmission path 30 will now be considered. On the transmission path 30 frequencies in the rangeO to 60 megaherts referred to hereinafter as the baseband are used to provide telephony and telemetry channels.The baseband has a digital capacity of some 30 megabits per second and may carry some 250 two way sixty four kilobit per second channels or fifteen two way viewphone channels. In the prior system discussed in the opening paragraphs the number of two way channels provided by the baseband is considerahly reduced since, assuming that go and return pulse bursts are used a guard period must be interposed between the go and return channels to prevent signal overlapping. The guard period must be as long as ar longer than the longest period taken for a single pulse burst to travel from end to end of the transmission path. In the present system the guard period is reduced to exceed the longest period for a signal to travel the transmission path 30 between the two most distantly spaced repeater amplifiers 31. A telephony system using a unidirectional transmission path in the form of a loop is disclosed in our copending Patent Application No. 8011068 published serial No. 2047 048A . The advantages of such a system will be readily appreciated by reference to that application. In the present network the capacity of the transmission system above the baseband hereinafter referred to as the broadband is used firstly to provide a number of broadcast television channels and secondly to provide a number of high quality two way viewphone links. In the broadband up to fifty frequency division multiplexed FDM channels may be made available. These channels may be used either for broadcasting that is they are available to all of the customer outlets 32 or pairs of channels may be used to provide a two way viewphone link of better quality than vi one links using the baseband channels. It will also be appreciated that the broadband channels may be used to provide high speed data transmission service. In order that the available capacity of the transmission path 30 may be more efficiently used each of the tapping points for the customer outlets 32 may be provided with a band stop filter s . If a unidirectional repeater amplifier 31 including a band stop filter is provided at each of the customer outlets 32 then, since there will be no backward transmission at all the small guard period of the baseband channels may be eliminated. Similarly since broadband channel signals received from the local service centre 1 may be prevented from continuing on the transmission path 30 the two way viewphone links may be provided using a single channel with the signal transmitted from the local service centre 1 being replaced at the appropriate customer outlet 32 with a signal generated by apparatus at that outlet. In operation, the main service centre 1 will receive digital data from the regional network by way of the transmission path 4 and will identify from the data received which channels are for broadcast purposes. These broadcast channels are re assembled in time division multiplex and transmitted by way of the transmission path 19 to all of the local service centres 11 to 13. Digital data channels received at the main service centre 1 for two way communication will be passed to the appropriate one of the local service centres 11 13 say 11 where it is further processed to determine the customer outlet 32 for which it is intended. The local service centre 11 combines the broadcast channels and dedicated channels, viewphone channels inFDM in the broadband and retransmits the dedicated telemetry or telephony channels in T.D.M. in the baseband on the transmission path 30. It will be appreciated that the services provided by the broadcast channels may include television and radio transmission and, in combination with data or time controlled domestic video recorders, an electronic video library service. The two way channels may be used for low speed two way data transmission for telemetering for example in connection with charging for energy consumption, burglar and fire alarms and the like. The broadband channels being capable of offering higher speed data transmission may also be used for example with viewdata services such as the Prestel service of British Telecom. Each of the channels available on the transmission path 30 may also be used to provide a two way viewphone service.
