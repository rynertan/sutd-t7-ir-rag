## Description
Process for the continuous manufacture of phenolic foam layers and installation applying said process .This invention relates to a process for the continuous manufacture of layers of isolating material, especially phenolic foam, as well as to installations applying said process, the main object of the invention being the manufacture of an uninflammable foam product presenting enormous advantages both as a thermal and a sound absorbing isolating material with respect to the materials of the prior art, which are inflammable and mostly generate a toxic gas.It is known that the addition of a phenolic resin to liquid freon and an acid results in an exothermic reaction wherein a gas is generated occasioning foaming whereby an amount of heat is formed whose temperature is one of the determining factors for the intensity with which curing of the foam takes place.It is also known that mixing of the phenolic resin with freon and an acid according to the prior art is very poor, which is mainly due to the high viscosity of the resin whereby foam formation and curing cannot be controlled.So, this invention relates to a process and an installation applying said process, whereby the aforesaid and other disadvantages which are an impediment in the formation of phenolic foam isolating layers, can be obviated. The Applicant has found indeed that for suitably mixing the phenolic resin, the liquid freon and the acid it is advantageous to use compressed air and thereafter to subject the mixture obtained to a second mixing treatment.Whereas the first mixing treatment is realized by introducing the compressed air into a mixing chamber together with phenolic resin, freon and acid, the second mixing treatment is performed mechanically, e.g. by providing mixing elements in said mixing chamber.The Applicant has also found that in order to make the gas evolution proceed suitably, the temperature of the mixture should be kept under control, the latter generally consisting in either cooling the products supplied to the mixing chamber within appropriate limits, or cooling said mixing chamber and or channels through which the mixture should move before leaving the nozzle, wherein for that purpose a jacket is provided round at least a part of the mixing chamber and optionally round the pipes wherein a fluid is circulated, or some combination of the aforementioned possibilities. The object always is to maintain the mixing chamber at a temperature situated between well determined limits, e.g. between 200C and 400C. The process according to the present invention showing the aforementioned and other advantages mainly consists in bringing together phenolic resin, freon, an acid, e.g. sulphuric acid, and compressed air in order to obtain a first mixture of the compounds mentioned subjecting said mixture to an additional or second mixing treatment, e.g. a mechanical mixing treatment, and maintaining the temperature of this mixture between well determined limits in order to control foaming.The invention also relates to an installation applying the above mentioned process, said installation being mainly for med by a mixing chamber which at its bottom is provided with a discharge terminating in a nozzle, said mixing chamber being provided with a supply for phenolic resin, freon, an acid, mostly sulphuric acid, and compressed air, wherein in this mixing chamber additional mechanical mixing means and at least round a part of the mixing chamber means are provided that allow the temperature of the mixture to be maintained between well defined limits.In order to better show the characteristics of the present invention a possible embodiment of an installation applying the process of the present invention is described by way of an example without limiting the scope thereof.This installation is represented in the accompanying figure and mainly consists in a mixing chamber 1 wherein, in this case, four pipes 2 to 5 run, which e.g. are intended for the introduction of phenolic resin, freon, acid and compressed air into the mixing chamber.In the mixing chamber 1 are mixing elements 6, which in this embodiment are formed by a rod 7 to which stirring pegs 8 are fixed.Rod 7 carrying the stirring pegs 8 is driven by a suitable motor 9, e.g. a hydraulic motor.Underneath, the mixing chamber 1 is extended by a conduit 10, which ends in an appropriate nuzzle 11.According to the invention the mixing chamber is provided at least round its upper part with a jacket 12 sQ ag to form a chamber 13 that is connected to an inlet 14 and an outlet 15.As already appears from the foregoing it sufficea to introduce the phenolic resin, the freon, the íd, e.g. sulphuric acid, and compressed air in the suitable ratio into the mixing chamber 1 for achieving that, as a result of the presence of the compressed air, a first efficient mixing of the afore mentioned components takes place, a second mixing occurring almost simultaneously under the influence of the mixing means 6, which are actuated by the motor 9.Meeting of the above mentioned components in the mixing chamber 1 causes an exothermic reaction, the heat set free thereby being controlled by the circulation of a fluid in said chamber 13.Although the purpose of said fluid mostly is one of cooling, it is not excluded to convert it. into a heating fluid.Actually, the general purpose of this fluid is to maintain the mixture at a temperature situated between well determined limits so as to keep the formation of heat and hence the formation of foam under control and to avoid any deleterious curing in the mixing chamber.It is clear that the embodiment represented in the figure is intended to be the basic representation. Indeed, the supply pipes 2 to 5, e.g., can be arranged according to any other configuration, As a matter of fact, an advantageous embodiment is formed by a supply line of sulphuric acid into which the compressed air line ends, two outlets starting from the supply line of sulphuric acid, one of which ending in the supply line of phenolic resin and the other into the supply line of freon liquid, the latter lines terminating separately or together into the mixing chamber 1. It is also possible, optionally in combination with the mentioned jacket 12, to mount a chamber 16 round one or more supply lines 2 to 5 to which lines 17 18 are connected and wherein, as is the case with a jacket 12, in this chamber a fluid can circulate bringing one or more of the components of the mixture to a suitable temperature so as to control the exothermic reaction of said different components.Evidently, still other modifications are possible without departing from the scope of the invention.
