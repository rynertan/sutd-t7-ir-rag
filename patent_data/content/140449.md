# Surface acoustic wave device.

## Abstract
A low insertion loss surface acoustic wave filter in which withdrawal weighted launching and output transducers 20, 40 are acoustically coupled by two high efficiency reflective multistrip couplers 6, 6 . To reduce the insertion loss, the inner bus bars 21, 41, are reduced in width so as to reduce the dead space 12 in the coupler. This makes it impossible to form a reliable wire bond connection to the inner bus bars which are therefore connected via a conducting path across the propagation path at the ends of the transducers. Further reduction in the widths of the inner bus bars and consequent increase in resistive losses are offset by several connections to a further bus 23, 43 via groups 25 of dummy electrodes arranged at null points in the weighting pattern.
