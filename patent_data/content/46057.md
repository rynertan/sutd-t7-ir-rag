# Corrosion inhibitors, methods of producing them and protective coatings containing them.

## Abstract
Corrosion inhibiting particles comprise an inorganic oxide which is silica or alumina, having corrosion inhibiting cations, particularly calcium or zinc cations, chemically bound to the particles. They may be prepared by contacting a silica or alumina containing hydroxyl groups with an alkaline solution containing the cations, at ambient temperature. The corrosion inhibiting particles may be incorporated into protective coatings, e.g paints based on epoxy resins, alkyd resins, vinyl resins or chlorinated rubbers, in amounts up to 80 wt based on dry film weight, giving coatings with up to 7.2 wt corrosion inhibiting cations. Release of the cations is by ion exchange with other cations, e.g the alkali metal cations of sea water, and does not, as is normal with corrosion inhibiting coatings, depend on the water solubility of the corrosion inhibitor.
