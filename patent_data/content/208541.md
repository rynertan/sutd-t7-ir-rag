## Description
This invention relates to fluid compositions suitable for use in traction drives. Traction drive devices such as of ball cone, cone ring, wheel disc, chain sieve, toroidal and planetary roll types are designed to operate with power transmission that takes advantage of the rolling friction which develops as a result of a film of oil being hardened at the contacting surfaces. In general, lubricating oils for use in those traction drives should meet the following requirements. Known traction fluids are satisfactory in part, not in whole of the above requirements. Various additives have been proposed to compensate for the missing qualities. However, the use of such additives has in many instances resulted in reduced fatigue life of traction wheels, bearings and gears and also reduced traction coefficient. It has now been found that fluid compositions of superior characteristics can be obtained for use in traction drives which incorporate a selected class of hydrocarbon compounds combined with certain dialkyldithio zinc phosphates, alkenyl succinimides or their boron derivatives, and carboxylates of polyalcohols. It is therefore the primary object of the present invention to provide improved traction fluid compositions which are capable of providing traction drive apparatus with prolonged fatigue life, high wear resistance, high traction coefficient, high oxidation and shear stability, rust proofness and other characteristics desired to attain best traction performance.

Smaller amounts than 0.1 wt. would fail to give sufficient wear resistance and oxidation stability. Greater amounts than 5 wt. would result in reduced rolling fatigue life and traction coefficient. Alkenyl succinimides and their boron derivatives are useful as component II in the invention. The alkenyl succinimides may be obtained by reaction of polyolefins with maleic anhydride and by subsequent conversion of the resulting intermediates into the form of imides by reaction with amines. Examples of the polyolefins are those resulting from the homo and co polymerization of olefins of 2 30 carbon atoms such as ethylene, propylene, butene, pentene, hexene, heptene, octene, nonene, decene and dodecene, and also from the co polymerization of those olefins with aromatic olefins such as styrene.

The amount of component II to be added should be in the range of 0.1 5 wt. , preferably 0.5 3 wt. , based on the total composition.

The amount of component IV to be added should be in the range of 0.1 20 wt. , preferably 1 10 wt. , based on the total composition. Smaller amounts than 0.1 wt. would be ineffective for viscosity buildup. Greater amounts than 20 wt. would lead to reduced traction coefficient.
