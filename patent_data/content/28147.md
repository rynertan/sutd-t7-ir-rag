# Electro optical light transmission controlling panel.

## Abstract
Infrared reflecting electrochromic light controlling panel comprising, successively in a laminated structure, a first transparent plate 1 of glass or plastics, a transparent electroconductive film 2 , an interlayer 3 of a polymer electrolyte, a first tungsten oxide film 4 , an infra red reflecting and electroconductive metal film 5 , a second tungsten oxide film 6 and a second transparent plate 7 . The first tungsten oxide film 4 is colored when a negative voltage is applied across it. The panel can be used as an infra red reflecting window which regulates the transmis sion of visible light and solar energy by applying an electric field to the first tungsten oxide film. The voltage applied can be varied in response to changes in the intensity of incident light.
