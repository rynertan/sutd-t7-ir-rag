# Tapered thickness chord ratio wing.

## Abstract
A swept wing 10 for jet transports having a thickness chord length t c ratio that continuously decreases i.e., tapers from the wing root 14 to the wing tip 16 is disclosed. The tapered t c ratio wing has reduced weight and improved overall efficiency when compared to conventional, constant t c ratio wings. While the t c ratio of the wing tapers, the combined structural and skin strength of the wing remains adequate to handle bending loads imposed by lift and engine weight. In this regard, the cross sectional thickness of the midspan region of the wing is choosen such that the wing skin thickness can be reduced to the minimum allowable for the skin material. Also, the cross sectional thickness of the outboard region of the wing is decreased, resulting in decreased drag and weight in this region. Further, the camber of the outboard portion of the wing is increased as compared to the camber of a constant t c ratio wing to prevent the unsweeping of spanwise oriented isobars 54 .

## Description
TAPERED THICKNESS CHORD RATIO WING Background of the Invention This invention relates to wings, and more particularly, to transonic wings. The majority of transonic wings currently in use have thicknesschord length t c ratios, i.e., the ratio of wing thickness to chord length, that begins at a maximum value adjacent the side of the fuselage and rapidly decreases in the outward wing direction to approximately 30 sernispan. Beyond the 30 semispan location, the tic ratio is approximately constant. This tic ratio distribution allows the outboard portion of the wing which is the most important portion in terms of critical mach number to be desigiied using a relatively simple two dimensional airfoil technique, which takes into necount tic effects of wing sweep and planform taper. While wings having a constant tic ratio from the 30YÓ semispan location to the wii g tip are relatively easy to design, such wings have certaill disadvantages. Specifically, they are heavier than required by lift and engine loads imposed upon them. Further, they are less efficient than desired. More specifically, the air loading of a typical jet transport wing decreases along the span of the wing from approximately 75 semispan outwardly to the tip. Air loading decreases because the span wise load is tailored to minimize induced drag and because of tip effects.Even though air loading decreases near the outer end of a wing, a constant t c ratio wing is thicker than necessary in this region. That is, the outer portion of such a wing has greater structural bending strength in the span wise direction than needed to support the decreasing air loads. Since the outboard region is thicker than necessary, the aerodynamic drag and weight of a constant t c ratio wing is also greater than necessary. One approach to reducing the aerodynamic drag and weight of a wing is to decrease or taper the tic ratio of the wing continously front wing root to tip. Decreasing wills weight by tapering tiie tic ratio of tiie wing without collsideration of three dill erlsinntll aerodynamic design would be unaceptab e because such a wing would have a premature drag rise due to tlle unsweeping of transonic isobars, and more importantly, the shock, on the wing surface.Transonic isobar unsweeping would occur because an increasing amount of wing lift is carried on the lower surface of the wing as wing thickness is reduced. The present invention is directed to a tapered t c ratio wing that avoids this disadvantage. That is, the present invention is directed to a tapered t c ratio wing having a transonic isobar pattern similar to that occurring on the surface of a constant outboard t c ratio wing. Summary of the Invention In accordance with the present invention, a continously tapered thickness chord length tIc ratio wing hereinafter referred to as a tapered ratio wing is provided. The tapered ratio wing weighs less and has less drag than a constant t c ratio wing hereinafter referred to as a constant ratio wing having equivalent speed and lift capabilities. Further, the tapered ratio wing is formed such that isobars produced at transonic speeds will not unsweep. In accordance with the invention, tiie tapered ratio wing has airfoil stiapcs whose t c ratio continuously decreases across the wing span going from the root to The tip.Further, the camber of the tapered ratio wing is tailored in a manner that prevents the unsweeping of span wise oriented isobars that are produced when the wing moves through the air at transonic speeds. Preferably, aerodynamically tailoring the tapered ratio wing to prevent the unsweeping of span wise oriented isobars includes increasing the incremental camber separation of tulle tapered ratio wing in the outward spanwise direction relative to a constant ratio wing having the same sweep und plallforrll. The incremental camber separation is defined as the displacement of the caniber line of a tapered ratio wing relative to the camber line of a constant ratio wing at the same spanwise location. Preferably, the incremental camber separation increases from less than .001 so chord length at approximately 60 semispan to greater than .0085c at the tip of the wing. Tailoring the wing shape in this manner results in a tapered ratio wing that has more maximum lift coefficient capability and more buffet margin than a constant ratio wing having comparable speed and lift capabilities. Also, preferably, the midspan region of a tapered ratio wing formed in accordance with this invention is configured to be thicker than tile corresponding region of a constant ratio wing, permitting the outer skin of the wing to be thinned while maintaining adequate bending strength. Additiolially, a thicker midspan region provides the tapered ratio wiilg with greater torsional rigidity and less weight in the area where wing mounted engines are normally located. Brief Description of the Drawings Other aspects and advantages of the present invention will becorne apparent to one skilled in the art after a reading of the following description of a preferred embodiment of the hlvention taken togetller with the accompanying drawing in which FIGURE 1 is a plan view of a swept wing having a single wingmounted engine FIGURE 2 is a side elevation, cross sectional view of the wing taken along section line 2 2 of FIGURE 1 FIGURE 3 is a graph showing the relationship between the thickness chord length t c ratio and spanwise location for a constant ratio wing and a tapered ratio wing FIGURE 4 is a graph showing the desired relationship between sectional lift coefficient and spanwise locations for a wing FIGURE 5a is a schematic plan view of a swept wing slaowi g a desirable transonic isobar pattern FIGURE 5b is a schematic plan view of a swept wing slowing the unsweeping of transonic isobars FIGURE 6 is a sciematic side elevational view of sections of a tapered ratio wing and a constant ratio wing taken at the same spanwise location showing the difference in camber between the two wings and, FIGURE 7 is a graph showing the relationship between increnental camber separation and chordwise and spanwise location. Detailed Description FIGURE 1 depicts a plan view of a tapered thickness chord length t c ratio swept wing 10 hereinafter a tapered ratio wing attached to the fuselage 12 of an aircraft. Spanwise, tapered ratio wing 10 starts at a root 14 located adjacent the fuselage 12 and terminates at a tip 16. SpalIwise positions on tapered ratio wing 10 are referred to herein in terms of their percent locations aloiig the span of the wing, with tiie root being 0 and the tip being 100 . For descriptive purposes, the tapered ratio wing 10 is divided into inboard and outboard regions 20 and 24, respectively. The inboard region 20 extends from the wing root 14 to approximately 35 semispan, and tile outboard region 24 extends from approximately 359Ó semispan to the wing tip 16. In the embodiment shown, a wing mounted engine 25 is located at approximntely 35 semispan, Preferably, the planform of the tapered ratio wing 10 is the same as that of a conventional swept wing having a constant t c ratio hereinafter a constant ratio wing .As a result, the considerations involved in choosing a wing planform, such as overall aerodynamic efficiency, span wise distribution of sectional lift coefficients, airspeed requirements, wing weight, and internal volume, are not affected by incorporatioli of the present invention. Since standard techniques are employed to establish the planform shape for the tapered ratio wing 10, they will not be discussed herein. While the cross sectional configuration e.g., span wise sections of the tapered ratio wing 10 vary considerably in thickness from the root 14 to the tip 16, the location and configuration of the wing structural components of each section is substantially identical. A typical spanwise section 26 is illustrated inFIGURE 2 and discussed next. The spanwise section 26 illustrated in FIGURE 2 includes an outer skin 30, which defines an upper surface 32 and a lower surface 34 that extend from a leading edge 36 to a trailing edge 38. In FIGURE 2, a camber line 42 is shown extending between the leading edge 36 and the trailing edge 38. The camber line 42 is a reference line that lies one half the distance between the upper and lower surfaces 32 and 34. The camber line 42 is to be distinguished from the wing chord, which is the shortest distance between the leading and trailing edges 36 and 38. Located between the upper and lower surfaces 32 and 34 are two spars a front spar 44 and rear spar 46. The front and rear spars 44 and 46 are oriented substantially vertically and extend spanwise from the root 14 to wing tip 16 FIGURE 1 . The maximum distance between upper and lower surfaces 32 and 34 of any spanwise section 26 is the wing thickness of that section. The front and rear spars 44 and 46 and the portions of upper and lower surfaces 32 and 34 between the spars form a wing box 48 that is the main structural load bearing component of the tapered ratio wing 10.As will be readily appreciated by those skilled in this art from the foregoing description of FIGURE 2, the tapered ratio wing 10 has an arrangement of component parts that is substantially identical to that of a conventiollal constant ratio wing. Since various aspects of the present invention will be best understood when explained in comparison with a conventioltAl, constant ratio wing, the following discussion is based on such a comparision. In this regard,FIGURE 3 is a graph plotting the t c ratios of a constant ratio wing and a tapered ratio Willg 10 ngninst semispan location.More specifically, lss ed line A denotes the t c ratio for a constant ratio W ing, i.e., A wing ii iving a substantially constant t c ratio from approximately 30 semispan outward to the wing tip, and solid line B denotes the t c ratio for tapered ratio wing 10 formed in accordance with the invention. The constant and tapered ratio wings upon which the graph of FIGURE 3 is based are designed to have approximately the same lift and speed capability. As can be seen from FIGURE 3, the t c ratios of a tapered ratio wing 10 are the same as the t e ratios of a constant ratio wing at only two spanwise locations the root and 80 semispan. The mach number capability of a typical medium aspect ratio transport wing, i.e., a wing having an aspect ratio of 6 to 10, is usually limited by the portion of the wing lying in the 60 to 80 semispan region, where the sectional lift coefficient, C1, is highest FIGURE 4 . It is in this same semispan region that the t e ratio curve of a tapered ratio wing 10 will cross the t c ratio curve of a constant ratio wing designed for the same speed and lift capability.That is, while FIGURE 3 illustrates t c ratio curves crossing at 80 semispan, this crossing point is to be taken as exemplary, not limiting. Curves comparing other tapered ratio wings formed in accordance with the invention with constant ratio wings having equivalent speed and lift capabilities will cross at other locations lying in the 60 to 80 semispan region. Curve B of FIGURE 3 represents the t c ratio distribution of an actual embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment, both the thickness t and the chord length c of each spanwise section 26 FIGURE 2 decreased linearly from approximately 35 semispan to the tip 16. While both thickness and chord length decreased in a linear manner, the rate of change of each parameter is different, resulting in curve B being defined by a quudratic equation. While nonlinear thickness and or chord length changes fall within the scope of the invention, choosing a linearly varying thickness distribution has the manufacturing advantage of allowing linearly changing front and rear spars 44 and 46 to be used, as opposed to nonlinearly changing spars, which are more expensive to produce. As noted above, preferably, the planform of the tapered ratio wing 10 is the same as a constant ratio wing having similar speed and lift capabilities.As a result, the spanwise lift distribution curve for the tapered ratio wiring 10 is the same as that for a constant ratio wing. FIGURE 4 is an example of a span wise distribution curve for a constant ratio, and, thus, a tapered ratio wing formed in accordance with the invention. More specifically, FIGURE 4 is a graph showing the distribution of sectional lift coefficient C1 for tapered ratio wing 10 with respect to percent semispan location.The relationship between sectional lift eoeffieient and sectional lifl is given by ttie equation Sectional Lift C1 q S where C1 sectional lift coefficient q 1 2 p vê p air density and v freestream air velocity and, S representative area. As will be observed from viewixlg FIGURE 4, the span loading decreases from 80 semispan outwardly hereinafter referred to as tip region 50 . It is this decrease that allows the thickness of the tip region 50 of a tapered ratio wing 10 formed in accordance with the invention to be substantially decreased. And, of course, it is the variation in thickness that reduces overall wing weight and decreases aerodynamic drag. That is, as known to those skilled in this art, the cross sectional configuration of the tip region of a constant ratio wing is thicker than required by the bending force created by lift loads. The added thickness arises not from structural requirements, but from The use of a constant t c ratio design approach.The end result is a wing with greater aerodynamic drag and weight than desired. While the weight of the tip region could theoretically be decreased by using thinner skin material, this approach is limited by skin materials minimum gage requirements created by fastener insertion, puncture resistance, and the need to withstand lightning strikes. The tapered ratio wing 10 overcomes these disadvantages by reducing the thickness of the tip region 50 of the wing as compared to The thickness of tlle tip region of a constant ratio wing.The thickness is decreased to the point where tile spanwise bending strength of the tip region 50 corresponds more closely to that required to withstand the bending moments imposed by the lift forces. Two advantages result from the thinner tip region 50 of a tapered ratio wing 10 formed in accordance with the invention. The first advantage is the reduction in weight that is achieved by reducing the height of wing box 48.The second advantage is the reduction in aerodynamic drag due to reduced thickness super velocities. While the tip region 50 of a tapered ratio wing 10 formed in accordance witll the invention is thinner than the tip region of a constant ratio wing, the remainder of outboard region 24, i.e., ttie 35 to 80 semispan region hereinafter referred to as midspan region 52 is, preferably, chooscri to be thicker tllan the eorresponding region of an equivalent capability constant ratio wing. Choosing a thickness greater than that of a constant ratio wing has both weight aiid torsional rigidity benefits, wilicll are discussed next. The required bending strength of the tnidspan region of a constant ratio wing is normally achieved by increasing skin thickness above the riiiriiriurn gage required by fastener installation, puncture resistance, etc., rather than increasing the span wise bending strength of the structural components that support the skin. Because a tapered ratio wing avoids the tight thickness limitations of a constant ratio wing, wing thickness, and thus, span wise strength, can be increased without requiring that skin thickness be increased over the minimum gage required by other factors.Moreover, structural component spanwise bending strength does not need to be increased since such strength is automatically increased by the thicker wing. In other words, increasing the thickness of the midspan region 52 automatically increases tulle spanwise bending strength of spars 44 and 46 because the height of the spars, and thus, their section modulus, is increased. The greater structural spanwise bending strength in midspan region 52 allows the thickness of the outer skin 30 to be decreased without any overall loss in span wise bending strength. As a result, the overall weight of the midspan region 52 of a tapered ratio wing 10 relative to a constant ratio wing is decreased. A further advantage of increasing the thickness of the midspan region 52 is an increase in the torsional rigidity of the wing in the region where a wing mounted engine 25 is normally located, thus providillg a stronger niounting structure for the engine. While the drag of the midspan region 52 of a tapered ratio wing 10 formed in accordance with the invention is increased by a small amount when compared to a constant ratio wing with the same capabilities due to the increase in wing thickness, the increase in overall aircraft efficiency gained by the decreased weight of a tapered ratio wing 10 is greater tltan the decrease in efficiency resulting from the increased drag. The thickness of tie inboard region 20 of a tapered ratio wing 10 formed in accordance with this invention is, preferably, chosen to be tfie same as the corresponding thickness of this region of a constant ratio wing. As known to those skilled in the art, the sections in the inboard region of a conventional, constant ratio wing require extensive three dimensional aerodynamic design. The inboard sections of a tapered ratio wing 10 formed in accordance with the invention requires similar design tailoring. The required tailoring techniques are well known to those skilled in the art and they will not be discussed herein. Since no portion of a tapered ratio wing 10 formed in accordance with this invention behaves like a two dimensional airfoil, the entire outboard region 24 must also be tailored. Without tailoring, the transonic isobars and shock developed on tie wing will unsweep in tic outboard region 24 see FIGURE sub , resulting in hlerensed drag. In t lis regard, a preferret3 transonic isobar pattern ior the upper surface 32 of a swept wing is depicted inFIGURE 5a. As illustrated, tlie isobars 54 on the outboard region 24 of the wing lie substantially parallel to the sweep of the wing.In order to achieve a desirable isobar pattern FIGURE 5a and not a pattern that results in the unsweeping of isobars FIGURE 5b , a tapered ratio wing 10 formed in accordance with the invention is tailored by over cambering the wing relative to the camber of a constant ratio wing. The concept of over cambering is illustrated in FIGURE 6, wherein equal chord length sections of a tapered ratio wing 10 and a constant ratio wing having comparable lift and speed capabilites are compared. In this Figure, a section 56 of a constant ratio wing having a camber line 58 is depicted by solid lines and a section 60 of a tapered ratio wing formed in accordance with the invention having a camber line 62 is depicted by dashed lines. As clearly shown in FIGURE 6, the camber line 62 of the tapered ratio wing section 60 lies above the camber line 58 of the constant ratio wiiig section 56.The separation between the two camber lines defines an incremental camber separation A z, which starts at zero at tlle leading edge of the wilig, increases to u maximum value at some point located forward of the 50 chord line, and then decreases to zero at the trailing edge of the wing. Further, the incremental camber separation ss z of the preferred embodiment of a tapered ratio wing 10 formed in accordance with this invention increases in the spanwise direction frorn approximately 60 semispan to the tip 16. As shown in FIGURE 7, in one actual embodiment of the invention, the maximum incremental camber separation at 63 semispan was reaelled at approximately the 39 chord position and had a value of approximately .0015 chord length at the seinispan position the maximum incremental camber separation at 79 scmispan was reached at approximately the 43 chord position and had a value of approximately .0042 to the chord length at this semispan position the maximum incremental camber separation at 88 semispan was reached at approximately the 41 chord position and had a value of approximately .0055 of the chord length at this semispan position the maxillluln inerernental camber distance at 95 selnispan was reached at approximately the 4196 chord position and had a value of approximately .007 of the chord length at this seinispan position and, the maximum incremental camber distance at 100 semispan was reached at approximately the 419 chord position and llad a value of approximately .0082 of the chord length at tlsis sernispan position. The determination of the additional camber necessary to blend the continuously tapering sections of tapered ratio wing 10 togetller into an acceptable three dimensional wing design can be accomplished by a varidy of techniques well known to practicing aerodynamicists. One approach to the problem uses a transonic wing analysis design finite difference solution, such as the well accepted computer program of Anthony Jameson of the CourantInstitute of Mathematics at New York University, to design very accurately the upper surface for the desired upper surface isobar pattern.Another approucll uses a linearized camber thickness lifting surface theory computer program in which the wing is represented by planar distributions of discrete vortex and source panels that mathematically represent the camber and thickness of the wing, respectively. A finite element solution for the vortex and source panel strengths is formulated to yield the desired upper and lower surface distributions. For a tapered ratio wing 10 formed in accordance with the present invention, after the thickness envelopes of the wing are specified by fixing the surface source distribution, the camber distribution can be determined from the desired upper surface distribution developed in the manner just described. There are a number of computer programs available to solve this type of problem, or one can be formulated from text book information.Use of a large digital computer is required. Finally, a reasonably close camber design can be accomplished rather quickly by trial and error design and analysis cycles using any standard potential flow wing analysis program, many of which are in the public domain and readily available from tise National Aeronautical and SpaceAdministration, universities, etc. In addition to the weight improvement discussed above, due to the aerodynamic tailoring required to make the tapered ratio wing 10 formed in accordance with the invention work at transonic speeds, it has been found that such a wing has more maximum lift coefficient capability and more buffet margin than a comparable constant ratio wing. These improvements in the performance of the tapered ratio wing 10 formed in accordance with the invention appear to be a direct consequence of the increased incremental camber separation on outboard region 24 of the wing included to achieve the desired transonic isobar pattern. While a preferred embodiment of the invention has been illustrated and described, it will be appreciated that various changes can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, as noted above, while a tapered ratio wing formed in accordance with the invention having a linear chord length decrease and a linear thickness decrease at different rates has manufneturing advantages, the decreasing rate of eEIangc of eitller or both of thcse parameters may be nolllinear if desired. Additioi illy, as will be recognized by those skilled in the art, a tapered ratio wing formed in accordance with this invention may include discontinuities in The decreasing tic ratio, i.e., a constant or increasing t e ratio, for the installation of lights, mechanical systems, or other auxiIiary equipment. A tapered ratio wing formed with such discontinuities in the t e ratio does not depart frorn the spirit aid scope of the invention. Further, the tailoring of the outboard portion of the wing discussed above and depicted in FIGURE 7 are considered exemplary, not limiting. It is therefore intended tllat the scope of Letters Patent granted hereon be limited only by the definitions contained in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
