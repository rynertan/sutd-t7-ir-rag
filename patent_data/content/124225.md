# Cable shield grounding clamp.

## Abstract
A clamp 10 is disclosed for securing shielding 20, 22 of a shielded flat multiconductor cable 10 to the periphery of an aperture 26 in a panel 14 , through which the cable 12 passes, thereby providing an RF EMI shielded entry through the panel 14 . The clamp 10 includes a central aperture 26 through which the cable 12 passes and a pair of lateral flanges 34, 36 which, when folded upon themselves, secure portions of the cable shielding 20, 22 and cable insulation 24 thereby providing both a ground path and strain relief for the cable 12 . The clamp 10 can be mounted on either surface of a panel 14 land entirely encloses the aperture 26 therein.
