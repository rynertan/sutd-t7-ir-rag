## Description
The present invention relates to a catalytic conversion process for xylenes containing ethylbenzene. Among the xylenes, it is para xylene that is in the greatest industrial demand at present, so the isomerization technique for converting ortho and meta xylenes which are in less demand into para xylene is industrially important. In general, industrially utilized xylenes are obtained by aromatic extraction and fractional distillation of reaction products from reforming or cracking of naphthas. But all of the crude xylenes thus obtained contain ethylbenzene in addition to ortho , meta and para xylenes. Therefore, ethylbenzene is removed from such crude xylenes by some suitable means, and para xylene is produced by the combination of separation and isomerisation steps. Ethylbenzene may be removed by direct separation thereof or by reaction thereof for conversion into a more useful compound. An example of the former is the distillation process wherein, however, it is necessary to perform an ultra rectification because of a small difference in boiling point between ethylbenzene and xylenes, and this necessity results in increased equipment cost and running expenses. Thus, the distillation process is disadvantageous from the economic point of view. An example of the latter is a method wherein ethylbenzene is converted to xylenes by using a bifunctional catalyst comprising a platinum component and a solid acid component and at the same time there is performed isomerisation of the xylenes. The method of removing ethylbenzene by this reaction is economically advantageous because it requires no special equipment. But a further improvement is desired because of problems involved therein, for example, platinum used in the above mentioned bifunctional catalyst is a very expensive noble catalyst, and the conversion of ethylbenzene is restricted by a thermodynamic equilibrium relation between ethylbenzene and xylene isomers. As the method for overcoming the above mentioned problems, an increasing attention has recently been placed on a conversion process for ethylbenzene into benzene and ethane by using a catalyst comprising a solid acid component and a hydrogenation component. The hydrodealkylation reaction of ethylbenzene into benzene and ethane has features such that the improvement of conversion is relatively easy because the reaction scarcely undergoes thermodynamic restrictions, and that the resulting benzene is easily separable by distillation, because of a large difference in boiling point from xylenes, and has a high added value as a raw material for synthetic fibers and synthetic resins. As a catalyst for allowing such reaction to proceed efficiently, the present inventors have proposed a mordenite catalyst containing rhenium and or phosphorus or this mordenite catalyst further containing molybdenum, tungsten and or vanadium, previously in Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication Nos. 9727 1982, 64623 1982 and 134423 1982. But, to make this reaction more efficient, it is desirable to further improve the catalyst activity and selectivity. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a process for de ethylation of ethylbenzene into benzene and simultaneous isomerisation of ortho and meta xylenes into paraxylene in feedstocks containing xylenes and ethylbenzene with a catalyst in the presence of hydrogen, characterised in that a catalyst is used which comprises an acid type mordenite together with an acid type zeolite which exhibits the X ray diffraction pattern described in Table 1 below, said zeolite being present in the range of 1 to 50 by weight based on the total weight of said zeolite and said mordenite. As the mordenite used in the present invention, there may be employed any synthetic or natural zeolite having the crystal structure of mordenite. Of course, a mixture of synthetic and natural zeolites may be used. The mordenite can be produced, for example, by the process disclosed in U.S. Patent No.3,436,174 or European Laid Open Patent Publication No.57,016. As the zeolite used in the present invention, exhibiting the X ray diffraction pattern shown in Table 1, there may be employed, for example, ZSM 5 disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,894,106, ZSM 8 disclosed in British Patent No. 1,334,243, ZSM 11 disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 9,709,979, Zeta 3 disclosed in German Laid Open Patent Publication No. 2,548,695, zeolite prepared without adding an organic substance into reaction mixture, as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,257,885, or zeolite prepared by adding a carboxyl group containing organic compound into reaction mixture, as disclosed in European Laid Open Patent Publication No. 57,016. Without being restricted to those just exemplified above, any other zeolites are employable provided they have a structural characteristic exhibiting the X ray diffraction pattern shown in Table 1. But, zeolites which exhibit the X ray diffraction pattern shown in Table 2 below are more preferable. The SiO₂ Al₂O₃ mole ratio of the zeolite is preferably not less than 10, particularly in the range of 20 to 200 and further 30 to 150. The weight ratio between the zeolite hereinafter referred to as the zeolite a which exhibits the X ray diffraction pattern shown in Table 1, and the mordenite, both contained in the catalyst used in the present invention, is in the range of 1 to 50 , preferably 5 to 30 , in terms of percentage by weight of the zeolite a based on the total weight of zeolite a and mordenite. The catalyst may contain an additional component or components, for example, an inert alumina, other than the two kinds of zeolites described above. The mordenite and the zeolite a , before their use in the invention, should be treated into acid type. Acid type zeolites, as well known, have hydrogen ions as cations, and they are obtained usually by ion exchanging at least some of the alkali metal ions and or alkaline earth metal ions of zeolites which contain those exchangeable cations, with hydrogen ions and or ammonium cations as hydrogen ion precursors. Generally, the ion exchange treatment is carried out by using an aqueous solution which contains and acid and or an ammonium salt. In this case, both inorganic and organic acids are employable, but the use of inorganic acids is more common. Examples of inorganic acids include hydrochloric, nitric, phosphoric and carbonic acids. Of course, there may be used other inorganic acids provided they contain hydrogen ion. Preferred concentrations of acids vary according to the kind of acids used, so it is difficult to define such concentrations absolutely, but care should be exercised to avoid destruction of the mordenite structure. Examples of ammonium salts which may be used include inorganic ammonium salts such as ammonium nitrate, ammonium chloride, ammonium sulfate, ammonium carbonate and aqueous ammonia, as well as ammonium salts of organic acids such as ammonium formate, ammonium acetate and ammonium citrate, with inorganic ammonium salts being preferred. Ammonium salts are used as a solution of preferably 0.05 to 4 N, more preferably about 0.1 to 2 N. As the method of such ion exchange treatment for the zeolites using the acid and or ammonium salt solution, both batch method and flow method are employable preferably. Where the treatment is made by the batch method, the solid liquid ratio should be at least a ratio at which the zeolites can fully contact the liquid, preferably about 1 l kg or more. A treatment time from about 0.1 to 72 hours is sufficient, preferably from about 0.5 to 24 hours, and a treatment temperature below the boiling point is sufficient, but preferably heat is applied to accelerate the ion exchange rate. Where the flow method is to be followed, there may be adopted the fixed bed process and the fluidized bed process, but it is necessary to take steps to avoid fluid channelling or to avoid the ion exchange treatment becoming non uniform. The zeolites after subjected to the ion exchange treatment are washed with water, preferably with distilled water, according to either the batch method or the flow method. In this way, hydrogen ions or ammonium ions as hydrogen ion precursors are introduced in the zeolites. In the cases of the zeolites ZSM 5, ZSM 8 and ZSM 11, since an organic nitrogen containing cation is used at the time of their production, they can be changed into acid type zeolites by allowing the said organic nitrogen containing cation to decompose upon calcining for conversion thereof into hydrogen ion, even without application of the ion exchange treatment using the acid and or ammonium salt solution. The hydrogen ion content of the catalyst is preferably in the range of 30 to 90 , more preferably 40 to 80 , in terms of gram ion equivalent based on the total exchangeable cations of the zeolite a and the moredenite. A too low hydrogen ion content is not desirable because it would cause deterioration of the reaction activity. A too high hydrogen ion content is not desirable, either, because a disproportionation reaction as a side reaction would be accelerated although the reaction activity would become higher. The zeolites thus ion exchanged with hydrogen ions, namely, the proton type zeolites, if further subjected to heat treatment at a high temperature, become so called decationized zeolites. But, decationized zeolites and proton type zeolites are not always distinguishable clearly from each other and are often used indiscriminately. The acid type as referred to herein includes decationized type. If only the zeolites in the catalyst used in the present invention are acid type zeolites, the remaining cations may be various cations. Particularly, alkaline earth metals are preferred because they are effective in improving the reaction selectivity. To let the zeolites contain alkaline earth metal ions, it is necessary to perform an ion exchange for introducing such ions in addition to the ion exchange for introducing hydrogen ions and or ammonium ions as hydrogen ion precursors. The ion exchange for introducing alkaline earth metal ions is carried out by treating the zeolites with a solution which contains a compound of an alkaline earth metal. Preferred alkaline earth metals are magnesium, calcium, strontium and barium. Where it is necessary to perform the ion exchange for introducing alkaline earth metal ions, this ion exchange treatment may be conducted separately from the ion exchange treatment for introducing ammonium ions, or both treatments may be carried out at the same time. According to a particularly preferred ion exchanging method in the preparation of the catalyst used in the invention, first the ion exchange treatment for introducing alkaline earth metal ions is conducted and then the same treatment for introducing hydrogen ions and or ammonium ions as hydrogen ion precursors is performed by a liquid recycle type batch process. In the reaction of the invention using the catalyst thus prepared, ethylbenzene is hydrodealkylated for conversion to benzene and ethane. Therefore, it is preferable that the catalyst used in the invention contain a component having a certain specific hydrogenation activity. Examples of such component include nickel, cobalt, rhenium, molybdenum, tungsten and vanadium. Noble metals such as platinum and palladium are not preferable in the reaction of the invention. If a platinum supported catalyst is used in the reaction of the invention, there occurs a hydrogenation reaction at the benzene nuclei of the xylenes because the hydrogenation activity of platinum is too strong, and therefore such catalyst is not desirable. A preferred amount of rhenium to be added ranges from 0.005 to 3 , more preferably 0.02 to 0.5 , by weight as the rhenium element based on the weight of the entire catalyst. A preferred amount of molybdenum, tungsten or vanadium to be added ranges from 0.1 to 10 , more preferably 0.2 to 5 , by weight as the element based on the weight of the entire catalyst. A too small amount is not effective, while a too large amount causes side reaction, and thus both such amounts are not desirable. As the method for adding such metal to the other catalyst components, there may be adopted, for example, a kneading method, impregnation method and a method of physically mixing powders with each other. For adding the metal element by the kneading method, a compound of the element may be added and kneaded simultaneously with mixing of the mordenite and the zeolite a in their granulation. According to the impregnation method, usually, it is possible to support the element by impregnating the zeolites after granulation into a solution containing a compound of the element, followed by draining and drying. In the process of the present invention, the impregnation method is preferred. As the solvent for dissolving the compound of the element, there may be used organic solvents such as alcohols, not to mention water. The amount of the element to be added can be adjusted by suitably selecting the concentration of the compound of the element in the solution. Examples of compounds of the element which may be used in the invention include, with respect to rhenium, rhenium oxide, perrhenic acid, ammonium perrhenate and rhenium sulfide with respect to molybdenum, ammonium molybdate, ammonium paramolybdate, ammonium phosphomolybdate, molybdic acid, molybdenum oxide, molybdenum sulfide and molybdates and with respect to tungsten, ammonium tungstate, ammonium phosphotungstate, tungsten oxide, tungsten sulfide, tungsten carbide and tungstates. Either a fixed bed or a fluidized bed may be used as a reaction apparatus in the present invention, but the former is preferred because of simpler construction and easier operation. In the fixed bed process, it is preferable from the standpoint of catalyst effectiveness factor that the particle diameter of the catalyst be as small as possible, provided a too small particle diameter is not desirable because it would cause an increased pressure drop. That is, there exists a preferable range of catalyst diameter, which is from 0.05 to 10 mm, more preferably from 0.1 to 2 mm. As the case may be, molding is needed in order for the catalyst to have such a preferred range of particle diameter, for example, compression molding and extrusion. And in order to improve the moldability or impart strength to the catalyst, there may be used a binder, though it goes without saying that the use of binder may be omitted if molding is attainable to a satisfactory extent without the binder. Preferred examples of the binder include natural clays such as kaolin, bentonite, montmorillonite and acid clay as well as synthetic products such as silica sol, alumina sol and alumina gel. The amount of the binder to be added is not more than 70 , preferably not more than 20 , by weight. The catalyst used in the present invention is prepared basically through the steps of mixing the two zeolite components, molding and treatment into the acid type, the order of which steps may be selected suitably. For example, both zeolite powders may each be treated into the acid type, then mixed and thereafter molded to obtain the catalyst, or both zeolite powders may be molded and treated into the acid type each independently and then mixed to obtain the catalyst. As described above, the catalyst thus prepared is dried and subsequently calcined before its use. The drying is performed at 50 to 250 C for over 0.1 hour, preferably 0.5 to 48 hours, and the calcination is performed at 300 to 700 C for over 0.1 hour, preferably at 400 to 600 C for 0.5 to 24 hours. By this calcination the ammonium ions introduced in the zeolites by the ion exchange treatment are converted to hydrogen ions, which in turn are converted to the decationized type as the calcination temperature increases, and the catalyst in such a form is also employable effectively. The catalyst prepared in the manner described above is used under the following reaction conditions. The operating temperature ranges from 300 to 600 C, preferably from 350 to 550 C, and the operating pressure ranges from atmospheric pressure to 100 bar gauge 100 kg cm² G preferably from atmospheric pressure to 50 bar gauge 50 kg cm² G . The time factor W F g cat hr g mol feedstock, W catalyst weight, F mol feed stock per hour which means the contact time of reaction is in the range of 0.1 to 200, preferably 1 to 100. It is essential that hydrogen is present in the reaction system. If the hydrogen concentration is too low, the dealkylation reaction of ethylbenzene will not proceed to a sufficient extent and a carbonaceous component will be deposited on the catalyst thus resulting in deterioration of the catalyst activity with the lapse of time. A too high concentration of hydrogen is not desirable, either, because, it would cause an increase of hydrocracking reaction. That is, there exists a preferable range of hydrogen concentration, which is 1 to 50, preferably 3 to 30, in terms of mol ratio of hydrogen to feed stock H₂ F . As the feed stock there is used a mixture of xylenes containing ethylbenzene, wherein the concentration of ethylbenzene is not specially limited. The concentration of para xylene in the xylene mixture is preferably below the thermodynamic equilibrium concentration, but it is of course possible, as one mode of use in the present invention, to use as the feed stock a xylene mixture containing para xylene of the thermodynamic equilibrium concentration with a view to decreasing the concentration of ethylbenzene. The feed stock may contain other aromatic components, e.g. benzene, toluene, trimethylbenzene, ethyltoluene, diethylbenzene, ethylxylene, provided their concentrations should be in a low range. The following examples are given to further illustrate the present invention. 14.7 g of a solid sodium hydroxide and 10.5 g of tartaric acid were dissolved in 351 g of water, than 5.24 g of a sodium aluminate solution was added to prepare a homogeneous solution.
