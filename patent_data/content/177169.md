# Thermostatic fluid control valve.

## Abstract
A valve seat structure for an automotive thermostatic fluid control valve device is disclosed, which comprises a rigid fluid flow control member 20 which includes a cylindrical wall 24 which forms a fluid flow passage and an annular base 28 which encompasses the cylindrical wall. An elastomeric sealing or engagement member 30 resi liently encompasses the cylindrical wall and is clamped between two portions 90, 92 of a fluid conduit to position the valve seat structure within the fluid conduit. The elastomeric sealing member 30 is also engageable by a movable valve member 80 to control fluid flow through the fluid flow passage. The cylindrical wall 24 extends beyond the elastomeric sealing member 30 and protects the elastomeric sealing member 30 against the forces of fluid flow.
