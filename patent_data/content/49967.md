# Ammonia production process.

## Abstract
In an ammonia production process a hydrocarbon steam mixture 16 is preheated 18, 24 and reacted in an adiabatic catalyst bed 22, 26 , the resulting methane containing gas is reacted 30 with air 32 to introduce more than 1 N₂ per 3H₂ and purified 44, 48, 54 the purified gas is passed to ammonia synthesis 66 in admixture with a hydrogen rich stream 82 separated at 80 from reacted synthesis gas, and the rate of flow of that stream is controlled so that the H₂ N₂ ratio of the gas entering the synthesis catalyst is in the range 1.0 to 2.5. Preferably methane is purged at 86 to the extent of 5 15 of the hydrocarbon feedstock.
