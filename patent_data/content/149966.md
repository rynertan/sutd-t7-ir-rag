# Catalyst for treating waste gases.

## Abstract
A catalyst for treating waste gases comprising nitrogen oxides, which catalyst comprises a protonized zeolite coating formed on the surface of a catalytic ingredient. This type of catalyst has a prolonged life and is very useful in treating waste gases comprising nitrogen oxides by adding ammonia to the waste gas and reducing the nitrogen oxides in the waste gas with the catalyst to render the nitrogen oxides non noxious.
