# PROCESS FOR EXTRUDING THERMOTROPIC LIQUID CRYSTALLINE POLYMERS

## Abstract
Provided is a process for the extrusion of shaped articles which comprises extruding a thermotropic liquid crystal polymer through a short land or preferably no land die, and with subsequent drawdown of the extruded profile being such as to render a drawdown ration of less than 4, and preferably about 1. Such extrusion of liquid crystal polymers in accordance with the present invention can consistently and reproducibly provide one with an article of high mechanical properties and thus particular advantage is found in employ ing the process to extrude an article of cross sectional dimen sions which must closely approximate those of the extrusion die without sacrificing high mechanical properties.
