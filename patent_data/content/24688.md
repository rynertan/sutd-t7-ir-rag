# Vinyl acetate copolymer emulsions for paint having wet adhesion properties.

## Abstract
This invention relates to latex compositions for use as a paint vehicle particularly for the manufacture of interior semi gloss and flat exterior paint compositions. The latex composition comprises from about 40 70 by weight of resin particles, the resin particles having at least 25 vinyl acetate polymerized therein, and from about 0.5 10 of a copolymerizable allylic amine having at least one allylic group attached directly to an amino nitrogen and at least one hyd rogen atom attached directly to an amino nitrogen atom. In a preferred instance, the resin particles comprise vinyl acetate, a lower alkyl acrylate or ethylene, optionally vinyl chloride and the allylic amine.
