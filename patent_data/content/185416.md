# Radio receiver transmitter filters.

## Abstract
A radio receiver or transmitter including a tunable filter constituted by an N path filter 14 having a local oscillator 52 , the centre frequency of which filter is displaced from the oscillator 52 frequency through the use of feedback 26 . In the case of a radio receiver the feedback provides image rejection. Preferably an i.f. signal is taken from the low frequency section of the N path filter. In the case of a radio transmitter, an i.f. signal is applied to a low frequency path within the N path filter. The use of feedback avoids the generation of an image frequency transmission.
