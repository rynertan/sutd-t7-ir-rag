# APPARATUS FOR DESTACKING SHEETS OF MATERIAL

## Abstract
An apparatus for unstacking or destacking sheets of ma terial from a stack of such sheets is disclosed. The apparatus includes an arrangement for directing air against the stack of sheets in order to entirely separate at least one uppermost sheet of the stack from the remaining sheets by floating that sheet on a layer of air. A pusher mechanism is provided for moving the separated sheet out of registry with the remaining sheets, and into a roller mechanism which displaces the sepa rated sheet from above the remaining sheets of the stack. The apparatus also includes an indexing mechanism for indexing the stack of sheets upwardly in order to float the next sheet of the stack and present it to the pusher mechanism. A sensing mechanism is provided for determining the position of the uppermost one of the remaining sheets of the stack as the stack is indexed upwardly. Notably, the apparatus can be used for destacking sheets of a wide variety of materials, and is oper able at a relatively high speed with minimal scratching, marring, or other damage to the sheets.
