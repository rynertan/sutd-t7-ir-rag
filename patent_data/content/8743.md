# Method for improving the vibration absorption of a railway track supported on a bed of ballast and a track structure obtained by applying such a method.

## Abstract
Method, track structure and sleeper for improving the vibration absorbtion of a railway track supported on a bed of ballast, more especially a ballast bed lying in a tunnel, on a fly over or another artificial construction, said track consisting of rails 2,3 supported by sleepers 5 extending in lateral direction, wherein the track is lifted some centimeters that around the edge of the supporting surface of the sleepers 5 the ballast lying above the level of said surface is removed, that a plate 8 of a vibration energy absorbing material is shifted between the supporting surface of the ballast bed 1 and the sleepers 5 and that thereafter the track is lowered again and as far as is required the ballast around the sleepers is brought in the original position or there is supplied new ballast.
