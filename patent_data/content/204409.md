## Description
The present invention relates to modular electrical connectors, e.g. connectors commonly referred to as modular phone receptacles or jacks, and to methods of making same. Modular electrical connectors known as modular phone receptacles or jacks have been known in the art for many years. Although connectors of this type were originally designed in the telecommunications industry and, in particular, for telephones, these connectors have found wide acceptance other than for connecting a telephone to a telephone network. Other common uses include an input output I O interface with other communications pheripheral equipment. Modular phone jacks are adapted to receive a conventional modular plug. Thus, the jack has a housing with a plug receiving socket formed therein to receive the plug. The socket is defined by a plug receiving opening, opposed top and bottom surfaces joined by opposed side surfaces extending from said opening to join a back surface. A plurality of stamped, metallic elongated conductors are mounted to the housing in some fashion. Each conductor includes a contact portion at one end extending diagonally into the socket, a lead portion at the other end and an intermediate portion between said contact portion and lead portion. It is advantageous to form the metallic conductors from flat stock. In this manner a plurality of conductors can be stamped at one time. Two examples of modular phone jacks employing flat stamped metallic conductors are disclosed in United States Patent Nos. 4,292,736 and 4,315,664. Both of these patents disclose a one piece dielectric housing having channels formed in the external surfaces thereof. The channels serve to locate and hold the flat stamped conductors therein. U.S. Patent No. 4,292,736 discloses a method of producing a one piece modular phone jack. The method generally comprises Sometimes, to achieve greater modularity, it is preferred to produce a two piece modular phone jack assembly. An example of such an assembly employing flat stamped metallic contacts is disclosed in United States Patent No. 4,327,958. Other examples of two piece designs are disclosed in United States Patent Nos 4,202,593 and 4,274,691. Typically, two piece modular phone jack assemblies include a connector housing having a forward end with the plug receiving opening formed therein, two opposed sidewalls, the internal surfaces thereof defining said socket side surfaces, a top wall joining said sidewalls and a rearward end with a rear opening formed therein. A carrier subassembly is mounted through the rear opening of the housing. The subassembly has a dielectric support member to which the conductors are mounted. Means are provided which cooperate between the housing and subassembly to lock the subassembly to the housing. Such a two piece modulat phone jack is disclosed in Technical Digest, Western Electric, No. 74, July 1984, P. 17 18. Although two piece assemblies offer some advantages regarding mechanical strength and integrity, it has always been assumed that it is more expensive to manufacture and assemble a two piece jack assembly as compared with a one piece jack. This is mainly due to the fact that it has heretofore not been known how to automate such a manufacturing process. The present invention provides, from one aspect, an improved low cost two piece modular phone jack assembly of the type described above which is easier to manufacture and assemble. Said carrier subassembly member comprises The present invention further provides the new and improved method of manufacturing and assembling the modular phone jack assembly described herein comprising producing said support member so that it includes a body portion having a forwardly facing surface defining the back surface of the socket, a base portion having means for receiving and holding the conductor lead portions and a conductor mounting portion joining and extending forwardly of said body portion and having a forward edge and rearward edge and bending the first end portions and second end portions of the conductors simultaneously against the forward and rearward edges to form the contact portions and end portions respectively. One way of carrying out the present invention in both its apparatus and method aspects will now be described by way of example, and not by way of limitation with reference to drawings which show one specific embodiment of a modular phone jack assembly of the present invention and various steps in its manufacture. In the drawings Turning now to the drawings, Fig. 1 shows the phone jack assembly of the present invention, generally designated 10, mounted on a printed circuit board 12. The jack assembly 10 is adapted to receive mate with a standard modular phone plug, generally designated 14. The plug 14 is seen to generally include a housing 16 having a plurality of terminals 18 therein. The terminals 18 are adapted to electrically contact the jack assembly 10 at one end thereof and the conductors not shown of the plug cord 20 at the other end. A manually manipulateable flexible latch 22 is formed on the plug housing 16 to lock and remove the plug 14 from the jack assembly 10. The jack assembly 10 is of typical dimensions in order to comply with FCC regulation 68.5. As such, the jack assembly 10 has a plug receiving socket, generally designated 24, formed and defined by a plug receiving opening 26, opposed top and bottom surfaces, 28 and 30 respectively, which are joined by opposed side surfaces 32 and 34 which extend from said opening 26 to join a back surface 36. The jack assembly 10 generally includes a connector housing, generally designated 38 which mounts a carrier subassembly, generally designated 40 see Fig. 3 . The carrier subassembly 40 includes a dielectric support member, generally designated 42, which mounts a plurality of stamped, metallic, elongated conductors, generally designated 44. Looking at Figs. 1 to 3, the housing 38 includes a forward end with the plug receiving opening 26 formed therein. Surrounding opening 26 are two opposed sidewalls 46 and 48 wherein the internal surfaces thereof define the socket side surfaces 32 and 34, respectively, and a top wall 50 and an opposed bottom wall 52. The front end of the housing 26 has a front mounting face 54 surrounding the plug opening 26. The mounting face 54 has a rearwardly facing surface 55 depending from top wall 50. As best seen in Fig. 3, a three sided rear shrouded portion 56 extends from the top wall 50 and two side walls 46 and 48 to define the rear opening through which the carrier subassembly 40 is received to be mounted to the housing 38. Formed immediately forward of the shrouded portion 56 is comb structure 58 which is adapted to cooperate with the conductors 44 in a manner which will be described in greater detail hereinafter. As is best seen in Figs. 1 and 3, the housing 38 has a pair of vertical locating ribs 60, one formed on each sidewall 46 and 48. The ribs 60 are adapted to engage a surface of a panel not shown immediately adjacent an opening through which the jack assembly 10 is received to provide a flush mount with the face of 54 of housing 38. Looking at Fig. 3, guide channels 62 are formed on the interior of the shrouded portion 56 of sidewalls 46 and 48. The guide channels 62 extend forwardly to an opening 64 on each sidewall 46 and 48 which serves to interengage with a portion of the carrier subassembly 40 in a manner which will be described in greater detail hereinafter. Housing 38 has a slot 66 formed in bottom wall 52 as is seen in Fig. 3. As with opening 64, slot 66 is adapted to interengage with a portion of the carrier subassembly 40 in a manner which will he discussed in greater detail hereinafter. A pair of depending mounting pegs 68 are formed on the bottom wall 52 of housing 38. Pegs 68 are adapted to be received in suitable apertures not shown formed in the printed circuit board 12 in a well known manner to secure the jack assembly 10 thereto. Turning now to the carrier subassembly 40 and, in particular, the support member 42 in greater detail, the support member 42 is seen to generally comprise a vertical portion 72 housing a rearwardly extending horizontal base portion 74 and a forwardly extending cantilevered top conductor mounting portion 76. The forwardly facing surface of body portion 72 defines the aforementioned back surface 36. The portion 72 also has a pair of side panel portions 78. The top portion 76 of support member 42 has an upper surface 82 with a plurality of upstanding, staggered locating projections or pins 84. The front end of the top portion 76 has a front edge 86 Fig. 5 with a plurality of conductor locating fins 88 formed thereat. The conductors 44 are mounted on the upper surface 82 of the top portion 76 so that a portion thereof extends from the front edge 86 to a rear edge 90 Fig. 6 . A pair of side locking wings 92 are provided on the top portion 76. Locking wings 92 are receivable within guide channels 62 and interengage into openings 64 when the carrier subassembly 40 is mounted to the housing 38. The base portion 74 has a rearwardly extending staggered contact receiving structure 96 with restricted contact receiving slots 98 formed therein. Each slot 98 has a tapered guide or throat portion 100 formed rearwardly as is best shown in Fig. 5 in order to guide a portion of a conductor 44 therein. Extending laterally of the base portion 74 are a pair of standoff block portions 102. Block portions 102 underlie the shrouded portion 56 and comprise an extension of sidewalls 46 and 48 when the carrier subassembly 40 is mounted within the housing 38. To further secure the carrier subassembly 40 into the housing 38, a pair of resilient tabs 104 extend forwardly of the base portion 74. Tabs 104 are adapted to be received within slot 66 in the housing and have hooked portions that engage shoulders not shown therein when the carrier subassembly 40 is mounted to the housing 38. Looking at Fig. 3, each conductor is seen to generally include a contact portion 110, a lead portion 112 and an intermediate portion 114 therebetween. The intermediate portion 114 of each conductor 44 has a pair of spaced apart pilot holes 116 formed therein. The pilot holes 116 of adjacent conductors 44 are staggered with respect to one another. Locating projections 84 are adapted to be received within pilot holes 116 so as to position the conductor 44 on the support member 42. Each conductor 44 also includes a stop shoulder 118 formed on the lead portion 112 thereof. The stop shoulder 118 engages the bottom of the contact receiving structure 96 so as to prevent accidental removal of the lead portions 112 due to an upwardly directed pushout force. When the carrier subassembly 40 is mounted within the housing 38, and held in that position by virtue of the interengagement of locking wings 92 with openings 64 and tabs 104 within slots 66, contact portions 110 of the conductors 44 are positioned and held apart by the comb structure 58. When fully assembled, the jack assembly 10 meets all the required specifications and has all the necessary dimensions to receive a standard modular phone plug 14. In the past, it was widely accepted that the only reason to have a two piece jack assembly was to achieve modularity. It was assumed that the manufacturing process and, in particular, the assembly procedure would be more complicated, and, therefore, more costly than a one piece design. As with a one piece design, the conductors 44 are provided in a typical flat stamped metallic strip not shown consisting of a plurality of groups 124 of conductors Fig. 4 . Each group 124 of conductors 44 is stamped so that there are a pair of carrier strip 126, one at each end thereof. The first step is to position a group 124 of conductors on the upper surface 82 of the top portion 76 of support member 42. The conductors 44 are accurately positioned by means of the upstanding projections 84 being received in the corresponding locating or pilot holes 116. The next step, as best shown in Fig. 7, requires that the support member 42 and the positioned group 124 of conductors 44 are held or received within a suitable tool nest 128. The group 124 of conductors lie on top of an anvil 130 which faces a cutoff punch 132. When the punch 132 is actuated downwardly, the carrier strips 126 are removed while, simultaneously, the tops of the projections 84 are deformed or staked. After deformation, the cross sectional area of the tops of the projections 84 is larger than the pilot holes 116. In this manner, the intermediate portions 114 of conductors 44 are accurately and permanently positioned and secured to the support member. It is because of this positive positioning that the succeeding steps of the method of production can be produced with a great deal of economy and efficiency. Turning now to Fig. 8, the support member 42 which has the conductors 44 secured thereto, is positioned within a holding fixture 134. A top forming die 136 is downwardly moveable so that the conductors 44 are formed to produce the bends which divide the intermediate portion 114 from the contact portion 110 and lead portion 112. The contact portion 110 is about the front edge 86 of the top portion 76 while the lead portion 112 is formed about the rear edge 90. The downward bending of both the contact portions 110 and lead portions 112 of all of the conductors 44 occurs simultaneously unlike in the prior art. After the contact portions 110 and lead portions 112 are initially formed, a second forming operation is performed as is shown in Fig. 9. The top forming die 136 is raised somewhat to allow for adequate clearance for a front forming die 138 and a rear forming die 140. Both forming dies 138 and 140 are moved simultaneously toward the support member 42 so that the contact portions 110 of the conductors 44 are angled rearwardly to their final position and the lead portions 112 are staggered and pushed into their respective contact receiving slots 98. At the completion of the operation shown in Fig. 9, a finished carrier subassembly 40 is produced. The carrier subassembly 40 is then mounted into the housing 38 in the manner described above. Because of the accurate and firm positioning of the conductors 44 on the support member 42, many of the manufacturing operations can be performed simultaneously. Many of these operations had to be performed one at a time. Because of the efficiencies enjoyed by the structure of the jack assembly 10, the cost disadvantages of a two piece assembly disappear. In addition to the manufacturing economies, a vastly superior structure from a mechanical strength point of view is produced. The usual concerns regarding the retention of flat conductors to a one piece housing are eliminated. It is to be understood that although a printed circuit board mounted jack assembly has been disclosed herein, the present invention could be used for other types of jack assemblies. For example, instead of a printed circuit board, the lead portions of the conductors may be electrically connected to a wire either by crimping or insulation displacement.
