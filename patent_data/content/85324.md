# NYLON COMPOSITIONS AND RIM PROCESS FOR MAKING SAME

## Abstract
Nylon compositions are prepared by anionic polymeriza tion of at least 75 of a lactam with up to about 25 of an epoxy component in the presence of a basic catalyst and a promoter that can be used in lactam polymerization wherein, in a preferred embodiment, the epoxy component is a modified epoxy resin containing physical property enhanc ing constituents. The nylon compositions are prepared by mixing a fraction of a lactam with the epoxy component and the promoter to form liquid mixture A, mixing remaining lactam with the catalyst to form liquid mixture B, mixing liquid mixtures A, A and B in the ratio ranging from 1 1 to 4 1 to form liquid mixture C, injecting liquid mixture C into a mould maintained at a temperature of about 100 to 200 C wherein a chemical reaction takes place whereby the liquid is converted to a solidified mass in less than about 2 minutes, and removing the nylon composition in the form of a molded object.
