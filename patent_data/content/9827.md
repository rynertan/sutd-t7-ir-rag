# Line retrieving and dispensing device.

## Abstract
A set of travelling line guiding members 34 36 are moved relative to stationary line guiding members 30 32 with the two sets of line guiding members containing sepa rate individual wraps of partial loops of line. By moving the guiding members relatively toward and away from one another the line 39 can be quickly released when letting out line or retrieved for retracting a line. Wrap retaining devices are provided for releasably holding the wraps of line when in the retracted position after the movable line guiding mem bers are moved from the retracted position toward the fixed line guiding members.
