# Biological probes and methods of making same.

## Abstract
A biological probe having one or more electrodes 34, 36 on its exterior surface 20 for detecting electrical potentials such as electrocardiogram voltages. The exposed surfaces of the electrodes 34, 36 merge smoothly with the surrounding surfaces 20 of the probe to minimize tissue trauma. The elec trodes 34, 36 may be formed by applying and curing a liquid material on the probe body, and the electrodes 34, 36 may be electrically connected to conductors 12, 14 embedded in the probe by the same application and curing steps.
