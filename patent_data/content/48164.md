# Surgical evacuation device.

## Abstract
A surgical fluid evacuator comprises a flexible, com pressible reservoir which draws a substantially constant vacuum to permit uniform removal of fluid from a surgical incision through a wound drain catheter. The reservoir comprises a pair of congruent, articulated plates 10a, 10b having the area between them sealed from the atmosphere by a flexible membrane 40. A spring 14 between the plates 10a, 10b biases them apart to create a vacuum in the reservoir. As the reservoir, and spring, expands to draw fluid the articulated plates hinge to vary the shape of the reservoir to at least partially offset the decreasing force of the spring on the plates.
