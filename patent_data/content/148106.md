# Diminutive electrical connector.

## Abstract
A construction for a diminutive electrical connector, especially of the type having female type terminals, includes a connector body for supporting the terminals and a locking block structured to aid in retaining the terminals in the connector body and to provide a closure for openings or windows which would otherwise exist adjacent to the mating ends of the terminals. The connector body may also be provided with a lip which serves as a partial closure. Small openings through the closure provide access to the female terminals by male terminals, and are contoured to aid in guiding the relative insertion of the latter into the former.
