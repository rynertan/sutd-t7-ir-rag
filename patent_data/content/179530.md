# Noise dependent volume control having a reduced sensitivity to speech signals.

## Abstract
The noise dependent volume control in accordance with the invention is capable of distinguishing between the real background noise and speech in a space 8 . The gain A of the amplifier 1 is corrected only depending on the level of the background noise, so that once a difference in level be tween the background noise and a desired signal has been set this is maintained. The volume control is based on re peated measurements of the acoustic signal in the space 8 . If it appears that in at least one frequency range the measured energy content E
