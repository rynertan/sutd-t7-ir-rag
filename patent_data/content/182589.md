# Compatible polyimide resin blends, process for their preparation and their use.

## Abstract
Composition comprising from 5 to 95 phr of a polyepoxide or other resinous component, from 20 to 90 of an aprotic solvent, from 5 to 95 phr of a polyimide having sufficient amic acid functionality to be soluble in the solvent, and sufficient water to hydrolyze the polyimide. A laminate is made from the composition by heating it until the amic acid functionality is substantially eliminated, then impregnating a fibrous substrate with the composition, heating the impegnated substrate to evaporate the solvent and B stage the composition and form a prepreg, forming a stack of the prepregs, and heating and pressing the stack of prepregs to cure the composition. A wire enamel can also be made from the composition.
