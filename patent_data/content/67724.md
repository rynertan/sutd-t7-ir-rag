# An improved optical cable.

## Abstract
An optical cable suitable for suspension beside an electrical railway or other location where an electric com munication cable would be subjected to electrical interfer ence comprises an optical cable element 1 which is loosely housed in and extends helically throughout the length of an outer protective sleeve 7 which has embedded in and at spaced positions around the sleeve a plurality of elongate non metallic reinforcing members 6 which extend length wise of the sleeve. Each reinforcing member 6 has, in the member, undulations that serve to improve the mechanical bonding of the member within the sleeve 7 and the flexibility of the cable. The optical cable element 1 preferably compris es a plurality of plastics tubes 3 helically laid around a central non metallic reinforcing member 4 and surrounded by an outer sheath 5. In each of some of the tubes is loosely housed a separate optical fibre 2.
