# VACUUM SIGNAL REGULATOR

## Abstract
A Vacuum Signal integrator 10 is typically employed for processing and combining multiple vacuum input signals into a single output signal within the environment of a truck or auto mobile. The integrator, in a typical application, would input vac uum signals representative of throttle position, RPM, altitude and coolant temperature and output a vacuum signal equiva lent to the algebraic sum thereof to modulate a diesel EGR valve. Structurally, the integrator includes a housing 11 carry ing several conventional vacuum motors 32, 34 and 36 . Each vacuum motor applies a force to an idler bar 68 within the housing through reaction inserts 62, 94 and 96 , which is re presentative of a monitored input signal. The individual forces collectively applied to the idler bar generate a resultant or mo ment force thereon which is linked to a conventional vacuum modulator valve 38 through a vent insert 118 .
