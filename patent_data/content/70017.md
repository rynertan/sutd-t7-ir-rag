# Pattern detection system.

## Abstract
A pattern detection system for inspecting defects in fine or minute patterns such as photomask patterns at a fast speed is disclosed. The system comprises an illuminator 3, 4, 4 , a device 33 for moving objects with the patterns to be inspected with being illuminated by the illuminator, an optical system 6, 6 , 17, 17 , 18, 18 for imaging the objects, a scanner for scanning the objects in a direction intersected at a given angle with respect to direction of the objects moved by the moving device and arrays of photosensors 21, 21 arranged linearly in a direction perpendicular to that of images on the objects scanned by the scanner, on the surface of which the images are formed by the optical system and for producing respective outputs parallelly on the time basis.
