# Sealing and distributing device for containers of fluids.

## Abstract
The device comprises a distributing element 36 fas tened on to the container 34 and provided with a membrane part 39 connected to the lower end of a distributing tubular part 38 , which can assume, by means of the snap bending of the membrane 39 , a more inner rest position and a more outer distributing position. A sealing element 40 has a tubu lar part 42 suitable to be inserted inside the tubular part 38 of the distributing element 36 and protruding beyond it. On the protruding region an annular projection 44 is provided, which, during the axial motion of the sealing element 40 , which can be caused either by unscrewing or by pulling out, engages and drags the tubular part 38 of the distributing element 36 snapwise to the distributing position. The seal ing element 40 is then disengaged from the distributing element 36 . The engagement in correspondence of the lower end of the tubular part 38 , below the zone in which the membrane is connected, allows a stronger engagement for extraction purposes and a longer stroke of the distributing element 36 with a higher stability of the positions of it.
