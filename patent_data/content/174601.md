# Oil degradation warning system.

## Abstract
Herein disclosed is an oil degradation warning system which comprises several sensors 12b,12c,12d for sensing parameters which are closely related to degradation factors of the engine oil, a microcomputer 16 which processes the detected parameters to compute oil degradation coefficients of them in each factor, integrates the oil degradation coefficients in each factor with passage of time, and issues an instruction signal when at least one of the integrated values of the oil degradation coefficients exceeds a corres ponding reference value, and a warning device 20 which gives a warning when the instruction signal is applied thereto.
