# Lactulose purification process.

## Abstract
A process of purifying lactulose from other carbohy drates, in particular from lactose and galactose, by passing a lactulose syrup through one or more columns containing a bifunctionalised boron resin of the type By passing the lactulose solution containing carbohy drate impurities through a boron resin I of polyacrylic ma trix, the lactulose is selectively retained and is subsequently released by elution with an acid solution. The small quantity of galactose which may still be con tained in the lactulose enriched solution can be removed by passing said solution through a boron resin I of polystyrene matrix, which selectively retains the galactose.
