# Microcapsules containing a hydrophobic, volatile substance.

## Abstract
Microcapsules containing a hydrophobic, volatile sub stance, such as an organic solvent, perfume, agricultural chemical or insecticide, have a membrane wall comprising a polymeric material made by interfacial polymerization of a polyvalent isocyanate with a water soluble cationic urea resin and or an aminoresin prepolymer and a polymeric material made by polycondensing the water soluble cationic urea resin with the aminoresin prepolymer in the presence of an anionic surfactant with a molecular weight of less than 1000.
