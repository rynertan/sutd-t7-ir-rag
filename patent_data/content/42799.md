# ELECTROMAGNETIC FUEL INJECTOR

## Abstract
An electromagnetic fuel injector having an energizable stator means 10 for controlling the movement of a valve member of a valve assembly 10 to open and close the injector and thereby meter fuel, said valve assembly com prising a valve housing 30, 32 including a valve housing bore 92 terminating with a valve seat 56 which is connected to an exit orifice, a valve assembly 60 including a valve 60 reciprocally located in said valve housing bore, operable to close said exit orifice by sealing said valve seat 56 with a ball valve 60 , a swirl chamber 43 for imparting to the fuel flow exhausted from the exit orifice a swirl component that is tangential with respect to the spray axis of the injector, and means 40 for supplying fuel from a pressurized source to said swirl chamber, characterized in that said fuel supply means includes means 70 forming a hollow cylinder 42 of fuel between said source and said swirl chamber, and at least one orifice 52 communicating fuel between said fuel cylinder forming means 70 and said swirl chamber 43 .
