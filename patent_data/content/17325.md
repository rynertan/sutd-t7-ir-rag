# Speed adaptive conveyor drive for a glass manufacturing system.

## Abstract
A conveyor drive 24 for a glass manufacturing system transports a sheet of glass 12 through a tempering station 10 on a roller bed 36 . The conveyor drive 24 includes a pair of pulleys 28,30 mounted at opposed ends of the tempering station 10 . A continuous drive loop 26 is trained over the pair of pulleys 28,30 and engages the roller bed 36 so that rotational motion of the pulleys is imparted to the roller bed. One pulley 28 is driven by a motor 40 to transport the glass through the station. The other pulley 30 drives an electrical generator 42 connected to a dissipative load 44 . The generator 42 and load 44 provide an adaptive counter torque to the other pulley 30 in direct relation to its rotational speed. The counter torque stabilizes the conveyor drive 24 to prevent slip stick friction from disrupting the transport of the glass sheet 12 .
