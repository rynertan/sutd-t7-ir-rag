Sodium and calcium lignosulfonates have been used as binders for preparing briquettes of silicon and ferro silicon dust by Aitcin et al. in U.S. Patent 4,348,230 issued September 7, 1982 . Such briquettes do not contain either metal oxides or reducing agents. The agglomerates found in the prior art generally lack the physical strength to function well in the demanding environment of a blast, smelting, or electric arc furnace over the entire temperature range found in such environments. The prior art agglomerates generally lack sufficient strength at either low or high temperatures. The prior art agglomerates which possess sufficient strength at high temperatures generally do not possess sufficient strength at low temperatures.

This invention further relates to a method for the production of metals or metal alloys, said method comprising The agglomerates of this invention contain a material or materials capable of being reduced and or a carbonaceous reducing agent and a mixed binder system. The mixed binder system contains a primary binder and a secondary binder. The primary binder is selected from the group consisting of coal tar pitch, asphalt, and petroleum pitch. The coal tar pitch, asphalt, or petroleum pitch can be in various forms including powder, lump, melt, or aqueous emulsion. The preferred primary binder is coal tar pitch. The secondary binder is selected from the group consisting of lignosulfonate salts, carbohydrates, and silicates. Ligno sulfonate salts include calcium lignosulfonate, sodium lignosulfonate and ammonia lignosulfonate as well as other metallic and nonmetallic lignosulfonates. Suitable carbohydrates include sugars, starches, dextrans, glycogens, celluloses, alkylated celluloses, and pentosans. The preferred carbohydrates for use in this invention are the starches. Suitable silicates include nesosilicates, sorosilicates, cyclosilicates, inosilicates, phyllosilicates, orthosilicates, bentonites, clays, montmorillonites, cements, and the like. The preferred mixed binder system contains coal tar pitch as the primary binder and one or more lignosulfonate salts as the secondary binder. The most preferred mixed binder system contains coal tar pitch as the primary binder and calcium lignosulfonate as the secondary binder. The weight ratio of primary binder to secondary binder in the agglomerates of this invention can range from about 20 1 to 1 20. Preferably, the weight ratio of primary binder to secondary binder is in the range of 5 1 to 1 5. Most preferably, the weight ratio of primary binder to secondary binder is in the range of about 2 1 to 1 2. The agglomerates of this invention normally contain about 2 to 35 weight percent of the mixed binder system based on the total, dried weight of the agglomerate. Preferably, the agglomerates contains about 6 to 12 weight percent of the mixed binder system based on the total, dried weight of the agglomerate. The agglomerates of this invention contain, in addition to the mixed binder system, a material or materials capable of being reduced and or a carbonaceous reducing agent. The material or materials capable of being reduced are referred to as reductants. Suitable reductants include silica containing materials, iron oxide containing materials, nickel oxide containing materials, chromium oxide containing materials, fluorite containing materials, and alumina containing materials. Iron oxide containing materials include iron ores, cast iron and the like. Nickel oxide containing materials include nickel ores and the like. Chromium oxide containing materials include chromite ores and the like. Preferred reductants include silica containing materials alone and silica containing materials combined with iron oxide containing materials. Silica containing materials include silica, fumed silica, sand, and the like. Sand is one especially preferred silica containing material. Suitable carbonaceous reducing agents include coals, cokes, lignites, charcoals, lamp black, silicon carbide, vegetable matter such as straw, sawdust, wood chips, and rice hulls, and the like. Preferred reducing agents include coals, cokes, and charcoals. More than one reductant and or reducing agent may be present in the agglomerates of this invention. The reducants and reducing agents are normally present in the agglomerates of this invention at total, combined levels of 65 to 98 weight percent and preferably at 88 to 94 weight percent based on the total, dried weight of the agglomerate. The ratio of reductants to reducing agents in the agglomerates of this invention can vary widely. Agglomerates containing either reductants and the mixed binder system only or reducing agents and the mixed binder system only are considered within the scope of this invention. It is preferred, however, that the agglomerates of this invention contain both the reductant and the reducing agent in addition to the mixed binder system. It is preferred that the agglomerates of this invention contain the reductant and reducing agents in a weight ratio of about 2 1 to 1 2. It is preferred that there be at least a sufficient amount of reducing agent required to reduce all of the reductants present in the agglomerate. The ratios of reductants to reducing agents to primary binder to secondary binder can all vary from one individual agglomerate to another so long as the averages remain within the required ranges. The agglomerates of this invention can be formed using conventional processing techniques. It is often helpful in preparing the agglomerates of this invention to add water to the mixture of reductants, reducing agents, and mixed binder system before the agglomerates are actually formed. The water acts as a processing aid. Water may be added at levels up to about 20 weight percent based on the total weight of the agglomerate. After the agglomerate is formed, the processing water may be removed by drying. Drying temperatures of about room temperature to 100 C are preferred although higher temperatures may be used. It is not necessary to remove all of the processing water in a separate drying step since the remainder of the processing water will be removed in the furnace where the actual carbothermic reduction takes place. Any removal of water in the carbothermic reduction furnace is, for the purposes of this invention, considered part of the drying step. The agglomerates of this invention are prepared by mixing the various components together and then forming the agglomeratures using pressure. The amount of pressure needed will vary depending upon the actual components employed and other experimental conditions. Typical operating pressures might be in the range of 1500 3000 pounds, although higher or lower pressures may be used. Determination of the pressure needed to form a given agglomerate is best left to simple experimentation. The agglomerates of this invention may be in the form of pellets, briquettes, compression moldings, extrusions and the like. The agglomerates of this invention are intended to be used to prepare metals or metal alloys in a carbothermic reduction process. Such a process is carried out in a blast, smelting, or electric arc furnace. Suitable furnaces and the procedures of operating such furnaces are well known in the art. The actual metals or metal alloys produced will naturally depend upon the reductants present in the agglomerates. Preferred reductants are silica containing materials alone and silica containing materials combined with iron oxide containing materials. Therefore, the preferred metal produced by the process of this invention is silicon and the preferred metal alloy is a silicon iron alloy. Other metals and metal alloys may be produced by the carbothermic reduction process of this invention. Binary, tertiary, and higher order metal alloys can be produced in this process. So that those skilled in the art can better appreciate and understand the invention, the following examples are given. Unless otherwise indicated, all percentages are by weight. The following procedures were used in the examples The agglomerates were prepared using the following procedure. The raw materials were mixed in the presence of water in a Simpson Mix Muller obtained from National Engineering Co. of Chicago, Illinois. The mixed raw materials were then formed into agglomerates in a Model B 100 two roll hydraulic press from K. R. Komerak, Inc. of Elk Grove Village, Illinois, at a pressure of 2000 2700 psig. The pocketed rollers produced oval, pillow shaped agglomerates or briquettes with nominal dimensions of l 5 8 by 7 8 by 5 8 inches. The green briquettes were then cured or dried at room temperature about 25 C for 24 hours. The cured or dried briquettes were fired at 950 C for seven minutes in a covered crucible. The drop strength or drop loss of the various briquettes was determined by dropping the briquettes from a height of six feet. About ten briquettes are allowed to free fall onto a steel plate. All the material, both broken and unbroken, was collected and the drop repeated for a total of three drops. The percentage of dropped material which passed through a 3 mesh screen is reported as the drop loss. This test is similar to ASTM procedures D 440 and D 3038. Crush strengths were measured using a hardness tester form Nels Jorgenson and Co., St. Clair Shores, Michigan. An individual briquette was placed between two flat steel plates of the tester. The pressure on the briquette was slowly increased until the briquette fractured at which point the applied pressure was recorded. The reported crush strength was obtained by averaging the results over ten randomly selected briquettes. This test procedure is similar to ASTM D 3313. The tester limit was 190 pounds. Briquettes with crush strengths greater than this limit are reported as greater than 190 pounds. The following raw materials were used in the examples. d employed was Oklahoma No. 1 from Pennsylvania Glass Sand Corp. of Berkely Springs, West Virginia from a quarry located in Mill Creek, Oklahoma.
