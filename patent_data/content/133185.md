# Hydraulic control system for automatic transmission.

## Abstract
A hydraulic control system comprises first C3 and second fluid C2 operated friction units, the first fluid operated friction unit C3 being discharged at the same time the second fluid operated friction unit C2 is press urized during a shift between two remote speed ratios. The hydraulic control system comprises a drain conduit having one end communicable with the first fluid operated friction unit C3 and an opposite end, and a timing valve 26 which discharges the drain conduit via an orifice 602 when the fluid pressure supplied to the second fluid operated friction unit C2 is lower than a predetermined value, while it dis charges the drain conduit bypassing the orifice 602 when the fluid pressure supplied to the second fluid operated the friction unit C2 exceeds the predetermined value.
