## Abstract
A fuel rail assembly 10 for an engine has a pair of fuel rails 20, 22 connected by crossover 33 and discharge conduits 34 . The crossover and discharge conduits are secured to the fuel rails in a manner which permits relative motion between the fuel rails without loss of fuel from the fuel rail conduit intersection.
