The object of the invention is a luggage carrier of the car roof rack type, the luggage carrier consisting of an extend able beam, which is constituted by two telescopically in relation to each other displacable, pipe shaped portions 1a, 1b and which has a support leg 2a, 2b at each end. The invention is characterized in that a clamp for fastening the support leg to a rain gutter or a corresponding projection at the corresponding side of a car roof is constituted a first and a second shank 3 4 and 5 , respectively , of which the first shank is positioned inside the support leg and extends out through an opening in the support leg with an end portion formed as a hook 4 and extends with its opposite end into the beam and is connected with a block 6 16 displacable in the beam, while the other shank of the clamp is constituted by an outer lower end portion 5 of the support leg. The two blocks 6 16 of the beam are displacable in the direction against and away from each other by means of an elongated bolt 8 positioned in the beam and extending in the longitudinal direction thereof. One end of the bolt is accessible through an open beam end for a tool for rotating the bolt, by means of which the two beam portions are displacable in relation to each other and the two blocks are displacable in the direction towards and away from each other while moving said first shanks 4 with them for fastening the two clamps against and around the rain gutters. In order to prevent theft the open beam end through which the bolt is accessible is connected by means of a cup in the form of a flap rotatably connected with the beam, the flap being lockable to the corresponding support leg 2a by means of a lock 21 which is lockable by means of a key 20 .
