# Method and apparatus for disposal of weft yarn in a jet loom.

## Abstract
In a jet loom measured lengths of weft yarn 44 are in serted by fluid actuation into a shed delimited between the upper and lower warp yarns. When stop signals for the loom are sensed, the weft yarn about to be inserted into the shed is deflected by a suction device 61 from its normal course and thus inhibited from entering the warp shed until the time of complete stop of the operation of the loom, which is braked. After the termination of braking, the moving components of the loom are operated in reverse and brought in this manner to a predetermined angular position of one weaving cycle. With the loom resting in this position, the last inserted weft yarn is disposed of.
