# Device for compressing a more or less loosely coherent mass into a packet.

## Abstract
The invention has for its object to contruct a com pression device in a manner such that force alterations will due to reciprocating movement of parts occur hardly or not at all and, moreover disturbances of the equi librium which might give rise to shaking or rocking of the device cannot occur. A further object of the invention is to provide a device in which the compressing operation takes place substantially continuously so that in addition the pro duction of noise can be limited to a very low level. In order to achieve the above mentionel objects the invention proposes a device of the kind set forth in the preamble which comprises a stock container 2 having an inlet opening 3 , an intermediate wall 5 movable inside said stock container 2 away from and towards said opening 3 and subjected to pressure in the direc tion toward said opening and a pressing member 6 for a pressurized supply of said mass to the inlet opening.
