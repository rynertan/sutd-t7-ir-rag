# Living polymers and chain transfer regulated polymerization process.

## Abstract
Improved process of polymerizing a polar monomer with selected initiators and catalysts, the improvement consisting of having present a chain transfer agent having a pKa greater than 18 but less than 25 and containing at least one reactive hydrogen atom which terminates the growth of living polymer.
