# Control for automobile air conditioning system.

## Abstract
An automobile air conditioning system is provided with a control system for controlling the flow rate of hot or cool air discharged into the passenger compartment. In this control system, the air flow rate is increased with an increase of the absolute value of the temperature difference between a predetermined reference temperature and a room tempera ture of the compartment detected by a sensor, and is decreased with a decrease of the absolute value.
