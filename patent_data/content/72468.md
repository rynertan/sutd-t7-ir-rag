# Method for filter press cell assembly.

## Abstract
A method for assembling a filter press type of electroly tic cell is disclosed wherein tightening apparatus is em ployed at preferably multiple points about the periphery of the stacked electrodes to substantially simultaneously apply a substantially uniform pressure to compress the cell to permit the compressed stack of electrodes to be retained in this compressed state while the cell is assembled in a fluid tight manner.
