# Gauging head for checking dimensions of workpieces.

## Abstract
A gauging head comprises a casing 1 two gauging arms 4,5 , pivotable about pins 2,3 fixed to the casing 1 , and carrying feelers 8,9 for contacting the workpiece 10 to be checked two position transducers 15,20 coupled to the gauging arms 4,5 a second pair of arms 13,14 pivotable about the pins 2,3 and zero setting devices. In order to permit quick zero setting of the gauging head without affecting its accuracy and repeatability, the zero setting devices include two members 29,30 coupled to a shaft 23 rotatable by a control lever 28 . In a first position of the lever 28 the members 29,30 are locked and the head is in gauging condition. In a second position of the lever 28 the members 29,30 are unlocked and can translate along the shaft 23 permitting to carry out the zero setting operation because the arms 4,5 engage the members 29,30 in such a way that the arms 4,5 can rotate about the pins 2,3 while maintaining a determined setting of the transducers 15,20 .
