# Nutating snap action switch apparatus.

## Abstract
Principally useful for keyboard switch data entry de vices, the apparatus operates by means of cammed sur faces to produce a generally nutating, rocking snap action. Depression of the key button 1 moves a stem 2 with cam surfaces 9, 10, 11, 15, 16 on it which contact cammed surfaces 6, 7, 8, 14 on a rocking plate mechanism 5 . The action produces a first rocking motion in a first axis followed by second and third combined snapping and rocking actions about second and third axes in that plane, but a different angular orientations from the first action. A hypothetical vertical axis constructed through the planar base 12 of the rocking mechanism 5 will nutate or precess in a generally orbital fashion about a central pivot point. The motion of the planar base 12 may be easily coupled to any of a variety of transducer devices which may be contacts, capacitive, optical or inductive.
