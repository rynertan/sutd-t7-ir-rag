# Colour cathode ray tube including a channel plate electron multiplier.

## Abstract
A colour cathode ray tube including a screen 16 comprising at least two sets of phosphor stripes luminescing in different primary colours. A channel plate electron multiplier 44 is mounted parallel to, but spaced from, the screen 16 . The electron multiplier 44 comprises a stack of juxtaposed substantially planar apertured dynodes DI to Dn with the apertures therein aligned to form channels. An apertured extractor electrode 48 is mounted on the output side of the electron multiplier 44 . Preferably two or more foraminous deflector electrodes 50, 52 are mounted on the extractor electrode. The apertures in the foraminous deflector electrodes 50, 52 have the same pitch as the channels of the electron multiplier but are offset laterally relative to each other and to the axes A of the channels by amounts which allow the emergent electron beam from each channel to pass through to the screen 16 without impinging upon the deflector electrodes 50, 52 . By applying a potential difference between the deflector electrodes 50, 52 an electron beam emerging from its respective channel is deflected laterally onto a respective one of its associated group of phosphor stripes. The apertures in the deflector electrodes 50, 52 may be circular, elliptical or polygonal for example square, rectangular or hexagonal.
