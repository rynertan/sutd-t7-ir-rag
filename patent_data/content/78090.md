# Method and device for controlling the cuff pressure in measuring the blood pressure in a finger by means of a photo electric plethysmograph.

## Abstract
A method for controlling the cuff pressure in the indirect, non invasive, continuous measurement of blood pressure in a finger by using a photo electric plethysmograph in a fluid filled pressure cuff, an electronic control circuit and an electric pressure valve, the cuff pressure being controlled by the plethysmographic signal in closed loop operation by means of a servo reference level, so that the arterial volume is maintained at a value to be pre adjusted, whereby for the initial adjustment, the cuff pressure or the servo reference level as initial adjustment quantity is automatically changed continously in the control range by means of a control wave form to be supplied into the electronic control circuit, that thereby the peak through amplitude of the pulsatile plethys mographic signal or cuff pressure signal is detected time and again, and compared with the preceding peak trough ampli tude, the biggest value thereof in the control range and the associated value of the cuff pressure at servo reference level being stored, which value of cuff pressure or servo reference at the end of the initial adjustment is used as set value for the measurement of the blood pressure.
