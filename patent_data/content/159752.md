## Description
Protective cover . The invention relates to a protective cover for a shaver, as known fran, for example, German Gebrauchsmuster 75 17 402. A shaver equipped with such a protective cover is used mainly when travelling or on holidays. The invention aims at extending the use of such a shaver. The cover in accordance with the invention is characterized in that the cover accatodates a battery operated clock 5 having a display which can be read through a window in the wall of the cover. An emBodiment of the invention will now be described in more detail, by way of example, with reference to the drawings. Fig. 1 is a perspective view of a shaver with a hinged cover, which is shown open in this view. Fig. 2 shows the shaver of Fig. 1 with the cover closed. The shaver shown in Fig. 1 comprises a housing 1 having a shaving head 2 with two shaving units 3. The protective cover 4 is pivotally connected to the housing 1 by a hinge 12. This cover 4 comprises a cam partment 5 for a battery operated clock and a space 6 for receiving the shaving head 2. In the closed position of the cover shown in Fig. 2, the shaving head 2 is situated in the space 6 in the cover 4, so that the shaving units 3 are covered. In this way the shaving units 3 are protected against damage when the shaver is carried on journeys or holidays. The cover also protects the shaviny units 3 against the penetration of dust. The clock, which together with a battery is accomcdated in the compartment 5, may be a digital quartz clock. The clock has a display 8 which can be read thrcugh a window 7 in the wall of the cover. The clock can be set by means of buttons 9 in the wall of the cover 4. The clock is equipped with an alarm mechanism which can be actuated by means of an alarm button 10, thereby enabling the assembly to be used as a travelling alarm clock. The housing 1 of the shaver carries an on off switch 11. If the housing 1 of the shaver also accatodates an electric pcr wer source, for example a battery for driving the shaver, the clock may also be electrically connected to this per source in those versions in which the cover is permanently attached to the shaver, for example as in the embodiment shown in Figs. 1 and 2. In that case electrical connections are arranged between the shaver housing and the cover. In the embodiment shown in Figs. 1 and 2 the housing 1 and the cover 4 are manufactured from a plastics as a o e piece moulded product with an integral hinge 12. It is obvious that the invention may also be used in the case of a cover which is not pivotally connected to the shaver but which is a de tachable and only covers the shaving units 3.
