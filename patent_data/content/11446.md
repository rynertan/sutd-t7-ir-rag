# A frequency characteristic adjusting circuit.

## Abstract
A frequency characteristic adjusting apparatus compris ing a filter circuit formed of a first variable gain amplifier 8 and a capacitor C2 , a second variable gain amplifier 12 for amplifying an output signal from the filter circuit, an amp lifier 10 for amplifying a signal denoting a difference bet ween the amplitudes of an input signal to the filter circuit and an output signal therefrom, and an adder circuit 14 for adding together output signals from the second variable gain amplifier 12 and difference signal amplifier 10 , and wherein the first and second gain amplifiers 8, 12 are con nected to potentiometers 20, R3, R4 , and the gains of the first and second variable gain amplifiers 8, 12 are varied in accordance with changes in the voltage supplied from the potentiometers 20, R3, R4 to the amplifiers 8, 12 , while maintaining the prescribed relationship between the gains of the first and second variable gain amplifiers 8, 12 .
