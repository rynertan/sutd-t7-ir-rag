# A commutating device for driving a load.

## Abstract
A commutating device for driving a load wherein a main supply voltage is converted into positive and negative buffer voltages which are converted into a control voltage for application to at least one load and wherein the fre quency of the control voltage is controlled by means of commutation of the buffer voltages by means of a main thyristor TH1 and a commutation circuit including an auxiliary thyristor TH1a and a commutation circuit includ ing an auxiliary thyristor TH1b provided for each of the positive and negative buffer voltages. At least one additio nal commutation circuit TH1b, D1b, C1b, L1b including an auxiliary thyristor TH1b , and typically plural additional commutation circuits TH1c, D1c, C1c, L1c, TH1d, D1d, C1d, L1d , are connected in parallel to the firstly noted commutation circuit with the conduction periods of the several commutation circuits being determined on the ba sis of the polarity and level of the current to the load.
