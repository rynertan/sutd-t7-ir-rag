# Method of selectively etching openings in a material of variable thickness.

## Abstract
The method includes a first etch step in which a material 14 having variable thickness and being deposited on a substrate of a different material 12 is isotropically etched through a mask having at least one opening 18, 20 , the detection of the initial end point at which a portion of said material 14 is completely eched away at some location, and a second etch step in which the remainder of said given material 14 is anisotropically etched until it has been completely removed from all etch locations. Preferably the etching is by dry plasma etching and the first end point is detected by monitoring the change in concentration of a reactive species. The change is sharply defined by taking a second derivative of the curve of the change in intensity of the peak of the sensed species. The openings etched into said material 14 by using the inventive method have curved walls and the bottom part of the walls is exactly in vertical alignment with the corresponding openings 18, 20 in the etch mask.
