# Magnetic coating comprising electron beam curable polyurethanes.

## Abstract
Electron beam curable polyurethane resin comprising the reaction product of a hydroxyl terminated polyester a compound having ethylenic unssaturation and at least 2 hydroxyl moieties optionally, a chain extender which is a lower aliphatic or cycloaliphatic diol and an approximately stoichiometric proportion of an aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, or aromatic diisocyanate. The ethylenically unsaturated compo nent has an essentially aliphatic backbone, and optionally can include carbamate linkages. Magnetic coatings incorpor ating these resins are adapted to be applied to a substrate, calendared, then crosslinked by exposure to electron beam radiation. Magnetic media made with such coatings are also disclosed.
