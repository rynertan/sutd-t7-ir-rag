# Shielded header and assembly.

## Abstract
A shielded header serves to establish electrical connection between a cable 18 mounted to a cable connector 12 and a printed circuit board 34 and restricts the emission of elec tromagnetic energy. The header utilises a dielectric housing 16 with electrical contact pins 14, 14a mounted therein. The header is efficiently grounded to the cable connector 12 and a chassis 78 carrying the printed circuit board 34 by means of a ground strip 36 attached to the housing lower sur face and spring contacts 44 mounted to engage the cable connector 12 inside the housing and the chassis 78 and printed circuit board 34 outside the housing.
