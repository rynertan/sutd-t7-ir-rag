# An ignition system for subsidiarily starting a diesel engine.

## Abstract
An engine auxiliary start igniton system for a multi cylinder diesel engine which forcedly ignites an air fuel mixture supplied into each combustion chamber after actuation of an engine starter motor, preferably when an engine cooling water temperature is below a predetermined value. The engine auxiliary start system is continuously actuated, at least until the engine has achieved a spontaneous ignition state or preferably until a predetermined period of time after the engine has achieved the spontaneous ignitable state. A detecting means for detecting the spontaneous ignition state of the engine includes a a combustion pressure detecting means which detects combustion pressure within a combustion chamber and outputs a signal when the combustion pressure exceeds a predetermined value, b an engine speed detecting means which detects engine speed and outputs a signal when the engine speed exceeds a predetermined value c an oxygen concentration detecting means which detects the concentration of oxygen in exhaust gas and outputs a signal when the concentration of oxygen exceeds a predetermined value d an engine starter motor stop detecting means which outputs a signal indicating that the starter motor has stopped e an exhaust gas temperature detecting means which detects exhaust gas temperature and outputs a signal when the exhaust gas temperature exceeds a predetermined value or f an engine cooling water temperature detecting means which detects engine cooling water temperature and outputs a signal when the engine cooling water temperature exceeds another predetermined value. When the engine auxiliary start system receives the output signal from any of the ignition state detecting means, the ignition system for auxiliary starting the diesel engine stops so that air fuel mixture is ignited stably without misfire and the engine revolves smoothly.
