## Description
TITLE Hollow Fiber Plasmapheresis Module and Process TECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to plasmapheresis using microporous hollow fibers. BACKGROUND INFORMATION Plasmapheresis is a process of separating plasma from whole blood. The plasma depleted blood is comprised principally of cellular components, e.g., red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets.Plasma is comprised largely of water, but also contains proteins and various other non cellular compounds, both organic and inorganic. Plasmapheresis is currently used to obtain plasma for various transfusion needs, e.g., preparation of fresh frozen plasma for subsequent fractionation to obtain specific proteins such as serum albumin, to produce cell culture media, and for disease therapies involving either the replacement of plasma or removal of specific disease contributing factors from the plasma. Plasmapheresis can be carried out by centrifugation or micro filtration. Microfiltration apparatus generally utilize microporous membranes. The pores are cell retaining pores, that is, the pores substantially retain cellular components but allow plasma to pass through. Typically, cell retaining pores are of substantially uniform diameter and are of a size within the range 0.1 to 1.0 micrometer, that is, between membranes the ore size is within this range, but in any single membrane the pores are of substantially the same size. Various planar membrane devices are disclosed in the literature. These include various configurations of membranes and flow paths. In general, microporous hollow fibers are being increasingly used. Gurland et al., in a paper presented at the 1981 annual meeting of the American Society for Artificial Internal Organs, reported that three hollow fiber plasma pheresis modules were commercially available. These are the Plasmaflo 01, plasmaflo 02 and Plasmaflux, the first two utilizing cellulose diacetate membranes with a maximum pore size of 0.2 vm, and the third, utilizing polypropylene with a maximum pore size of 0.5 urn. Other features are listed below. Effective Effective Wall Lumen length surface thickness Module urn cm M2 urn Plasma flo 01 370 about 20 0.65 160 Plasma flo 02 330 about 20 0.5 60 Plasma flux 330 about 20 0.5 140 Continuous plasmapheresis , as the term is used herein, is the process of continuously separating plasma fro whole blood. Thus, as the term is used herein, continuous plasmapheresis , and the apparatus needed to carry out a continuous plasmapheresis, must be able to provide, from whole blood, sufficient plasma, for example, at least about 500 mL, in a relatively sht time, for example, 15 minutes to 3 hours, without substantial fouling of the membrane pores.The whole blood used in this invention either can be provided directly by a donor or patient or it can first be collected from a donor or patient and subsequently i ntroduced into the apparatus of this invention, for exarnple, from a reservoir. It is an object of this invention to provide a hollow fiber plasmapheresis module which provides a high rate of plasma collection per unit area of membrane and which thus requires a small extracorporeal blood volume and a small surface area of membrane material, considered a foreign material to the blood. Another object is to provide such a module which not only provides a high plasma flux but also a high hematocrit in the plasma depleted fraction. A further object is to provide a module which can operate continuously for longer periods of time than conventional plasmapheresis modules, thus making it suitable for use in continuous plasmapheresis. Another object is to provide such a module which is easy to assemble and easy to use without making extensive adjustments. A further object is to provide a plasmapheresis process employing hollow fiber membranes.Other objects will become apparent hereinafter. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figure 1 is a flow diagram which shows the hollow fiber module of the invention as it may be used with attendant communicating apparatus in carrying out a continuous plasmapheresis in either the steady state recycle or pulsed flow mode of the invention.Figure 2 is an enlarged view of a part of Figure 1 to snow the direction of blood flow in the recycle mode of the invention. Figure 3 shows the direction of blood flow on the forward stroke of the pulser pump in the pulsed flow mode of the invention, and Figure 4 shows the direction of blood flow on the reverse stroke in this mode of operation. Figure 5 snows the variation of transmembrane pressure difference with variation of membrane pore size thus a higher transmembrane pressure difference can be. tolerated as the pore size is decreased. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Patent I 82303831.0 Publlcation o. In European Application No. are dis 0070738 closed and claimed process and apparatus for carrying out plasmapheresis using reciprocatory pulsatile blood flow across a porous membrane, such as a flat membrane or hollow fibers. The instant invention involves the use of hollow fibers but, unlike the earlier in ention, the flow of blood across the membrane can be either of the reciprocatory pulsatile type or of the steady state type. The steady state type invention also includes a variation wherein a recycle blood flow is employed.Figure 1 depicts an apparatus for carrying out either the steady state recycle or pulsed flow mode of the invention. Such an apparatus without the left pump and recycle loop can be used on carry out the steady state mode of the invention. The invention herein resides in a hollow fiber plasmapheresis module comprising hollow fibers having cell retaining pores and an effective length substantially less than that commonly used in the art, within a housing having a blood inlet for conducting blood to the fibers, an outlet for conducting exit plasma depleted blood from the fibers, and a plasma outlet for conducting plasma out of the module. The invention also resides in a process for using the aforesaid module for carrying out a plasmapheresis, especially on a continuous basis on a human subject. The immediately following discussion is directed to the mechanics of steady state, recycle and reciprocatory pulsatile flow pulsed flow embodiments of the invention. Variables with each flow mode and their relationship to module performance are also discussed. STEADY STATE FLOW PLASMAPHERESIS The most desirable microporous hollow fiber plasmapheresis device removes the largest amount of plasma in the least amount of time, given the limited blood flow rate available from the patient. In this type of unit operating in the steady state flow mode, whole blood is pumped to one end of the fibers. As the blood flows through the fibers some of the plasma escapes through the pores, leaving blood at the outlet with a slightly elevated hematocrit. An adjustable clamp, valve or pump can be placed on the blood outlet line to maintain the desired level of pressure within the module. A problem with steady state flow is the interrelationship of outlet hematocrit and the quantity of plasma produced. Time is necessary for the plasma to be forced out through the pores. Faster blood flow rates allow more plasma to be produced, but a larger volume of whole blood is needed. The net result is that the hematocrit is lower than is obtained with slower blood flow rates. The optimum operating conditions thus depend on the goals set for the particular module. High hematocrit goals dictate a lower optimum blood flow rate, whereas peak plasma production requires faster blood flow rates. Under steady state flow conditions the best mode represents a compromise of these parameters. RECYCLE FLOW A variation of the steady state mode is the recycle flow mode wherein the flow of whole blood is augmented with some of the higher hematocrit blood that exits the fibers. A tubing loop and a pump are added to the device to recycle the higher hematocrit blood. This is shown in Figures 1 and 2. Figure 2 depicts the flow of blood in the tubing loop as going in a direction from the region of the module outlet to the region of the module inlet. It is to be understood that the recycle pump can also be installed so that the flow of blood in the tubing loop goes in the reverse direction. In the recycle mode, the velocity of blood flowing through the module is increased, which in turn enhances plasma production. This result is achieved without increasing the flow rate of the blood, for example, from the patient.The hematocrit of the incoming blood thus is increased before it enters the fibers due to the mixing of the inlet blood supply and the blood in the recycle loop which has already been filtered. By utilizing the recycle flow mode a higher hematocrit and increased plasma production, as compared to steady state flow, can be realized. However, under this mode of operation the hematocrit and plasma production decrease with increasing time of operation.The cause of this deterioration of results is related to blockage of the membrane pores by the blood cells, as will be described below. It is generally recognized in the art that the rate of plasma flow through the pores of the fiber flux density is usually not dependent on the transmembrane pressure TMP as long as the TMP is within certain limits the plateau region . Below about 50 mm of Hg pressure plasma flow rises sharply with increasing pressure, as it does above about 175 mm ofHg pressure above about 175 mm of Hg, however, there is grave risk of hemolysis. For a recycle flow plasmapheresis unit to be economically and medically acceptable, it should be operated in this plateau region . Classical fluid mechanics equations can be written to demonstrate that the transmembrane pressure varies along the length of the fiber. Initially, plasma production is greatest in the area of the fiber membrane near the whole blood inlet the upper end of the fibers where the transmembrane pressure is in the plateau region.This pressure drops along the length of the fiber, falling to 0 mm of Hg, and then below 0 with packed cell pumping , near the outlet the lower end of the fibers for the plasma depleted blood also referred to herein as packed cells , filtered blood ona Xcellular enriched blood. Tnis negative .HP draws some of the plasma that was forced through the pores along the upper end of the fibers back through the pores along the lower end of the fibers, resulting in a decrease in net plasma production. Thus, the long term performance of a plasmapheresis unit operated in the recycle flow mode can be subject to the adverse effects of negative TMP. In addition, the long term performance of the recycle mode is deficient due to another factor. As the module operation continues, some cellular components of the blood are drawn to the fiber pores with the plasma flow and block the pores, preventing further plasma flow through the pores. This pore blockage begins in the region of the fiber that experiences the highest transmembrane pressure, generally the region closest to the whole blood inlet. As the pores in this region become blocked, plasma flows through the next available open pores, in which event additional pore blockage takes place. Pore blockage continues down the fiber until all the pores are blocked. Pore blockage may be diminished, either by decreasing the inlet blood flow or by decreasing the transmembrane pressure. Either method undesirably reduces the plasma output and increases the time necessary for carrying out the plasmapheresis. RECIPROCATORY PULSATILE FLOW In this mode, also referred to as pulsed flow, the advantage of recycle flow, that is, increased blood velocity through the fibers, is retained, while the problem of cellular deposition in the pores is diminished. To operate in the pulsed flow mode, a tubing loop is included in the plasmapheresis unit to connect the two ends of the module, as shown in Figure 1. This loop includes a pulser pump which periodically reverses direction at a preselected frequency. The pump alternately draws blood from the exit efferent end of the unit and pumps it into the whole blood inlet afferent end of the unit on a forward stro te Figure 3 , then reverses direction and draws blood from the afferent end of the module and pumps it into the efferent end on a reverse stroke Figure 4 .Along with the frequency, the length and or velocity of each stroke can be set, these variables being useful in controlling the volume of blood passing through the loop. The volunxnof blood passing through the loop on the forward and reverse strokes need not be the same, and preferably are not the same. The volume of blood being pulsed in the system on the either stroke is at least 5 , preferably at least 10 , of the total volume of blood in the system. On the forward stroke when the inlet whole blood and the filtered higher hematocrit blood meet at the afferent end of the module, they are fornd through the fibers under an increased pressure. At the efferent end of the module the blood is under less pres sure and, in fact, this decreased pressure may, for example, as described hereinafter for a preferred embodiment, result in a partial vacuum. When the direction of the pulser pump is reversed, blood from the blood supply and from the module flows to the pulser loop and a partial vacuum may resuit at the afferent end of the module. Vacuum formation can be controlled by proper adjustment of a back pressure valve on the filtered blood outlet line. This valve, properly adjusted, is also useful in optimizing vacuum formation on the forward pump stroke. The blood exiting the pulser loop at the efferent end of the module can either flow up through the module or out through the filtered blood outlet. The net result is a smaller total flow through the module during the reverse stroke. Thus, the afferent end of the module and the forward stroke are the most efficient parts of the plasmapheresis unit for this mode of operation, and for this reason, it is preferred that the volume of liquid from the pulser loop be greater on the forward stroke than on the reverse stroke. Further regarding the operation of the pulper pump on the forward stroke, the liquid required to fill the pulsar loop can come from three sources 1 the filtered blood exit line, 2 the filtered blood just exiting the fibers, and 3 back flow of plasma through the fiber pores. The amount provided by each source depends on the relative resistances to flow. During normal operation the afore said back pressure valve is closed far enough to maintain a peak transmembrane pressure of 75 130 mm of Hg at the afferent end of the module consequently, back flow from the filtered blood exit line will be minimal.Ideally, the pulser loop should be filled mostly with filtered blood exiting the fibers, with only a minimum back flow of plasma, to maintain clean pores but not seriously diminish the output of plasma. This desired balance can be achieved in part by adjusting the ratio of effective fiber length to lumen diameter L D ratio . Using too high an L D ratio may lead to an undesirable reduction in the flow of filtered blood from the fibers, thus diminishing plasma production. High L D ratios are also undesirable because the resistance to blood flow is so great that unacceptably high pressures may be necessary to maintain flow the high pressure may cause hemolysis see Figure S which shows the effect of pore size on allowable transmembrane pressure . As indicated above, the reversible pulser pump can be adapted to vary any or all of the frequency of stroke, the length of the stroke, the velocity of the stroke. In a preferred embodiment the pulser pump is operated so that the volume of liquid passing through the loop on the forward stroke of the pump is greater than the volume of liquid going through the loop on the reverse stroke. The aforesaid discussion presumes that the whole blood inlet and the plasma depleted blood outlet of the module are used as such during the entire plasmapheresis carried out therein. It is to be understood, however, that this need not be, since the module can be operated in a cyclic fashion such that the functions of the inlet and outlet are periodically reversed. GENERAL DISCUSSION The module for carrying out a plasmapheresis in accordance with any of the aforesaid three modes of operation may be described as an improved microfiltration module for separating whole blood into a cellularenriched fraction and a plasma enriched fraction, the module comprising in combination a plurality of porous, blood wettable hollow fibers having pores capable of passing plasma but not cellular components, the fibers being further characterized in that the pore size is within the range 0.1 to 1.0 urn, preferably 0.4 to 0.6 pm, and the lumen diameter D is no more than 0.050 cm, preferably D is 0.015 to 0.050 cm, the fibers being of substantially equal lengths and terminating in first open ends and second open ends a liquid tight housing to contain the fibers liquid tight sealing means cooperating with the housing and the first open ends of the fibers liquid tight sealing means cooperating with the housing and the second open ends of the fibers, the two sealing means dividing the housing into two end chambers and one central chamber, the end chambers being in liquid transfer relationship with each other through the hollow fibers blood inlet means for introducing whole blood into one end chamber blood outlet means for removing a cellular enriched plasma depleted blood fraction from the other end chamber and plasma outlet means for removing a plasmaenriched blood fraction from the central chamber, the improvement characterized in that the effective length L of each fiber is not greater than 16,400 cm l D2, that is, the L D ratio is no greater than 16,400 cm 1 D L andD being in centimeters . Effective length is defined as that portion of the fiber, between the ends, through which plasma passes. Excluded from the effective length, therefore, are those portions of the fibers, at the ends, embedded in the sealing means, for example, a potting resin.It is to be understood regarding the aforesaid ranges of membrane pore size that the porous membrane fibers used herein have pores which are substantially uniform in size and that the substantially uniform size must be within the recited ranges At D 0.033 cm with the aforesaid L D ratio, in carrying out the pulsed flow mode of the invention, it has been found that the use of hollow fibers having an L D ratio of not greater than about 540, and especially those having an L D ratio of about 100 to about 350, can provide high plasma flux, that is, rate of plasma collection Qp , with high outlet hematocrit hct , that is, volume percent of red blood cells in the plasma depleted blood which is collected. In the steady state mode of the invention, the L D ratio should not be greater than about 300, preferably about 100 to about 300.In the recycle mode of the invention, theL D ratio should not be greater than about 460, preferably about 100 to about 350. In general, the lower the L D ratio within the aforesaid ranges the more satisfactory are the results achieved. The rate of collection of plasma depleted exit blood is referred to hereafter as Qpc High plasma flux is advantageous because it permits carrying out a plasmapheresis with a small extracorporeal blood volume. It is also advantageous because it pe mlts carrying out such treatment while exposing the blood to a minimum area of fiber membrane and associated apparatus foreign substances to the blood . The fibers should be wettable by the blood and are preferably hydrophilic. The walls should be thin since permeability generally increases as wall thickness decreases. The hollow fibers can be comprised of materials commonly available for such use, that is, materials which are or can be made biocompatible, permeable and blood wettable. These include, particularly, polymeric materials such as polyesters, polyamides, polycarbonates, polysulfones, methacrylate polymers, acrylonitrile polymers, and polypropylene which has been suitably treated to achieve the requisite wettability. Such hollow fibers can be prepared by known techniques. These include, for example, the techniques disclosed by Castro, U.S. Patent 4,247,498 and Gerlach et al., British Specification 2,026,381A. The module, which comprises fibers, potted in a resin, within a housing, can also be prepared by known techniques. The housing, which can be of any convenient shape, for example, cylindrical, should be made from a blood compatible material, such as poly methyl methacrylate . A blood inlet port is located near one end of the housing, for conducting whole blood into the hollow fibers, and an outlet port, for collecting plasma depleted cellular enriched blood, is located near the other end. A third port, a plasma outlet port, is used for collection of plasma which passes through the walls of the fibers.The module provides high plasma flux and high outlet hematocrit with small extracorporeal blood volume and small fiber membrane surface area. Preferably, the module includes means for conducting the blood through the fibers in reciprocating pulsatile flow pulsed flow , as described in my earlier applications and hereinabove. Such means include, for example, a blood circulating loop between an inlet and an outlet, there being an oscillator located on the loop. The inlet and outlet for connection to the oscillator can be the same as or different than the inlet and outlet used for feeding blood and collecting plasma depleted blood, respectively. The use of hollow fibers in this invention provides numerous advantages over the use of flat membranes. Some advantages are the use of hollow fibers provides a large amount of membrane area in a small volume of space the hollow fibers do not require membrane plasma drainplates hollow fibers provide an excellent geometric configuration for achieving a uniform flow across the membrane hollow fibers can be produced economically, as can the housing for the fibers and no restraining clamps or heavy casings are required for hollow fiber housings. Conveniently, the module containing hollow fibers can be purged of air, filled with saline and stored ready for use using techniques routinely used with hemodialysis modules. Still another advantage of the hollow fiber module of this invention is that it is reusable, at least once, particularly in the pulsed flow mode of operation.For example, the wettable polypropylene fibers used in the examples hereinafter were cleaned readily using dilute aqueous sodium hypochlorite. The pulsed flow mode of the invention is superior to both steady state and recycle flows because it removes more plasma per unit area of membrane in a shorter period of time. In addition, the unit can operate continuously for a longer time than the other modes. Moreover, using the pulsed flow system provides several attractive advantages to both the user and the manufacturer. A small unit with fewer fibers can outperform the presently available steady state flow units. The user also benefits from shorter treatment time, smaller extracorporeal volume of blood needed, reduced exposure of the blood to foreign surfaces and reduced module cost. The steady state mode of the invention can be described as an improved method for plasmapheresis carried out in a system with a plurality of blood wettable porous membrane hollow fibers having open inlet ends and open outlet ends, each fiber having a lumen diameter D of no greater than 0.050 cm, preferably 0.015 to 0.050 cm, the pore size of the porous membrane being within the range 0.1 to 1.0 Vm, preferably 0.4 to 0.6 pm, the improved method comprising a conducting blood in a forward direction into and through the fibers while maintaining a mean positive transmembrane pressure difference across the membranes from inlets to outlets of the hollow fibers b collecting plasma depleted blood from the outlets of the hollow fibers and c collecting plasma which has passed through the pores of the membranes, the effective length of the hollow fibers being such that the L D ratio is no greater than 16,400 cm 1 D L and D being in centimeters and the velocity of the blood in step a being such that the shear rate is 50 to 2500 sec l, preferably 90 to 100 sec 1. The recycle mode of the invention can be described as an improved method for plasmapheresis carried out in a system with a plurality of blood wettable porous membrane hollow fibers having open inlet ends and open outlet ends, each fiber having a lumen diameter D of no greater than 0.050 cm, preferably 0.us5 to 0.050 cm, the pore size of the porous membrane being within the range 0.1 to 1.0 pm, preferably 0.4 to 0.6 Vm, the improved method comprising a conducting blood in a forward direction into and through the fibers while maintaining a mean positive transmembrane pressure difference across the membranes from inlets to outlets of the hollow fibers b conducting blood in an external circuit from a region near the outlets of the fibers to a region near the inlets of the fibers or, alternatively, from a region near the inlets of the fibers to a region near the outlets of the fibers c collecting plasma depleted blood from the outlets of the hollow fibers and d collecting plasma which has passed through the pores of the membranes, the effective length of the hollow fibers being such that the L D ratio is no greater than 16,400 cm l D L andD being in centimeters and the velocity of the blood in step a being such that the shear rate is 200 to 2500 sec l preferably 2400 to 2500 sec l The pulsed flow mode of the invention can be described as an improved method for plasmapheresis carried out in a system with a plurality of blood wettable porous membrane hollow fibers having open inlet ends and open outlet ends, each fiber having a lumen diameter D of no greater than 0.050 cm, preferablyD.015 to 0.050 cm, the pore size of the porous membrane being within the range 0.1 to 1.0 urn preferred membranes have pores which are of substantially uniform size within the range 0.4 to 0.6 urn , the improvement characterized in that the plasmapheresis can he carried out continuously, the improved method comprising a conducting blood in a forward direction into and through the fibers while maintaining a mean positive transmembrane pressure difference across the membranes from inlets to outlets of the hollow fibers b terminating the forward conducting of blood c conducting blood through the hollow fibers in the reverse direction, d collecting plasma depleted blood from the outlets of the hollow fibers e collecting plasma which has passed through the pores of the membranes and f repeating in sequence steps a , b and c to collect additional plasma depleted blood and plasma, the effective length of the hollow fibers being such that the L D ratio is no greater than 16,400 cm l D L and D being in centimeters and the velocity of the blood in steps a and c , except at the beginning and end of each step, being such that the shear rate is 200 to 2500 sec 1, preferably 1000 to 1200 sec 1. In the pulsed flow method, the volume of blood conducted in either of step a or step c is at least 5 of the total volume of blood in the system. Further regarding this mode of the invention, it is to be understood that the transmembrane pressure difference across the membranes is negative for part of the distance that the blood is conducted across the membranes.In carrying out the pulsed flow mode, the arithmetic product of a the time average of the transmembrane pressure while it is positive in a portion of the fiber and b the time in that portion of the fiber is greater than such product when the transmembrane pressure is negative. llustrate the pr and module of the invention. The module used in each example, unless otherwise noted, comprised blood wettable polypropylene fibers prepared by known procedures and commercially available having a 330 pm lumen, a 610 um outer diameter, pores which were 0.5 wm in diameter, and a porosity of 70 that is, 70 open areas . The fibers were encased in a tube made of Lucites acrylic resin and potted with a polyurethane resin. The effective length of the fibers, that is, the usable length of the fibers, which is the portion outside the potted regions, is shown in each example. Steady State Flow Examples 1 4 Example 1 The module used in this example had 90 fibers, an effective length of 6.35 cm and an L D of 192 Two units of anticoagulated whole blood were combined, adjusted to an hematocrit hct. of 38 with saline and conducted through the module by a peristaltic pump. Conditions and results are reported inTable 1 wherein Qpc is the rate of exit plasma depleted blood and Op is the rate of exit plasma, both in g minute. After about 60 minutes the plasma depleted blood outlet pressure suddenly dropped to zero. The cause was a block in the module inlet caused by an aggregation which is believed to have been the result of the incompatibility of the two units of blood.The results, however, are consistent with results of other experiments reported herein and, therefore, it is believed that the incompatibility did not materially detract from the value of the experiment as a demonstration of the invention.

It had 2520 fibers of the same kind used in Examples 1 to 11, an effective length of 24 cm and an L D of 728. Two units of anticoagulated whole blood were combined, adjusted to an hct. of 37 , and conducted through the module by a peristaltic pump.Exit plasma depleted blood and plasma which were collected during the procedure were admixed and returned through the module four times so that the length of the experiment could be extended to ensure steady state conditions. Because the results throughout the run were consistent, it was concluded, as in Examples 8 and 9, that the use of recombined blood did not materially affect the results of this experiment. Conditions and results are reported in Table 12.

In order to better compare these results with results attained using the modules of the invention, the results of Examples 1, 2 and 3 were normalized to the conditions of this experiment by use of a regression equation derived from the above test data. These calculated results are tabulated in Table 13 to show the predicted outlet hct and plasma flux using the modules of the invention at the conditions existing at the time intervals reported in this experiment.

Using regression analysis to evaluate other plasmapheresis data obtained by means of the instant invention not included in this specification , Table 14 was assembled to show the expected performance of the hollow fiber module of the invention under steady flow conditions D.S. number of 1 and under conditions of reciprocatory pulsatile flow D.S. numbers of 3 to 9 .Pulsed flow D.S. number Duggins Shaposka number has been defined in Example 5. Table 14 thus shows the predicted outlet hct and plasma flux at various length to diameter L D ratios at various effective fiber lengths at various D.S. numbers. All units from which the data were collected were comprised of blood wettable polypropylene fibers of 330 vm lumen diameter, 610 pm outer diameter and pores of 0.5 Vm diameter.The through put was 0.036 mt minute fiber at an inlet pressure of 75 mm of Hg. The inlet hct of the blood was 38 . It may be seen from Table 14 that when the L D ratio exceeded about 540, the outlet hematocrit and plasma flux values decreased to less acceptable levels.

For example, although the process of the invention can be carried out in such a way that a 90 hematocrit can be obtained in the plasma depleted blood, the goal hematocrit usually is no greater than 70 preferably, it is about 65 . As the goal hematocrit is lowered, the achievable flux is increased. Thus, although higher fluxes are achievable by means of the process of this invention, a flux of about 0.04 mL minute cm2 represents a desirable compromise since, at this value an hematocrit of 65 is readily achievable.Such an achievable combination of flux and hematocrit represents a marked advance over art plasmapheresis processes and apparatus, particularly continuous plamapheresis and apparatus. In addition to the aforesaid correlation between pulsatility, L D ratio, hematocrit and flux, one skilled in the art will also recognize that these parameters are dependent on the flow rate of the whole blood flowing through the system. Finally, it is to be understood that all of the examples and the single experiment described herein, except for Examples 7 to 9, were carried out with whole blood adjusted to an hct of 37 385, and that different results hct and flux would be obtained at different hematocrit starting levels. In general, when a plasmapheresis is carried out in the art, male blood which has a normal hematocrit of about 44 45 is diluted with anticoagulant to an hematocrit of about 38 female blood which has a normal hematocrit of about 38 is diluted with anticoagulant to about 30 . The following discussion is intended to supplement the aforesaid disclosure in that it outlines steps which one skilled in the art may follow in carrying out a plasmapheresis by means of the invention.In addition to definitions already provided, the following may be useful 1 Recycle D.S number Qwb recycle Owb Qwb the flow rate of whole blood Qrecycle the flow rate of recycle 2 N the number of fibers in the module 3 The active surface area of the fibers A rrDNL wherein D and L are in cm 4 Shear rate sec l 4 flow velocity in cm sec lumen radius in cmSteady State Flow 1.
