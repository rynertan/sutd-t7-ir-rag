# Semiconductor device having a protection circuit.

## Abstract
The protection circuit for inner elements such as metal insulator semiconductor MIS field effect transistors in a semiconductor device of high packing density has been improved. The protection circuit comprises protective ele ments 14, 15 of two types. The one 14 , has a deep dif fusion region 38 providing the element with high surge capacity an ability to withstand the incoming surge energy and another one has a shallow diffusion region 45, 46 providing a low breakdown voltage. With the combination of these protective elements of two types, the protection circuit can withstand the high input surge energy and, at the same time, it provides a low protection voltage suitable to protect the inner elements from breakdown.
