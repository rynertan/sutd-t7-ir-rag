## Description
METHOD TO DELAY GELATION OF POLYMERS, CONTROLLEDGELATION COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING SAID POLYMERS, ANDPARTICULAR APPLICATION TO THE TREATEMENT OF OIL WELLS The present invention is related to the field of gelled polymers, and of compositions to obtain such polymers, to be injected into oil wells. When procuding hydrocarbons from a subterranean hydrocarbon bearing formation it is often desirable to reduce the permeability of preselected zones of the formation. In general this is necessary either because these zones consume too high a quantity of fluid, as for example thief zones during drilling or cementing operations, or zones taking in most of the injected fluid in the case of assisted recovery , or because these zones produce too much unwanted fluid, water for example. One technique permitting the reduction of the permeability of selected zones is the use of gelled polymer solutions. One of the problems often encountered in utilising gelable solutions of polymeric material in porous medium is the placement of the very highly viscous gel within the porous structure. Difficulties are encountered both in pumping such a gel because of the high friction forces and in introducing it into the porous matrix because of the high pressure which develops and of the possible irreversible degradation due to shearing stresses . One possible solution is to delay the onset of gelation of the polymer solution such that it enters the formation rock as a very thin fluid insensitive to shearing stresses and once placed in the desirable zone forms a gel in situ. To obtain a polymeric gel in aqueous solution it is necessary to have the polymer hydrated, i.e. extension of the polymer chains by interaction with water in the presence of a system capable of releasing a crosslinking agent. The crosslinking agent then bonds adjacent macromolecules together to build a three dimensional network resulting in a very highly viscous gel. The crosslinking reaction in which we are interested involves the production of multivalent metallic ions from precursors by reaction with suitable activators. A typical precursor might be sodium dichromate which can react with a suitable activator e.g. sodium dithionite to produce trivalent chromium ions. These trivalent chromium ions are capable of inter acting with, for example polymer carboxylic groups linking adjacent macromolecules together and are thus crosslinking agents. The polymers which are sensitive to such a reaction are those capable of interacting with the crosslinking agent to form a polymeric gel. These include polymers containing anionic groups within their structure, particularly carboxylic acid groups or salts of said acid groups , for example acrylic polymers, carboxy cellulose derivatives, and other polysaccharides, Xanthan gum, etc. Such crosslinking reactions involving anionic polymers and a precursor activator crosslinking system are well known and delays in the gelation process have been obtained previously in two different ways. First, it has been found that certain activators will react more slowly with a given precursor under certain reaction conditions than others. For example, at low temperatures and high pH s the production of crosslinking trivalent chromium ions from dichromate ions will occur much more rapidly when using sodium dithionite as activator than, for example, when using sodium thiosulfate as activator. A second method of delaying gelation with this type of system consists of including in the solution substances capable of interacting with the trivalent crosslinking ions. In this manner, a competition is set up between the interaction of the crosslinking agent with the polymer groups leading to gel formation and the interaction of the crosslinking groups with the added substance this creating a delay in the gelation . U.S. patent no. 3,926,258, for example, uses a polymer crosslinking agent mixture of the above type, in the presence of complexing agents such as citric acid and obtains delays in gelation of up to one hour. United States Patent 3 926 258 describes a method of obtaining the delayed gelation of carboxy polymers using a dichromate as preferred precursor and a bisulfite as preferred activator in the presence of citric acid as preferred complexing agent. Delays of up to one hour are thus reached according to said document, when using the complexing agent and crosslinking agent in approximately 1 1 ratio 0.013 M citric acid 0.0096 M Cr3 ions . No mention is made in said document of using polyphosphonic acids or their salts as complexing agents nor of thiourea or thiones mentioned hereinafter as preferred reducing agent. The delay obtained with the aforesaid method is extremely short up o one hour whereas according to the invention, as will be seen hereinafter, a delay of several weeks or more can be reached. It will also be noted hereinafter that the ratio of polyphosphonate chromium III in the system according to the invention is much less than 1.1 1 40 and of a much lower concentration 10 4 M polyphosphonate 0.004 M Cr3 . Said ratio obviously varies in relation to a number of parameters, including the required delay in gelation. For example, to increase the delay in gelation, the ratio in question can be brought down to 1 30. It will not be necessary to dwell on this particular point in the present application. However, the example of 1 40 ratio of polyphosphonate chromium III according to the invention suggests that a mechanism other than a sequestering mechanism is operative. Normally, a ratio of 1 1 such as described in the aforesaid patent is the minimum for complexation and it is often necessary to add a greater amount of complexing agent than there are metallic ions. Furthermore, US patent 3,926,258 makes no reference whatsoever to the temperature at which the gelation reaction occurs and it must be assumed that ambient temperatures prevailed. The system according to this invention on the contrary, is specifically designed to operate at high temperatures although it may be modified for use at lower temperatures. It will also be noted that the aforesaid patent makes no mention of the pH, whereas according to the invention, this is an essential parameter. U.S. patents 3,899,293 and 3,971,734 describe a method of stabilizing sulfite or bisulfite solutions in contact with the atmosphere by slowing down their reaction with oxygen. This is done by using polyphosphonate additives. Sulfites and bisulfites are reducing agents and react with atmosphere oxygen in a reduction reaction.The mechanism corresponding to this reaction is not comparable to the mechanism implied in the present invention. The present invention relates to a new class of agents capable of delaying gelation of appropriate polymers by metallic ions. These new agents or inhibitors are selected, according to the invention, from any compound capable of inhibiting the reaction between the selected precursor of crosslinking agent see hereafter and the reducing agent activator, see hereafter , thus delaying the overall gelation reaction. It has been found according to the invention that this perfectly novel delaying method in the prior art, and in particular in U.S. patent 3 926 258, it is on the contrary the reaction of the crosslinking agent with the polymer which is inhibited could be performed with compounds which can be defined, very generally, as being part of the conventional chelating agents, such as for example, amino poly carboxylic acids, hydroxy polycarboxylic acids, poly phosphonic acids, and salts thereof. The following compounds are cited by way of example and non restrictively ethylenediaminetetramethylenephosphonic acid l hydroxyethylidene l,l diphosphonic acid poly phosphonate 3 aminotrimethylenephosphonic acid polyphosphonate 1 . diethylenetriaminepentamethylenephosphonic acid poly phosphonate 2 . Alkali metal and ammonium salts of these acids . E.D.T.A. ethylenediaminetetracetic acid and alkali metal and ammonium salts thereof diethylenetriaminepentacetic acid and alkali metal and ammonium salts thereof .N hydroxyethylene diaminetriacetic acid and alkali metal and ammonium salts thereof . citric acid . NTA nitrilotriacetic acid. Polyphosphonates are especially preferred in the case of the invention and are preferably used at concentrations of 5 ppm to 5000 ppm. Nothing could really indicate that these agents could play a really efficient part as gelation delaying agents. According to the invention, their operating mechanism is indeed different, as explained hereinabove, from a sequestering mechanism, for example . The applicant has discovered that these additives are capable of delaying gelation of hydrolysed polyacrylamides especially in the presence of dichromates and other precursors. Suitable precursors of crosslinking agents according to the invention will be all compounds with high oxidation level and capable of producing crosslinking agents or species by reaction with a suitable reducing agent activating agent . Amongst these compounds alkali metal or ammonium chromate alkali metal or ammonium dichromates, sodium dichromate being particularly preferred for economical reasons. Suitable reducing agents or activators can be any substance capable of reacting with a suitable precursor to produce crosslinking species or agents whose reactions can be inhibited by at least one of the inhibitors discovered according to the invention and described hereinabove. Such reducing agents are preferably slowly reacting weak reducing agents and include for example sulfites, phosphites, thiosulfates, thiocyanates, and organic thiones and thiols. The concentration of the reducing agent is selected so as to meet the requirements of gelation time and the appropriate reduction of the precursor.Preferably, concentration of the reducing agent can vary between 50 ppm and 15,000 ppm. Suitable systems according to the invention include thiourea and its alkyl derivatives. A gel forms when the reducing agent reacts with the precursor, this producing crosslinking agents which in turn react with the preionised polymer groups to form a very viscous gel. It is possible, according to the invention, to introduce a delay in gelation by adding at least one inhibitor such as described hereinabove. It should be noted on this point that the inhibitor reducing agent couple is quite specific. Indeed, it is possible for an inhibitor of a certain reduction reaction not to inhibit another reduction reaction. The concentration field of the inhibitor is also of crucial importance above a certain value, there is simply no gelation. Thus, a precise and predetermined gelation time will only be obtained if the above couple and the concentrations are correctly selected. A man skilled in the art will know how to choose, from his own knowledge and from the indications contained in the present application, and if necessary by conducting a few known tests, those components which are best adapted of the inhibitor reducing agent couple, as well as the concentrations which will lead to the required gelation time. Polymers to which the invention is applicable include all the macromolecular species which can be crosslinked by multivalent metallic ions, in particular anionic polymers. These include carboxylic groups containing polymers in free acid or acid salt form polymers capable of forming carboxylic groups on dissolving polymers containing sulfate anionic groups polymers containing cis hydroxy groups. The following polymers are cited by way of example and non restrictively polyacrylates partially hydrolysed polyacrylamides xanthan gum carboxy polysaccharides, for example carboxymethylcellulose CMC , carboxymethylhydroxyethylcellulose CMHEC and carboxymethyl guar gum alginates poly methyl and oxide vinyl maleic anhydride cis hydroxy group containing polymers, for example polyvinylic alcohols and galactomannoses for example guar gum, locust , bean gum , etc sulfate group containing polymers, for example carragheenanes. These polymers further include, for example, synthetic terpolymers containing acrylic monomer moieties and sulfonic groups. As indicated hereinabove, the agents according to the invention are capable of delaying the gelation of polymers containing for example carboxylic groups. Another absolutely essential characteristic which has never been obtained in the prior art, resides in the possibility to control the gelation time, accurately. This characteristic is of primary importance in that, when treating underground reservoirs, it is necessary not only to delay the gelation of polymer solutions, but also to obtain a precise control of the gelation time of these solutions. This is necessary in order to prevent both the formation of gel in the drilling well or in the pumping equipment on the surface with the cleaning problems that this entails if gelation occurs too rapidly, and having to stop for long periods the treatment of the wells if gelation occurs too late.Ideally, gelation should occur immediately after the injection of the entire solution of polymer fluid into the layer to be treated. Despite the wellknown advantage of this characteristic, this could never be achieved in the prior art owing to the fact it was impossible to control the gelation time. For the very first time, the systems according to the invention have afforded the possibility to control effectively, i.e. accurately, the gelation time, owing to a very simple parameter which is the pH. For most petroleum applications, the gels are required to have four essential properties, which are 1 to be usable at high temperature 2 to be compatible with the wide range of brines normally found on the oilfield 3 to have good thermal stability 4 to have a gelation time which is accurately controllable. The fourth condition raises a number of problems due to the fact that a many of the reactions between reducing agents and precursors are acid catalysed and hence very sensitive to small variations in pH b it is difficult to obtain an accurate equilibrium pH of a polymer solution in anything but strictly controlled laboratory conditions. For the system to be useful on the oilfield and to have a predictable gel time, it is therefore necessary to have pH control through a buffer system, compatible with the other components. There are no general limitations for choosing the buffer systems since these systems are only used to control the pH of the medium. However, for a given chemical system, namely polymer, precursor, reducing agent, etc., selected so as to lead depending also on the conditions of the temperature, water or brine used to the required delay in gelation, the choice of the buffer system may be limited by the required pH and by the compatibility of the buffer components with the components of the chemical system. Simple tests will enable any one skilled in the art to determine the best system for every particular case. For example, a citric acid sodium citrate buffer or an NH4 chloride buffer, or a phosphate buffer, are not suitable for the contemplated application, because of the secondary reactions such as precipitations, complexations, etc. Tests have shown that a sodium acetate acetic acid buffer is more suitable according to the invention. The present invention therefore relates preferably to systems with the following componentsPolymer partially hydrolysed polyacrylamidesBuffer sodium acetate acetic acidPrecursor sodium dichromateReducing agent activator thiourea and its N,N dialkyl derivativesInhibitors polyphosphonic acids and their salts. The invention enables, at a given temperature, to accurately control the delay in gelation for a polymer solution, by modifying the concentration of the polyphosphonate, or the pH, or the concentration of the reactants. the invention can be carried out over a very wide range of temperature, with fresh water, brines or sea water, to obtain delays in gelation which can vary between a few hours to a few weeks, the gelation time being also conrolled accurately. The method according to the invention can be carried out at a temperature varying between the freezing point of the solution and the polymer decomposition temperature, more normally between 590 F and 2210 F. It will be noted that there is a minimum polymer concentration below which gelation does not occur. This is due to the fact that, in order to be crosslinked and to start gelling, the polymer chains concentration must be such that said chains can cover one another. The minimum concentration depends on the type of polymer, on its molecular weight and on the composition of the brine used as solvent. There is no special maximum concentration other than the limit beyond which a phase separation saturation phenomenon occurs. In general, a higher polymer concentration of the solution, will mean that the initial solution will be more viscous and that the final gel will be more consistant. By way of example, it can be indicated that preferred polymer concentrations are advantageously between about 250 ppm and 25,000 ppm. The buffer system concentration is not limited in any particular way. The concentration will be selected to allow suitable pH control of the system. Concentrations in precursor reducing agent inhibitor these three components control the reaction speed. The lower the precursor and reducing agent concentration is, the slower the reaction.However, below a certain concentration limit for either, no consistant gels can form because the quantity of crosslinking agents which forms becomes too small. On the other hand, there is a possibility of reaction between these two components when the viscosity of the solution is increased, whatever their concentration. However, in certain applications, gels of low consistency may be preferable. Such gels also form part of the invention. Thus, the concentrations of precursors and reducing agents will be chosen for each individual case, in order to obtain the required gelation time and gel consistency characteristics.When the precursor is sodium dichromate, it is particularly advantageous to use it in concentrations varying between 50 and 5,000 ppm. Also, the higher the inhibitor concentration is, the greater the delay in gelation.There is however a maximum concentration limit beyond which no gelation is observed. This concentration threshold is very low, which is surprising. For example, for a system including partially hydrolysed polyacrylamide 3,000 ppm thiourea 1,500 ppm sodium dichromate 500 ppm pH 5.3 T 158 F the maximum inhibitor concentration is 300 ppm when the inhibiting agent is polyphosphonate agent 1. The following examples are given unrestrictedly to illustrate the invention. In these examples, the gelation time Gt is defined as the time necessary for the viscosity of the solution to go above 2,000 cP 100 reading units , using a BROOKFIELD viscometer LV1 spindle, 3 tr min. . EXAMPLE 1. The effect of a polyphosphonate inhibitor on the gelation time of polyacrylamides in the presence of a reducing agent and of sodium dichromate, has been studied. The system used was 3,000 ppm of partially hydrolysed polyacrylamide in a oonventional brine at 3.0 NaCl 1,500 ppm of reducing agent 500 ppm of sodium dichromate buffer solution of pH 5.3 temperature 1670 F with or without 100 ppm of polyphosphonate 1.
