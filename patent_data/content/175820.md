# Making high strength semi crystalline ceramic material.

## Abstract
A composition and method of making a high strength semi crystalline ceramic material of the lithium, aluminum, silicate oxides system type. The composition is characterized by a relatively narrow range of lithium, aluminum, silicate and potassium oxides to form a base glass batch and is modified by including a novel proportional combination of the catalysts or modifiers comprising the components TiO₂, ZrO₂ and SnO₂ and including one or more additives taken from a group consisting of B₂O₃, MgO, Cr₂O₃, CeO₂, V₂O₅ and Na₂O within specific percentage ranges. The composition is formed and subjected to heat treat ment within certain time and temperature steps to provide for the desired degree, size and type of crystalline formation which exhibits the desired physical, mechanical and chemic al properties which include a superior resistance to high speed projectiles for armour applications.
