# A fastening device.

## Abstract
A vibration resistant fastening device includes a fastener 1 comprising a shank 20 and a drivable head 21 , the shank 20 having a first handed thread closer to the head 21 and an opposite handed thread further from the head 21 . A nut 2 is threadably engaged upon the first handed thread and annular washers 3 4 carrying first and second interengageable cam faces are diposed around the shank 20 . In use the opposite handed threaded portion of the shank 20 is threadably engaged in a receiving member 25 and the washer cam faces 5 as clamped together between the nut 2 and the receiving member 25 . The first annular washer 3 is fixed to the nut 2 and the second annular washer 4 is fixed to the receiving member 25, via an intermediate member 26 , and the cam faces 5 co operate to increase the tensile stress in shank 20 when the nut 2 is turned in the loosening direction under the influence of vibration.
