# INTEGRATED CIRCUIT HAVING FREQUENCY DIVIDER CIRCUIT ADAPTABLE FOR HIGH SPEED TESTING.

## Abstract
An integrated circuit having a frequency divider circuit adaptable for high speed testing. The frequency divider cir cuit is split into two stages of a pre stage frequency divider circuit 12 and a post stage frequency divider circuit 14 . An output buffer circuit 3 and a testing signal input circuit 4 are connected in parallel to an alarm terminal 7 . The testing signal applied to the alarm terminal 7 is fed to the post stage frequency divider circuit 14 through the testing signal input circuit 4 and a switching circuit 13 .
