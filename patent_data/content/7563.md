# A pile yarn, a cut pile carpet made from this yarn, and a method of producing the yarn.

## Abstract
A pile yarn for a carpet and a cut pile carpet. A bulky yarn of a polyamide multifilament is fed to a false twisting and heat setting device where filaments in the yarn are thermally and partially adhered to each other while the yarn is false twisted. A bulky cohesive continuous multifilament yarn thus obtained has alternate twists therein along the lengthwise direction thereof and a latent torque therein, and after it is tufted on a substrate 12 of a carpet as a pile yarn and after the piles are cut, the carpet is heat treated, preferably by means of saturated or superheated steam. The torque in the cut piles 11 is developed to create true twists.
