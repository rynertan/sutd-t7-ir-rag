# METHOD OF MAKING POLYIMIDE FOAMS

## Abstract
A method of making a resilient, flame resistant, non friable polyimide foam comprises a mixing at least one aromatic dianhydride with an alcohol and heating the resulting mixture to form a half ester, b mixing a diamine component comprising at least one aliphatic diamine and at least one aromatic diamine with the product from step a , c drying the resulting mixture, and d heating the resulting solid to give a polyimide foam.
