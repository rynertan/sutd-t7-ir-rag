# Protective relay with second harmonic suppression.

## Abstract
A relay adapted for protection of a transformer and capable of functioning with certainty upon occurrence of any internal fault in the transformer but not functioning in the case of an inrush current which flows therein at the time of non load energization or the like. The relay comprises a ratio element for comparing the amount of a suppression current with that of a differential current flowing in the transformer, an element for detecting the content proportion of a second harmonic component in the differential current, a monost able multivibrator for sending an output of a fixed pulse width at the moment of detection of the differential current, an AND circuit for producing an output in accordance with the logical product condition relative to the output of the second harmonic detection element and that of the monost able multivibrator, a timing circuit for producing an output when the output of the second harmonic detection element continues for a predetermined period of time, and gate means for suppressing the output of the ratio differential element when either the output of the AND circuit or that of the timing circuit is being fed thereto.
