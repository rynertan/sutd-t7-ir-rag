# DC DC converter comprising a PWM inverter producing a quasi trapezoidal waveform, and a low losses rectifier to produce a DC output.

## Abstract
Alternating current pulse width modulated inverter converter having quasi trapezoidal waveform, capable of high frequency 10 DIVIDED 30 kHz inverter a.c. output rectifying diodes low loss energy transfer from primary source to d.c. output lines. Due to its characteristics, it may be adopted for space as well as ground applications. Its uniqueness is given by the insertion within its converting circuit of a peculiar magnetic generator through which energy with square wave current and controlled aneptitude and duration, is transferred from the primary source to the inverter. This magnetic generator exploits the presence of paramite capacities of the inverter transformer or that of any other capacitive circuit suitably inserted, to achieve at a quasi trapezoidal a.c. voltage at the inverter output.
