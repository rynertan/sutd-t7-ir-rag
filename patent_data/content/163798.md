# Contour forming conical shapes.

## Abstract
A truncated conical segment is made by the steps of contour rolling two pieces of metal, then longitudinally weld ing them, followed by contour rolling the weldment to preferentially reduce one of the pieces of the weldment more than the other. This provides a skewed trapezoid shape which is then 3 roll formed into a ring having a conical shape. The angle of the cone is a function of the preferential reduction in the second contour rolling step.
