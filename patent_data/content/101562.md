# Combined haemophilus influenzae and diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus vaccine.

## Abstract
A vaccine for eliciting polyribosyl ribitol phosphate PRP antibody formation in a warm blooded animal has been invented. The vaccine comprises the capsular polysaccharide PRP isolated and purified from Haemophilus influenzae type b combined with a diphtheria, Bordetella pertussis and tetanus DPT vaccine. A method of making a vaccine for eliciting polyribosylribitol phosphate PRP antibody formation in a warm blooded animal has also been invented. The method of making comprises obtaining purified PRP dissolving the PRP in phosphate buffered saline solution having a pH of about 7.0 sterile filtering the PRP solution and combining the PRP solution with a diphtheria, B. pertussis and tetanus vaccine. Finally, a method for inducing active immunization in a warm blooded animal against systemic infection caused by the pathogen H. influenzae type b has been invented. The method of using comprises administering an immunogenic amount of a vaccine comprising the capsular polysaccharide polyribosyl ribitol phosphate PRP isolated and purified from H. influenzae type b combined with a diphtheria, B. pertussis and tetanus DPT vaccine.
