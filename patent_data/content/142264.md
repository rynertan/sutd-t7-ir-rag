# Hydraulic systems for ink jet printers.

## Abstract
A hydraulic system, suitably an ink supply system for an ink jet printer, wherein a first pump 27 conveys ink under pressure from a reservoir 1 to a work head 3 and a gear pump 29 returns unused liquid from a collector 19 at the work head to the reservoir. A bleed line 49 connects an outlet from the first pump to an inlet to the gear pump. Accordingly, there is a flow of liquid via the bleed line such that the gear pump applies sufficient suction to the collector to draw air or a mixture of air and unused liquid therefrom. The flow is also sufficient to ensure adequate lubrication of the gear pump 29 . The first pump 27 may also be a gear pump, in which case the two pumps are formed as a double ended pump.
