## Abstract
A film package containing a stack of films provided with a clamp notch at a side edge in a flexible lighttight envelope is held vertically in a lighttight loading chamber. The films are held by a clamp engaging with the notch from outside the film package. The lower end of the envelope is then cut, and the clamp is released from the notch to make the films fall from the envelope. Then, a shutter is closed between the envelope and the films for shielding the films from light.
