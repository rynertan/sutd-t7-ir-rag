# Apparatus for controlling merging of data parts into a cache unit.

## Abstract
A register unit includes means for storing pertinent data relative to a plurality to cache transactions, identifying the zones of an addressed word block which is the subject of the individual transactions. These data are selectively extracted from the register to control the merging of the identified zone or zones of the associated word with the remainder of the data in the addressed word block.
