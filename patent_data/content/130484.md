# INVERTER APPARATUS

## Abstract
This invention relates to an inverter comprising a fre quency converter 2 for converting DC power to AC power, an oscillation control circuit 19 for stepwise generating a com mand value concerning the conversion condition of the fre quency converter, and operation control means 13, 14 which, when the command value from the oscillation control circuit changes, controls the oscillation control circuit 19 to repeti tively generate a plurality of times alternate new and old com mand values before and after change of command value. Par ticularly, this invention is to provide an inverter capable of con tinuing smooth operation even when the control system has a limited resolution.
