## Description
This invention relates to connectors for bringing fiber optic light conductors into a confronting relationship. The connectors may be used, for example, in an oximeter. Fiber optics are used in catheters and probes for the purpose of transmitting light into and receiving light from internal regions of the body. Because a catheter or probe must be sized to be received within a vein or artery, the fiber optics used within such an apparatus must also be of very small diameter. For example, a catheter or probe may include an elongated tube having proximal and distal openings and fiber optic means in the form of one or more fiber optic light conductors in the passage and extending through the proximal opening to provide a proximal section of the fiber optic means outside of the tube. The fiber optic means is coupled to a connector body, and the connector body is received within a cavity of a receptacle which optically couples the catheters to an instrument. The instrument may, for example, provide a source of light for transmission through the catheter and the necessary equipment to process a light signal received from the catheter. One problem with this construction is the mounting of the fine fiber optic light conductors, on the connector body. The fiber optic light conductors, each of which comprises one or more optical fibers, must be located with respect to the connector body with great precision and securely retained in position. This is necessary so that light can be transmitted efficiently between the instrument and the catheter. Locating the fiber optic light conductor on the connector body with precision is difficult because of the small diameter of the optical fibers. It is also important to assure that the connector body is tightly seated within the receptacle. If this is not done, losses will occur at the interface. Moreover, the connector body and receptacle must cooperate with each other to precisely position the connector body within the receptacle to maximize the optical coupling between the connector body and the receptacle. A prior art connecting apparatus is known from FR A 2, 371, 696. This apparatus includes guide means which guide a connector in one direction only. Other connecting apparatus is know from GB A 2, 041, 559 US A 4, 026, 633 US A 4, 477, 149, US A 4,140, 367 and EP A 78, 547. According to the invention there is provided an apparatus comprising The multi direction guide path which guides first in one direction there a second direction has the advantage of orienting accurately the optical portions of the connector body and the receptacle. With apparatus embodying the invention, the optical portions of the connector body are guided accurately into confronting relationship or registration with the optical portions of the receptacle. The connector body and receptacle cooperate to pull the connector body into the receptacle to place these optical portions into substantial engagement with with each other. In a preferred embodiment the connector body snaps into the receptacle with an audible click so that the operator is made aware that the connector body is fully and correctly seated in the receptacle so that false locking is not likely to occur. The invention is applicable to an apparatus comprising a connector body having an exterior face and a fiber optic light conductor mounted on the connector body with an end of the fiber optic light conductor being adjacent the face and capable of transmitting light to or from a location on the face. A receptacle is used to optically couple the fiber optic light conductor to an instrument. The receptacle has a cavity for receiving the connector body, a face partly defining the cavity and means for transmitting light to or from a location on the face of a receptacle. The connector body is inserted into the cavity of the receptacle. With apparatus embodying this invention, the receptacle cooperates with the connector body to urge the connector body further into the cavity to place the above mentioned locations on the faces in substantial engagement. This is accomplished by providing a cam surface on the connector body and biasing means on the receptacle for cooperating with the cam surface to provide the driving force. With this construction, the biasing means acts on the cam surface, when the above mentioned locations are nearly in engagement to drive the connector body completely into the cavity to place such locations in substantial engagement. The cam surface and the biasing means may also retain the connector body in the cavity of the receptacle. Preferably, the connector body has a groove on its exterior surface, and the groove is partly defined by the cam surface, In this event, the biasing means may include a projection on the receptacle which is receivable in the groove. In a preferred embodiment, the biasing means includes spaced regions of the receptacle on opposite sides of the cavity, and the receptacle is sufficiently resilient to allow the spaced regions to be resiliently spread further apart. The above described cooperation of the biasing means and the cam surface urges the container body in the second direction. The cam follower surface is accurately positioned in relation to the end of the fiber optic light conductor without any accumulation of tolerances, and this helps assure accurate orientation of the optical portions and so accentuate the advantage of the invention over the prior act. The apparatus embodying the invention may be particularly adapted for use in a catheter or probe which includes an elongated tube sized to be received within a vein or an artery and having a passage with proximal and distal openings. In this event, the fiber optic light conductor is partially in the passage and extends through the proximal opening to provide a proximal section outside of the tube which is coupled to the connector body. More than one fiber optic light conductor may be provided and each conductor may include one or more optical fibers. One of the exit passages in the connector body is provided for each of the finer optic light conductors. A preferred embodiment of the invention will now be described by way of example and with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 shows a catheter 11 which can be releasably coupled to an instrument 13 using a connector body 15 and a receptacle 17. The receptacle 17 may be considered as part of the instrument 13. Although the features of this invention are particularly adapted for use with a catheter, the invention is not limited to use with a catheter, and the particular catheter shown is purely illustrative. The catheter 11 includes a tube 19 sized to be received within a vein or an artery of a patient and having proximal and distal ends and a plurality of lumens or passages, including passages 21 and 23 extending longitudinally through it. The passage 21 has a distal opening 25 Fig. 1a and a proximal opening 27 Fig. 1 . A balloon 29 is provided on the tube 19 adjacent the distal tip of the catheter. The catheter 11 also includes fiber optic means 31 extending completely through the passage 21 of the tube 19 from the distal opening 25 through the proximal opening 27 to provide a proximal section 33 of the fiber optic means outside of the tube. Of course, other tubing in communication with the other passages of the tube 19 can also exit at the proximal opening 27. Although various constructions are possible, in the embodiment illustrated, the fiber optic means 31 includes fiber optic light conductors 35 and 37 for conducting light to the distal opening 25 and for conducting a light signal away from the distal opening 25, respectively. The distal ends of the light conductors are tightly retained within the passage 21, which is of larger cross section than the two light conductors, by a spacer 32 Fig. 1a . A catheter of this type can be used to measure the oxygen saturation of blood by determining its color absorption characteristics in accordance with known techniques. To make this determination, the catheter 11 is inserted into the heart of the patient to place the distal opening 25 in the pulmonary artery. The proximal section 33 of the fiber optic means 31 is coupled to the connector body 15, and the details of the connector body are shown in Figs. 2 8a. The connector body 15 has wall means which define an enclosure, and the wall means includes a circumscribing peripheral wall 39, a floor 41 and a cover 43 Fig. 4 . Supporting feet 44 Figs. 3 and 3a extend downwardly from the floor 41. The peripheral wall 39 includes opposed side walls 45 an end wall or face 47 and an end wall 49. The peripheral wall 39 extends perpendicular to the floor 41 and has a ledge 51 and a lip 53 projecting from the ledge. The cover 43 is receivable within the lip 53 and onto the ledge 51 with a snap fit to releasably retain the cover in position. The face 47 includes identical face sections 55 Figs. 2 and 4 separated by a tapered gap 57 which narrows as it extends inwardly of the enclosure and which is defined by a channel section 59. The face 47 also has inclined corner sections 61 which join the sections 55 to the side walls 45, respectively. The face sections 55 have identical recesses 63, respectively, which open into the gap 57 Figs. 3, 3a and 4 . The face sections 55 are flat and coplanar, except for the recesses 63. Each of the recesses 63 is partially defined by an inclined cam follower surface 65. The other side surfaces of each of the recesses 63 are also inclined and they terminate inwardly in a flat bottom surface. Each of the side walls 45 has a recess or groove 67 in its exterior surface, and each of the grooves has a longitudinal axis which extends perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the associated side wall. Each of the grooves 67 is identical and is partially defined by a inclined cam surface 69 along the forward or leading side of the groove. The cam surfaces 69 are used as described more fully hereinbelow for connecting the connector body 15 to the receptacle 17. The connector body 15 can be of two piece, molded plastic construction as shown in Fig. 4. The cover 43 is configured to mate with and close the opening at the upper end of the construction formed by the peripheral wall 39 and the floor 41. The floor 41 may have a central aperture 71. The end wall 49 has an entrance passage 73, and each of the face sections 55 has an identical exit passage 75. Because the exit passages 75 are identical, only one of them is described in detail herein. As shown in Fig. 8, the end wall 49 has a pair of legs 77 which project inwardly into the enclosure and define shoulders 79 on opposite sides of the entrance passage 73. The entrance passage 73 cooperates with the proximal section 33 of the fiber optic means 31 as shown in Fig. 8a. Specifically, the proximal section 33 includes a sheet of shrink tubing 81 and a shorter section of shrink tubing 83 shrunk over and glued to the tubing 81. The tubing 83 forms an annular shoulder 85 which engages the shoulders 79 as shown to provide strain relief. Thus, the proximal section 33 of the fiber optic means 31 passes through the entrance passage 73 and into the interior of the enclosure. As shown in Figs. 2 and 2a, the light conductors 35 and 37 extend beyond the end of a sheath 87 in which they are encased, and an excess length of both of the light conductors is provided within the enclosure. In this embodiment, each of the light conductors 35 and 37 is in the form of a fine, small diameter optical fiber. The light conductors 35 and 37 extend into the exit passages 75, respectively, and they are retained in these exit passages with their ends flush with the outer surface 88 Fig. 6c of the associated face sections 55. To facilitate insertion of the light conductors 35 and 37 into the associated exit passage 75, tapered lead in grooves 89 are provided on the interior surfaces of the face sections 55 as shown in Figs. 4 and 5. Each of the lead in grooves 89 is identical and extends from the ledge 51 to the associated exit passage 75, and it progressively narrows as it extends toward such exit passage. In the embodiment illustrated, each of the lead in grooves 89 tapers linearly, except for a step 91 closely adjacent the exit passage 75. With this construction, the light conductor 37 can be easily inserted into the wide end of the lead in groove 89 adjacent the ledge 51 and guided toward, and into, the exit passage 75. A preferred construction of the exit passage 75 is shown in Figs. 6 and 7. The exit passage 75 has an entrance section 93 of reduced cross section, an exit section 95 of enlarged cross section, a shoulder 97 between these sections, and flat surfaces or surface portions 99 and curved surfaces or surface portions 101 arranged circumferentially in the exit section of the passage. The flat surfaces 99 are set back slightly from the exterior surface 88 of the face section 55 at which the exit passage 75 opens. If desired, a region of the flat surfaces 99 adjacent to the outer surface 88 may be inclined radially inwardly as they extend toward the outer surface 88. The surfaces 99 and 101 are arranged circumferentially in the exit section 95. Although various constructions are possible, in the embodiment illustrated, there are three identical flat surfaces 99 and they are spaced apart 120 degrees. Each of the curved surfaces 101 is identical and comprises a segment of a cylinder. One of the curved surfaces 101 lies circumferentially between adjacent flat surfaces 99. The flat surfaces 99 are closer together radially than the surfaces 101. For example, the flat surfaces 99 may be sized and arranged to receive a member of .0135 inch diameter, and the curved surfaces 101 may be segments of a cylinder having a diameter of .016 inch. To attach the light conductor 37 to the face section 55, the light conductor 37 is inserted into the exit passage 75 using the lead in groove 89 and through the exit passage as shown in Fig. 6a. Accordingly, the light conductor 37 has an end portion 105 on the exit section side of the exit passage 75. Next, the end portion 105 is radially enlarged. Although the radial enlarging of the light conductor 37 can be carried out in different ways, this is preferably accomplished by using a light conductor of the type which radially enlarges in response to being heated. For example, an optical fiber comprising an acrylic core and a fluoropolymer sheath will radially expand and axially contract in response to heating. Preferably, the end portion 105 is heated to radially enlarge the end portion to form an enlargement 107 Fig. 6b of the desired cross sectional area which may be frustoconical with the major diameter at the end of the light conductor. For example, a light conductor having a diameter of .010 inch can be enlarged to a diameter of about .015 inch by exposing the end portion 105 to a temperature of about 550 degrees Fahrenheit and continuing that exposure for about 8 seconds. Next, the enlargement 107 is forced into the exit section 95 of the exit passage 75 to compressively engage the enlargement with the flat surfaces 99 as shown in Figs. 6c, 7a and 7b. Preferably, the enlargement 107 is pushed back into the exit section 95. As shown in Fig. 6c, at the completion of this step, a proximal end 109 of the light conductor 37 is flush with the outer surface 88 and is therefor at a known location on the surface 88. The enlargement 107 is somewhat deformable and its diameter is greater than the diameter than can be accepted by the flat surfaces 99. Accordingly, the forcing of the enlargement 107 between the flat surfaces 99 displaces material from the enlargement 107 circumferentially to regions 111 Fig. 7a between the enlargement 107 and the curved surfaces 101. As shown in Fig. 7a, there are three regions 111, each of which is in the form of a radial gap. Accordingly, the enlargement 107 is frictionally retained in the exit section 95 by the flat surfaces 99 and, in addition, the enlargement 107 at its juncture with the non enlarged portion of the light conductor 37 defines a shoulder which engages the shoulder 97 to inhibit withdrawal of the light conductor through the entrance section 93. Preferably, a suitable adhesive is applied to the enlargement 107 and or to the surfaces of the exit passage 75 prior to forcing the enlargement 107 back into the exit section 95. Accordingly, the frictional retention of the enlargement 107 by the flat surfaces 99 serves, in effect, as a fixture to hold the light conductor 37 within the exit passage 75 while the adhesive cures. Inclining regions of the flat surfaces 99 adjacent the outer surface 88 radially inwardly as they extend toward the surface 88 helps to lock the enlargement 107 in the exit passage 75. The flat surfaces 99 also accurately center the light conductors. The receptacle 17 Figs. 1 3a comprises a body 113 and a cover 115 mounted on the body for slidable moverent longitudinally of the body. The body 113, which may be molded from a suitable plastic material, comprises a floor 117, side walls 119 and a face 121 Figs. 2 3 cooperating to define a cavity 123 sized to receive the connector body 15. The face 121 is flat and planar, except for a central wedge shaped projection 125 adapted to be received within the gap 57 and for cam surfaces 127 adapted to cooperate with the cam follower surfaces 65, respectively. Light conductors 129 extend within the receptacle 17 and have their ends mounted in and flush with the face 121 at locations 131, respectively. The locations 131 are arranged to be in confronting and substantially aligned relationship with the exit passages 75, respectively, when the connector body 15 is received within the cavity 123. The floor 117 has a slot 133 to separate the adjacent portions of the receptacle 17 into resilient sections .135 Fig. 1 . A projection 137 is mounted on and carried by each of the side walls 119. The resilient sections 135 and the projections 137 form biasing means or a biasing member capable of exerting inward force on the connector body 15. Of course, the biasing means can be formed in other ways. To attach the connector body 15 to the receptacle 17, the connector body is advanced into the cavity 123 and slid in a direction to bring the faces 47 bind 121 closer together. During this sliding movement, the feet 44 of the connector body 15 slide along the floor 117 of the receptacle 17, and the inner surfaces of the side walls 119, the floor 117, the projection 125 and the confronting surfaces of the connector body 15 form guide means for guiding the connector body along a path in the cavity 123 to place the faces 47 and 121 in confronting relationship and to bring the proximal ends 109 of the light conductors 35 and 37 into engagement with the locations 131. As the connector body 15 is advanced into the cavity 123, the side walls 45 of the connector body 15 engage the projections 137 and urge the resilient sections 135 resiliently away from each other. When the proximal ends 109 are nearly in engagement with the locations 131 as shown in Figs. 2 and 3, the projections 137 engage the cam surfaces 69 and urge the connector body 15 farther into the cavity 123 to place the faces 47 and 121 into engagement and to place the proximal ends 109 into engagement and substantial axial alignment with the locations 131. The projections 137 cooperate with the groove 67 to retain the connector body 15 in the cavity 123 of the recepacle 17. In the position shown in Figs. 2 and 3, the cam follower surfaces 65 are nearly in engagement with the cam surfaces 127. The final advancing motion of the connector body 15 into the cavity 123 causes the cam follower surfaces 65 to engage the cam surfaces 127 to lift the forward end of the connector body 15, and in particular the forward foot 44, off of the floor 117 as shown in Fig. 3a. This elevation of the forward end of the connector body 15 accurately positions the exit passages 75 and brings them into correct alignment with the locations 131. The cam surfaces 127 and the cam follower surfaces 65 also cooperate to assist in holding the connector body 15 in the desired orientation within the cavity 123. The cam surfaces 127 and the cam follower surfaces 65 form a portion of the guiding means for guiding the connector body 15 into the proper location within the cavity 123. Thus, the path along which the connector body 15 moves extends in a first direction, which is generally along the longitudinal axis of the body 113, until the cam follower surfaces 65 contact the cam surfaces 127 and then in a second direction along the cam surfaces 127. This latter portion of movement of the connector body 15 occurs when the faces 47 and 121 are closely adjacent and may be under the influence of the biasing action of the receptacle 17 and the cooperation between the projections 137 and the cam surfaces 69. The cooperation between the projections 137 and the cam surfaces 69 automatically draws the connector body 15 completely into the correct seated position within the cavity 123. This final movement is accompanied by an audible click to inform the operator of the correct seating. The force provided assures that the optical portions, i.e., the proximal ends 109 and the locations 131, will be in contact and in proper registry. In use, the instrument 13 may provide light through one of the light conductors 129 to the light conductor 35, and this light is transmitted through the interface at the faces 47 and 121 to the light conductor 35 which transmits it to the distal opening 25. Assuming that the catheter 11 is correctly positioned within a vein or artery within the patient, the light at the distal opening from the light conductor 35 is directed against the patient s blood. The blood reflects light into the light conductor 37, and the reflected light forms a signal having a characteristic related to the absorption characteristics of the blood. The light signal is transmitted through the light conductor 37 and into the other of the light conductors 129. The light signal is converted to an electrical signal within the receptacle 17 and transmitted to the instrument 13 for processing in accordance with known techniques to determine the oxygenation of the blood. Although an exemplary embodiment of the invention has been shown and described, many changes, modifications and substitutions may be made by one having ordinary skill in the art without necessarily departing from the spirit and scope of this invention.
