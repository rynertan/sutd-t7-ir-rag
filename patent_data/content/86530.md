# A process for making filled articles from polymeric material.

## Abstract
A process of making a hollow article from polymeric ma terial is taught. The article is molded in two parts. The two parts are caused to remain in their respective exterior molds. If the hollow article is to be filled with a desired material, a measured amount of filler material is added to one of the formed parts. The exterior molds are brought into opposed position and seal ing relationship. The space between the exterior molds is purged with a purging gas and subjected to a partial vacuum. The exterior molds are then closed and subjected to a clamp ing pressure to join the part halves together and remove flash from the joint. Portions at least of the exterior molds are heat ed and then cooled. The exterior molds are then opened, and the finished filled article is removed therefrom.
