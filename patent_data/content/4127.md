# Improvements in and relating to a pump for use in atomisers.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a non throttling, anti leak manually reciprocated, plunger pump for attachment to a consumertype liquid dispensing container to provide drip free dispensing of liquid therefrom. The pump has a hollow stemmed skirted plunger 14 which is reciprocable in a pump chamber to draw liquid through an inlet into the chamber from a container, and to discharge it from the chamber to atmosphere through the hollow stem 32 of the plunger. A check valve 54 is positioned in the chamber inlet 50 to allow liquid to enter but prevent its return flow. A differential force actuated control element 56 is nested in the plunger, for reciprocation therewith but having capability for axial movement independently thereof. The control element includes valve means 64 for blocking discharge through the plunger stem and the valve is normally biased to blocking position. In addition the control element cooperates with a fitment or body insert at the inlet end of the pump chamber to provide telescopingly cooperating cylinder and piston members 58,76 which are engaged throughout full reciprocal travel of the plunger and control valve. The fitment includes separate passage 82,83 for venting the cylinder piston combination to the interior of the container through an aperture 92 in the wall of the pump housing, and for communicating the pump chamber with the fluid inlet and dip tube of the pump housing.
