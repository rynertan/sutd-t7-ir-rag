# VARIABLE MECHANICAL ADVANTAGE TORQUE ARM

## Abstract
A variable mechanical advantage variable effective length torque arm assembly 100 for a synchronized trans mission is provided. The torque arm assembly comprises a substantially rigid body 102 fixedly mounted to a shift shaft 36 at one end 104 thereof for axial and rotational move ment therewith. The body is provided with an axially extend ing elongated slot 106 in which a pivot pin 124 is received for pivotably attaching an axially movable control rod 22 to the body of the torque arm assembly. A biasing spring 134 bias the pivot pin to a first end of the slot closer to the axis of the shift shaft to define a first effective length 138 of the tor que arm assembly which biasing force may be overcome by a sufficient resistance to rotation of the shift shaft 36 allow ing the pivot pin to move away from the axis of the shift shaft to define a second effective length 140 of the torque arm assembly greater than the first effective length.
