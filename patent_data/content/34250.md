# Preparation of 5,5 dimethyl 2 hydrazino 1,4,5,6 tetrahydropyrimidine hydrohalide.

## Abstract
A process for preparing 5,5 dimethyl 2 hydrazino 1,4,5,6 tetrahydropyrimidine hydrohalide by reacting neopentyldiamine with a guanidine hydrohalide followed by treating the so formed reaction product with hydrazine to yield the desired tetrahydropyrimidine hydrohalide. Alterna tively, neopentyldiamine, guanidine hydrohalide and hyd razine can be admixed and reacted to yield the desired tet rahydropyrimidine hydrohalide.
