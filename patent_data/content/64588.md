# Fiber optic connector.

## Abstract
A fiber optic connector couples multiple pairs of single fiber 21a d optic transmission lines. The connector includes identical sub assemblies 13, 16 releasably coupled. Each sub assembly has a purality of holders 31a, b to which the ends of the fibers are connected. Each holder has a plug 47a c and a receptacle 46a c fitted into corresponding elements on an aligned holder so as to position the ends of mating fibers in axial alignment for efficient transmission of light energy therebetween. The holders are mounted in a loose arrangement and an elastomeric pad or cushion 37 suspends mated holders. Excessive coupling forces are transmitted through the housings directly and do not affect the holders and fibers carried thereby.
