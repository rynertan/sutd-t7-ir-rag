# ELECTROMAGNETIC ROTARY STIRRING STATOR

## Abstract
Electromagnetic stirring means provides winding coils whose segments run longitudinally along the mould down one side and up the other with the phase relationship of different coils providing the rotary field. The coils are contained in a water tight jacket 24A D, 28A D, 20.22 to avoid contamination by the mould coolant water. Preferably the winding segments are hollow to carry a coolant medium.
