## Description
This invention relates to a new polyether antibiotic A80190, to certain derivatives thereof, and to its preparation by cultivation of novel strains of microorganisms. Westley John W. Westley, Polyether Antibiotics Naturally Occurring Acid Ionophores, Vol. 2, Chemistry, Marcel Dekker New York, 1983 has separated existing polyethers by class and type. Using Westley s system, A80190 is a new member of the Class 1b, type 1 , group of polyethers because it has one spiroketal system. Other members of this group include A 28695 A and B U.S. Patent No. 3,839,558 A204I and II U.S. Patent No. 3,705,238 and A 32887 U.S. Patent No. 4,133,876 . A80190 has the following structure Antibiotic A80190 has been assigned structure A80190 has an acid function capable of forming salts and ester derivatives and has at least one hydroxyl group which can be esterified or which can form ether derivatives or urethane derivatives. The acyl and alkyl ester and alkyl ether derivatives of A80190, urethane derivatives, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of A80190 and of these derivatives are also useful as antibiotics, coccidiostats and as agents which increase feed utilization efficiency. According to one aspect of the invention there is provided a compound of formula I wherein R is hydrogen or, CONHR₁ and R₁ is C₁ to C₇ alkyl, phenyl, pyridyl, furyl, wherein R alkyl or hydrogen, and A80190, and its derivatives, are useful as antibacterial and anticoccidial agents. They improve feed utilization efficiency in ruminants and act as a growth promotant in monogastric animals. In addition, they have insecticidal, herbicidal and antiviral activity. Further, they are useful as ionophores. Methods and compositions pertaining to these uses are also provided. This invention further relates to synergistic compositions of A80190, its acyl and alkyl ester, alkyl ether and urethane derivatives or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof an A80190 compound , together with a compound selected from nicarbazin, 4,4 dinitrocarbanilide, metichlorpindol and certain naphthalenamine or benzenamine compounds. These compositions are useful in controlling coccidiosis in animals. The term acyl means a C₁ to C₇, preferably a C₁ to C₄, alkanoic acid moiety, i.e., radicals of the formula wherein R The term cycloalkyl means cyclic hydrocarbon groups containing from 3 to 7 carbon atoms, such as, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclohexyl and the like, cyclohexyl being preferred. The cycloalkyl group may be substituted by an aryl residue, as defined herein, to form an arylcycloalkyl residue, e.g., 2 phenyl cyclopropyl. The term alkoxy means a C₁ to C₇ lower alkyl group having an oxygen function substituted therein, such as, methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy and the like. The group R₁ can also be phenyl, pyridyl or furyl, especially phenyl, optionally substituted by various groups. A substitutent on a phenyl nucleus is preferably on the 4 position. Examples are 4 alkylaryl, e.g., 4 methylphenyl 4 tolyl 4 halophenyl, e.g., 4 chlorophenyl 4 nitrophenyl 4 aryloxy aryl, e.g., 4 phenoxyphenyl 4 alkoxyphenyl, e.g., 4 methoxyphenyl and 4 alkyl carbonyl phenyl, e.g., 4 methylcarbonyl phenyl or 4 phenylcarbonyl phenyl. The term alkyl means a C₁ to C₇ straight or branched chain hydrocarbon, preferably a C₁ to C₄ hydrocarbon, e.g., methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n butyl, etc. The alkyl group may be substituted by an aryl residue, as defined The salts of A80190 and of its derivatives are useful for separating and purifying the antibiotics. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts are particularly useful. Such salts should have little or no toxicity towards warm blooded animals. Examples of salts are the alkali metal, alkaline earth metal and amine salts of A80190 and of its derivatives. Representative and suitable alkali metal and alkaline earth metal salts of A80190 include the sodium, potassium, lithium, cesium, rubidium, barium, calcium and magnesium salts. Suitable amine salts of A80190 include the ammonium and the primary, secondary, and tertiary C₁ C₄ alkylammonium and hydroxy C₂ C₄ alkylammonium salts. Illustrative amine salts include those formed by reaction of A80190 with ammonium hydroxide, methylamine, It is well known in the veterinary pharmaceutical art that the form of an antibiotic is not ordinarily of great significance when treating an animal with the antibiotic. In most cases, conditions within the animal change the drug to a form other than that in which it was administered. The salt form in which it may be administered is, therefore, not of great significance. The salt form may, however, be chosen for reasons of economy, convenience, and lack of toxicity. Antibiotic A80190 can be produced by culturing an A80190 producing strain of The new Cultures of these two A80190 producing organisms have been deposited and made part of the stock culture collection of the Northern Regional Research Center, Agricultural Research, North Central Region, 1815 North University street, Peoria, Illinois, 61604, from which they are available to the public under the accession numbers NRRL 15877 parent strain and NRRL 15878 the variant strain . Taxonomic studies of the variant were carried out by Frederick P. Mertz of the Lilly Research Laboratories. Based on these studies, the two new organisms are classified as members of a new species of the genus The methods recommended by the International Carbon utilization was determined with ISP No. 9 basal medium to which filter sterilized carbon sources were added to equal a final concentration of 1.0 percent. Plates were incubated at 30 C and read after 14 days. Melanoid pigment production chromogenicity was determined with ISP No. 1 tryptone yeast extract broth , ISP No. 6 peptone yeast extract iron agar , ISP No. 7 tyrosine agar and modified ISP No. 7 which has tyrosine removed. Starch hydrolysis was determined by testing for the presence of starch with iodine on ISP No. 4 inorganic salts starch agar plates See Blazevic and Ederer, Morphology was studied using an optical light microscope. A scanning electron microscope SEM was used to study the spore surface ornamentation. NaC1 tolerance was measured by adding NaC1 to ISP No. 2 agar to equal the concentration desired. ICSS NBS Centroid Color Charts, standard sample No. 2106 National Bureau of Standards, 1958, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, D.C. and the Color Harmony Manual 4th ed., Container Corporation of America, Chicago, Illinois, 1958 were used to assign color names. The isomers of diaminopimelic acid DAP and the carbohydrates in hydrolysates of whole cells were established by the chromatographic methods of Becker et al. B. Becker, M. P. Lechevalier, R. E. Gordon, and H. A. Lechevalier, Rapid Differentiation between Resistance to lysozyme was measured by methods recommended by Gordon R. E. Gordon and D. A. Barnett, Resistance to Rifampin and Lysozyme of Strains of Some Species of Resistance to antibiotics was measured by padding antibiotic sensitivity discs onto the surface of seeded ISP No. 2 agar plates. Phosphatase and urease were determined by methods described by Blazevic, Mycolic acids were determined by a method based on techniques described by Minnikin D. E. Minnikin, L. Alshamaony and M. Goodfellow, Differentiation of Phospholipid anlaysis was performed as described by Lechevalier M. P. Lechevalier, C. De Bievre and H. Lechevalier, Chemotaxonomy of Aerobic Actinomycetes Phospholipid Composition, Growth of the organism was generally poor on chemically defined media but better on complex organic media. Aerial mycelia were absent except for trace amounts on ISP No. 4 and sodium butyrate agar. When spores were present, their color was oyster white in the Tresner and Backus System H. D. Tresner and E. J. Backus, System of Color Wheels for Streptomycete Taxonomy, Spore chains were sparsely produced on ISP No. 4 and sodium butyrate agar. Sporophores contained approximately 10 spores per chain, and were generally flexuous as in the Rectus flexibilis RF configuration. However, hooked sporophores were also observed. The aerial hyphae had a tendency to clump together. Spore shape was oblong and ranged in size from 0.5 0.7 µm by 0.9 1.3 µm. The average spore size measured 1.1 by 0.6 µm. The spore surface ornamentation was smooth. Table II lists the carbohydrate utilization pattern of the strain as compared to that of Table III lists the resistance of the strain to various antibiotics at the concentrations indicated and compares it to that of NRRL 15878 grew at temperatures from 15 42 C, and tolerated up to 2 percent NaCl. It produced catalase, phosphatase and urease. NRRL 15878 degraded casein, DNA, esculin, and gelatin, but not adenine, calcium malate, chitin, elastin, guanine, hippurate, hypoxanthine, keratin, starch, testosterone, tyrosine or xanthine. Hydrolyzed whole cells contained the NRRL 15878 has a Type III cell wall, Type B whole cell sugar pattern, and a Type PI phospholipid pattern. This chemotaxonomic information plus its general cultural characteristics are consistent with the assignment of the strain to the genus Comparison of its characteristics to those in published descriptions of known species of The culture resembles According to Lechevalier 1970 , Because of the culture s similarity to The morphology of NRRL 15878 is similar to that of The differences and similarities between NRRL 15878 and Table V shows these similarities and differences in greater detail. These comparisons indicate that the NRRL 15877 and NRRL 15878 cultures are significantly different from other species of As is the case with other organisms, the characteristics of the A80190 producing culture of this invention, The culture medium used to grow the A preferred nitrogen source is collagen hydrolysate, although enzyme hydrolyzed casein, meat peptones, fish meal, liver meal, and the like are also useful. Among the nutrient inorganic salts which can be incorporated in the culture media are the customary soluble salts capable of yielding zinc, sodium, magnesium, calcium, ammonium, chloride, carbonate, sulfate, nitrate and like ions. Essential trace elements necessary for the growth and development of the organism should also be included in the culture medium. Such trace elements commonly occur as impurities in other substituents of the medium in amounts sufficient to meet the growth requirements of the organism. Foaming is not usually a problem, but small amounts i.e. 0.2 ml L of an antifoam agent such as polypropylene glycol may be added to large scale fermentation media if needed. For production of substantial quantities of antibiotic A80190, submerged aerobic fermentation in tanks is preferred. Small quantities of A80190 may be obtained by shake flask culture. Because of the time lag in antibiotic production commonly associated with inoculation of large tanks with the spore form of the organism, it is preferable to use a vegetative inoculum. The vegetative inoculum is prepared by inoculating a small volume of culture medium with the spore form or mycelial fragments of the organism to obtain a fresh, actively growing culture of the organism. The vegetative inoculum is then transferred to a larger tank. The vegetative inoculum medium can be the same as that used for larger fermentations, but other media are also suitable. A80190 is produced by the A80190 producing organism when grown at temperatures between about 25 and about 37 C. An optimum temperature for A80190 production appears to be about 30 32 C. As is customary in submerged aerobic culture processes, sterile air is blown into the vessel from the bottom while the medium is stirred with conventional turbine impellors. The maximum oxygen uptake of the fermentation under the conditions used thus far has not exceeded about 0.2 mM L minute. In a fully baffled 165 liter fermentor containing approximately 115 liters of broth, an aeration rate of 0.125 v v m with an agitation date of 200 rpm is sufficient to maintain the level of dissolved oxygen at or above 30 of saturation. Production of antibiotic A80190 can be followed during the fermentation by testing samples of the broth for antibiotic activity against organisms known to be sensitive to the antibiotic. One assay organism useful in testing A80190 is Following its production under submerged aerobic fermentation conditions, A80190 can be recovered from the fermentation medium by methods used in the fermentation air. The antibiotic activity produced during fermentation of the A80190 producing organism occurs both in the filtered broth and in the mycelial mass. Maximum recovery of A80190 is accomplished, therefore, by initially filtering the medium to separate the broth from the mycelial mass. The filtered broth and the mycelial mass can then be purified separately to give their respective portion of A80190. A variety of techniques may be used in this purification. A preferred technique for purification of the filtered broth involves adjusting it to a pH of about 9 and extracting with a suitable solvent such as, for example, ethyl acetate. The extracting solvent can then be evaporated under vacuum to give the broth portion of A80190. A preferred method of purifying the mycelial mass is to extract the separated mycelial filter cake with a suitable solvent such as, for example, methanol or acetone. The extracting solvent is then evaporated under vacuum to give a concentrated aqueous solution. This aqueous solution is then adjusted to a pH of about 9 and is extracted with a suitable solvent such as, for example, ehtyl acetate. The extracting solvent is then concentrated under vacuum to give the mycelial portion of A80190. The broth and mycelial portions of the A 80190 complex are further purified by similar procedures. A preferred procedure involves silica gel chromatography. Alternatively, the culture solids, including medium constituents and mycelium can be used without extraction or separation, but preferably after removal of water, as a source of A80190. For example, after production of A80190, the whole fermentation broth can be dried by lyophilization, by drum drying, or by azeotropic distillation and drying. The dried broth is then mixed directly into feed premix. The alkali metal and alkaline earth metal cationic salts of A80190 are prepared according to procedures commonly used for the preparation of cationic salts. For example, the free acid of A80190 is dissolved in a suitable solvent such as acetone a 1 3 volume of water is added and this solution is adjusted to a pH of about 9 to 10 with the base of the desired cationic salt e.g. NaOH, KOH . The salt thus formed can be isolated by routine methods, such as filtration or evaporation of the solvent. A preferred method of forming salts is to dissolve A80190 acid form in a water immiscible solvent such as ethyl acetate, add an equal volume of water, and adjust the mixture to pH 10 with the corresponding cationic base e.g. NaOH, KOH, etc. The separated organic phase is washed with water and concentrated to dryness. The residue is lyophilized from dioxane. The salt can be crystallized from an appropriate solvent, such as pentane. The salts formed with organic amines can be prepared similarly. For example, the gaseous or liquid amine can be added to a solution of A80190 in a suitable solvent such as acetone the solvent and excess amine can be removed by evaporation. A80190 acyl ester derivatives are prepared by treating A80190 with a corresponding acid anhydride or acid chloride. Esterification occurs at one of the A80190 hydroxyl groups. Such esters are typically prepared by reacting A80190 with, for example, the corresponding acid anhydride at room temperature. A80190 alkyl ester derivatives are prepared by esterification of the carboxyl group, using standard procedures. The A80190 alkyl ester derivatives are typically less active when tested The alkyl ether derivatives of A80190 are those compounds wherein one or more of the hydroxyl groups has been replaced by a YR group wherein The term hydroxyalkyl refers either to a monohydroxy C₂ C₅ alkyl moiety or, when Y is O, to the 2,3 dihydroxyprop 1 yl moiety. The term haloalkyl refers to a C₂ C₅ alkyl moiety having from one to three halogen substituents, selected from the group consisting of bromine, chlorine, and fluorine. When the alkyl moiety is dihalo or trihalo substituted, the halo substituents must be the same halogen moiety. Preferred A80190 ether derivatives are those compounds wherein Y represents O and R represents C₁ to C₆ alkyl. The ether derivatives are prepared by reacting A80190, or a salt thereof, with a corresponding primary alcohol or thiol. With some of the starting alcohols or thiols it may be necessary to add an acid catalyst to the reaction. Suitable catalysts include hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, methanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, toluenesulfonic acid, selenium dioxide, and boron trifluoride. A solvent such as, for example, water, acetone, benzene, ether, tetrahydrofuran, or dioxane may be added to facilitate the reaction. Reactions generally occur at room temperature, although higher temperatures, for example up to 100 C, may be used. Although ordinary reaction work up procedures are sometimes sufficient, additional purification may be required to obtain the compounds of this invention. Such purification may be accomplished by well known methods, such as, for example, column chromatography, thin layer chromatography, fractional crystallization and the like. The A80190 urethane derivatives of formula Preferably, a salt of A80190, in particular the sodium salt, is used. The isocyanate of formula The A80190 compounds inhibit the growth of bacteria and fungi which are pathogenic to animal and plant life. The inhibitory activity of A80190 is illustrated in Table VI. Activity was measured by the conventional disc diffusion method 6 mm pads were dipped in solutions containing 1 mg of compound per ml of solution pads were placed on agar plates seeded with test organism . One important aspect of the antimicrobial activity of A80190 compounds relates to their activity against anaerobic bacteria. The minimal inhibitory concentrations MIC s at which A80190 inhibits various anaerobic bacteria, as determined by standard agar dilution assay, are summarized in Table VII. End points were read after 24 hour incubation. Anticoccidial activity is an important property of the A80190 compounds. Table VIII summarizes the results of an in vitro tissue culture screen of A 80190 compounds vs. For treating coccidiosis in poultry, a non toxic anticoccidial amount of an A80190 compound is administered to infected or susceptible birds, preferably orally on a daily basis. The A80190 compound can be supplied in many ways, but it is most conveniently supplied with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, preferably the feed ingested by the birds. Although a variety of factors must be considered in determining an appropriate concentration of A80190 compound, the rates of administration are generally in the range of about 2 to about 100 ppm in the feed and are preferably in the range of about 15 to about 50 ppm of feed ration. In another aspect, this invention relates to compositions for treating coccidiosis comprising an effective amount of an A80190 compound for treating coccidiosis, together with a suitable vehicle. Compositions for controlling coccidiosis in poultry of this invention comprise In formula The term halogen represents fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine. C₁ C₄ Fluoroalkyl is a C₁ C₄ alkyl group bearing one or more fluorine atoms. Such fluoroalkyl groups include trifluoromethyl, 1,1,2,2 tetrafluoroethyl, pentafluoroethyl, 1,2,3,3 tetrafluoropropyl, nonafluorobutyl, and the like. C₁ C₄ Fluoroalkoxy is a C₁ C₄ alkoxy group bearing one or more fluorine atoms. Such fluoroalkoxy groups include difluoromethoxy, trifluoromethoxy, 1 fluoroethoxy, 1,1,2,2 tetrafluoroethoxy, pentafluoroethoxy, 1,2,2,3,3 pentafluoropropoxy, heptafluoropropoxy, 4,4,4 trifluorobutoxy, and the like. C₁ C₄ Fluoroalkylthio is a C₁ C₄ alkylthio group bearing one or more fluorine atoms. Such fluoroalkylthio groups include trifluoromethylthio, 1,1,2,2 tetrafluoroethylthio, pentafluoroethylthio, 4,4,4 trifluorobutylthio, and the like. Preferred formula Typical formula Nicarbazin and 4,4 dinitrocarbanilide are taught in U.S. Patent 2,731,382. Nicarbazin is a complex of 4,4 dinitrocarbanilide and 2 hydroxy 4,6 dimethylpyrimidine, but the 4,4 dinitrocarbanilide alone exhibits anticoccidial activity. See The components of the combinations of an A80190 compound with compounds 2 a e are used in amounts which, in combination, are synergistic as to at least one coccidiosis causing organism. In general, the maximum amounts to be used in the combinations are the same as the maximum amounts for anticoccidial treatment by the individual components. The lower limits are generally less than that required for therapy by the individual components. Accordingly, the present invention is generally practiced with compositions containing 1 from about 2 to about 100 ppm of an A80190 compound and 2 a from about 5 to 125 ppm of nicarbazin, b from about 25 to about 150 ppm of 4,4 dinitrocarbanilide, c from about 1 to about 1000 ppm of the specified napthalenamine, d from about 5 to about 125 ppm of a specified benzenamine, or e from about 20 to about 70 ppm of metichlorpindol. The A 80190 compounds are particularly effective when administered with nicarbazin. Preferred combinations contain from about 2 to about 20 ppm of an A80190 compound with from about 5 to about 50 ppm of nicarbazin. Another important property of the A80190 compounds is the ability to improve feed utilization efficiency in animals. For example, the A80190 compounds improve feed utilization efficiency in ruminants which have a developed rumen function. The efficiency of feed use can be monitored by observing the production and concentration of propionate compounds in the rumen using the method described by Arthur P. Raun in U.S. Patent 3,794,732 see especially Example 5 . Table IX shows the ratio of volatile fatty acid VFA concentrations in A80190 treated flasks to concentrations in control flasks in this test. The A80190 compounds are typically effective in increasing propionates and, thereby, the efficiency of feed utilization when administered to ruminants orally at rates of from about 0.02 mg kg day to about 1.5 mg kg day. Preferable rates of administration are from about 0.05 mg kg day to about 0.5 mg kg day. A preferred method of administration is to mix the compound with the animals feed however, it can be administered in other ways, for example, tablets, drenches, boluses, or capsules. Formulation of these various dosage forms can be accomplished by methods well known in the veterinary pharmaceutical art. Each individual dosage unit should contain a quantity of a compound of this invention directly related to the proper daily dose for the animal to be treated. This invention further relates to feed compositions adapted to increase feed utilization comprising feed ration and from 2.5 to 25 grams per ton of an A80190 compound. As described The A80190 compounds are also anthelmintic agents. For example, A80190 is active against In another aspect the A80190 compounds are useful in the treatment of swine dysentery. A80190 inhibits the growth of This invention further relates to feed compositions for treating swine dysentery comprising swine ration and an effective amount of an A80190 compound for this purpose. As discussed, an effective amount is typically one in the range of from about 20 to about 500 grams of A80190 compound per ton of feed. The A80190 compounds can be administered to animals orally or parenterally. They can also be administered by insufflation, i.e. by blowing the antibiotic, in the form of a medicated dust, into an enclosed space or room wherein the animals or poultry are held. The animals or poultry breathe the medicated dust present in the air the medicated dust also is taken into the body through the eyes a process called intraocular injection . The most practical way to administer the A80190 compounds is by formulation into the feed supply. A variety of feeds, including the common dry feeds, liquid feeds, and pelleted feeds, may be used. Although the preferred method of administration is by mixing it with the animals feed, it can also be administered in other ways, for example, tablets, drenches, boluses, or capsules. Each individual dosage unit should contain a quantity of A80190 compound directly related to the proper daily dose for the animal to be treated. The methods of formulating drugs into animal feeds are well known. A preferred method is to make a concentrated drug premix which in turn is used to prepare medicated feeds. Typical premixes may contain from about 1 to about 200 grams of drug per pound of premix. Premixes may be either liquid of solid preparations. The final formulation of feeds for animals or poultry will depend upon the amount of drug to be administered. The common methods of formulating, mixing, an pelleting feeds may be used to prepare feeds containing an A80190 compound. The A80190 compounds may be formulated for parenteral administration by methods recognized in the veterinary pharmaceutical art. Effective injectable compositions containing the A80190 compounds may be in either suspension or solution form. In the solution form, the A80190 compound is dissolved in a physiologically acceptable carrier. Such carriers comprise a suitable solvent, preservatives such as benzyl alcohol, if needed, and buffers. Useful solvents include, for example, alcohols, glycols, or inert oils such as vegetable oils or highly refined mineral oils. Injectable suspension compositions are prepared using a nonsolvent for the compound with adjuvants, as a carrier. The nonsolvent can be, for example, water or a glycol such as polyethylene glycol. Suitable physiologically acceptable adjuvants are necessary to keep the compound suspended in suspension compositions. The adjuvants may be chosen from among thickeners such as carboxymethylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gelatin, and the alginates. Many surfactants are also useful for suspending the compounds. Lecithin, alkylphenol polyethylene oxide adducts, naphthalenesulfonates, alkylbenzenesulfonates, and the polyoxyethylene sorbitan esters are useful suspending agents in liquid nonsolvents. Many substances which affect the hydrophilicity, density, and surface tension of the liquid nonsolvent can assist in making injectable suspensions in individual cases. For example, silicone antifoams, glycols, sorbitol, and sugars can be useful suspending agents. In the preparation of dusts or powders for administration by insufflation, the compounds are typically mixed with talc, diatomaceous earth, or some other inert substance as an adjuvant. The A80190 compounds are also useful as insecticides and acaricides. For example, A80190 is active against the following insects as levels as low as the level indicated in parenthesis mosquito larvae 50 ppm , blowfly larvae 35 ppm , adult housefly 35 ppm , and Mexican bean beetle and southern armyworm 100 ppm . A80190 is also active against mites such as two spotted spider mite when applied at a rate as low as 25 ppm. In another aspect, the A80190 compounds have herbicidal activity. For example, A80190 is active against crabgrass, mustard and pigweed at 2 lb acre 200 gpa either pre emergence or post emergence. The A80190 compounds are active against polio virus. For example, tissue culture tests show that A80190 is active against Polio III virus at a level of 2000 µg ml. Antibiotic A80190 exhibits ion transport properties and is, therefore, an ionophore ion bearer see B. C. Pressman, Alkali metal chelators the ionophores, in Inorganic Biochemistry, Volume 1, G. L. Eichhorn, Elsevier, 1973 . At a 0.5 µg ml concentration A80190 showed ionophorous activity its activity with Na , K and Rb was better than that with Cs or Li . At a lower concentration 0.2 µg ml , however, A80190 exhibited an even greater ionophorous effect with Cs than with Na as cation. A80190 can be used, therefore, when the selective removal of particular cations is desired. Examples of such uses include the removal and recovery of silver ions from solutions in photography, the removal of toxic cations from industrial waste streams before such streams are discharged to the environment, and desalinization of sea water. A80190 can be used as one component of an ion specific electrode see O. Kedem, A80190 alters the cation permeability of both natural and artificial membranes. A80190 can be used, therefore, as a component in a membrane used for the selective transport of cations against a concentration gradient. One potential application of this property is in recovery of heavy and precious metals on a commercial basis see E. L. Cussler, D. F. Evans, and Sister M. A. Matesick, In yet another aspect, the A80190 compounds are active as inhibitors of the enzyme ATPase. ATPase, an alkali metal sensitive enzyme found in cell membranes, is involved in the energy necessary for active transport. Active transport refers to the energy requiring series of operations whereby intracellular and extracellular fluids maintain their compositions. Inhibitors of ATPase reduce the energy required for active transport. The A80190 compounds are also potential cardiotonic agents. In order to illustrate more fully the operation of this invention, the following examples are provided The culture Slants or plates are prepared by adding 2.5 agar to the seed medium. The inoculated slant is incubated at 30 C. for from about 10 to about 14 days. The mature slant culture is scraped with a sterile tool to loosen the spores and remove and mascerate the mycelial mat. About one fourth of the loosened spores and culture growth thus obtained is used to inoculate 50 ml of a first stage seed medium. The inoculated first stage medium is incubated in a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask at 30 C. for about 48 hours on a shaker orbiting in a two inch 5.08 cm circle at 250 rpm. This incubated first stage medium 0.4 ml is used to inoculate 50 ml of a production medium having the following composition The inoculated production medium is incubated in a 250 ml wide mouth Erlenmeyer flask at 30 32 C. for 8 to 10 days on a shaker orbiting in a two inch circle at 250 rpm. In order to provide a larger volume of inoculum, 10 ml of incubated first stage medium, prepared as described in Section A, is used to inoculate 400 ml of a second stage growth medium having the same composition as that of the first stage medium. This second stage vegetative medium is incubated in a two liter wide mouth Erlenmeyer flask for about 48 hours at 30 C. on a shaker orbiting in a two inch circle at 250 rpm. Incubated second stage vegetative medium 800 ml thus prepared is used to inoculate 100 liters of sterile production medium, prepared as described in Section A. The inoculated production medium is allowed to ferment in a 165 liter stirred fermentation tank for 8 to 10 days at a temperature of 30 32 C. Low airflow 0.12 0.25 v v m and low rpm 150 200 in the stirred vessel maintain a dissolved oxygen level above 30 of air saturation. Whole fermentation broths from two 100 L tanks were combined 207 L and filtered through a filter press with the aid of Hyflo Supercel. The mycelial filter cake was extracted by circulating methanol 40 L through the filter press. Acetone can also be used as an extractant. The methanol extract, concentrated The residue was dissolved in toluene 100 ml and applied to a column containing 2 L of silica gel Woelm, 70 150 mesh in toluene. The column was eluted first with toluene 10 L and then with toluene ethanol mixtures 49 1, 10 L and 48 2, 10 L , collecting 1 L fractions. Elution was monitored by bioassay and TLC. Fractions containing A80190 were combined and concentrated. The residue was dissolved in dioxane and freeze dried to yield 13.6 g of crude A80190. Crude A80190 20.4 g , obtained from four 100 L tanks as described in Examples 1 and 2, was dissolved in acetonitrile 200 ml . The solution was applied to a column containing 2 L of silica gel Woelm, 70 150 mesh in acetonitrile. The column was washed with acetonitrile 10 L and eluted sequentially with acetonitrile acetone mixtures 95 5, 2 L , 9 1, 10 L , 4 1, 10 L and 7 3, 10 L , collecting 1 L fractions. Elution was monitored by bioassay, using Purified A80190 28.2 g , was dissolved in acetone 500 ml . Water 500 ml was added, and the pH was adjusted to 5.0 with dilute hydrochloric acid. The resulting solution was allowed to stand at room temperature for 20 hours for crystallization to occur.

Using a procedure like that of Example 24 and the appropriate alcohol or thiol, the following A80190 ether derivatives can be prepared A80190 is prepared by the method of Example 1, but using the A balanced, high energy ration adapted to feed chicks for rapid weight gain is prepared by the following recipe These substances are mixed in accordance with standard feed mixing techniques. Chicks fed such a ration, with water A balanced high grain beef cattle ration is prepared as follows The mixed feed is compressed into pellets. At an average daily ingestion rate of 15 pounds of feed per animal, this feed supplies approximately 300 mg of A80190 Na salt per animal per day. For 200 pounds of this ration, a premix is prepared by adding A80190 10 g to a small amount of solvent extracted soybean feed, grinding them in a mortar and pestle, and diluting the ground mixture to one pound with additional solvent extracted soybean feed. This premix is then added to 200 lb. of the above described swine ration, mixing by standard techniques. This medicated feed provides a level of 100 grams of A80190 per ton of basal ration. Medicated feed is fed to sows for at least one day, and preferably from seven to ten days, prior to farrowing and after farrowing for as long as is desirable. Larger or smaller quantities of medicated ration with varying levels of A80190 are prepared by varying the quantity of A80190 in the premix and or the quantity of basal ration. Sows are fed at rates of from 1.0 to 10 grams of A80190 per 100 pounds of feed. The medicated feed is available A80190 is dissolved in a small amount of ethanol. This ethanol solution is suspended in polyethylene glycol 200. The suspension is concentrated so that each unit dose has a volume of about 0.5 to 2 ml. Such suspensions are given to young pigs at rates of 0.5 to 50 mg per lb, three times a day by gavage. A premix is prepared by standard methods using the following ingredients This premix is added to commercial swine ration, using standard feed mixing techniques, to give a final level of active compound of 100 grams ton. Demonstration of the synergistic effect with nicarbazin in combination with A80190 was obtained as follows one week old broiler chicks were alloted to five bird cages and were fed a medicated or control ration, typically for one day, prior to infection with oocysts of a coccidiosis causing organism. The chicks were maintained on their respective rations for a period of time, typically seven days. There were four replicates per treatment. The chicks were inoculated with 200,000 oocysts of
