# IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO FLUIDISED BED SYSTEMS

## Abstract
An air classifier system for classifying bed particles inclu des a drop tube 9 leading from a reaction chamber 2 and communicating with a discharge tube 12 in which is located a gas ejector 16 . The classifier 18 in which air is used as an aerodynamic sieve to entrain particles of an acceptable size for return through the conduit 14 to the bed 4 . Oversize particles descend through the classifier 18 for discharge into a receptacle 28 .
