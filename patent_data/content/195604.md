# Production of polyester and toner containing the same.

## Abstract
A polyester to use for an electrophotographic toner composition is obtained by copolycondensation between a a diol component of polyoxyalkylene bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane and b an acid component, improved by incorporat ing into the acid component a copolymer of styrene or a derivative thereof and a carboxylic vinlyl monomer. Instead a copolymer of an unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon and an unsaturated carboxylic acid and a polymer and copolymer of an unsaturated carboxylic acid may be used. The toner is improved in prevention of off set in the fixation step.
