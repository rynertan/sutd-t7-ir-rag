# BUS BROADCAST METHOD AND APPARATUS

## Abstract
A broadcast channel capability is added to a multip rocessing combined bus implementation. A transmitter channel portion includes means for continually locking out other combined bus coupled modules from control of the combined bus until the data broadcast is complete. Circuitry is also provided for generating a delayed local broadcast acknowledge since the receiver modules will not generate a normal acknowledge signal due to unique decoding of the receiver circuitry. Receiver circuitry includes data latches into which data words transmitted during the broadcast are sequentially launched. The data latches are coupled to the receiver s CPU data bus. Circuitry is provided for signalling the receiver s CPU when the transfer is complete.
