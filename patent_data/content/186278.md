# Detecting defects in transparent articles.

## Abstract
An apparatus and method for detecting sidewall and dimensional defects in transparent containers includes a laser scanning system 40, 42, 44 positioned astride a conveyor 12 in a production line. In an upstream inspection zone a laser beam vertically scans a portion of the side wall of the container. Photosensors 62, 64, 66, 68 positioned in a detection chamber 56 detect the specific effect which any defect has upon the laser beam by determining the location of light passing through the container and comparing its intensity against pre set thresholds. A flaw signal is gener ated when a threshold is exceeded. The number of flaw signals is counted 78 and when the count equals a pre set value a reject signal is generated 98 to eject the defective container from the conveyor. If a container is not rejected, is passes through a rotator assembly which rotates the contain er precisely 90 . The container then continues to a similar downstream inspection zone where an indentical scanning and detection process is repeated with regard to the previously uninspected portions of the side wall of the container.
