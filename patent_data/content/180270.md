# Terminal connector for an electrochemical accumulator battery.

## Abstract
Means for providing an electrical connection between adja cent cells in an electrochemical accumulator battery through an opening in a cell wall made of plastic material. In a joint 10 consisting of a screw 32 passed through concentric openings 16, 28, 30 in the leg 24, 26 of each plate group bus 20, 22 and in the cell wall 18 and a nut 34 holding the joint together, each leg 24, 26 is arranged tightly against the cell wall 18 . Around the screw 32 there ist arranged in the openings 16 in the cell wall an annular spacer 36 of greater external diameter than the openings in the legs and with a thickness smaller than that of the cell walls and made of a harder material than the cell walls.
