# Method and apparatus for nuclear magnetic resonance.

## Abstract
Nuclear magnetic resonance NMR apparatus for regi stering the NMR of a specific atomic nucleus in a body, includ ing magnet apparatus 1, 2, 3 for generating a compound mag netic field having a specified configuration in the region of the body P , oscillator apparatus 6 for applying an oscillating electromagnetic field to the body P , and receiver means 8 11 for detecting NMR signals from the body P and recon structing a display on the basis of NMR signals from the body on the basis of NMR signals. The magnet apparatus is arran ged to form the magnetic field into a narrow beam and means 2, 4, 5 are provided for causing relative movement of the body P and the beam so as to scan the body P with the beam.
