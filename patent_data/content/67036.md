# Method of separating zirconium isotopes.

## Abstract
Method of altering the zirconium 91 isotopic content of zirconium by raising a zirconium chelate ligand from a ground state to an activated state in the presence of a scavenger which reacts with the activated state but not with the ground state, and permitting from 25 to 75 of the zirconium chelate to react with the scavenger. The reaction may be performed in a solution of the zirconium chelate ligand using water as a solvent, Activation of the zirconium chelate may be accomplished by using light and having a wavelength of from 220 to 350 nm or by heating to from 80 to 100 C.
