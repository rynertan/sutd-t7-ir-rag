# Liquid liquid centrifugal contacting machine.

## Abstract
A rotor has a coaxial hollow casing 18 with a plurality of concentric radially spaced sieves or screens 22 therein. At least one light phase liquid inlet tube 25 has communication with the radially outer portion of the rotor chamber 21 , and at least one heavy phase liquid inlet tube 24 has communica tion with the radially inner portion of the rotor chamber 21 to supply light and heavy phase fluids, respectively, to the chamber casing. The heavy phase liquid moves radially out ward and is removed from the outermost portion of the rotor chamber while the light phase liquid moves radially inwardly and is removed from the radially inner portion of the rotor chamber. The machine is constructed with concentric, radially open distributor or dispersing trays 36, 41 within the rotor chamber 21 communicating directly with each of the light and heavy phase liquid inlet tubes 25,24 . Each tray 36,41 includes an annular base wall 38,38 with radially projecting walls projecting in the form of open ended risers 39, 39 which have large diameter passages extending through them and which are surrounded by considerably smaller diameter passages 37,37 in the base wall 38, 38 . The riser walls 39,39 are of at least such radial extent as to collect a suffi cient head of the phase being distributed to pass the phase to be dispersed through the smaller base wall openings 37,37 under pressure of the tray head developed, without coun tercurrent flow of the other phase through them. The riser openings 39,39 provide flow of the continuous other phase not being distributed counter directionally through the ris ers 39,39 under the driving force of the head, and are suffi ciently large to somewhat minimize appropriately the flow force at the riser openings 39,39 and control the counter directional flow.
