# Engine generated waveform analyzer.

## Abstract
An internal combustion engine analyzer provides both data acquisition and data processing and includes an analog waveform analysis subsystem together with a general purpose background system wherein appropriate power distribution is provided for the system as a whole and peripheral equipment such as a printer, keyboard and an analog digital CRT is also provided. The input signals to be analyzed are waveforms generally associated with internal combustion engines and peripheral equipment. Exemplary waveforms are the primary and secondary ignition wave forms. The waveforms are attenuated to reasonable levels and multiplexed to analog circuitry which serves to measure waveform magnitude at one or more sampling points along the length of the wave and to also measure the manner in which the characteristics of the waveform change. The analog measurements are digitized and coupled to a processor which in turn controls the operation of the analog circuitry. The digitized measurements together with previously entered engine identification data are analyzed by the processor to thereby control subsequent data taking and to generate appropriate maintenance and repair instructions which are communicated visually to an operator in the disclosed embodiment.
