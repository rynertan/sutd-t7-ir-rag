# ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS COMPRISING TEMPERATURE SENSITIVE DEVICE

## Abstract
An electrical system which comprises 1 a temperature sensitive device comprising a PTC or NTC element, 2 a load in series with the temperature sensitive device and 3 a con trol device in parallel with the load and the temperature sensi tive device. The control device is a device whose resistance can be changed from a high value which may be infinite to a low value or vice versa, by a change in the electrical or physical environment thereof, e.g. a diode, triac, thyristor, PTC device or NTC device. By an appropriate change in the power source, e.g. its size or direction, or in the physical environment of the control device, e.g. its temperature, the relative resistances of the temperature sensitive device and the control device can be reversed, thereby isolating or activating the load. The system is particularly useful for isolating a remote load, e.g. a tele phone, while retaining a continuous circuit e.g. through the legs of a telephone circuit, for example for test purposes.
