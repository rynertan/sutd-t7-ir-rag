# Apparatus for and method of testing the conductive properties of a conductor.

## Abstract
The Figure shows a system for non destructive detection of current restricting defects, such as cracks, narrowing, intermittent opens etc, in a conductor, e.g. a printed conductor. A composite test signal is applied to the test conductor 3 via probes 1 and 2. The signal is produced by a generator circuit 4 comprising a frequency f₀ oscillator 5, amplifier 6 and D.C. source 7. The defects in the conductor 3 cause its resistance to vary at the same frequency as the oscillator signal and cause current variations through the conductor. The signal at node 4A comprises a component Vf₀ at frequency f₀, a component 2f₀GV at twice the frequency f₀ due to the resistive variation of the restricting defect and a component 2f₀CV at two the frequency f₀ due to the resistance heating of the whole conductor, The f₀ component is rejected by filter 8 and the 2f₀ components amplified 9 and filtered by band pass filter 10. The amplified filtered signal is supplied as one input to a phase detector 12, the other input being derived from node 40, frequency doubler 14, band pass filter 15 and phase shifter 16. The detector 12 operates as a phase, sensitive demodulator to suppress the 2f₀CV component and to compare the phase of the 2f₀GV component with the 2f₀ component from phase shifter 16. The result of the comparison is manifested as a DC voltage which is logarithmically amplified and applied to indicator meter 18 and, via threshold detector 19, to defect indicator 20.
