## Description
New compounds with anti inflammatory and anti tussive activity, process for their preparation and relative pharmaceutical compositionsThe present invention relates to a series of N pyridyl amides of 1 phenyl cyclopentancarbo xylic acid having formula I EMI1.1 wherein Py is the pyridine ring, eventually substituted with one or more methyl groups or chlorine atoms0Compounds I proved to be endowed with intere sting pharmacological properties, which make them suitable for the therapeutic use as antiinflammatory agents.The invention relates therefore also to pharmaceutical compositions with antiinflammatory activity containing as active principle one or more amides of formula I .Object of the invention is finally provided by a process for the preparation of N pyridylamides I , characterized in that activated deriva tives of 1 phenyl cyclopentancarboxylic acid, having general formula II , are reacted with aminopyridines III,according to the scheme EMI2.1 In such a scheme, X is an halogen atom, or an alcoxy group, or a residue transforming II in a homogeneous or mixed anhydride R and R , which can be the same or different, are hydrogen atoms, methyl groups or chlorine atoms.The reaction is preferably carried out with a nearly equimolar ratio between II and III it is possible to operate in the absence of sol vents, or preferably in solvents inert in the reaction conditions such as ethyl ether, dioxa ne, chloroform, benzene or toluene , at tempera tures ranging from OOC and the solvent s boiling point. Whereas X is halogen, it is convenient to use an excess of aminopyridine Iii as a hydrohalogen acid acceptor,The same purpose can be achieved by operating in presence of alkaline or alkaline earth metals carbonate or bicarbonate, or in presence of tertiary bases.The following examples illustrate the process ac cording to the invention. EXAMPLE 1 3 1 Phenyl cyclopentyl carbonyl aminopyridi ne 60 Mmoles of 3 aminopyridine, 50 ml of anhydrous benzene and 50 mmoles of anhydrous sodium carbonate, are placed in a three necked flask with a stirrer, reflux condenser and dropping funnell then, a solution of 50 mmoles of chloride of 1 phenyl cyclopentancarboxylic acid, pre pared by reaction of thionyl chloride on the cor responding acid J. Org. Chem. 4, 619 1959 in 50 ml of benzene, is added in small portions and under stirring. When the addition is comple te, the reaction mixture is left under stirring for one hour and is then refluxed for three hours.After hot filtration, benzene is removed under reduced pressure. The residue is re crystallized from ethanol m.p. 122 1230C ethanol . Analytical and spectroscopical data agree with the teoretical data. EXAMPLE 2 2 1 Phenyl cyclopentyl carbony aminopyridine The reaction is carried out according to the exam ple 1, but using 2 aminopyridine instead of 3,ami nopyridine, and substituting sodium carbonate with triethylamine. The product obtained whose structu re is confirmed by analytical and spectroscopical data melts at 86 870C methanol .Similar results are obtained using, instead of acid chloride, the corresponding mixed anhydride, obtained by 1 phenyl cyclopentancarboxylic acid and ethyl chlorocarbonate in the presence of a tertiary base.Starting from such an anhydride, or by 1 phenyl 1 chlorocarbonylcyclopentane, and from the suitable aminopyridine, the following compounds according to the invention are moreover obtained 2 1 phenyl cyclopentyl carbonyl amino 3 me thyl pyridine 2 LTl phenyl cyclopentyl carbonyl7 amino 4 me thylpyridine 2 1 phenyl cyclopentyl carbonyl amino 6 me thyl pyridine 2 1 phenyl cyclopentyl carbonyl amino 4,6 dimethyl pyridine 2 1 phenyl cyclopentyl carbonyl amino 5 chlo ro pyridine.
