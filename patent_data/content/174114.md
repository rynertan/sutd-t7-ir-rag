Background Within the past ten years, transition metal complexes have become valuable agents in the clinical treatment of hnan cancer. Since cisplatin , cis Pt NH3 2Cl2 , was approved by the FDA for treatment of human malignancies, metal complexes have assumed an expanding role in the field of medicine. The widespread success that cisplatin is finding in the clinical treatment of testicular and ovarian cancers has stimulated research in the area of inorganic based anticancer drugs. Recent advances in the clinic have improved the effectiveness of cisplatin and have made it one of Che most promising chemotherapeutic agents that is presently available to the patient. Optimized drug delivery methods, such as prehydration and saline infusion, have been developed to minimize the adverse toxicological effects of the drug. Progress also has been made through recent efforts to expand the scope of cisplatin treatable cancers. A variety of forms of cancer are now being treated with cisplatin and new combination chemotherapy regimens are finding success in a number of clinical programs. While cisplatin has proven successful in many cases, there are some types of cancer that remain unresponsive to treatment with the drug. This factor, coupled with the toxic side effects of the drug, has led to new synthetic research efforts which are directed toward the development of second generation platinum coordination complexes that exhibit a different spectrum of activity as well as decreased toxicity and improved solubility. One possible approach to improvements in drug activity or decreases in toxicity as well as improved properties such as solubility and solution stability is synthesis of compounds containing platinum bound to biologically active molecules thus providing the possibility of new routes for cellular entry or delivery of the drug to the active site. Among the numerous new platinum coordination complexes which are being developed for antitumor activity, one group of new compounds that has shown good activity in a variety of animal tumor screens are the diamineplatinum ascorbates developed at EngelhardCorporation and which are described in U.S. Patents 4,457,926 and 4,462,998. The platinum II amine ascorbate complexes of these above identified applications possess the following general formula cis IPt II A2 X OH I wherein Pt is in valence state II and is coordinated to A in a cis configuration, A is ammonia NH3 or a monodentate alkylamine ligand, A2 is a bidentate diamine ligand,X is the ascorbate moiety, m has a value of from 1 to 2, n has a value of from 0 to 1 and the sum of m and n is not greater than 2. The subscripts m and n may have fractional values between their respective limits in which event formula I represents a mixture of individual complexes. The ascorbate moiety is derived from ascorbic acid as represented by the formula EMI3.1 wherein carbons 4 and 5 are optically active. Accordingly, the ascorbic acid molecule may exist as any one of four optical isomers or as a mixture of same. The ascorbate moiety of the platinum complex can thus be derived from any one of said individual isomers or from a mixture of any two or more of said isomers. The platinum II ascorbate complexes are prepared by contacting in aqueous medium an ascorbate salt with an amine platinum II diaquo salt represented by the formula cis PtA2 H2O 2 2 2 u l wherein A and A2 are as defined above, Z is an inorganic anion, and u is a number having a value of 0 or 1.Suitable anions are those which are stable in acid media they include, for example, the sulfate, nitrate and perchlorate anions although nitrate is preferred. Anions having a greater complexing ability than water or ascorbate, such as chloride, bromide and iodide are not suitable. The 11diaquo salt is formed from the stoichiometric reaction of a cis diamineplatinum II dichioride with a silver salt, preferably silver nitrate, in an aqueous medium at room temperature. Although the platinum amine ascorbate complexes formed by contacting an ascorbate salt with the amine platinum diaquo salt described above showed pronounced activity against malignant tumors in animals and high solubility in water with low toxicity, the platinum amine ascorbate complexes were found to comprise a mixture of platinum amine ascorbate compounds which had not been separated or characterized to determine their exact chemical structure. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the present invention, the individual platinum amine ascorbate complexes which are formed as a mixture in the preparative methods disclosed in U.S. Patents 4,457,926 and 4,462,998 as described above are isolated and characterized, and direct routes of synthesis provided. In addition, analgous materials containing the key structural features of these materials are described. The general formulation for this class of platinum compounds can be written as follows EMI4.1 wherein A1 and A2 are ammonia or aliphatic amine ligands or A1 and A2, taken together, are a chelating diamine ligand. The monodentate amine ligands A1 and A2 may be the same or different and can be represented by the formula RNH2 and include ammonia NH3 and monoalkyl amines having up to 6 carbons in the alkyl group as, for example, methylamine, ethylamine, propylamine, isopropylamine, hexylamine and the like. Alkylamines having up to 3 carbon atoms are preferred. The alkyl group, R, also may contain substituents such as hydroxy, C1 C4 alkoxy, halo, carboxy, C1 C4 alkylcarboxy, or C1 C4 alkoxycarbonyl. The chelating bidentate diamine ligands represented by A1 and A2 taken together are those of following formula IV EMI5.1 wherein each of R1 and R2, taken separately, represent hydrogen or lower alkyl and R1 and R2, taken together, afford a 1,2 diaminocycloalkane ligand containing from about 4 8 nuclear carbon atoms as, for example, 1,2diaminocyclopentane, 1,2 diaminocyclohexane and 1,2diaminocycloheptane which may optionally be substituted on the nuclear carbons by one or more linear or branched chain lower alkyl groups. By the use of the term lower alkyl is meant a linear or branched chain alkyl group of from 1 6 carbons and, preferably, from 1 3 carbons such as methyl, ethyl, or propyl. Preferred diamine ligands IV are those in which at least one of said RÚ and Rê radicals represent hydrogen as, for example, ethylenediamine and propylene 1,2 diamine. Also preferred are diamines wherein R1 and R2, taken together, form a 1,2 diaminocyclohexane moiety. R1 and R2 also may represent such groups as hydroxy, C1 C4 alkoxy, halo, carboxy, C1 C4 alkylcarboxy, or C1 C4 alkoxycarbonyl or alkyl or cycloalkyl groups as defined above carrying these groups as substituents. L1 comprises the carbon bound species below EMI6.1 wherein R3 and R4 may be the same or different and may include hydrogen, C1 C6 alkyl, or C1 C6 alkoxy, or R3 andR4 together form a four to seven merbered alicyclic or heterocyclic ring. These alkyl, or alkoxy groups or four to seven membered rings, may carry substituents including hydroxy, hydroxyalkyl C1 C4 , C1 C4 alkoxy, C1 C4 alkoxyalkyl C1 C4 , halo, carboxy, C1 C4 alkylcarboxy,C1 C4 alkylcarboxyalkyl C1 C4 , C1 C4 alkoxylcarbonyl, orC1 C4 alkoxycarbonylalkyl C1 C4 . R5 may be hydrogen, hydroxy, C1 C4 alkyl, C1 C4 alkoxy or phenyl. L2 may be the same ligand as L1, bound preferably through an oxygen atom or may be a ligand selected from the same group of species as L1, bound preferably through an oxygen atom. L2 may also be OH,H2O, dimethylsulfoxide DMSO , halo, alkylcarboxy, or nitrate, sulfate, or phosphate. When L2 is an uncharged ligand such as eitherH2O or dimethyl sulfoxide DMSO , the complex is charged and therefore, must exist with a counter ion. While any suitable counter ion may be employed, counter ions such as nitrate, perchlorate, acetate phosphate and sulfate This definition includes the ascorbates, whereR3 and R4 together comprise the following EMI7.1 and R5 OH. It also includes the other optical isomers of the ascorbates, including the isoascorbates, as well as ascorbate analogs such as tetramethylreductate EMI8.1 Vb This definition also includes the beta diketonates when R H EMI8.2 and the esters of malonic acid or substituted malonic acids when R3 and R4 V are C1 C6 alkoxy or substitutedC1 C6 alkoxy. As is apparent from the above. description, L may be present in either a 1 1 or 2 1 ratio with platinum.In the former case, the ligand may form a chelate, with binding through carbon and oxygen. In the latter case, the two ligands may be bound through carbon and oxygen respectively. Both types of complexes are present in Pt diamine ascorbate mixtures and tests indicate that both show antitumor activity in animals. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The diamineplatinum ascorbates as set forth n formula I , the preparation of which is described in U,S.Patents 4, 457,926 and 4,462,998, have been found to contain a variety of platinum II complexes. The exact number and structural characteristics of these comp exes were unknown at the time of preparation. It has now been found that the individual lati num II ascorbate complexes which are formed an be characterized by structural formulas such as VI, qI andVIII, Pt ascorbate 1 1 , and corresponding strucXlres in which Pt ascorbate l 2. EMI9.1 More specifically, studies of diaminocyclohexaneplatinum II ascorbate as prepared by methods disclosed in U.S. Patents 4,457,926 and 4,462,998 show that up to eight separate components corresponding to the general formulation I may be formed in the crude product. A major component has been identified as Pt dach ascorbate , as illustrated by structural formulas VI,VII, and VIII. Thus, referring to these structural formulas, four isomeric forms of this complex are produced. These isomeric forms can be explained in terms of the geometry of the dach ligand. The ascorbate ligand is attached to the Pt dach moiety through carbon atom C2 and oxygen atom 05. Since the Pt cis dach portion of the molecule is asymmetric with respect to rotation about the axis that bisects the Nl Pt N2 angle, two possible isomers result when the chelating ascorbate is attached to thePt cis dach unit.For example, the complex that results when C2 is attached trans total VII is not equivalent to the complex that results when C2 is attached trans toN2 VI . These two forms of Pt cis dach ascorbate are different isomers and consequently have different chemical properties. The Pt trans dach ascorbate VIII analog also forms two isomers. Since the trans dach portion of the molecule exists in the two enantiomeric forms S,S andR,R and because ascorbate is itself optically active, Pt trans dach ascorbate exists in two diasteromeric forms. Because the Pt trans dach moiety is symmetric with respect to the axis bisecting the N1 Pt N2 angle, isomerism of the type present in the cis dach complex is absent. Additionally, the Pt dach ascorbate product comprises complexes containing two ascorbate ligands per platinum in which one ascorbate ligand is attached to platinum via a carbon atom and the other through an oxygen atom. Again, as in the case of Pt dach ascorbate the isomerisms and asymmetry of the dach ligand results in four isomers of Pt dach ascorbate 2 . As described above, two of these arise from the non equivalence of the nitrogen atoms in the Pt cis dach moiety and two from the two enantiometric forms of trans dach. It should be understood that the number of possible components in the compounds which are the subject of this invention depends on the nature of the A and L ligands in formula III. Thus, for example, in the case of Pt diamine ascorbate complexes in which the two nitrogens are equivalent and in which the A groups contain no centers of asymmetry, such as in Pt NH3 2 ascorbate n n 1 or 2, the number of possible components is decreased to two. Similarly, the number of possible components will vary in compositions in which L1 and L2 III are different. The complexes of this invention are useful in tumor chemotherapy having been found active against malignant tumors in animas asi for example, Sarcoma 180 ascites tumors in mammals such as mice. The anti tumor effect exhibited by the subject complexes may also extend to other sarcomas, lymphoid leukemias and to such other tumors as the following lymphosarcoma, myelocytic leukemia, malignant lymphoma, squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, scirrhous carcinoma, malignant melanoma, seminoma, teratoma, choriocarcinoma, embryonalcarcinoma, cystadenocarcinoma, endometriocarcinoma or neuroblastoma and the like. In addition, said complexes may be useful as anti viral, anti inflammatory, anti bacterial and anti parasitic agents. It has been found that when the chelated Pt ascorbate 1 1 complexes of this invention are contacted with an aqueous acid solution, the resulting solution has enhanced activity against Sarcoma 180 ascites tumors in mammals in comparison with the unacidified complex. While any suitable acid may be employed, it is presently preferred to use nitric acid, perchloric acid, acetic acid, sulfuric acid, ascorbic acid or mixtures thereof. A combination of nitric acid and ascorbic acid is particularly preferred at present. Compare, for example, the activity screening data in Table III for Pt R,R trans dach ascorbate and the acid treated Pt R,R trans dach ascorbate Ex. 12 .Similarly, Pt ethylenediamine ascorbate , which is acid treated Ex. 11 exhibits enhanced activity when compared with its unacidified form Ex. 10 . As a result of this enhanced activity from the acid treatment, it may be desirable to administer the relatively insoluble complexes orally, allowing the stomach acids to act on the complexes so as to enhance their activity. The complexes of this invention may be administered parenterally or orally in admixture with a non toxic pharmacologically acceptable inert carrier or diluent in any of the usual pharmaceutical forms. These include solid and liquid oral unit dosage forms such as tablets, capsules, powders, and suspensions or solutions for subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous or intra arterial injection. The term unit dosage refers to physically discrete units which may be administered in single or multiple dosages each containing a predetermined quantity of the active ingredient in association with the required diluent, carrier or vehicle. The quantity of active ingredient is the amount of complex needed to produce the desired therapeutic effect. A typical unit dosage consists essentially of from about 10 1,500 mg of active ingredient however, the form in which said ingredient is administered and the frequency of administration is usually determinative of its concentration. Thus, for example, oral unit dosage forms containing 5 1,500 mg of active ingredient may be administered one or more times per day depending upon the severity of the tumor which is sought to be treated and the condition of the host animal. By contrast, parenteral administration generally requires from about 10 400 mg of the active ingredient per unit dosage administered as a daily dose or as a fraction thereof depending upon whether the regimen calls for administration once, twice, three or four times daily. By contrast to the 1unit dosage, the effective dose is that total dosage which is needed to achieve the desired anti tumor effect. In general, this dosage lies within the range of from about 15 3,800 mg of the active ingredient per kg. of body weight of the host animal i.e., mg kg . A preferred concentration lies within the range of from about 50 1,800 mg kg. For oral administration an effective dose of 100 3,800 mg kg has been found to be most suitable, whereas, in the case of parenteral administration it is usually advisable to employ from about 20 1,400 mg kg. These dosages are well below the toxic or lethal does and they may be varied over a wide range for the symptomatic adjustment of the dosage to the patient which is being treated. The preferred compositions for oral administration are tablets in which the active ingredient is present in quantities of 5 1,500 mg in a pharmaceutically acceptable orally ingestible solid carrier. If desired, the composition may also contain flavors, binders, lubricants and other excipients known in the art. An alternative oral mode is the soft gelatin capsule. Such a composition may also contain from 5 1,500 mg by weight of active ingredient dissolved or suspended in vegetable oil , peanut oil, alcohol or giycer ine and the like. A hard or dry filled capsule may be prepared by admixing 25 500 mg of active ingredient with suitable excipients such as lactose and magnesium stearate and putting the mixture into a pre formed and suitably sized gelatin sheath. The complexes of this invention may also be formulated as liquid solutions or suspensions or as a dry powder for addition to foods, drinking water, fruit juice or other potable liquids. Tablets are prepared by mixing a complex of this invention, in suitably comminuted or powdered form, with a diluent or base such as starch, sucrose, kaolin or dicalcium phosphate and the like. The resulting mixture can be granulated by wetting with a binder such as a syrup, starch paste , acacia mucilage or solutions of cellulosic or polymeric materials, whereafter, the wetted mixture is forced through a screen. As an alternative to granulating, the powdered mixture can be run through a tablet machine and any slugs which are imperfect may be broken into granules. The granules are lubricated to prevent sticking to the tablet forming dies via the addition of stearic acid, a stearate salt, talc or mineral oil and the lubricated mixture is then compressed into tablets.The complexes of this invention can also be combined with free flowing inert carriers and then be subjected to compression so as to form tablets without going through the granulating or slugging steps. A protective coating or sealing coat of shellac, sugar or polymeric material and a polished coating of wax can also be provided. Dyestuffs may be added to distinguish different unit dosages. In this invention the term pharmacologically acceptable inert carrier or diluent denotes a non toxic substance which, when mixed with the active ingredient, renders it more suitable for administration. Compositions intended for oral administration may include such carriers or diluents as glucose, lactose, sodium or potassium ascorbate, sucrose, corn starch, potato starch, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate, powdered gum tragacanth, gelatin, alginic acid, agar, stearic acid or the sodium, calcium and magnesium salts of stearic acid, sodium lauryl sulfate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sodium citrate, calcium carbonate and di calcium phosphate. Said compositions may also contain non toxic adjuvants and modifiers such as dyes, buffering agents, preservatives, surfactants, emulsifiers, flavoring agents or biocides and the like. The following embodiments illustrate the preparation of representative unit dosage forms. Compressed Tablet Pt cis dach ascorbate VI 400 mg Sodium Ascorbate 200 mg Niacinamide 50 mg Calcium Pantothenate 20 mg Magnesium Sulfate 50 mg Zinc Sulfate 50 mg Magnesium Stearate 10 mg 780 mgThe Pt 11 complex, sodium ascorbate, niacinamide, calcium pantothenate, magnesium sulfate, zinc sulfate and magnesium stearate 5.0 mg are mixed and compressed into slugs. The slugs are then broken into granules and sifted through an 8 mesh screen. Additional magnesium stearate 5. 0 mg is added and the mixture is then compressed into tablets suitable for oral administration. Soft Gelatin Capsule A soft elastic gelatin capsule is filled with the following ingredients Pt cis dach ascorbate VII 400 mg Wheat germ oil 50 mg Sunflower seed oil 100 mg 550 mg The Pt II complex and wheat germ oil are mixed with sunflower seed oil and the resulting mixture is poured into gelatin capsules suitable for oral administration. An alternative embodiment provides for substituting sunflovser seed oil and wheat germ oil with equal amounts of peanut oil to obtain an otherwise similar capsule which is also suitable for oral administration. Dry Filled Capsule A hard dry filled capsule may be prepared from the following ingredients Pt trans dach ascorbate VIII 200 mg Niacinamide 50 mg Calcium Pantothenate Ip mg Sodium Ascorbate 150 mg 410 mg The Pt II complex is reduced to a No. 60 powder. Niacinamide, calcium pantothenate and sodium ascorbate are passed through a No. 60 bolting cloth and these ingredients are added to the Pt II complex. This combination of ingredients is mixed for 10 minutes and then poured into a No. 3 size gelatin capsule. Dry Powder The following composition illustrates a representative dosage in dry powder form. In this embodiment the active ingredient is water soluble and it is combined with up to 60 by weight of a suitable flavoring agent. All quantities are in a weight percent relationship. Pt cis dach ascorbate 23 25 90 Flavoring Agent 10 60 Preservative 0.1 The Pt II complex, flavoring agent and preservative are thoroughly blended to afford a homogeneous dry powder which is readily soluble in water.The resulting formulation may be used as a food additive or it may be blended with other therapeutic agents to afford combination type medicinals. Alternatively, said powder may be dissolved in a pharmacologically acceptable diluent to afford a solution which is suitable for oral administration. Compositions intended for parenteral administration may include such diluents and carriers as water miscible solvents as, for example, sesame oil, groundnut oil, aqueous propylene glycol and a solution of sodium riboflavin. Typical of said compositions are solutions which contain the active ingredient in sterile form. An embodiment illustrating a dosage. form suitable for intravenous injection is set forth below. Parenteral Solution Injectable solutions can be formulated by mixing an ampoule of active ingredient with an ampoule of sterile diluent Ampoule cis Pt NH3 2 ascorbate 300 mg Ampoule Sterile Water Diluent for Injection 2 ccThe Pt II complex and water are mixed thoroughly immediately prior to administration. If desired, one or more other active ingredients may be added to provide an injectable solution having enhanced therapeutic activity. Method of Preparation The compounds of this invention are prepared from platinum complexes of the type EMI18.1 orEMI18.2 where S is water or an alcohol, A1 and A2 are defined above III , and X is a halide. The platinum complex is usually obtained by reacting PtAlA2X2 X halide, with one or two moles of a silver salt, preferably AgNO3 in the solvent, S. The insoluble silver halide AgX formed is removed leaving, in this case, PtA1A2S2 NO3 2 or PtA1A2 SX j NO3 in solution. The ligands L1 and L2 are as defined above and are either used in the form of alkali metal salts e.g., sodium ascorbate or potassium ascorbate or else the acid forms are reacted with or without one half or more equivalents of an alkali metal hydroxide. The platinum complex as defined above, L1 andL2, are reacted in an aqueous or alcoholic medium. The molar ratio of L1 and L2 to Pt may range from 1 1 to as high as 10 1 but is preferably between 1 1 and 3 1. The concentration of the reactants is not extremely critical and may range from 0.01 to 1,0 molar the preferred concentration is approximately 0.2 molar. L1 and L2 may be added to the platinum solution simultaneously or sequentially with L2 following L1 by as long as 24 hours.In the case where L2 X, PtA1A2L1L2 may be prepared by reacting L1 with PtA1A2XS . In the case where L2 H2O orOH, PtA1A2L1L2 may be prepared by the reaction of L1 with 2 PtA1A2 H2O 2 The reaction mixture is stirred at ambient reaction. If desired, temperatures above or below ambient temperatures as, for example, from about OOC to 600C, may be employed. The reaction may be conducted over a period of several minutes to 72 hours. During this time a precipitate may form, which is then collected. In other cases the product may be precipitated from solution with a non solvent or obtained by removal of solvent from the reaction solution by evaporation. The product as thus obtained may contain a single compound as defined previously or may contain a mixture of such compounds, with or without the presence of unreacted starting material, non Pt and degradation products. In the latter case, the desired products may be obtained in purified form by recrystallization from suitable solvents or via chromatographic techniques. Examples 1 21, infra, illustrate the methods by which the compounds of this invention may be obtained andExample 22 describes the protocol used to evaluate their efficacy in mice. However, said examples are illustrative only and this invention should not be construed as being limited thereto because it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill that obvious modifications may be effected and functionally equivalent reagents may be substituted for those recited therein without departing from the spirit or scope of this invention. Example 1Separation of cis dach and trans dach The resolution of the two isomeric forms of diaminocyclohexane can be accomplished using a published method R. Saito, Y. Kidani, Chem. Lett, 123 1976 . The isomeric dach mixture is reacted with NiCl2. 6H2O in methanol. The resulting nickel complexes, Ni cisdach 2C12 and Ni trans dach 2C12.2H20 differ in solubility and can be easily separated by filtration. The separated nickel complexes are then decomposed by acid and the dach isomers obtained by neutralization and extraction and purified by vacuum distillation. The resulting cis dach and trans dach were converted to Pt cis dach I2 and 1Pt trans dach I2 using a published method S.C. Dhara, Indian J. Chem, 8, 143 1970 . Example 2 Pt cis dach ascorbate and Pt trans dach ascorbate Mixtures Crude ascorbate mixtures were prepared according to the method of U.S. Patents 4,457,926 and 4,462,998, using Pt cis dach I2 or lPt trans dach I2 , respectively, as the starting materials in the following reaction sequence 1 Pt dach I2 2AgNO3 Pt dach H2O 2 NO3 2 2AgI 2 Pt dach H2O 2 NO3 2 2Na ascorbate Pt dach ascorbate The freshly prepared 0.2M solutions of the diaquo complexes eqn. 1 were mixed with 2 equivalents of ascorbic acid and 2 equivalents of NaOH. The resulting mixtures were stirred for 1 2 hours and the products were precipitated with ethanol. The crude ascorbate precipitates were collected by filtration and dried in vacuum.Alternatively crude ascorbate mixtures could be obtained by evaporating, the reaction solutions to dryness using a rotary evaporator.Preparative HPLC separation of the Pt cis dach ascorbate and Pt trans dach ascorbate mixtures The individual components of the Pt cis dach ascorbate and Pt trans dach ascorbate mixtures were separated using a Waters HPLC equipped with a WhatmanMagnum Partisil M7 ODS column 10mm X 50cm . Water was employed as the mobile phase the flow rate was 4 ml min.Detection was by UV absorbance at 254 nm. The output of this detector was connected to a Siemens Model ES 100Fraction Collector equipped with an automatic repeat injection feature. Fraction collection times were set based on the first of a series of injections the fraction collector then automatically repeated the collection sequence for as many as 15 additional injections. Each injection contained ca. 100mg of product mixture in 2ml H 20. The fractions were collected in vessels cooled with dry ice. The frozen fractions were evaporated to dryness using a lyophilizer. In addition to the materials described below, fractions containing unreacted starting material, non Pt compounds, and ascorbate degradation products were obtained. The quantities of the latter could be reduced by running the preparative reaction under an inert atmosphere. Example 3 Pt cis dach ascorbate .3HO isomers VI and VII A solution of freshly prepared Pt cis dach H2O 2 NO3 2 solution 0.2M, 50ml was treated with 3.52g of ascorbic acid ascorbic acid Pt 2.0 and 1.6g of NaOH NaOH Pt 4.0 . The resulting solution was stirred under nitrogen, at room temperature for 24 hrs. The precipitate that formed during this time was then removed by filtration, washed with water 20ml and vacuum dryed. A yield of 3.12g 58 of mixed isomers VI and VII was obtained. A 1.5g sample of the mixture was dissolved by stirring in 23 ml of ethylene glycol and filtered to remove insolubles. The filtrate was treated with 50 ml of water and cooled to 4 C for 1 hour. The resulting white solid isomer VII was collected by filtration. The filtrate was poured into 500 ml of acetone and cooled to OOC for 2 3 hours. The resulting precipitate isomer VI was then collected by filtration, washed with acetone and air dried. The separated fractions, 0.8g of isomer VII and 0.5g of isomer VI, were found to be greater than 95 pure by HPLC. Anal of isomer VI Calc. for PtC12H26N2O9 Pt, 36.30 C,26.82 H,4.88 N,15.21.

Isomer VI crystallizes in the monoclinic system space group P21 with the following cell parameters a 6.425 1 , b 20.542 2 , c 6.662 l ss 104.90 l . The measured density Pobs 2.094g cm3 of the crystals gives a calculated molecular weight of 534.9 for VI, assuming 2 molecules unit cell.The calculated molecular weight is 536.3 for Pt cis dach ascorbate . 3H2O. The structure was determined by standardPatterson and Fourier methods using 1633 unique reflections collected on a CAD 4F diffractometer with Mo 4 radiation. All calculations were performed on a DECVAX 11 780 computer using the SHELX 76 x ray programs.Refinement of the structure converged to a value of 0.020 for the discrepancy factor R1, using isotropic thermal parameters for all atoms except Pt, which was refined anisotropically. The hydrogen atoms were refined with constraints using a common temperature factor. The resulting structure clearly shows the ascorbate ligand bound to platinum through carbon C2 and oxygen 05 . 13C NMR data for Pt cis dach ascorbate .3H2O isomers VI and VII are included in Table I. 95Pt NMR data for these compounds are shown in Table II. Infrared spectra for isomers VI and VII are shown in Figures 1 and 2. These data support the conclusion that isomer VII also contains ascorbate bound through C2 and 05 and that these isomers are closely related. Both isomers are highly stable in aqueous solution. In hot water they are slowly interconverted. A mixture of isomers VI and VII also may be separated by fractional crystallization from water. The two isomers of Pt cis dach ascorbate .3H2O also can be isolated from the Pt cis dach ascorbate mixture of Example 2 by preparative HPLC. Example 4 CPt R,R trans dach ascorbatc l.3H,O and Pt S,S trans dach ascorbate O Pt R,R trans dach 12 8.00g and AgNO3 4.83 g,Ag Pt 2 were stirred in 100 ml water for 1 hr. After removal of the AgI by filtration, 2 equivalents of ascorbic acid 5.00g and 1 equivalent of NaOH 0.57g were added, the latter as a solution in 10 ml H2O. The mixture was stirred under N2 overnight. The resulting white precipitate was filtered yielding 2.65g crude product.One gram of this was recrystallized from 70 ml 25 aqueous methanol, filtering at 70 deg C and refrigerating the filtrate for 72 hr.

Pt S,S trans dach I2 5.00g and AgNO3 3.02g, Ag Pt 2.0 were stirred in 75 ml 1 water at 45 50 C for 1 hr. After cooling, the AgI was removed by filtration and 2 equivalents ascorbic acid 3.13g , and 1 equivalent NaOH 0.35g were added, the latter as a solution in 10 ml H2O.This mixture was stirred overnight under N2. It was filtered to remove a small trace of metallic impurity, then taken to dryness on a rotary evaporator, leaving a viscious amber oil. The oil was shaken in 100 ml ethanol in which it completely dissolved. This solution was added gradually to 600 ml acetone with stirring, and the mixture refrigerated overnight. The resulting white precipitate was filtered yielding 1.2g crude material containing three components. This was dissolved in 10 ml H20 and 1.2g gamma alumina added. The solution was allowed to stand over the alumina for 72 hours. When the alumina was filtered off, crystals began to form in the filtrate.After refrigeration for 1 hour the cyrstals were collected. The yield was 0.3g of Pt S,S trans dach ascor bate . Anal Calc. for PtC12H24N2O8 Pt,37.56 C,27.75 H,4.66 N,5.39. Found Pt, 37.41 C, 27.92 H,457 N,5.30. Infrared spectra of Pt R, R trans dach ascorbate and Pt S,S trans dach ascorbate appear inFigures 3 and 4. These two isomers are diastereomers, having different physical and chemical properties. Thge R,R isomer is less than 1 10 as water soluble as the S,S isomer. An attempt to prepare a mixture of these diastereomers from racemic trans dach resulted in precipitation of the R,R isomer only, with the S,S isomer remaining in solution.This affords a method of resolving racemic trans dach into its R,R and S,S forms. As with the cis dach complexes the isomers of Pt trans dach ascorbate are highly waterstable. Example 5 Pt cis dach ascorbate 2H0 A suspension of 5.63g Pt cis dach 12 and 3.36gAgNO3 in 100ml of methanol was stirred for 1.5 hours at 500C. The resulting AgI was removed by filtration and 3.52g of ascorbic acid ascorbic acid Pt 2 and 0.48g ofLiOH LiOH Pt 2 were added to the filtrate. The resulting solution was stirred for 24 hrs. at room temperature and then filtered to remove a grey white precipitate. The filtrate was evaporated to an oil and mixed with 200 ml of isopropanol. The solid that formed yield 1.5g was removed by filtration. This solid was found by HPLC to contain mostly the desired product 60 . The yield was increased to 90 using the following re precipitation procedure.A 700 mg sample of the solid was stirred in 5 ml of H2O and filtered to remove insolubles, Pt cisdach ascorbate isomers VI and VII . The filtrate was stirred with 80 ml of isopropanol and cooled to 0 C for 1 hour. The resulting precipitate was removed by filtration. This sample 200 mg was found to be 85 90 pure by HPLC. Further purification was accomplished by preparative HPLC using conditions similar to those inExample 2. Anal. Calc. for PtC18H32N2O14 Pt, 28.05 C,3l.08 H, 4.64 N, 4.03. Found Pt, 27.70 C, 30.90 H, 4.40 N, 3.99. The 13C NMR spectrum of this material is given in Figure 5. This suggests that the two ascorbate ligands are bound to Pt in a non equivalent fashion. The most likely formulation is that Pt cis dach ascorbate 21 contains both a carbon bound through C2 and an oxygen bound through 03 ascorbate ligand. The 195Pt NMR data for Pt cis dach ascorbate 2 are shown in Table II. The presence of two absorbances suggests that two distinct species are present. This requires that the two ascorbate ligands are non equivalent. The isomerism arises, as was the case with the chelated species Example 3 , from the nonequivalence of the nitrogen atoms in the Pt cis dach system. The infrared spectrum of Pt cis dach ascorbate 2 appears in Figure 6. Example 6 Pt trans dach ascorbate 2 . 2H2O Pt trans dach I2 11.26g and AgNO3 6.72g, Ag Pt 2.0 were suspended in 200 ml methanol and stirred at 55 60 C for 1.5 hours. The resulting mixture was refrigerated for 30 min, and the AgI removed by filtration. Ascorbic acid 7.04g, ascorbic acid Pt 2 was added, followed by a solution of NaOH 1.60g, NaOH Pt 2 in 30 ml of methanol. The resulting solution was stored at room temperature for 24 hours. A small quantity of dark solid was removed by filtration the solution was then taken to dryness on a rotary evaporator. The resulting oil was separated via HPLC using a WhatmanMagnum, M 7 ODS 3 50 cm. column employing repeated injections of 300 mg in 2.5 ml H20. Water was used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 4 ml min.Under these conditions the desired fraction eluted at 1300 1780 sec after injection. The fraction was frozen on collection the solid product was obtained by lyophilization. The yield was 0.52 g Anal.

Although the resulting ascorbate complexes are diastereomers owing to the chirality of ascorbate ligand, they are not resolved by HPLC on a C18 column. Example 7Cis Pt NH3 2 ascorbate . 2H2O The cis diammine analog was prepared from the reaction of cis Pt N113 2 H2O 2 NO3 2 180ml, 0.1M with 2 equivalents of ascorbic acid and 2 equivalents NaOH, as described above. After stirring for 24 hrs, under N2, the light green precipitate was removed by filtration and air dried 3.lg . The filtrate was reduced in volume to 3Oml and a second crop of product was collected by filtration.The total yield was 4.35g 54 .

Taken together, these data support ascorbate binding through C2 and 05 as is the case with Pt dach ascorbate chelates. The infrared spectrum of cis Pt NH3 2 ascorbate is given in Figure 7. Example 8 Pt cis dach isoascorbate The procedure used to prepare this analog is identical to that for Pt cis dach ascorbate isomersVI and VII given in Example 3. The yield was 3.2g 59 .The product containing two components analogous to isomersVI and VII of Pt cis dach ascorbate . Example 9 Pt trans dach tetramethylreductate 2.5H2O Pt trans dach 2I2 5.63g and AgNO3 3.40 g, Ag Pt 2.0 were stirred in 60 ml water for one hr at 550 C.After cooling for h hour, the resulting AgI was removed by filtration and to the filtrate was added solid tetramethylreductic acid 3.48 g, tmra Pt 2.0 and a solution of NaOH 0.4g, OH Pt l.0 in 10 ml of water. The resulting mixture was stirred for 3 hours and the greygreen precipitate which formed was filtered. It was dissolved in ca 200 ml methanol and filtered to remove metallic Pt. The methanol solution was then allowed to evaporate to dryness. The resulting solid was stirred with 25 ml methanol and filtered. The resulting off white solid was washed with ether and air dried.

Example 10 Pt ethylenediamine ascorbate Pt en 12 5.08 g, 10 mmoles was suspended in 75 ml water and AgNO3 3.38 g, 20 mmoles added. The mixture was warmed with stirring to 500C. for 1 hr., then cooled, with stirring, to 250C. The solid AgI was removed by filtration and washed with 25 ml water. The filtrate and washing were combined and deoxygenated by passing a stream of N2 through the solution. With the N2 flow maintained, ascorbic acid 3.52 g, 20 mmoles was added followed by a solution of NaOH 0.8 g, 20 mmoles in 6.5 ml water. The resulting solution was stoppered under N2 and stirred at room temperature for 24 hr. The precipitate which formed was filtered, and vacuum dried to constant weight. The yield was 1.75 g, 41.0 . Example 11 Pt ethylenediamine ascorbate Pt ethylenediamine ascorbate 256 mg was suspended in a solution of 256 mg of ascorbic acid in 8 ml water. The pH of the resulting mixture was adjusted to 1.5 with 1N HNO3, at which point the platinum complex dissolved. This solution was diluted serially to provide doses of 160 mg kg and below for use in activity testing.In the activity testing, the results of which are shown in Example 19, Table III, all mice were injected within 30 minutes of the preparation of the initial solution. Example 12 Acidified Pt trans R,R dach ascorbate Pt trans R,R dach ascorbate 256 mg was suspended in 8 ml water and ascorbic acid 256 mg added. To this was added 2 ml 1N HNO3, which was sufficient to dissolve the platinum complex. The resulting pH was 1.4. This solution was used in activity testing for a 640 mg kg dose.. Lower doses were obtained by serial dilution of this solution with water.

CFW mice, averaging 20 g, are immediately inspected and placed in newly prepared cages. On day zero the mice are inoculated with 0.2 ml of a freshly prepared saline suspension 0.15 M NaCl containing 1 x 107 tumor cells ml, or a total of 2 x 106 cells. This inoculum is freshly prepared using transfer mice which have been injected with tumor cells the previous week. This inoculum is the end product of a series of steps which involve 1 the removal of the cells from the peritoneal cavity of the sacrificed transfer mouse, 2 alternate centrifugation washing 2 3 times with cold saline to remove occasional blood and other undesirable components, and finally 3 dilution 1 3 of the packed cell volume with saline the final centrifugation being carried out at 1,000 rpm for 2 min .A cell count is made on a 2,000 fold dilution of this 1 3 suspension by means of aCoulter Counter. A final dilution to 1 x 10 cells ml is made based on the averaged count. On day 1, solutions of the test compounds are prepared and the mice injected, with each mouse of a set of six being injected with the same test compound at th same dose level. Also, on this day, two types of controls 6 mice set are employed 1 Normal 1 set 0.5 ml of the solvent medium used for the test compound, and 2 Positive control 1 set a known anti tumor agent cis Pt NH3 2C123 in saline at 8 mg kg , used to test the response to the biological system. The effectiveness of a compound is measured in terms of the increase in life span ILS of the test animals relative to the controls calculated from the day of tumor inoculation, day zero . In order to standardize the test data and permit intercomparisons to be made, the day of evaluation is arbitrarily taken as that day corresponding to twice the mean life span or average day of death of the normal controls. This sets a practical upper limit of 100 on the ILS attainable. For calculation purposes, survivors on the day of evaluation are considered to have died on that day. The ILS is formulated as ILS mean life span of test mice 18 x 100 mean life span of control mice 1 ILS values above 50 represent significant activity those above 75 represent excellent activity. A summary of the results is presented in TableIII. All of the materials tested met the criterion for activity 50E ILS at one or more doses .
