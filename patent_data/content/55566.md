# Ghost reduction circuit arrangement for a television receiver.

## Abstract
The output signals from the first set of delay elements 111 to 114 of n each with a first delay time τ are selectively applied to a second set of delay elements 211 to 214 of m each with a second delay time τ by means of a switch 403 . The output signals from the said first and said second of delay elements are processed by the indivisual gain controllable circuits 102 , 201 and are composed by an adder 105 , 204 . The gains a₁, a₂, ... a
