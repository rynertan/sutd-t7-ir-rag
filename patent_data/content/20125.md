## Description
POLYOLEFINS HAVING ADDITION POLYMER ADHERENT THERETO.THEIR PREPARATION AND ARTICLES COMPRISING THEM. The invention is concerned with polyolefins having polymer adherent thereto. More particularly the invention embraces articles comprising polymers bonded to polyolefin surfaces, particularly to untreated polyolefin surfaces and most particularly to the difficult to wet untreated polypropylene surfaces. These polymers comprise mer units having comparatively non polar and non polarizable groups, other than small groups, extending from the polymer backbone. In various embodiments the adherent vinyl polymers, or bonded polymers, form adhesive coats, tiecoats, topcoats or as components of these.Articles exemplifying embodiments of this invention include nonwoven fabrics, woven fabrics and flocked fabrics, all comprising polyolefins and the adherent polymers laminates of polyolefins and other materials and decorated polyolefins in which the pigment, dye or other decoration is bonded by the adherent polymer. Polyolefins, particularly polypropylene, have inert surfaces to which other materials cannot be readily bonded.Various surface treatments such as flame oxidation, corona discharge and chemical etching have been used to activate these surfaces with some measure of success. It is known to employ certain, relatively expensive, chlorinated polymers as primers to enhance the bonding of materials to untreated polyolefin surfaces. It may be speculated that thespolymers are actually a form of chemical etching by means of their slow release of strong acid or strongly oxidizing materials. Chlorinated mixtures of a hydrocarbon resin and polyethylene are taught for use as primers and paint and ink additives for improving adhesion of coatings to polyolefin, by Etter in US patent 4,070,421. Chlorinating carboxyl group containing polyolefins to form primer coatings for untreated polyolefin substrates is taught in US patent 3,579,485. Menikheim et al., in US patent 3,380,844 teach the coating of polyolefin film by a polymer of vinylidene chloride, a meth acrylate ester and meth acrylic or itaconic acid.The polymers are recited as having no strippable adhesion to polyolefin substrates. Acrylic esters having alkyl groups containing more than two carbon atoms were found to be not entirely satisfactory in these polymers. Polymers other than chlorinated polymers have also been adhered to polyolefins. Agouri et al. teach a process for chemical modification of polyolefins by grafting polar monomers onto the polyolefin by means of a free radical generating material, in US patent14,080,405, to produce a polyolefin surface having improved wettability. MacArthur, in US patent 3,394,029, teaches the coating of polyolefin surfaces by solution polymers of certain terpene acrylates and N terpene acrylamides for improved adhesion of conventional lacquer topcoats. Chancler et al., in US patent 4,014,645, teach the enhancement of dye receptivity of polyolefin materials used in fabric manufacture by coating the polyolefin with a self curing polymeric binder containing a quaternary ammonium salt.Emmons et al., inUS patent 4,097,677, disclose certain radiation curable coatings, useful to coat some poly,olefins the coatings comprising monomeric uWsaturated esters of glycol monodicyclopentenyl ethers. In.Bri tish patent 1,177,199, there is disclosed nonwoven webs containing a major amount of polypropylene fiDers bonded with a binder comprising vinyl acetate, ethylene and an unsaturated N methylol amide or an alkyl ether thereof. It is pointed out that as is well known, it is extraordinarily difficult to bond polypropylene to itself or to other materials. page 1, line 53 .Robinson et al., in US patent 3,241,662, teach the preparation of a roll of biaxially oriented polypropylene film having an activated surface and adherent to the activated surface a pressure sensitive adhesive which does not adhere to the untreated surface. The polymer is a polymer of about 55 to 95 of an alkyl ester of acrylic or methacrylic acid with the alkyl group preferably having 6 to 12 carbon atoms, up to 12 of an unsaturated carboxylic acid or unsaturated aliphatic amide and various other comonomers. Cantor et al., in US patent 3,258,443, describe a latex which may be used to deposit a pressure sensitive adhesive on polyethylene and polypropylene.The latex is prepared from 1 to 45 vinyl acetate, 50 to 98 of an alkyl acrylate having an alkyl group of between 4 and 10 carbon atoms several acyclic alkyl groups are named and 1 to .5 of an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The alkyl group containing 4 to 10 carbon atoms preferably contains at least 6 straight chain carbon atoms and most preferably is the 2 ethylhexyl group. James et al., in US patent 3,519,531, disclose certain copolymers of ethylene and vinyl esters of alkenolic acids and alkyl esters of acrylic or substituted acrylic acid, for coating polypropylene film Taft et al., in US patent 3,887,738, teach hot melt compositions comprising a copolymer of ethylene and vinyl acetate and or alkyl acrylate useful as an adhesive for the back sizing of tufted carpets which may comprise polypropylene backing materials.Two patents toBaatz et al., US patents 3,931,087 and 4,012,560 teach the use of copolymers of a sulfonic acid and esters of acrylic or methacrylic acids as pressure sensitive adhesives which are adherent to a number of surfaces including polyethylene and polypropylene. Peterson, in U.S. Patent 3,524,795, teaches layered barrier packaging films employing polyolefin outer layers and a gas barrier inner layer bonded together by adhesives such as chlorinated polyethylene, a copolymer of ethylene and vinyl acetate, and copolymers of ethylene and certain lower acrylates. We have now found that certain polymers are surprisingly adherent to polyolefin surfaces, especially untreated polyolefin surfaces and more particularly untreated polypropylene surfaces.Untreated polyolefins, i.e. those whose surface has not been treated to enhance bonding thereto , particularly untreated polypropylene, have not been commercially employed to the extent desired because of the difficulty in finding adhesive compositions suitable for coating or adhering other materials to such polyolefins. In this invention certain vinyl addition latex polymers may give adhesion to untreated polypropylene which is unexpectedly superior to that of corresponding solution polymers. The latex systems are also easier to handle during processing steps and far more desirable because of the absence of solvents. Solvents require attention to pollution control which is becoming more costly. According to the invention there is provided a polyolefin substrate having adherent thereto final addition polymer more particularly described below. The polyolefin substrate is preferably untreated and more preferably untreated polypropylene. The substrate may be in any of the various forms in which the polyolefins are commonly used such as bulk articles, thick sheets, thin films, slit films, woven slit films, fibers, cut fibers, yarn and the like. The vinyl addition polymer is a polymer of monomers, comprising preferably, at least 5 by weight of, at least one primary monomer of the formula EMI5.1 where is H or methyl, and B is H or methyl, and R is CH2, CH CH3 or C CH3 2.The polymer has surface energy properties such as to form a stable bond with the polyolefin substrate. In more quantitative terms, it is preferable that the total surface energy of the polymer be between about 22 and 42 dynes centimeter said energy having a nonpolar dispersive component between about 20 and about 38 dynes centimeter and a polar component up to about 15 dynes centimeter with said polar component being not over about 38 of the total surface energy.It is further preferred that the polymer have an average solubility more than 0.25 gm. per 100 ml. in the low solubility parameter solvents isooctane, n pentane, l hexene, diisobutylene, and cyclohexane.Preferably the polymer is a latex polymer. This invention embraces articles comprising a polyolefin and the adherent vinyl addition polymer.The polyolefin may be a rigid substrate, such as a printed or decorated polyolefin in which the vinyl addition polymer is employed in the paint or decorative coating, or as a tiecoat between the decoration or coat and the polyolefin, or as an adhesive such as for bonding a textile fabric to the polyolefin. The coating may have other purposes in addition to or other than decoration. Examples are polyurethane or polyester foams or polyvinyl chloride films adhered to the polyolefin. Such other purposes include protection of the polyolefin, furnishing an article with additional properties such as cushioning, barrier or non skid properties etc. Other embodiments include flock coated polyolefin.Among the uses of the vinyl addition polymers on flexible polyolefin surfaces are laminations, including lamination of textile fabrics and flocked materials and thin films such as polyvinyl chloride film. A further example of the use of the vinyl addition polymer is to serve as a dyeable coating for polypropylene such as polypropylene fabric, fabric containing polypropylene flock and polypropylene plastic materials. The adherent vinyl addition polymers, alternatively described as vinyl addition polymeric adhesives, range from materials having a low glass transition temperature Tg , and soft and sticky, to those with a comparatively high Tg and hard and tough or brittle as desired and obtainable by compositional and molecular weight variation. This invention also relates to processes for preparing the invented articles. The polyolefins which are the substrates of this invention comprise in particular olefin polymers, especially polymers of olefines containing 2 to 8, and preferably 2 to 5 and most preferably 3 carbon atoms.The polyolefins include, without being limited thereto, polyethylene, polypropylene, polybutenes, polypentenes, and copolymers of these with small amounts of other monomers with which they are copolymerizable.Included are such copolymers containing at least 85 by weight of olefin units, as defined by theTextile Fiber Products Identification Act PublicLaw 85 897 . Such polyolefins may be in the form of fibers, granules, films, woven forms and nonwoven forms, such as woven slit film and spun bonded polyolefins, polyolefin tape, sheet and block.The polyolefins may be heat set or molded forms.Included are oriented, including biaxially oriented, polyolefin films especially oriented polypropylene films. Of greatest importance is the group of polyolefins known as untreated polyolefins and particularly untreated polypropylene . As has been recited above, untreated polyolefin surfaces are difficult to bond as well as to wet. The difficulty is often ascribed to the non polar and hydrophobic nature of the purely hydrocarbon surface present on these materials. Polypropylene has been singled out as being especially difficult and it has been suggested that the reason for the particular difficulty in bonding to untreated polypropylene is that the surface consists essentially of methyl groups. The vinyl addition polymers of this invention adhere to these difficult to wet and difficult to bond surfaces. The preferred primary monomers of this invention are isobornyl acrylate and or isobornyl methacrylate particularly the harder isobornyl methacrylate. In one embodiment the polymer comprises less than 20 by weight of primary monomer units. The, up to 95 by weight, comonomers in the adherent polymer may be any of the well known unsaturated addition polymerizable vinyl monomers. The adherent polymer may be prepared by any of the well known methods of free radical emulsion or latex polymerization. It is known to control the molecular weight of the produced polymer by means such as polymerization temperature, initiator concentration and mode of addition, and chain transfer agent concentration and mode of addition. For good flow of the neat polymer and low extensibility, i.e. little leggyness of the adhesive polymer comparatively low molecular weight material, such as up to 300,000 is preferred.For greater toughness emulsion polymerization, used in the absence of molecular weight limiting components, yields molecular weights above 300,000 with values of two million being achievable. Still higher molecular weights and insolubility of the polymer are obtained by employing crosslinking monomers among the monomers in the polymer. Crosslinking normally results in improved resistance to solvents, such as drycleaning solvents, in improved resistance to chemical attack, such as by aqueous detergents in washing, and in improved thermal stability and in resistance to polymer creep.Addition crosslinking monomers are polyethylenically unsaturated copolymerizable monomers, such as divinylbenzene, diallyl maleate, diallylphthalate, ethylene glycol diacrylate or dimethacrylate, glycerol triacrylate and so forth. A more preferred way of producing crosslinked polymers in this invention is to prepare the polymer in a crosslinkable form and then in a separate step, ordinarily after application to the substrate, achieve crosslinking by a subsequent chemical reaction such as a further addition reaction or a condensation reaction. The further reaction can occur between functional groups already present in the mer units of the polymer chain or by reaction of functional groups on the polymer chain with an external crosslinker.The cross linking reaction may be initiated by free radical initiators, by thermal activation, by radiation, by loss of water or other small molecules as in a condensation reaction, by pickup of water from the atmosphere, etc. The various reactions may be accelerated by heat or radiant energy such as ultraviolet radiation or electron beam curing as is well known in the art. A wide variety of functional groups is useful for producing crosslinking particularly with an external crosslinking agent. Such groups may be present at levels up to about 20 although 0.02 to 10 is preferred and 0.1 to 3 is most preferred. Mer units comprising pendant amido groups, including alkylamido, alkoxyamido and alkoxyalkylamido both mono and di in each case are useful. Examples of such groups are acrylamido, methacrylamido, methoxymethylacrylamido, butoxymethylmethacrylamido, methylacrylamido and so forth. These groups are crosslinkable with external aminoplasts as well as internally with each other employing well known aminoplast chemistry.The reactions are normally enhanced by the use of acid catalysis which may include catalysis by acid groups on the polymer itself.The groups may be crosslinked by epoxy crosslinkers, normally used as external crosslinkers and again acid catalysis may be employed.Polycarboxylic molecules and polyhydroxyl molecules, small molecules or polymeric molecules, are also useful as crosslinkers for the amido groups and are also catalyzed by acids. The hydroxyl groups, carboxyl groups or epoxy groups may alternatively be on the polymer and be cross linked by other mer units on the polymer or external crosslinking agents. Mercapto groups may be substituted for hydroxyl groups in the crosslinking systems. Preferably, polymer hydroxyl groups are crosslinked by external aminoplasts using acid catalysis. Polymer carboxyl groups are readily crosslinked by external epoxy groups and in this case base catalysis, such as by the use of simple amines, for example triethanol amine or henzyl dimethylamine, can be used. Epoxy groups in the polymer are preferably crosslinked by polycarboxylic compounds and catalyzed either by acids or bases which may be either internal in the polymer or external.An example of an internal base is a mer unit derivable from an amine monomer such as dimethylaminoethylmethacrylate or a quaternary ammonium monomer. More specifically the coating may be thermosetting, i.e., be subject to latent crosslinking.Such polymers are made with monomers which contain reactive groups capable of reacting with themselves or with other groups present in the polymer chain to impart crosslinking during heating or fusion of the coating.Where addition polymers are involved, monomers which are suitable for this function include certain acrylics having crosslinkable functionality exemplified by the following acrylic acid methacrylic acid acrylamide methacrylamide epoxyalkyl acrylates or methacrylates, e.g , glycidyl methacrylate monoacrylic acid esters of glycols hydroxyalkyl acrylates or methacrylates, isocyanatoalkyl acrylates and aminoalkyl acrylates or methacrylates, as well as other compounds described below. Examples of the latent crosslinking reactions which are possible using heat and or catalysis are EMI11.1 EMI12.1 Addition polymerizable unsaturated monomers containing such groups are well known in the art. Functional monomers of use are disclosed in U.S. patent nos.3,446,777 to W. D. Emmons, 3,150,118 to D. H. Clemens and 3,266,930 to W. D. Emmons and E. Hankins Owens, all incorporated herein by reference. A preferred crosslinking system employs the unsaturated quaternary ammonium monomers of S.N. Lewis et al. taught in U.S. patent 3,678,098, incorporated herein by reference. A particular advantage of theLewis et al. crosslinking system is the ability to crosslink at temperatures below the distortion temperature of the pblyolefin. Another advantage of theLewis et al. crosslinking system is, due to its being a quaternary ammonium system and thus cationic, that it is particularly dyeable by dyes such as acid dyes, metallized dyes and direct dyes. Other thermosetting systems can be used, such as the aminoplast modified alkyds described in U.S. patent no. 2,648,642 toSpencer, and the aminoplast modified acrylics described in U.S. patent nos. 2,978,433 to Hurwitz, 3,082,184 toFalgiatore et al., 3,183,282 to Hurwitz, and 3,235,622 to Clemens et al.Formulation with external crosslinkers has long been conventional in the art thus the procedures and ratios are well known. Another preferred crosslinking system employs antoxidizable groups such as dicyclopentenyl groups.Such groups can be incorporated into the polymer by means of monomers such as dicyclopentenyl oxyacrylate or methacrylate and DCPQEMA and DCPOEA identified hereinbelow. When less than 25 , for example about 5 and about 25 , by weight, of the primary monomers are employed, it is pre ferred that the average solubility parameter, averaged by weight percent, of the supplementary monomers be 8 8.or less in the 25 to 50 range of the primary monomers it is preferred that the supplementary monomers have an average solubility parameter of less thrn 9,2 When greater than about 50 of the primary. monmere is utilized in the copolymer any other copolymerizable monomers are employed.

L. Hoy Journal of Paint Technology, Vol 42 pp 76 118 1970 others are from H. Burrell, supra. The term vinyl monomer as used herein means a monomer comprising at least one of the groups vinylidene, vinyl or vinylidene. The preparation of these polymers is taught in several of the examples as well as in standard texts on the subject such as Polymer Processes by Schildknecht,Interscience, New York 1956 and Emulsion Polymerization by Blackley, Wiley, New York 1975 . Mixtures of the vinyl polymers prepared by different methods or by the same method are also useful in this invention. In addition to the surface energetics required for good adhesion to polyolefins, for specific uses a given hardness or softing temperature is desirable.The desired hardness or softing temperate is obtained by copolymerizing harder or softer monomers with the primary vinyl addition monomers to achieve the desired hardness or softing range. This is controlled by the glass transition temperature, Tg, of the copolymer. To increase hardness and to raise the softening temperature comonomers are used whose homopolymer Tg is greater than that of theprimary vinyl monomer. Tg is a conventional criterion of polymer hardness described in Principles of Polymer Chemistry by Flory, see especially pages 56 and 57, CornellUniversity Press 1953 . Lists of Tg of high molecular weight homopolymers are widely available such as in Polymer Handbook , supra, Section III. Measurements of Tg may be made on polymers samples. Tg may be calculated for copolymers as described by Fox, Bull.Am. Physics Soc. 1,3,p. 123 1956 . To form a stable bond with a polyolefin substrate the adherent vinyl addition polymer must have the appropriate surface energy properties. It is believed, these properties are necessary to form an intimate bond between the polymer and the polyolefin as well as to prevent the intrusion or to promote the elimination of foreign liquids and gases from the microscopic and submicroscopic interstices on the surface of the polyolefin. Such foreign material would be a barrier to the intimate contact between polymer and polyolefin.Although we do not wish to be bound by any specific theory of operation of adhesive forces, it appears that high adhesion is obtained by both high intimacy of contact, due to exclusion of air or foreign liquids from the interface, and high bonding forces across the interface between the polyolefin and the adherent vinyl addition polymer. These effects are achieved in a balanced manner when the surface energy properties of the vinyl addition polymer are appropriate. The surface energy properties of the adherent vinyl addition polymer are determined by placing a drop of water and separately a drop of methylene iodide on a plane surface of the adherent polymer and determining the angle of contact between the liquid, water in the one case and methylene iodide in the other, and the polymer at the edge of the drop.From these two data there is calculated, the total surface energy of the adherent polymer and the non polar dispersive component and polar component of this energy these being the only two components the sum is the total surface energy. It is preferred that the total surface energy be between about 22 and about 42 dynes per centimeter, having a non polar dispersive component between about 20 and about 38 dynes per centimeter and a polar component up to about 15 dynes per centimeter. In general it is preferred that the polar component be not over about 38 of the total surface energy. An even more preferable range for the total surface energy is from about 26 to about 39 dynes per centimeter with a non polar component being between about 22 and about 36 dynes per centimeter and the polar component being up to about 14 dynes per centimeter. Additionally it is found desirable that the solubility of the adherent vinyl addition polymer in certain low solubility parameter solvents, i.e., isooctane, n pentane, 1 hexene, diisobutylene and cyclohexane, average 0.25 gm per 100 ml or greater. It is preferable that the average solubility in these solvents be over 0.35 gm 100 ml and even more preferable that it be over 0.50 gm 100 ml. A stable bond between the polyolefin and the adherent vinyl addition polymer is demonstrable by a peel adhesion test. Using the 1800 adhesion peel strength tests described below, employing a 30 cm per minute crosshead speed , with untreated polypropylene sheet as the substrate, a value greater than 17.8 kgm 1 one lb. per inch may indicate a stable bond. Preferably the bond stability is such that the 1800 peel strength at 30 cm per minute is greater than 35.7 kgm 1 two Ibs. per inch and most preferably greater than 71.4 kgm 1 four lbs. per inch or even 89.3 kgm 1 five lbs. per inch .Ordinarily the test is performed at room temperature but in the case of a polymer having a Tg above zero degrees C the 1800 peel strength measurement is made at a temperature 20 degrees C above the Tg. When a cohesive failure is observed the temperature at which the test is performed is lowered until an adhesive failure to the polypropylene is observed or the Tg of the polymer is reached. Measurement at low temperatures is often required for adherent polymers having low Tg, such as below 20 C. A particularly useful embodiment of this invention comprises a blend of a latex of the adherent vinyl polymer of this invention and another latex.Preferably, the adherent polymer comprises at least 2 of the polymer solids of the blend, more preferably it is 10 to 60 and most preferably 20 to 40 of the latex polymer solids. It is also preferred that the blend have the total surface energy and surface energy component values such as to form a stable bond with the polyolefin. In blends with other polymers, particularly other polymer emulsions, the other component will ordinarily contain mer units useful for embracing additional desirable properties, such as dyeability, crosslinking, softness or hardness etc. The adherent vinyl addition polymer in a latex can be used as is or formulated with other ingredients customary to achieve given application or end use properties. Thickener is used, the amount being adjusted in a convenient manner to achieve the consistency suitable for application by the particular technique employed. Normally, the pH of aqueous compositions is adjusted in achieving the desired consistency. Another desirable ancillary component is a volatile water soluble organic antifreeze agent. Ethylene glycol and other glycols and polyglycols are especially useful for this purpose at concentrations up to about 5 by weight of the total composition. Additional stabilizing surfactants generally added at about 0.1 to about 5 may be desirable to achieve added stability. Systems containing surfactants often require the addition of antifoam agents to minimize foaming.Such agents are well known and include high boiling alcohols, polyglycols and silicone liquids.If long term stability is desired, preservative or fungicidal agents can be used in their usual small effective proportions. Particularly with the higher glass temperature compositions of this invention, plasticizers, when added in minor proportions up to 20 by weight of the polymer, are effective. Other auxiliary materials that may be used include dispersing agents for dispersing and maintaining in a finely divided state tinting colors, sequestering agents for controlling polyvalent metal ions, humectants, such as water soluble gums and salts of polyacrylic acid and glycols and polyglycols, bactericides and fungicides, perfumes and masking agents, corrosion inhibiting agents and so forth. Another group of auxiliary materials are ultraviolet light adsorbers, particularly for color and polymer stabilization.All of these are generally present at less than 8 , most commonly less than 4 . In further aspects this invention embraces processes for preparing the polymer coated polyolefin substrates. One process comprises applying a liquid or foam composition comprising said vinyl addition polymer to the untreated polyolefin substrate and curing and or drying the polymer or allowing it to dry and or cure. The process may include the step of applying a coating, preferably of polymer different from the adherent polymer, to said adherent polymer. In another embodiment the process may include the step of applying fibre floc to the adherent polymer. Various methods of assembling the coated substrate are available. The adherent polymer may be cured or dried before application to the polyolefin. Alternatively, or additionally the adherent polymer may be applied to another substrate which may or may not be polyolefin and a polyolefin substrate applied to the polymer. The invention also includes articles comprising the polyolefin substrate having the vinyl addition polymer adherent thereto.Preferably such articles include non woven fabrics, flocked materials, laminates with one or more layers of additional polyolefin and or different polymers and top coated or otherwise decorated materials. One embodiment of this invention relates to nonwoven webs, such as in the form of carpets, containing polyolefin fibers and a binder comprising the adhesive vinyl addition polymer described above.It is well known that it is extraordinarily difficult to bond polyolefins particularly polypropylene and this is especially evident in nonwoven carpet web bonding because of the comparatively small surface area of the fiber available for bonding. Nonwoven web containing a major amount of polypropylene fibers, including those which consist essentially or entirely of polypropylene fibers, and bonded by the polymer of this invention are unexpectedly strong and thus useful in many industrial carpets as well as home carpet applications. These carpets are particularly suitable for indoor outdoor carpeting where stability of the adherent polymer to temperature extremes as well as light, moisture and various other weathering stresses is desired. The fibers in the nonwoven web may be ordered or haphazardly distributed.The mat may be formed by carding when the fibers are of such character, by virtue of length and flexibility, as to be amenable to the carding procedure. The fibers need not be exclusively polyolefin and may comprise natural textile fibers such as hemp or cotton, as well as artificial organic textile fibers or filaments including rayon, cellulose esters, vinyl resin fibers, condensation polymer fibers including polyamides and polyesters and the like. The web may be a result of a single card or it may be desirable to superpose plurality of such single card webs to build a mat of greater thickness for a given end use. In such a built up mat different layers may be disposed at different angles with respect to their fiber orientations so as to give greater strength to the built up web.The length of the fibers is usually at least about 2 centimeters with lengths about 4 centimeters being preferred although ones as short as one centimeter and longer than 5 centimeters are useful in some instances. A wide range of fiber deniers is useful with the range of 1 3 denier being preferred. Polyethylene fibers include the conventional low density monofilament fibers typically having a density in the neighborhood of 0.92 grams per cc and having a break tenacity of the order of 1 to 3 grams per denier. This material begins to soften at about 105 to 1150C and exhibits melting in the neighborhood of 110 to 125 C it begins to exhibit 5 to 8 shrinkage in the neighborhood of 75 to 80 C and 50 to 60 shrinkage at about 100 C. Another polyethylene useful for fibers is monofilament linear high density polyethylene, also available as a flat fiber, having a break strength in the neighborhood of 3.5 to 7 grams per denier, a softening region of 115 to 125 0C and a melt region in the neighborhood of 125 to 1400C it exhibits only about 3 to 5 shrinkageinthe neighborhood of 70 750C and about 8 to 12 . shrinkage at 1000C. The polypropylene fibers of this invention are commonly available as staple, monofilament and multifilament fibers which are generally isotactic. They have a density in the neighborhood of 0.95 to 0.96 grams per cc. The staple and tow have a breaking tenacity in the neighborhood of 3 to 6.5 grams per denier and a density about 0.90 to 0.91 grams per cc the monofilament has a breaking tenacity slightly greater being about 3.5 to about 7 grams per denier and the same density the multifilament material covers a wide range of strengths from about 2.5 to about 8 grams per denier and has the same density as the others.These polypropylene fibers generally soften in the range from 1400C to 165 0C and typically melt in the region 1600C to 1800C and have up to about 5 shrinkage at 1000C and typically 5 to 12 shrinkage at 1300C. Because of the shrinkage of the polyolefin fibers at high temperatures, as mentioned above, drying and curing steps, employed in the adhesion of other materials to the polyolefins or with regard to adhesives used to bond polyolefins, are limited in, temperature. Normally temperatures below 1000C or 1100C are preferred although temperatures up to 1500C, and perhaps a bit higher in some instances, may be employed with the more thermally stable of these fibers or for heat setting. The polymers of the instant invention form stable bonds to the polyolefins when dried and, if desired, further cured.Although I do not wish to be bound by any theory of operation of these adherent or adhesive polymers, it is believed that this result is associated with the particular surface energetic properties of the adhesive polymers of this invention. The strength of the bond produced between the adhesive polymer and the polyolefin especially the untreated polyolefin particularly polypropylene is high even after air drying under ambient conditions. More often it is desirable to dry at elevated temperatures such as temperatures up to 1000C. For systems containing crosslinkers, catalysts may be present and these and even higher temperatures are often preferred.The higher temperatures and sometimes additional curing time is used in the cross linking of polymers of this invention which by virtue of their containing self crosslinking or crosslinkable mer units in the polymer are tailored to produce finished products in which the adhesive polymer is crosslinked. The crosslinking plus the pecularily good wetting of the fibers by the adhesive polymer, which, having the appropriate surface energy properties and solubility in low solubility parameter solvents spreads on the fibers and wets them so as to interlock the fibers, thus develop a strong fabric of bound fibers. Nonwoven fabrics of the type described herein may be used in sanitary and health care fabric products, such as diapers, sanitary napkins, hospital drapes, disposable sheets and bedpads, as fiberfill, as garment linings, in simulated leather substrates and the like. A further embodiment provides flocked materials comprising the substrates of the invention. Flocking is a process by which textile fibers are embedded into an adhesive on a substrate producing an article which normally has a velvet or suede like hand or feel.Polyolefins may be used as the fibers embedded and may also be used as the substrate in either use the polyolefin is the substrate of the instant invention.The fiocking process is carried out by passing a substrate, coated or printed with a composition comprising the adhesive polymer, through an electrical field in which short fibers are electrostatically directed and oriented into the adhesive. In another technique, a beater bar orients and embeds the fibers by means of vibration. Still other techniques combine both the electrostatic field and a beater bar presumably yielding optimum flock orientation and density. Using the adhesive polymer of this invention flock fabrics having a soft hand and great durability are readily achieved particularly when employing crosslinkable adhesive polymers including both self crosslinking systems and externally crosslinked systems with polymers having reactive functional mer units.These systems, both crosslinked and uncrosslinked, are made with appropriate degrees of durability to washing and drycleaning, atmospheric oxidation and ultraviolet and heat degredation and creep at elevated temperatures appropriate to the intended end use. Excellent color retention and ease of dyeing are further advantages imparted by the adhesive polymer of this invention having quaternary ammonium mer units, e.g. those of Lewis et al., supra. The emulsion form of the polymers is particularly attractive in the safe handling of aqueous systems, ease of cleanup, when the properties associated with high molecular weight are desired, and ease of blending with other polymer emulsion, etc.For example the dyable quaternary ammonium mer units may be in a blend latex so the combined blend exhibits the stable bond to the polyolefin and the excellent dyeability. Another embodiment provides backcoated fabrics comprising the substrates of the invention. In the manufacture of tufted carpets the adhesive polymer or blends comprising the polymer are used for the primary backing, for tuftlock, for adhesion of a secondary backing, or for adhesion of a foam backing serving as an integral cushion for the carpet. Other examples of backcoated fabrics are imitation fur and pile fabrics wherein the adhesive polymer serves to lock the tuft and pile and to produce an article of excellent hand and durability. Mattress ticking fabrics are backcoated to produce a fabric of improved hand, integrity, handleability, printability and abrasion resistance of the face of the fabric.Among the advantages in backcoating an uphostery fabric with the adhesive polymer of the instant invention is the improvement in hand, durability and abrasion resistance of the face of the fabric.Polyolefin films and woven or nonwoven fabrics are used as these backing materials. It is estimated that 65 of the primary backings used in tufted carpets are slit woven polypropylene, 20 are spun bonded polypropylene nonwovens and only 15 are jute.At present, almost all secondary carpet backing is jute which both costs more and has many undesirable properties as compared with the polyolefin materials.However, despite their many advantages, the polyolefin backing materials are notoriously resistant to dyeing. Surface coverings incorporating such backings exhibit grin through , the undesirable visibility of the polyolefin backing when the tufted surface covering is creased or bent back upon itself. Grinthrough is especially pronounced in shag carpeting when there is a mismatch between coloration of the backing and the face yarns. Thus the combination of the adhesive binder of the instant invention having quaternary ammonium mer units, as described above, and polyolefin backing material produces superior binding qualities and improved dye receptivity. When the coated polyolefin backing is dyed, the backing as well as the face yarn tufted into the backing is tightly locked into a unitary whole and the polyolefin backing material will be masked from view. Because of the feasibility of getting excellent bonding by means of low temperature drying, improved drying efficiency and economy of operation are possible without sacrifice in performance.In addition to providing excellent adhesion to the polyolefin, the adhesive polymers of this invention having quaternary ammonium mer units provide excellent dye pickup which is controllable so that the polyolefin backing material may be dyed on shade with the face yarns thereby producing a uniform appearance while also masking any unsightly appearing backings. Any form of polyolefin substrate material which can be tufted to form a surface covering can be used, including films and various woven and nonwoven forms, such as woven slit film and spun bonded polyolefins. The polyolefins include any such materials used as surface covering backings, such as polyethylene, polyolefins containing two to six carbon atoms, wherein such copolymers contain at least 85 by weight of such olefin units, as defined by theTextile Fiber Products Identification Act Public Law 85 897 . Woven slit films or spun bonded films of polypropylene are preferred. The face yarns may be any type of yarn conventionally used in the tufting of polyolefin substrates to form surface coverings, such as nylons, acrylics, polyesters and other synthetic yarns including blends of snythetic alone or with natural fibers. When the adherent polymer comprises quaternary ammonium mer units any dyes of the direct and acid dye classes, such as the sulfonated dyes, may be used for the dyeing. The polyolefin backing material may be dyed separately from the face yarns or, more usually, the face yarns and polyolefin substrate will be dyed simultaneously after the coating and tufting steps. The dye levels are those conventionally employed in the dyeing of polyolefin surface coverings, and any dyeing technique may be used including Kuster dyeing, beck dyeing and printing techniques.The polymeric coating is applied at least to that side of the polyolefin substrate from which the face yarns will project after tufting, but it has also been found useful to back coat the polyolefin substrate before or after tufting to more tightly lock in the face yarns to the substrate and, in the case of woven or nonwoven backings, to also stabilize the backing material against distortion and fraying. If a secondary backing material is used, it also may be coated and dyed in accordance with the invention, if desired. One of the outstanding advantages of the invention is that no separate curing step is required to achieve resistance to a dye cycle. The polymeric coatings are self curing upon elimination of water, which elimination can be effected by permitting the coated substrate to dry under ambient room conditions or the curing can be accelerated by conventional drying techniques. The high temperature levels usually required for curing of other polymeric binders can be avoided and therefore the problem of possible damage to the substrate when, for example, the temperature approaches the melting point of the polyolefin material. It has been found, further, that the good substrate masking properties achieved by the improved dyeability permit reduction in face yarn density and high speed dyeing with different colors. In the past, masking of the substrate has required high surface yarn density or the needlepunching of another yarn layer into the backing. The expense of such approaches can now be avoided. The invention thus opens up polyolefin backings to use in tufted upholstery fabrics since, heretofore, primary backings for such uses have been limited to backings of rayon or other fibers which accept dyes naturally. In one embodiment of this invention the adhesive latex polymers of this invention, or compositions comprising them, serve to bond a polyolefin substrate to another substrate, comprising a bulk object, a sheet or a film. Useful objects are obtained by incorporating the properties of the second sheet or film with a polyolefin film in such way as to produce a laminate having the desirable features of both.For example, the vapor or moisture barrier characteristics or the sunlight protection characteristics may be improved by the other film while the polyolefin serves to improve the slip, strength or coefficient bf friction haracteristics as its contribution to the properties of the laminate. Thus, a laminate can be made which is more heat sensitive than the polypropylene in order to improve film heat sealability at a relatively low temperature or to produce a coating which is readily painted, lacquered, printed or decorated in some other manner. Of course, the adhesive polymer of the instant invention may produce these latter properties without the necessity of a second film however, in some cases the fabricator may prefer the second film approach for other reasons. The articles of this invention can be prepared by coating one surface of a polyolefin substrate, such as a film, with the adhesive polymer of the instant invention.The coating can be accomplished by a simple operation in which a latex of the copolymer is applied to the film by spraying, brushing, rolling, dipping, or similar technique.Thereafter, the water is removed by evaporation leaving an adherent layer of the copolymer. The thickness of the adherent layer of copolymer is not critical, but for optimum results should be from about 0.02 to about 3.0 mils. Alternatively the adhesive polymer may be applied to the other substrate or to both the other and the polyolefin substrate. The last of these is exemplified by the application of the adhesive polymer in the nip formed between the two substrates, such as between moving films each being carried by suitable rollers. In each case the polyolefin and other substrate are firmly joined by the adhesive polymer between them. Of course, both substrates may be polyolefin. The composition of the adhesive polymer or, if used in a blend, the blend can be adjusted to provide good adhesion to the non olefinic surface in cases in which the laminate comprises such surface. For example, if the other surface is of higher energy or is more polar, the adhesive polymer or blend is modified in these directions while remaining within the limits required for stable bonding to the polyolefin, Suitable materials which can be used as the other film in accordance with the present invention to produce laminated articles are thermoplatic film forming polymers and include a second polyolefin film of, for example, the hydrocarbon polymers such as polyethylene both low and high density , poly butene l , polypropylene, mixtures of polyethylene and polypropylene, and mixtures of polypropylene and polybutylene and other films such as poly vinyl acetate poly vinyl chloride poly vinylidene chloride vinyl chloride vinyl acetate interpolymers vinyl chloride vinylidene chloride interpolymers copolmers of vinylidene chloride with, for example, acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile the alkyl, aryl, alkaryl, aralkyl or cycloalkyl acrylates or methacrylates the alkoxy alkyl acrylates or methacrylates the haloalkyl acrylates or methacrylates, alkyloc halo acrylates methyl isopropenyl ketone and methyl vinyl ether poly vinyl propionate poly vinyl chloroacetate poly vinyl naphthalene poly ethyl vinyl ether polyesters such as poly ethylene terephthalate and copolyesters of ethylene terephthalate and ethylene isophthalate polyamides such as poly hexamethylene adipamide , poly hexamethylene sebacamide , polycaproamide, N methoxymethyl poly hexamethylene adipamide , polyacrylamide, polymethacrylamide and poly N vinyl succinimide poly vinyl acetals such as poly vinyl butyral poly vinyl fluoride poly vinylidene fluoride vinyl fluoride vinylidene fluoride interpolymers poly chlorotrifluoroethylene poly tetrafluoroethylene interpolymers of tetrafluoroethylene with hexafluoropropylene vinylfluoride tetrafluoroethylene interpolymers vinylidene fluoride hexafluoroethylene interpolymers poly oxymethylene , poly acrylonitrile poly vinyl pyridine polymers of allyl glycidyl ether cellophane cellulose esters such as cellulose acetate and cellulose nitrate rubber hydrochloride, and the like and even stereoregular polypropylene itself. Particularly desirable films are those with low gas and moisture vapor transmission characteristics.These barrier layer materials are applied to the adhesion polymer surface coating on the polyolefin and they are exemplified by vinylidene chloride polymers, vinyl chloride polymers, vinylidene fluoride polymers and copolymers of these with other materials usually being at least 70 weight percent of these or a combination of the monomers corresponding to these homopolymers. The vinyl halide polymers may include light stabilizers, plasticizers, heat stabilizers and other additives well known in the art and generally found advantageous in such films. A further embodiment provides substrates bearing the adherent polymer applied as a fluid coating.Decorative ink and paint coatings of the types well known in these art fields are adherent to polyolefins when the polyolefin has a surface coating comprising the adherent polymer of this invention. In the same way complete or partial layers of other films can be applied onto the adherent polymer from either an aqueous latex or a solution in a volatile organic solvent. The coating of this type may be applied by dipping, spraying, brushing, rolling, doctoring, painting, printing or the like in a conventional manner. The adhesive polymer of this invention can serve as a tiecoat to bind such systems to the polypropylene and to make available a wettable surface on the polypropylene for the application of the water borne or organic solvent borne system.An alternative to this tiecoat procedure is to utilize the adhesive polymer as the binder or vehicle for the paint or ink or to use it as a portion of the binder or vehicle in which case a sufficient amount of the adhesive polymer of this invention is to be used so that the paint or ink has the surface energy properties necessary for good bonding onto the polyo lef in. Drying and curing steps if desired are similar to those described above.

The following materials and test methods are used in the examples unless in the given example another or a modification is specified.Evaluation Teats 1. Adhesion Several tests are used to evaluate the adhesive vinyl additon polymer adhesion onto polypropylene including tape tests, knife and eraser adhesion tests and an adhesive peel strength test. The tape tests require applying a portion of a tape onto a polypropylene substrate coated with the adhesive polymer system being evaluated. The remainder of the piece of tape is held so a forty five degree angle is made with the plane of the adhered portion of tape and the polypropylene substrate. The tape is then pulled rapidly by hand. This procedure is repeated after using a knife to inscribe a X through the adhesive polymer coating on the polypropylene substrate. The. tape is then applied over the inscribed area and pulled rapidly at a forty five degree angle as before. Two different tapes are used in this test Acetate Fibre Tape 710 3M Company and TFE Plastic Film Tape 5490 a 3.5 mil tape 3M Company .The tape test results are ranked as follows P pass, no loss of binder film off the polypropylene substrate VSF very slight failure, only very slight removal of binder film up to ca. 25 on area covered by tape SF slight failure, some removal of binder film 25 50 on area covered by tape F failure, over 50 removal of film on area covered by tape. In the eraser test three successive draw downs approximately 5 cm 2 in. length of an eraser Efeberhand Faber num 101 are made across the area of polypropylene substrate coated with the film being evaluated. The results are ranked as follows P pass, no exposure of uncoated polypropylene substrate SF slight failure, some exposure of polypropylene substrate up to ca.50 F failure, complete exposure of polypropylene substrate. Adhesion peel strength tests are run at 1800 and 900 T angles. The polypropylene substrate used and the testing conditions are described in each Example. Samples for testing are prepared by coating the adhesive latex polymer or a blend of this with a conventional polymer solids on solids basis as a tiecoat or primer onto the polypropylene with a 30 RDS coating rod.This coat is either dried in an oven at 82 0C 1800F 8 min. and then coated with a topcoat preferably Polymer A below num 75 RDS coating rod , or preferably, the topcoat is applied over the wet tiecoats as specified. In either case after the topcoat is applied the sample is placed in a 82 0C 1800F oven for 8 min. and then laminated to a 0.14 to 0.17 kg 5 to 6 oz warp knit nylon fabric under 0.34 MPa 50 psi pressure for 3 sec. at 1600F. 2.5 cm one inch wide strips of the fabric are used for the peel strength tests. As specified, a 900 T or a 1800 peel strength test is performed on an Instron test machine at a specified cross head speed. All samples are held at ambient conditions for at least ten hours then conditioned at 22 0C 72 0F and 60 relative humidity for one hour before testing. Two test values agreeing within ten percent are accepted, if the first two do not so agree three or four are run to obtain an average deviation of ten percent or less. In other respects the general procedure of ASTM test method D 903 is followed.2. Solubility Solubility profiles are measured by adding a weighed amount of polymer film 0.1 0.5 g to 20 25 ml of a non hydrogen bonding solvent and determining the solubility after 3 days of intermittent agitation. The solubility is determined by separating, drying and weighing the undissolved portion of the film. Solubility parameters ranged from 6.8 to 8.2 for the solvents used isooctane, n pentane, l hexane, diisobutylene and cyclohexane, Polymer Handbook, 2nd ed. , J. Brandrup, E. H. Immergut,J. Wiley and Sons N.Y. 1975 .The solvents are available and further described as follows a 2,2,4 trimethylpentane, isooctane Reagent ACS Eastman, Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, N.Y. 14650 b pentane, 98 Aldrich, Aldrich Chemical Co., Inc., Milwaukee, Wisc..53233 c l hexene, 99 Aldrich, supra, d diisobutylene, practical Eastman, e cyclohexane, ACS Reagent, Aldrich, supra.For crosslinked polymers or crosslinkable polymers the solubility measurements are performed before the crosslinking is effected, this is normally the condition in which the polymer is applied to the polyolefin.3. Contact Angle Measurements and Surface Energy Determinations The equations given by D. K. Owens and R. C. Wendt inJournal of Applied Polymer Science, Vol. 13, p. 1741 1969 are used to determine polymer surface energy.Materials and Equipment a Diiodomethane methylene iodide , Aldrich 99 , stabilized with copper and stored in the dark, is used. b Water is deionized with Technical Amberlite Monomer MB 3 Ion Exchange Resin Rohm and Haas Company before use. c Polymer films are cast on Molar film, free from surface irregularities using RDS Coating Rods µ5 30 . d Contact angle measurements are made using a Contact Angle Goniometer System, Model A100 Rame Hart Inc., 43 Bloomfield Ave., Mountain Lake, N.J. 07046 . Droplets of water and methylene iodide ranging from 2 4 mm in diameter are deposited by means of a micrometer head microsyringe on a level polymer film. The advancing contact angle of the static liquid drop is measured directly by using the Model A100 gonimeter. Measurements are made immediately after the liquid drop is placed on the polymer surface under ambient conditions 22 0.50C . Each contact angle value is an average of 5 separate determinations. The maximum deviation from the mean for a specific system is 20 if a greater deviation is observed rarely more measurements are made. As described by Owens and Wendt, contact angle measurement of water and methylene iodide against a solid lead to simultaneous equations which are solved for the polar and nonpolar component of the solid surface energy with the total surface energy being the sum of these two components. The equation used to determine surface energy isEMI36.1 wherein Q is the measured advancing contact angle. F is a surface free energy. D is a superscript indicating the nonpolar dispersive component of F. P is a superscript indicating the polar component of F. S is a subscript indicating that the surface is between a solid and air L is the corresponding subscript for a liquid air surface.Equation 1 differs from Equation 7 of Owens and Wendt in the identification polar component for their hydrogen bonding component and in the interfaces surfaces being with air rather than the saturated vapor. The total surface energy of a solid is given by FS FSD FSP Eq. 2 The three symbols in Equation 2 are referred to, respectively, elsewhere in this specification, as SE, the total surface energy DCE, the nonpolar dispersive component of the surface energy and PCE, the polar component of the surface energy. The dispersive component, polar component and total surface energies used in the calculations are 21.8, 51.0 and 72.8 ergs. sq.cm., respectively, for water and 48.5, 2.3 and 50.8 ergs. sq.cm., respectively, for methylene iodide see J.R. Dann, J. Colloid andInterface Science Vol. 32, p 302 1970 . The polyolefin substrates in the various examples are untreated polyolefin that is, the polyolefin surface has not been treated by electrical, chemical or other means to make it more easily wettable by water organic solvents and other polymers.

The product is at 34.7 solids and has a pH of 2.0. To obtain a product with higher polymer solids the amount of water in the initial charge is decreased e.g., decreasing the initial charge to 175 parts of water results in a product at about 45 solids. In place of Alipal EP 110 other anionic surfactants such as sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate, tetrasodium N 1,2 dicarboxyethyl N alkyl C18 sulfosuccinamatedisodium salt of half ester of sulfosuccinic acid derived from a C10 C12 straight chain alcohol mixture, disodium salt of half ester of sulfosuccinic acid derived from an ethoxylated nonylphenol or anionic nonionic surfactants such as Abe VA 50 Alcolac Inc may be used, as may mixtures of these as well as mixtures with well known nonionic surfactants.Polymerization Process 2 Redox Emulsion A reaction kettle equipped as in Process 1 is flushed with nitrogen for 15 minutes.

The polymer emulsion is then cooled to room temperature and filtered.It has 48.7 solids and is at a pH of 3.0. Other surfactants such as those described in Example 1 may be used in place of the octylphenoxy polyether.Polymerization Process 3 Solution Polymer A reaction kettle equipped with a stirrer, reflux condenser, thermometer and graduated addition funnel, is flushed with nitrogen for 15 min.
