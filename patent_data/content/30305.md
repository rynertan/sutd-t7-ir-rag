# Chemical pretreatment for method for the electrolytical metal coating of magnesium articles.

## Abstract
Improved method of producing of adherent metallic coatings on articles made from magnesium is disclosed. The articles are exposed to a two step surface activating prior to chemical precipitation of zinc deposit. The first activating is carried out in a solution of oxalic acid and after rinsing a secondary activating takes place in a special bath comprising alkali metal pyrophosphate and prefer ably added wetting agent. The pyrophosphate is prefer ably potassium pyrophosphate K₄P₂O₇.
