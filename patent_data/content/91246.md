## Description
fl RATION ABSORBIN MDUR G WIE FLUID DAJ5PING This invention relates to a vibration absorbing mounting having dynamic spring characteristics due to compressive fluid such as air, and more particularly, to a vibration absorbing mounting with fluid damping intended exclusively for installing in a slanted or non horizontal orientation, which mounting has such an ideal spring characteristic that the dynamic spring rate in the high frequency region is small and the dynamic spring rate in the low frequency region is large, and is constructed to be robust and compact. In resiliently supporting various oscillationgenerating machines such as automobile engines, a resonance phenomenon occurs upon starting or stopping of the machines or owing to exultation caused because a frequency component is generated by the machines in the neighbourhood of the natural frequency of the support system. As a result, excessive vibrational amplitude can cause various troubles or problems. In order to suppress resonance of this kind, rubber material has hitherto been used as a high damper material. However, rubber material has the defects or disadvantages that it exhibits a large creep or permanent set phenomenon and has a poor vibration insulation capacity against high frequency vibrations because of the increase in its modulus of elasticity. Recently,in order to obviate such defects, the trend in vibration dampers or vibration insulators has been toward using an atmospheric suspension or air spring which avails itself of the dynamic spring rate inherent in air. In this case, a large volume air chamber is required to carry a heavy load, thus leading to a large size rubber mounting device. However, if the damping characteristics of the air spring the highamplitude low frequency region are enhanced by increasing the damping coefficient due to air, then the dynamic spring rate due to air will be increased in proportion to the increase, which results in a decrease in vibration absorption capacity in the high frequency region.Conversely, if the vibration absorption performance in the high frequency region is enhanced, damping characteristics in the low frequency region are naturally decreased. In particular, where the air spring is used as a bearing device for an engine mounted in a car, the rotational speed of the engine varies over a wide range, so that many disadvantages and problems have been encountered. In order to cope with the foregoing problems, there has already been provided a vibration absorbing mounting capable of exhibiting satisfactory vibration absorption characteristics in both the high frequency region and the low frequency region, one example of which is shown in Fig, 4.We have proposed a new vibration absorbing mounting in this category, as well. The prior art mounting as shown in Big. 4 is constructed so that a rubber generally cylindrical body 3 is interposed between an upper fitment I which forms an upper seat for fixing to an oscillation generating machine such as an engine and a lower fitment 2 which forms a lower seat for fixing to a chassis or vehicle, the upper face and the lower face of the body 3 are coupled fluidtightly to the upper fitment 1 and the lower fitment 2, respectively, thus forming a fluid chamber 9 enclosed by the lower face of the rubber cylindrical body 3 and the lower fitment 2, which chamber is capable of changing in volume and that a movable partition 4 , which is bonded integrally through a shaft 5 entering fluid tightly and vertically the rubber cylindrical body 3 to the upper fitment 1, is provided laterally within the fluid chamber 9 to divide it into an upper subchamber 9a and a lower sub chamber 9b which communicate with each other through an orifice 10. By that construction, the vibrations coming from the engine are transmitted to the rubber cylindrical body 3 causing volume change of the fluid chamber 9 and moving the movable partition 4 by way of the shaft 5, whereby the volume of one of the upper and lower sub chambers 9a 9b is increased, and the volume of the other is decreased. Thus, the foregoing mounting evidently has the advantage that damping capacity is exhibited by the throttling effect of a fluid passing through the orifice 10. On the other hand, when supporting an automobile engine in a vibration absorbing way, in order to support it while accommodating the vibrations of a rolling direction and lateral direction or vertical direction in a mutually coupling way, it is often necessary to mount the aforesaid vibrationabserbing mounting so that its supporting axis is not in the perpendicular or vertical direction. One example of such a supporting mode is shown in Fig. 5 in which the foregoing vibration absorbing mounting M is mounted to assume such a slanted orientation that the support axis direction and the loading direction intersect at an acute angle. However, this vibration absorbing mounting M for general use is designed from the premise that it is installed in the horizontal orientation in which the support axis direction and the load imposing direction are in accord with each other, and an elastic ring 8 of the movable partition 4 extending movably between the surrounding portion of the shaft 5 and an annular area of the lower fitment 2 adopts a shape having rotational symmetry around the shaft 5, substantially at right angles to it. When the mounting thus constructed is installed in a slanted orientation and the elastic ring 8 is slanted, in the top portion 8a of it stress due to a load acts as a force stretching it in an obliquely downward direction whereas in the bottom portion 8b , the stress acts as a force causing it to buckle. As a result, the top portion 8a is little affected whereas the bottom portion 8b is oscillated in a buckled state, so that breakage is liable to occur at the buckled position and not only is the vibration absorbing function lost, as expected,but also the life span is shortened, which requires repeated exchange of the unit for a new one. Thus, the prior art mounting is disadvantageous in respect of maintenance and cost. In view of the present situation where the above problems have remained unsolved, this invention aiss to provide a vibration absorbing mounting with fluid damping for use exclusively installed in a slanted orientation, which is capable of exhibiting a reliable vibration absorbing performance over a long period of time. More particularly, this invention relates to an improvement in a movable partition member including an elastic ring, for a mounting device of the above described type by constructing it so that concentration of stress leading to buckling can be precluded. According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a vibration absorbing mounting intended for use exclusively in a slanted installation, in which a rubber cylindrical body is interposed between upper and lower fitments with its upper surface and lower surface bonded fluid tightly and integrally to the upper fitment and the lower fitment, respectively, thus defining a fluid chamber capable of changing in volume and enclosed by the lower face of the rubber cylindrical body and the lower fitment a movable partition member bonded integrally to the upper fitment through a shaft entering vertically and fluid tightly the rubber cylindrical body is provided laterally within the fluid chamber to divide it into upper and lower sub chambers which are arranged to admit compressive fluid thereto or release it therefrom through an orifice in response to variations in chamber volume and the movable partition member comprises an elastic ring which extends between the surrounding portion of the shaft and an annular portion of the lower fitment, the eleastic ring being formed of such a distorted ring that the top side and the bottom side of the elastic ring when located slantwise upon mounting are deformed under the imposition of a definite load to constitute nearly horizontal, mutually parallel profiles and, under a non load condition, the top side defines a larger angle to the shaft than the bottom side and an intermediate portion extending between the top side and bottom side of the elastic ring is gradually changed in the angle defined between it and the shaft, whereby there occurs no stress concentration on any portions of the elastic ring of the movable partition, the elastic ring does not buckle and damping capacity against the low frequency vibrations and spring characteristics against the high frequency vibrations are exhibited stably over a long period of time. another aspect of the invention provides a vibration absorbing mounting,comprising first and second mounting members, a resiliently compressible body extending between the mounting members and affixed thereto to form a chamber, an axial shaft extending from the first mounting member and an at least partly flexible diaphragm located across the chamber to form sub chambers, said diaphragm being coupled to the shaft to move therewith in response to movements of said first mounting member, bleed means for allowing compressible fluid to bleed from and to each said sub chamber on volume changes of said sub chambers, characterised in that said flexible diaphragm Is adapted to adopt a substantially non buckled configuration on loading said shaft in a substantially nonaxial direction. The invention will be further described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is an elevational view in section of an embodiment of the invention Fig. 2 is an underneath view of the mounting shown in Fig. 1 Fig. 3 is a schematic elevational view in section of the mounting according to this invention installed for supporting in a vibration absorbing manner Fig. 4 is an elevational view in section of a prior art mounting and Fig. 5 is a schematic illustration of the mounting as shown in Fig. 4 showing a mounting state for the vibration absorbing support. Referring to Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, the vibration absorbing mounting with fluid damping according to this invention is of a type using compressible fluid such as air, and comprises an upper fitment 1, a lower fitment 2, a rubber cylindrical body 3 and a movable partition 4. The upper fitment 1 is an upper seat for fixing to a vibration absorbing machine, e.g. an engine and the lower fitment 2 is a lower seat for securing to a chassis e.g. of a vehicle, or vice versa. The rubber cylindrical body 3 is, in Fig. 1, formed of an hourglass shaped cylindrical body having a bore axially through the centre thereof for receiving a shaft 5 therein in a fluid tight fit, and is interposed between the upper and lower fitments 1, 2 with its upper face and its lower surrounding face bonded integrally and hermetically to the upper fitment 1 and the lower fitment 2, respectively. However, the shape of the rubber cylindrical body 3 is not limited to a cylinder shape, and may be an appropriate body of rotation such as a frusto conical shape. By the bonding, there is defined a void space enclosed between the lower or inner face of the rubber cylindrical body 3 and the lower fitment 2, the void space serving as an air chamber 9 for admitting compressive fluid which is capable of changing in volume. The movable partition member 4 is made of a rubber and formed in an appropriate shape. It is bonded integrally to the upper fitment 1 through the shaft 5, which enters vertically and airtightly the rubber cylindrical body 3, and is provided horizontally within the air chamber 9 to divide it into upper sub chamber 9a and lower sub chamber 9b. Upon mould shaping, the rubber cylindrical body 3 and the movable partition 4 are joined and attached to rigid annular bodies 6, 12 for bonding integrally to the lower fitment 2 at their respective perimeters. The movable partition 4 is further rigid and fast with a rigid plate 7 to increase mechanical securement to the shaft 5. The upper fitment 1 and the shaft 5 can be rendered integral by welding or by fastening a threaded portion on a head of the shaft 5 to a housing of an engine, or to a vehicle or other frame body by means of a nut. In the mounting device thus constructed, when an engine body is vibrated, the rubber cylindrical body 3 undergoes a dynamic compressive flexure through the upper fitment 1, and the movable partition 4 is subjected to upper and lower compressive flexures through the shaft 5, whereby the upper sub chamber 9a and the lower sub chamber 9b change in volume. Air is withdrawn from or admitted to the subchambers 9a, 9b in response to such volume variations, so that a suitable damping capacity is exhibited. To that end, an orifice 10 having a throttling function is apertured in an appropriate position of the movable partition 4 to put both the sub chambers 9a, 9b in communication with each other. It is theoretically established that the magnitude of damping capacity obtained by the throttling effect of air passing through the orifice 10 is proportional to the rates of volume change of the sub chambers 9a,9b corresponding to dynamic displacement and is inversely proportional to the volumes. of the sub chambers 9a,9b. In addition to the embodiment as illustrated where the sub chambers 9a, 9b are put in communication with one another through the one orifice 10, other changes or variations may be made, for example, if only the admission or withdrawal of air is conducted by means of orifice s having a throttling function. For example, each orifice may be apertured at an appropriate place to put each of the subchambers 9a, 9b in communication with the atmosphere, whereby when the movable partition 4 moves and the respective air subchambers are changed in volume, air is admitted to or released from them in response to the magnitude of the volume change. In the vibration absorbing mounting device having such springing characteristics to vibrations and damping function, an elastic ring 8 of the movable partition 4 movably extending from the surrounding portion of the shaft 5 to the annular portion of the lower fitment 2 is shaped to assume a linear symmetrtsrelative to a standard line passing through the shaft 5, which is a feature of this invention in marked distinction from prior art devices in which the elastic ring 8 of the movable partition 4 is formed to have rotational symmetry relative to the shaft. Stated another way, the elastic ring 8 is shaped of such a distorted ring that the portion 8a, which will be the upper or top portion, and portion 8b which will be the lower or bottom portion, of the elastic ring 8 are, when the vibration proof mounting is mounted slantwise under the imposition of a definite load, deformed and profiled to be nearly horizontal and parallel to one another, whereas under no load condition where an engine or other body to be supported is not attached, the angle of the portion 8a to the shaft is larger than that of the portion 8b to the shaft. The distorted ring constituting the elastic ring 8 is further profiled so that the intermediate portion extending between the portion 8a and the portion 8b is, under no load condition, gradually, continuously changed in its angle to the shaft 5 between the obtuse angle of the top portion 8a and the acute angle of the botton portion 8b. By forming the elastic ring 8 distorted in this way, when the vibration absorbing mounting is installed Xlantwise and supports an engine or like thereon, as shown in Fig. 3, the portion 8a and the bottom portion 8b of the elastic ring 8 are stretched or displaced in a flat fashion by the action of component forces of the perpendicular load of the engine both in the direction of the shaft 5 and in the direction normal to the shaft 5, thus being profiled to be nearly horizontal and parallel with one another. As a consequence, there is no fear of causing buckling,particularly in the bottom portion 8b,at all and the flat stretched state is securely retained when oscillations are transmitted, so that breakage to which a buckled portion is susceptible can be prevented from occurring. Moreover, the elastic ring 8 is oscillated keeping its flat state, and as a result, predetermined values of volume change of the chamber, as designed, are reliably produced, so that the desired vibration absorption performance is exhibited. The elastic ring 8 is not always required to be shaped in a flat and planar form, but may be shaped in a bellows or fluted form. Accordingly, the term flat state referred to above shall be interpreted in a broad sense to mean the state that the elastic ring is stretched or displaced in a generally flat fashion, there being no undesirably buckled portions. In the illustrated embodiment, the lower fitment 2 has a convex portion 11 in its bottom plate area 2a facing the movable partition 4, the convex portion being raised on the side of the movable partition. The convex portion 11 is located in the area facing the elastic ring 8 and is profiled so that the portion on the side of the bottom portion 8b is raised the most and the portion on the side of the top portion 8a is not raised, the rise being gradually decreased from the former to the latter, thus forming a horseshoe shaped projection on the bottom area having a decreasing depth from left to right as seen in Fig. 1. The convex portion 11 preferably rises to near the level of the lower surface of the elastic ring 8 under loaded conditions, so long as it does not interfere with the elastic ring 8. This provides an advantage in that the volume of the lower sub chamber 9b is reduced and the damping factor against vibrations in the low frequency region is increased, and assists greatly in enhancing the function of the vibration absorbing support by avoiding that the deviated stress is exerted on the vibration absorbing mounting device since the pressure of a compressive fluid acts uniformly upon any portions of the surface of the movable partition member 4. As described above, according to this invention there is provided a vibration absorbing mounting in which the elastic ring 8 of the movable partition 4 is formed by a ring which is distorted such that it assumes a flat profile under a load imposed in obliquely intersecting directions relative to the shaft 5. Accordingly, there is no problem of breakage due to buckling as is the case with prior art mountings in which partial buckling is caused and as a result,Jbreakage occurs in the buckled portion after repeated oscillations, and,therefore, long life span is attainable. Furthermore, since the movable partition 4 retains, under the supporting condition, a nearly flat stretched state in every region thereof whenever vibration occurs, volume changes of the upper sub chamber 9a and the lower sub chamber 9b are correctly achieved in response to the magnitudes of the vibrations, so that vibration absorption performance is exhibited accurately according to design conditions.
