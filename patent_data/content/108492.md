## Description
COMPOSITE PHOTOCELL The present invention relates to a composite photocell provided with a charging mechanism, and more particularly to a thin, lightweight composite photocell capable of producing an electromotive force independently of lightness. As is well known, a semipermanent composite cell which operates day and night, can be formed by using a solar cell as the charging source of a secondary cell. However, a conventional composite cell is required to include a strong substrate because of the structure of a secondary cell. Accordingly, it is impossible to make each of the thickness and weight of the composite cells sweller than a certain value. Further, since the solar cell does not serve as a satisfactory char ng source of the secondary cell, it is not possible to corpletely recover the discharge current sf the secondary cell, and therefore the life of the composite cell is limited. It is an object of the present invention to provide a thin, lightweight composite cell which can operate semipermanently without artificial supplement of energy, e.g. without special charging operation. It is another object of the present invention to provide a thin, lightweight conposite cii curable of operating semipermanently without artificial supplement of energy, in which a secondary cell is charged by a solar cell. According to the present invention, there is provided a composite photocell which comprises a solar cell provided on one of a pair of main surfaces of a substrate, and a thinfilm secondary cell provided on the above mentioned one main surface or the other main surface of the substrate. Optional features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a graph showing the variation of electromotive force of a lithium cell with the discharge thereof and Figs. 2, 3A and 3B are sectional and diagramatic views showing embodiments of a com osite photocell and a cash card according to the present invention. First, explanation will be made on the operation mechanism of a secondary cell hereinafter referred to as a Li cell . The electromotive force of Li cell is generated in such a manner that a Li lithium atom in a cathode made of Li compounds such as LiSi and LiAl, passes through a solid electrolyte layer in the form of a Li ion, and then reaches an anode. In other words, the composition Lix Tis2 of the anode varies with the discharge of Li cell, that is, x is changed from zerc to 2. Further, as shown in Fig. 1, the electromotive force of Li cell is equal to ca. 2.5 V at x 0, and then gradually decreases to become equal to 1.85 V at x 1.0.When x exceeds 1.0, the electromotive torce decreases abruptly. A cell havirg an electromotive force of more than 2.5 V is used for charging the discharged Li cell.The direction of reaction in the charring process of theLi cell is opposite to that in the discharge process.That is, when the charging is made, a Li atom in the anode passes through the solid electrolyte layer in the form of a Li ion, and then reaches the cathode. In the case where the value of x is increased to more than 1 due to overdischarge, it is impossible to completely recover the electromotive force of the Li cell. However, in the case where x is less than 1, any deterioration of Li cell is not observed after charge and discharge have been repeated up to about one hundred times. The above mentioned fact that a cell having an electromotive force of about 2.5 V is required to charge the Li cell and the fact that the possibility of deterioration in the Li cell is prevented by charging the Li cell in a relatively short time, show tat it is advantageous to use a solar cell as the power supply for chargLi cell. Next, it will be explained that micro crystalline silicon containing hydrogen hereinafter referred to as n Si H is advantageously used to form a solar cell. However, a material for making a solar cell according to the present invention is not limited to the p Si H in which hydrogen is added to the interface between micro crystalline grains, to decrease the nu Der of deep level recombination centers caused by interface strains and dangling bonds, but the following materials may be used in place of the Si H.That is, poLy crystalline silicon containing hydrogen, amorphous silicon a Si which contains hydrogen to make long the life of photo excited carrier on the basis of the above mentioned decrease in the number of deep level recombination centers, or a composite material in which the W Si H and the a Si H coexist, may be used in place of the Si H. The first advantage obtained when the p Si H is used as the material of a solar cell, resides in that the open circuit voltage of the solar cell is as large as 0.9 to 1.3 V, and therefore a desired electromotive force can be obtained by connecting two or more solar cells in series or forming in one solar cell at least two pn junctions, pin junctions, or Schottky contacts.The second advantage resides in that the solar cell has a large absorption coefficient for light, and therefore the thickness of the solar cell can be made small.Further, the third advantage resides in that the solar cell can be forred at a relatively low temperature of 150 to 450 C, and therefore 2 substrate for supporting the solar cell can be made of various r.0 S. It is 5 needless to say that the solar cell may be made of the u Si H by the conventional glow discharge method. Not only the solar cell but also the Li cell has features that the cell is small in thickness and that various substrates can be used to support the cell.According to the present invention, the solar cell andLi cell are both deposited on the same substrate to make the best use of the above mentioned features, and thus a thin, lightweight composite photocell is obtained. Now, an embodiment of a composite photocell according to the present invention will be explained below, with reference to Fig. 2. Referring to Fig. 2, on one of a pair of main surfaces of a resin film 8 which is made of a resin material selected from the polyimide group and is heated to 3000 C, is formed aTis2 electrode 3 through the CVD or plasma CVD method in which TiCl and H2S are used as the source gas.Thereafter, Li4SiO4.Li3PO4 is sputtered to form a solid electrolyte layer 9 on the electrode 3 heated to 1500 C. Next, an aluminum electrode 4 is formed on the other main surface of the resin film 8 heated to 1500 C. Then, the resin film 8 usel as a substrate is heated to 250 C, and a p Si X layer is formed on the electrode 4 in the atmosphere of H2 by the plasma CVD method in which silane SiH4 is used as thY source gas. In more detail, an n type silicon layer 5 is first fcr to a thickness of 50 nm by mixing phosphine PH3 into the source gas. Then, a silicon layer 6 of intrinsic conductivity is formed to a thickness of 600 r ., and a p type silicon layer 7 is formed on the layer 6 to a thickness of 15 nm by mixing diborane B 2H6 into the source gas. Such a process is twice repeated to form a p Si H layer in which two pin structures overlap each other.In this case, however, the nper silicon layer 6 of intrinsic conductivity is formed to a thickness of 50 nm so as to realize high efficiency of photocurrent. Then, a transparent electrode 1, for example, a nesa film is formed on the Si H layer at about l500C to complete a solar cell.Thus, the two cells are formed of deposited layers. Thereafter, the substrate 8 is heated to 1000 C, and a LiAl electrode 2 it formed on the solid electrolyte layer 9 which is made of Li4SiO4 Li3PO4 A collector electrode, for example, made of nickel Ni may be superposed on the LiAl electrode. A passivation film 10 made of Si3N4 or the like is formed on the LiAl or the composite electrode 2 at about 1000C. Finally, a pair of output terminals 11 are provided as shown in Fig. 2. The total arge which can be taken out of theLi cell having the above mentioned structure at one discharge process, corresponds to the change of the anode material from TiS2 to LiTiS2, and is determined by the volume of the anode 3. In more detail, an electric charge of 0.8 Ahr ampere hour can be taken out of the Li cell when the Tis2 electrode 3 has a volume of 1 cm3. For example, when the Tis2 electrode has an area of 10 cm2 and a thickness of 1 um, an electric charge of 0.8 x 10 3 Ahr can be taken out of the Li cell, and the Li cell can be used for about 800 consecutive hours if a current of about 1 A is caused to flow from theLi cell to the outside. On the other hand, when the solar cell having the above mentioned structure is illuminated with the sunlight, a current of ore than 100 mA can be taken out of the solar cell.Accordingly, it is possible to charge the Li cell in one minute. In case of rain or in the case where the composite photocell is placed in a room, it may take several hours to charge the Li cell. Actually, it is rare to operate the Li cell for 800 consecutive hours, and no problem arises if the Li cell is set to the charging as shown in Fig. 2 during the period when the Li cell is not operated. In some cases, in order to prevent the electromotive force of the Li cell from decreasing to less than a critical value of 1.85 V and to present the Li cell from deteriorating on the basis of such a decrease n electromotive force, the corposite photocell is required to have an alarm lamp which is turned c at a voltage approximately equal to the critical voltage. In the above mentioned embodiment, the Li cell is used as a main cell, and the solar cell as a power source for charging the Li cell. However, the solar cell may be used as the main cell and the Li cell as an auxiliary storage battery. Further, when the solar cell is combined with a Li primary cell, the life of the primary cell can be prolonged. soler arterial which has either or both of the Si ana the a Si H as the matrix and further contains one or more than one species of carbon, germanium, tin, halogen, and others, can be improved. Group IV elements modifies the emf. Such solar cells have been known. However, as a matter of course, such a solar cell can operate only when it is illuminated with light. In order to solve this problem, the solar cell is combined with a secondary cell capable of being charged. However, a strong sub strate is indispensable for a conventional secondary cell because of the structure thereof, and therefore not only the thickness of the secondary cell becomes greater than 1.3 mm but also the weight thereon is increased. Further, the conventional secondary cell does not match the solar cell in electromotive force and current, and the composite photocell including the conventional secondary cell and the solar cell is relatively short in life. According to the present invention, the abovementioned drawbacks can be completely overcome. A main advantage of the present invention which is to be emphasized, is to be able to provide a composite photocell which has the form of a thin film and is light in weight. Figs. 3A and 3B show an embodiment of a cash card with a built in microcomputer. A silicon solar a Li cell 14 are embodiment. A utilization circuit 16 such as a microprocessor chip and terminals 18 are also provided to make small the quantity of information exchanged between a main computer and a ternal. Similarly, a composite photocell as described above is best suited for the built in battery of the various cards. Further, a composite photocell as described above is suitable for a power supply for drving an ordinary electronic desk computer, and can be mounted on an artificial satellite. The substrate for supporting the solar cell and Li cell may be formed of a rigid plate such as a glass plate, or a resin film made of polyimide or the like. Further, the substrate may be formed of metal foil which is made of a material selected from a group including titanium, niobium, vanadium, molybdenum, a stainless alloy. and others, or a flexible plate containing the resin film and metal foil. In this case, the electrode 4 for the solar cell can be dispensed With.Further, the deposition temperature ay be raised fcr the modification of Tis2 electrode characteristics.
