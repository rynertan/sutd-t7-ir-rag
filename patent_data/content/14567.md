## Description
PROCESSES FOR PREPARATION OF ss LACTAM COMPOUNDS An intensive research effort in the field of cephalosporin antibiotics has produced a number of clinically significant cephalosporin compounds. One of the more recent developments in this area has been the discovery of cephem compounds directly substituted with halogen at the C 3 position. A number of 3 halo 3 cephems have been described by Chauvette ln U.S.Patents Nos. 3,925,372, 4,064,343 and 3,962,227. These potent antibiotic compounds are prepared by helogenation of the corresponding 3 hydroxy 3 cephems. The halo genation of 3 hydroxy 3 cephems to provide 3 chlcro and 3 bromo 3 cephems has typically been carried out by reacting the 3 hydroxy 3 cephem compounds with brominating or chlorinating agents including phosgene, oxalyl chloride, thionyl chloride, thionyl bromide and phosphorous halides such as phosphorous trichloriae and phosphorus tribromide, usually in the presence of dimethylformamide. Also, in the preparation of semi synthetic penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics most chemical modifications are preformed on R lactam substrates bearing 0 6 or C 7 acylamino groups which are stable te the process conditions but are not preferred for maximum antibiotic activity.Thus, a process step common to the production of most if not all of the known clinically significant penicillins and cephalosporins is te cleavage of the C 6 or C 7 acylamlno group to provide the corresponding C 5 or C 7 amine compounds which are reacylated as desired. Undoubtedly the most widely used method for cleaving penicillin and cephalosporin acylamino side chains is that wherein theC 6 or C 7 acylamino compound is first converted to the corresponding imino halide and then to an imino ether which, upon acidic hydrolysis or alcoholysis, provides the nucleus C 6 or C 7 amino compounds. This general method and improvements thereof have been described in a number of U.S. Patents including Nos. 3,549,628, 3,575,970, 3,697,515, 3,845,043 and 3,868,368. A number of acid halides, especially, acid chlorides, derived from phosphorous, carbon and sulfur or their oxygen acids have been disclosed as useful for preparing the imino halide intermediates of the threestep amido cleavage process. Phosphorous oxychloride, phosphorous pentachloride, phosphorous trichloride, thidnyl chloride, phosgene, oxalyl chloride and catechylphosphorous trichloride have, in particular, been described as suitable imino halide forming reagents.Laboratory experience has shown phosphorus pentachloride to be a preferred acid halide reagent for intermediate imino halide preparation. Cephalosporin sulfoxides are.also widely used intermediates in the synthesis of cephalosporin antibiotics. Following the completion of the reactions or synthetic procedures employing the sulfoxide form of a cephalosporin, the sulfoxide function is reduced to provide the cephalosporin molecule in the reduced or sulfide state. Prior to this invention one preferred method for reducing cephalosporin sulfoxides was that ofMurphy et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,641,014. According to this method, cephalosporin sulfoxides are reduced with 1 hydrogen and a hydrogenation catalyst, 2 stannous, ferrous, cuprous, or manganous cations, 3 dithionite, iodide, or ferrocyanide, 4 trivalent phosphorous compounds, 5 halosilanes or 6 chloromethylene minium chlorides wherein certain of these reducing agents require the use of an activator such as acetyl chloride or phosphorous trichloride. For example, sodium dithionate is activated with acetyl chloride in the reduction. Another method for the reduction of cephalosporin sulfoxides was disclosed by Hatfield in U.S.Patent No. 4,044,002 which describe the reduction of cephalosporin sulfoxides using acyl bromides in the presence of bromine scavengers. More recently Kukolja and Spry described the reduction chlorinatior. of 3hydroxycephem sulfoxides using phosphorous trichloride, phosphorous pentachloride or phosgene in the presence of dimethylformamide. Recently we have discovered 2 novel class cf compounds derived not from phosphorous oxygen acids but from aryl esters thereof. More specifically we have discovered that selected triaryl phosphites react with equivalent amounts of chlorine or bromine to provide, initially, kinetically controlled products which, although thermodynamically unstable, can be used advantageously in the preparation of R lactam compounds.These novel triaryl phosphite halogen compounds are disclosed and claimed in our co pending applicationNo. filed on even date herewith.

The compounds used in these processes, triaryl phosphite halogen complexes, are recently discovered compounds derived from the reaction of selected triaryl phosphites and chlorine or bromine. Triaryl phosphites of the formulaEMI23.1 wherein Z is hydrogen, halo, C1 C4 alkyl or C1 C4 alkoxy, react with equivalent amounts of chlorine or bromine in a substantially anhydrous inert organic solvent to provide, initially, kinetically controlled products having the empirical formulaEMI23.2 wherein Z is as defined above and X is C1 or Br. The term halo in the definition of Z includes chloro, bromo or iodo. C1 C4 Alkyl includes methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, n propyl, n butyl, secbutyl, tert butyl and isobutyl. Representative C1 C4 alkoxy groups are methoxy, ethoxy, isopropoxy, tertbutoxy and n butoxy. The dot . in the general formula used to represent the kinetically controlled products employed in the present processes is used simply to designate that equivalent amounts of halogen and triaryl phoshite are combined chemically and in a way that can be distinguished from that in the thermodynamically stable derivatives which have been known in the art and which typically have been drawn without the dot te.g. PhO 3PC12 . The exact molecular form of the triaryl phosphite halogen kinetic complexes described herein has not been established definitively however, physicalchemical data do indicate that the kinetic product is one wherein the phosphoric center aquires some cationic character. Herein the terms kinetic compound , kinetic complex , triaryl phosphite halogen complex compound , kinetically controlled products and kinetically controlled halogenating reducing compounds are used synonomously. Suitable triaryl phosphites for the preparation of the kinetically controlled compounds sed in the present process include triphenyl phosphite, tri p methoxyphenyl phosphite, tri o chlorophenyl phosphite, tri p chlorophenyl phosphite, tri p tolyll phosphite, tri o tolyl phosphite, tri m bromophenyl phosphite, tri p bromophenyl phosphite, tri p iodophenyl phosphite, tri p n propylphenyl phosphite, tri p tert butylphenyl phosphite, tri m tolyi phosphite, tri p isopropoxyphenyl phosphite and the like, Triphenyl phosphite is preferred, primarily because of commercial availability. Any of a wide variety of inert organic solvents may be employed as the medium for the preparation of the kinetically controlled compounds and for the reduction and reduction halogenation processes described hereinbelow. By inert organic solvent is meant an organic solvent which under the reaction conditions of the preparation does not enter into any appreciable reaction with either the reactants or the products. Since the halogenating compounds are susceptible to reaction with protic compounds, such compounds, including water, alcohols, amines other than tertiary , thiols, organic acids and other such protic compounds should be excluded from the reaction medium. A substantially anhydrous aprotic organic solvent is preferred. The term substantially anhydrous as used in the present description means that although anhydrous organic solvents are generally preferred, trace amounts of water, such as that often found in commercially available solvents, can be tolerated.Although the kinetic products described herein will react with any water present in the solvent medium, additional amounts of reagents can easily be added to compensate for the loss due to hydrolysis. it is preferred that conventional laboratory techniques be employed to dry the solvents employed and to exclude moisture from the reaction mixtures. Suitable solvents include hydrocarbons, both aliphatic and aromatic, including pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, cyclohexane, cyclopentane, benzene, toluene, o , m or p xylene, mesitylene and the like ethers, cyclic and acyclic such as diethyl ether, butyl ethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, 1,2 dimethoxyethane and the like carboxylic acid esters such as ethyl acetate, methylformate, methyl acetate, amyl acetate, n butyl acetate, sec butyl acetate, methyl propionate, methyl butyrate and the like nitriles such as acetonitrile, propionitrile, butyronitrile and the like halogenated hydrocarbons, both aromatic and aliphatic, such as chloroform, methylene chloride, carbon tetrachloride, 1,2 dichloroethane ethylene dichloride , 1,1,2 trichloroethane, 1,1 dibromo 2 chloroethane, 2 chloropropane, l chlorobutane, chlorobenzene, fluorobenzene, o , m , or p chlorotoluene, o , m , or p bromotoluene, dichlorobenzene and the like and nitro compounds such as nitromethane, nitroethane, 1 or 2 nitropropane, nitrobenzene and the like. The particular inert organic solvent employed as a medium for the preparation of the kinetically controlled triaryl phosphite halogen compounds or as a medium for their use in the present processes is not critical, however, such solvent properties as polarity, melting or boiling point, and ease of isolation of products may be considered in selecting a most suitable solvent. Preferred solvents for the preparation of the kinetically controlled products and for the present processes described hereinbelow are hydrocarbons, especially aromatic hydrocarbons, and halogenated hydrocarbons. Halogenated hydrocarbons other than chloroform are more preferred. Methylene chloride is most preferred. If a compound derived from the kinetically controlled reaction of a triaryl phosphite and chlorine or bromine is allowed to stand in solution it converts or isomerizes to the corresponding thermodynamically stable compound at varying rates depending on, among other things, the nature of the triaryl phosphite, the solvent, the halogen, and the solution temperature.Experimental data has also shown that the presence of an acid HX or an excess of triaryl phosphite will enhance the rate of conversion of the kinetic to the thermodynamic product. Using 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy the half life of the kinetically controlled product from the reaction of triphenyl phosphite and chlorine in methylene chloride at room temperature was determined to be about 8 hours. A half life of about 39 hours was observed for the triphenyl phosphitebromine kinetic complex under the same conditions. As mentioned above the observed half life rate of conversion for any given kinetic complex described herein can be affected by the solvent and by the presence of a hydrogen halide acid HX or excess triaryl phosphite.Thus, for example, a shorter half life will be observed where the solvent for the preparation of kinetic complex has not been rigorously dried the hydrogen halide acid produced from reaction of the kinetic complex with the moisture present in the solvent will enhance the rate of conversion to the stable form.Table I presents a summary of several properties of the kinetically controlled product and the corresponding thermodynamically controlled product of the reaction of triphenyl phosphite and chlorine.

In some cases, including the reaction of triaryl phosphites with chlorine or bromine, the rate of formation of the kinetic product and the rate of thermodynamic equilibrium is such that the kinetically controlled product can be prepared and utilized before any significant amount of the kinetically controlled product equilibrates or isomerizes to the thermodynamically stable product. To maximize the production and stability of the kinetically controlled product, reaction conditions are selected so as to minimize the potential for thermodynamic equilibrium of the initial product of the reaction. Most simply conditions for kinetic control are achieved both by lowering the reaction temperature and the temperature of the kinetic product after it is formed, and by minimizing the time allowed for thermodynamic equilibrium, such as, by utilizing the kinetic product in a subsequent reaction shortly after it has been prepared. Typically the reactants, a triaryl phosphite and chlorine or bromine, are combined in a substantially anhydrous inert organic solvent at a temperature below about 3000. Although the kinetically controlled products are formed at higher temperature, such con ditions favor the formation of the thermodynamically controlled products. Preferably the triaryl phosphitehalogen compounds are prepared at tempexatures at or below about 3000. Minimum reaction temperature are, of course, determined by the freezing point of the solvent employed for the preparation. Most preferred reaction temperatures are in the range of about 700 to about OOC. It has been found that the triaryl phosphite itself reacts to some extent with its kinetic reaction product with chlorine or bromine, effectively increasing the rate of conversion to the corresponding thermodynamic product. It is preferred, therefore, but not required, that an excess of halogen be maintained in the reaction mixture during the formation of the kinetic compounds. This can be achieved practicaily by adding the triaryl phosphite to a solution of an equivalent amount of the halogen or by adding the halogen and the triaryl phosphite simultaneously to 2 quantity of inert organic solvent at the desired temperature.The co addition of reagents is conducted at such a rate that the color of the halogen persists in the reaction mixture until the last drop of triaryl phosphite discharges the color. Alternatively excess halogen can be discharged using known halogen scavengers such as acetylenes, or olefines including alkenes, dienes, cycloalkenes, or bicycloalkenes. A preferred scavenger is a C2 to C6 alkene for example, ethylene, propylene, butylene, or amylene. The kinetically controlled triaryl phosphite halogen complexes used in the process of the present invention are stabilized in solution by the addition of about 10 to about 100 mole percent of a tertiary amine base having z PKb value of about 6 to about 10. If, for example, about 50 mole percent of pyridine is added to a solution of the kinetically controlled product of the reaction of triphenyl phosphite and chlorine in methylene chloride, only trace amounts of the thermodynamic equilibrium product can be detected by 31p nmr, even after prolonged periods at room temperature.The tertiary amine base can be added to a solution of the freshly prepared triaryl phosphitehalogen complex or, optionally, it can be employed in the reaction mixture of the triaryl phosphite and halogen to produce a stabilized solution of the kinetically controlled product used in the present invention.The Halogen Scavenger As the reduction process of the present invention proceeds, chlorine or bromine depending on the triaryl phosphite halogen complex employed is produced as a by product. In order to prevent undesliable side reactions between the halogen by product and the cephalosporin product, a halogen scavenger is used in the reaction mixture to react with or inactivate the chlorine or bromine as it is formed. The term halogen scavenger as used herein in the description of the present invention refers to organic substances which react readily with chlorine or bromine and which do not react with the triaryl phosphite halogen complex used as a reducing agent in the present process.Representative of halogen scavengers which can be employed in the present process are alkenes, cycloalkenes bicycloalkenes, dienes, cyclodienes, bicyclodienes, alkynes or substituted aromatic hydrocarbons which readily undergo electrophilic substitution with brcmine or chlorine, for example monohydric phenols and the ethers and esters of monohydric and polyhydric phenols.Examples of such halogen scavengers include the C2 to C10 alkenes, such as ethylene, propylene, butene l, butene 2, isobutylene, pentene l, penten 2, 2 methylbutene l, 3 methylbutene l, hexene l, heptene l, octene l, the isomeric nonenes, and the like cycloalkenes having from 5 to 8 ring carbon atoms such as cyclopentene, cyclohexene, cycloheptene, and cyclooctene C4 C8 dienes and cyclodienes having from 5 8 ring carbon atoms, for example, pentadiene, hexadiene, heptadiene, cyclopentadiene, cyclohexadiene, cyclooctadiene, 2,3 dimethylbutadiene 1,3 isoprene, and the like alkynes having from 2 6 carbon atoms, such as acetylene, methylacetylene, ethylacetylene, cirethyl acetylene, pentyne l, pentyne 2, the isomeric hexynes, 3 methylbutyne l, 3,3 dimethylbutyne l, and like acetylenes wherein the acetylenic bond will rapidly add chlorine or bromine phenylacetylene was found to be an unsatisfactory chlorine scavenger bicyclic unsaturated hydrocarbons such a camphene and pinene and phenol ethers, substituted phenol ethers, and lower alkanoyl phenol esters represented by the formulaEMI32.1 wherein R4 is C1 C4 alkyl or C2 C5 alkanoyl, R5, and R6, are independently hydrogen, C1 C4 alkoxy, C C5 alkanoyl, or C1 C4 alkyl. Examples of such derivatives include the hydroquinone monomethyl ether, hydroquinone dimethyl ether, anisole, phenetole, mdimethoxybenzene, veratrole, phenyl propionate, phenyl acetate, resorcinol diacetate, and like phenol ethers and esters which react readily with chlorine or bromine. Preferred halogen scavengers are C2 C6 alkenes, for example, ethylene, propylene, butylene amylene, cyclopentene or cyclohexene. Since theoretically at least 1 molar equivalent of halogen is produced for each equivalent of sulfoxide reduced in the present process, at least a molar equivalent amount of halogen scavenger is employed in the cephalosporin sulfoxide reduction process for each equivalent of cephalosporin suloxide starting materIal. Typically about 1 to about 3 molar equivalents of halogen scavenger is used for each equivalent of starting material however, larger amounts of halogen scavenger can be employed without affecting the reduction process. C 7 Acylamino cephalosporin and 0 6 acylamino penicillin starting materials for the present halo genating process are all known compounds, or they can be derived from known compounds by conventional procedures. The patent and chemical literature is replete with teachings of how to prepare penicillin and cephalosporin compounds which can be used in the present process.

The starting materials for the present process can be represented by the general formulaEMI34.1 wherein R, R1, R7 and Y are as defined above.To the extent that there are no unprotected amino, hydroxy, carboxy groups or other protic substituents on these starting materials, the nature of the variablesR, R1, Y and R7 is not critical to the present process.It is the 0 6 or C 7 amido functionality which is modified under the conditions of the present process, from CONE toEMI34.2 wherein X is chloro or bromo.

Each of the process embodiments described above is conducted in the presence of a tertiary amine base. Typically from about 1.0 to about 1.2 equivalents and preferably about 1.0 equivalents of a tertiary amine base is employed for each equivalent of halogenating agent. Preferred tertiary amines bases for this process and the combination enol halogenatlon imino halogenation described herein below are those having value of about 1 to about 10. More preferred are those tertiary amine bases having a PKb value of about 6 to about 10.Exemplary of suitable tertiary amine bases for use in the presence invention are trialkylamines such as trimethylamine, triethylamine, tri npropylamine, ethyldimethylamine, benzyldiethylamine and the like dialkylarylamines such as dimethylaniline, diethylaniline, N,N diethyl 4 methylaniline, N methyl N ethylaniline, N,N dimethyltoluidine and the like cyclic and bicyclic tertiary amines such as pyridine, collidine, quinoline, isoquinoline, 2,6 lutidine, 2,4lutidine, 1,5 diazabicyclo 4.3.0 nonene 5 DBN , 1,5diazabicyclo 5.4.0 undecene 5 DBU , triethylenediamine and the like and polymeric tertiary amine bases such as the copolymer formed from divinylbenzene and vinylpyridine described by Hallensleben and Wurm in Anew.

Pyridine is a preferred tertiary amine base.The Cephalosporin Sulfoxide The present process can be applied generally to the reduction of any of wide variety of known cephalosporin sulfoxides. Representative of cephalosporin sulfoxides which can be reduced to the corresponding cephalosporin compounds are cephalosporin sulfoxides of the formulaEMI36.1 wherein R1, R2, R3, Rl and Y are as defined above.To the extent that there are no unprotected amino or non enolic hydroxy groups on these stating materials, the nature of the variables R1, R2, R3 and Y are not critical. The groups R1, R2, R3 and Y are typically not affected by the present process. Of course as with most other chemical processes the yields of cephalosporin products from the present process will vary from one cephalosporin to another. halide products of the reactions depicted in Schemes II and III can be isolated or converted by known procedures alcoholysis via imino ether to the corresponding nucleus estersEMI37.1 respectively. XXI In the reduction enol halogenation illustrated by Scheme I above, a 3 halo cephalosporin is prepared by reacting a 3 hydroxy cephalosporin sul oxide with about 2 to about 3 equivalents of the triaryl phosphite halogen kinetic complex in the presence of at least 1 molar equivalent of a scavenger in a substantially anhydrous inert organic solvent at a temperature of about 300C or below. With reference to Scheme II above, representing another embodiment of the present invention, cephalosporin imino halides are prepared by reacting 7acylamino cephalosporin sulfoxides with about 2 to about 3 equivalents of the triaryl phosphite halogen kinetic complexes in the presence of at least 1 equivalent of a halogen scavenger and about 1.0 to about 2.0 equivalents of a tertiary amine base in a substantially anhydrous organic solvent at a temperature of about 300C or below. Scheme III above represents a preferred embodiment of the present invention wherein a 3halocephalosporin imino halide is prepared by reacting Scheme I Reduction Enol halogenationEMI38.1 Scheme II Reduction Imino halogenationEMI38.2 Scheme III Reduction Enol halogenation Imino halogenationEMI38.3 In the above formulas R is a carboxy protecting group and R1, R2, R3, R7, X and Y are as defined hereinabove, provided that when Y is a radical of the formulaEMI38.4 A is not hydroxy. The imino The triaryl phosphite halogen complexes utilized as reducing agents in the present process are also potent halogenating agents. They can be used to convert both enolic hydroxy groups to the corresponding vinyl chlorides and, in the presence of base, amido groups to the corresponding imino halides. The multiple reactivity of the triaryl phosphite halogen kinetic complexes is exploited in each of embodiments of the present invention. Thus, the present invention is also directed to the reduction halogenation of cephalosporin sulfoxides. These additional aspects of the present invention are illustrated and summarize by reaction schemes I II thermodynamically unstable triaryl phosphite halogen complex and the product cephalosporins is the main considerations in avoiding selection of higher reaction temperatures.Of course, if the triaryl phosphitehalogen complex has been stabilized in solution with a tertiary amine base as described hereinabove, the upper temperature range for the present process becomes a less critical variable higher temperatures could easily be employed without significant loss of the reducing agent and without detriment to the reduction itself. Typically the reduction embodiment of the process is carried out simply by adding the cephalosporin sulfoxide either as a solid or in solution to a mixture of the triaryl phosphite halogen complex about 1 to about 1.3 molar equivalents per equivalent of sulfoxide and a halogen scavenger about 1 to about 3 molar equivalents per equivalent of sulfoxide in an inert organic solvent at the desired temperature. The course of the reaction can be followed, for example, by comparative thin layer chromatography. The reduction is usually complete after about 30 minutes to about 2 hours under preferred reaction conditions. Isolation and purification of the product cephalosporins can be accomplished by conventional laboratory techniques including, for example, extraction, crystallization and recrystallization, filtration, and trituration.The cephalosporin products are known compounds and useful as antibiotics after removal of protecting groups or as intermediates to other cephalosporin compounds. dynamically unstable halogenating agent and the product imino halides is the main considerations in avoiding selection of higher reaction temperatures. Of course, if the halogenating agent has been stabilized in solution with a tertiary amine base as described hereinabove, the upper temperature range for the present process becomes a less critical variable higher temperature could easily be employed without significant loss of the halogenating agent and without detriment to the halogenation process itself. The reduction embodiment of the process of the present invention is conducted in a substantially anhydrous inert organic solvent. Such solvents have been described and exemplified above in the description o the triaryl phosphite halogen complexes. Preferred solvents for the present process are hydrocarbons, especially aromatic hydrocarbons and halogenated hydrocarbons. Halogenated hydrocarbons other than chloroform are more preferred. Methylene chloride is most preferred. This embodiment is usually carried out at a temperature of about 30 C. or below. Preferably it is conducted at a temperature of about 1000 or below.Usually it is not conducted at a temperature less than about 50 C. Most preferred is a temperature range of about 0 to about 300C. It should be noted that the reduction embodiment of the process of the present invention can be conducted at temperatures above 300C and below 50 C. The freezing point of the reaction medium, substrate solubility and reaction rates are possible limiting factors at low temperatures while stability of the or below. A reaction temperature of about 100 or below is more preferred. Usually the present processes are not conducted at a temperature below about 70 C. Most preferred is a reaction temperature of about 10 to about 700C. It should be noted that the present chlorination processes can be conducted, although not advantageously, at temperatures above 300 and below 70e. The freezing point of the reaction medium and substrate solubility are limiting factors at low temperatures while the ability of the thermodynamically unstable halogenating agent is the main consideration in selection of higher reaction temperatures. Of course, if the halogenating agent has been stabilized in solution with a tertiary amine base as described hereinabove, the upper temperature range for the present process becomes even a less critical variable higher temperatures could easily be employed without significant loss of the halogenating agent and without detriment te the halogenation process itself. The imino halide forming embodiment of the present process is usually carried out at a temperature of about 30 C. or below. Preferably the present process is conducted at a temperature of about 00. or below and more preferably at about ioDc. or below. Usually the process is not conducted at a temperature less than about 700C. Most preferred is a temperature range of about 100 to about 700C. It should be noted that the imino halide forming embodiment of the process of the present in Invention can be conducted at temperatures above 30 and below 700. The freezing point of the reaction medium and substrate solubility are possible limiting factors at low temperatures while stability of the thermo protecting groups such as those described by E. Haslam in Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, supra,Chapter 5, shall be recognized as suitable. The nature of such ester forming groups is not critical. In the foregoing definitions hydroxy, amino and carboxy protecting groups are not exhaustively defined. The function of such groups is to protect the reactive function groups during the present process and then be removed at some later point in time without disrupting the remainder of the molecule. Many protecting groups are known in the art, and the use of other protecting groups not specifcally referred to hereinabove are equally applicable to the substrates used in the processes of the present invention. The triphenyl phosphite halogen complexes Z H are the preferred halogenating agents in the halogenation processes of this invention. The triphenyl phosphite chlorine kinetic complex is most preferred for the present processes. For the enolhalogenation process, best results are seen when about 1.1 to about 1.2 equivalent of halogenating reagent are used for each equivalent of enol substrate. For the combination enol halogenation imino halogenation process, preferably about 2.2 to about 2.4 equivalents, and most preferably about 2.3 equIvalents, of halogenating compounds are employed for each equivalent of enol substrate.The Reaction Conditions The halogenation processes of this invention are preferably carried out at a temperature of about 0 The term protected hydroxy has reference to the readily cleavable groups formed with an hydroxyl group such as the formyloxy group, the chloroacetoxy group, the benzyloxy group, the benzhydryloxy group, the trityloxy group, the 4 nit obenzyloxy group, the trimethylsilyloxy group, the phenacyloxy group, the tert butoxy group, the methoxymethoxy group, the tetrahydropyranyloxy group, and the like. Other hydroxy protecting groups, including those described byC. B. Reese in Prctective Groups in Organic Chemistry, supra, Chapter 3 shall be considered as within the term protected hydroxy as used herein. The term carboxylic acid protecting group has reference te the commonly used carboxylic acid protecting groups employed to biock or protect the carboxylic acid functionality while reactions involving other functional sites of the compound are carried out.Such carboxy protecting groups are noted for their ease of cleavage by hydrolytic or b hydrogenolytic methods to the corresponding carboxylic acid. Examples of carboxylic acid ester protecting groups include methyl, tert butyl, benzyl, 4 methoxybenzyl, C2 C6 alkanoyloxymethyl, 2 iodoethyl, 4 nitrobenzyl, diphenylmethyl benzhydryl , phenacyl, 4 halophenacyl, dimethylallyl, 2,2,2 trichloroethyl, tri Cl C3 alkyl silyl, succinimido methyl and like ester forming moieties. In addition to ester protection of carboxy groups, such groups can also be protected as the mixed anhydride, such as that formed with acetyl chloride, propionyl chloride, isobutyryl chloride and like acid chlorides in the presence of a tertiary amine base.Other known carboxy EMI45.1 wherein A is as defined above. When cephalosporin carboxylic acids are employed in the present process yields are typically lower because the kinetic complex reacts not only with the sulfoxide moiety but also with the carboxy group to form the corresponding acid halide which, under normal product isolation procedures, is hydrolyzed to the acid. Preferably, the C 4 carboxy function of the cephalosporin sulfoxide is protected prior to its reduction in the present process. To increase the reduction yields when cephalosporln sulfoxide acids are employed in the present process an additional equivalent of the kinetic complex can be used. A aqueous work up of the reaction mixture will allow the corresponding cephalosporin acid te be isolated. The term protected amino as employed in the above definition has reference to an amino group substituted with one of the commonly employed amino blocking groups such as the tert butoxycarbonyl group t BOC the benzyloxycarbonyl group, the 4 methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl group, the 4 nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl group, the 2,2,2 trichloroethoxycarbonyl group, or the l carbomethoxy 2 propenyl group formed with methyl acetoacetate. Like amino protecting groups such as those described by J.W. Barton in Protective Groups inOrganic Chemistry, J. G. W. McOmie, Ed., Plenum Press,New York, N.Y., 1973, Chapter 2, shall be recognized as suitable. The sulfoxides employed in this process embodiment have been described in U.S. patents. With reference to the above formula XII, the compounds wherein A is C1 C4 alkoxy carbonyl or C2 C6 haloalkoxy carbonyl are described by Spry in U.S. Patent No.3,953,436. The 3 hydroxy 3 cephem sulfoxides and 3exomethylenecepham sulfoxides are described by Chauvette in U.S. Patent No. 3,917,587, and by Kukolja in U.S.Patent No. 4,052,387. Those sulfoxides wherein A isC1 C4 alkanesulfonyloxy or a phenyl or substituted phenylsulfonyloxy group are prepared by the method disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,985,737. The 2methyl 3 cephems are described in the Journal of theAmerican Chemical Society, 97, 5020 1975 and 98, 2342 1976 . Further, Cooper described a generally applicable method for the synthesis of cephalosporin sulfoxides in U.S. Patent No. 3,647,786. A preferred group of cephalosporin sulfoxides in the present process are those of the above formula wherein. R is a carboxylic acid protecting group R1 is hydrogen R2 is hydrogen and R3 is an acyl group of the formula R7CO wherein R7 is an aryl alkyl group of the formula R Q m CQ1Q2 wherein RO is 2 thienyl, phenyl or sub stituted phenyl, Q is O, m is 1 or 0, and Q1 and Q2 are hydrogen and Y is a divalent radical of the formula a acyrino 3 hydroxy cephalosporin with about 3 to about 5 equivalents of the triaryl phosphite halogen complexes in the presence of at least 1 equivalent of a halogen scavenger and about 2 to about 5 equivalents of a tertiary amine base in a substantially anhydrous inert organic solvent at a temperature of about 30 C or below.Best results for the Scheme III process have been observed when about 4.4 equivalents of triphenyl phosphite chlorine kinetic complex and about 3.8 equivalents of pyridine are employed to each equivalent of 7 aclamino 3 hydroxycephalosporin sulfoxide starting material using methylene chloride as a solvent. The multi effect single step process embodi ments of the present invention illustrated in SchemesI III above are conducted under essentially the same conditions detailed hereinabove for the general reduction of cephalosporin sulfoxides using triaryl phosphite halogen complexes. Except for the particular structural requirements for the cephalosporin sulfoxide reactants, the requirement for the presence of a tertiary amine base in the processes of Schemes II andIII, and the stoichiometry unique to the individual multi conversion processes, all reaction parameters for the multi conversion processes of Schemes I III are identical to those described for the basic process of this invention. This includes the aforedescribed temperature ranges, solvents, triaryl phosphitehalogen kinetic complexes, halogen scavengers and preferences therefor. The cephalosporin products of the present processes can be isolated and purified by conventional laboratory techniques including, for example, extraction, crystallization and recrystallization, and trituration.Because the imino halide products are sensitive to acid catalyzed alcoholysis or hydrolysis and to nucleophilic attack, some precaution should be taken during product isolation to avoid exposing the products to conditions under which such reactions of the imino halide might take place. For example, under neutral conditions achieved by maintaining 2 concentration of a nonnucleophilic acid scavenger such as propylene oxide, solutions of the imino halide products can be washed with water and brine and evaporated, usually under reduced pressure, to provide the product in substantially pure form. Since the primary utility of the imino halide products is as intermediates to the correspondingC 7 aminocephalosporins, preferably the imino halide products of the present process are reacted without isolation from the reducing haloenating reaction mixture with an excess of a Cl Cls aliphatic alcohol or more preferably a B disubstituted primary aliphatic alcohol or a 1,2 or 1, 3 diol to provide the corresponding nucleus esters. The improved alcoholysis of cephem imino halides via an imino ether intermediate using 5 disubstituted aliphatic alcohols and 1,2 or 1,3diols to provide cephem nucleus esters is disclosed inU.S. Patents 3,845,043. Preferred for imino etherification and subsequent alcoholysis of the imino halide products are a 12 ss disubstituted primary aliphatic alcohol, aC3 C15 aliphatic 1,3 diol, or a C2 C12 aliphatic 1,2diol. Suitable 8 disubstituted primary aliphatic alcohols are those compounds of the formulaEMI49.1 wherein each of Rx and Ry is an alkyl group such that the 5 disubstituted primary aliphatic alcohol has from 4 to about 12 carbon atoms or Rx and Ry are taken together with the carbon atom to which they are bonded to form a cycloalkyl group having from 5 to 8 carbon atoms. Exemplary of such alcohols are isobutanol, 2 methylbutanol, 2 ethylbutanol, 2ethylhexanol, hydroxymethylcyciopentane, hydroxymethylcyclohexane, 2 n butyloctanol, 2 n propylhexanol and like alcohols.Suitable 1,2 or 1,3diols are those of the formulaEMI49.2 respectively wherein Rc and Rd are hydrogen or alkyl such that the 1,2 diol has from 2 to 12 carbon atoms and wherein Rw and Rz are each hydrogen, methyl or ethyl, and each of Re and Rf is hydrogen or a hydrocarbon moiety such that the 1,3 diol has from 3 to 15 carbon atoms. Representative of 1,2 diols are 1,2propylene glycol, 2,3 butanediol, 1,2 butanediol, 3,4 pentanediol, and 3,4 hexanediol.Representative of 1,3 diols are 1,3 propanediol, 1,3 butanediol, 1, 3 pentanediol, 2,2 dimethyl 1,3 propanediol, 2,2 diethyl 1,3 propanediol, 2,4 pentanediol, and 2,2 diphenyl 1,3 propanediol. Most preferred of alcohols or diols for cleavage of the imino halide products of the present process are isobutanol, 1,2 propanediol and 1, 3 propanediol. An excess of the alcohol or diol is employed for cleavage of the imino halide products of the process of the present invention. The amount of excess alcohol or diol is not critical. When the aforedescribed 1,2 or 1,3 diols are employed about a 2 3 fcld excess will suffice. When a ti disub stituted primary aliphatic alcohol is employed about a 3 6 fold excess is usually preferred. Of course larger amounts of the alcohol or diol may be employed without affecting the course of the reaction. Often a 10 15 fold excess of the preferred alcohol or diol is used. In general a 3 to 15 fold excess of alcohol or diol is preferred.When aliphatic alcohols other than those mentioned hereinabove as preferred are used te cleave the imino halide products of the present process, larger excesses, about 10 100 fold, are typically employed. Usually the alcohol or diol is simply added to the halogenating reaction mixture in which the imino chloride has been prepared in accordance with the process of the present invention. Alcoholysis of the imino halide via imino ether formation is acid catalyzed. The reaction mixture itself is usually acidic enough so that alcoholysis occurs upon alcohol or diol addition without the addition of acid to the reaction mixture.However, to enhance the rate of alcoholysis and therefore the rate of nucleus ester formation, the reaction mixture is preferably acidified with, for example, hydrogen chloride after the alcohol or diol has been added to the reaction mixture. This can be accomplished simply by bubbling HC1 gas into the reaction mixture for a short period of time.Other acids, organic and inorganic can, however, be employed. Typically at least about 1 equivalent of hydrogen chloride is added to the reaction mixture to promote nucleus ester formation. The product nucleus esters can be isolated often as their crystalline hydrochloride salts simply by filtering the crystallized product from the reaction mixture. Non crystalline nucleus esters produced in accordance with the present procedure can be isolated from the reaction mixture using con ventional laboratory techniques. Alternatively, the nucleus esters can be reacted acylated in solution, without being isolated. Acylation of the nucleus esters using well known laboratory procedures provides C acylamino cephalosporins esters which either can be deesterified to provide known antibiotic compounds or they can be used as intermediates for further chemical modification. Combining the aforedescribed reduction enol imino halogenation Scheme III above , using a triaryl phosphite chlorine complex, with subsequent alcoholysis of the resulting imino chloride constitutes an improved method of preparation of 7 amino3 chloro 3 cephem 4 carboxylic acid esters from the corresponding 7 acylamino 3 hydroxy 3 cephem 4 carboxylic acid ester sulfoxides. Prior to this invention the total 3 function conversion was effected eIther in 3 separate steps, that is reduction, chlorination and side chain cleavage or in two steps, either combining reduction and chlorination see U.S. Patent No. 3,115,643 with subsequent side chain cleavage or by combining chlorination and side chain cleavage after reduction of the sulfoxide entity, for example, using the method disclosed inU.S. Patent No. 4,044,002. With the discovery of the present process the reduction, chlorination and cleavage conversions can be effected in excellent yields in one reaction vessel without isolation of intermediates. The 3 halocephem nucleus esters are known compounds. They can be acylated using conventional acylation techniques and subsequently deesterified to provide known antibiotic compounds. Of particular significance is the utility of these nucleus ester intermediates in the preparation of 7 D 2 phenyl2 aminoacetamido 3 chloro 3 cephem 4 carboxylic acid, a relatively new and clinically significant antibiotic. In a preferred process embodiment of the present invention a 7 amino 3 chloro 3 cephem 4carboxylic acid ester hydrochloride of the formulaEMI52.1 is prepared by a reacting a 7 acylamino 3 hydroxy 3 cephem 4 carboxylic acid ester sulfoxide with about 4.0 to about 5.0 equivalents of the kinetically con trolled product of the reaction of equivalent amounts of triphenyl phosphite and chlorine in a substan tially anhydrous inert organic sol vent, in the presence of about 3.5 to about 4.0 equivalents of pyridine and about 1 to about 3 equivalents of a C2 C6 alkene in a substantially anhydrous inert organic solvent, at a temperature of about 100 to about 300C. b adding about 3 to about 15 equivalents of isobutanol, 1,3 propanediol or 1,2 propanediol to the reaction mixture after formation of the 3 chloro 3 cephem imino chloride is complete and c acidifying the reaction mixture with HC1. A most preferred inert organic solvent is methylene chloride. Preferred 3 hydroxy 3 cephem sulfoxide substrates are those bearing conventional penicillin and cephalosporin carboxamido groups at the C 7 position. A particularly preferred group of 3hydroxy 3 cephem sulfoxides are those bearing an acylamino group of the formula RO Q m CQ1Q2CONH wherein RO is 2 thienyl, phenyl or substituted phenyl, Q is 0, m is 1 or 0 and Q1 and Q2 are hydrogen. More preferred for economic reasons and not necessarily for reactivity are the C7 substituents phenylacetamido, phenoxyacetamido and 2thienylacetamido.Similarly the 4 nitrobenzyl group is a preferred carboxy protecting group in the preferred process embodiment because of the crystalline nature of the product hydrochloride, and therefore the ease of isolation of a product nucleus ester of high purity. The following examples are provided to further illustrate the present invention. It is not intended that this invention be limited in scope by reason of any cf these examples. In the following examples and preparations nuclear magnetic resonance spectra are abbreviated nmr. The nuclear magnetic resonance spectra were obtained on aVarian Associates T 60 Spectrometer using tetramethylsilane as the reference standard. The chemical shifts are expressed in o values in parts per million ppm and coupling constants J are expressed as Hz cycles per second .

Into 50 ml of methylene chloride at 150C.was bubbled chlorine gas while simultaneously 3.2 ml 12,3 mmol of triphenyl phosphite TPP was added dropwise to the solution. The chlorine and TPP were combined at such a rate that the faint yellow color of chlorine could be noted in the reaction mixture throughout the co addition. Near the end of the TPP addition, chlorine addition was discontinued. TPP was then added until the yellow color of the reaction mixture was dissipated. Additional chlorine and the remaining TPP were then added to the reaction mixture until the last drop of TPP dissipated the chlorine color. To the resulting solution of the prepared triphenyl phosphite chlorine kinetic complex TPP C at 15 C. was added 4.68 gm 10 mmol of 4 nitrobenzyl 7 phenylacetamido 3 methyl 3 cephem 4carboxylate and, dropwise over a period of 12 minutes, a solution of 1.01 ml 12.5 mmol of pyridine In 4 ml of methylene chloride.

The reaction mixture was stirred at 20 to 300C. for about 15 minutes after which time 2.1 ml of propylene oxide was added to the mixture to destroy any HC1 or excess chlorinating reagent remaining in the reaction mixture. After the reaction mixture was allowed to warm to approximately 0 C. over a 15 minute period, the solution was washed with 25 ml of ice water and dried over calcium chloride dihydrate.

Immediately a solution of 1.01 ml 12.5 mmol of pyridine in 4 ml of methylene chloride was added dropwise over a 15 minute period to the reaction mixture. After the reaction mixture was stirred for an additional 15 minutes at 10 to 150C., 2.1 ml of propylene oxide was added.The cooling bath was removed, and the temperature of the mixture was allowed to rise to about 0 over a 15 minute period after which time the reaction mixture was washed with 25 ml of ice water, dried over calcium chloride dihydrate and subsequently evaporated in vacuo to about 20 grams of a syrup. No crystals were observed after the addition of about 50 ml of diethyl ether to the product residue.
