# Torque readout sensor.

## Abstract
A torque readout sensor for mounting to a bolted interconnection between an aircraft brake assembly 26 and a brake reaction torque limiting apparatus 30 to sense the reaction torque upon the application of braking action comprises a metal body 100, 120, 130, 150 that replaces a bushing 54 at the bolted interconnection and configured such that a deflection of the body is accomplished in the direction of the reaction torque force and at least one pair of strain gauges 112, 126, 136, 156 are affixed to the body at the point of deflection to provide an output electrical signal calibrated to the amount of deflection and thus to the reaction torque experienced by the body.
