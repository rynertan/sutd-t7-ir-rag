## Description
Process and means for transforming liquid and solid waste and biodegradable mud slime into fertilizer, using earthworms.The invention described herein relates to a method and relative means by which to transform both solid and liquid waste and biodegradable muds into fertilizer, utilizing earthworms for the purpose a new process and contrivance in which earthworms or suitable annelids in general provide the vehicle by means of which to obtain mineral fertilizer for agricultural use, this in the guise of excrement passed from solid urban waste, liquid livestock waste, residual slime from water purification, waste produced by foodstuffs, paper and textile factories all such waste and refuse etca being of a biodegradable nature.The prior art takes in a method of transforming such waste wherein earthworms are laid out on the ground in s nta or heaps to a maximum depth of 50 centimetres whereupon refuse muddy waste in particular is duly rained onto the worms and the area protected by a cover sheet of canvas or the liken The depth of such layers may not be increased as heat given off during fermentation of solid or miry slightly dilute organic waste heaped thus deeper would destroy the worms by overheating the worms demise would be brought on equally effectively by suffocation due to fumes given off by fermentation proper within the simta, there being little oxygen available as a rule the depth increase would be unproductive moreover, as worms would tend to occupy the upper 5 to 10 cm of the layer in greater number driven thence by the need for necessary oxygen and fail to work on a cost effective amount of refuse lastly, cold will also kill off earthworms should the layer be insufficiently deep as to produce a temperature of below OCO, indeed the process of conversion 31ready falls off in effectiveness below 50C, The prior art thus illustrated stands in need of improvement with regard to the following aspects the need for an increased de pth of earthworm strata by means of which to economize on surface area demanded by the process the need for extraction of fertilizer from the lower region of the heap by mechanical means thus obviating the necessity for employing skilled labour and special equipment operatives being hard to find due to the somewhat hazardous hygiene conditions a more rational system of introducing refuse of whatever kind solid, liquid or mud into the mass of worms creation of an environment in which the worms may su6sist whilst working with the greatest possible efficiency viz, by avoiding overheating within the mass, and guarding against lack of oxygen, stagnation of fumes and temperature drop below 50C in addition the need for dispensing both with dead time and with exposure of operatives to fumes and to pathogenic agents in the refuse itself,The foregoing outline demonstrates the need for a solution to the technical problem posed by an earthworm medium conver sicn process capable of transforming any kind of biodegradable organic waste more rapidly, more profitable, with grater economy and in enhanced conditions of hygiene.The invention resolves the above techinal problemby adopting an erthworm medium conversion process which makes provision for inteduction of air into the mass of worms and extraction th from of suffocation inducing fumes diffusion of water through the said mass in order to avoid overheating uniform distribution of worms throughout the mass of liquid, mud or solid waste pro t ection against low temperatures automatically operated extraction of fertilizer from the mass lower region the process being achieved in a continuous cycle with no. need whatever for specialized personnel, and to that end employing a contrivance wherein earthworms and organic refuse are deposited in an open top silo of up to ten metres or more in height containing all such tubes as are necessary to introduction and distribution of mud and or liquid waste, air and water as well as meons for agitation thereof, solid refuse being simply dropped thereinto from above evacuation of fumes being brought about by an arrange ment of perimeter gri 1 1 es and suction and outlet chambers the lower region of the silo tapered and terminating in a fast discharge orifice whence an akernating tray system despatches fertilizer onto a conveyor belt, Advantages furnished by te invention are drastic reduction in ground area requirement br waste to fertilizer process of the kind, by virtue of the vertically expanded design introduction of waste and extraction of fertilizer brought about at speed even distribution of earthworms throughout the mass of refuse due to diffusion of cooling water and oxygen therein and to removal of fermentation fumes threfrom, giving rise to a fertilizer porduction rate of some hundred or two hundred percent or more with respect to the traditional method as per the prior art elimination of dead time marked reduction in labour downgrading of operatives
