# METHODS AND APPARATUS FOR MAKING ICE AND SNOW

## Abstract
Methods and apparatus for making ice and snow are disclosed. Ice 13,15 is made by freezing water at an ambient atmospheric temperature at or below the freezing point of water by depositing, suitably by intermittent spraying through nozzles 9,11 , water from a pipe 1 on a surface 5,7 at a rate substantially equal to or less than the maximum rate of crystallization of said water on the surface 5,7 . To form the ice into snow the ice is comminuted by a device 33 which travels along the surface 5,7 . A blower 67 may be used to blow the snow so formed over the ski slope.
