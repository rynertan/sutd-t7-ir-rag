## Description
Apparatus for preparing hot drinks.Apparatus for preparing hot drinks comprising an open boiler having R ogld water supply pipe and a dispensing pipe with a dispensing pipe part to be vertically arranged for dispensing a batch of hot water, an apparatus for preparing drinks, wherein the dispensing pipe dispenses hot water from the boiler, a heating element in the boiler with an adjustable means for determining the energy supply to the element, an open buffer vessel for supplied cold atcr, the bottom of said vessel being at a level above the lower end of the dispensing pipe part where this is connected with the boiler, a sensing member in the buffer vessel reacting to a water level corresponding with a considerable part of the height of the buffer vessel, and an adjustable inlet valve in the cold water supply pipe, adjustment of the energy supply means and the inlet valve respectively being controlled by the sensing member.Such an apparatus is know from Swiss patent specification 255 368. In the known apparatus the sensing member is a float in the open buffer vessel, said float defining the position of tho inlet valve being shut off as soon as the water level in tke buffer vessel is reaching the height wanted for the proper operation of the boiler, viz. the water level at which the boiling water boils over via the dispensing pipe to the anparatus for preparing drinks.The adjustable energy supply determination means is switching on the electrical heating element by means of a clock for a period predetermined by adjustment of said clock, as a result whereof the boiler is feeding a batch of hot water to the apparatus for preparing drinks. The amount of the batch is not accurately determined in this manner, which reduces the constancy of the quality of the portions of hot drink prepared with successive batches of hot water. The real voltage value with which the heating element is fed, the prevailing atmospheric pressure and the temperature of the cold water supply belong to the factors influencing the amount of the batch. Also scale deposit on the heating element and in the boiler respectively is such a factor.The invention has the purpose to eliminate said factors.According to the invention an apparatus of the type described in the introduction is characterized by an open water tank, wherein the cold water supply pipe is feeding and being provided with a discharge pipe to the buffer vessel, in which discharge pipe an adjustable outlet valve is incorporated and further comprising a second sensing member for signalling a water filling level, and by a control device for the inlet valve, the outlet valve and the energy supply determination means which control device is closing the inlet valve, is opening the outlet valve and is causing the energy supply determination means to supply the energy as soon as the water in the water tank has risen to the second sensing member and reverse as soon as the water in the buffer vessel is lowered to the first sensing member.An advantage of the apparatus according to the invention is that the heating element in the boiler can be continuously switched on during the preparation of a batch of the hot drink which is larger than the contents of the water tank. The fact is that the contents of the buffer vessel can be selected sufficiently large to feed cold water to the boiler retaining its operation, viz. the boiling over, when automatically refilling the water tank.Preferably the control device comprises an adjustment means with which the number of times can be adjusted that the lowering of the water level to the first sensing member is not signalled to the energy supply determination means, so that the size of the batch can be determined easily.As a construction an embodiment of the apparatus is especially advantageous, wherein the buffer vessel and the water tank respectively are compartments of one single vessel with one single partition wall reaching to the bottom of the vessel. The fact is that the water tank, the buffer vessel and the boiler can have a relatively small volume as a result of the electrical heating element being semi continuously switched on, its switching on and off being an inconvenient load of the mains. In principle the switching on and off of the valves connected with the water tank is also such an inconvenient load, but in proportion it is a much lesser inconvenient load due to the electrical power consumption of the valves. The invention will hereafter be elucidated with a description of two embodiments.Fig. 1 shows a schematical illustration of an apparatus according to the invention.Fig. 2 shows a schematical illustration of an advantageous embodiment of the apparatus shown in fig. 1.In fig. 1 a supply pipe is feeding through nozzle 2 cold water to a water tank 3. In the bottom of the water tank 3 a discharge pipe 4 with a nozzle 5 is mounted, through which discharge pipe water can flow from the water tank to a buffer vessel 6, in the bottom of which a cold water pipe 7 is connected which extends below in the side of an open boiler 8. On top of the boiler 8 there is a dispensing pipe comprising a vertically arranged part 9 and a dispensing nozzle 10. The apparatus for preparing hot drinks further comprises a device for preparing the hot drink wherein via the dispensing pipe the water boilingover from the boiler is dispensed. This device with accessories is not shown in fig. 1.In the supply pipe 1 an inlet valve 11 is present and in the discharge pipe 4 an ou tlet valve 12 is present. The two valves 11 and 12 are electrically controlled by a control device 13. In the water tank 3 a sensing member 16 is present with which a eertain water filling level of the tank via line 17 can be signalled to the control device 13.In the buffer vessel 6 a second sensing member 18 is present for signalling via line 19 a water filling level in the buffer vessel to the control device 13. The water tank 3 is positioned fully above the buffer vessel 6, the bottom of said vessel being at a level above the lower end of the dispensing pipe part 9 where this is connected with the boiler 8.The inlet valve 11 is provided with a control means 20 connected via a line 21 with the control device 13. The outlet valve 12 in a similar manner is provided with an electrical control means 22 connected via line 23 with the control device 13.In the boiler 8 an electrical heating element 27 is present that is connected via an on off switch 26 to the mains 28.The switch 26 is provided with an electrical control means 24 that is connected via line 25 to the control device 13. The apparatus is operated as follows.The amount of boiling water to be delivered by the boiler 8, is adjusted beforehand by means of an adjustment means 14 connected with the control device via an electrical line 15This amount is determined in the example described here by the contents of the water tank 3 up to the sensing member 16, said contents functioning as a unit batch.In starting the apparatus the water level in the buffer vessel 6 generally corresponds with the sensing member 18.The control device will switch on the heating element through the switch 26 no sooner than that the water level in the water tank 3 has appeared to correspond with the sensing member 16. The heating element 27 in the boiler 8 continues to be switched on via the switch 26 until the moment whereupon the number of cycles for filling the water tank 3 and its emptying adjusted by the adjustment means 14 is performed.Tn fig. 2 another embodiment of the apparatus shown in fig. 1 is proposed. The water tank in this embodiment is a compartment 31 of a vessel 60, said compartment being separated from the buffer vessel 61 by a partition wall 62.The compartments 31 and 61 communicate through orifices in the bottom by a discharge pipe consisting of parts 41 and 51, the outlet valve 12 being arranged between said parts 41 and 51. Otherwise this embodiment of an apparatus according to the invention is identical to the embodiment proposed in fig. 1. This is the reason why the boiler 8 with the dispensing pipe 9, 10 is not shown in fig. 2.The position of the vessel 60 is similar to that of the buffer vessel 6 in fig. 1, that is to say that the bottom is at a level above the lower end of the dispensing pipe part 9 where this is connected with the boiler 8. The unit of volume with which the batch of boiling water for preparing a hot drink is dispensed, is determined in this embodiment by the height difference between the sensing members 16 and 18. In the embodiment according to fig. 2 the first sensing member 18 can advan .ageously be transferred to the water tank 31 resulting in that fluctuations of the water surface in the buffer vessel 61 which develop because of the open connection via the cold water pipe 7 with the boiler 8, and which due to the presence of the cold water pipe 7, are already a slight reproduction of fluctuat ions of the water level in the dispensing pipe part 9, are still further damped, which adds to the accuracy of measuring the cold water fed to the water tank 31. In the first embodiment according to fig. 1 the water tank 3 is mounted entirely free of the buffer vessel 6 and fluctuations of the water level around the sensing member 18 do not play a role.
