The term t C1 C2 alkoxy refers to the aliphatic radicals of one to two carbon atoms attached to the remainder of the molecule by an oxygen atom, such as methoxy, and methoxy The term halo refers to bromo, chloro, fluoro, and iodo. Preparation of Ureas of Formula IX The process for making the 3 aryl 5 isothiazolyl ureas of formula IX is outlined in the following schematic EMI8.1 formula IX where R2 C1 C3 alkyl wherein R, RÚ, and R are defined as above, and Rê is C1 C3 alkyl R4is C1 C6 alkyl or phenyl V is chloro or bromo X is nitrate, acetate, formate, bromide, chloride, or fluoride and Y is bromo, chloro, fluoro, or iodo. A substituted ester of. formula I is converted to the ketonitrile of formula II using acetonitrile and a base. The ketonitrile of formula II is then treated with ammonia or an ammonium salt ammonia mixture to form the aminonitrile of formula III. Subsequently, thiation of this aminonitrile of formula III is completed using hydrogen sulfide. Upon thiation a thioamide of formulaIV is formed, which is then oxidized to facilitate ring closure, resulting in the 3 substituted 5 aminoisothiazole of formula V. Once the isothiazole of formula V is formed, it is reacted with a halogenated phenylformate, usually chloro, to generate a carbamate intermediate of formulaVI. This intermediate of formula VI is subsequently aminated to produce the desired urea compound of formulaVII. Alternatively, the urea compound of formulaVII can be made from a the reaction of a 5 aminoisothiazole of formula V and the appropriate alkylisocyanate in an inert organic solvent or from b the reaction of the isothiazole of formula V with phosgene to form an isocyanate and then reacting the isocyanate with the appropriate amine or from c the reaction of a 5 aminoisothiazole of formula V with a carbamoyl halide. A certain group of urea compounds of formulaVII, such as the N methyl N methoxy derivatives of formula VIIA, can be prepared by the alkylation of the corresponding hydroxyl urea. Other, more substituted ureas of formula VIII can also be prepared from already made ureas of formulaeVII and VIIA by alkylation. Compound I Ester Compound I, the substituted ester, can be obtained by methods well knowrv in the art. These include the preparation of the ester from the corresponding phenyl carboxylic acid,EMI10.1 whereinR3 and n are defined above, and the appropriate alco hol, R4OH, wherein 4 is defined above1 under acidic conditions. Typical acids used include concentrated sulfuric acid, dry hydrogen chloride, and boron trifluoride etherate, with boron trifluoride etherate preferred. Preferred alcohols are methanol and ethanol, wherein R is methyl or ethyl, with the most preferred being methanol. The resulting preferred ester will be the methyl carboxylate. Preferred carboxylic acid 3 groups, R3 are listed above.Usually, to shift the equilibrium toward the ester, a large excess of alcohol is used with elevated temperatures, but the temperature can be from about ambient temperature to about the reflux temperature of the alcohol. Alternatively, the ester can be removed upon formation. A more preferred preparation of the ester involves using the corresponding acid chloride,EMI11.1 and the appropriate alcohol, R40H. Esterification of the acid chloride is often carried out in the presence of a base, such as pyridine, aqueous sodium hydroxide, or others, under conditions described as the Schotten Baumann technique. However, sometimes the use of the above listed bases is unnecessary. Typically, the acid chloride is prepared from its carboxylic acid using thionyl chloride, phosphorus oxychloride, oxalyl chloride, or phosphorus pentachloride. Acid anhydrides can also undergo alcoholysis to form an ester, as do the acid chlorides. The process called transesterification allows conversion of one ester to another, catalyzed by acidic or basic conditions. The acid can be concentrated sulfuric acid, dry hydrogen chloride, and the like, while the base can be an alkoxide ion, and the like.To shift the equilibrium to form the new ester, a large excess of the appropriate alcohol is used or the desired ester is removed upon formation. The intermediates of formula I can be isolated, if desired, by typical techniques, such as extraction or recrystallization. However, isolation is not necessary when an intermediate is going to be used in a following reaction. Compound I is typically isolated by being washed with water and then extracted with ether and dried over magnesium sulfate. Compound II Ketonitrile The ketonitrile, compound II, is formed from the substituted ester of formula I using a base condensation reaction with acetonitrile. The base present can be sodium metal, sodium ethoxide, sodium methoxide, sodium hydride, and the like. Sodium hydride is the base of choice and is usually dispersed in mineral oil.The substituted ester of formula I is allowed to react with from about one to about two equivalents of acetonitride in the presence of the base and a solvent at the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture. The reaction continues for a time sufficient to bring about substantial completion, usually from about 4 hours to about 24 hours. Suitable solvents include tetrahydro furan THF , ether, toluene, benzene, ethanol, methanol, and the like, with THF the preferred solvent. A preferred method for preparing Compound II is slurrying sodium hydride in THF and then adding the appropriate ester and acetonitrile, while the slurry is maintained at a temperature from about 60 to about 650C. After the addition is complete, the mixture is heated to reflux for about 16 to about 24 hours. The intermediates of formula II can be isolated, if desired, by typical techniques. The ketonitrile, Compound II, is formed in the reaction mixture as the sodium salt. Then the solvent is removed in vacuo before the salt is dissolved in water. Any residual mineral oil is washed out with hexane, and the free ketonitrile is obtained by acidifying with a mineral acid, such as hydrochloric acid and the like, and extracting into ether. Any necessary crystallization can be done with ethanol, methylene chloride, cyclohexane, hexane, toluene, or appropriate mixtures thereof. Compound III Aminonitrile Once the ketonitrile of formula II is formed, it can be converted to the aminonitrile, Compound III, by using a source of ammonia. Using ammonia under pressure provides a source of ammonia, with the pressure being generated by the reaction itself run in a sealed vessel. The reaction is heated at temperatures from about 100 to about 1500C for anywhere from about 4 to about 24 hours. Preferably, the reaction is conducted at about l500C for about 16 hours. Although an organic solvent can be used in the reaction, such as ethanol, benzene, toluene, methanol, THF, and the like, with ethanol being preferred, such a solvent is not essential to the reaction. It is, however, necessary to use at least one equivalent of ammonia, but an excess of ammonia can be used if desired. The preferred source of ammonia utilizes an ammonium salt and ammonia under atmospheric pressure at temperatures from about ambient temperature to about the reflux temperature of the solvent used. The ketonitrile, Compound II, is mixed in an inert organic solvent that already contains the ammonium salt. Typical solvents include ethanol, methanol, THF, and the like, with ethanol being preferred. Typical ammonium salts include ammonium chloride, ammonium bromide, ammonium acetate, ammonium formate, ammonium nitrate, and the like, with ammonium nitrate being preferred, but, ammonium sulfate cannot be used. The amount of ammonium salt can be varied and an excess can be used however, it is preferable to use less than or equal to one equivalent of the salt in the reaction.The resulting mixture of solvent and ammonium salt is then warmed to the desired temperature, which is usually the reflux temperature of the solvent, and ammonia is bubbled in.The reaction runs from about 4 to about 24 hours, with the preferred time being from about 16 to 24 hours. Alternatively, Compound II may be reacted with one to two equivalents of ammonia with an ammonium salt added, all under pressure, at a temperature of about 25 to about 800C for about 4 to about 24 hours. A more preferred method of preparing CompoundIII uses ammonium nitrate as the desired ammonium salt, uses ethanol as the solvent, and is run for about 16 hours at the reflux temperature of ethanol, which is about 800 C. Another route to Compound III is described in the literature see Netherlands Patent 6,608,094,J. Prakt. Chem., 52, 110 1895 , and J. Med. Chem., 18, 441 1975 . This route involves reacting acetonitrile with an appropriate base, such as sodium metal, sodium hydride, or sodium amide in the presence of an aromatic nitrile. After condensation occurs and the reaction is treated with water, Compound III is isolated upon work up. Compound III, the aminonitrile, can be isolated, if desired, by removing the excess ammonia and solvent in vacuo, and then extracting with hexane, methylene chloride, ethyl acetate, ether, and the like.The mixture containing the product can also be dried over magnesium sulfate, and then recrystallized.Typical solvents used for crystallization are toluene, hexane, cyclohexane, and the like. Compound IV Thioamide Compound IV, a thioamide, can be made under pressure by following a procedure similar to that outlined in J. Goerdeler and H.W. Pohland, Chem. Ber., 94, 2950 1961 and British Patent 1,153,186 Netherlands Patent 6,608,094 . The aminonitrile, Compound III, is reacted with.hydrogen sulfide under pressure the pressure being generated by the reaction itself. This reaction is run in an organic solvent, such as methylene chloride, chloroform, and the like, with methylene chloride being preferred. A small amount of a base catalyst 0.5 2 is used to facilitate reaction and includes such bases as triethylamine and potassium hydroxide, with the latter preferred. The temperature of the reaction can be from about 25 to about 1000C, with about 600C being preferred, while the reaction can be allowed to continue from about 16 hours to about 72 hours, with about 48 hours being preferred. A more preferred method of making the thioamide of formula IV with hydrogen sulfide utilizes a temperature at about 60 C for about 48 hours, with methylene chloride as the solvent, and potassium hydroxide as the catalyst. Alternatively, the thioamide of formula IV cari be prepared at atmospheric pressure by reacting the aminonitrile of formula III in an inert organic solvent such as pyridine, ethanol, toluene, benzene, and the like, pyridine being preferred, with hydrogen sulfide in the presence of a base catalyst, such as triethylamine.Typically, this type of reaction is run at a temperature from about 25 to about 1000C. Another route, even more preferred, involves using a phase transfer catalyst PTC at about one to two atmospheres of pressure atm , following a procedure similar to that outlined in L. Cassar, S. Panossian, and C. Giordano, Synthesis, 917 1978 . The aminonitrile of formula III is dissolved in an inert organic solvent, such as benzene, toluene, 1,2 dichlorobenzene, diphenyl ether, and the like. The use of a solvent can be avoided if a liquid aminonitrile is utilized. Then an aqueous solution of sulfide ion usually sodium sulfide nonahydrate is used to supply the sulfide ion and the PTC are added. The use of dilute aqueous sulfide solutions are preferred, allowing the reaction to proceed more rapidly. The mixture is then heated to about 35 800, preferably 700C, under an atmosphere of hydrogen sulfide at a pressure of about 1 2 atm for about 4 to about 48 hours. Typical PTCs include tetrabutyl ammonium chloride, tetrabutyl ammonium bromide, tricaprylmethylammonium chloride, dibenzo 18 crown 6, and the like. The preferred PTC is tetrabutylammonium chloride TBAC . The thioamide of formula IV, prepared by the first route, can be isolated, if desired, by removing the excess hydrogen sulfide and solvent and then crystallizing it from other solvents, such as ethanol, toluene, benzene, ethyl acetate, chloroform, hexane, and the like. Once the preparation of the thioamide is completed using the PTC or second route, the water layer is removed, and the organic layer is isolated. The product contained in the organic layer is precipitated, and can be recrystallized from solvents, such as methylene chloride, ether, benzene, hexane, ethyl acetate, and the like. Any excess solvent can be removed and or dried before the desired product is obtained. Compound V Isothiazole Ring closure of the thioamide of formula IV to form the isothiazole of formula V is facilitated by using an oxidizing agent, such as iodine, bromine, hydrogen peroxide, sodium hypochlorite, chloramine, chloramine T, chlorine, persalts such as potassium or ammonium persulfate, and the like. Preferred oxidizing agents are iodine and hydrogen peroxide. First, the thioamide is dissolved in an inert organic solvent, such as ether, benzene, ethanol water, and the like, and then the oxidizing agent is added. After cyclization of the thioamide of formulaIV, the isothiazole of formula V can be isolated, if desired, as follows. The organic layer containing the product can be dried and then the solvent removed. Crystallization can be done using toluene, ethanol, cyclohexane, acetone, hexane, methylene chloride, chloroform, ether, and mixtures thereof, and the like. When impure thioamide of formula IV is used in the cyclization step, the isothiazole product of formula V is best purified by extracting it from the organic solvent with a dilute mineral acid, washing the aqueous solution with an organic solvent, such as methylene chloride, and the like. The isothiazole of formula V is then freed with sodium or potassium hydroxide, and can be collected by filtration if it is a solid or it can be extracted into an inert organic solvent, such as methylene chloride and the like. Then the solution is dried and the solvent removed. Compound VI Carbamate The carbamate of formula VI is typically prepared from the 5 aminoisothiazole of formula V and a chloro or bromo phenylformate, in an inert organic solvent, such as toluene. In addition, an acid receptor, such as an inorganic or organic base, should be present to react with the hydrogen chloride formed as a byproduct. The preferred base to be used is pyridine. The carbamate, Compound VI, can be isolated, if desired, by recrystallization from typical solvents such as ethanol, acetone, and the like, with an ethanolwater mixture being preferred. Compound VII Urea The 3 aryl 5 isothiazolylureas of formula VII can be prepared from the carbamates of formula VI or directly from the 5 aminoisothiazoles of formula V. The preferred method of preparation is using the carbamate1Compound VI, which is dissolved in an inert organic solvent, such as dimethylformamide DMF , THF, , benzene, and the like, with benzene being the preferred solvent.Then the appropriately substituted amine of the formula HNRR1 is added and the entire reaction is run for about 1 2 to about 24 hours at a temperature from about 25 to about 1000C. The preferred reaction conditions are about 800C for about 1 hour. A tertiary amine, such as triethylamine, is added when the substituted amine is an amine salt or free methoxymethylamine. Certain ureas of formula VII, the N methyl Nmethoxy derivatives of formula VI IA, can be prepared by the alkylation of the N 3 substituted 5 isothiazolyl N hydroxyurea, using dimethyl sulfate. The hydroxyurea is generated from the appropriate carbamate of formulaVI and hydroxylamine in a process similar to.the process of forming ureas of formula VII from the carbamate of formula VI and substituted amine. Upon formation of the hydroxyurea, the dimethylsulfate is added to form the compounds of formula VI IA. Another preparation of Compound VII involves the reaction of a 5 aminoisothiazole of formula V with an alkylisocyanate of the formula RNCO. The reaction is run in an inert organic solvent, such as THF, benzene, ethyl acetate, and the like. Typically dibutyltin diacetate is added to the 5 aminoisothiazole of formula V and then the alkylisocyanate in solvent is added. The reaction is run at a temperature of from about 25 to about 1000C for about 1 2 to about 24 hours. The 5 aminoisothiazole of formula V can also be reacted with a compound of the formula COV2 whereinV is chloro or bromo, and then reacted with the substituted amine. Typically phosgene is used as the compound of formula COV2 and the isothiazole phosgene reaction is run in the presence of an acid of the formula HV with V being chloro or bromo . The reaction is carried out in an inert organic solvent, such as toluene, and the like, at elevated temperatures of from about 60 to about 1100C. The substituted amine is then added optionally in an inert organic solvent, such as toluene, chloroform, and the like and the reaction run at a temperature from about 0 to about 1000C. Another method of preparing the urea of formula VII is from the reaction of the 5 aminoisothiazole of formula V and a substituted cambamoyl halide of the formula, RR1NCOV. The halide is placed in pyridine or in an inert organic solvent, such as DMF,THF, benzene, and the like, with an acid acceptor, such as pyridine, present. Then the isothiazole of formula V is added and the reaction is run for about 1 to about 16 hours at a temperature from about 20 to about 600C.Preferably, the reaction is at about 250C for about 2 hours. The desired urea of formula VII is isolated, if desired, by removing the solvent under vacuum and extracting with dilute acids, such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, and the like. After the extract is washed, the solution is made basic with sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, and the like.The urea can be recrystallized from typical solvents, such as ethanol water, hexane, acetone, and the like, with ethanol water being preferred. Compound VIII R2 Alkyl substituted Ureas Additionally substituted ureas of formula VIII are prepared by an alkylation reaction between the unsubstituted urea of formula VII or VIIA and an alkyl halide of the formula R2 Y, when R2 is C1 C3 alkyl and wherein Y is bromo, chloro, fluoro, or iodo. The unsubstituted urea of formula VII or VIIA and alkyl halide are usually reacted in an inert organic solvent, such as DMF and the like, in the presence of a base, such as sodium hydride. The acid addition salts are formed from the reaction of the urea of formula VII, VIIA or VIII in an inert organic solvent, such as ether and the appropriate acid. The following examples are illustrative of the compounds of formula IX and the intermediates used in their preparation. All temperatures are in degreesCelsius and the melting points are uncorrected.

This means that the compound cannot be N 3 4 fluorophenyl 5 isothiazolyl3 N methyl N l methylethyl urea. More preferred compounds of formula IXA within this method are those in which R and R1 are C C4 alkyl or C1 C2 alkoxy, provided that one of R or R is methyl R2is hydrogen R3 is hydrogen, halo or methyl and n is 1. Even more preferred compounds of formula IXA are where R is C1 C4 alkyl RÚ is methoxy or methyl provided that one of R or RÚ is methyl and R is 4 fluoro The representative compounds of formula IXA are N 3 4 chlorophenyl 5 isothiazolyl N methyl N 1 methylethyl urea N 3 4 fluorophenyl 5 isothiazolyl N,Ndimethylurea N 3 4 bromophenyl 5 isothiazolyl N,Ndimethylurea N 3 4 chlorophenyl 5 isothiazolyl N,Ndimethylurea N 3 phenyl 5 isothiazolyl N,N dimethylurea N 3 4 methylphenyl 5 isothiazolyl N,Ndimethylurea N 3 4 fluorophenyl 5 isothiazolyl N ethyl N methylure a N 3 4 fluorophenyl 5 isothiazolyl Nmethoxy N methylurea and N 3 phenyl 5 isothiazolyl N methoxy Nmethylurea. The compounds of formula IXA have been evaluated in a standard aquatic algicide test designed to show algicidal activity. In a primary screen, the compounds were evaluated against Chlorella vulgaris,Scenedesmus guadricauda, Anacystis nidulans, Chlamvdomonas moewusii, Stichococcus bascillaris, Anabaena flos algae, Anabaena spiroides blue green , and Anabaena sp. 1551 . These algae species were grown on agar slants containing artificial media Hughes media .The agar slants were employed in the inoculation of the test media, which itself is an aqueous Hughes media.Five milliliters of sterile Hughes media was used to wash the agar slants, and this was then added to 400 ml of sterile Hughes media. Two milliliters of the inoculated media was then added to each of several 12 ml disposable vials. The test compounds of formula IXA were formulated for evaluation by dissolving 10 mg of compound in a solution of 0.5 ml of acetone and 4.5 ml of sterile 0.1 aqueous polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate Tween 80 . Aliquot portions 10 ml of the formulated test compounds were then added to the vials containing the algae species, Chlorella, Scenedesmus, Anacystis, andAnabaena flos aquae, for a 10 ppm screen. Compounds that were considered active at 10 ppm were tested using all of the algae species at concentrations of 1 ppm and 0.5 ppm. These compounds were formulated by adding 1.0 ml of acetone and 11.0 ml of sterile 0.1 aqueous polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate Tween 80 .

The buckets were filled with well water, and then innoculated with green algae from slants Scenedsmus . The algae bloom occurred in an untreated control in 24 hours. The compounds of formula IXA were formulated as a technical solution of 1 9 ratio by volume of acetone 0.1 by volume of Tween 80. The appropriate volume of water was added to the formulation to obtain the solutions containing 0.1 to 1.0 ppm of the active compound of formula IXA. The formulation was added to the bucket 24 hours after innoculation. The activity was determined by visual observation based upon nontreated controls. Plant injury ratings were made visually in a scale of 0 10 with 0 being no injury and 10 being plant death. The injury rating was multiplied by 10 to obtain a percent inhibition. The results of these tests are reported in Table III.

This means that the compound cannot be N 3 3 methylphenyl 5 isothiazolyl N,N dimethylurea More preferred compounds of formula X within this method are thole in which R and R1 are C1 C4 alkyl or C1 C2 alkoxy provided that one of R and RÚ is methyl R5 is hydrogen or 4 fluoro and n is 1. Even more preferred compounds of formula X are where R is C1 C3 alkyl R1 is methoxy or methyl provided that one of R and R1 is methyl and R5 is 4 fluoro. Most preferred compounds of formula X are N 3 4 fluorophenyl 5 isothiazolyl N ethyl N methyl N 1 methylethyl urea N 3 4 fluorophenyl 5 isothiazolyl N ,N,Ntrimethylurea N 3 4 fluorophenyl 5 isothiazolyll N ethyl N methylurea N 3 4 fluorophenyl 5 isothiazolyl Nmethoxy N methylurea and N 3 4 fluorophenyl 5 isothiazolyl N methoxy N methylurea monohydrochloride. The isothiazolylureas provided by formula X exhibit both terrestrial and aquatic herbicidal activity and accordingly are useful in the control and elimination of uiwanted vegetative growth. The herbicides of formula X are effective terrestrially in both preemergent and postemergent control of a wide variety of grasses and broadleaf weeds. Commonly encountered unwanted terrestrial vegetation which is subject to control with the herbicidal ureas of formula X include Wild Oats Avena fatua Catchweed Bedstraw Galium aparine Scentless Mayweed Matricaria inodora Ladysthumb Polygonum persicaria Common Chickweed Stellaria media Ivyleaf Speedwell Veronica hederaefolia Blackgrass Alopecurus myosuroides Chrysanthemum Chrysanthemum spp. Common Purslane Portulaca oleracea Sida Sida sPP, Bristly Starbur Acanthospermum hispidum Goosegrass Eleusine indica Smooth Pigweed Amaranthus hybridus Alexandergrass Brachiaria plantaginea Tall Morningglory Ipomoea purpurea Common Lambsquarters Chenopodium album Green Smartweed Pologonum scabrum Green Foxtail Setaria viridis Redroot Pigweed Amaranthus retroflexus Wild Buckwheat Polygonum convolvulus Brazil Calalilly Richardia brasiliensis Natal Grass Rhynchelytrum roseum Ryegrass Lolium rigidum Kapeweed Cryptostemma calendula Purple Loosestrife Lythrum salicaria Wild Radish Raphanus raphanistrum Wireweed Polygonum aviculare Henbit tamium amplexicaule wild Mustard Brassica kaber Barnyard Grass Echinochloa crus galli Foxtail Millet Setaria italica Velvetleaf Abutilon theophrasti Indian Mustard Brassica juncea Birdseye Speedwell Veronica persica Canada Thistle Cirsium arvense Wild Chamomile Matricaria chamomilla Annual Bluegrass Poa annua Buttercup Ranunculus spp. Field Speedwell Veronica agrestis Field Violet Viola arvensis Field Pennycress Thlaspi arvense wild Violet Viola tricolor Shirley Poppy Papaver rhoeas Field Poppy Papaver dubium Foolsparsley Aethusa cynapium Field Chickweed Cerastium arvense Southern Sandbur Cenchrus echinatus Large Crabgrass Digitaria sanguinalis Cheat Bromus secalinus Morningglory Ipomea spp. Common Ragweed Ambrosia artemisiifolia Common Milkweed Asclepias syriaca Giant Foxtail Setaria faberi Common Cocklebur Xanthium pensylvanicum Spurred Anoda Anoda cristata Sicklepod Cassia obtusifolia Yellow Nutsedge Cyperus esculentus Jimsonweed Datura stramonium Prickly Sida Sida spinosa Corn Gromwell Lithospermum arvense Yellow Foxtail Setaria RTI ID 91.5 glauca Tansymustard Descurainia pinnata Pepperweed Lepidium spp. Bromegrass Bromus spp. Garden Spurge Euphorbia hirta Crowfootgras 5 Dactyloctenium aegyptium Florida Beggarweed Desmodium tortuosum Spotted Spurge Euphorbia maculata Smallflower Morningglory Jacquemontia tamnifolia Browntop Millet Panicum ramosum Coast Fiddleneck Amsinckia intermedia Wild Turnip Brassica campestris Black Mustard Brassica nigra Shepherdspurse Capsella bursa pastoris Italian Ryegrass Lolium multiflorum London Rocket Sisombrium irio Redmaids Rockpurslane Calandrinia caulescens Common Groundsel Senecio vulgaris Ivyleaf Morningglory Ipomoea hederacea Fall Panicum Panicum dichotomiflorum Powell Amaranth Amaranthus powellii Texas Panicum Panicum texanum Hemp Sesbania Sesbania exaltata Annual Sowthistle Sonchus oleraceus Field Bindweed Convolvulus arvensis Erect Knotweed Polygonum erectum Venice Mallow Hibiscus trionum Zinnia Zinnia elegens Nightshade Solanum spp. The present compounds of formula X have. also been found safe on a wide variety of desirable plant species, thereby exhibiting their unique selective capacity.Representative examples of relatively tolerant plant species, depending on the concentration of active compounds of formula X employed, include the following Corn Zea mays Wheat Triticum aestivum Soybean Glycine max Rice Oryza sativa Barley Rordeum vulgare Cotton Ossypium hirsutum Sorghum Sorghum vulgare v. saccharatum Sugarcane Saccharum officinarum Peanut Arachis hypogaea Alfalfa Medicaqo sativa Cucumber Cucumis sativus Tomato Lycopersicon esculentum Sugar beets Beta vulgaris A test used to evaluate herbicidal efficacy was conducted at a compound concentration of 15 pounds per acre 16.8 kilograms per hectare .In this test a standard sand soil mixture 1 1 was sterilized and added to separate containers and tomato, large crabgrass, and pigweed seeds were planted by row. The test compounds of formula X were formulated for application by dissolving the compound into a solvent, containing acetone, ethanol, and a blend of anionic and nonionic surfactants. The solvent compound solution was diluted with deionized water and applied post emergence to some planted containers and preemergence to others. Postemergent treatment was made 11 to 13 days after planting, while preemergent treatment was made one day after planting. Following treatment the containers were moved to the greenhouse and watered as necessary. Observations were made 10 to 13 days after treatment using untreated control plants as standards. The degree of herbicidal activity was determined by rating the treated plants on a scale of 1 to 5. On this scale 1 indicates no injury, 2 is slight injury, 3 is moderate injury, 4 is severe injury, and 5 indicates death to the plant or no seedling emergence. Also, the various types of injury of each test species were coded as follows. A abscission of leaves B burned C chlorosis D death E epinasty F formation effects G dark green I increased plant growth L local necrosis N no germination P purple pigmentation R reduced germination S stunting U unclassified injury Table IV which follows presents the terrestrial herbicidal activity of the compound of formula X at 15 pounds per acre 16.8 kilograms per hectare .

Because of the potent terrestrial herbicidal activity possessed by the isothiazolylureas of formula X, they are useful in the elimination and control of the growth of unwanted terrestrial vegetation. This can be carried out by applying the herbicidal compounds by any of several art recognized methods. The compounds can be surface applied to soil prior to planting of crops or emergence of seedlings. If desired, the surface applied herbicide can be incorporated into the soil by conventional means The compounds can alternatively be applied early post emergence, for instance within about 2 weeks following seedling emergence. The amount of herbicidal isothiazolylureas of formula X to be employed is an amount which is effective in controlling the growth of unwanted vegetation. Such herbicidal amount will depend upon a number of factors, including the method of application, formulation, soil texture, soil moisture content, the expected population of unwanted vegetation, degree of incorporation, the extent of growth control desired, and related factors.The rate of application normally will be from about 0.01 to about 10.0 pounds per acre, and preferably from about 0.25 to about 5,0 O pounds per acre. These ranges are equivalent, respectively, to from about 0.011 to about 11.2 kilograms per hectare, and from about 0.28 to about 5.6 kilograms per hectare. Aquatic Herbicidal Method A method of controlling the growth of unwanted aquatic vegetation which comprises contacting the vegetation to be controlled or the water in which the vegetation is growing with an aquatic herbicidallyeffective amount of a compound of the formulaEMI109.1 wherein R3 is hydrogen, halo, C1 C2 alkoxy, or C1 Cs alkyl R6 and R7 are C1 C6 alkyl, or C1 C2 alkoxy, provided that one of R or is methyl and n is 1 or 2 or an aquatically acceptable acid addition salt thereof is also provided. More preferred compounds of formula XI within this method are those in which R3 is hydrogen, halo, or C1 C4 alkyl R6 and R7 are C1 C2 alkyl or C1 C2 alkoxy, provided that one of R6 or R7 is methyl and n is 1. Representative preferred compounds of formulaXI are N 3 4 methylphenyl 5 isothiazolyl Nmethoxy N methylurea N 3 4 chlorophenyl 5 isothiazolyl Nmethyl N 1 methylethyl urea N 3 4 fluorophenyl 5 isothiazolyl N,Ndimethylurea N 3 4 chlorophenyl 5 isothiazolyl N,Ndimethylurea N 3 phenyl 5 isothiazolyl N,N dimethyl urea N 3 4 chlorophenyl 5 isothiazolyl Nmethoxy N methylurea N 3 4 methylphenyl 5 isothiazolyl Nethyl N methylurea N 3 4 chlorophenyl 5 isothiazolyl Nmethyl N 1 methylpropyl urea N 3 4 chlorophenyl 5 isothiazolyl Nmethyl N 1 methylpropyl urea monohydrochloride N 3 4 fluorophenyl 5 isothiazolyl Nethyl N methylurea N 3 4 fluorophenyl 5 isothiazolyl Nmethoxy N methylurea monohydrochloride N 3 phenyl 5 isothiazolyl N methyl N 1 methylethyl urea and N 3 phenyl 5 isothiazolyl N methoxy Nmethylurea. The compounds of formula XI for the aquatic herbicide tests were formulated in the following manner.Twenty milligrams of compound was weighed into a 12 ml disposable vial. To the vial containing the compound were added 1 ml of acetone and 9 ml of aqueous 0.1 percent polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate Tween 80 .This solution was then diluted with appropriate volumes of water to obtain solutions containing 10, 4, 2, 1, and 0.5 ppm parts per million of the test compound. The herbicidal activity was determined by visual observations based upon non treated controls. Activity ratings were made on a scale of 1 to 5 as follows 1 no observable effect 2 slight plant injury 3 moderate plant in3ury 4 50 90 plant injury 5 plants completely killed The results of this test are reported inTables VIII and IX which follow.

The aquatic herbicidal method and the algicidal method are practiced by adding the active isothiazolylureas of formula XI or IXA to the water containing the submerged, emergent, ditchbank, or floating aquatic plants or algae or otherwise contacting aquatic plants with the active compounds, for example, by applying the compounds to the sub aqueous soil in which the aquatic plants are rooted. The formulations suitably contain from about 5 to about 90 percent by weight of the active ingredient. The compounds may also be mixed with surface active dispersing agents to form concen traces to facilitate dispersion in water and to improve the wetting properties when used as sprays. If desired, the compounds of formula XI orIXA may be mixed with a powdered solid carrier such as bentonite, Fullers earth, diatomaceous earth, or various mineral silicates, and clays, together with surface active wetting and dispersing agents, so that a wettable powder may be obtained which may be applied directly, or which may be mixed with water to make an aqueous dispersion for application in that form These wettable powder formulations suitably contain from about 25 to about 85 percent by weight of the active ingredient. The compounds may be dissolved in an oil, such as a hydrocarbon or chlorinated hydrocarbon oil, and the oil solution of the compound dispersed in water with the aid of a surface active emulsifying agent to give a sprayable aqueous emulsion. These surface active emulsifying agents may be anionic, nonionic, or cationic surface active agents.Such surface active agents are well known, and reference is made to Hoffman et al.,U.S. Patent No. 2,614,916, columns 2 4, for detailed examples of the same. Further, the compounds can also be applied in an invert emulsion formulation. An invert emulsion formulation is prepared by first making a solution of the compound in heavy oils, such as diesel fuel, inverting oil, and the like, and combining the thusobtained solution with water under high shear stirring.Densifying agents, such as powdered limestone or iron oxide, may be needed to increase the density of the invert. The thick emulsion is placed in the water and sinks to the bottom of the lake, river, pond, or the like, and the aquatic herbicide or algicide is gradually released to control the growth of the aquatic plants or algae. The following is an example of an invert emulsion formulation. Invert Emulsion Ingredient .AmountCompound of Example 37 12.5 gDiesel fuel 333 mlInverting oil 333 ml Visko Rhap Inverting Oil Rhodia, Inc. Two hundred fifty milliliters of this solution is combined with 3750 ml of water under high shear stirring to give a thick invert emulsion. The compounds useful as aquatic herbicides or algicides can also be applied as pellets, which are prepared from a mixture of about 5 of the active ingredient, about 87 balling clay, and about 10 water, all percentages being by weight. The mixture is then extruded through a pellet mill using a suitably sized die, e.g., about 1 8 in. 0.32 cm diameter. The extruded pellets are about 1 8 in. 0,32 cm by 1 1 2 in. 3.81 cm , and are then dried to about 8 moisture content. The method of controlling aquatic weeds or algae is practiced by adding to the water containing the submerged, emergent, ditchbank, or floating plants or algae, a herbicidal or algicidal amount of one of the compounds of formula XI or IXA, such that a concentration of from about 0.01 to about 10 ppm of the active compound is attained. The optimum concentration of active compound of formula XI or IXA for any specific aquatic control problem varies with the temperature, the species to be controlled, and the shape of the body of water to be treated. At higher water temperatures, less compound is generally required for a given degree of control than is needed at lower temperatures. When used to control algae or aquatic weeds, the compounds will usually be employed at concentrations of about 0.1 to about 10 ppm.In terms of pounds of compound per acre of water one foot deep, 0.1 to 10 ppm is equal to about 0.3 to about 30 pounds per acre of water one foot deep 33.6 kg ha of water 0.3 m deep . In considering the treatment of moving streams for the purpose of controlling vegetation fixed therein, special account must be taken of the fact that the compounds will pass over the area to be treated and that the concentration during the contact period is dependent upon the water flow rate, the rate of chemical addition, and the time period of addition. The isothiazolylurea herbicides of formula X to be employed according to the terrestrial method can be formulated for convenient application as aqueous sprays, solid pellets, or granules, and the like.Herbicidal formulations containing an isothiazolylurea of formula X will contain from about 1.0 to about 90 percent by weight of active isothiazolylurea, and can be prepared by combining the isothiazolylurea with any number of common herbicidal carriers, diluents, adju grants, and the like. The formulations can contain liquid carriers and adjuvants such as organic solvents, including benzene, xylene, toluene, a halotoluene such as ortho chlorotoluene, n hexane, n pentane, kerosene, and similar organic solvents. The formulations can additionally contain art known emulsifiers, stabilizers, dispersants, suspending agents, spreaders, penetrants, wetting agents, and the like. Typical carriers utilized in the dry formulations include clay, diatomaceous earth, silica, pyrophyllite, and the like. Herbicidal powders are prepared by grinding and blending such solid carriers with a compound of formula X. Granular formulations provided herein are prepared by impregnating an isothiazolylurea onto or into a granulated carrier such as a vermiculite.Such granules typically have a particle size of about 0.2 to about 2.0 mm. Preferred formulations are in the form of aqueous suspension concentrates flowables . Such formulations employ any number of commercially available wetting agents, and dispersing agents, such as ethoxylated nonyl phenols, ethoxylated octyl phenols, poly oxyethylene stearyl ethers, lignin sulfonates, blends of such agents, and the like. Such formulations can optionally contain adjuvants such as thickening agents, for instance heteropolysaccharide gums and the like such as xanthan gum as well as antibacterial agents, such as aqueous formaldehyde. The following detailed examples of formulations are given as illustrations.
