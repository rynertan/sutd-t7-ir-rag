## Description
A PLASTICIZED THERMOPLASTIC POLYMER BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention is directed to a plasticized thermoplastic polymer composition comprising in admixture, a thermoplastic polymer selected from a polyarylate derived from a dihydric phenol and at least one aromatic dicarboxylic acid, a polyetherimide, an aromatic polycarbonate, a poly aryl ether having a molecular weight in excess of 10,000, and mixtures thereof, and a poly aryl ether having a molecular weight of from about 1000 to about 5,000. Thermoplastic polymers such as polyarylates, polyetherimides, aromatic polycarbonates and poly aryl ether s are high temperature, high performance thermoplastic polymers with a good combination of thermal and mechanical properties. However, these thermoplastics are generally processed at high temperatures. For example, polyarylates are generally processed at temperatures of about 68O0C. At these temperatures the mechanical properties of the polymer may be detrimentally effected. Additives have been proposed which lower the processing temperature of the polymers. However, many of these polymers are not stable at these processing temperatures. Thus, there is a desire to lower the processing temperature of the polymer without effecting the mechanical properties. Also, if an additive is used to lower the processing temperature it must be compatible with and not degrade the polymer.Further, it is also desirous that the additive improve the soldability, i.e., the ability of the molten polymer to flow in a thin walled mold. In the present invention it has been found that low molecular weight poly aryl ether improves the moldability of a thermoplastic polymer in that the ability of the thermoplastic polymer melt to flow into thin walled molds is improved and also, the processing temperature of the thermoplastic polymer is reduced. THE INVENTION It has now been discovered that by admixing a poly aryl ether having a molecular weight of from about 1000 to about 5000 with a thermoplastic polymer selected from a polyarylate derived from a dihydric phenol and at least one aromatic dicarboxylic acid, a polyetherimide, an aromatic polycarbonate or a poly aryl ether having a molecular weight in excess of 10,000, or mixtures thereof, the thermoplastic polymer may be processed at a lower temperature, thus retaining the high mechanical properties of the polymer. Also, the thermoplastic polymer has improved moldability in that the ability of a thermoplastic polymer melt to flow into a thin walled mold is improved. In the practice of this invention, the poly aryl ethers which may be used are linear, thermoplastic polyarylene polyether polysulfones wherein the arylene units are interspersed with ether and sulfone linkages. These resins may be obtained by reaction of an alkali metal double salt of a dihydric phenol and a dihalobenzenoid compound, either or both of which contain a sulfone or ketone linkage, i.e., SO2 or CO between arylene groupings, to provide sulfone or ketone units in the polymer chain in addition to arylene units and ether units.The polysulfone polymer has a basic structure comprising recurring units of the formula o E 0 E wherein E is the residuum of the dihydric phenol andE is the residuum of the benzenoid compound having an inert electron withdrawing group in at least one of the positions ortho and para to the valence bonds both of said residua are valently bonded to the ether oxygens through aromatic carbon atoms.Such polysulfones are included within the class of polyarylene polyether resins described in U.S.patent 3,264,536, and 4,108,837 for example.

In general, the reactions can be advantageously carried out employing well known solvents, e.g., o dichlorobenzene, m cresol toluene, N,N dimethylacetamide, etc., in which to effect interaction between the dianhydrides and diamines, at temperatures of from about 20 to about 2500C.Alternatively, the polyetherimides can be prepared by melt polymerization of any dianhydride of Formula III with any diamino compound of Formula IV while heating the mixture of the ingredients at elevated temperatures with concurrent intermixing.Generally, melt polymerization temperatures between about 200 to 000C and preferably 230 to 3000C can be employed. Any order of addition of chain stoppers ordinarily employed in melt polymerization can be employed. The conditions of the reaction and the proportions of ingredients can be varied widely depending on the desired molecular weight, intrinsic viscosity, and solvent resistance.In general, equimolar amounts of diamine and dianhydride are employed for high molecular weight polyetherimides, however, in certain instances, a slight molar excess about 1 to 5 mol percent of diamine can be employed resulting in the production of polyetherimides of Formula I have an intrinsic viscosity n greater than 0.2 deciliters per gram, preferably 0.35 to 0.60, or 0.7 deciliters per gram or even higher when measured in m cresol at 250C.

The bis nitrophthalimide used in preparing the polymer is formed by reacting a diamine of the formula described above, NE2 R4 NH2, with a nitro substituted aromatic anhydride of the formula EMI13.1 The molar ratio of diamine to anhydride should ideally be about 1 2 respectively. The initial reaction product is a bis amide acid which is subsequently dehydrated to the corresponding bis nitrophthalimide . The diamines are described, supra. The preferred nitrophthalic anhydrides useful in the present invention are 3 nitrophthalic anhydride, 4 nitrophthalic anhydride and mixtures thereof. These reactants are commercially available in reagent grade. They may also be prepared by the nitration of phthalic anhydride using procedures described in Organic Syntheses, Collective Vol. I, holey 1948 , page 408. Certain other closely related nitroaromatic anhydrides may also be used in the reaction and are illustrated for example by 2 nitronaphthalic anhydride, 1 nitro 2,3 naphthalenedicarboxylic anhydride and 3 methoxy 6 nitrophthalic anhydride, and the like. With reference to the alkali metal salts of formula VI among the divalent carbocyclic aromatic radicals which R5 may represent mixtures of such radicals are also included are, for instance, divalent aromatic hydrocarbon radicals of from 6 to 20 carbon atoms, such as phenylene, biphenylene, naphthylene, etc. Included are residues of, e.g. hydroquinone, resorcinol, chlorohydroquinone, etc.In addition, Rmay be a residue of a dihydroxy diarylene compound in which the aryl nuclei are joined by either an aliphatic group, a sulfoxide group, sulfonyl group, sulfur, carbonyl group, oxygen, the OC CH3 CH2 2 CoOH group, etc. Typical of such diarylene compounds are the following 2, 4 dihydroxydiphenylmethane bis 2 hydroxyphenyl methane 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane bis 4 hydroxypbenyl methane bis 4 hydroxy S nitrophenyl methane bis 4 hydroxy 2,6 dimethyl 3 methoxyphenyl methane 1, 1 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl ethane 1,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl ethane l,l bis 4 hydroxy 2 chlorophenyl ethane l,1 bis 2,5 dimethyl 4 hydroxyphenyl ethane 1,3 bis 3 methyl 4 bydroxyphenyl propane 2, 2 bis 3 phenyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propane 2,2 bis 3 isopropyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propane 2,2 bis 4 hydroxynaphthyl propane hydroquinine naphthalene diols bis 4 hydroxyphenyl ether bis 4 hydroxyphenyl sulfide bis 4 hydroxyphenyl sulfone and the like. When dialkali metal salts of formula VI are used with the compound illustrated by formula V, the ingredients are advantageously present in an equal molar ratio for optimum molecular weight and properties of the polymer. Slight molar excesses, e.g., about 0.001 to 0.10 molar excess of either the dinitro substituted organic compound or of the alkali metal salt of formula may be employed.When the molar ratios are approximately equal, the polymer is substantially terminated by a Z N 2 at one end and a phenolic group at the other end.If there is a molar excess of one compound, that particular terminal group will predominate. The conditions of reaction whereby the alkali metal salt of formula IV is reacted with the dinitro substituted organic compound of formula III can be varied widely. Generally, temperatures of the order of about 25 1500C are advantageously employed, although it is possible to employ lower or higher temperature conditions depending on the ingredients used, the reaction product sought, time of reaction, solvent employed, etc. In addition to atmospheric pressure, superatmospheric pressures and subatmospheric pressures may be employed depending upon the other conditions of reaction, the ingredients used, the speed at which it is desired to effect reaction, etc. The time of reaction also can be varied widely depending on the ingredients used, the temperature, the desired yield, etc. It has been found that times varying from about 5 minutes to as much as 30 to 40 hours are advantageously employed to obtain the maximum yield and desired molecular weight. Thereafter the reaction product can be treated in the appropriate manner required to effect precipitation and or separation of the desired polymeric reaction product. Generally, common solvents such as alcohols e.g. methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, etc. and aliphatic hydrocarbons e.g. pentane, hexane, octane, cyclohexane, etc. may be employed as precipitants for this purpose. It is important that the reaction between the dinitro substituted organic compound of formulaIII and the alkali metal salt of formula IV mixtures of such alkali metal salts can also be used be carried out inthe presence of a dipolar aprotic solvent. The polymerization is performed under anhydrous conditions usually using dipolar aprotic solvents such as dimethylsulfoxide which are added in varying amounts depending upon the particular polymerization. A total quantity of solvent, dipolar aprotic solvent or mixture of such solvent with an aromatic solvent sufficient to give a final solution containing 10 20 by weight of polymer is preferably employed. The preferred polyetherimides include those of the formula EMI16.1 The thermoplastic aromatic polycarbonates that can be employed herein are homopolymers and copolymers and mixtures thereof which have an intrinsic viscosity of 0.40 to 1.0 dl g as measured in methylene chloride at 250C and are prepared by reacting a dihydric phenol with a carbonate precursor.Typical of some of the dihydric phenols that may be employed in the practice of this invention are bisphenol A i.e., 12,2 bis 4 hydroxy phenyl propane , bis 4 hydroyphenyl methane, 2,2 bis 4 hydroxy 3 methylphenyl propane, 4,4 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl heptane, 2,2 3,5,3 ,5 tetrachloro 4,4 dihydroxydiphenyl propane, 2,2 3,5,3 ,5 tetrabromo 4,4 dihydroxydi phenyl propane, 3,3 dichloro 4,4 dihydroxydiphenyl methane.

The polycarbonates can be prepared in a one phase homogeneous solution or two phase interfacial systems when phosgene or a haloformate are used. Bulk reactions are possible with the diarylcarbonate precursors. The poly aryl ether is used in plasticizing amounts of from about 0.5 to about 10 and preferably from about 2 to about 6 weight percent.

EXAMPLES The following examples serve to give specific illustrations of the practice of this invention but they are not intended in any way to limit the scope of this invention. In these examples, all parts and percentages are on a weight basis unless otherwise specified.

CONTROL A A polyarylate prepared from bisphenol A and a mixture of 50 mole percent of terephthalic acid chloride and 50 mole percent of isophthalic acid chloride by conventional methods having a reduced viscosity of 0.66 dl g as measured in p chlorophenol at 490C was injection molded in a 3 ounce Van Dorn molding machine at the following temperatures 6900FI 7200C and 7400F. Injection pressure was 18,000 p.s.i. and maximum injection speed was used. The mold temperature was 2800F. A spiral flow mold was used which had a flow channel thickness of 0.080 inches. The spiral flow mold is a long, spiral shaped channel of constant thickness, spruegated to inject melt at the center of the spiral. The channel is of such length that an injected melt will stop flowing before the channel is filled, due to melt cooling and increasing viscosity as it moves around the spiral. Length of flow therefore indicates ease by which a melt will flow into a mold. The polyarylate was molded into ASTM test bars at the three temperatures, i.e., 690 F, 7200F and 7400F. The data in Table I shows the inches of flow into the spiral mold versus melt temperature.Also the transparencey of the molded bars. The results are shown in Table I.
