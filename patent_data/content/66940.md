# Automatic C02 removal system and operation thereof.

## Abstract
A system is described for removing CO₂ from the manufactured process gas in an SNG manufacturing plant, the system operating the hot carbonate process wherein hot potassium carbonate solution absorbs CO₂ from the process gas under pressure in an absorber column 1 and is regenerated by pressure reduction and steam stripping in a regenerator column 14 and a re boiler 17 before being returned to the absorber by a circulating pump 7. The system is completely automated and is controlled by a computer so that start up, running and shut down of the system is carried out automatically upon initiation by an operator, whereby the system is particularly suited for use in peak load SNG plants. For this purpose the system includes a solu tion make up tank 30, a solution storage tank 31, and a flushing water collection tank 32, preferably has all of its surfaces contacted by potassium carbonate solu tion made of stainless steel, and has sensors F, L, T, P, AN, SC and PH and valve switches for transmitting information to the computer relating to the state of the system. The computer is programmed to operate the se quences of operation necessary to achieve the start up, running and shut down of the system, operate loop con trols on the solution levels in the absorber and regen erator columns, and on the rates of flow of solution to the absorber and of steam to the reboiler, and also to monitor the system parameters and to display data and signal alarm conditions.
