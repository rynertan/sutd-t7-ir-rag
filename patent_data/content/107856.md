# Lamp control circuit.

## Abstract
A lamp control control circuit has triacs 16, 18 for controlling a current from an AC power supply 14 and supplying a controlled current to lamps 10, 12 a phase angle control unit 46 for generating phase angle control pulses for a soft start switching controllers 20, 22 for triggering the triacs 16, 18 in response to phase angle control pulses, respectively and switches 32, 34 for selecting the lamp 10, 12 which is to be energized. The control circuit has additional switches 42, 44 for detecting the lamp selecting operation of the switches 32, 34 . The phase angle control unit 46 is started in response to a signal from those switches 42, 44 .
