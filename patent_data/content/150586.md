## Description
The present invention relates to novel substituted 2 pyridylmethylthio benzimidazoles and 2 pyridylmethylsulfinyl benzimidazoles which can have utility as gastric anti secretory and cytoprotective agents. Gastrointestinal inflammatory diseases are characterised, specifically, by oedema, inflammatory cells i.e. leukocytes, histiocytes and macrophages and, in some cases, necrosis and ulceration of the surface epithelium. Agents in the gastrointestinal tract, such as micro organisms viruses and fungi , bacterial toxins, antibiotics, anti inflammatory steroids, bile salts, toxic household chemicals and gastric acid itself, can attack the stomach lining and produce inflammation. One means of prevention or treatment is by the inhibition of gastric acid secretion, particularly where the integrity of the gastric mucosal barrier is compromised and gastric acid secretion results in erosion of the epithelial cells. US A 3903297 describes effective anti secretory prostaglandins. Another important class of anti secretory agents is the histamine H₂ receptor antagonists, including metiamide and, most importantly, cimetidine. Another means is cytoprotection. US A 4083998, US A 4081553 and US A 4097603 describe the cytoprotective effects of prostaglandins. US A 4097603 and Robert, Gastroenterology US A 4045563 discloses 2 pyridylalkylsulfinyl benzimidazoles, and US A 4255431 and US A 4337257 disclose 2 2 benzimidazolyl pyridines, which may inhibit gastric secretion. US A 4359465 discloses the cytoprotective use of certain heterocyclylalkylsulfinylbenzimidazoles. GB A 2134523 discloses some compounds of formula I, for use in the treatment of gastric disorders. Novel compounds according to the present invention are of formula I wherein X is S or SO R₂ is C₁ ₃ alkylthio R₃ is H or C₁ ₄ alkyl and R₄ is H or C₁ ₄ alkyl. C₁ ₄ alkyl means methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl or an isomeric form thereof. The compounds of the present invention will be named herein using the Chemical Abstracts numbering system see Naming and Indexing of Chemical Substances for Chemical Abstracts during the Ninth Collective Period 1972 1976 , a reprint of section IV from the Volume 76 Index Guide . Compounds of this invention have been tested in one or more standard laboratory tests which demonstrate gastric antisecretory activity. In a text for A significant advantage of certain of the compounds of the present invention, particularly those of formula I wherein R₁ is hydrogen, X is SO , R₃ is methyl or ethyl, R₄ is hydrogen, and R₂ is methylthio, ethylthio or propylthio, more preferably ethylthio, is their long duration of activity when administered subcutaneously. Thus, even after 6 days, 2 4 ethylthio 3 ethyl 2 pyridinyl methyl sulfinyl benzimidazole and 2 4 ethylthio 3 methyl 2 pyridinyl methyl sulfinyl benzimidazole inhibited gastric acid secretion in the rat by 68 and 82 , respectively, when administered subcutaneously at a dose of 50 mg kg. As noted, all of the compounds of this invention are useful as gastric antisecretory agents. Compounds of this invention are administered for gastric antisecretory pruposes orally, parenterally e.g. intravenously, subcutaneously, intramuscularly or intraparenterally , intradermally, rectally or vaginally in forms such as pills, capsules, solutions, suspensions, suppositories or bougies. The compounds of this invention are formulated into these pharmaceutical compositions by means known to the pharmaceutical art. An ordinarily skilled physician can readily determine persons suffering from gastrointestinal diseases characterised by the gastric acid induced effects noted above. These conditions are treated using the compounds of the present invention. Typical doses for the compounds of this invention range from 0.01 µg per kg to 250 mg per kg, preferably from about 0.1 to 100 µm per kg. The choice of the use, route and frequency of administration of the compounds of this invention depends on the weight, age and gastrointestinal disease of the patient and the particular compound employed. These decisions are readily made by a physician of ordinary skill in the art. However, to achieve a longer duration of action, these compounds are administered subcutaneously. This is the preferred route for administering the class of compounds noted above having this property, when the therapeutic objective requires it. However, when a long duration of action is not desired, and or the compounds lack this property, any convenient route of administration e.g. oral is employed. The long duration of activity of certain of the compounds of this invention, as noted above, allows them to be used prophylactically in the treatment of patients with a high possibility of developing stress ulcerations. Further, this latter class of compounds can be administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly on a weekly, biweekly or monthly basis for the prophylaxis and or treatment of gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, gastritis, esophagitis, Zollinger Ellison syndrome, stress ulcers and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The frequency of administration will depend on the particular compound employed as well as the dose. The compounds of this invention may also exert cytoprotective effects. If employed for this purpose, they could be administered as described, for example, in US A 4359465, particularly cols. 7 and 8 thereof. The doses employed for this purpose would in general be less than those used for gastric antisecretory effects. The compounds of the present invention are prepared by the methods depicted in Chart A. Certain starting materials are prepared by the methods depicted in Chart B. In the Charts, M is an alkali metal, and all other variables are as defined above. In Chart A, scheme 1, a substituted α picolyl chloride of the Formula A 2 is reacted with 2 mercaptobenzimidazole of the Formula A 1 in the presence of a strong base e.g. 10 N sodium hydroxide . Substituted α picolyl chloride compounds are well known, readily available compounds or may be prepared by known means, such as depicted in Chart B, as described below.

The formula A 5 compounds are known and are prepared as described in U.S. Patents 4,045,563 4,255,431 and 4,337,257. The chlorinated compounds of the formula A 6 are prepared by reacting the N oxide intermediates of Charts B I with known chlorinating agents e.g., POCl₃, PCl₃, and PCl₅ . In scheme 3 of Chart A, a chlorinated benzimidazole of the formula A 7 is reacted with the formula A 8 thiol to yield the formula A 3 product which is converted to the formula A 4 product as described above. The formula A 7 and A 8 compounds are known or may be prepared by the methods described in U.S. Patents 4,045,563 4,255,431 and 4,337,257, using the intermediates prepared as described herein. In scheme 4 of Chart A, the diamino compound of the formula A 9 is reacted with the formula 4 10 acid to yield the formula A 3 product which is converted to the formula A 4 product as described above. The formula A 9 and A 10 compounds are known or may be prepared as described in U.S. Patents 4,045,563 4,255,431 and 4,337,257 using the intermediates prepared as described herein. The reaction of A 1 with A 2 Chart A, scheme 1 is carried out in a manner which is known in the art in suitable, preferably polar solvents such as methanol, dimethylsulfoxide, acetone, dimethylformamide or acetone with the addition or exclusion of water. It is carried out for example in the presence of a proton acceptor. Examples of suitable proton acceptors are alkali metal hydroxides, such as sodium hydroxide, alkali metal carbonates, such as potassium carbonate, and tertiary amines, such as pyridine, triethylamine or ethyl diisopropylamine. The reaction temperature can be between 0 and 150 C, temperatures between 50 and 100 C, and especially the boiling point of the solvent used, being preferred. Similar reaction conditions to those for the reaction of A 1 with A 2 are used in the reaction of A 7 with A 8 Chart A, scheme 3 which is carried out in a manner which is known in the art. The reaction of A 9 with A 10 Chart A, scheme 4 is preferably carried out in polar, optionally water containing solvents in the presence of a strong acid, for example hydrochloric acid, in particular at the boiling point of the solvent used. The oxidation of sulfides A 3 is carried out in a manner which is known per se and under conditions with which those skilled in the art are familiar for the oxidation of sulfides to give sulfoxides. Possible oxidizing agents are all the reagents usually employed for oxidation of sulfides, in particular peroxyacids, such as for example, peroxyacetic acid, trifluoroperoxyacetic acid, 3,5 dinitroperoxybenzoic acid, peroxymaleic acid or, preferably m chloroperoxybenzoic acid. The reaction is expediently carried out in inert solvents, for example aromatic or chlorinated hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene, methylene chloride or chloroform. The reaction temperature is between 70 C and the boiling point of the solvent used, but preferably between 30 C and 20 C depending on the reactivity of the oxidizing agent and the degree of dilution . The oxidation with halogens or hypohalogenites e.g., with aqueous sodium hypochloride solution , which is carried out expediently at temperatures between 0 and 30 C has also proved to be very advantageous. The reaction of A 5 with A 6 Chart A, scheme 2 is preferably carried out in inert solvents, such as those which are also usually employed for the reaction of enulate ions with alkylating agents. Examples which may be mentioned are aromatic solvents, such as benzene or toluene. The reaction temperature is as a rule between 0 and 120 C depending on the nature of the alkali metal atom M preferably at the boiling point of the solvent. For example, if M represents Li lithium and the reaction is carried out in benzene, the boiling point of benzene 80 C is preferred. Chart B depicts a method for preparing substituted α picolyl chlorides of the Formula A 2. A substituted 2 methyl pyridine compound of the Formula B 1 such compounds are well known and readily available, or may be prepared by known means, see, e.g., R.A. Abramovitch and G.A.

This compound is treated with concentrated sulfuric acid and fuming nitric acid, to yield the corresponding nitro compound of the Formula B 3. The nitro compound is treated with acetyl chloride, to yield the corresponding Formula B 4 chloride. The Formula B 4 compound is heated with a compound of the formula R₂H in the presence of sodium hydride and dimethylformamide, to yield the Formula B 5 compound which is then treated with acetic anhydride to yield the Formula B 6 compound. The acyl group is removed by mild acidic hydrolysis e.g. treatment with 10 hydrochloric acid or saponification with base e.g. treatment with 25 sodium methoxide in methanol , to yield the Formula B 7 alcohol. This alcohol is then treated with methanesulfonyl chloride and triethylamine to yield the corresponding substituted α picolyl chloride of Formula B 8 A 2 .
