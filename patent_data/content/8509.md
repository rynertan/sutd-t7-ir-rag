# Control circuits for solenoids.

## Abstract
A solenoid control circuit includes a first switching ele ment 11 which connects one side of the solenoid load 10 to earth via a current sensing resistor. The other side of the solenoid load is connected by a second switching element 14 to a supply rail 15 . This second switching element is biased to conduct but can be turned off by either of two comparators 43, 44 which are connected to compare the voltage across the current sensing resistor with two different reference vol tages. Each comparator has hysteresis and the circuit oper ates to that one comparator 43 operates to switch off the second switching element when a predetermined current level is reached and the other comparator 44 operates to switch the second switching elements on and off at lower current levels between said predetermined current level and the lower threshold level of the first comparator.
