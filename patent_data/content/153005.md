# Polyethylene wax.

## Abstract
Synthetic polyethylene wax having low molecular weight of 250 to 3000 and a density of 0.930 to 0.950 is prepared in a high pressure process at pressures of at least 800 bar using a carbonyl compound such as acetaldehyde as chain transfer agent. The resulting wax with incorporated CO has good compatibility in hot melt systems, and may be stripped to remove light ends, increase density and crystallinity and improve thermal stability.
