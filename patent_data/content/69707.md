# Method of oxidising semiconductor substrates.

## Abstract
The invention concerns a procedure for oxidising subs trates of Gallium Arsenide. In particular, according to the present invention, the oxidation of Gallium Arsenide subs trates tends to compact oxide layers which are compatible with the technology for producing active semiconductor devices. The oxide is formed by means of a reactive gas discharge onto a substrate whose temperature has been raised sufficiently to render the material sufficiently conduct ing so as to avoid localized charge build up on the surface which then impedes oxide growth in the reactive plasma discharge.

## Claims
CLAIMS 1 A procedure for oxidising substrates on semi insulating semiconductor material, characterised by the fact that the semi insulating substrate temperature is increased so as to reduce the material resistivity and thus allowing the charge flow necessary for anodic oxidation. 2 Procedure as in claim 1 characterised by the fact that said semi insulating semiconductor material constitutes gallium arsenide. 3 Procedure for oxidising substrates of semi insulating semiconductor materials by means of a reactive gas plasma discharge in which the temperature increase of the substrate according to the claim is attained by means of the same r.f. power which produces the plasma discharge. 4 Procedure as in claim 3 characterised by the fact that said semiconductor material constitutes gallium arsenide.

## Description
PROCEDURE FOR THE OXIDATION OF GALLIUM SUBSTRATES DESCRIPTIONThe present invention regards a procedure for the oxidation of gallium arsenide substrates.The formation of stable oxide layers with good characteristics on substrates of semi insulating gallium arsenide presents great interest both from the point of view of fabricating MOS type devices as well as a substrate encapsulant during thermal annealing after ion implantation.Other oxidation procedures such as the electrolytic process with an electrolyte or the reactive plasma gas discharges yield good results on materials with relatively good electrical conductivity, however they do not lend themselves to the oxidation of semi insulating material because the latter does not allow the passage of electric current, across the substrate surface, necessary for oxidation.For semi insulating materials such as gallium arsenide, the approachost commonly used is that of a non native oxide deposition with all the associated inconveniences.According to the present invention, by utilising the fact that the resistivity of semiconductors decreases with increasing temperature, it is proposed to heat the sample or substrate, during the reactive gas plasma oxidation, at a temperature sufficiently which reduces the sample or substrate resistivity to a sufficiently low value to allow the necessary movement of charge which is exchanged during the reactive plasma oxidation phenomenon.The temperature increase necessary to achieve the desired effect described, is much less thtan that necessary to achieve an appreciable thermal oxidation and as such does not create any decomposition problems with compound semiconductors as for example gallium arsenide.In practic temperature between 400 and 5000C has been found to be adequate for gallium arsenide.In practice the sample or substrate of gallium arsenide semi insulating material is introduced into an r.f. plasma reactor by placing it, by means of a good thermal contact, onto a graphite support which is in turn induction healed preferably by the same r.f. generator which produces the plasma discharge.With the technique described in the present invention it is possible to obtain the oxidation of a semi insulating material with a native oxide. This type of oxide is preferred to the non native oxides because in the latter case stresses are generally introduced at the interface and the adhesion is often poor. According to this invention the procedure can be used whenever a good quality oxide has to be ground on semi insulating gallium arsenide, and in particular, as some specific examples a The oxide can be grown on the semi insulating material before ion implantion which is carried out across the oxide and left on the sample as an encapsulant during thermal annealing for activating the implanted donors .b The oxide can be used as an insulator in a MOS metal oxide semiconductor type structure. The present invention has been described with reference to a currently preferred solution, however it is clear that variations and modifications can be made without escaping from the protection rights of the present industrial privacy.
