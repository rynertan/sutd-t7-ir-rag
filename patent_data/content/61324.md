# Computer memory management.

## Abstract
A computer system has separate memory management units 17, 19 for use with a central processing unit 11 to separately control expanding stack and data memory portions within a single logical memory segment associated with a memory 13. The stack and data portions are prevented from expanding into each other by a break register 27 or 29 which contains an address between the two memory portions and is updated as the stack and data memory portions expand and contract. The stack memory management unit 17 only is enabled when a portion of the memory is addressed on one side of the break value while the data memory management unit 19 is only utilised when the address is on the other side of the break value. The computer system enables better utilisation of the available memory space.
