# Method and apparatus for etching copper.

## Abstract
A method for etching copper metal from articles, such as printed circuit boards, by contacting the articles with an etchant solution containing cupric tetrammine ions at an etching station 1, transferring the etchant solution to a catholyte compartment 42 only of an electrochemical cell 20 in which dissolved copper is removed from the solution as copper metal by electrochemical reduction, and returning the etchant solution to the etching station 1. The invention also provides apparatus specifically adapted for carrying out the method, in which apparatus the electrochemical cell 20 is adapted for the removal of copper from the etchant solution by electrochemical reduction, the cell 20 including an ion exchange membrane 44,46 to divide the cell into anode and cathode compartments 40, 42 .
