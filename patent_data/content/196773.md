# Easy entry seat adjuster.

## Abstract
An easy entry seat adjuster includes a latch member 38 which is resiliently biased to a latched position and can be manually moved to an unlatched position to adjust the seat. When the seat moves to the easy entry position, tilting movement of the seat back moves a blocking member 80 into engagement with the latch member to move the latch member to the unlatched position and block return thereof to the unlatched position. Movement of the seat from the easy entry position rearwardly engages the latch member with an abutment of the lower track member 14 to release the latch member from the blocking member and permit the blocking member to return to unblocking position and the latch member to the latched position.
