# METHOD OF DETERMINING AN OPERATING PATH OF A TOOL

## Abstract
Information concerning the path of an adhesive applying nozzle 28 and or a lasting roller 176 relative to a three di mensional shoe bottom surface is obtained using a flat insole in combination with a grid of flexible transparent material. The grid has a datum 10 , a centre line 12 representing a linear path of a tool carrier 26 and a plurality of transverse lines 14 , the spacing between each pair of adjacent transverse lines representing unit time. The transverse lines adjacent to the datum are more closely spaced than those beyond, the prin cipal component of movement of the tool as opposed to the tool carrier in relation to the shoe bottom, at the datum i.e. the toe end , being widthwise rather than iengthwise. Heel height information may also be supplied to the computer, which is programmed to modify the digitised information ac cordingly for the region from the ball region to the heel which constitutes some 60 to 65 of the overall shoe length . The information may also be modified according to the particular arrangement of the nozzle and roller supports.
