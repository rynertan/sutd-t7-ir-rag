# System for storing and dispensing magnetic tape cartridges.

## Abstract
A system for storing and dispensing a magnetic tape cartridges having a plurality of rows 10 of pivotal storage cells 14 within a frame 2 each cell has a cartridge discharge end and a rear wall 22 at the opposite end. A support 12 is located beneath the cell and pivot means 16 are located intermediate the ends of the cell to permit the cell to pivot on the support means relative to the horizontal. Means are provided to limit the amount of pivotal movement of the cell relative to the horizontal. The center of gravity of the cell is located closer to the cartridge discharge end than to the rear wall end. The cartridge discharge end of the cell normally is inclined to pivot downwardly relative to the horizontal. Means 78 are provided to limit the amount of pivotal movement of the cartridge discharge end of the cell at substantially a horizontal position. Means 15 are also provided to offer resistance to the downward pivotal move ment of the rear wall end of the cell.
