# Lifting platform for panels and method of operation thereof.

## Abstract
A lifting platform designed to feed stacks of panels to a machining line, in synchronism with the operation of a composite pusher 12 which is controlled to skim the top side of the stack of panels on said platform, is provided with means 5 5 for locally lifting said stack, said means being normally in a rest position to avoid interfering with the bottom side of said stack. The pushing fingers of the pusher are disposed in the same vertical ideal planes containing said means 5 5 for locally lifting the stack. Arranged above said stack are dimension feelers 14 , one for each said lifting means and vertically in line therewith. At the beginning of each feeding cycle, the lifting platform is in its lowest position, the dimension feelers 14 are lowered completely and said platform is then lifted by a pre stablished amount X which is detected and evaluated by the feeler, or feelers, that have first engaged the top of the stack of panels, and thereupon said feelers, or feelers, will cause the platform to stop. Thereafter, the feelers that had not reached said pre established dimension will be also raised and brought into a co planar relation with the others, by selectively actuating the underlying lifting means 5 5 which will lift the interposed portion of stack by an appropriate amount. The pusher 12 will engage, after said dimension feelers have been raised, portions of a stack having the same thickness X .
