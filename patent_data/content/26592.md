# Internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
An internal combustion engine is provided having a pair of cylinders 20,22 interconnected by means of a narrow connecting channel 24 . A working piston 30 reciprocates in one cylinder 20 and is conventionally attached to a crankshaft 16 by means of a connecting rod 32 and crankpin. An auxiliary piston 40 reciprocates in the other cylinder 22 and is driven in timed relation to the working piston by means of a cam 50 affixed to the crankshaft and a cam follower 54 attached to a connecting rod 56 . Means are provided for adjusting the relative timing of the two pistons so as to vary the compression ratio of the engine. The auxiliary piston may function as a compression and ignition means by moving rapidly toward its top dead center position only when the working piston is close to its top dead center position. Other movements of the auxiliary piston provide the advantages of low pressure internal supercharging, and minimizing the retarding effect on the working piston by the compressive forces within the combustion chamber.
