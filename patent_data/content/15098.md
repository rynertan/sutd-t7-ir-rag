# Process for removing alkalinity and hardness from water.

## Abstract
Raw water is fed to a first column containing a weak acid cation exchange resin in hydrogen form whore alkalinity caus ing ions and hardness causing ions to the extent of alkalinity are converted to carbonic acid. The carbonic acid, which hyd rolyzes to dissolved carbon dioxide, is stripped from the water in a decarbonation unit by passing air countercurrent to the flow of water through the unit. The water is then fed to a second column containing a weak acid cation exchange resin in sodium form which removes residual hardness causing ions along with neutralization of any mineral acids or residual dissolved carbon dioxide. Both resins are substantially com pletely regenerated upon exhaustion to provide a process in which the maximum capacities of the resins are utilized, and the process can be carried out with a minimum of monitoring and control.
