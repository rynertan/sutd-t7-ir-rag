## Abstract
To provide for effective force transfer upon striking of blows between plastic end portions covering a metal, typi cally steel, core without damage to the plastic striking end portions 201, 202 , the plastic end portions 201, 202 form part of a single unitary plastic element 200 cover ing the metal core 100 which, generally, is of ellipsoid shape. The metal core has flat end portions 102, 103 , with positioning protrusions 104, 105 extending into matching recesses formed in the striking portions 201, 202 of the plastic covering. The various surfaces of the metal core are joined by inclined surfaces which may be flat or curved and form part of the generally ellipsoid sur faces whereby, upon striking of blows, fissures and breakage of the striking portions are avoided.
