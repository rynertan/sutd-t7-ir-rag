# X ray photographic apparatus.

## Abstract
An x ray photographic apparatus comprises an x ray generator 13 for transmitting x ray radiation through an object or patient under examination. The x ray image obtained thereby is photographed by a television camera 14,15 . The output from the camera is then converted into digital form by an analog to digital converter 16 . The resulting digital data are successively stored in a memory 17 having a storage capacity just large enough to store data relating to one image frame. The data stored in the memory are read out by first readout means 10,18 and are then converted into analog form by a first digital to analog converter 27 . A television monitor 28 , which operates in synchronism with the reading out of data from the memory, is supplied with the output from the first D A converter so that the monitor displays the image. A register 30 stores an amount of the output read from the memory which corre sponds to one image line. Data are repeatedly read from this register by second readout means 9,21 1 to 21 n,24 and are converted into analog form by a second digital to analog converter 32 . Data relating to one image line are then fed to a cathode ray tube 35 , which applies a scanning light signal to photosensitive paper 37 to print the image line thereon. As each line of the image is printed on the paper, the paper is shifted in stepwise fashion by a stepping motor 42 so that a complete printed image is formed, corresponding to a selected one of the images produced by the transmission of x ray radiation through the object or patient.
