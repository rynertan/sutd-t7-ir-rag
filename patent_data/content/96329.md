# SAIL SUPPORT AND CONTROL SYSTEM

## Abstract
This invention provides an improved system for causing swinging of a boom of a sail support system as described in the above identified application, in which the boom support, which is rotatable about the mast or mast support is driven in rotation by hydraulic or pneumatic cylinders suitably arranged to rotate the boom about 90 to either side of the fore and aft position. In one embodiment of the invention two cylinders are symmetrically positioned in relation to the boom support so as to enable rotation of the boom 90 to port or starboard without interference of the cylinder rods with the boom support, and so that the rotating force can be applied to the boom support is never less than the force that is available from one cylinder acting at the maximum radius. Means is also provided to prevent the boom from swinging at an excessive rate, such as when it is being swung out to catch the wind, by controlling the flow of fluid out of the cylinders. Means is also provided for holding the boom in a desired position. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the boom support and the cylinders are mounted on a support frame on an upper deck of the ship, with means being provided for measuring the force applied by the frame to the ship. Since the cylinders act between the support frame and the boom support, the forces applied by the cylinders are isolated from the propulsion force measuring device.
