# Improved apparatus and method for installing electrical connectors on flat conductor cable.

## Abstract
Apparatus and method for installing electrical connec tors onto flat conductor cables wherein the connectors are fed to the machine from a magazine, transferred from the magazine to a press, caotured by the press and then pressed onto and through the cable over an anvil which holds the connector to form a secure connection with the cable. The resulting profile of the connector is such that it extends through the conductor of the cable and is held thereon by a flange on one side of the cable, an eyelet type crimp on the opposite side of the cable and a lance means. The transfer means includes a connector holder which carries the connec tor from the magazine to a guide pin on the press. The guide pin captures the connector and retains it as the holder is returned to the magazine. The holder has two regions thereon and automatically switches their orientations as it approaches the press area. The first region includes a ramp to carry the guide pin across the holder to the connector as the holder approaches the press. The second region includes a clearance means to enable the holder to clear the connector as the holder is returned to the magazine after the guide pin captures the connector.
