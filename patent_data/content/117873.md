# DYNAMIC PRESSURE TYPE OF FLUID BEARING DEVICE.

## Abstract
A dynamic pressure type of fluid bearing device has a housing 11 provided with a bearing hole 11a , a shaft 13 rotatably mounted in the hole 11a , and a thrust bearing member 12 mounted on the end face of the housing 11 , grooves 13b in the surface of either the shaft 13 or the hole 11a , grooves 12a provided in the surface of the member 12 in contact with the shaft 13 , a ventilation groove 12e communicating with the atmosphere and formed on the surface of the member 12 in contact with the housing 11 and lubricating oil 14 provided around the periphery of the grooves 13b . This prevents the lubricating oil flowing out because of variations in the atmospheric pressure.
