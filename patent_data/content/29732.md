## Description
CLRAKIC BALL VALVE The present invention relates to a ceramic ball valve, and more particularly to a ceramic ball valve in which the components to be brought into contact with the fluid to be controlled, such as a valve box, z ball housed in the valve box, and a valve seat in contact with the ball, are made of ceramics, the ball being formed with 2 fluid channel and being rotatable for controlling the flow of the fluid.. A majority of conventional ball valves are mace of stainless steel, brass or like metal. Metal valves are tough and therefore generally have a sufficient long life but are prone to corrosion when used for controlling thXe flows of acid or alkali liquids and gases. Accordingly valves for controlling such corrosive fluids must be made from corrosion resistant materials such as ceramics. Although resistant to compressive forces, ceramics have low strength against tension, shear and impact. Burthermore, it is almost impossible to join ceramic members together by crewing, adhesion or vtelding. Vixen making corrosion resistant valves from ceramic members in combination, it is therefore impossible to join the components together by the abovementioned method. Additionally the components must be so arranged as to be free from tensile forces. The ball in ball valves is held between the valve seats at the inlet and outlet sides of the valve in intimate contact therewith. The more intimately the ball is in contact with the valve seats, the smaller is the leakage of the fluid. When the valve is in its closed position, the high pressure fluid on the inlet side presses the seat and ball against each other tightly. If the valve is held closed for 2 prolonged period of time, the seat and ball engage each other rigidly and will not be released from each other readily, necessitating great torque to open the valve. Accordingly the ball valve requires much labor when manually operable. .hen adapted to be operated mechanically by an acbuator, such as a motor or a hydraulic or pneumatic cylinder, the valve needs an actuator of great output, hence uneconomical. The ball of the ball valve is rotatable by 2 valve rod connected to the ball. The rod is inserted at its one end in a bore formed in the ball. If the ball and the valve seat involve great friction therebetween, the bored portion is subjected to a great force, which is 2 kind of shearing force Consequently, when the ball valve is opened and closed repeatedly a number of tes, the bored portion of the ball is liable to break.The frictional force betveen the ball and the seat is dependent on the pressure acting between the ball and the seat and the coefficient of friction concerned comprises a valve box having an inner space in its center and opened at its opposite ends, a ball disposed in the inner space of the valve box and having a fluid channel extending through the center thereof, an inlet socket and an outlet socket arranged in contact with the opposite ends of the valve box to hold the valve box therebetv.een and respectively having zn inlet opening and an outlet opening in communication with the inner space, a valve seat supporting the ball rotatably, and fastening members rigidly joining the.valve box and the sockets together by a compressive force. The valve box, the ball, the sockets and the valve seat are made of ceramics. Since the main components of the ball valve to be brought into contact v.ith a fluid are made of ceramics, the valve is resistant to corrosion even if the fluid is an acid or alkali. The main components of ceramics are tightly joined toeter b being subjected to a compressive force by the fastening members, so kat no shearing force or tensile force will act on these components for joining them together. To reduce the force of friction to be produced between the ball and the valve seat, the valve seat is formed on each of the sockets, or the ball is formed with a passage for permitting the inlet opening of the inlet socket to communicate with the inner space of the valve box v.ten the ball is in its valve closing position. The reduction of the friction between the ball and the valve seat thus assured according to the invention no longer necessitates great torque when rotating the ball to open the valve, permitting the use of an actuator of small output and eliminating the possible damage to the ball. Other features of this invention will become apparent from the following description. Figs 1 to 3 show zn embodiment Fig L is a view in section taken along the ine I I in Fig 22 Fig 2 is a right side view of the embodiment Fig. 3 is a view in section taken along the line III III in Fig. 2 Signs. 4 and 5 are sectional views of a ball and z valve seat for illustrating a force acting therebetween the ball shown in Fig. 4 having no communication cutout, the ball shot in Fig. 5 being formed with a com lunic tion cutout Fig. 6 is a sectional view showing z ball having a different communication passage Fig. 7 is a sectional view corresponding to 4 ig. 1 and showing another embodiment and Fir. 8 is a sectional view corresponding to pig. 1 and showing another embodiment. With reference to Figs. 1 to 3, the ceramic ball valve shown consists essentially of a valve box 2 in the form of 2 cylinder and having an inner space 12 in its center, an inlet socket 3 and an outlet socket 4 arranged at the opposite sides of the valve box 2, and a ball 5 housed in the inner space 12 of the valve box 2. The sockets 3 and 4 each have a circular outer periphery and are centrally formed with zn inlet opening 13 and an outlet opening 14, respec timely, having z diameter d. Stepped portions 10 and 11 are formed in the opposite ends of the valve box 2 and also in one end of each of the sockets 3, 4.The stepped portions 10, 11 of the onposd members are joined together, Vith an 0 ring 15 provided in each of the junctions, whereby the junction is sealed gas or liquid tightly. Beach of the other ends of the sockets 3, 4 is zlso formed with a stepped portion 17. One end of the inlet socket 3 around the inlet opening 13 has a recess 16 having accommodated therein an annular valve seat member 6. An O ring 18 is disposed between the recessed portion 16 and the seat member 6. The seat member 6 has a valve seat 26 in smooth contact with the spherical surface of the ball 5 One end of the outlet socket 4 around the outlet 14 has a valve seat 24 in smooth contact with the spherical surface of the ball 5. There is not seat member on the outlet side the valve seat is formed directly on the socket 4. The ball 5 is rotatably supported on these valve seats 26 and 24. The ball 5 has a fluid channel 7 extending through its center and opened at its opposite ends on the spherical surface of the ball 5. The fluid channel 7 of the present embodiment is substantially triangular in cross section. When having such a triangular cross section, the fluid channel possess approximately linear flow characteristics0 In cross section, the squid channel may of course be circular, square, rectangular or of any desired shape.When having a circular cross section measuring d in diameter, the iluid channel involves a greatly reduced loss when the valve is in its fully opened position. The ball 5 has a cutout 8 extending from the inlet opening of the channel 7 along the spherical surface0 hen the valve is fully closed as seen in Fig. 3, the inlet opening 13 communicates with the inner space 12 of the valve box 2 through the cutout 8 and channel 7, permitting the fluid on the inlet side to flow into the inner space 12. The valve box 2, sockets 3, 4, ball 5 and valve seat member 6 serving as the main components of the ball valve are all made of ceramics. Since these members to be brought into contact with the fluid are maoe of ceramics, the valve is resistant to corrosion even if the fluid is zn zcid or alkali. The ball 5 is cut out zt its top to provide a horizontal surface in which a bore 9 of square cross section is formed. h valve rod 30 has a lower end portion 31 having 2 square cross section and extending downward from a flange 32. The lower end portion 31 of the rod 30 is press fitted in the bore 9 of the rzll 5. The upper half portion of the rod 30 is circular in cross section and has an upper end portion 33 which is externally threaded. The valve box 2 has at its top portion vertical bore 22 through which the upper half portion of the valve rod 30 exTenos rotatably. The upper end portion 33 of the rod 30 projects upward from the box 2.The flange 32 has an upper surface in contact vlith an znnular packing 34 provided zround the lower end of the bore 22. An annular packing gland 35 is disposed in the bore 22 around the valve rod 30. The gland 35 is held in position by a holder nut 36 and z lock nut 37 which are screved on the upper end portion 33 of the rod 30.The valve rod 30 is connected at its upper end to the output shaft 39 of an actuator not shown by a coupl ing 38 Accordingly the ball 5 is horizontally rots table through the desired angle by the rod 30 and actuator The ceramic main components of the ball valve are housed in 2 cylinder 41 having annular projections 49 projecting diametrically outward from its opposite ends tach of the projections 49 has a slanting face 50 on its inner side and a thickness progressively decreasing diametrically outward. The outer end of each oftne sockets 3, 4 having a reduced outside diameter due to the provision of the stepped portion 17 is fittingly provided with an annular plate 43 and an annular flange 42 having a larder thickness than the plate 43. The flange 42 is formed on the inner side thereof along its oxter periphery with 2 stepped portion 48, to which the corresponding end of the cylinder 41 is fitted. The flange 42 has an annular projection 46 on its outer periphery. The projection 46 has a thickness progressively decreasing iametrically out ward and z slanting outer side face 47. A fastening ring 44 is provided to cover these projections 49, 46. The fastening ring 44 has inner side faces defining groove 45 and slanting in conformity with the slanting faces 50 znd 47. The fastening ring 44 comprises a pair of semi circular segments having lugs 51 project ire diametrically outward from their opposed ends. Each nzir of opposed lugs 51 are fastened together by a bolt 52 and 2 nut 53, whereby the cylinder 41 and each flange 42 are tightly held together by the fastening ring 44.Since the projections 49, 46 have the slanting fzces 50, 47 and the fastening ring 44 zlso have inner slanting side faces defining the groove 45, the cylinder 41 and the flange 42 can be joined together more tightly when the bolts 52 and the nuts 53 are tightened up with increased reassure. The fastening ring 44, which comprises z pair of semi circular segments, can be in the form of zn integral ring. Each of the annular plates 43 is formed with holes 55 for inserting therethrough elongated bolts 56.Each of the flanges 42 is zlso formed with holes 54 in rewriter vith the holes 55 and dimensioned to insert ti erein the heads of the elongated bolts 56 and nuts 57.The bolts 56 are inserted through the annular plates 43 on the inlet and outlet sides, and the slates 43 are connected together by the bolts 56 and nuts 57. The flanges 42 further has threaded bores 58 in which bolts not shov.n are screwed for connecting unillustrated pipes to the sockets 3, 4. In this vary, the main ceramic components of the ceramic ball valve are rigidly joined together by being subjected to a compressive force with the cylinuer 41, flanges 42, annular plates 43, fastening rings 44, elongated bolts 56, etc. Since no shearing force or tensile force is applied to join these main components, the components are unlikely to break. moreover the components are easy to assemble or disassemble.Preferably the cylinder 41, flanges 42, annular plates 432 fastening rings 44, elongated bolts 56, etc. are made from metal. When the ball 5 is rotate in the range of up to 90 degrees by the valve rod 30, the valve can be brought to any position between its fully opened position and fully closed position. When the ball valve is in its fully closed position as shown in Fig. 3, the inlet opening 13 is in co.mu nicatnon with the inner space 12 of the box 2 via the cutout 8 and fluid channel 7. The O ring 18 provides a small clearance between the recessed portion 16 formed in the inlet socket 3 and the valve seat member 6 placed in the recess 16, so that the clearance is also filled with the fluid in the inlet. The pressure of the inlet fluid therefore presses the valve seat member 6 against the ball 5. However, the inner space 12 is also full of the inlet fluid, which presses the valve seat member 6 toward the inlet.Consequently the valve seat member 6 is subjected to the same pressure on its opposite sides even if the inlet fluid has high pressure.It therefore follows that the valve seat member 6 is pressed against the ball 5 only by the resilient force of the 0 ring 18. Since the force of the 0 ring is not so great, the valve seat 26 is not pressed against the ball 5 with high pressure. Even if the valve is held closed for a prolonged period of time, the seat 26 will not engage the ball 5 tightly or unremovably, permitting smooth rotation of the ball 5. The valve is operable with small torque, i.e. by an actuator of small output. urthermore, the bored portion 9 of the ball 5, which is subjected only to 2 small force, remains free of damage. Although it appears likely that the pressure of the inlet fluid, which is delivered through the ball 5 to the valve seat 24 on the outlet socket 4, will produce great friction between the ball 5 and the seat .24, the arrangement of this invenTion serves to reduce the friction between the ball .5 and the seat 24. The above feature of this invention will be described below more specifically. It is assumed that te valve seat member 6 has an outside diameter D and an inside diameter d which is equal to the diameters of the inlet and outlet openings 13, 14. The areas of the circ les, S and T, having the diameters of D and d, respectively, are given by the following equations 5 E g2 1 4 T dê 2 4 The difference in pressure per unit area between the inlet side and the outlet side is assumed to be P, and the pressing force of the O ring 18, m. Un the assumption that the ball has no cutout 8, the axial components Q and R of the forces on the valve seat member 6 and on the valve seat 24 when the valve is in its closed position act from the inlet sice toward the outlet side and are given by the following equations see Fig. 4 Q S T P m 3 R S P 4 When the ball has the cutout 8, the above mentioned forces Q and R are given by the following equations see Fig. 5 Q m 5 R The 6 Thus it will be understood that the provision of the cutout 8 serves to reduce the forces acting between the spherical surface of the ball 5 and the valve seats 26, 24, consequently reducing the friction between the contact surfaces. The communication passage for holding the inlet opening 13 of the inlet socket 3 in communication with the inner space 12 of the valve box 2 when the ball 5 is in its valve closing position is not limited to the cutout 8. As seen in Fig. 6, for example, the ball 5 may be formed with a communication passage 28 intersecting the fluid channel 7 at right angles thereto. The passage 28 has one end opened to the fluid channel 7 and h s azother open end at the surface of the ball 5. Fig. 7 shows another embodiment. The ball 5 of this embodiment is not formed v ith 2 passage, such zs cutout 8 or communication passage 28. Th inlet is not proviced With the valve seat member 6, either. Instead, the socket 3 is formed around the inlet open ing 13 with a valve Ezat 23 in contact with the ball 5 and conforming to the shape of the srhtrical surface of the ball 5. The fluid channel 7 is circular in cross section. In the absence of the valve seat member, the axial force Q acting between the valve seat 23 of the socket 3 and the surface of the ball 5 is zero, except for the mechanical force applied to join the components of the ball valve The force P acting on the valve seat 24 is equal to the force given by the equation 6 It is also understood that also with this embodiment, the invention reduces the forces between the spherical surface of the ball 5 and the valve seats 23, 240 Fig. 8 shows another embodiment in which the valve box 2 and the sockets 3, 4 are tightly joined together by different fastening members A cylinder 61 covering the valve box 2 and the sockets 3, 4 has an internally threaded portion 63 at each of its opposite wends. dn annular flange 62 fitted to each of the sockets 3, 4 has an externally threaded portion 64 on the outer periphery thereof. The threaded portions 64 are screwed in the opposed threaded portions 63, whereby The valve box 2 and the sockets 3, 4 are rigidly joined together by 2 co tteesilte force.
