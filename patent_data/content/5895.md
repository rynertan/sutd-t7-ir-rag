# Track assembly element for a crawler vehicle.

## Abstract
A track assembly element 10 comprises a pair of laterally spaced links 13 releasably secured to each track shoe 12 thereof. A drive lug 17 extends between the links 13 and a rail 14 is disposed on each link 13 . A plurality of bolts 18,19 provide common fasteners for releasably securing the links 13 , track shoe 12 , drive lug 17 and rails 14 together. A pair of such bolts 18,19 are preferably disposed on each lateral side of each link 13 to increase the lateral stability of the links 13 and overall structural integrity of the track assembly element.
