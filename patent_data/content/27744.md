## Description
Heterocyclic Derivatives, Processes for the Production thereof and Pharmaceutical Compositions containing them. This invention relates to novel heterocyclic derivatives having action on histamine receptors, to processes for the preparation thereof, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to their use in therapeutics. Certain novel heterocyclic derivatives have now been found which have potent activity as H2 antagonists.These compounds, which are more particularly described below, for example show inhibition of the secretion of gastric acid when this is stimulated via histamine receptors Ash and Schild, Brit. J. Pharmacol, Chemother 1966, 27, 427 . Their ability to do so can be demonstrated in the perfused rat stomach using the method described in German Offenlegungsschrift No. 2,734,070, modified by the use of sodium pentobarbitone 50 mg kg as anaesthetic instead of urethane, and in conscious dogs equipped with Heidenhain pouches using the method described by Black et al, Nature 1972 236 385. Furthermore the compounds antagonise the effect of histamine on the contraction frequency of isolated guinea pig right atrium but do not modify histamine induced contractions of isolated gastro intestinal smooth muscle which are mediated via H1 receptors. Compounds with histamine H2 blocking activity may be used in the treatment of conditions where there is an advantage in lowering gastric acidity, particularly in gastric and peptic ulceration, as a prophylactic measure in surgical procedures, and in the treatment of allergic and inflammatory conditions where histamine is a known mediator. Thus they may be used for example, either alone, or in combination with other active ingredients in the treatment of allergic and inflammatory conditions of the skin. The present invention provides compounds of the general formula I EMI2.1 and physiologically acceptable salts, hydrates and bioprecursors thereof, in which one of R1 and R2 represents hydrogen, halogen or a C14 alkyl group which may be optionally substituted by hydroxy or C1 4 alkoxy, and the other represents the group R4 R5NAlk in which R4 represents hydrogen, C1 10 alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aralkyl, heteroaralkyl, trifluoroalkyl, or alkyl substituted by hydroxy, alkoxy, amino, alkylamino, dialkylamino or cycloalkyl, and R5 represents hydrogen or a C14 alkyl group, or R4 and R5 may, together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, form a 5 to 10 membered ring which may be saturated or may contain at least one double bond1 may be unsubstituted or may be substituted by one or more C1 3 alkyl groups e.g. methyl, or a hydroxy group and or may contain another heteroatom, e.g.oxygen or sulphur Alk represents a straight or branched alkylene chain of 1 to 6 carbon atOms, preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms R3, which may be in either the 2 or 3 position, represents the group CH3 N X CH2 M NH 2 where X represents CH2 0 or S n represents zero, 1 or 2 m represents 2, 3 or 4 andZ represents either the groupEMI2.2 or the groupEMI2.3 where Y represents S, O, CHN02 or NRg where Rg is nitro, cyano, alkylsulphonyl or arylsulphonyl R6 represents hydrogen, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, alkoxyalkyl or aralkyl R7 represents hydrogen, alkyl, alkenyl, aralkyl or C 2 6 alkyl substituted by hydroxy or alkoxy and R8 represents hydrogen, alkyl, alkenyl, aralkyl, hydroxyalkyl, acyloxyalkyl, alkoxyalkyl, aryloxyalkyl, aralkyloxyalkyl, aminoalkyl, alkylaminoalkyl, dialkylaminoalkyl, hydroxy or alkoxy, or the group NR1OR1 where R10 represents hydrogen, alkyl, alkyl substituted by hydroxy or C13 alkoxy, alkenyl, aralkyl or heteroaralkyl, and R11 represents any of the groups defined for R10 or may represent COR12 where R12 represents hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, aralkyl, alkoxy, heteroaryl or heteroaralkyl, or R11 represents the group S02R13 where R13 represents alkyl or aryl, orR11 represents the groupEMI3.1 where E represents oxygen or sulphur, and R14 represents hydrogen, alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl or aralkyl, or R10 and R11 taken together represent the group CR15R16 where R15 represents aryl or heteroaryl andR16 represents hydrogen or alkyl, with the provisos that where R2 represents the group R4R5NAlk then R3 is in the 2 position and where R2 represents hydrogen then R3 is in the 3 positiOn. The term alkyl as a group or part of a group means that the group is straight or branched and has unless otherwise stated 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and in particular 1 to 4 carbon atoms e.g. methyl or ethyl and the terms alkenyl and alkynyl mean that the group has 3 to 6 carbon atoms. The term 11cycloalkyl means that the group has 3 to 8 carbon atoms. The term aryl as a group or part of a group preferably means phenyl or substituted phenyl, for example phenyl substituted with one or more C13 alkyl or C13 alkoxy groups or halogen atoms e.g. fluorine. The acyl portion of an acyloxyalkyl group means an aroyl, aralkanoyl or C1 6 alkanoyl group. Examples of acyloxyalkyl groups include acetoxymethyl, formyloxymethyl, benzoyloxymethyl and phenylacetoxymethyl.The term heteroaryl as a group or part of a group within the definition of R4 and P8 means a 5 or 6 membered monocyclic unsaturated ring which may contain one or more heteroatoms selected from oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur, e.g. furyl, pyridyl, thiazolyl or thienyl. The heteroaryl ring may be unsubstituted or substituted by C 1 3 alkyl, C13 alkoxy, hydroxy, aminoalkyl, alkylaminoalkyl, dialkylaminoalkyl or halogen. The alkyl portion of a heteroaralkyl group is a straight or branched C1 4 alkyl chain, and. the heteroaryl ring is linked to the alkyl portion through either a carbon or nitrogen atom.

The compounds of formula I and their salts may also form hydrates, which hydrates are also to be considered as part of the invention.The compounds of formula I can exhibit tautomerism and the formula is intended to cover all tautomers. Where optical isomers may exist the formula is intended to cover all diastereoisomers and optical enantiomers.The term bioprecursors as used herein means compounds which have a structure different to that of the compounds of formula I but which, upon administration to an animal or human being, are converted in the body into a compound of formula I . The compounds according to the invention preferably in the form of a salt, may be formulated for administration in any convenient way and the invention includes within its scope pharmaceutical compositions containing at least one compound according to the invention adapted for use in human or veterinary medicine. Such compositions may be formulated in a conventional manner using one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients. Such compositions may also contain if required other active ingredients, e.g. H1 antagonists. Thus the compounds according to the invention may be formulated for oral, buccal, topical,parenteral or rectal administration. Oral administration is preferred. For oral administration, the pharmaceutical composition may take the form of for example, tablets, capsules, powders, solutions, syrups or suspensions prepared by conventional means with acceptable excipients.For buccal administration the composition may take the form of tablets or lozenges formulated in conventional manner. The compounds of the invention may be formulated for parenteral administration by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form in ampoules, or in multi dose containers, with an added preservative.The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilising and or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for reconstitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g. sterile pyrogen free water before use. The compounds of the invention may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g. containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glyceride. For topical application, the compounds of the invention inlay be formulated as ointments, creams, gels, lotions, powders or sprays in a conventional manner. For internal administration a convenient daily dosage regime of the compounds according to the invention would be 2 to 4 doses to the total of some 5 mg. to 2 g per day, preferably 5 to 500 mg. per day, dependant upon the condition of the patient.

Compounds of formula IV may be prepared by reacting the amine III with a compound of formula V EMI13.3 where P is as defined in formula IV . The above reactions may be effected in the absence or presence of a solvent e.g. ethanol, dioxan, acetonitrile, water or aqueous ethanol at a temperature from ambient to reflux. In the absence of a solvent,the reaction may be carried out by heating a mixture of the reactants at for example 100 1200C. Compounds of formula I in which Z represents the groupEMI13.4 where P8 is other than an alkoxy or acyloxyalkyl group or the group N Cur1516 may be prepared by cyclisation of a compound of formula VI EMI13.5 in which V1 isEMI14.1 or NCN and yl is hydrogen where V is oxygen or sulphur andR1 8 is a group as defined in formula I for R8 or a group convertible thereto under the conditions of the cyclisation reaction or represents halogen or alkoxy or V1 is NH and yl isEMI14.2 In a particular embodiment of the above process compounds of formula I in which the group Z representsEMI14.3 where R8 is amino, hydroxy or a carbon linked group may conveniently be prepared by cyclisation of a compound of formula VII EMI14.4 where V11 represents the group NCN orEMI14.5 zl represents two hydrogen atOms. The reaction may be carried out in the absence or presence of a suitable solvent, for example, toluene, ethanol, methanol, isopropanol, acetonitrile or water, at a temperature from room temperature to reflux. It may be convenient to prepare in situ compounds of formula VII in which Z1 represents two hydrogen atoms by treating a compound of formula VII where Z1 represents a diva lent protecting group which can readily be removed to yield two hydrogen atoms, for example a benzylidene group, with an acid, e.g. hydrochloric acid, preferably with heating and under such conditions cyclisation to give compounds of formula I will normally occur. When preparing compounds of formula I in whichR8 is a hydroxyalkyl group it is preferable that in the intermediate VII the hydroxy group is in protected form e.g. as an acyloxy derivative such as an alkanoyloxy or aroyloxy derivative. The protecting group will normally be removed during the cyclisation process. Compounds of formula I where Alk represents CH2 and where Z represents the groupEMI15.1 in which P8 is other than the group N CR15Rl6 may be prepared by reducing the intermediate formed from reacting a compound of formula VIII EMI15.2 in which one of R1 1 and R1 2 represents hydrogen, halogen or a C 1 4 alkyl group which may be optionally substituted by hydroxy or C1 4 a lkoxy and the other represents the group CH0 with a reagent R4R5NH.Reaction may be effected by treatment with ammonia or an amine R4R5NH in a solvent e.g. tetrahydrofuran or an alkanol such as ethanol or methanol, followed by reduction e.g. with a hydride reducing agent such as an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal borohydride, e.g. sodium borohydride, or aluminium hydride or lithium aluminium hydride or with hydrogen and a metal catalyst e.g. palladium or platinum. Alternatively, for the production of compounds of formula I in which R8 is other than N CR15Rl6, a compound of formual I in which R4 is hydrogen may be reacted with an aldehyde R4 CHO under the reducing conditions described above, the group R4 having a meaning such that the resulting group 1 represents a group R P4CH2 as defined above. This method applies particularly to the preparation of compounds of formula I in which P4 is heteroaralkyl or an optionally substituted alkyl chain containing up to 10 carbon atoms. In certain instances compounds of formula I where Z represents the groupEMI16.1 may be prepared by methods involving interconversion of the substituent R8. Thus compounds in which P8 is an acyloxyalkyl group may be prepared by treating the corresponding hydroxyalkyl compound with an appropriate acid, e.g.acetic or benzoic acid at elevated temperatures e. g. 80 120 C in the absence or presence of a solvent such as toluene. Compounds of formula I in which R8 represents the group N CR15Rl6 may be prepared from compounds of formula I in which R8 is an NH2 group by reaction with an aldehyde or ketone R15Rl6C0 in a solvent such as benzene, ethanol, or methanol. The reaction is preferably carried out with heating, e.g. at reflux. Compounds of formula I in which P8 is the groupNR10 R11 where R11 is COR12 SO2 13 or C E NHR14 may be prepared by treating a compound of formula I in which R is the group NHR10 and R1, R2, R7 and R10 are as 8 defined in Formula I or are groups readily convertible thereto with a reagent capable of replacing the hydrogen atom in the group NHR1O by the group R11 where R is as defined above. Thus, for example, reaction with an activated derivative of either a carboxylic acid R12C00H or a sulphonic acid R13S03H or reaction with an isocyanate or isothiocyanate R14NCE in which R14 has any of the meanings defined for R14 in formula I except hydrogen or represents an alkali metal atom such as potassium or sodium or an alkoxycarbonyl group, e.g. ethoxycarbonyl, gives a compound of formula I in which R71 is respectively the group COR12, S02R13 or Or E NHR14. L 3 SO2 13 Suitable activated derivates include acid halides e.g. acid chlorides, alkylchloroformates, acid anhydrides including mixed anhydrides e.g. acetic formic anhydride , or esters such as alkyl esters, orthoesters and l alkyl 2 pyridinyl esters. The reaction with an acid halide is preferably carried out in the presence of a base e.g. an inorganic base such as sodium hydroxide or an organic base such as triethylamine or pyridine. The reaction with an alkylchloroformate is preferably carried out in the presence of a base, e.g. potassium carbonate or triethylamine, in a solvent such as dimethylformamide.The reaction with an acid anhydride may be carried out in the absence or presence of solvent such as pyridine. In the reaction with an isocyanate or isothiocyanate compounds of formula I in which R14 is other than hydrogen are conveniently prepared by carrying out the reaction in a solvent such as acetonitrile at an elevated temperature, e.g. reflux. Compounds of formula I in which R14 is hydrogen may be prepared by heating with an appropriate organic isocyanate or isothiocyanate such as ethylcarbonisothiocyanatidate, at an elevated temperature followed by hydrolysis of the resulting ester, for example with a base such as aqueous ethanolic sodium hydroxide. Compounds of formula I may also be prepared by treating a compound of formula I in which the group R4R5N is replaced by a quaternary ammonium group e.g. a trimethylammonium group with an amineR4R5NH. The reaction may be carried out by eating the quaternary ammonium compound in the amine e. g.at 100 to 120 C or the reaction may be carried out in the presence of a solvent such as an alkanol e.g.ethanol at reflux. This process is particularly applicable to compounds in which Alk is CH2. Amines of formula III may be made by a number of methods depending on the precise structure of the compound. Thus amines of formula IX EMI18.1 in which n is 1 or 2 and X is oxygen or sulphur may be prepared from the corresponding alcohol of formula X EMI18.2 in which n is 1 or 2. For example amines of formula IX in which n is 1 and X is sulphur may be prepared by reacting an alcohol of formula X in which n is 1 with an appropriate aminoalkane thiol salt e.g. cysteamine hydrochloride in a concentrated mineral acid e.g. hydrochloric acid . Amines of formula IX in which n is 2 and X is sulphur may be prepared by converting an alcohol of formula X in which n is 2 into the corresponding haloalkyl compound using for example thionyl chloride or phosphorus tri bromide, or mesylate by reaction with methanesulphonylchloride, followed by treatment with an appropriate aminoalkylthiol e.g. cysteamine in a solvent such as ethanol and in the presence of a base e.g. sodium ethoxide . Amines of formula IX in which n is 1 or 2 and X is oxygen may be prepared by treating an alcohol of formula X in which n is 1 or 2 with a suitable base e.g. potassium t butoxide in a solvent .e.g.dimethylformamide followed by the addition of an appropriate haloalkylamine e.g. chloropropylamine . The alcohols of formula X , as well as the intermediates XXII and XXIV below, may be made by a variety of processes based on conventional methods in thiophene chemistry Advances in Heterocyclic ChemistryVolume 1, 1963, page 2 116, Ed. A.R. Katritzky,Academic Press, London and New York and ComprehensiveChemistry Volume 4, page 787, Ed. P.G. Sammes, PergamonPress, Oxford . Some representative routes and reagents are given in each case. Alcohols of formula X in which R1 is the group pP R4RsNCH2, n is 1 and the hydroxymethyl substituent is in either the 2 or 3 position may be prepared by treating a compound of formula XI EMI19.1 with an amine R4R5NH under reducing conditions as described previously for the preparation of compounds of the invention, to give a thiophenemethanamine of formula XII which may be subsequently reacted with paraformaldehyde in a concentrated mineral acid e.g.hydrochloric acid and acetic acid to introduce the hydroxymethyl group at either the 2 or 3 position. Alcohols of formula X in which R2 is the group R4R5NCH2, n is 1 and the hydroxymethyl substituent is at the 2 position may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula XIII EMI19.2 with for example oxalyl chloride in a solvent e.g. benzene and preferably in the presence of a catalyst e.g. pyridine followed by treatment with an amine R4R5NH to give an amide of formula XIV which is subsequently reduced with a complex metal hydride e.g. lithium aluminium hydride in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran to give a compound of formula XV .EMI20.1 The 2 hydroxymethyl group is then introduced by reacting the compound of formula XV with formaldehyde or a precursor of formaldehyde such as paraformaldehyde, in a concentrated mineral acid, e.g. hydrochloric acid or acetic acid. Alcohols of formula X in which R1 is the group R4R5NCH2, R2 is hydrogen, n is 1 and the hydroxymethyl substituent is in the 3 position may be prepared from a thiophene 3 carboxylate of formula NVI EMI20.2 where P19 is an alkyl group. This compound is halomethylated e.g. chloromethylated using for example formaldehyde, or a precursor of formaldehyde such as paraformaldehyde, and gaseous hydrogen chloride in a solvent such as chloroform and in the presence of zinc chloride to give a compound of formula XVII .The amino group R4R5Nis then introduced into the compound of formula XVII by reaction with an amine R4R5NH, in a suitable solvent such as ether, to give a compound of formula XVIII EMI20.3 Introduction of the 3 hydroxymethyl group is effected by reduction of the 3 carboxylate using for example lithium aluminium hydride in a suitable solvent such as ether. Alcohols of formula X in which n is 2 may be prepared by lithiating a halothiophene of formula XIX EMI21.1 where Hal is halogen e.g. bromine using n butyl lithium in a suitable sovent e. g. tetrahydrofuran at a low temperature e, g. 78 , followed by treatment of the resulting lithio derivative XX with ethylene oxide in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, to give the desired hydroxyethyl compound X, n 2 . In a modification of this process a halothiophene of formula XIX in which R1 is a group convertible to R4R5NCH2 e.g. an aldehyde grouping protected as an acetal and the group Hal is at the 3 position may be lithiated and treated with ethylene oxide as described above to give a hydroxyethyl compound of formula XXI .EMI21.2 Subsequent treatment with an amine R R4R5 NH under reducing conditions as described previously tor preparing compounds of the invention affords an alcohol of formula X in which R1 is the groupR4R5NCH2, n is 2 and the hydroxyethyl substituent is at the 3 position. Amines of formula IX in which X is CH2 may be prepared from an appropriate haloalkylthiophene of formula XXII EMI22.1 in which Hal is halogen by treatment with for example potassium phthalimide in a solvent e.g. dimethylformamide , followed by deprotection of the phthalimido derivative using for example hydrazine hydrate. The haloalkylthiophenes of formula XXII may be prepared for example by treating a lithio derivative of formula XX with an, dihaloalkane e.g. Br CH2 num l Br in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran to give an intermediate of formula XXII . Amines of formula IX in which X is CH2 may also be prepared by methods involving conventional homolugation of an alkyl chain. Thus for example a haloalkyl e.g.chloroethyl thiophene of formula XXIII EMI22.2 may be treated with for example sodium cyanide in dioxan to give the corresponding cyanoethyl compound, which may then be reduced using for example lithium aluminium hydride in tetrahydrofuran to give the corresponding aminopropyl compound. Alternatively a chloroethyl compound of formula XXIII may be treated with malonic ester to give, after decarboxylation, the corresponding butyric acid derivative.This may be treated with thionyl chloride for example, followed by treatment with ammonia, to give the corresponding amide which may then be reduced using for example lithium aluminium hydride to give the corresponding aminobutyl compound. Amines of formula IX in which n is zero and X is oxygen may be prepared from an appropriate alkoxythiophene XXIV EMI22.3 Where W is a halogen atom e.g. chlorine or bromine or a leaving group e.g. mesylate , by a similar method to that described above for the preparation of amines of formula IX in which X is CH2 from the corresponding haloalkyl thiophene. Alkoxythiophenes of formula XXIV may be prepared for example by treating a halo e.g. bromo thiophene of formula XIX with a diol HO CH2 mOH in the presence of a base e.g. sodium hydride and cuprous oxide, and preferably with the addition of potassium iodide, to give a hydroxyalkoxy compound of formula XXV EMI23.1 which may be treated with for example, thionyl chloride, phosphorus tribromide or methanesulphonyl chloride to give the alkoxytbiophene of formula XXIV . Amines of formula IX in which n is zero and X is sulphur may be prepared by treating a lithio derivative of formula XX with elemental sulphur, followed by reaction with an appropriate haloalkylamine e.g. chloropropylamine preferably in protected form, e.g. as a phthalimide with subsequent cleavage of the phthalimide group using for example hydrazine hydrate. Compounds of formula I and amines of formula IX in which Alk is an alkylene group other than CH2 may be prepared from the intermediates described above in whichAlk is CH2 or a group convertible thereto e.g. an ester group by conventional means for ascending a homologous series. Thus for example a hydroxymethyl group may be converted into a chloromethyl group, which may then be converted into an aminoethyl or aminopropyl group by methods analogous to those described for amines of formula IX in which X is CH2, and thence into the group R4R5NAlk where Alk contains two or three methylene groups. Interemdiates of formulae VI and VII may be prepared from amines of formula IX by methods analogous to those described in British Patent Specification No. 2023133A and European Patent Specification Publication No. 0016565. Intermediates of formula VIII in which the aldehyde grouping is preferably in protected form e.g. as an acetal may be prepared by the methods described above for preparing compounds of the invention except that in the appropriate intermediates the group P 4R5 NAlk is replaced by a protected aldehyde group e.g. an acetal grouping . Where the product of any of the above processes is a free base and a salt is required, the salt may be formed in a conventional manner. Thus, for example, a generally convenient method of forming the salts is to mix appropriate quantities of the free base and the acid in an appropriate solvent s , e.g. an alcohol such as ethanol or an ester such as ethyl acetate. The invention is illustrated by, but not limited to, the following examples and Preparations.
