# Apparatus for detecting the reasonable condition of developer in a copying machine.

## Abstract
The gap 18 between a magnetic sensor 15 and a fit ting member 16 for fitting said magnetic sensor and the surface of said magnetic sensor are coated with thin non magnetic coating materials 17 having small surfacial fric tion to prevent the developer from being introduced into said gap and adhered thereto. The smooth flow of the developer can be kept and the always stable and accurate detection of the reasonable condition can be achieved.
