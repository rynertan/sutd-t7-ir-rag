# Amphibious vehicle with a bicycle or motor cycle structure.

## Abstract
An amphibious vehicle 1 with a bicycle or motorcycle structure 2 is described. The rear wheel 4 incorporates resistant elements 5 which act as spokes, each of which is enlarged at one end like a blade, and which propels the vehicle when the pedals are operated from the chassis of each of the wheels 3,4 there emerges one or more lateral resistant arms 6 , each of which has, at its ends, the corresponding floats 7 which keep the vehicle afloat, while each of the said arms 6 has an articulation which allows it to be folded sideways towards the wheel, so that the vehicle can be used as a bicycle. The system of pedalling 10 can be moved lengthwise on the chassis frame by way of a mechanism and which can be fixed in position depending on whether the vehicle is to run on land or on water.
