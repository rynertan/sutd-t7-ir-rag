## Description
IMPROVEMENT IN WHEELCHAIRS FOR DISABLED The object of the present invention is to improve wheelchairs for disabled. In particular, the invention relates to a wheelchair which has the peculiar characteristic of enabling movement in all directions, either horizontally, on the basis of already known technical principles, or, independently, vertically so that the patient may assume any position from lying horizontally to standing, using slow movements and without physical efforts. It is well clearthata solution like that provided by the present invention has the undeniable advantages of enabling the patient to become completely independent and of avoiding the patient having to remain for a long time in the same position. It is the specific object of the present invention a wheelchair for disabled constiting of a frame comprising a chair back, a seat, a leg rest and a foot rest connected to each other by hinges and two movable arms, characterized in comprising, in combination, bar and lever means, symmetrically positioned on both sides of the wheelchair and connected to each other horizontally by means of bars which are fixed to the frame in such a way that the motion of any one of said elements of the wheelchair will result in the motion of all the others, actuator means which control the abovesaid movements and means to control the actuator means themselves. Preferably, according to the invention, said actuator means are constituted by two linear electromagnetic actuators, one of which is hinged to the wheelchair seat while the other is hinged close to the leg rest. Working of one or the other of said actuators determines the motion of all the elements constituting the wheelchair from a horizontal position to a vertical one. The main advantage of having equipped the wheelchair with linear electromagnetic actuators lies in the fact that in case of failure the wheelchair will remain temporarily blocked as it is and will not return abruptly to its original position, creating the easily imaginable consequences for the patient. Moreover, according to the invention, said bar and lever means, which are positioned symmetrically owe both sides of the wheelchair, include a horizontal bar, placed parallel to the seat and displaced towards the bottom, connected, at one end, to said seat by means of a semicircular bar and, in front, at the other end, to the leg rest, a profiled lever hinged, above, to said horizontal bar and, below, to the foot rest, transversal bars being provided for connecting the two symmetrical bar and lever systems rigidly together. It should be noted that, according to the present invention, a second foot rest, parallel to the abovesaid one, slightly higher up and rigidly fixed to the leg rest, is provided in order to avoid the weight of the legs on the first foot rest from having any effect on the inclination of the system of parallelisms. According to the invention said means to control the actuator means are advantageously a puÂµubutton control positioned on the arms, or levers, also positioned on the arms, or muscular impulse control, or vocal vibration control, or vocal code control means or remote drive control. In a preferred embodiment two belts on the chair back and on the leg rest are provided so as to prevent the patient from slipping down from the wheelchair when in a vertical position. According to another preferred embodiment of the wheelchair of the present invention, said wheelchair comprises, in combination, two rear load bearing wheels equipped with external rings, two front loadbearing idle wheels, one or two front rubber castors under the foot rest, two independent electrical motor reduction units to control mo tion on the ground, a frame built with tubular elements to which the chair back, the seat, the leg rest, the foot rest and the two movable arms are attached, two actuator means fixed, respectively, to the seat and to the leg rest, bar means and lever means hinged to said chairback, leg rest and foot rest, and means to control said actuator means. The invention will be disclosed, for illustrative and not for limitative purposes, according to some preferred embodiments with specific reference to the figures of the drawings enclosed, wherein figure 1 is a lateral schematic view of the wheelchair according to the invention figure 2 is a schematic plan view of the wheelchair of figure 1 figures 3, 4 and 5 illustrate, in a schematic way, how the wheelchair work and figure 6 is a schematic lateral view of a second embodiment of the wheelchair according to the invention. With particular reference to figure 1, reference 1 indicates the chair back of the wheelchair of the invention and reference 2 indicates one of the two movable arms. As it can be seen, the seat 7 and horizontal bar 5 are connected, hinged in 3 and 4 respectively, by means of a semicircular shaped bar 8 . In front, said horizontal bar 5 is hinged in 1O , being so connected to leg rest 11 . In a parallel direction with respect to leg rest 11 , a shaped lever 16 is provided hinged to the leg rest in 14 and to the foot rest in 15 . By means of these parallelisms made of said bars and levers, which are provided symmetrically on both sides of the wheelchair, it is possible to ensure that the movement of only one among chair back 1 , seat 7 , leg rest 11 or foot rest 12 will automatically determine the position of the other parts. Figure 1 also schematically illustrates the rear load bearing wheels 17 , the front idle load bearing wheels 18 and the centraI load bearing wheel 19 . The foot rest 20 is provided to avoid the weight of the patient on foot rest 12 from having any effect on the inclination of the other parts. The motive power necessary for the horizontal and vertical J movements of the wheelchair is generated by an accumulator 21 figure 2 . All of the horizontal movements can be obtained by means of the separate controls 22 fixed to the frame near each rear wheel 17 which enable forward and backward motion of the wheelchair.Rotational motion is transmitted to the rear wheels 17 by means of a roller 13 keyed to the shaft projecting from the motor,reduct ion unit and compressed by a spring not shown . Figure 3 shows the linear actuators 23 and 24 hinged to the seat 7 in 25 and to the leg rest 11 in 26 . Said actuators 24 and 25 are fixed below to the wheelchair frame 6 in 27 and 28 . In figure 3 the patient is in a seated position. The arrow indicates the motion that the arms 2 can make. Acting on the control not shown , the patient can operate actuator 24 , which in its turn, takes effect on the leg rest 11 and, consequently, by means of the parallelisms illustrated in figure 1, on the foot rest 12 , the seat 7 , and the chair back 1 , so that the patient can assume any one of the intermediate positions between the one shown in figure 3 and the one shown in figure 4. In its turn, by operating the actuator 23 , hinged in 25 to the seat 7 , the patient is enabled to assume position which vary between those in figures 3 and 5, due to the presence of the abovesaid parallelisms. It should be noted that, as illustrated in figure 5, when the patient stands, the idle anterior wheels 18 are raised from the ground and the equilibrium of the wheelchair is ensured by the anterior castor 19 . Figure 6, instead, shows an embodiment of the wheelchair according to the invention, which differs from the one described previously only in some of its constructional aspects, the main features which embody the innovative quality of the invention remaining unaltered. In particular, it can be seen that the profile of frame 6 has been modified in its external form. This second embodiment allows advantageously to house in 29 a number of accumulators 21 , see figures 2 and 3 , greater than one. To this end, it may be noted that actuator 23 can be fixed 32 , instead of in 27 as in the case of the previous embodiment. The semicircular shape bar 8 is in this case, replaced by a bar 30 which has the shape of a seven . Another constructive aspect which differs from the previously described embodimentisthemewhich concerns the position of castor 19 . In fact, in this case, the castor 19 is mounted on axis with the lever 11 , instead of at the end of the foot rest 12 and is joined to the lever 11 by means of the element 31 which is slidable externally along said lever 11 . The element 31 is hinged to the lever 16 in 15 in such a way that when the patient brings himself into an erect position see figure 5 equilibrium continues to be safeguarded by front castor 19 . This second embodiment is particularly suitable for street transportation both because of the possibility to provide for more than one accumulator 21 and because of the position of castor 19 . The present invention has been described with special referen ce to some of its specific embodiments but it is to be intended that variations and modifications may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from its scope.
