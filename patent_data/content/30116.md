# Method of manufacturing a semiconductor device having a patterned multi layer structure.

## Abstract
A layer 13, of poly crystal silicon for example, is etched using a thin photoresist film 15 as a mask. The layer 13 is first etched part way through by isotropic etching, then the remainder of the layer 13 is etched through by anisotropic etching in the direction of thickness of the layer 13. The side walls of a window formed in layer 13 in this way are tapered or inclined so that when an insulation layer 14 and a wiring layer 16 are subsequently formed, there is no danger of shorting of wiring layer 16 to poly crystal silicon layer 13 due to thinning of insulation layer 14 at the edges of the window. The isotropic etching and the anisotropic etching can in many cases be carried out in one and the same dry etching apparatus.
