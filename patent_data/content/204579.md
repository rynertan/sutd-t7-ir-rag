# IMMUNOASSAY INCUBATION DEVICE

## Abstract
An immunoassy incubation device is employed for detecting the presence of specific analytes in solid and semisolid compositions using solid phase immunoassay methods. Analysis of such compositions by solid phase immunoassay first requires that soluble or particulate ana lytes be extracted from the sample composition. A represen tative example of such compositions is fecal material. The immunoassay incubation device includes a vessel 1 for homogenizing the sample composition. The device also includes a solid phase assay member 7 immunologically sensitized for detecting particular analytes. After the sample composition is homogenized, the assay member is incu bated in an incubation chamber 5 which is emersed into the homogenate within the homogenization vessel. The incuba tion chamber 5 includes a screen 6 which screens out unextracted components from the homogenate while pas sing extracted components. The invention discloses that contact with unextracted components from such composi tions can degrade the accuracy of solid phase immuno assays.
