# Folder.

## Abstract
A folder 10 comprises a folder stock 12 having two sheets 13, 14 joined together to form a bottom 15 , and a vertical panel 32 secured to an upper end of one sheet 14 of the folder stock. A pair of rails 22, 24 at the upper ends 16, 17 of both sides maintain the folder suspended such that the bottom section 15 is below said upper ends 16, 17 and the panel 32 extends in a generally vertical direction. The vertical panel 32 includes pockets 38, 40, 42, 44 for holding magnetic media, such as diskettes 50, 52 . The folder 10 permits storing magnetic media, such as diskettes 50, 52 together with the associated materials without the danger of warping or permanently distorting the diskette. It also prevents the transfer of static electricity from the papers stored in the folder stock to the diskettes stored in the pockets of the vertical panel 32 .

## Description
FOLDER This invention relates to folders. In particular, it relates to folders for storing magnetic media, such as diskettes, floppy discs and mag cards, together with the materials relating thereto, such as correspondence and other documentation papers. In recent years there has been a tremendous increase in the use of magnetic media, such as diskettes, floppy discs, or mag cards. This creates a need for storing such media in an efficient manner. Frequently, papers and other materials need to be stored together with such magnetic media. For such storage the prior art provides plastic folders containing single pockets for storing both the medium and the related papers.The folder is suspended at its upper corners on a frame and the diskette or another medium and the related papers are stored together in the pocket. Hereinafter the references will be made to diskettes as a primary example of magnetic media. The prior art single pocket folders permit the storage of diskettes together with the related papers but they suffer from several disadvantages. Specifically, the papers inserted next to the diskette tend to distort the diskette, expecially if the folder is overstuffed with paper. Such distortion can cause a permanent bending or warping of the diskette which in turn could destroy the usefulness thereof. Another disadvantage of the prior art single pocket folders is that static electricity can be created by the paper. This static electricity is transmitted to the diskette which can damage the recording. There is therefore a need for a folder for storing diskettes and related papers which would not suffer from above stated disadvantages. The invention provides a folder for storing diskettes and related papers comprising a folder stock having a first sheet and a second sheet joined together to form a bottom, said first side having a first upper end and said second side having a second upper end a panel means for securing the panel to said first upper end on the opposite side of said first sheet means for suspending said folder such that said first and said second ends of said folder stock are above said bottom and said panel extends in a generally vertical direction and means for holding diskettes on the side of the panel opposite from said folder stock. The two ends of the folder may be secured to rails which suspend the folder from frames, such that papers and other materials can be stored in the folder stock The panel may be mounted in the vicinity of one end of the folder stock, and preferably extends doamward in a generally vertical direction. At least one pocket may be provided on the side of the panel opposite to the folder stock to accomodate diskettes which are related to the papers stored in the folder stock. The invention further provides a folder for storing diskettes and related papers comprising a paper folder stock having a rectangular sheet side and a rectangular second sheet, said sheets being joined together to form a bottom, said first sheet having a first upper end, said second sheet having a second upper end a plastic panel having at least one pocket therein for holding diskettes G first rail for securing said plastic panel to said first upper end such that said panel is on the side of said first sheet opposite from said second sheet and said pocket is on the side of said panel opposite from said first sheet a second rail secured to said second upper end a first set of glides secured to and extending on either side of said first upper end a second set of glides secured to and extending on either side of said second upper end, said first and said second set of glides being provided for suspending said folder on a wire frame such that said bottom is below said first and said second upper ends and a storage space is formed between said first and said second sheets, and such that said plastic panel extends from said first rail in a generally vertical direction so that diskettes placed in said pockets are not distorted by paper materials stored in said folder stock and static electricity is not transmitted from said paper materials to diskettes stored in said panel. The folder of the present invention permits keeping diskettes with the related papers without subjecting the diskettes to distortion or warping. The folder also eliminates transmittal of static electricity from the papers to the diskettes stored in the same folder. Preferred embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which FIGURE 1 is a perspective view of a folder constructed in accordance with the present invention, FIGURE 2 is a cross sectional view of the folder ofFIGURE 1 taken along line 2 2 thereof, and FIGURE 3 is a front view of another folder constructed in accordance with the present invention. Referring now to FIGURE 1, the improved folder of the present invention is designated generally by a numeral 10. The folder includes a folder stock 12 which is made of first and a second rectangular sheets 13 and 14, respectively, which are joined together to form a bottom 15. The first sheet has a first upper end 16. The second sheet has an upper end 17. The bottom 15 is situated beneath the two ends 16 and 17. The end 16 is mounted to a rail 22. The rail 22 inclndes at both ends nylon glides 26 and 28, which permit sliding of the rail along wire frames 29 and 30. The end 17 and an upper end of a rectangular panel 32 are secured to a rail 24 which extends between wire frames 28,30 and is slidingly mounted thereon by nylon glides 34 and 36. The plastic panel 32 includes pockets 38, 40, 42 and 44. The pockets 38 and 40 accomodate diskettes such as diskettes 50 and 52. The pockets 42 and 44 are provided for indexing. The papers related to the diskettes are stored in the space defined between the two vertical sheets 13 and 14 of the folder stock 12. Thus, the folder 10 permits storage of the diskettes together with the related papers. As can be seen from FIG. 2, the plastic panel 32 and the diskettes stored therein are not distorted by papers placed in the folder stock. Even a large volume of papers does not cause bending or warping of the diskette as the panel 32 is free to rotate about the rail 24. This feature of the invention assures that the diskettes are not distorted and are not subsequently permanently warped because of the papers stored in the folder. Additionally, since the papers stored in the folder stock are separated from the diskettes by the folder stock and by the plastic panel, the static electricity is not transmitted to the diskettes. As shown in FIG. 2, the folder 10 of the preferred embodiment of the invention depicted in FIGURES 1 2 is made of the following materials. The folder stock 12 is made of paper. The rectangular plastic panel 32 contains anti static agents and therefore it further reduces the risk that static electricity could be transmitted from the papers to the diskettes stored in the same folder. The panel 32 is made of rigid vinyl and pockets 38, 40, 42 and 44 are made of flexible vinyl. The rails 22 and 24 are constructed of metal. The second embodiment of the present invention is depicted in FIG. 3. The folder 110 is substantially identical to that shown in FIGURES 1 and 2 except that it contains a single diskette pocket 160 in the panel 132 which is secured to the rest of the folder 110 in the same manner as panel 32 is secured to the rest of the folder 10. The pocket 160 accomodates a large diskette 162. The folder 110 also includes an indexing pocket 165. Many changes and modifications will occur to those skilled in the art upon studying this disclosure. All such changes and modifications that fall within the spirit of the present invention are intended to be included within its scope as defined by the appended claims.
