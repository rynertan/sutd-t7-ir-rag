# Arrangement for bidirectional information transfer on a single direction bus.

## Abstract
A processing unit is interconnected with an operator console by an interface bus 13 of finite capacity and transfer of information is normally in a preferred direction from the processing unit to the console. Provision is made to transfer other information from the console to the processing unit without impacting the bus by utilizing a normally con tinuously operating counter 11 in the processing unit and a comparator 12 in the console. The console comparator 12 compares count signals on 13a from the counter 11 with locally generated digital signals on 14 representative of keyboard depressions and provides a stop signal to the processing unit counter over a single line 15 when an equal compare occurs. The processing unit can then interrogate the counter 11 at a convenient time and confirm a valid entry by operating indicators, such as visual and or audible means in the console and the interface bus capacity is not impacted by the transfer of the other information from the console.
