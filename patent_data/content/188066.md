# Crank mechanism.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a crank mechanism for enabling a crankpin to follow other than a circular path centred on the cranking axis. The mechanism comprises a crankshaft skeleton 10 defining at least one main bearing section 12 and one web 14 extending radially from the main bearing section 12 . A housing 20 is mounted for sliding movement along the web 14 has a crankpin 32 secured thereto. Slidable guiding means 40, 46 are provided to cause the housing 20 to slide along the web 14 in synchronism with the rotation of the skeleton 10 , such that the distance of the centre of the crankpin 32 from the centre of the main bearing section 12 varies as a function of the cranking angle.
