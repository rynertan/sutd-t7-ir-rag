Openings 22, 16 are formed in the wall of the intake barrel 10 at the upstream and donwstream sides of the venturi member 12 . A bypass passage forming member 28 provided with a groove 26 of a length greater than the distance between said openings 22, 16 is fixed to the outside of the intake barrel 10 . A bypass passage 34 is formed by these openings 22, 16 and the groove 26 . A spacer 32 is interposed between the intake barrel 10 and the bypass passage forming member 28 . The cross sectional area of the bypass passage 34 can be varied by varying the thickness of the spacer 32 .
