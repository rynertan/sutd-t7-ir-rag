# PEN TYPE CODE READER

## Abstract
A pen type bar code reader uses a reflector formed on a concave lens surface of a convex lens system with respect to a bar code detector, except a region for transmitting a light flux. The convex lens system is mounted so that its optical axis is angled with respect to the light flux from the detector, and a bar code illuminating light source is provided in a position between the detector and the convex lens system and opposite to the light flux from the detector with respect to the optical axis of the convex lens system.
