# Process for preparation of vessel closures provided with liners and bottles sealed by such closures.

## Abstract
An improvement in the ability of a liner of a vessel closure to resist cracking and to retain its adhesion to a vessel closure shell over a period of time can be achieved by spreading a mass 4 of a thermoplastic resin over an appropriate part of the inner face of the shell 1 whilst maintaining the mass molten, prior to press moulding the mass under cooling into the shape of the liner. A punch 5 incorporating a heater 2 can be used to spread the molten mass. Vessel closures prepared in this way can be used to seal bottles of drink.
