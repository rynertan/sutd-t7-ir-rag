## Description
THE STABILIZATION OF WORKING REAGENT SOLUTIONS CONTAININGNADH, NADPH, AND OR ENZYMES, AND THE.USE OF SUCH STABILIZED REAGENTS IN ENZYME OR SUBSTRATE ASSAYSI. Background of the Invention Enzymes, Their Use and Measurement I.A. Introductory Comments of Background, and of Vital Significance of Enzymes Enzymes have been used for many years, in reagents in various biological and chemical assays and these many uses of enzymes have long included the quantitative measurement of a wide variety of substances in blood, tissue fluids, and in other substances in which measurements of constituents are desired.The measutrements involving enzyme activity have thus been long in use for vital diagnostic medical purposes and for medical research for enzyme reactions have been long known to be reactions by which the measurement or quantitation of diagnostically significant body substances can be done.These assays which involve enzyme reactions are, accordingly, of very useful and medically vital purposes for they are useful in the quantitative measurement of blood enzymes and enzymes of ether body fluids, and also to give a quantitative measurement of even non enzyme substances. However, a particular and long standing problem of the attempts at accurate measurement of many blood enzymes is that unfortunately they manifest no easily perceived indication of their presence or activity and thus in these instances their activity is coupled with reagent enzymes which are of a type or nature which do have an associated measurable change incident to their reaction.I.B. Enzyme Systems of Coupled Nature Illustrate Enzyme Procedures The coupling of one enzyme to another is an indirect yet very useful reaction, used in assay techniques and it involves the allowing or use of a product of a first enzyme reaction to serve as a substrate or intermediate product upon which a second enzyme acts, producing yet another product, and one of the products of the second reaction is the thing whose measurement provides in effect a desired quantitation or measurement of the particular factor of interest of the first reaction.As an illustrative example, the directly measurable factor of a coupled enzyme reaction is a change in the spectrophotometric absorbance de to the production or consumption of the substance NADH nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, reduced form or NADPH nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, reduced form which is quantitatively measurable by its characteristic of absorbing strongly in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum, and thus the measured change of that absorbance is useful to give the quantitative indication of the NADH reaction involved.I.B.1 Coupled Enzyme System to Measure Enzyme SGOT An example of the indirect measurement of an enzyme, of a coupling enzyme reaction type, is the indirect yet quantitative measurement of the very significant blood enzymeSGOT serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase . That enzyme SGOT is a substance which is very important medically, for it is released into the blood stream when a person s heart is damaged and therefore it has the vital medical diagnosis significance of being a measure of the incidence and or extent of myocardial infarction commonly called heart attack . And, as has been long known, a prompt and accurate measurement of apparent heart damage is vital as a means of diagnosis and treatment of the heart malfunction and since treatments vary according to what is the nature and extent of the specific malfunction which causes the heart damage symptoms, the prompt and accurate SGOT measurement is of vital healthimproving and even life saving significance to the patient.The enzyme SGOT is measured by its role in catalyzing the first of the reactions mentioned below, and a second enzymeMDH malic dehydrogenase is used to catalyze a reaction involving a product of the SGOT reaction and thus these two reactions illustrate not only a vitally significant measurement of SGOT and apparent heart damage, but illustrate also the use of one enzyme MDH to measure another enzyme SGOT in an indirect or coupled enzyme system reaction phenomenon.The SGOT reaction may be represented as follows aspartic acid glutamic acid SGOT alpha ketoglutaric acid pyridoxa oxaloacetic acid 5 phosphateHowever, an indirect method of measurement is here required, because none of the participating substances for this SGOT reaction nor the products of that reaction are easily measured.Thus the measurement of the diagnostically important SGOT activity must be coupled with a second reaction which is easily measured and commonly that second reaction is one using the enzyme MDH as a catazst, as follows oxaloacetic acid malic acid EMI4.1 NADH NADThe loss in ultraviolet absorbance of NADH, incident to its conversion tp NAD, is something which is easily measured and thus this reaction, catalyzed by the MDH, provides the desired although indirect quantitation of the activity of the amount of SGOT in the blood, and thus gives the observer the vital data as to the heart damage.I.B.2 Coupled Enzyme System Using LDH to Measure Enzyme SGPT Another illustration of a coupled enzyme system, using one enzyme LDH to measure another enzyme SGPT , is that of the indirect assay for SGPT, vitally significant in diagnosis of liver diseases as well as diagnosis of myocardial infarction, as follows alpha ketoglutaric acid L glutamate EMI4.2 L alanine pyruvateSimilar to the SGOT example given above, none of the participating substances for this SGPT reaction nor its reaction products are easily measured, and thus a second reaction using LDH as catalyst must be coupled with the first reaction to get an easily measurable product, as follows pyruvate NADH EMI4.3 Lactate NAD The loss in ultraviolet absorbance of NADH is easily measured and this reaction, catalyzed by LDH, provides a useful although indirect quantitation of the amount ofSGPT in the blood. I.C. Enzymesin Measurement of Non Enzyme Substances Enzymes are also used as reagents to measure non enzyme substances which are not easily detected by ordinary colorproducing dye reactions and or in cases where other substances are mistakenly measured by such reactions as supposedly being the substance for which the measurement was intended. More particularly, the known high specificity of enzymes is used to convert substances to be measured in the blood to a compound which can be easily and specifically measured.In other cases, the enzyme reagent produces an easily measurable change while converting the substance of interest in whatever is the particular reaction. The widely used hexokinase measurement of blood glucose is an example glucose ATP hexokinase W glucose 6 phosphate glucose 6 phosphate G 6 PDH NADH NAD gluconolactone 6 phosphateThus, two enzyme reagents are used to convert glucose to gluconolactone 6 phosphate. The NADH formed absorbs ultraviolet light strongly and the spectrophotometric absorbance at 340 nm is thus useful as a measurable determina tion of the glucose concentration in the blood sample used. II. The Vital Significance of Long Stability of Enzymes as Reagents II.A. Magnitude A wide variety of diagnostic tests or assays have for many years been performed in hospital and clinical laboratories, using enzymes as reagents. About 300 million such diagnostic tests are performed on blood samples by such laboratories each year in the United States and the quantity approaches a billion of such tests annually worldwide. II.B. Stability Distinctions between Dry Stock Enzyme Reagents and that of Working Reagent Solutions Because of the stability problem short shelf life of enzymes in the liquid solution form in which they are used, reagent enzymes used in these tests are generally supplied in the dry form.This dry form storage method, although beneficial in prolonging the enzyme stability, has a great disadvantage of causing the laboratory to have to then reconstitute the enzyme reagent with water to obtain a working reagent for use in the assay. A working reagent , more fully described below, is one which is added to the diagnostic test directly, without additional preparation. Working enzyme reagents are desirably used in these tests or assays in the form of a liquid solution, for reasons such as ease of handling and measured delivery but in such form of liquid solution such enzyme reagents are characteristically stable for only a few hours and at most a few days, even under refrigeration. And use of enzyme reagents at the more convenient room temperature may drastically reduce stability even further.II.C. Stability Herein Used in Month long Sense Stability of working enzyme reagents is herein meant to refer to the retention of the utility of those enzyme reagents in performing clinical assays at some period of time generally being about one month after preparation in yielding clinically useful diagnostic results.II.D. Known Instability Disadvantages of Working Reagent Solutions Here Overcome At best, the instability of relatively expensive enzyme reagents creates economic waste, since the unused reagent must be discarded. At worst, the unstable reagent may cause a mistaken diagnostic measurement to be made for enzyme reagents which have lost activity may cause falsely elevated or decreased measurements. Deterioration may also have the effect of altering the range of the assay, so that a severe abnormality may be reported as normal or only slightly elevated and this of course causes a wrong diagnosis which may have many dangerous or at least bothersome effects.Further, the short stability of course leads to the relatively expensive and bothersome laboratory procedure of reagent preparation in relatively small batches.These many disadvantages of short stability of enzyme reagents seem so evident that further emphasis seems unnecessary, except perhaps to mention that false assay valuation may of course result in missing the detection of a disease state in a patient or in falsely diagnosing a disease state which does not exist. And although early diagnosis of disease is of course generally believed to be desirable, erroneous diagnostic information may delay proper diagnosis, and may cause expensive, damaging or uncomfortable treatment to be given for a disease which does not exist.Such disadvantages of short stability enzyme reagents have been long realized.In spite of all this, increasing dependence upon laboratory diagnostic blood tests in the practice of medicine has caused the prior art both to use short stability enzyme reagents in spite of these disadvantages, and to attempt to utilize various types of procedures and concepts to lengthen enzyme stability to as long as possible, even though such attempts have generally not accomplished working reagent stability for more than a few hours or at most a day, even under refrigeration. III. Prior Art as to Stabilization of NADH Reagents and Comments as to NADH Instability Reagents containing NADH pose two particular stability problems which are advantageously overcome by the concepts of this invention.As to the problems of NADH stability, the prior art has suggested that NADH solutions are more stable at akaline pH levels as contrasted to acid pH values. Also it is known that NADH is more stable in Tris buffer used in working reagents than in water. The Tris buffer is believed to be commonly used in a concentration of about 0.1 M for purpose of maintaining pH of the enzyme assay. However, the prior art has not produced an NADH working reagent solution which is stable and free from one or both types of deterioration, described below, for prolonged periods of time.As mentioned above, the property which makes NADH and theNADPH useful in coupled enzyme reactions is its absorbance of ultraviolet light. A first source of instability inNADH is the loss of optical density O.D. in a solution of NADH, due to loss of ability to absorb ultraviolet light, the O.D. of a solution being a function of its ability to absorb ultraviolet light. The result is a loss of ability to detect enzyme activity.For example, a freshly prepared solution may have a O.D.of 2.0. Such a solution might detect enzyme or substrate levels which produced a change from 2.0 down to 0.5 O.D.If, because of aging, the O.D. of the working reagent solution decays to 1.0 O.D. from 2.0, the reagent system can only measure one third that is, 0.5 O.D. 1.5 O.D. as high a level of enzyme or substrate.If a fresh reagent system for SGOT were capable of detecting abnormal levels of three times normal, such decay would allow measuring only one times normal, and abnormal levels would not be detected and since levels of three times normal would be seen in a severe heart attack, whereas normal SGOT levels are rarely seen in severe heart attacks, the physician might be led to a tragically mistaken diagnosis.A second type of deterioration in working reagents containing NADH is the formation of inhibitors. The loss of O.D.type of deterioation is believed by applicant to happen either with or without inhibitor formation and inhibitor formation is believed by applicant to occur either with or without loss of ultraviolet U.V. absorbance. Inhibitor formation in NADH solution causes a lowering of rate in the enzyme reactions which which the NADH is coupled.As an Example, a NADH working reagent solution which has deteriorated by way of inhibitor formation, if used with even fresh working reagents containing the other ingredients for an SGOT test, will produce lower apparent SGOT results. Consequently, a laboratory might mistakenly report a normalSGOT value on a patient with acute heart disease even though he has an elevated blood level of SGOT.IV. Characteristics or Nature of Enzyme Instability and Prior Art as to Enzyme Stabilization Attempts IV.A. Instability of Working Solutions in Prior Art It is known, as mentioned above, that when enzymes are in aqueous solutions, they rapidly lose their activity. Thus, reagents so prepared decay because of loss of enzyme activity, and after a short period of time, they cannot and should not be used, due to such activity loss for a loss of enzyme activity, of such significant amount, often occurs in as short a period of time as a few hours, even when the enzyme reagent is refrigerated.Refrigeration of aqueous solutions of enzymes has been known by the prior art to relatively prolong stability to a certain extent. However, even under careful refrigeration, enzyme solutions generally lose substantial activity in only a few hours or at most one day.IV.B. Inherent Nature of Enzyme Instability Indeed, since all enzymes come from natural sources such as plant, animal, and microbial life, it seems that the wellknown property of instability of enzymes in aqueous solutions is inherently natural. and vitally important in such life forms, even though the present inventive concepts achieve a result quite opposite to this apparently natural characteristic of enzymes.In nature, enzymes are used by living organisms to synthesize and catabolize virtually every compound making up the organism, as well as to control energy utilizations and an important means which seemingly is inherently employed in nature to control such life processes is the control of enzyme production or synthesis. If, in nature, enzymes were totally stable in the aqueous media which makes up the internal environment of all life, their level would never be reduced, only increased, and consequently control of metabolic processes would be lost.IV.C. Working Reagent Solutions are the Desired Form for Use As a result of this inherent and natural enzyme instability in an aqueous solution, considerable amount of time must be spent in preparation of fresh aqueous enzyme reagent systems known as working reagents . A working reagent is one which is used in an as is condition in an enzyme assay test without additional preparative steps such as adding dry, salt suspended, or glycerol stabilized enzymes. A further characteristic of a working reagent is that the ingredients of the reagent are in aqueous solution, as contrasted to being in suspension or glycol water solution. In addition, working reagents should be of such volume as to be conveniently and accurately added to the enzyme assay mixture in the course of performing an assay. In particular, very small volume additions are cumbersome, time consuming, and not as likely to be accurate as are larger volumes, either in manual or automated assay methods.To minimize volume measurement error, it is desirable that each reagent addition be as large a proportion of the final volume as possible. That is, if two reagents are used, it is generally desirable that each be about one half of the total final volume.In addition to working reagents being desirable from the standpoint of efficiency due to elimination of added steps and minimization of volume error, working reagents are conducive to repeatability of ingredients from one assay to anotherr which repeatability may be vital to accurate assay from one patient to another.The enhanced reproducibility of working reagents is due to the fact that ingredients are in solution in working reagents, rather than being dry or in suspension. Solutions by definition are uniform in concentration from one portion of the liquid to another.By contrast, suspensions are not homogenous and consequently, particularly if a small sample is used in each test, the sample may differ in the amount of suspended ingredient. An extreme example of this phenomonon is represented by taking samples of water containing suspended sand. Each sample of exactly equal volume does not necessarily contain exactly the same number of grains of sand. The raw material enzymes used by the prior art to prepare working reagents have been stabilized by drying, in glycerol solutions, and by suspension in concentrated 3 6 equivalents per liter of ammonium or sodium as sulfate salts. Although useful in stabilizing raw materials, these means are not usable in stabilizing working reagents, and the working reagents produced such raw materials by the prior art are unstable. Dry enzymes are not easily dispensable and must got into solution prior to use, and cannot easily be used as working reagents.Enzymes in glycerol are difficult to use as a working reagent because glycerol is very viscous and dispensing, mixing, and bubble inclusion are problems in spectrophotometric observations. Enzyme suspensions cannot be used as working reagents because the enzymes contained are not in solution, and accurate sampling is a problem. Further, the high concentrations of ammonium or sodium sulfate would likely adversely affect the properties ofthe enzyme assay for which the working reagent is intended.IV.D. Enzyme Instability Summary Thus, instability seems to be natural and a fundamental property af enzymes. Although the instability property seems desirable in vivo in nature, the inherent instability of enzymes is indicated above as being generally undesirable in an in vitro use of enzymes in assay methods.IV.E. Enzyme Instability Generally Accepted by Prior Art as to Working Reagent Solutions Indeed, it seems even that the well known natural and inherent instability of enzymes in aqueous solutions has been taken for granted by the prior art when employing enzymes as reagents. And refrigeration which slows most chemical and biological processes has been used to slow the process of decay somewhat, although to only a few hours.The prior art acceptance or perhaps its widespread recognition, acquiescence, and even resignation of or to the fact of the unstable nature of enzymes has apparently led to a corresponding and apparently full scale acceptance by the prior art of the use of working enzyme reagents with only a few hours stability.IV.F. Mitchell is Significant Exception to Prior Art s Acceptance of Instability, Even Though Quite Dif ferent from the Present Invention A significant prior art exception has been the attempt ofMitchell U.S. Patent No. 3,962,037 to enhance the stability of enzyme containing reagents for the measurement of glycerol. Mitchell used dextran and Cleland s reagent to achieve satisfactory storage periods of a few days in the glycerol measuring system, relative to the goals of that invention, when the reagent is refrigerated.The means taught by Mitchell differs from the present invention, in addition to other ways, in that it accomplishes only a few day s stability and it further appears limited to use in a particular assay system i.e., glycerol . Also, in the Mitchell patent, the use of a strong reducing agent Cleland s reagent apparently eliminates application where NADH is not measured by U.V. absorption but is coupled to a redox dye such as INT, 2 p Iodophenyl 3 p nitrophenyl 5 phenyl Tetrazolium or redox indicating copper or iron legends. In contrast, the present invention does permit that special type of NADH quantitation, if desired.Additionally, Cleland s reagent per se is a probable contributor to instability of some enzymes.V. The Present Invention Concepts as to the Stabilization of NADH and NADPH and Further Contrasts to Prior Art V.A. Inventive Concepts as to Inclusion of Base, Amount and pH as Factors The present invention, with respect to the advantageous stabilization of working reagent solutions of NADH andNADPH, involves the addition of bases to aqueous solutions of NADH or NADPH, according to two significant discoveries as to the addition of the bases. That is, the amount of base required is discovered to be critical in amount.Further, the pH of the NADH or NADPH solution is discovered to be also critical.V.B. Stability Achievement for NADH and NADPH in Working Solutions These two concepts, and particularly in combination that is the critical concentration of base and the critical pH of the NADH or NADPH solutions accomplish the heretofore unachieved but highly advantageous goal of providing stability of the NADH or NADPH solution for one month.That is, the lack of stability of NADH or NADPH by virtue of loss of ability to absorb ultraviolet light measured as loss of absorbance at 340 nm , and also their lack of stability by virtue of inhibitor formation, are successfully eliminated by the present invention.As used herein, a reference to a NADH or NADPH solution refers to a solution of NADH or NADPH, respectively, in water, which may be prepared by dissolving either NADH orNADPH, as the case may be, in water, or making a NADH orNADPH salt solution in water. It seems that the commercial supply of NADH or NADPH is usually in one or more salts thereof. V.C. Fortuitous Use of NADH and NADPH in Prior Art Buffers It is acknowledged that NADH and NADPH were included, although fortuitously, by the prior art in the buffer required to regulate the pH of the enzyme which was to be assayed. Thus to the extent that the prior art fortuitously employed amine bases at alkaline pH s, in the preparation of buffers, and included NADH or NAbPH in these buffers, the prior art had included NADH or NADPH with alkaline amine.And since it was recognized by the prior art that such inclusion of the NADH or NADPH in the buffer resulted in some degree of stability enhancement although not the kind of enhancement of stability achieved by the present invention , one might assume that the prior art would assume that more of the buffer or perhaps by even a further extension of such logic that more of one of the ingredients of the buffer , would stabilize even more.V.D. Details Showing that the Present Concepts Distinguish from the Prior Art s Fortuitous Use in Buffers However, quite to the contrary, it was discovered as a part of the concepts of the present invention that only critically small amounts of base are optimal to achieve the stability and operability goals of this invention, quite in contrast to the prior art.In further consindering the present inventive concepts, and by way of further contrasting the present discovery with the prior art, it may be helpful to note that the present invention distinguishes from the prior art in both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the prior art s adventitious inclusion of NADH or NADPH in buffer systems.As to the qualitative aspects of such prior art s inclusion, these were seemingly unrecognized by the prior art and as to the quttitative aspect, this was undiscovered by the prior art, and the inter relationships between the quantitative and qualitative aspects were also undiscovered by the prior art. And compounds were included by the prior art, as a part of such buffers, which were not only of no benefit as to stability but probably even detracted from the stability of the resulting NADH NADPH solutions of the prior art.V.E. The Nature of Buffers Helps Discredit the Fortuitous Prior Art as to Inclusions of NADH or NADPH in Buffer The significance of this undesirable inclusion qualitatively by the prior art, particularly its inclusion of other substances other than amine base as a part of the prior art s inclusion of NADH or NADPH in a buffer solution, may be perhaps most easily seen by considering briefly just what is a buffer. This also may help in realizing the significance of the present invention s non inclusion of substances other than base.A buffer is a solution of a weak acid and its conjugate base, or a weak base and its conjugate acid. Amine bases are weak bases, and buffers are made from them by adding an acid such as hydrochloric acid so that a substantial amount of the amine base forms a new compound, the corresponding conjugate acid of that amine base. The resulting solution contains substantial amounts of both amine base and the conjugate acid of the amine base.The amount of conjugate acid of the amine base relative to the amount of amine base per se may be approximated by a mathematical expression related to the Henderson Hasselbalch equation EMI16.1 where Kw is the dissociation constant of water PKb is the dissociation constant of the amine base LB is the concentration of amine base is is the concentration of the conjugate acid of the amine baseTRIS is an amine base wideLy used to prepare buffers. Buffers used in enzyme assays are commonly employed at pH 7.4 at a concentration of at least 0.1 M. The PKb of TRIS is 5.76.In a prior art use of NADH in such a buffer, the relative concentration of conjugate acid of the TRIS to the base form of the TRIS may be calculated by the above equation as follows 7.4 14 5.76 log S HB log rBa 0.84 EBJ 0.144 EHBJ or 6.9 IJThus, in such a buffer, the concentration of the newly formed of the TRIS relative to the concentration of theTRIS base is about 7 times as great. Thus the buffer contains about o.087 moles per liter of newly formed conjugate acid of the TRIS and 0.013 moles per liter of the TRIS base.Since a strong acid was used by the prior art to adjust the pH of the TRIS, the concentration of anion of the strong acid usually chloride would be about 0.087 M, since the hydrogen ion of the conjugate acid of the TRIS comes from the strong acid. V.F. Specific Disadvantages of Prior Art s Fortuitous Use of NADH or NADPH in Buffer The prior art inclusion of NADH in a buffer solution thus included large amounts of conjugate acid of the amine base usually TRIS from which the buffer was prepared as well as large amounts of anion usually sulfate or chloride of the acid used to adjust the pH of the buffer. Also, high concentrations of the amine base were present.According to the optimal application of the present inventive concepts, only the NADH or NADPH and base are present, and only a trace of conjugate acid of the base is present as a consequence of acid contributed by theNADH or NADPH itself. Also no other anions need be present, and desirably are even absent, in contrast to those anions inherently present in the buffer solution of the prior art.Further, in addition to the prior art s using too much of an amine base in a buffer system, the prior art used the amine base in a buffer system at an undesirable pH for stability enhancement that is, the prior art used the amine base in a buffer system at the pH at which the enzyme assay was performed, which pH levels were generally not optimum according to the present invention for stabilizing the NADH or NADPH. Although it apparently was pragmatic and apparently obvious for the prior art to use the buffer at the pH of the assay even though now discovered to be not desirable from a stability standpoint , the present inventive concepts significantly depart from the prior art in departing from the pH of the assay as being a criterion for the pH of the working reagent solution of NADH or NADPH stabilized by the concepts of the present invention.Indeed, should one attempt to apply the concentrations of amine base buffer used by the prior art, to one of the inventive concepts of the present invention, i.e., the departure from using the pH of the assay as a criterion not only would the NADH or NADPH solution have less stability than according to the optimal practice of the present invention, but the high concentration of buffer at pH employed in the present invention would likely adversely affect the pH at which the enzyme assay is conducted when the NADH or NADPH working solution is mixed with other working reagents.V.G. Inventive Concepts as to Stabilization of NADH or NADPH Summarized Thus the combination of critically small amounts of base and optimal pH of the NADH or NADPH working reagents not only accomplishes stability of that working reagent, but also allows the combination of that reagent with other working reagents of that assay in a workable fashion.V.H. Concepts as to Bases Used in Stabilization of NADH and or NADPH Further, with reference to such bases, the present invention uses amine bases including triethanolamine, diethanolamine DEA , ethanolamine, tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane, imidazole, 2 amino 2 methyl 1 propanol, 2 amino 2 methyl 1,3 propanediol, and strong bases including ammonium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and calcium hydroxide. The present invention also uses basic solutions of salts that are formed from the combination of a strong base and weak acid such as rubidium carbonate, sodium borate, sodium carbonate, calcium carbonate, and ammonium carbonate.Although effective in stabilization, calcium and magnesium bases and salts are less desirable because of their limited solubility at the pH discovered to be optimal according to the concepts of the present invention.V.I. Relative Ranking of Bases It was discovered as a part of the present invention that cartain bases are generally more effective than others.From most effective to least effective, they are ammonium hydroxide, triethanolamine, tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane, magnesium hydroxide, calcium carbonate, ammonium carbonate, sodium borate, sodium carbonate, rubidium carbonate, lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, imidazole, diethanolamine, 2 amino 2 methyl 1 propanol, 2 amino 2 methyl 1,3 propanediol, and ethanolamine.V.J. Optimal Stabilization According to the present invention, it was discovered that it is only when such critically small amounts of bases are combined with NADH or NADPH within a limited pH range, desirably in the absence of significant amounts of the conjugate acid of the amine base or other ions included incidental to the preparation of the conjugate acid of the amine base, that optimal stabilization is achieved.In particular, the present invention uses the minimum amount of base required to adjust the pH of a NADH or aNADPH solution to a pH of at least about pH 7.9.V.K. Considerations in Selection of pH Practical considerations will easily lead the practitioner of the present invention to choose the most suitable pH above the minimum pH of about 7.9 in a particular application of the invention to a working NADH or NADPH solution. As an example, the use of a pH of 10 in conjunction with the other inventive concepts of the present invention may produce a working reagent which requires very strong buffering in other working reagents with which it is to be combined, and thus may be less desirable even though it is effective in stabilizing the NADH working reagents solution.The pH values of 8.3 8.5 have been found to be practical and widely applicable in a number of specific embodiments of the present invention, where the stable NADH or NADPH working reagent is used with a wide variety of working enzyme reagents.VI. The Present Inventive Concepts As to the Stabilization of Enzymes in Working Reagents and Further Contrasts to the Prior Art VI.A. The Invention as to Salt Stabilization of Enzymes The present invention employs the proper concentrations of a variety of organic and inorganic salts to stabilize important enzymes useful in the measurement of medically important enzymes and other substances in the blood and other body fluids.Further, with reference to such salts, the present invention uses sodium, potassium, rubidium, ammonium, lithium, or basic amine cations, in combination with organic monophosphate esters including glycerol monosphate, ethylene glycol monosphate, and creatine phosphate , sulfate, certain sulfonated organic acts, carbonate, phosphate, borate, certain dicarboxylic acids, certain dicarboxylic amino acids, or certain monocarboxylic acids, as anions.The concentration of the salt used is generally optimal at a cation concentration of about one equivalent per liter.It was discovered as a part of the present invention that certain cations, among the several workable cations, are more generally effective than others. From most effective to least effective, they are rubidium, potassium, sodium, ammonium, amine bases, i.e., TRIS and TEA and imidazole , and lithium ions. Among the anions, sulfate, phosphate esters including alpha or beta glycerophosphate, ethylene glycol monosphate, dicarboxylic acids i.e., malate and succinate , sulfonated organic acids such as PIPES and phospate are best at stabilizing, followed by carbonate and borate, and dicarboxylic amino acids including alanine and aspartic acid, while monocarboxylic acids i.e., acetate are least effective.The differences between all of the anions above are not as great as the differences in effectiveness of cations, except that monocarboxylic acids are far less effective than the other anions.Halogen anions such as chloride and bromide are not workable in the present invention. The diphosphates of ethylene glycol and glycerol are not effective.In general, the invention is widely applicable to the stabilization of enzymes. The particular cation and anion used and the concentration of the salt formed from particular cation and anion from those found to be effective within this invention, are determined by practical considerations, such as how they affect the rate of the enzyme stabilized or the enzyme being measured. As an example of choosing salt concentration, hex5khase and glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase G 6 PDH are stabilized by 0.45 M potassium sulfate however, the rate of reaction with ATP of these two enzymes is markedly diminished. Thus when using these enzymes to measure ATP in a working reagent, or ATP produced by another enzyme in a working reagent such as in CPK assay the concentration of the salt must be diminished as a compromise between the stability of the working reagent and the rate of ATP measurement. It will be understood, in practicing the invention to stabilize a particular enzyme system, that one should choose a combination of anions and cations taught herein to be workable as a part of this invention which provides the best results in providing a stable useful enzyme reagent.In certain applications of the present invention, where an anion taught to be workable according to the present invention is a substrate in the enzyme assay for which the working enzyme solution is to be stabilized i.e. aspartate or alanine in the SGOT or SGPT enzyme assay the proper cation is chosen from those taught to be useful according to the present invention to compliment the carboxylic amino acid anion of the substrate.Also, combinations of workable anions and cations may be used. A carboxylic acid and sulfate may be used as the anion, and potassium and TRIS may be used as the cation, yielding a mixture of salts known to be useful as a part of the inventive concepts of this invention.Although carboxylic acids are generally useful, in employing the invention with respect to particular enzyme working reagent systems, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that a carboxylic acid must have certain properties, such as that it is soluble, does not react with other substrates or ingredients, does not complex metals required for the activity of the enzyme assayed or of the enzyme used as a reagent in an assay in which such complexing would adversely affect the reaction, does not have oxidation or reduction properties incompatible with the reagent system or the enzyme assay, does not have absorbence in the spectral range used in the assay, and does not react with the product of the assay, and is not an inhibitor of enzymes used in the assay or of an enzyme being assayed.The same consideration as described for the carboxylic acids apply when choosing a particular amini base or sulfonated organic acid when practicing the invention.Further, one should not choose a combination of anions and cations which includes one of the products of the enzyme reaction s .Thus, malic acid would not be chosen to stabilize the enzyme in a working reagent for SGOT using malic dehydrogenase. Ammonia is not useful in stabilizing reagents for urea assay using urease and glutamate dehydrogenase because it is an intermediate in the assay. Obviously, ammonia is not included to stabilize glutamate dehydrogenase used to measure ammonia.VI.B. Contrasts to Prior Art Working Reagent Stabilization Rather Than Merely of Stock or Preparatory state Reagent Supply The novel concepts of the present invention achieve the heretofore unachieved goal of stabilizing a variety of enzymes in working reagent solutions.This contrasts with the prior art which has not achieved prolonged stability in working reagent solutions but only achieved prolonged stability in stock reagents which were then used to prepare working reagents solutions.The prior art suse of salt is a further contrast to the present invention. Not only did the prior art achieve only stabilization of stock reagents with salts as opposed to the present invention s advantageous stabilization of working reagents, but also there are significant qualitative and quantitative differences in such prior art s use of salts. VI. C. Contrasts to Prior Art, Qualitative The prior arts stabilization of stock solutions used sodium and ammonium sulfate to suspend enzymes which were not generally in solution. By contrast, the present invention teaches the use of a variety of both anions and cations, not merely sodium, and ammonium sulfate, to be useful in the stabilization of enzymes in solution in working reagent. The present invention teaches that in many instances there are better and or more useful combinations of these anions and cations than ammonium or sodium sulfate.The present invention teaches a general hierarchy among such useful anions and cations which may be combined in various combinations and mixtures. In particular, certain of the cations may be more advantageous in certain applications than sodium or ammonium ions.VI.D. Contrasts to Prior Art, Quantitative Further, the present invention with respect to the stabilization of enzymes in working reagent solutions contrasts quantitatively from the prior art s use of salts to stabilize enzymes in stock suspensions in that the prior art used two to six equivalents per liter of sodium or ammonium cation with a corresponding amount of sulfate anion to stabilize such suspensions. The present invention utilizes cation concentrations of only about one equivalent per liter with corresponding anion concentrations. In several specific embodiments, cation and anion concentrations are far less than one equivalent per liter.VI.E. Contrasts to Prior Art, Combination with NADH Stabi lization Further contrasting the present invention from the prior art, the present invention has been shown to be useful in combination with novel means of stabilizing NADH or NADPH in enzymatic assays. VI.F. Enzyme Stabilization Without Altering Physical PropertiesAlso, the present invention accomplishes the goal of stabilizing working enzyme reagents without the necessity of significantly altering the physical properties of the working enzyme reagents. That is, the working reagents prepared according to the concepts of the present invention contain no ingredients in suspension as opposed to being in solution, need not show significantly altered viscosity, and may be prepared so as to show insignificant differences from water in refractive index. Such unaltered physical properties have significant advantages when such reagents are used in enzyme assays, particularly when used in automated assays. VI. G. Stability Testing Procedures Stability testing of the concepts and embodiments set forth herein, relating to stability of working reagent solutions of the NADH or NADPH and also of the various enzymes, were made both by the actual storage of working reagent solutions thereof for at least one month under refrigeration at 40C, and or by the accelerated method reported by Lordi and Scott J. of Pharm. Sci., Vol. 54, No. 4, p. 531 537 . Certain of the solutions were stability tested by both methods, for purposes of control and cross checking, and the accelerated method of Lordi and Scott was shown to be sufficiently reliable, within experimental limits and the stability was found in all cases, which were tested by only the accelerated method, to be sufficiently prolonged that any differences, between the results given by the accelerated method and by the actual calendar stability term, would be of negligable import in consideration of the one month stability achievement.
