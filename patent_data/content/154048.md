# CIRCUIT FOR GENERATING TEST SIGNALS FOR IN CIRCUIT DIGITAL TESTING

## Abstract
A circuit for use with a central processor for the in circuit testing of the electrical properties of components intercon nected at elecrical nodes in a circuit under test is disclosed. The nodal test signals have first, second, and disconnect logic states. A test vector processor responds to the central processor to control the generation of the nodal test signals during a test cycle. A plurality of digital test signal means responsive to the vector processor are also provided. Each test means includes a circuit means for storing test signal generating data, and responsive to the stored data, controls the generation of the logic state of a nodal test signal where the logic state of the test signal is controlled to 1 keep the same logic state as the previous logic state, 2 toggle to the opposite state as the previous logic state, or 3 assume either a logic zero or a logic one state regardless of the previous logic state.
