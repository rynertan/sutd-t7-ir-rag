# REACTION PRODUCTS OF AMIDO AMINE AND EPOXIDE USEFUL AS FUEL ADDITIVES

## Abstract
Carboxylic acid derived from fatty acid or aralkyl acid is reacted with multiamine, to form a mixture containing amides, imides, and half esters with subsequent reaction with epoxide, particularly an alkylene oxide to produce a product mix that has good detergent properties in fuels.
