# A MULTI CELL ELECTROLYZER

## Abstract
A multi cell electrolyzer comprising a plurality of unit cells, each of which is composed of an anode chamber containing an anode and a cathode chamber containing a cathode and a cation exchange membrane for partitioning said unit cell into said anode chamber and said cathode chamber and each of which is adapted to have an internal pressure maintained at a level higher than the atmospheric pressure in operation of the electrolyzer, said plurality of unit cells being arranged in series and adapted to be energized through a plurality of current lead plates, and rigid multi contact electrically conductive means provided between the adjacent unit cells and or between each current lead plate and the unit cell adjacent thereto, thereby establishing electrical connection between the adjacent unit cells and or between each current lead plate and the unit cell adjacent thereto. With such a structure, not only the electrical contact resistance between the adjacent unit cells and between each current lead plate and the unit cell adjacent thereto is extremely reduced, but also the current density in the unit cells is rendered uniform. Further, the present multi cell electrolyzer can be easily constructed either in a bipolar form or in a monopoler form using unit cells common to both of the bipolar and monopolar forms.
