# Buried gate structure type semiconductor switching device.

## Abstract
In manufacturing a GTO, a silicon wafer is cut away along one of the crystal planes indicated by n11 in Miller indices, and the burried gate or the current channels are so arranged on the crystal plane that at least one longitudinal direction thereof is substantially in parallel with at least one of axes indicated by 2nn on condition that the inner product of the plane vector and the axis vector is zero. In the GTO thus manufactured, it is possible to minimize the crystal defect density on the crystal plane and thus to realize the GTOs having uniform turned on voltage, in particular, while increasing the controllable current markedly.
