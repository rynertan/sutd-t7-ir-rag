# TW Electroerosion apparatus with wheeled drive carriages.

## Abstract
A traveling electrode electroerosion apparatus using a pair of wheeled carriages 3, 4 which accommodate axial elec trode drives and machining feed drives. The wheeled carriages also carry a pair of guide members 9, 10 for establishing a straight line path for the electrode 1 to travel through the workpiece 2 . The axial drives used to maintain the electrode in traveling alignment with the straight line path serve in this improvement to generate a tension force acting on the travel ing electrode to force one of the wheeled carriages against one of two parallel surfaces and the other of the wheeled car riages to the other of the surfaces, thereby intensifying their respective frictional engagement with these surfaces, e.g. the upper and lower surfaces of the workpiece which may be mas sive. The machining feed drives are accommodated in the wheeled carriages and may be driven to enable these car riages in intensified frictional engagement with the surfaces to accurately and stably roll over them, so as to allow the straight line path to move, leaving a programmed movement trajectory, relative to the workpiece to advance electroerosion along the trajectory in the workpiece.
