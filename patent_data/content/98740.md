# SEAT MOUNTING

## Abstract
This invention is a mounting enabling the height and atti tude of a motor car seat to be adjusted to suite the user s re quirements. A single drive 1 is provided for bell cranks 4, 12 respectively at the front and the rear of the seat, but there is a lost motion connection 9 between the drive 1 and the rear bell crank 12 so that in raising the seat the front will be raised first, until the lost motion has been taken up, and then the front and the rear will be raised together until the rear of the seat is at the desired height, and the the drive can be reversed to bring the front of the seat to the desired height provided it is within the amount of lost motion provided without disturb ing the height of the rear of the seat. The equipment can be easily modified for independent adjustment of the front and the rear of the seat by disabling the lost motion drive and including a second drive 53 for the rear bell crank 12 . The lost motion device between front and rear drive shafts 2 and 10 includes a pawl 18 rotatably mounted on each shaft, and stops 36, 34 through which the pawls can drive after a certain amount of rotation.
