# Surface treatment of metals.

## Abstract
A process for hardening the surface of a metal body in which the surface is first bombarded with ions capable of oc cupying interstitial sites in its crystal lattice, the a coating of a reactive metal is deposited on the surface, and finally the coat ing is bombarded with ions which will react with it to form a hard material such as a carbide or nitride. The bombardment is continued until the hard material has become embodied in the surface by means of radiation enhanced diffusion.
