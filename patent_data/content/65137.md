## Description
Background of the Invention The human tooth decay is a so called multi factorial disease which is caused by many factors which are connected with one another in a complicated manner. One of the main factors is that dental plaque is formed from saliva and sucrose taken by streptococci always present in the mouth and tooth decay is readily caused by this dental plaque. As the streptococci synthesizing this dental plaque, there are knownStreptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus salivarius. Among these streptococci, it is Streptococcus mutans that synthesizes water insoluble polysaccharides and forms dental plaque inducing the dental caries. Accordingly, in order to prevent. the dental caries, it is important to know the environmental condition in the mouth, especially the amount of Strepyococcus mutans present in the mouth.For this purpose, there was previously developed and proposed a method of measuring the dental caries activity see Japanese PatentApplication Laid Open Specification No. 55260 1980 . The MSB broth that is used in this conventional method, however, has several defects as described below. More specifically, it has been found that the composition of the MSB broth is changed with the lapse of time after preparation of the MSB broth and propagation of Streptococcus mutans hereinafter referred to as dental caries pathogen and inhibition of growth of other bacteria become uncertain. It has been considered that this defect is based on the essence of the composition of theMSB broth and is therefore unavoidable.The reason is that it is impossible to store an antibiotic substance such asBacitracin at normal temperatures in the culture medium for a long time without reduction of the antibiotic activity thereof. Accordingly, a fresh MSB broth is prepared when the test is carried out. Therefore, in the clinical examination, it is practically impossible for a dental practitioner to apply the above mentioned method using this MSB broth to diagnosis. Description of the Invention The present invention relates to a culture medium for testing the dental caries activity, in which two or three of ingredients of a liquid medium capable of selectively propagating bacteria which causes dental caries, Streptococcus mutans, are contained. These ingredients are not added to said culture medium in the initial stage but are present outside in the dry state and just before use of said culture medium, said ingredients are included in said culture medium to obtain a desirable composition of the culture medium. We made researches with a view to provide an improved simple MSB broth having the same capacity as that of the original MSB broth, which would be conveniently used by a practising dentist in an ordinary clinical examination and would be manufactured at a low cost. The compositions of the MSB medium and the culture medium of the present invention are shown in Table 1.

A liquid basal medium having the composition from whichBacitracin hereinafter referred to as BA , potassium tellurite hereinafter referred to as TE , and Trypan Blue hereinafter referred to as TB and or Crystal Violet, have been removed is prepared, and this liquid basal medium is sterilized and is stored aseptically. Separately, BA, TE and TB are made independently present as additive reagents in the dry state on an appropriate support, and the additive reagent containing support is sterilized and is stored aseptically. When the test is actually carried out, a dentist dissolves the additive reagents in the liquid basal medium sterilely to form an instant MSB broth simply. In this case,TB, a coloring material which is contained in the support is dissolved in the liquid basal medium to color the medium.By this coloration, completion of dissolution of other ingredients can be confirmed. From the results of the experiments made by us, it was found that the above mentioned combination of culture medium composition is comparable to the conventionalMSB broth as a clinical medium for selectively culturing the dental caries pathogen in saliva see Table 2 and that even if the combination of culture medium composition is subjected to 6 months shelf life test, the capacity is not degraded see Table 3 . We have now completed the present invention based on the foregoing findings.

Sample fresh saliva Saliva of a 23 years old healthy man in whom high dental caries activity was found by a preliminary test. Operation 0.1 ml of the sample was added to the culture medium control culture medium or culture medium subjected to the shelf life test , and cultured at 37Qfor 24 hours according to rountine procedures. In carrying out the present invention, the vessel in which the liquid basal medium is contained functions also as a culturing device, and therefore, a colorless transparent glass vessel having an inner diameter of about 70 mm, for example, an ampoule, a vial, a tubing bottle or a test tube, can advantageously be used. The additive reagents, that is, BA,TE and TB, are independently freeze dried or spread on a paper such as a filter paper. In each case, solvent is eliminated as much as possible to obtain a product of the present invention. The present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the following Examples. Incidentally, the liquid basal medium shown in Table 1 was commonly used in theseExamples.Example 1 A A colorless transparent glass vial having an inner diameter of 12 mm and a diameter of about 8 mm in the vicinity of the opening was charged with 2 ml of the liquid basal medium and the glass vial was sealed with a rubber stopper. Sterilization was performed at 1150C for 15 minutes. B A circular filter paper having a thickness of 0.8 mm and a diameter of 8 mm was used as the support for the additive reagents. The additive reagents, BA, TE and TB were independently dissolved and included in the support in manners as described below, and the support was dried under reduced pressure and sealed in a vessel.1 BA A solution of 0.4 U of Bacitracin in about 0.002 ml of water was poured onto the support by using a micropipette.2 TE A solution of 0.4 mg of potassium tellurite in about 0.002 ml of water was poured onto a different support by using a micropipette.3 TB A solution of 0.15 mg of Trypan Blue in about 0.002 ml of water was poured onto a different support by using a micropipette. then the culture medium composition was actually used, the rubber stopper was taken out from the vessel containing the basal medium, which was obtained in A above, and the reagent containing supports obtained in 3 1 , B 2 and B 3 above were thrown into the basal medium described in A above.After 30 seconds, the supports were taken out and 0.1 ml of saliva of the patient was added to the culture medium. Then, the vessel was sealed again with the rubber stopper and cultivation was carried out at 370C for 24 hours.Example 2 A A 3 ml capacity ampoule having an inner diameter of about 9.5 mm and an opening diameter of about 4 mm the diameter of the broken face on the tubular body top when the ampoule was broken was charged with 2 ml of the liquid basal medium, and the top end of the ampoule was melt sealed and sterilization was carried out at 1150C for 15 minutes. B A square filter paper having a thickness of 0.5 mm and one side of 3.5 mm was used as the support. Solutions of the additive reagents BA, TE and TB were independently poured onto supports in the same manner as described in B of Example 1 to obtain a product. When the culture medium composition was actually used, the ampoule A was broken, and the reagent containing paper supports B l , B 2 and B 3 were added to the basal medium A in the same manner as described in Example 1. Then, 0.1 ml of saliva of the patient was added to the medium and the opening was covered with a sterilized aluminum cap. Cultivation was carried out at 370C for 24 hours.Example 3 A A basal medium was prepared in the same manner as in A of Example t except that Crystal Violet was not added. Then, 2 ml of the basal medium was charged in a small glass tube having an inner diameter of about 10 mm and a length of 60 mm, and the opening was covered with a closely fitting polypropylene stopper. Sterilization was carried out at 1150C for 15 minutes. Bì Additive reagent containing three square filter paper supports having a thickness of 0.5 mm and one side of 3.5 mm were prepared in the same manner as described in Example 2, and they were bonded in a line to a transparent plastic sheet having a width of 3.5 mm, a length of 50 mm and a thickness of 0.3 mm by using an appropriate adhesive. In this case, the three supports were not separated from one another but combined together, and therefore, they could be handled very easily. The BA and TE supports were prepared in the same manner as described in Example 2, but the TB support was prepared in a manner as described in 3 below.3 TB A mixed coloring material solution of 0.15 mg of TrypanBlue and 0.0016 mg of Crystal Violet in about 0.002 ml of water was poured onto the support filter paper by using a micropipette.
