# Organometallic chemical vapour deposition of films.

## Abstract
There is provided a method of producing inorganic thin films by metal inorganic chemical vapour deposition. The method comprises forming a vapour stream 10 comprising a vapour mixture of an organometallic compound and a heterocyclic organic compound incorporating a group V or group VI element, and thermally decomposing the mixture on a heated substrate 13 to form an inorganic layer. The heterocyclic compound mav be an aliphatic or aromatic ring compound. The mixture may include vapours appropriate for deposition of ternary or higher order compounds, and or for introducing dopants.
