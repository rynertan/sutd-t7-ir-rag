# LOW PERMEABILITY SPIRAL FABRIC AND METHOD

## Abstract
A fluid permeable fabric is disclosed having particular ad vantages as a dryer fabric for papermaking is disclosed. The fabric includes a number of helix A extending cross wise in the fabric and joined together along the length dimension by pin tles 38. Crevice spaces 40 formed by intermeshing bend por tions extending into the loop openings C are closed by a con toured filler strip B. The contoured filler strip occupies the loop openings and includes contoured edges 56 which penetrate and occupy a substantial portion of the crevice spaces. A fab ric having a low permeability is thus provided. An enlarged heat radiating surface 52 facing the paper side 39 of the fabric in creases the heat transfer occurring in the paper web W to ex pedite drying. Crevice space 40 and tapered edges 56 of the fil ler element provide a guiding function which facilitates filler in sertion in the loop openings.
