# Method and apparatus for neutron activation analysis.

## Abstract
Neutron activation is used to analyse the silicon and aluminium content of samples 13 of material, such as baux ite ore and coal. The analysis can be performed on bulk sam ples, on material on a moving conveyor belt 12 , or on the walls of a borehole. The method involves high energy neutron irradiation by neutron source 10 of the sample 13 , meas urement of the thermal neutron flux by neutron detector 11 in the sample 13 , and monitoring the gamma radiation by gamma detector 14 from the sample at energies of a 1.78 MeV and b 0.844 MeV and or 1.015 MeV. Such gamma radiation is produced on decay of a ²⁸Al and b ²⁷Mg isotopes, produced by the reactions ²⁸Si n,p ²⁸Al and ²⁷Al n,p ²⁷Mg. A single gamma ray detector 14 is used. The analysis preferably utilises equations which include terms to compensate for a the production of radiation at 1.78 MeV as a result of the production of the isotope ²⁸Al from ²⁷Al by the thermal neutron reaction ²⁷Al n γ ²⁸Al, and b the Compton scattering of the 1.78 MeV gamma radiation and background.
