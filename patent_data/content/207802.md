## Description
This invention relates to electrical receptacles, such as for use in wall outlet boxes, with ground fault protection. It is known, from the description of U.S. Patent No. 4,010,431, relating to a ground fault receptacle from which the present invention improves. The purposes is to achieve greater package density in a ground fault receptacle so as to reduce assembly time and cost. More dense packaging is sought so a fully assembled unit can be installed more easily and quickly in an ordinary outlet box but at the same time the cost needs to be minimized and the reliability maximized. An object is to provide an arrangement including load terminals of one piece construction for each polarity of line that have a protruding spring finger so that a varistor for protection of the electronics can be inserted easily between the load terminal fingers and pressure contact made therewith. The housing base and front cover cooperate to maintain the varistor in position. In this manner the need for soldering the varistor into the circuit of the receptacle, as has been required heretofore, is avoided. According to the present invention, a ground fault receptacle comprises an insulative housing including a base and a cover, said cover having plug blade receiving apertures therein, said housing containing internal contacts for engaging with the blades of a plug inserted in said cover apertures and also containing components of a ground fault interrupter, said ground fault interrupter comprising a sensor transformer core and a grounded neutral transformer core each of which has a pair of conductors extending through a central aperture therein, said pair of conductors being connected with wiring terminals accessible on the exterior of said housing, said ground fault inter rupter also comprising a sensing amplifier and trip circuit connected with a sensing winding on said sensor transformer core and a varistor conductively engaged between two of said internal contacts, said varistor being in the form of a disk with opposing major surfaces respectively engaging individual ones of spring fingers of said internal con tacts, said varistor disk also having an edge surface extending between said major surfaces, said cover having an inner surface with a protrusion extending therefrom that, when said cover is assembled with said base, bears against said varistor disk edge surface and maintains said varistor disk securely in place in said housing between said spring fingers. Conveniently, a carrier is provided that permits a sensing transformer, grounded neutral transformer, a hybrid electronic circuit, and a trip solenoid to be preassembled as a unit and simply inserted into the recep tacle housing with minimal additional electrical connec tions. The carrier, which may be of molded plastic material, has a sensor carrier element and a solenoid carrier element that snap together and are interlocked in such a way as to present aligned ports for the leads of the hybrid circuit without requiring bending, cutting or other modification of their configuration. This achieves, a unitary electronic sensing and operating pre assembly with high density and economy. The invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 shows a ground fault circuit interrupter 10 schematically illustrated connected between an ac supply 12 and a load 14. The system depicted is a single phase, two wire, system in which the distribution conductors are identified as a hot line conductor L and a neutral conduc tor N, the latter being connected to the ground side of the supply 12. Conductors L and N extend to the load 14 through the interrupter unit 10 by connections at input terminals 15 and 16 and output terminals 17 and 18. For use in a ground fault receptacle, the unit 10 is associated with the load 14 through a male plug and female socket connection in the normal manner at the output terminals 17 and 18. The unit 10 has a sensor transformer 20 through which conductors L and N extend as primary windings. Conductors L and N also extend as primary windings through an additional grounded neutral transformer 22 which may, for example, be arranged substantially as disclosed in the specification of U.S. Patent No. 3,959,693. The unit 10 further includes an electronic circuit 24 that may sometimes be referred to herein simply as the hybrid circuit as the usual manner of its construc tion is by hybrid circuit techniques in which components are mounted and interconnected on a substrate, such as of a ceramic material, and enclosed or potted in a resinous insulation material except for terminal leads extending therefrom. Suitable circuitry for the electronic circuit 24 is generally known. An amplifier and trip circuit 24a not fully shown is disclosed in the specification of U.S. Patent No. 3,852,642, may be used in the electronic circuit 24. The circuit 24a has inputs 25 and 26 from a sensing winding 28 of the sensing transformer 20. The circuit 24 also includes a full wave rectifi er bridge 24b connected at two additional terminals 29 and 30 for developing operating power for circuit 24. A trip signal to solenoid coil 36 is derived from lead 29. A further terminal 31 of the circuit 24 is connected to join a grounded neutral resistor 24c within circuit 24 to branch 38 that is connected to one side of winding 39 on grounded neutral transformer 22. The circuit 24 is therefore, in this example, a hybrid circuit with five leads. Each of the conductors L and N has switches 40 and 41 connected respectively in series with them which respectively comprise stationary contacts 40a and 41a and movable contacts 40b and 41b. Circuit branch 33 connects to conductor N through a third switch 42 having a movable contact 42b operated by the plunger of the solenoid 36a associated with the coil 36 to close in contact with conductor N. Dashed line 44 schematically represents the mechanical linkage normally of a plurality of elements between the plunger of the solenoid and the movable con tacts 40b, 41b and 42b. It is also the case that the movable contact 42b of the third switch 42 is a latch member that latches in the closed position the switches 40 and 41 of the L and N conductors as well as the third switch 42. The physical arrangement and manner of opera tion of the switches 40, 41 and 42 may be in accordance with that disclosed in the specification of U.S. Patent No. 4,442,470. A test circuit branch 46 is connected from a point on the load side of conductor L to a point on the supply side of conductor N. Branch 46 includes a resistor 47 and a test switch 48. Manual operation of switch 48 produces a current imbalance in conductors L and N that causes a trip indicating the operability of the unit 10. A varistor 32 for the protection of the unit 10 against damage due to overvoltages, such as transient surges, is connected as shown between the load terminals 17 and 18. One aspect of the present invention is an improve ment in the manner in which varistor 32 is arranged and connected in the unit 10. By this invention, varistor 32 is conductively engaged merely by pressure to spring elements of load terminals 17 and 18. A ground fault receptacle 10 as shown in Figure 1 is desirably made in as compact and inexpensive a manner as possible. Compactness is sought to minimize the bulk that has to be fit into a wall outlet box. Economy in the choice of components is important but an overriding consid eration is to have a unit that permits the numerous ele ments to be assembled quickly and simply so it can be made reliably in large numbers at a high rate with relatively low degree of assembly skill. The present invention addresses these interests and provides a unit designed for both quality and economy. Figure 2 shows an assembled front view which is substantially similar to prior ground fault receptacles. This is a duplex receptacle having within an insulating housing 50 all the components of unit 10 of Figure 1 for interrelation with each of two plugs to be inserted through apertures 51a in front cover 51 of the housing. Housing 50 includes a front cover 51, a back cover 52 Figure 7 , and a base 53 e.g. Figures 3 and 4 , each of molded insulating material. The housing 50 is disposed in association with a metal mounting yoke 54 that in this version is a substan tially planar element of which part is disposed between the base 53 of the housing and its front cover 51 in conven tional manner. Grounding terminals extend inwardly from the yoke 54 into the base 53 and are accessed through the arcuate shaped ones of the openings 51a, as has been done previously. A grounding terminal screw 54a is associated with a side extension of the yoke 54 for connection of an external grounding wire in the usual manner. Centrally located in the front cover 51 are test and reset buttons labeled as is the practice in ground fault receptacles. In the bottom view of Figure 7 is seen the bottom cover 52 of the housing 50. The housing base 53 and its bottom cover 52 have side recesses at which terminal screws 55 are located for connecting wires to internal contacts of the unit. The bottom cover 52 has a recessed fasteners 56 for securing the unit together. A T shaped areas 57 is a minor enlargement of the recess in the back cover for the accommodation of internal components. In the specific embodiment described, the area 57 is one that extends from the main portion of the back cover 52 by only about 0.040 in. It shows an example of how the box like unit of base 53 and covers 50 and 52 can have minor nonuniformities for convenience in holding the containing elements. Figures 3 and 4 shown the base 53 of the unit, unassembled, respectively from the top and in section. Figure 8 shows a view of the base 53, unassembled, from the bottom of Figure 9 being a section of Figure 8. What is generally illustrated is that the base 53 is a molded plastic element that is compartmentalized by numerous partitions separating recesses or openings of which those numbered 53a and 53b, respectively, are examples to accom modate internal components of the unit. When assembled, but without front and back covers in place, the unit 10 appears from the front as shown in Figure 5 and from the back as shown in Figure 10 with Figure 6 being a sectional view of Figure 5 and Figure 11 being a sectional view of Figure 10. Note that the views of Figs. 6 and 11 omit the mounting yoke 54. In these views a physical arrangement of the elements of the circuit schematic of Figure 1 can be seen. Supply terminals 15 and 16 are represented by a pair of screw terminals 55a and 55b as shown in Figure 10. The screw terminals 55a and 55b are each associated with a one piece load contact element 60 and 61 each of which runs down the side of the unit Fig. 11 to another pair of screw terminals 55c and 55d for wiring that proceeds through the distribution system to another receptacle or a switch. Load or output terminals 17 and 18 of Figure 1 are represented by the configuration as shown in Figure 5 in which the upstanding female contact elements 60a and 61a of load contacts 60 and 61 are illustrated. Sensing transformer 20 and grounded neutral transformer 22 are shown in Figure 10 with conductors L and N from the screw terminals 55a and 55b entering within the central apertures of these cores as line and neutral primary conductors. Windings 28 and 39 are on the exterior of transformers 20 and 22, respectively. The electronic circuit 24 is shown in Figure 10 in the form of a hybrid having five leads 25, 26, 29, 30 and 31 for connection with the rest of the unit. The switch structure is essentially as disclosed in the specification of U.S. Patent Nos. 4,010,431 and 4,442,470. The commutator plate 44 of the switch is shown in Figures 6 and 11 along with other elements. Of particular interest in Figure 5 is the dispo sition of a metal oxide varistor element 32 between the upstanding contact fingers 60a and 61a. The varistor 32 is a disk shaped element that is inserted between spring fingers and held by them in electrical contact so as to satisfy the circuit as shown in Figure 1. It is addition ally the case that the top cover 51 of the unit has a protrusion that extends within the base cavity within which the varistor 32 is located and secures it against dislodgement. Figure 5A shows one of the load terminal members 60 for the unit 10. A second load terminal member 61, one being for the hot line conductor L and the other being for the neutral conductor N, is substantially like the first except that it is a mirror image thereof. In most respects the load terminal members 60 and 61 have features in accordance with prior practice and are each of a unitary member of conductive material. Upstand ing female contact elements 60a at each end are physically and electrically joined by a side piece 60b that runs within a slot in base 53 adjacent the base outside wall. What is specifically varied from prior practice is that at one end of the terminal member 60 there is an additional element 60c, unitary with the rest of the member, that is a varistor spring contact element that extends down away from the face of the unit and somewhat laterally toward the other load terminal member. Figure 5B shows a partial end view of terminal member 60 and 61 with the configuration of spring contacts 60c and 61c shown having varistor 32 therebetween. The varistor spring contact elements 60c and 61c of each of the load terminal members 60 and 61 face each other in the assembled unit as shown in Figures 5 and 5B. In prior receptacles it was the practice to have one of the inner housing walls extend between adjoining compartments for line and neutral contacts which is favorable for electrical isolation. The change of the present invention, however, is to have a space between the terminal members accommodating the disk shaped varistor element 32. The varistor 32 is located on edge so the varistor spring contact elements 60c and 61c of each of the terminal members bear against the opposing major surfaces of the varistor 32 making pressure electrical contact therewith without the need for soldering or the like. In Figure 5B is seen that a base housing wall 53a permits contact spring elements 60c to fit over it and bear against the varistor disk 32 that rests on the bottom of one of the housing compartments 53b. The other contact spring element 61c is likewise so disposed. An additional feature is that the front cover 51 has a projection 51b that extends between the terminals 60c and 61c and bears against the edge surface of the varistor disk 32 suffi ciently to hold the varistor in place between 60c and 61c against the bottom 53c of base recess 53b. In this way the cooperation between the housing base 53, front covers 51, terminal members 60 and 61 and varistor 32 achieves secure and electrically effective protection of unit. Other than through the varistor 32, the contacts 60 and 61 are elec trically isolated by portions of the housing structure. The other aspect of the unit that contributes considerably to low cost assembly while maintaining high reliability is a carrier pre assembly. A carrier member 70 for transformers 20 and 22 and the circuit 24 is shown in Figures 12 and 13 and is formed of a unitary piece of molded plastic material. In reference to the assembled back view of Figure 10, Figure 12 is a view of the carrier 70 from the left and Figure 13 is a view in the same orientation as Figure 10. The carrier 70 has the following elements and features A barrel portion 71 of generally cylindrical configuration that is sized, in this example, with areas 71a and 71b of slightly different diameter that respective ly just accommodate the sensor and grounded neutral trans former cores 20 and 22. The center of the barrel portion 71 is hollow with a central longitudinal partition 71c forming two channels for respective bare conductors L and N. The barrel extremity has an offset portion 71d so leads L and N are electrically isolated from each other as shown in Figure 10. A bulkhead portion 72 of carrier 70 encompasses a cross sectional portion of the barrrel 71 and has a larger substantially rectangular portion 72a with notches 72b for joining to it a solenoid bobbin or subcarrier, to be described. A circuit mounting portion 73 of carrier 70 extends above the barrel in the view of Figure 13 and having apertures 73a or eyelets in which leads from the electronic circuit 24 are inserted. Figures 14 and 15 show the assembled carrier 70 with transformers 20 and 22 and circuit 24 as well as solenoid bobbin or subcarrier 74. The solenoid bobbin 74 is of a separate molded plastic piece. It has a pair of end walls 74a between which the beyond one of which is a solenoid barrel portion 74b. The solenoid coil 36 is wound on the barrel 74b and the solenoid trip actuator 44 extends through the barrel. The end walls 74a of the bobbin 74 have clip portions 74c that fit onto the wall 72a of the carrier 70 at the notches 72b. The bobbin 74 has a portion 74c with an eyelet for a conductor. Figure 16 shows the solenoid subcarrier 74 separately. The carrier assembly makes the asembly of the unit 10 much easier because now the transformer cores 20 and 22, solenoid 36 44 and circuit 24 may all be pre assembled independent of the housing 50. After the assembly 70 has been put in place as a unit, the assembler is only required to make the necessary electrical connec tions for the line and neutral conductors while it is in the housing. In assembly the following sequence of operations is suitable. The housing base 53 is arranged for assembly from the front with the base being as shown in Figure 3 shown after assembly in Figure 5 . The test resistor 47 is inserted upright in base opening 47a. The upper lead 47c of resistor 47 is laid in a groove 47d in the base 53. The contact assembly 60, on the side near the test resistor 47 the line side , is then inserted, the commutator elements 44 are then put in place. Leads L and N of the commutator extend through openings in the base as shown in Figure 6. The other neutral side contact assembly 61 is placed. After these operations the test spring 48b Figure 6 is placed over the bottom lead of resistor 47 and both are wedged between contact 60 and the base molding for electrical continuity. The metal oxide varistor disk 32 is slipped between the spring fingers 60c and 61c of the contacts 60 and 61. The reset spring is put in place, extending through the base to the back side. The yoke 54 is located and then the reset button pre assembly is arranged. This concludes the placement of components in the base 53 from the front side. The front cover 51, with its pre assembly cover spring, is then put on the base 53 and fasteners applied. The front cover 51 with its projection 51b to hold the metal oxide varistor 32 is placed over the base front assembly wherein the front cover spring goes over the projection 44a on the commutator 44. After the front assembly, with the front cover in place, is completed, the unit is reversed with the base 53 in the position shown in Figure 8. The carrier 70 with everything mounted on it is fed with leads L and N from the commutator 44 into respective channels of the carrier barrel 71. The plungers are inserted in the solenoid bobbin 74 and placed onto the carrier 70 . Then the assembled carrier 70 is placed in the base by threading eyelet 30 over the reset spring lead. The eyelet on the solenoid bobbin 74c is located over a tab on the load contact on the line side. Then the few required soldering and welding operations are performed to complete the circuitry. The bottom cover 52 and its two screws 56 are placed in proper location and the unit fastened together.
