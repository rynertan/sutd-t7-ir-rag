## Description
VIBRATOR FEED FOR AUGER CONVEYOR. This invention relates to a device for feeding powdered or granular material to an auger conveyor and more particularly concerns a vibratory, adjustable plate adapted to be positioned between the outlet of a hopper and a conveying trough to control the flow of finely divided particles of material. It is difficult to obtain the controlled discharge of powdered or granular material because certain powdered materials have a tendency to cake and flow unevenly while other material that is made up of slightly larger grains will flow readily. Some materials require that the storage hopper be agitated or vibrated to assure flow while other materials will flow readily by gravity toward a discharge opening. The use of devices for vibrating storage hoppers or conveyor troughs to promote material flow is disclosed in the United States Patents to Wahl,No. 2,800,252 and No. 2,957,608 the United States Patent to Klueger, No. 2,631,969 and the United States Patent toDi Nuzzo, No. 2,800,256.The United States Patent toVitkin, No. 2,801,773 discloses a mechanism for jiggling cotter pins in discharge openings of a plate to prevent the clogging of the passages, and the United States Patents to Euston, No. 319,684 and to Williams, No. 3,050,215 disclose mechanism for vibrating a hopper to promote passage of material through openings defined by adjustable gates. The device of the present invention provides for the control of the discharge in an entirely different manner than the above mentioned patents in that the present control device features a plate that is vibrated independently of either the associated storage hopper or of any associated conveyor. A plate is adjustably mounted between the discharge opening of a storage hopper and a conveyor onto which the material is to be discharged and is arranged to be vibrated independently of the conveyor to promote movement of material from the hopper to the conveyor. Reference is now made to the accompanying drawings wherein Figure 1 is a fragmentary diagrammatic side elevation of a device for handling powdered or granular material which incorporates the flow control device of the present invention Figure 2 is an enlarged diagrammatic section taken along line 2 2 of Figure 1. Figure 3 is an enlarged fragmentary diagrammatic plan of the flow control device and the associated conveyor, the view being taken looking substantially in the direction indicated by arrows 3 3 of Figure 2. DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT In Figure 1 the reference numeral 10 indicates generally a material feeding device incorporating the feed control mechanism of the present invention. The device of Figure 1 comprises a hopper 12 having an open lower end Figure 2 disposed above the open upper side of a trough 15 of a conventional screw conveyor that is mounted on fixed supports 13 and has spaced side walls 16 and 17 and an auger 18. A control plate 20 is secured by bolts 14 between flanges 12a on the lower end of the hopper and flanges 16a and 17a on the upper ends of the walls of the trough 15. Gaskets 19 are disposed between each flange 12a and the control plate 20, and gaskets 21 are positioned between the control plate and the flanges 16a and 17a.The gaskets may be made of resilient material, such as rubber, so that the control plate can reciprocate in a generally horizontal plane relative to the trough under the urging of a vibrator 23 bolted to the plate. The vibrator may be of any conventional type, such as those having electrically driven vibrating masses which impart vibratory motion to the member to which they are attached. The plate 20 has a body portion surrounding a rectangular opening 20a which extends transversely above the trough. When the vibrator 23 imparts vibratory movement to the plate, it also vibrates a plate section 20b Figure 2 that is bent downwardly from the plate proper to extend at an angle into the open upper end of the trough. Plate section 20b extends part way across the trough toward the wall 16, and a generally rectangular slotted metering plate 24 is adjustably secured to the upper surface of section 20b near the outer edge of that section by means of a plurality of screws 25 that extend through slots in plate 24 and are threaded into section 20b 6f the control plate 20. Accordingly, the distance between the outer edge of the metering plate 24 and the inner face of the wall 16 of the trough can be varied. To prepare the control plate for operation with any particular material, the plate is adjusted so that the opening between the outer edge of the plate and the wall 16 of the trough will prevent any substantial flow of that material through the opening when the vibrator 23 is inactive. Then, when the vibrator is energized, material will feed downwardly through the opening 20a and across the plate 20 and out the discharge opening between the plate and the wall. In this manner, not only is the rate and quantity of material controlled, but the flow characteristics of the material are improved due to the vibrating action.
