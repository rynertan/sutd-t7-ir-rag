# Atomic resonance line source lamps and spectrophotometers for use with such lamps.

## Abstract
A single atomic element hollow cathode lamp assembly HCL has a lamp formed by a hollow cathode electrode CA and an anode electrode AN within a sealed envelope SE . A base BA is attached to the envelope SE , and located within the base BA is a resistor network RN consisting of four resistor R1, R2, R3 and R4 connected to a common lead EL . Two plug terminals P6 and P7 protruding from the base BA and connected respectively to the electrodes CA and AN provide connecting means for connecting these electrodes to lamp power supply means LPS . Five plug terminals P1 to P5 protruding from the base BA and connected respectively to the resistors R1 to R4 and the common lead EL provide further connecting means for including the resistor network in measurement circuit means MCM in an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The resistor network represents the atomic element of the lamp by virtue of two of the resistors R1 and R2 and furthermore represents a lamp operating current by virtue of the other two resistors R3 and R4 . The terminals P1 to P7 are arranged in a conventional octal plug configuration with a boss BA1 on the base BA for ensuring correct electrical connection.
