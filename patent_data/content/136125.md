# REAGENT CONTAINER

## Abstract
Apparatus and a method for orienting a reagent container 10 in a rack 24 so that the label 38 on the container always points towards the user is provided. The container 10 has an external surface at least a portion of which has an asymmetric perimeter which has mirror symmetry about at most one axis, said perimeter lying in a plane substantially parallel to the base of the container. The rack 24 has an aperture having essentially the same asymmetric perimeter as the container and a size which permits the container to be received in the aperture in only one orientation. In certain preferred embo diments, the asymmetric perimeter is D shaped, the container has a cavity 22 with inwardly sloping sides and the container includes an integral sight glass 32 by which its contents can be viewed.
