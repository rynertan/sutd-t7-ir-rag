# SMALL PEPTIDES WITH THE SPECIFICITY OF FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE VIRAL ANTIGENS

## Abstract
Small peptides that display the specificity of FMD viral antigens. The peptides are useful in compositions and methods for the protection of animals for at least some time from FMD viral infections. The peptides of this invention may be prepared by conventional synthetic methods, recombinant DNA technology or a combination of the two. They may also be modified in composi tion and conformation to improve further their specific antigenic properties.
