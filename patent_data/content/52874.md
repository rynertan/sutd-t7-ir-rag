## Description
METHOD FOR SYNTHESIZING PROCOAGULANT FACTOR VIII ACTIVITY The present invention pertains to a method of generating factor VIII, or anti hemophilic factor ARF activity from inactive protein. Anti hemophilic factor AHF , often referred to as factor VIII, is a protein material present in trace amounts in normal human and animal blood plasma. FactorVIII corrects the coagulation defect of hemophilic plasma and also a functional defect in VonWillebrand s disease plasma. Factor VI II is defined by its activity which is diminished in patients with hemophilia A. AHF is used for the treatment of hemophilia A which is defined to be a deficiency of factor VIII procoagulant activity . One unit of factor VIII activity is defined as the amount in one mililiter of pooled, fresh, normal, citratetreated plasma. The basis for therapy of bleeding episodes in patients afflicted with hemophilia involves transfusion of material containing factor VIII procoagulant activity which temporarily corrects this specific defect. In general, whole blood is not administered to the patient, and its use is limited to restoration of blood volume in instances of severe loss. While plasma with a high factor VIII content may be employed, the preferred method of treatment involves administration of factorVIII concentrates. Factor VIII is obtained from whole blood plasma donated by human volunteers. However, because only a small quantity of factor VIII is present in a given volume of blood, it is important to maximize the recovery of this protein material. The problem is complicated because whole blood is generally collected into anti coagulant materials such as sodium citrate, sodium oxalate, citrate dextrose, citrate phosphate dextrose, or EDTA ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid . The presence of these anticoagulants tends to diminish the factor VIII activity present in the collected plasma. These standard anti coagulant compounds are metal chelating agents and it has been postulated that they remove a metal element, responsible for factor VIII activity, from the plasma.The effects of these metal chelating anti coagulant agents are cumulative, with the result that factor VIII activity constantly diminishes in their presence with the passage of time. Thus, if a unit of citrated blood is stored for more than a few days, under refrigeration, a substantial percentage of the factor VIII activity is lost. Although the coagulant activity of factor VIII is markedly increased or activated in the presence of traces of thrombin and other proteolytic enzymes such as trypsin, the increased activity is relatively short lived. The thrombin activation effect cannot be observed in coagulant inactive material. In general, whole blood collected from human volunteers in the presence of an anti coagulant. By the time the blood is centrifuged, frozen, stored, and used for fractionation to manufacture a cryoprecipitate containing factor VIII, the labile factor VIII activity has diminished to approximately half, or less, of the original activity level present in freshly collected plasma. This makes it necessary to fractionate larger quantities of blood to obtain a single unit of factor VIII activity.The art has long sought a technique for enhancing the yield of factor VIII activity in blood plasma and particularly in the cryoprecipitate that normally serves as the vehicle for administration of factor VIII to humans. It is an object of this invention to provide a method for generating factor VIII activity from inactive protein. Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for generating factor VIII activity in plasma by incubation of such material with a divalent manganese salt. A further aspect of the present invention is to provide a method for generating factor VIII activity in plasma cryoprecipitates by incubating the cryoprecipitate with a divalent manganese salt. A still further object of the present invention is to provide a new product comprising a plasma cryoprecipitate containing an effective amount for generating factor VIII activity of a divalent manganese salt. The foregoing objects, together with further aspects of the present invention, will be apparent upon consideration of the following specification. It has long been reported that incubation of normal plasma with sodium citrate, ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid EDTA and other metal chelating anticoagulants renders the plasma deficient in factor VIII see Casillas et al. Artificial Substrate for the Assay of Factors V and VIII , Coagulation, Volume 4, pages 107 111 1971 , and J.W. Bloom et al., A Rapid Technique for the Preparation of Factor V Deficient Plasma ,Thrombosis Res., Volume 15, page 595 599 1979 . Because of its property as a metal chelating agent, EDTA is commonly used as an anti coagulant in the collection of fresh human and animal blood. The metal chelating action is considered to be necessary to remove calcium in whose absence the blood clotting reactions do not occur. Whole blood is collected into anti coagulant citrate dextrose, anti coagulant citrate phosphate dextrose, sodium citrate, and sodium oxalate. Although anti coagulant heparin is not a metal chelating agent and acts through other mechanisms to prevent clotting, existing practice and regulation does not permit its use when only plasma as contrasted with whole blood is to be collected. A further drawback is that the lifespan of red blood cells in heparinized blood is somewhat diminished as contrasted with other anti coagulant agents. At the present time, sodium citrate is the anticoagulant most commonly used for plasmapheresis. Exposure of whole blood to the presence of the above mentioned metal chelating anti coagulant agents successfully removes calcium and prevents clotting. However, such exposure also results in depleting or destroying factorVIII activity. For this reason, it has long been thought that factor VIII procoagulant activity was dependent on the presence of calcium. However, efforts to regenerate such factor VIII activity in whole plasma, or in plasma derivatives e.g. cryoprecipitate , by the addition of calcium salts have been wholly unsuccessful. It has now been unexpectedly discovered that factor VIII is a metallo protein containing manganese and that manganese salts can be used to generate factor VIII activity from plasma proteins which do not display such procoagulant activity. This is surprising because calcium has long been considered the cation responsible for factor VIII activity. In practicing the present invention it is preferred to incubate a plasma cryoprecipitate whose AHF activity level has been depleted by exposure to a metal chelating anti coagulant, in the presence of a manganese salt. Suitable salts include the manganese halides, which are preferred, i.e., chloride especially preferred , bromide, iodide, fluoride , acetate, formate, citrate, oxalate, phosphate, nitrate, and sulphate. The list is not all inclusive and any pharmaceutically acceptable manganese salt may be employed in practicing the invention. It has been determined that manganese salt incubation for factor VIII procoagulant activity synthesis is best conducted in the range of between about pH3 and pH8.S, and preferable between about pH6 and pH7.5. The temperature at which the incubation is conducted is not critical, and successful pro coagulant activity synthesis has been obtained between about 4 and about 60 degrees centigrade, although optimum results have been obtained in the range of between about 25 and 45 degrees centigrade.As a general rule, incubation is preferably carried out at 37 degrees centigrade. Small quantities of inorganic salt buffering agents such as potassium chloride and sodium chloride are generally included in the incubation solution, but are not required. Preferably these agents are present in the range up to about 0.5 molar concentration. Inorganic bufferin agents including by way of non limiting example phosphates, citrates, oxalates, barbiturates, imidazoles, borates, acetates, formates, succinates, and other pharmaceutically acceptable buffering agents of the type conventionally employed in plasma chemistry may also be present in the manganese incubated blood fraction in a similar concentration range. Because AHF is only present in trace amounts in normal plasma, it would be necessary to administer large quantities of plasma to a patient in order to provide a therapeutic quantity of factor VIII. The likelihood of inducing an adverse immunologic reaction with antibodies carried in the patient s blood, taken together with the amplified risk of hepatitis attendant to such treatment, make it generally preferable to administer factor VIII in the form of a cryoprecipitate. Cryoprecipitation is the principle technique employed for the large scale production of AHF concentrates.In this technique, fresh frozen plasma is pooled, thawed at 2 degrees centigrade and the cryoprecipitate collected.The cryoprecipitate a viscous liquid material is generally extracted with a buffer of the type described above sometimes followed by adsorption with aluminum hydroxide to remove prothrombin and other contaminants. Alternatively, an AHF fraction may be obtained from plasma using solid phase polyelectrolyte resins. High purity concentrates of factor VIII may be produced from cryoprecipitate extracts by fractional precipitation with polyethylene glycol PEG , PEG and glycine, and ethanol. In general, between about 200 and 400 units by activity of intermediate purity AHF concentrate may be recovered from a liter of blood, while between 100 and 250 units per liter of high purity concentrates can be obtained.The pro coagulant activity of these concentrates which is substantially lost when contrasted with the higher levels of AHF activity initially present in the plasma from which they were obtained may be substantially restored and enhanced by incubation with manganese salts according to the present invention. Using the present invention, effective AF activity levels have been restored to cryoprecipitate samples in which the AHF activity level has been completely lost i.e. to 0 units of activity by exposure to metal chelating agents .Addition of manganese salts to plasma, plasma fractions or cryoprecipitate, and incubation under the temperature and pH conditions described above can also be used to increase the factorVIII activity yield from current levels between about 40 60 percent activity by a factor of approximately 50 percent to levels between about 70 90 percent activity. The manganese restoration principle of the present invention has been confirmed by ESR electron spin resonance spectroscopy and may be widely applied to other aspects of factor VIII blood chemistry. Thus, manganese salts can be used as an adjuvant to the anti coagulant compositions presently employed in the collection of whole blood to minimize the loss of labile factor VIII activity.In this aspect of the invention Mn salts in the range of 0.001 0.5 molar may be added to the anti coagulant e.g., sodium citrate solution present in the whole blood collection container. Factor VIII has also been implicated as being useful in the treatment of VonWillebrands disease. While the exact composition of the protein component of the factor VIII molecule is not available, the EDTA treated pro coagulant inactive cryoprecipitate has been separated into two fractions low molecular weight and high molecular weight proteins . The high molecular weight fraction has been identified as VonWillebrands factor. By coupling the process of the present invention with metal chelating treatments such as EDTA of factor VIII, it is possible to separate the relatively low molecular weight coagulant inactive protein from the high molecular weight VonWillebrand factor by affinity chromotography, gel filtration, dialysis, high pressure liquid chromotography HPLC or Amicon type filtration.The low molecular weight factor VIII protein may be incubated with manganese salts to synthesize a pro coagulant active factor VIII metallo protein. This provides more potent factor VIII per unit of protein employed for therapeutic purposes and reduces the risk of hepatitus and immunologically negative reactions. The present invention makes it possible to employ EDTA or other chelating agents to destroy contaminating viruses such as hepatitis often present in plasma fractions. The factor VIII pro coagulant activity destroyed by exposure to EDTA may be regenerated by incubation with manganese salts to afford a factor VIII product that has a significantly lower risk of hepatitis attendant to its clinical use. The technique for cryoprecipitation of whole blood for the production of AHF concentrates are discussed in detail in articles by A.J. Johnson et al, Thromb. Death Haemorrh. Suppl. 35, 49 1969 J. Newman et al.,British Journal of Hematology, Volume 21, page 1 1971 , and H.L. James and M. Wickerhouser, Vox Sang, 23, 402 1972 . The technique for obtaining AHF Factor VIII fractions from plasma using solid phase polyelectrolyte resins are discussed in detail in an article by A.J.Johnson et al., J. Lab. Clin. Med., Volume 92, pp. 192 210 1978 . The principle upon which the present invention operates is believed to be that EDTA and other metal chelating anti coagulant agents decompose factor VIII by chelating manganese from the factor VIII molecule thereby destroying its pro coagulant activity. In total plasma and its fractions, the removal of manganese renders the materials clinically deficient with respect to factor VIII activity. The invention will be further described with reference to the following examples Example I A purified human factor VIII cryoprecipitate having an activity of 1.5 units per mililiter was incubated in solutions containing respectively 45 millimolarEDTA, 45 millimolar EGTA and water, at room temperature overnight. The resulting solutions were dialyzed four hours in .348 citrate, pH7.4 and assayed for clotting activity. U ml activity remaining EDTA nil 0 EGTA 0.42 30 H20 1.38 91 The results of this test show that there is a substantial loss of factor VIII activity attendant upon incubation with EDTA and less with EGTA. Example II An attempt was undertaken to regenerate factorVIII activity by incubating the inactive EDTA treated material of Example I with manganese chloride salts at 4 degrees centigrade for 48 hours. The result of this assay summarized in the table below revealed that manganese chloride is effective in regenerating lost factor VIII activity. F VIII Activity Salt mM Conc. U ml MnCl2 17 1.10 MnCl2 8.5 0.65 H20 nil Example III The EDTA human treated factor VIII described above Example I was tested in a conventional one stagePTT clotting assay, and in thrombin activation clotting assay. The assays verified the complete loss of factorVIII activity. Overnight incubation of the inactive material with calcium chloride 0.02 molar at 4 degrees centigrade had no effect on clotting activity. A significant increase in clotting activity from 0 to 0.25 units per mililiter was obtained by overnight incubation with manganese chloride 0.02 molar at 4 degrees centigrade.This regenerated factor VIII activity was increased to 17 units mililiters by activation with 10 ng m1 of thrombin. Conditions EDTA treated. human factor VIII was incubated in 17 mM metal salts at 4 degrees centigrade overnight. Thrombin activation was carried out using 10ng ml purified bovine thrombin,.37 degrees centigrade for 1 min., at which time an aliquot was removed for clotting assays.

Subsequent synthesis to active factor VIII metallo protein follows incubation with a manganese salt, preferably manganese chloride MnC12 . Example IV The following test was conducted to obtain a partial time course of regeneration of lost factor VIII activity. EDTA human factor VIII Example I as dialyzed in citrate buffer and incubated with 17 millimolar 0.017 molar manganese chloride at different temperatures.Aliquots were removed at timed intervals and assayed for clotting activity and thrombin activation. Parallel assays were run at room temperature and 37 degrees centigrade. The results of the assays are presented in the table VI below. TABLE VI Room Temp.

Within an 80 minute incubation period, activity rose from 0 to 0.7 units per mililiter. This material was thrombin activatable to 1.04 units per mililiter. Synthesis was slower at room temperature.A control experiment using water instead of manganese chloride provided no generation of activity. Example V Purified bovine factor VIII obtained according to the procedure of Schmer et al in The Isolation andCharacterization of Bovine Factor VIII , Journal ofBiological Chemistry Volume 247 pp. 2512 2421 1972 having an activity level of 3.3 units per mililiter and being eightfold thrombin activatable was incubated with 27 milimolar EDTA at 4 degrees centigrade overnight and dialyzed against 0.34 citrate buffer pH7.4 . Clotting assays revealed that the EDTA treated factor VIII had completely lost its activity and was not thrombin activatable. Clotting activity was generated from 0 to 1.4 units per mililiter by incubating with manganese chloride 0.02 molar at 37 degrees centigrade for 80 minutes.Aliquots of the manganese chloride incubated material were withdrawn at timed intervals and assayed for clotting activity.
