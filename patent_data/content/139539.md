# Process for the manufacture of detergent powder.

## Abstract
A process for manufacturing detergent powder contain ing heat sensitive components is disclosed. The process involves preparation of two separate crutcher slurries, one containing the relatively heat stable components which is sprayed in a conventional manner and a second containing heat sensitive components which is sprayed into the spray drying tower at a level lower than the level at which the drying air is injected. Desirably the second slurry is sprayed in a direction which includes an upward component, so as to lengthen the pathway of the sprayed droplets.
