# Process for the preparation of optically active alpha arylalkanoic acids.

## Abstract
A process is disclosed for the preparation of optically ac tive alpha arylalkanoic acids, consisting in the rearrangement of optically active alpha haloalkyl aryl ketals and in submitting to hydrolysis the so obtained esters of alpha arylalkanoic acids. The rearrangement reaction is carried out under neutral or slightly alkaline conditions in a polar protic medium.
