# A SEMICONDUCTOR LASER DEVICE

## Abstract
A semiconductor laser device comprises an active layer 3 , a current blocking striped channel 7 formed below said active layer in such a manner that light in the active layer for laser oscillation is absorbed by both shoulders of said striped channel, resulting in an index guided optical waveguide within the active layer, and mesa channels 8 formed outside of said optical waveguide in a manner to cut off the active layer, the distance W between the mesa channels 8 being greater than that w between the shoulders of said striped channel 7 .
