# Method for production of metal magnetic particles.

## Abstract
Method for the production of uniform acicular metal ma gnetic particles comprising predominantly iron which have ex cellent magnetic characteristics and are useful as a recording element for a magnetic recording medium, said method com prising the steps of coating the surface of metal compound particles containing predominantly acicular iron oxyhydroxide or iron oxides with at least one member selected from the group consisting of an aluminum compound and a silicon com pound, pelletizing the coated particles, and reducing the pel lets with heating under reducing atmosphere, e.g. under hy drogen stream.
