# Motion compensators.

## Abstract
A compensator for providing resilience in a connection between relatively moveable objects comprises a piston 3 working in a cylinder 2 which is surrounded by a larger coaxial cylinder 1 joined thereto by annular wall members 1a thus defining about the cylinder 2 a pair of annular reservoirs 8,9, The piston 3 divides the cylinder 2 into a pair of chambers 6, 7 , chamber 6 being connected by conduit 12 to reservoir 9 and chamber 7 being connected by conduit 10 to reservoir 8 . Each reservoir contains a mixture of liquid and gas whilst the chambers contain liquid. Elongation of the connection between the objects causes withdrawal of the piston 3 with consequent expansion of the volume of gas in reservoir 9 against atmospheric pressure and against pressure developed in reservoir 8 as a consequence of decrease of gas volume therein.
