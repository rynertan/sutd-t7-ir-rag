# Optical recording and retrieving disc.

## Abstract
An optical disc for optical recording, retrieving and erasing of informations. The phase difference Ψ of reflected light produced by the tracking groove in the form of convexity or protrusion or concavity or groove and the change ΔΨ in the phase difference caused by a recording in a recording film are selected in relation to each other to provide a stable detection signal for tracking, thereby to permit a ighly accurate tracking on the optical disc carrying information at a high density.
