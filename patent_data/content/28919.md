# Magnetic brush roll and developing or cleaning apparatus incorporating same.

## Abstract
A magnetic brush roller 38 or 40 for use in a develop ment or cleaning apparatus of a reproducing machine is described as well as a development or cleaning apparatus 36 incorporating such a roller. The roller 38 or 40 has a magnetic member 72 or 80 in which the magnetic portion 90, 94 or 100 thereof is magnetized to saturation impressing a plurality of magnetic poles thereon. At least one non magnetic portion 92, 96 or 102 is integral with the magnetic portion 90, 94 or 100 so that the volume of magnetic material within the magnetic member 72 or 80 varies producing a magnetic field having a pre selected intensity profile.
