# Voltage frequency converter.

## Abstract
A voltage frequency converter is formed of a V F conver ter circuit 10, 12 which converts an input potential ei into a frequency fc corresponding to the instantaneous value of the input potential ei , and a difference detection circuit 14 to 26 which generates an output ej corresponding to the differ ence between the output frequency fc of the V F Converter circuit 12 and a predetermined reference frequency fo . The V F converter circuit 10, 12 is controlled according to the level of the output ej from the difference detection circuit 26 , thereby reducing the deviation of the output frequency fc of said V F converter circuit 12 from the reference fre quency fo .
