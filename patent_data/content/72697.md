# Outrigger device for wheel mounted working machines.

## Abstract
An outrigger device for wheel mounted working machines comprises a fixed box 2 secured to a wheel mounted traveling body 1 , an extensible beam 3 storably fitted in the fixed box 2 , and a jack cylinder 5 having a float 6 on the lower end thereof and pivotally connected to the front end of the extensible beam 3 , the jack cylinder 5 being swingable around the axis of the pivot 53 between a vertical position and a stored position where it is inwardly drawn into the extensive beam 3 . Thus, when the outrigger is stored, the jack cylinder 5 is drawn toward the extensible beam 3 while turning around the axis of the pivot 53 at its upper end until it is stored in the beam in an inclined state. This novel arrangement minimizes the amount of projection of the jack cylinder 5 above the machine and makes it possible to receive the float 6 within the machine width while providing protection of the rod 52 of the jack cylinder 5 and increased durability of the cylinder.
