# Titanium vanadium catalyst and process for ethylene polymerization.

## Abstract
A catalyst for producing ethylene polymers in which a first component composed of titanium, vanadium, halogen, and OR groups, wherein R is selected from among alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, acyl, and combinations thereof, is combined with an organometallic compound. A method for producing a catalyst system in which an organoaluminum compound component is contacted with a component composition produced by reacting a mixture of titanium and vanadium compounds with an organometallic compound to form a product mixture which is then contacted with titanium tetrachloride. A method for producing polymers of ethylene by contacting ethylene with a catalyst system produced as above under conditions suitable for polymerization.
