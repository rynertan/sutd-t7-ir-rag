# Corrosion resistant and wear resistant amorphous alloy and a method for preparing the same.

## Abstract
There are disclosed a corrosion resistant and wear resis tant amorphous alloy characterized by having, on the surface thereof, an oxide layer including a crystalline oxide and a meth od for preparing the same characterized by carrying out the ox idation treatment of the amorphous alloy at a high temperature and at a high pressure in order to form an oxide layer including a crystalline oxide on the surface of the amorphous alloy. The amorphous alloy according to this invention pos sesses a remarkable corrosion resistance and wear resistance and had an improved magnetic permeability in the mega Hertz zone.
