# Electrophoretic display with X Y addressing.

## Abstract
An electrophoretic display device comprises a first panel and a second panel spaced a predetermined distance apart and at least one of said panels is transparent. A main first electrode adhers to the first panel and a main second electrode adhers the second panel. An opaque insulating fluid is disposed between the first and second electrodes and contains particles of at least one colour pigment in suspension. A substantial number of the particles has a charge of one polarity. An insulating layer is adherently provided at least partially over the second electrode. A third electrode is interposed between the first and second electrodes and is separated at least in part by the insulating layer. The third electrode is a control electrode for selectively adjusting the electric field between the first and second electrodes to establish a threshold for transporting the particles depending on the direction of the electric field, causing an image to be formed on the main electrodes by the presence or absence of said particles.
