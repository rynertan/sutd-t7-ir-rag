A method of adjusting the amount of water contained in a paper sheet in a drying step in a paper making process, together with a dryer cylinder used in this method. A dryer cylinder 3 on which a synthetic fiber cloth 2 having fiber gaps 4 is wound and secured is provided at a predeter mined position where it contacts a wet web 1 . The wet web 1 is subjected to a drying treatment while the air retained in the fiber gaps 4 is being made to act as a heat insulating material, whereby the amount of water contained in the paper sheet is uniformly adjusted over the entire width thereof.
