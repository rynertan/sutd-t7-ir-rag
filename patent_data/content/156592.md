## Description
This invention relaxes to sustained release pharmaceutical capsules, more particularly to such capsules containing a high molecular weight hydroxypropylmethylcellulose. The convenience and advantages of administering a single dose of medication which provides prolonged or sustained release as opposed to the administration of a number of single doses at regular intervals are indisputable.Conventionally, sustained release is achieved by controlling dissolution and or diffusion of the medicament from the dosage form. Several carrier materials which are employed for this purpose include waxes, fatty materials, polymers, natural, synthetic and semi synthetic gums, etc. Among the gums, hydroxypropylmethylcelluloses constitute an important class of materials because of their pH independent effect as well as their synthetic origin as opposed to the natural gums such as alginates, Karaya, Guar, Locust bean, etc. The use of hydroxypropylmethylcelluloses as carrier bases in sustained action tablets has been well established.For example, Christensen et al. U.S. Patent 3,065,143 teach sustained release tablets which contain a hydroxypropylmethylcellulose which, upon contact with gastric fluid, swells and forms a water impermeable barrier on the tablet surface thereby providing sustained release by diffusion of drug through the barrier. It is clear from their teachings that the gum has to be pressed into a tablet for it to work as a sustained action agent. Sheth et al U.S. Patent 4,167,558 disclose sustained release tablets containing hydroxypropylmethylcellulose 60 HG.Again the dosage form is tablet and in addition there is a restriction on the density of the tablets to assure buoyancy and release the whole of the medicament in the stomach. Lowey et al. U.S. Patent 3,870,790 disclose a solid, compressed buccal product containing low molecular weight hydroxypropylmethylcellulose which has been modified by humidification and air drying. Similarly,Schor U.S. Patent 4,226,849 disclosed the invention of tablets, lozenges, suppositories and or other compressed dosage forms, which have prolonged release wherein the hydroxypropylmethylcellulose has been subjected to hydrolysis and oxidation to generate a desired minimum concentration of carbonyl and carboxyl groups. The hydroxypropylmethylcellulose used in these teachings are of low molecular weight. In another patent U.S.Patent 4,389,393 Schor et al. disclose the use of high molecular weight hydroxypropylmethylcelluloses in low concentrations for achieving sustained drug release action from compressed solid dosage forms. The hydroxypropylmethylcelluloses used by Schor et al. have a molecular weight above 50,000, a methoxyl content of 16 24 and hydroxypropoxyl content of 4 32 . Thus, Schor et al. 4,389,393 require that the material be compressed and it is clear from these teachings and those of Christensen et al. U.S. Patent 3,065,143 ,Sheth et al. 4,167,558 , Lowey et al. 3,870,790 andSchor et al. 4,226,849 and 4,389,393 that compression is essential for the formation of a diffusion barrier layer on the surface of the oral dosage form to provide sustained action. Sheth and Tossounian U.S. Patent 4,126,672 showed that hydroxypropylmethylcellulose provides sustained release in a buoyant capsule dosage form. However, because of the buoyancy constraints, the density of the capsules may have to be adjusted by the use of a fatty material so that the capsules float in the gastric fluid.It is clear from their teachings that floating is essential for their concept to work. Henderson et al U.S. Patent 3,427,378 disclose capsules for sustained release of medicament wherein a gum such as sodium alginate is incorporated into the pharmaceutical formulation in an amount of from 70 to 99 per cent by weight and preferably 85 to 98 per cent and the capsules are, as a critical feature, completely filled. This invention provides a unit dosage form for a√†m inlstratlon of a therapeutic agent, which does not require expensive compression and granulation processing characteristic of the prior art sustained release tablets, or density control restraints characteristic of the prior art capsules, while providing substantially the same slow drug release heretofore obtained with compressed tablets.The unit dosage form of this invention provides sustained release of drug independent of gastrointestinal pH and is therefore equally effective both in the stomach and intestine. By independent , it is not meant that no change in dissolution rate occurs with change of pH, but that any change is so insubstantial that drug delivery is not meaningfully altered. In essence, it has been discovered that pharmaceutical compositions formulated with relatively high molecular weight hydroxypropylmethylcellulose 50,000 which heretofore have been employed in the production of compressed unit dosage forms such as tablets, buccal lozenges, suppositories, etc. may be used without compression in hard gelatin capsuleS without loss of the sustained release effect observed in compressed tablets.Although the pharmaceutical literature has well documented the necessity for compressing hydroxypropylmethylcellulosecontaining drug formulations to provide an external surface barrier to drug release, or for control of the density of an encapsulated drug formulation compounded with hydroxypropylmethylcellulose to provide buoyancy and hold the capsule in the stomach, applicants have found that neither of these preparative restrictions are necessary to provide a sustained release unit dosage capsule for administration.The formulations employed in this invention are not tailored to ensure buoyancy in gastric fluids and they are equally effective when administered in such manner as to be retained with a food bolus passing into the small intestine. No special attention or limitation as to internal porosity is required with the formulations of this invention. Thus, in accordance with this invention, there is provided a gastro intestinal, pH independent, sustainedrelease pharmaceutical unit dosage form comprising a hard gelatin capsule containing a pulverulent admixture of a therapeutically active medicament from about 10 to about 60 per cent by weight of at least one hydroxypropylmethylcellulose possessing a methoxy content of 16 to 24 weight per cent, a hydroxypropoxyl content of 4 to 32 weight per cent and a number average molecular weight of at least 50,000 and a pharmaceutically acceptable, nonpharmacologically functional adjuvant therefor. The hydroxypropylmethylcelluloses employed in production of the sustained release capsules are commercially available. In essence, any hydroxypropylmethylcellulose HPMC possessing the characteristics of Methoce H4M, K4M, K15M and K100M are applicable, individually and as mixtures. Each of these hydrophilic materials have a methoxy content of about 16 to about 24 weight per cent, a hydroxypropyl content of about 4 to about 32 weight per cent and a number average molecular weight of at least 50,000. The proportion of hydroxypropylmethyl . cellulose to total capsule weight may vary from about 10 to about 60 per cent to provide release rates of drug over a 6 to about 12 hour period. Although the release rates achieved with hard gelatin capsules containing drug formulations and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose in accordance with this invention will differ somewhat depending upon the specific drug being compounded, the sustained release effect is readily achieved. Modification of the release rate may be attained by altering the hydroxypropylmethylcellulose to drug ratio within the limits indicated above.Generally, an increased content of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose will prolong the release rate of a given drug as may be seen from the experimental data presented, infra. An optsu release rate is obtaned when near total dissolution of the therapeutic agent at a substantially uniform rate is achieved over a period of fro six t twelve hours and preferably in about eight hours. Any therapeutic agent suitable for oral administration may be formulated in conformity with this disclosure and encapsulated to provide a sustained release unit dosage capsule. Thus, tranquillisers, analgesics, antihypertensives and similar drugs may be readily formulated for use in sustained release capsule form. In addition to the therapeutic agent and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, other conventional additives such as fillers and binders microcrystalline cellulose, lactose, dicalcium phosphate dihydrate, etc. lubricants magnesium stearate, stearic acid, etc. glidants colloidal silicon dioxide, talc, etc. hydrophilic gums methylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, etc. disintegrants starch, sodium starch glycolate, etc. preservatives methylparahydroxy benzoate, benzoic acid, etc. antioxidants ascorbic acid, sodium bisulfite etc. and colourants certified dyes may be employed in the formulations for filling hard gelatin capsules without materially changing the sustained release rate of medicament achieved with the indicated high molecular weight hydroxypropylmethylcellulose material. The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention are prepared by blending an admixture of the ingredients and filling hard gelatin capsules therewith by hand or machine. Where the particular size of any one component of the composition, or the mixture in its entirety, is of such size as to detract from the production of a homogeneous or near homogeneous blend for subsequent processing, or the desired performance of the finished dosage form e.g. dissolution, stability, uniformity, weight variation, etc. , that component or the entire mixture may be milled to any desired size prior to a final blending and capsule filling. Accordingly this invention also provides a method for producing a gastrointestinal pH independent sustained release pharmaceutical unit dosage form comprising a hard gelatin capsule containing a pulverulent admixture of a therapeutically active medicament from about 10 to about 60 per cent by weight of at least one hydroxypropylmethylcellulose possessing a methoxy content of 16 to 24 weight per cent, a hydroxy propoxyl content of 4 to 32 weight per cent and a number average molecular weight of at least 50,000 and a pharmaceutically acceptable, nonpharmacologically functional adjuvant therefor, which comprises blending the above stated ingredients and filling them into said hard gelatin capsules. The following examples illustrate several specific formulations for filling hard gelatin capsules to produce sustained release doses of the indicated therapeutic agents.

The blend was then filled into hard gelatin capsules using a Zanasi LZ64 capsule filling machine. The above formulations provide sustained release for 6 12 hours in vitro as shown in Table 1. The dissolution rate study employed to obtain the data reported in Table 1 was performed in an apparatus conforming to that described as Apparatus 2 in U.S. Pharmacopeia XX page 959 1980 by the method therein described, at 50 r.p.m. or 100 r.p.m. The dissolution medium was 500 ml 0.1 N HCl for the first hour after which 500 ml phosphate buffer was added to afford a pH of 7.4, comparable to that found in the intestine. A spring coil was employed to sink the capsules and ensure that they did not float.

Thus, the advantages of capsule dosage forms with no loss of sustained drug release presently found in compressed tablets, clearly characterises the benefits of this invention.
