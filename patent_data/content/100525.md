## Description
ALIGNMENT ASSEMBLYThe present invention generally relates to an alignment assembly and, in particular, relates to such an assembly useful for externally aligning an element located in an ultra high vacuum.In the general field of charged particle spectroscopy, charged particles liberated from a target substance impinge upon a collector assembly which is adapted to produce a signal responsive thereto.The resultant signal from the collector assembly is then processed to provide a useful output signal indicative, or representative, of the elemental composition of the substance.Of primary importance to the accuracy of such an analysis is the positioning, or alignment, of the collector assembly with the charged particles passing through the charged particle analyzer. In early work in this field, the diameter of the particle beam, i.e. the incident beam, which liberated charged particles from the surface of the sample was relatively large and alignment of the beam with the analyzer was accomplished by, inter alia, deflecting the beam along its axis.As the art progressed alignment of the collector became more difficult and the various elements of not only the beam generating gun but also the analyzer had to be fabricated to extreme accuracy with corespondinssy small tolerances. One conventional electron spectroscope is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,205,226 issued to the present inventor on May 27, 1980 and assigned to the present assignee.Therein an internal collector alignment mechanism is described.However, the alignment procedure thereof requires about four hours as the initial instrument misalignment must first be determined, the ultra high vacuum broken and then the collector assembly adjusted.Thereafter, the unit is reassembled, the ultra high vacuum reestablished and the alignment checked. Often this procedure must be repeated to achieve the requisite alignment accuracy.Further, since the development of the art has resulted in smaller beam diameters, it has become increasingly impractical to employ beam deflection for alignment of the analyzer elements. This impracticality results not only from the extraordinary expense of achieving greater and greater mechanical accuracies, but also from the fact that excessive beam aberrations are introduced from relatively minor deflections of the smaller beams.Accordingly, it is on object of the present invention to provide an alignment assembly which is quite accurate and requires only a relatively short time to achieve alignment.This object is accomplished, at least in part, by an alignment assembly having a plate with a plurality of radial throughbores containing means for positioning and securing the element of a charged particle analyzer being aligned.Other objects and advantages will become apparent to those skilled in the charged particle analysis field from the accompanying detailed description, the following claims and the drawing appended thereto. The drawing, not drawn to scale, includes Figure 1, which is a sectional pictorial view of an instrument including a charged particle analyzer embodying the principles of the present invention Figure 2A, which is a cross sectional view of the analyzer shown inFigure 1 taken along the line 2 2 thereof Figure 2B, which is a cross sectional view depicting another embodiment of the present invention andFigure 3, which is another sectional view of a portion of an analyzer.Although the present invention generally relates to any charged particle spectroscopic instrument, the following description pertains to an electron spectroscope, in particular, an Auger electron spectroscope.An Auger electron spectroscopic instrument, generally indicated at 10 in Figure 1, embodying the principles of the present invention, includes an electron beam source 12 , having beam control elements including a beam blanking element 14 , a condenser lens 16 , first beam steering plates 18 , a variable objective aperture 20 , second beam steering plates 22 , and a fixed objective lens 24 .The instrument 10 further includes an Auger electron analyzer 26 including, in this embodiment, a cylindrical mirror analyzer 28 , a collector assembly 30 and an alignment assembly 32 .As known in the art, the above elements are encased within the interior of a housing 34 which, during operation, is pumped down to an ultrahigh vacuum herein the term ultra high vacuum is used to designate a pressure of less than about 10 9tory . The electron beam source can be of a conventional design, for example, such as that described in U.S. Patent No. 4,205,226, the entirety of which is incorporated by reference herein. Further, the conventional beam focusing and shaping elements discussed above are also described sufficiently therein and further description thereof is not believed to be warranted for a complete understanding of the present invention.The departure from the conventional instrument which is the subject of the present invention is the provision of the alignment assembly 32 between the target side 36 and the beam source side 38 of the collector assembly 30 . In the preferred embodiment, the alignment assembly 32 as shown inFigure 2, includes a flange plate 40 having an aperture 42 therethrough. Preferably, the aperture 42 is circular and coaxial with the flange plate 40 and has a diameter of about 4 cm and which loosely accepts the collector assembly 30 therewithin. The flange plate 40 further includes a plurality of spaced apart throughbores 44 extending from the perimeter 46 of the flange plate 40 and cotmiunicating with the aperture 42 . In the preferred embodiment, there are four throughbores 44 equally spaced about the perimeter 46 . Of course, as will be readily apparent from the description below, as few as three throughbores 44 would also suffice.Preferably, although not necessarily, the throughbores 44 all lie in the same plane, which plane is substantially perpendicular to the axis of the beam path.In this embodiment, each throughbore 44 includes a plunger 48 extendable into, and retractable from, the aperture 42 by a push rod 50 controllable external the perimeter 46 of the flange plate 40 . Each push rod 50 extends through a bellows 52 within the throughbore 44 , which bellows 52 is capable of sustaining an ultra high vacuum thereacross. One such bellows 52 is manufactured and marketed as part number 321 4 X 2 by CAJON Company of Solon, Ohio. In one specific embodiment, the flange plate 40 has an outside diameter of about 25 cm and a thickness of about 2.5 em. Each of the throughbores 44 includes a comparatively wider portion 54 which extends inwardly from the perimeter 46 and a comparatively narrower portion 56 which exits into the aperture 42 . A plunger retaining shoulder 58 is thus formed within the throughbore 44 at the interface. Preferably, the comparatively wider portion 54 has a diameter of about 1.2 cm and the comparatively narrower portion 56 has a diameter of about 0.25 cm.In this embodiment, the plunger 48 includes a head section 60 having a diameter comparatively larger than the diameter of the narrower portion 56 , which diameter is cooperatively compatible with movement within the wider portion 54 , which head section 60 , when the plunger 48 is fully extended, rests upon shoulder 58 . The plunger 48 also includes a contact rod 62 extending from the head section 60 and extending through the comparatively narrower portion 56 of the throughbore.The push rod 50 contacts the head section 60 at one end 64 thereof and extends outwardly therefrom. Preferably, the push rod 50 includes a threaded portion 66 at the other end 68 thereof, which threaded portion 66 is threaded into a threaded bore 70 of a flange 72 affixed to the perimeter 46 of the flange plate 40 . Thus, the push rod 50 , by means of a screwdriver, for example, can be urged toward the aperture 42 or withdrawn therefrom.In practice, the push rods 50 are used in conjunction with the plunger 48 as a means for positioning and securing the collector assembly 30 within the housing 34 .In an alternative embodiment, shown in Figure 2B two adjacent throughbores 44A are provided with plungers 48 each being urged toward the aperture 42 by means of a spring 74 . Further, the throughbores 44A are sealed, for example, by known techniques such as welding, to maintain the desired ultra high vacuum therewithin.Preferably, the springs 74 are capable of exerting a force between 10 to 50 pounds. Thus, in this embodiment the spring loaded plungers 48 provide sufficient counterforce to the adjustable plungers, i.e., those protruding from the throughbores 44 , to allow both alignment of the collector assembly 30 but also sufficient counterforce to secure the assembly 30 in the aligned position. As shown in Figure 3, means 76 are included for retaining the collector assembly 30 in the direction parallel to the beam axis.The means 76 can be implemented by use of a plurality of Z springs.Thus, the collector assembly 30 can be angularly aligned with the beam axis by adjusting the plungers 48 from outside, or external to, the ultra high vacuum.As shown in the embodiment of Figure 3, the throughbores 44 have a uniform diameter over the entire distance thereof. In such an arrangement the plunger 48 is rigidly affixed to the push rod 50 . Further, to maintain, or enhance, the alignment of the plunger 48 a bracket 78 having a pair of guidearms 80 affixed thereto is provided such that the guide arms 80 extend into the aperture 42 . The guide arms 80 are provided with guide holes 82 through which the contact rod 62 of the plunger 48 is passed. Preferably, the axes of the guide holes 82 are aligned with the axis of the throughbore 44 . In one particular arrangement, the flange plate 40 is configured to include mounting wall 84 extending beyond the throughbores 44 and into the aperture 42 . The wall 84 has a reduced thickness compared to the thickness of the flange plate 40 , which is cooperatively dimensioned such that the guide holes 82 , are axially aligned with the throughbore 44 when the bracket 78 is rigidly affixed to the wall 84 . The flange plate 40 can be configured using well known machining techniques.The preferred procedure of alignment is discussed below. The instrument 10 is assembled and provided with a target, for example, a copper target, and a 3Kev beam having a diameter between 100A I00 micrometers is directed threat The push rods 50 are adjusted until the collector assembly 30 is receiving the maximum reflected electrons, i.e., the collector assembly 30 is centered on the elastic peak of liberated electrons. The entire procedure can be easily accomplished in 5 to 10 minutes and the alignment is 2 to 3 times more accurate than conventional systems. Although the present invention has been described herein by means of a preferred embodiment, it will be understood that other configurations and modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention which is deemed limited only by the appended claims and the reasonable interpretation thereof.
