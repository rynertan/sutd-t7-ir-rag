# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR AUTOMATIC TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENT

## Abstract
An electrical circuit for coupling to probes coupled to a patient for measuring the body temperature of the patient. A first circuit portion when coupled to the probe which may be selected from a plurality of different probe types generates an electrical signal representative of the patient s body tem perature at the location of the coupling of the probe thereto. A second circuit converts the electrical signal to a tempera ture reading in degrees on a preselected scale. The second circuit includes an identifying circuit which automatically identifies the type of probe to which the first circuit is cou pled short circuit detection a digitizing circuit for digitizing the electrical signal from the first circuit and a processing means including a look up table for each probe type for de termining the temperature reading in degrees from the digi tized signal and the output of the identifying circuit. The first circuit includes a linearization circuit for partially linear izing the proportionality of the electrical signal with patient temperature. A plurality of temperature channels may be provided with the inclusion of an electrical switching circuit for sequentially coupling each of the probes to the digitizing circuit.
