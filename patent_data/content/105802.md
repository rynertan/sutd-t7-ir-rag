# PROGRAMMABLE READ ONLY MEMORY

## Abstract
Unique EPROM and EEPROM devices are provided with a composite dielectric layer between the control gate and the floating gate which is sufficiently thick to provide electrical and physical integrity but also has a high equivalent dielectric constant. The use of the composite dielectric layer alleviates certain problems experienced in the prior art EPROM and EEPROM devices which utilize a polycrystalline silicon floating gate and a polycrystalline silicon control gate separated by an SiOâ‚‚ dielectric layer, such as the problems of sharp silicon points polysilicon grain growth causing low dielectric breakdown strength. In contrast to the prior art, a composite dielectric layer serves as a partially relaxable dielectric between the control gate and the floating gate of an EEPROM or an EPROM. The composite dielectric layer provides high capacitance between the floating gate and the control gate without the insulative and breakdown problems encountered with prior art thin dielectric layers, with electron injection taking place through the gate oxide between the drain extension end the floating gate, EEPROM , and between the channel and the floating gate EPROM . In another embodiment of this invention, the composite dielec tric layer is implemented between the drain extension EEPROM or the channel EPROM and the floating gate and serves as the tunnel oxide.
