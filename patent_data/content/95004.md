# SPRING MATTRESSES

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for connecting together porous layers of a spring mattress structure are described. A film of plastics material 12 which plasticises at a low temperature is interposed between the layers 5, 7 to be joined, and, at a convenient stage in the construction of the mattress, hot air is delivered to the film so as to plasticize it and thereby join the layers 5, 7 .
