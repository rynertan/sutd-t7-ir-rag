# A reel shaft device of a magnetic recording tape running apparatus.

## Abstract
A reel shaft device comprises a reel hub engaging mem ber 76 a rotating member 102 capable of rotating re latively to the reel hub engaging member a driving member 86 having a circumferential surface 116 facing a cir cumferential surface 114 of the rotating member and capable of rotating eccentrically with the reel hub engaging member, the driving member to be rotated by a rotatory power supply means 64 a plurality of rolling members 118 disposed between the circumferential surfaces so as to be able to rotate a cam member 120 disposed on the surface of said rotating member, the cam member hol ding the rolling members in cooperation with the surface of the driving member to rotate the rotating member to gether with the driving member in one direction when the driving member rotates in the one direction, and dissolving the hold of the rolling members to allow the rotating mem ber to rotate independently of the driving member when the driving member rotates in the other direction and a variable rotation transmitting means 106 formed of felt capable of variable transmitting rotation between the reel hub engaging member and the rotating member.
