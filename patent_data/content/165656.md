# Improved stability oxygen scavenger compositions and method of use thereof.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a stable oxygen scavenger composition characterized in that it is adapted for storage without resulting in substantial sludge formation therein, said composition comprising a hydroquinone, b mu amine, and c a member selected from ascorbic acid and isoascorbic acid and water soluble salt forms thereof. It also relates to a method for reducing the amount of oxygen in an aqueous medium, characterized in that there is added to said medium an effective amount of a treatment comprising a stable solution of a hydroquinone, b mu amine and c a member selected from isoascorbic acid, ascorbic acid and water soluble salt forms thereof.
