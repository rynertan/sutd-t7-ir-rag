# Improvement in or relating to methods and apparatus for laser engraving.

## Abstract
The laser beam is passed through diffraction means 15 , which may be of any suitable form such as a diffraction grating, zone plate or diffraction aperture or a beam shaping mirror, and is then focussed onto the surface of the workpiece in the form of a diffraction pattern. In addition, the workpiece may be moved relative to the laser beam during engraving while preferably also varying the intensity pulse shape of the laser beam to produce the cells of different size and configuration. The disclosure also describes methods and apparatus for engraving an image or pattern on the surface of the workpiece by varying the output of the laser beam in accordance with stored image defining signals to produce cells of uniform or different size and shape while scanning the workpiece surface.
