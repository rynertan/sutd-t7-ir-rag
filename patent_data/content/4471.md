# Wrapping apparatus.

## Abstract
Wrapping apparatus to progressively wrap a paper sheet 16 helically about a longitudinally axially elongated generally cylindrical object such as a roll of carpet 11 comprises a frame 42, 43, 44 including a beam member 44 extending in the general direction of the axis 12 of the carpet roll, and at a higher elevation than said axis, a head 26 carried by the beam for displacement therealong, and support structure 18 carried by the head to support a sheet roll 16b of the wrapping material to rotate about another axis angled from horizontal and to directionally feed the sheet toward and into parallel and close tangency to the carpet roll 11 , in a skew feed direction 17 relative to its axis 12 , whereby as the carpet roll is rotated about its axis 12 by its driven support rollers 13 , said head 26 is displaced along the beam 44 and the sheet unwinds from the sheet roll and becomes progressively wrapped about the carpet roll. The beam is tiltable to return the head 26 to its starting position.
