## Description
SPECIFICATIONTitle of the Invention Multilayer Wiring Board and Method of Manufacturing the SameBackground of the Invention The present invention relates to a multilayer wiring board in which a mixture consisting of a glassy material powder and an inorganic oxide powder is multilayered as an insulating material, and a method of the manufacturing it. More particularly, the invention relates to a multilayer wiring board which is formed in such a way that a powdery mixture of insulating materials is employed for a green sheet and insulator paste and is multilayered by way of example, and a method of manufacturing it. In recent years, as electronic apparatuses have been endowed with multiplicities of functions, multilayer wiring is eagerly required of various wiring boards in order to mount IC or LSI chips. At present, alumina base multilayer wiring boards are applied as meeting the requirement. However, they invovlve the problems of high installation and process costs for such reasons 1 that the sintering temperature is as high as 16000C, 2 that the strict atmosphere control of N2 H2O H2 etc. is necessary for the prevention of the oxidation of a refractory metal such as tungsten or the burning out of an organic polymer, and 3 that plating with, e.g., Ni Au for soldering to a pad of, e.g., tungsten is needed. Especially, it is problematic that the manufacturing process becomes long because the period of time required for sintering extends over 20 30 hours. To the end of solving the problems, a multilayer wiring board is being developed wherein a glass powder or a glass ceramic powder which is an insulating material adapted to be sintered at or below 10000C is used for a substrate and wherein Ag Pd, Au Pt or the like which can be soldered is used as a conducting material. The sintered substrate of the glass powder or the glass ceramic powder, however, is low in the mechanical strengths represented by the flexural strength and has only the strength of 10 kg mm2 which is 1 2 1 3 of the strength of sintered alumina substrate. This leads to the serious problem that the adhesion strength of soldered pads is low and that the sintered substrate cannot endure practical use.In this regard, for the purpose of enhancing the adhesion strength of soldered pads and further enhancing the mechanical strengths of the glass base sintered substrate, not only the composition of the substrate but also a raw material powder is made finer. Usually the mean particle size of the raw material powder is made 1.0 pm 1.5 pm or less, thereby to attain the flexural strength of at least 15 kg mm2 which can endure practical use. However, when the insulating material is such fine particles, only a green sheet which is at most 0.3 mm thick can be attained by a green sheet preparation method based on a doctor blade method. In forming a multilayer structure, therefore, a sheet lamination method is employed wherein the thin green sheet is formed with wiring by printing and wherein a plurality of such green sheets are stacked into a lamination. This method is indispensable for forming the multilayer structure which consists of five or more layers by way of example, but it has the problem of necessity for apparatuses such as a puncher for forming through holes, a sheet alignment apparatus of high precision and a laminating apparatus. A screen print multilayering method which is another multilayering method forms a multilayer structure in such a way that a green sheet usually 1 mm thick is coated with a conductor paste and an insulator paste alternately by printing. With this method, a production apparatus for the so called thick film hybrid IC integrated circuit board in which a film circuit is formed on a sintered substrate by printing and firing is applicable, and a multilayer structure of up to five layers or so can be formed by a simple process. The method therefore has the merit that the process can be sharply simplified when it is compared with the sheet lamination method. For this reason, the application of the screen print multilayering method is desired in case of forming the multilayer structure of about five layers.Since, however, the green sheet for the glass type sintered substrate having the practicable flexural strength is limited to the thickness of at most 0.3 mm as described before, the sheet 1 mm thick required for the screen print multilayering method must be prepared.This necessitates the process that several sheets are previously stacked and then used. Besides, when a powdery paste of fine particles is printed and formed on a thick glass base green sheet formed by stacking thin sheets made of a glass material of fine particles and the green sheet is sintered integrally with a printed insulator film, there arises the problem fatal to a substrate that the sintered substrate warps greatly. Further, since the green sheet undergoes a dimensional shrinkage of 10 20 at the sintering step, the problem of the appearance of the deformation, peeling and wrinkles of wiring is also left when the printed wiring is sintered simultaneously with the green sheet and the insulator film. As described above, the base board of an insulating material for a multilayer wiring board is required to be low in the sintering temperature and high in the flexural strength. However, the compatibility is not easy. The following references are cited to show the state of the art i A multi layer ceramic, multi chip module, Proceedings of the 30th Electronic Components Conference 1980 , pp. 283 285, ii LOW FIRING TEMPERATURE MULTILAYER GLASSCERAMIC SUBSTRATE, IEEE 1983 pp. 314 319, iii Official Gazette of U.S. Patent No. 4,490,429, and iv Official Gazette of U.S. Patent No. 4,547,625.Summary of the Invention An object of the present invention is to solve the problems of the prior arts in the preparation of a multilayer wiring board, and to provide a multilayer wiring board and a method of manufacturing it in or by which the sintering temperature of a base board of an insulating material is low, the mechanical strengths represented by the flexural strength of a sintered substrate are high, the deformation of a conductor etc. or the warp of the multilayer board attributed to sintering is not involved, and a multilayer structure can be formed by a simple process. In order to accomplish the object, the multilayer wiring board of the present invention comprises an insulating substrate, at least two conductor layers of predetermined patterns which are provided on said insulating substrate, and an insulator film which is interposed between said conductor layers, said insulating substrate and said insulator film being made of an insulating material which is produced by sintering an oxide mixture of i 70 50 wt. of glass material powder having a composition of 20 30 wt. of SiO2, 18 25 wt. of Awl203, 18 20 wt. of B203, 1 6 wt. of ZnO, 18 28 wt, of BaO, and 1 8 wt, of MgO and CaO in total, and ii 30 50 wt. of inorganic oxide powder composed of Al203 powder and ZrSiO4 powder. In cases where the contents of the respective oxides constituting the glass material powder fall outside the specified ranges, disadvantages to be stated below arise, and any of the cases is unfavorable. When the SiO2 content is less, the flexural strength of the sintered substrate is low, and when it is more, the sintering temperature becomes high when the Awl203 content is less, the flexural strength of the sintered substrate is low, and when it is more, the sintering temperature becomes high when the B203 content is less, sintering in a short time is impossible, and when it is more, the sintered substrate undergoes the collapse of shoulders when the ZnO content is less, the flexural strength of the sintered substrate is low, and when it is more, the sintered substrate becomes porous due to inferior sintering when the BaO content is less, the flexural strength of the sintered substrate is low, and when it is more, the insulation degrades and when the total content of MgO and CaO is less, the sintered substrate becomes porous due to inferiorsintesing, and when it is more, the sintered substrate cracks. In the above, the expression the flexural strength is low singnifies that it is less than 15 kg mm2, and the expression the sintering temperature is high signifies that it exceeds 900 C. When the proportion of the glass material powder in the oxide mixture is less than 50 wt. , unpreferably z green sheet cannot be densely sintered and the sintered body becomes porous, and both the moisture resistance between the layers and the withstand voltage between the layers are low. In the worst case, the adjacent wiring layers might short circuit. Further, when the proportion of the glass material powder in the oxide mixture exceeds 70 wt. , the sintered compact of the green sheet undergoes collapse, and the patterns of printed wiring etc. undergo deformations ascribable to the flow of glass, so that such a proportion is also unpreferable. CaO and MgO constituting the glass material powder may amount to 1 8 wt. in total, and the mixing ratio of the two is not limited. Only CaO or only MgO may well be contained. In a preferable aspect of performance of the present invention, the inorganic oxide powder employed is such that Awl203 falls within a range of 0.4 0.7 of the whole mixture consisting of Al203 and ZrSiO4 by the weight ratio. With the mixture in this range,Ag Pd pads which are sintered and formed simultaneously with the green sheet exhibit a high adhesion strength of soldering. The mean particle size of the glass material powder and the mean particle sizes of the Awl203 powder and ZrSiO4 powder constituting the inorganic oxide powder are all 2.0 4.0 pm. The reasons why the mean particle sizes of the glass material powder and the inorganic oxide powder are set at 2.0 4.0 pm in the present invention are that, when the mean particle size of the starting material mixture is smaller than 2.0 pm, the green sheet sometimes cracks at a drying step in the preparation of the green sheet, and that, when it is greater than 4.0 pm, the rough surface of the green sheet worsens the smoothness of the surface of an Ag Pd pad film. Each of the conductor layers of predetermined patterns is made of a conducting material produced by sintering a metal powder mixture of 80 75 wt. of Ag powder and 20 25 wt. of Pd powder.The mean particle size of the Ag powder is set at 0.3 0.7 pm, and that of the Pd powder at 0.2 0.5 pm. By setting the particle sizes of the Ag powder and Pd powder of the starting material within the above ranges and setting the composition ratio ofAg Pd within the above range, the adhesion strength of the soldered pads could be rendered sufficient and the smoothness of the surfaces of the conductor layers could be rendered good. The multilayer wiring board of the present invention is manufactured in such a way that a green sheet having a thickness of, e.g., 1.0 0.2 mm and also an insulator paste for printing are prepared from the oxide mixture described above, that a conductor paste for printing conductor layers is prepared from the metal powder mixture described above, that the conductor paste and the insulator paste of predetermined patterns are alternately and repeatedly printed on the green sheet so as to prepare a multilayer structure, and that the multilayer structure is sintered by heating it at the highest temperature of 800 9000C for 5 30 minutes. The green sheet is obtained in such a way that the oxide mixture has a binder, a plasticizer and a solvent added thereto, is kneaded and then degassed to prepare a slurry, and that the slurry is put into the form of a sheet of predetermined thickness and then dried. The insulator paste is obtained by adding a binder and a solvent to the oxide mixture and kneading the oxide mixture, while the conductor paste is obtained by adding a binder and a solvent to the metal powder mixture. These methods of preparing the green sheet, the insulator paste and the conductor paste are well known except that the compositions and mean particle sizes of the oxide mixture and metal powder mixture are peculiar to the present invention. Here, the conductor paths of the upper and lower wiring layers can be formed in such a way that, in forming the insulator film, the corresponding parts are formed as through holes which are not printed and not coated with the insulator paste, whereupon they are printed and filled up with the conductor paste. Using the multilayer wiring board the manufacturing method according to the present invention as thus far described, in the first place, a green sheet 1.0 mm thick can be prepared, and the flexural strength of the sintered compact of this material can be rendered as high as at least 15 kg mm2. In the second place, a base bdard in which printed wiring is multilayered on the green sheet with a printed insulator film used for inter layer insulation does not undergo a warp due to sintering. In the third place, a printed conductor is free from peeling or deformation, and the adhesion strength of soldered pads can be rendered at least 1.5 kg mm2. In this manner, a favorable multilayer structure can be formed owing to the combination of the materials described above.Brief Description of the Drawings Fig. 1 is a sectional view of a multilayer wiring board in an embodiment of the present invention, while Fig. 2 is a sectional view for explaining a multilayering step in an embodiment of the present inventionDescription of the Preferred Embodiments As shown in Fig. 1, a multilayer wiring board produced by an embodiment is such that an insulating substrate 1 obtained by sintering a green sheet of a glass base insulating material and inter wiring insulator films 3 constitute a base board in which wiring leads 2 are formed, and that the wiring leads 2 are vertically connected by a conductor which is formed in vias conductor paths 5.

The sintering at the above temperatures was permitted by the use of the glass powder for the oxide mixture.As compared with the prior art alumina base multilayer wiring board whose sintering temperature was 1600 C, the invention could sharply lower the temperature. In consequence, the invention dispensed with apparatuses and processes required for the strict atmosphere control of N2 H2O H2 etc. for the prevention of the oxidation of a refractory metal such as tungsten and the burningout of organic polymers and could shorten the manufacturing process. For the same reason, in the present embodiment, a green multilayer wiring board in which the oxide mixture to serve as the insulating material and the metal powder mixture to serve as the conducting material were combined was permitted to be unitarily sintered at 800 9000C. Therefore, a warp ascribable to the sintering and the peeling and deformation of the printed conductor were not involved, and the manufacturing process could be shortened. Further, the metal powder mixture used with the oxide mixture in the present embodiment consisted of 80 75 wt. of Ag powder having a mean particle size of 0.3 0.7 pm and 20 25 wt. of Pd powder having a mean particle size of 0.2 0.5 pm, which were mixed.With the particle sizes and the composition proportions in the specified ranges, the adhesion strength of the soldered pads could be enhanced, and the smoothness of the film surface could be rendered good.

The melt was quenched, and the resulting material was pulverized into a glass material powder having a mean particle size of 2.0 4,0 pm. Step II Preparation of Green Sheet Each of the inorganic oxide powders which were the mixtures consisting of the Awl 203 powder and the ZrSiOq powder listed in Table 2 was weighed and mixed into the glass material powder prepared by the stepI, to prepare the oxide mixture as indicated in Table 3, Further, a binder for example, polyvinyl butyral , a plasticizer and a volatile solvent were added to the powder particles, and the powdery mixture was kneaded and then degassed to prepare a slurry. Subsequently, the slurry was applied onto a polyester film by the well known doctor blade method and was dried to prepare a green sheet 1.0 mm thick. The sheet was punched into a square each side of which was 12 cm, to form a green sheet shown at 11 in Fig. 2 as a substrate for printing. The slurry for the green sheet in the present embodiment was prepared in such a way that a the oxide mixture consisting of the glass material powder and the inorganic oxide powder and amounting to 1 kg, b the binder made of polyvinyl butyral and amounting to 60 gr, c the plasticizer made of butyl phthalyl butyl glycolate and amounting to 30 cc, and d the volatile solvent made of 60 vol. of trichloroethylene, 23 vol. of tetrachloroethylene and 17 vol. of butyl alcohol and amounting to 5 00 cc were kneaded, whereupon the kneaded material was degassed. Step III Preparation of Insulator Paste 50 cc of vehicle in which a polymer such as ethyl cellulose was dissolved in a volatile solvent was added to 100 gr of powder having the same composition and the same particle size distribution as those of the oxide mixture used for the preparation of the green sheet, and the powder was kneaded to prepare a paste for forming a printed insulator film. The vehicle was such that 30 gr of ethyl cellulose and 20 gr of polyvinyl butyral resin were dissolved in 500 cc of a terpineol. Step IV Preparation of Conductor Paste 40 cc of vehicle in which ethyl cellulose and polyvinyl butyral were dissolved in an alcoholic solvent was added to 100 gr of metal powder mixture which was the conducting powder of each of the compositions listed in Table 4, to prepare a conductor paste. The vehicle had the same composition as that of the foregoing vehicle used at the step III. Step V Multilayering Step This step will be described with reference toFig. 2. Using the ordinary thick film printing technology, wiring was multilayered on the green sheet 11. More specifically, the conductor paste prepared by the stepIV was printed through a screen mask for the wiring pattern of the lowermost layer, to form the lowermost wiring conductor paste layer 12 on the green sheet.Subsequently, the insulator paste prepared by the step III was printed through a screen mask for an insulator layer, except connection parts for an upper layer circuit, whereby an insulator paste layer 13 for an insulator film was formed. At this time, the connection parts of the lowermost layer for connecting the lowermost layer and the upper layer circuit were opened as through holes 14. Therefore, the through holes 14 were printed and filled up with the prepared conductor paste into vias conductor paths 5.Further, the upper layer circuit was printed and formed as the lowermost layer. To the uppermost layer, a conductor paste layer to serve as component connecting pads 6 in Fig. 1 was formed. Though not shown in the present embodiment, a construction can also be adopted wherein wiring is formed together with the pads as the uppermost layer circuit and wherein an insulator film is formed on the wiring parts except the pad parts. Step VI Sintering The multilayer structure having completed the step V, in which the wiring was multilayered on the green sheet by the printing method, was sintered in the air by a thick film belt furnace having a temperature profile in which 800 9000C was held for 10 minutes. Fig. 1 shows the multilayer wiring board thus obtained. Components such as packaged ICs, ceramic chip capacitors and input output clip leads could be connected with the pads 6 on the multilayer wiring board produced by the present embodiment, by the use of a Pb Sn eutectic solder. The multilayer wiring board of the present embodiment is formed via the steps I VI as described above. Next, Table 5 indicates examples of the combinations of the materials used in the present embodiment and also indicates the characteristics of the green sheets prepared according to the above steps. InTable 5, the compositions of the oxide mixture to serve as the insulating material are denoted by Nos.of the compositions in Table 3.

As to combinations not included in the present invention, 1 when the composition and particle size of the oxide mixture fall outside the ranges of the present invention, a thick green sheet cannot be favorably formed, and the strength of a sintered insulating material is low, so that a warp appears in the unitary sintered compact of a green sheet and an insulator film formed by printing. 2 When the composition and particle size of the metal powder mixture to serve as the conducting material fall outisde the ranges of the present invention, a conductor film obtained by sintering undergoes peeling, deformation or and wrinkles and affords a low adhesion strength of soldered pads. In addition, favorable results could be similarly obtained with the combinations of the materials listed in Tables 1 4 other than those ofTable 5. The above embodiments exemplify the present invention, but it is a matter of course that the present invention is not restricted only to these embodiments. As thus far described, according to the present invention, the problems of the prior arts in the preparation of a multilayer wiring board are solved.While the sintering temperature of a green material to serve as an insulating material is suppressed low, the mechanical strengths of a sintered substrate can be maintained high, so that a green sheet which provides a sintered insulating material having a high flexural strength can be prepared. Besides, in the unitary sintering of the green sheet and an insulator paste for an insulator film formed by printing, a warp does not appear, and a smooth conductor film exhibiting a high adhesion strength of soldered pads can be formed.Moreover, owing to the use of a simple printing method, a multilayer wiring board can be formed by a simple process.
