# Improvements in vehicle suspension systems.

## Abstract
A vehicle suspension system for a pair of wheels 5, 6 has two torsionally stiff members 1, 2 each of which carries an axle 3, 4 for a respective wheel. The load on each wheel is supported by a gas spring 11, 12 to which relative movement of the wheel and vehicle body 7 is transmitted. The springs 11, 12 are mounted in respective members 1, 2 which are connected to the body, and lever mechanisms 14 are provided to transmit the relative movement of the wheel and body to the springs, the lever mechanisms 14 also being connected to the body. The lever mechanisms are preferably bell crank levers 15 . The system may also accommodate a levelling system, and interconnections between fluid volumes of the springs, especially where the members 1, 2 are connected by a member 10 which is rigid in bending but torsionally flexible. The system is particularly useful as a rear suspension for a passenger car.
