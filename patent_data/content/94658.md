# Passive infrared intrusion detector.

## Abstract
A passive infrared intrusion detector is provided with a lens which has a plurality of first lens segments 48A,48B , each for focusing infrared radiation from various beams of sensitivity onto an infrared detecting element. Associated with each of the first lens segments is a second lens segment 49A,49B , with a displaced lens center, which serves to focus light originating within the detector device into a radiated beam, which corresponds in space to the region of sensitivity of the infrared beams.
