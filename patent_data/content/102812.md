# Storage or disposal cavern leak detection and loss prevention.

## Abstract
An environmentally acceptable gas is provided, under pressure, in the annulus 46 of a casing arrangement which connects a wellhead to an underground storage zone 40 containing stored product. Monitoring of the gas permits detection of leaks that might occur through casing leakage to an unsealed overburden. Leak detection and product loss prevention can be conducted without deleterious environ mental impact.
