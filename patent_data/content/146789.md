# Process for forming isolating trenches in integrated circuit devices.

## Abstract
A process for etching deep trenches to achieve dielectric isolation for integrated circuit devices the process insures obtaining substantially perfectly vertical trench walls 94 by precluding significant variation in etch bias during the trench formation. This is accomplished by interposing. between the con ventionally formed imaging layer 86 of photoresist and the masking layer 84 , two additional layers one layer being an organic underlay 88 which is applied over the masking layer of SiOâ‚‚ 84 the other layer 90 applied over the organic layer and being composed of silicon nitride or oxide.
