# Process for preparing bis or tris allyl carbonates and process for preparing polymers thereof.

## Abstract
The application relates to a process for synthesising car bonic allyl esters from polyhydric alcohols, which are reacted with diallyl carbonate in the presence of a basic catalyst, which can be chosen from sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, so dium alcoholate, organic bases or basic ion exchange resins. The final products obtained differ according to the ratio of the components of the starting mixture. This, in the case of di ols with a diallyl carbonate diol ratio greater than or equal to 10, the resultant product is constituted by the bis allyl carbo nate of the diol together with a quantity of less than or equal to 10 of oligomers represented mainly by dimers. If the ratio is less than 10, the percentage of oligomers rises until, in the case of an approximately stoichiometric ratio, it reaches a va lue close to 70 of the reaction product.
