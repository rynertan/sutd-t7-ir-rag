# Liquid development apparatus.

## Abstract
A liquid development apparatus for developing an electro graphic latent image formed on an image bearing surface 40A of a recording medium 40 wherein the liquid developer is ap plied to a region of a rotated applicator roll 34 with flow con trolling means 38 positioned in spaced relation to the surface of the applicator roll to meter the amount of liquid developer ap plied to and carried by the applicator roll. The flow controlling means provides for uniform supply of liquid developer to a me niscus formed in a development gap 35 between the moving recording medium 40 and the applicator roll 34 . The devel opment gap 35 is formed with the aid of a backrest electrode 50 positioned opposite to the applicator roll 34 over which the medium 40 travels through the development gap. The backrest electrode 50 may comprise a rotatably mounted roll. A voltage bias 56 is applied to the applicator roll 34 and an opposite bias voltage 54 is applied to the backrest electrode to improve image contrast and to adjust image quality relative to the particular type of liquid developer and recording medium being employed. Image quality may be further adjusted accord ing to liquid developer and recording medium tolerances by selectively adjusting the width of the development gap 35 through movement of the backrest electrode 50 relative to the applicator roll 34 . The toned image is dryed with a drying roll 58 in engagement with the moving medium downstream from the applicator roll and rotated in a direction opposite to the direction of movement of the medium. A bias voltage 60 is ap plied to the drying roll 58 to effectively erase loosely attached toner particles on the image bearing surface and thereby pre vent dryer roll smearing of the image.
