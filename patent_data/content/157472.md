## Description
Process for Polymerization of olefines The present invention relates to a process for the polymerization of olefins, and more particularly, to a process for the highly stereoregular polymerization of alpha olefins.Background Technology There are known processes for the highly stereoregular polymerization of olefins, particularly alpha olefins having three or more carbon atoms, by using a solid catalyst component composed essentially of magnesium, titanium, halogen, and an electron donor compound, and there have been proposed many methods for producing the catalyst component used for the polymerization. The cocatalyst component used for the polymerization of olefins is usually a combination of an organoaluminum compound and an electron donor compound. The electron donor compound is usually an ester of an organic acid. Recently, there has been proposed a new polymerization process that employs, in place of an ester of an organic acid, an electron donor compound containing a hetero atom such as nitrogen containing compounds e.g., piperidine, pyridine, nicotinic ester, etc. , sulfur containing compounds e.g., thiophenic ester, etc. , and phosphorus containing compounds e.g., phosphite compounds, phosphate compounds, etc. . The catalyst system used in this process is not so improved in its catalytic performance as compared with the conventional systems comprising an organoaluminum compound and an ester of an organic acid. Recently, there has been developed a new catalyst system in which the solid catalyst component is combined with a cocatalyst composed of an organoaluminum compound, a sterically hindered Lewis base and a Lewis base having no steric hindrance. See JapanesePatent Laid open No. 139511 1981. This catalyst system exhibits high catalytic activity and high stereoregularity but it does not outperform the catalyst system containing the conventional cocatalyst. There is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid open No.138706 1983 a process for polymerizing olefins in the presence of a catalyst composed of a titanium catalyst component, an organoaluminum compound, and a heterocyclic compound containing nitrogen or oxygen, said titanium catalyst component being composed essentially of magnesium, titanium, a halogen, and an electron donor compound which is an ester selected from esters of polyfunctional compounds, esters of monocarboxylic acid having a branched chain group or a ring containing chain group, and carbonate esters. This catalyst system, however, is not yet satisfactory in catalytic activity. It is an objectof this invention to provide a catalyst and process for the polymerization of olefins which makes it possible to produce in high yields olefin polymers having high stereoregularity. The present inventors previously developed a catalyst component obtained by contacting a magnesium alkoxide, a silicon compound having the hydrogen silicon bond, an electron donor compound, and a titanium compound with one another, said catalyst component providing in high yields olefin polymers having high stereoregularity and high bulk density. See Japanese Patent Laid open No. 198503 1983. It has now been found that the object of this invention can be achieved when the above mentioned catalyst component is combined with an organic compound of a metal of Group I to III in the Periodic Table and aLewis base having the steric hindrance. The gist of this invention resides in a process for polymerizing or copolymerizing olefins in the presence of a catalyst composed of A a catalyst component obtained by contacting 1 a magnesium alkoxide, 2 a silicon compound having the hydrogen silicon bond, 3 an electron donor compound, and 4 a titanium compound with one another, B an organic compound of a metal in Group I to III of the Periodic Table, and C a Lewis base having steric hindrance.The invention also extends the catalyst itself.

Methods 1 and 2 are described below. Method 1 1. Reaction of Magnesium Alkoxide with Silicon Compound The reaction of a magnesium alkoxide component 1 with a silicon compound component 2 is accomplished by contacting them with each other. The reaction should preferably be accomplished by mixing and stirring them in the presence of a hydrocarbon. The preferred hydrocarbon is a saturated aliphatic, saturated alicyclic, and aromatic hydrocarbon of carbon number 6 to 12 such as hexane, heptane, octane, cyclohexane, benzene, toluene, and xylene. ie mol of camonent 1 is preferably contacted with 0.5 to 10 mol, more preferably 1 to 5 mjl, of component 2.

The hydrocarbon may be used in any amount but preferably, an amount less than 100 ml should be used for 1 g of component 1. In the case where a hydro silicon halide is used as component 2, a gas will evolve upon contact with component 1, indicating that the reaction is proceeding. The composition of the gas and the analysis of the reaction product suggest that the reaction forms a compound in which the silicon atom is bonded in some way. The quantity of silicon atom contained in the reaction product is more than 8 wt in terms of the matter insoluble in an inert solvent, particularly n hexane or n heptane, at 650C. The contact product of component 1 and component 2 is separated from the reaction system and used for the subsequent contacting. It may be washed with an inert hydrocarbon like the one used in the contacting of component 1 and component 2. The washing may be carried out with heating. 2. Contacting with Electron Donor Compound The reaction product obtained in the above step 1. is then contacted with an electron donor compound component 3 . The contacting is accomplished by mixing and stirring them together or by mechanically copulverizing them in the presence or absence of an inert hydrocarbon. The preferred hydrocarbons are hexane, heptane, octane, cyclohexane, benzene, toluene, and xylene. The contacting by mechanical copulverizing may be carried out at 0 to 1000C for 0.1 to 100 hours.

Component 3 should preferably be used in an amount of O.005 to 10 gram mol, preferably 0.01 to 1 gram mol, for 1 gram atom of magnesium in the contact product of magnesium alkoxide and silicon compound. 3. Contacting with Titanium Compound The contact product obtained in the above step 2. designated as contact product 1 is subsequently contacted with a titanium compound component 4 . The contact product 1 may be washed with a proper cleaning agent such as the above mentioned inert hydrocarbon before it is contacted with component 4. The contacting of contact product 1 and component 4 may be achieved by simply bringing them into contact with each other but it is preferable to mix and stir both of them in the presence of a hydrocarbon such as hexane, heptane, octane, cyclohexane, benzene, toluene, and xylene. Component 4 may be used in an amount of 0.1 gram mol or above, preferably 1 to 50 gram mol, for 1 gram atom of magnesium in the contact product 1. The contacting in the presence of a hydrocarbon may be carried out at O to 2000C for 0.5 to 20 hours, preferably at 60 to 1500C for 1 to 5 hours. The contacting with component 4 should preferably be performed more than once. The second contact may be performed in the same way as mentioned above but in the case where the first contact is performed in the presence of a hydrocarbon, the second contact should preferably be performed after the separation of the hydrocarbon.Method 2 1. Contacting of Magnesium Alkoxide, Silicon Compound, and Electron Donor Compound A magnesium alkoxide component 1 , a silicon compound component 2 , and an electron donor compound component 3 may be contacted with one another simultaneously. This contacting should preferably be performed by mixing and stirring in the presence of an inert hydrocarbon such as hexane, heptane, octane, cyclohexane, benzene, toluene, and xylene. Contacting by mechanical copulverizing may also be employed. The contacting of components 1, 2, and 3 may be performed in the ratio of 1 mol of component 1 0.5 to 10 mol, preferably 1 to 5 mol, of component 2, and 0.005 to 10 mol, preferably 0.05 to 1 mol, of component 3. The contacting of the three components may be performed at 0 to 2000C for 0.1 to 100 hours. Each component may contain more than one kind of compound. The hydrocarbon may be used in any amount but it is usually 100 ml or less for 1 g of component 1. The contact product of the three components is used for the subsequent contacting after separation, orwithout separation, from the reaction system. Prior to the subsequent contacting, the contact product may be washed, as required, with such an inert hydrocarbon as used in the contacting of the three components. Washing may be performed with heating. 2. Contacting with Titanium Compound The contact product obtained in the above step 1. is then contacted with a titanium compound component 4 . This contacting is accomplished in the same way as mentioned in step 3. of method 1 . The solid product obtained in the above method 1 or 2 is washed, as required, with an inert hydrocarbon such as hexane, heptane, octane, cyclohexane, benzene, toluene, and xylene, followed by drying.

The liquid phase polymerization may be accomplished in an inert hydrocarbon such as n butane, isobutane, n pentane, isopentane, hexane, heptane, octane, cyclohexane, benzene, toluene, and xylene, or in the liquid monomer. The polymerization temperature is usually 80 C to 1500C, preferably 40 to 1200C. The polymerization pressure is 1 to 60 atm. The molecular weight modification of the resulting polymer is accomplished in the presence of hydrogen or other known molecular weight modifier. In the copolymerization of olefins, the quantity of other olefin to be copolymerized is usually less than 30 wt , particularly 0.3 to 15 wt , based on the olefin.The polymerization with the catalyst system of this invention may be performed continuously or batchwise under the commonly used conditions. The copolymerization may be performed in one stage or in two stages.Effect of Invention The process of this invention that employs the polymerization catalyst constructed as mentioned above provides in high yields olefin polymers having high stereoregularity over a broad range of melt flow rate. Thus it provides olefin polymers having high stereoregularity and a low level of ash content even when the deashing step is omitted.
