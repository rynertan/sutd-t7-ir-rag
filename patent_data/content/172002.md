# THE TREATMENT OF PISTONS

## Abstract
The detonation resistant material is applied to a piston 10 caused by pinking or knocking. The detonation resistant material, which may be nickel or a nickel based material, is applied to the upper part of the ring band 12 and around an annular portion 19 of the crown adjacent the edge 13 of the crown. The ring band is, before treatment, machined to form a recess 15 extending therearound which is filled with the detonation resistant material by a plating process. Thus, on the ring band, the detonation resistant material does not extend radially outwardly of the remainder of the ring band. This reduces the possibility of the detonation resistant material scraping or scuffing on the associated cylinder or liner during movement of the piston in the associated cylinder or liner and also reduces the likelihood of the detonation resistant material being scraped off.
