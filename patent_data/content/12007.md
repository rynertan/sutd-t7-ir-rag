# Automatic temperature compensated boiler thermostat.

## Abstract
A control apparatus for a fuel fired central heating boiler has a first temperature control circuit 17 including a first thermistor TH2 for sensing external ambient temperature and a second thermistor TH3 for sensing the temperature of the circulating water produced by the boiler. A second temperature control circuit 16 has a thermistor TH1 for sensing the temperature in the space to be heated. A relay RL1 is operated by the outputs of the first 17 and second 16 control circuits and itself controls the boiler. The first and second thermistors TH2, TH3 are connected in series and have different resistance temperature characteristics so that a given change in the external ambient temperature corresponds to a greater change in the temperature of the circulating water.
