# Dewatering solids suspensions.

## Abstract
In filter plate 15 pressing of solids suspensions, the suspensions are mixed with flocculant downstream of the press feed pump s 11 , the dose of flocculant being determined over at least a major part of the press cycle from the speed of the press feed pump s the or each of which is of the positive displacement type. The flocculant is preferably pumped to a mixer 14 wherein it is added to the solids suspension using at least one positive displacement pump 24 .
