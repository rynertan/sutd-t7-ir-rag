## Description
IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO IQDOPHQRS This invention relates to iodophor compostions and, in particular, to iodophor solutions suitable for topical application or iodophor solutions which, in use, come in contact with the skin, and which have inherent emolliency. The iodophor solutions according to the invention are particularly useful as teat dips in mastitis control in cows. Iodophors are carriers of iodine and are usually complexes of iodine with certain types of surfactants with detergent properties. It is possible for iodine to be taken up in chemical combination by high molecular weight surfactants and water soluble polymers.The surfactants may be nonionic, cationic or anionic but generally the most efficient and stable iodophors are compounds of nonionic surfactants, such as alkoxylated compounds having a free terminal hydroxyl group on the alkoxy chain. Though the iodine in an iodophor is held in loose chemical combination, part of the iodine is available and retains its bactericidal activity. lodophors may solubilise up to 25 by weight of iodine of which 70 to zoo may be released as available iodine when a concentrated solution is diluted. Solutions of iodophors can be formulated with acid and the bacterial action of most of them is enhanced by lowering the pH. Increases in temperature increase the bactericidal action of iodophors, but above 430C they break down with the liberation of iodine. Solutions of iodophors are conventionally employed in pre operative skin disinfection and for disinfecting instruments and blankets. They are also used in the food industry and in dairy sanitation, in particular, as teat dips for cows. The use of iodophors has largely replaced the use of steam in the cleansing and sterilisation of worktops and utensils in the catering and food industries, with consequent savings in energy. The main disadvantage of known iodophors is that with prolonged use they cause dermatological problems such as cracks or fissures which are thought to result from a loss of the skin s natural protective fats by a process of emulsification. It will be appreciated that nonionic surfactants are powerful fat emulsifiers and have a degreasing effect on the skin. This problem is particularly prevalent when iodophors are used as teat dips in bovine hygiene. The earliest iodophor teat dips employed the aforementioned alkoxylated compounds as the nonionic surfactant complexing agent and were particularly harsh on the teat skin. Continued use of such iodophor preparations resulted in a widespread incidence of teat cracking with concomitant risk of infection due to the harbouring of bacteria in cracks and fissures in the skin of the teats. The problem of teat cracking was significantly reduced with the advent of the iodophors employing alkoxylated lanolin as a nonionic surfactant. Such iodophors form the subject of British PatentSpecification No. 1144637. Alkoxylated lanolin, especially ethoxylated lanolin, has as an emollient effect which substantially reduces the incidence of teat cracking. Experiments have shown that no iodine can be detected on the udder skin approximately one hour after dipping of the udder in a conventional iodophor teat dip. This loss of iodine can be attributed essentially to two factors, the first being a high rate of evaporation of iodine as the film of iodophor attains body temperature and the second being a rapid reduction of iodine to iodide in the presence of oxidizable organic soil. Accordingly, if one uses an iodophor teat dip at the morning and evening milking sessions, there will be a period between the two sessions oi about 7 8 hours during which no active iodine will be present on the teat skin with consequent risk of bacterial infection or reinfection. If such infection occurs whilst the dermal tissues are fissured then mastitis normally results. It is an object of the present invention to provide an iodophor composition which has inherent emollient activity coupled with bactericidal activity. Accordingly, the invention provides an iodophor composition comprising a complex of iodine with a quaternary ammonium compound of the general formula I EMI4.1 wherein L represents an acyl radical derived from lanolin fatty acid, R1 is hydrogen or a C14 alkyl group, R2 and R3 each represent a C14 alkyl group, R4 i an alkyl, aralkyl, hydrozyalkyl or unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon radical, X is a compatible anion and n is an integer of from 2 to 5, in an aqueous medium. Preferably, the quaternary ammonium compound Q.A.C is a compound of formula I wherein R1 is hydrogen, R2 and R3 independently of each other represent a metLyl or an ethyl group, R4 is a C14 alkyl group or an ar C14 alkyl group, X is a compatible anion and n 2 or 3. Further, preferably, X is a halide, nitrate, sulphate, alkylsulphate or alkylphosphate anion. Most preferably, L represents an acyl radical derived from refined lanolin acid. An especially preferred compound of formula I is one wherein L is an acyl radical derived from a refined lanolin fatty acid, R1 is hydrogen, R2 and Rq are each methyl, R3 is ethyl, n 3 and X is an ethylsulphate ion viz lanolinamidopropyldimethylethylammonium ethosulphate. Commercially available lanolin Q.A.C. s are primarily used in the cosmetics industry and tend to be made and used in diol glycol solution, for example in propylene glycol as described for example in BritishPatent Specification No. 1590012 It has now been found that iodophor compositions according to the invention can be readily prepared from lanolin Q.A.C. s in the absence of any diol compound.Thus, lanolinamidopropyldimethylethylammonium ethosulphate per se has been successfully complexed with iodine to form an iodophor composition according to the invention. Many of the lanolin Q.A.C. s of formula I which can be complexed with iodine to form the iodophor compositions according to the invention have a consistency which is similar to that of petroleum jelly.With such lanolin Q.A.C. s it has been found easier to prepare the iodophor composition if the Q.A.C. is used together with a nonionic surfactant. Any commercially available nonionic surfactant is suitable.However, a particularly suitable nonionic surfactant isTEXOFOR V27 TEXOFOR V27 is a Trade Mark which is a polyoxyalkylene condensate of a linear fatty alcohol. Other suitable nonionic surfactants are i the nonionics referred to as polyoxyethylene derivatives of sorbitan fatty acid esters or alkyl sorbitan polyoxyethylene marketed under the Trade Marks Tweens , the most preferred being Tween 80 , also known as polysorbate 80 or sorbitan monowoleate and ii the nonionics referred to as polyoxyethylenepolyoxypropylene block polymers marketed under theTrade Mark Pluronics , particularly those having molecular weights ranging from 4,000 to 8,000 with approximately 40 70 of the polyoxyethylene hydrophilic polymer and 80 30X, respectively, of the polyoxypro pylene hydrophobic polymer, the most preferred being Pluronic F127 also known as poloxomer 407. Preferably, the lanolin Q.A.C. s should be used in an amount of 25 50 by weight and the nonionic surfactant in an amount of 50 75 by weight oi the lanolin Q.A.C. s surfactant mixture. Another especially preferred compound of formula I is one wherein R1 is hydrogen, R2 and R3 each represent methyl, R4 is benzyl, n 3 and X is a chloride ion. The invention also provides a method for preparing an iodopbor composition which comprises forming a complex of iodine with a quaternary ammonium compound of formula I. Preferably, the iodophor compositions according to the invention have a titratable iodine value in the range of 1.5 2.5a a a. The compounds of formula I are known and can be readily prepared by conventional techniques such as by reaction of a lanolin acid of formula II EMI7.1 wherein LAN represents the fatty acid side chain of a lanolin acid, with a diamine having the formula III EMI7.2 wherein R1 is hydrogen or a C14 alkyl group, R2 and R3 are C14 alkyl groups and n is an integer from 2 to 5, to form a lanolin amide of formula IV EMI8.1 The lanolin amide of formula IV is treated with a suitable quaternizing agent such as an aliphatic halide, aralkyl halide, ethylene chlorohydrin or alkylsulphate so as to obtain the corresponding compound of formula I. Especially preferred quaternizing agents include alkyl halides such as methyl bromide, ethyl iodide or isopropyl bromide, aryl halides, aralkyl halides such as benzyl chloride, alkylsulphates such as dimethyl or diethyl sulphate or ethylene chlorohydrin. However, any suitable known quaternizing agent can be used. The lanolin acid of formula II may be any commercially available lanolin fatty acid or mixture of such lanolin fatty acids. Representative diamines of formula III for preparing preferred compounds of formula IV which are then quaternised to form the corresponding compounds of formula I include dimethylaminopropylamine, diethylaminopropylamine, dimetbylaminoethylamine, and dlethyl aminoethylamine. The iodophor compositions according to the invention may comprise a mixture of compounds of formula I. The iodophor compositions according to the invention may also include one or more quaternary ammonium halide compound s such that the ratio of compounds of formulaI to said quaternary ammonium halide compound s is not less than 4 1. The iodophor compositions according to the invention will preferably have a total Q.A.C. concentration in the range 0.5 10 by weight, especially 1 5 by weight. The iodophor compositions according to the invention may also include a complex of iodine with a nonionic surfactant in addition to the compound of formula I. Suitably said nonionic surfactant may be an alkoxylated lanolin of the type employed in the iodophor compositions of British Patent SpecificationNo. 1144673, especially an ethoxylated lanolin or an alkoxylated compound having a free hydroxyl group on the alkoxy chain such as ethoxylated octyl phenol or ethoxylated nonyl phenol. However, in the compositions according to the invention the compounds of formula I should represent at least 20 by weight of the total surfactant present. The compound of formula I is preferably mixed with any additional nonionic surfactants used before complexing with iodine. The compounds of formula I have both emollient and antiseptic properties due to the bifunctional nature of the molecules of the compound of formula I, unlike conventional quaternary ammonium surfactants. The iodophor compositions according to the invention are particularly suitable for use as teat or udder dips hereinafter referred to as teat dips for cows for the prevention or control of mastitis. Teat dips according to the invention preferably have an iodine activity or available iodine content of between 0.25 0.75 by weight, especially 0.5 by weight. The total Q.A.C. concentration of teat dips according to the invention is preferably in the range 5,000 26,000 p.p.m. The invention further provides a method of disinfecting a locus which comprises applying to said locus an iodophor composition as hereinabove defined. The iodophor compositions according to the invention have superior emolliency to the iodophor compositions based on alkozylated lanolin described inBritish Patent Specification No. 1144637. The superior emollient of the compositions according to the invention is considered to be du. to their affinity as quaternary ammonium compounds for the keratin of the Lkin to which they become strongly bonded as do other quaternary ammonium compound.Nonionic ethozylated lanolin for example does not have this property. As quaternary ammonium compounds, the compounds of formula I have biocidal properties in their own right.Accordingly, it will be appreciated, for example, in the case of a teat dip, that after the iodine content of the iodophor composition has disappeared as described above due to natural evaporation and reduction of iodine to iodide, a film of the quaternary ammonium compound will remain which has both biocidal and emollient properties, thereby extending the protection afforded by the iodophor composition. The invention will be further illustrated by the following Examples. The Preparations illustrate the preparation of Q.A.C.s for complexing with elemental iodine to form iodophor compositions according to the invention. PREPARATION 1 Lanolinamidopropyldimethylbenzylammonium chloride a Dimethylaminopropyl lanolin acid amide One mole about 340 grams of warm lanolin fatty acids was poured into a flask which was fitted with a stirrer, thermometer, dropping funnel and reflux condenser. The air in the apparatus was displaced with nitrogen and the contents heated within the range 1051150C. Over the next 15 to 20 minutes 130 grams about 1.3 moles of dlmethylaminopropylamine were added dropwise and the temperature increased to 14O0C to 15O0C. This temperature range was maintained for some 7 to 8 hours. During the final 4 hours a vacuum was applied which it was possible to reduce to 1 mm Hg during the last hour when the temperature was raised to 160 C. The reaction mixture was thereafter cooled to yield the amide of the original lanolin fatty acids. b Quaterization of the dimethylaminopropyl lanolin acid amide About 200 grams of the dimethylaminopropyl lanolin acid amide were placed in a reaction vessel and heated to 750C. At this point 62 grams of benzyl chloride were dropped in slowly over a period of 1 hour and the mixture was maintained at 1100C for 3 hours. During the last hour of the reaction the pressure was reduced as before. The mixture was cooled to yield the final product the quaternary ammonium chloride of the lanolin fatty acids. The final product had the consistency of petroleum Jelly and the characteristic odour of a Q.A.Cb Analysis indicated circa 78 quaternization. PREPARATION 2 lanolinamidopropyldimethylethylammonium ethosulphate Dimetbylaminopropyl lanolin amide prepared according to Preparation 1 step a was heated to 750C in a reaction vessel and then an equivalent amount of diethylsulphate was added slowly over a period of one hour. The temperature was then raised to 11000 and maintained at that temperature for 9 hour. During the last half hour of the reaction the pressure was reduced to l mmHg. The mixture was then cooled. The final product had a consistency of petroleum jelly and the characteristic odour of a Q.A.C. Analysis indicated circa 80 quaternization. Example 1 The final product of Preparation 1 was mixed with a nonionic surfactant TEXOFOR V27 in a ratio of 1 2. 100 g of the Q.A.C. surfactant mixture was mixed with elemental iodine 11.5 g and the resultant iodophor diluted to 500 ml with deionised water and filled into 50 ml bottles. The iodophor composition so produced gave a titratable iodine value of 1.8X wlw using thiosulphate. The iodophor composition was diluted with water to give a solution having an iodine activity or available iodine content of 0.5 , which solution was then used as a teat dip. The teat dip so prepared was used in routine mastitis control in a dairy herd of 50 animals over a period of 8 weeks at the morning and evening milking sessions. Prior to the trial approximately 50S of the animals had some degree of teat cracking. At the end of the trial no animal who was free of teat cracking prior to the trial was found to have developed teat cracking. Furthermore, and more importantly, in the case of approximately 75 oi those animals who had teat cracking at the beginning of the trial, no teat cracking was evident at the end of the trial. In the remaining animals there was a considerable improvement in the condition of the teats. EXAMPLE 2 The final product of Preparation 2 5g was treated with iodine 2 g and the resultant iodophor diluted to 100 ml with deionised water and filled into bottles.An iodophor was thereby produced having a titratable iodine content of 1.8X. Before use as a teat dip the iodophor solution was diluted with water so as to give an iodine activity of approximately 5 g per litre. On dipping with the teat dip so prepared it was found that the quaternary ammonium lanolin compound, which has biocidal activity, was still present on the teats after two hours when the iodine had disappeared due to natural evaporation and also by reduction to iodide by organic soil on the teats, which acts as a powerful oxidant. Accordingly, the quaternary ammonium compound provides continued protection to the skin tissue against infection reiniection until the next milking session.

METHODS For convenience excised cows teats were used in preference to working with live animals. The teats were collected from recently slaughtered cows and prepared by the method recommended by Philpot et al 1978 J. Dairy Sci 61 950 955. The teats were frozen in plastic bags in lots of 10 and thawed immediately prior to the commencement of the experiment. The stock culture of Staphylococcus aureus NCTC 6571 was grown in Brain Heart Infusion Broth Oxoid incubated at 370C for 18 hours. The suspension contained 4.1 x 109 colony forming units cfu per millilitre. The iodophor prepartion used contained 5.0 Lanolinamidopropyldimethylethylammonium ethosulphate 10.0 Synperonic NP9 Synperonic NP9 is a Trade Mark 2.16 Iodine available Iodine 1.85 At the start of the experiment 32 arbitrarily selected teats were suspended on stainless steel books from elevated metal rods 16 test and 16 control teats . The selection of test and control teats was statistically randomised. The teat dip preparation was applied to each of the test teats by immersion to a depth of approximately 4cm. Control teats were similarly exposed to distilled water. The teats were maintained at ambient temperatures 21 2 C for a period of 15 hours. At the end of this time period each teat was momentarily dipped to a depth of 2.5cm in the stockStaphylococcus culture. The teats were allowed to dry for a period of 45 minutes. At the end of this time each teat was swabbed for 25 seconds with a neutrali8ing solution of 8 w v Sodium thiosulphate, 0.5 v v Tween 80 and 0.5 v v lecithin. This swab was discarded.A second swab, moistened in the neutraling solution, was then rubbed over the lover 1.5cm of each teat for a period of 20 seconds. After use the swab were snapped of into separate 4ml aliquots of a solutions of 0.1 v v thiosulphate, 0.1 v v Tween 80 and O.1S v v lecithin in Universal bottles. The swabs in neutralising solution were immediately shaken at a constant high epeed for a period of 5 minutes on a Stuart Flask Shaker. Decimal dilutions were prepared for each swabineutraliser sample. Pour plates were prepared over a range of dilutions using Blood Agar Base No. 2 Oxoid supplemented with 7 Bovine serum Oxoid as the culture medium. After incubation at 370C for 18 hours the number of Staphylococcus colonies was determined by direct counting.RESULTS Mean Count of S aureus recovered cfu per ml Control 6.59 x 106 3.3 x 106 Iodophor containing lanolinamido propyldimethylethyl 39.4 66.5 ammonium ethosulphate Standard Deviation. The results show that 15 hours after application the lanolinamidopropyldimethylethylammonium ethosulphate containing iodophor preparation still shows good bactericidal properties against Staphylococcus aureus giving greater than log 5 reduction in this test situation. BACTERICIDAL EFFICIENCY OF LANOLINAMIDOPROPTLDIMETHYL ETHYLAMMONIUM ETHOSULPRATE CONTAINING IODOPHOR TEAT DIP Laboratory tests were carried out to determine the bactericidal efficiency of a Lanolinamidopropyldimethylethylammonium ethosulphate containing iodophor teat dip against the following bacteria 1. Staphylococcus aureus NCTC 6571 2. Escherichia coli NCTC 10418 3. Pseudomonas aeruginosa NCTC 10662 4. Streptococcus agalactiae Fermentation type IV V.R.L. METHOD Stock cultures of the bacteria were grown in BrainHeart Infusion broth Oxoid incubated at 370C for 18 hours. The stock cultures were diluted to give working suspensions containing approximately 160 cells per ml. Bacterial concentrations of working suspensions and numbers of surviving bacteria after trial were estimated by culturing on Blood Agar Base No 2 Oxoid supplemented with 7 Bovine serum Oxoid . Trials were carried out in sterile test tubes at a temperature of 370C. Testing was carried out as follows Bacterial Suspensions were treated with the lanolinamidopropyldimethylethylammonium etho sulphate containing iodophor for a period oi 16 hours after which time the preparations were neutralised. Inactivation of disinfectant after the required contact time was achieved using a neutralizing solution containing 2.0 Lecithin, 2.0 Tween 80, 0.5 Sodium thiosulphate and 0.15 peptone. The results are shown in Table 1. The results show that the lanolinamidopropyldimethylethylammonium ethosulphate containing iodophor teat dip has excellent bactericidal activity against the bacteria tested. The trial shows that the lanolinamidopropyldimethylethylammonium ethosulphate containing iodophor teat dip gives a better than required kill even at low concentration 0.5 lanolinamidopropyldimethylethylammonium ethosulphate O.25 12 Table 1Concentration Staphylococcus Escherichia Pseudomonas StreptocoooccusLanolinamidopropyldimethyl aureus coli seruginosa agalactiae ethylammonium ethosulphate Iodine Q.A.C. I2 0.5 0.25 6.58 8.06 8.51 6.81 2.5 0.25 6.58 8.06 8.51 6.81 It should be noted that the quaternary ammonium lanolin derivatives used in the iodophor compositions according to the invention are quite different to quaternary ammonium compounds conventionally used in teat dips such as the quaternary ammonium compounds used in the teat dips of the Applicant 8 British PatentSpecification No. 1554615. As a comparison, if iodine is complexed with quaternary ammonium compounds of the kind used in the teat dips of British Patent Specification No. 1554615, the teat dip formed from such an iodophor will lose its iodine in the normal way within approximately 1 hour, leaving behind a surfactant film containing a quaternary ammonium compound having no lanolin moiety a part of its structure. Accordingly, such a teat dip will be harsh and have a degreasing action on the skin. Furthermore, the quaternary ammonium compounds will bind to the skin causing irritation even in the presence of ethoxylated lanolin which does not bind to the skin. Apart from their use as teat dips in the dairy industry, the iodophor compositions according to the invention can also be readily used in skin care as a pre operative scrub for surgeons hands as a preoperative wash for human skin prior to surgical procedures and as an active ingredient in antidandruff shampoos. A further use for the iodophor compositions acording to the invention would be as a prophylactic measure in swimming pools and leisure centres against transmission of foot infections caused by iungal or viral types of organisms, for example verrucae.
