# Relays.

## Abstract
A differential relay includes two apparatus 1, 3 each as sociated with a different monitoring point on the line 5 being protected by the relay. Each apparatus includes means for deriving digital data representative of the current monitored at the respective point, at time intervals defined by a clock within the apparatus. The two points are linked by a digital data com munication channel 7 , and information transmitted between the two points is used to compute digital data for the two points at substantially the same time, from digital data derived at different instants at the two points.
