# Shock and vibration responsive contact device incorporating two or more seismic elements.

## Abstract
A vibration detector incorporating two or more seismic elements. Shock and vibration responsive switches commonly employ a seismic element mounted on two parallel rods for indicating a break in an electrical circuit connected to the rods. These switches occasionally operate because foreign matter lodges between the element and one of the rods. These false alarms can be avoided by mounting two or more seismic elements 25 on rods 18 which are bent so as to provide concave surfaces 24 which support the elements 25 so that they remain in contact with each other, thus providing additional conductive paths between the rods 18 . Although all of the elements 25 would simultaneously lift off at least one of the rods 18 when subjected to shock or vibration, it is unlikely that this condition would result from foreign matter. Where the elements 25 are ferro magnetic, they can be mounted on straight rods 19 and urged together by a magnetic field.
