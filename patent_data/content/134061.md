# Method and apparatus for separating from each other the components of a mixture of oil, water and soil.

## Abstract
The mixture is passed via a distribution and pacification chamber 7 , which is connected to the supply pipe 2 and which has a large volume slowing down the speed of flow, into a separation chamber 3, 4, 5 where the flow of the mix ture is first guided upwards in a laminar flow through a first bundle of plates 16 having vertical flow passages, the flow being reversed, while retaining laminar flow, directly after leaving the said first bundle of plates 16 and guided down wards through a second bundle of plates 17 having ver tical flow passages which lead into a discharge chamber 33 having a throughflow cross section increasing towards the discharge opening 34 , where the separated compo nents water and soil, are discharged, while oil can be dis charged in the reversing chamber 26 between the first 16 and second 17 bundle of plates.
