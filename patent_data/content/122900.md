# APPARATUS FOR REFRIGERATION AND STORAGE OF PRODUCTS

## Abstract
Apparatus for refrigeration and storage of products, especially liquid food products, such as milk, in an insulated tank 10 . In the bottom of the tank there is disposed an evaporator 12 constituting part of a cooling coil in which a refrigerant circulates for keeping the tank contents cold. The product is supplied to the tank batchwise during certain time periods and the tank is adapted to hold several such batches of the product. To obtain a maximum average temperature of the product and the refrigerant for cooling with a minimum of energy consumption there is connected to the tank an insu lated container 24 adapted to hold a batch of the product to be kept cold, said container 24 being itself provided with an evaporator 28 included in a cooling coil for cooling said product batch to the desired low temperature at which the product is kept cold in the tank 10 . A transferring equipment 36 is adapted automatically to transfer the contents from the container 24 to the tank 10 when said temperature has been attained.
