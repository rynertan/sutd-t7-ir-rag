# Method and apparatus for controlled melt refining.

## Abstract
A controlled melt refining method is provided that ensures rapid and consistent refining by controlling the gas holdup ΔH H , as an index for the intensity of boiling, at a predetermined value in the range of 0.1 0.5. The method comprises a covering the surface of a semi killed molten steel in a ladle with a basic slag which either is non oxidizing or contains not more than 5 of FeO b maintaining the pressure of the atmosphere above the melt in the range of 30 150 Torr c blowing an inert gas into the ladle from the bottom and d maintaining the height of the boiling melt in terms of gas holdup ΔH H within the range of 0.1 0.5 by controlling the pressure at which the inert gas is blown and or by adjusting a vacuum exhaust valve, ΔH being the difference in height between the surface of the boiling melt and a quiet melt, and H being the height of the quite melt. The present invention also comprises an apparatus for refining molten steel in accordance with the above method.
