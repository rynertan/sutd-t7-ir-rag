# Apparatus and method for spreading fibres uniformly over a forming surface.

## Abstract
The invention relates to apparatus for spreading fibres uniformly over a forming surface, wherein a fibre distribu tor chamber 10 is furnished with an impeller 14 etc. to eject fibres onto the forming surface which comprises a foraminous conveyor 28 to create a fibrous, felted mat on the conveyor. The distributor has a fibre discharge opening provided with a foraminous screen through which the fi bres are ejected. To prevent anisotropy in the mat arising from the fi bres tending to align themselves with the direction of travel of the conveyor 28 , the discharge opening screen 12 is continuously movable across the said opening in the same direction as the conveyor 28 and at substantially the sa me speed. The fibres come to rest on the conveyor 28 randomly oriented and the resulting mat has substantially isotropic properties.
