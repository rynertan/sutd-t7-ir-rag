# Process for preparing polycyanoaryl ether powder.

## Abstract
A proces for preparing a polycyanoaryl ether powder which comprises reacting a dihalogenobenzonitrile with an alkali metal salt of at least one of hydroquinone and dihydroxydiphenyl in the presence of a solvent i to effect polycondensation reaction and adding to a resulting reac tion mixture a solvent ii which does not dissolve the resulting polymer but has compatibility with the solvent i when the concentration of the resulting polymer dissolved in the reaction mixture reaches to the range of from 2 to 15 by weight. According to the process, fine divided polycyanoaryl ether powders can be obtained without any mechanical grinding of the resulting polymers.
