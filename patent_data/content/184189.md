## Abstract
A film 1 of crystal crystal phase transformation type optical recording alloy is formed on an insulating substrate 11 . Information is written into or erased from the alloy film by heating it with an expedient other than a laser beam. Information is read by sensing reflected light of light projected on the alloy film.
