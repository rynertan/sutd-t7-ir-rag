## Description
A pipe connection comprising two metal outer pipes.the invention relates to a pipe connection comprising two metal outer pipes interconnected in a tensile resistant manner, a sealing member inter acting with said outer pipes and a first outer pipe being provided with a socket end.A pipe connection of two metal outer pipes interconnected by means of flanges, is known in the art.Pipe conduits comprising such connections present, especially in mining operations, a considerable amount of wear and corrosion, on the inner side of the metal outer pipes. Ihe present invention aims to provide a pipe connection of the aforementioned type in which said disadvantages do not arise.This object is attained in accordance with the invention in that a first plastic pipe with a plastic socket end is provided in the first metal outer pipe with socket end, the other metal outer pipe also enclosing another plastic pipe, an end portion of same prs truding beyond the front end of said outer metal outer pipe and being accommodated in said plastic socket end, a ring of rigid material sealingly cooperating with the inner side of the plastic socket end of the plastic pipe and with the outer side of the said end portion, by means of sealing rings.A connection of this type is extremely suitable for applying a corrosion and wear resistant coating in existing metal conduits.The first and other plastic pipe are advantageously installed in the metal outer pipes with some clearance whereupon said plastic pipes are pressed against the inner wall of the metal outer pipes by means of an internal fluid pressure. This facilitates applying the plastic pipe in the metal outer pipes.The invention will be illustrated with respect to an embodiment as shown in the drawing, wherein Fig. 1 is a view of a pipe connection according to the present invention, and Fig. 2 is a view similar the pipe connection of fig. 1, the plastic pipes however having been pressed against the inner wall of the metal outer pipes with the aid of an internal fluid pressure.Fig. 1 is a pipe connection according to the invention, comprising a first metal outer pipe 1 and a second metal outer pipe 2, the front ends 19, 20 respectively of the metal outer pipes being at a small distance from each other.The first metal outer pipe 1 comprises a socket end 8 and an end flange 3, having a first front flange surface 6, which front end surface comprises an annular space, in which a sealing ring 5 is accoommodated. Said sealing ring 5 sealingly co operates with a flange surface 7 of another metal flange 4 at the front end of the other or second metal outer pipe 2.The second metal outer pipe 2 furster comprises a connecting flange 17.The outer pipes are interconnected in a tensile resistant manner by means of bolts 18 engaging connecting flange 17 and end flange 3. To avoid any disadvantageous effect to the inner side of the metal outer pipes 1 and 2, by corrosion and or wear, respectively, a second plastic pipe 12 is installed with clearance in the second outer pipe 2. Said plastic pipe 12 comprises an end part 11 which projects beyond the front end 19 of the outer pipe 2, into the plastic socket end 10 of a first plastic pipe 9 being accommodated with clearance in the first metal outer pipe 1. The outer side of the plastic socket end 10, however, of the first plastic pipe 9 adjoins the inner side of the socket end 8 of the first metal outer pipe 1. Io sealingly interconnect the first plastic pipe 9 and the second plastic pipe 12, a rigid plastic ring 13 is provided comprising an outer chamber 15 and an inner chamber 14 in which sealing rings 16 are accommodated.Through the interaction of a sealing ring 16 with the outer side of end part 11 and with the inner side of plastic socket end 10, an optimum seal is obtained. Ihe rigid ring 13 advantageously consists of polyvinylchloride. Ihe first plastic pipe 9 and the second plastic pipe 11 consist e.g. also of polywinylchloride. Fig. 2 illustrates an embodiment corresponding to that of fig. 1, the plastic pipes 9 and 12, however, having been pressed against the inner side of the metal pipes by an internal fluid pressure.The inner and outer chambers 15 and 14 for accommodating sealing rings are preferably staggered with respect to each other so as to maintain the strength properties of the rigid ring 13.It is observed that the reference numerals in the claims are not intended to restrict the scope thereof, but are only denoted for clarification.
