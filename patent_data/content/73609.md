# Rotary screening machine.

## Abstract
In the recovery of paper making fiber from contaminated waste paper products including plastics film and other lightweight non paper contaminants, the waste paper products are processed together with liquid in a pulper tub 10 and contaminants and liquid are discharged through a junk outlet 33 in the tub and into a junk remover 30 . In order to induce flow of lightweight contaminants into the junk remover 30 , the latter has a weircontrolled discharge opening 40 adjacent its top, the level of the weir being regulated so as to maintain liquid flow over the weir. The liquid and lightweight contaminants entering the junk remover, as a result, flow upwardly to the weir and are discharged over the weir for subsequent processing and recirculation of paper stock to the pulper tub 10 . The materials flowing over the weir may be delivered to a rotary screening machine 50 which defibers the waste paper and separates the fibers from the lightweight contaminants. A novel rotary screening machine is provided for this purpose.
