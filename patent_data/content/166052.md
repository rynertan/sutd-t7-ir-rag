# Method and system for reconnecting inverter to rotating motors.

## Abstract
When an inverter is disconnected from a rotating motor due to power failure or motor accident, it is necessary to connect the inverter power again to the motor rotating by the inertia force in order to keep the motor rotating. To achieve the above reconnection, the inverter is controlled in accor dance with open loop control method, without use of any motor speed detecting means, thus improving control re sponse speed. In reconnection, the inverter is started at a frequency higher than the rotating motor speed and at a voltage lower than the rated value only the frequency is decreased gradually but increased gradually again when the detected motor driving current reaches zero or the motor regenerated current starts flowing and the voltage is raised when the detected motor regenerated current reach es its maximum value.
