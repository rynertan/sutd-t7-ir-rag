# Improvements in cutting devices for tiles.

## Abstract
A tile cutter for separating into parts a ceramic tile or the like after scoring a break line, comprised of a pair of blocks 110, 112 hinged by stop hinges 114 and having proximate edge faces cut away to provide clearance for folding the blocks about the hinge. Slots 134 extend through the blocks and are normally coplanar to admit a tile so as to bridge the gap between the two blocks. A stop which may be adjustable towards and away from the hinge, governs the amount by which a tile can be introduced into the aligned slots 134 . Alternatively, the tile may be held in position through a cut out 136, 138 . A scale allows the amount of insertion to be measured. A scribing tool is used to scribe a line in the tile surface to define the break line and the tile is cut or broken by sharply hinging one of the two blocks relative to the other as by a sharp impact, so as to stress the tile along the tile scribed line to cut break the tile therealong.
