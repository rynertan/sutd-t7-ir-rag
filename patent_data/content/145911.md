# Dry process for forming positive tone micro patterns.

## Abstract
A positive tone micro pattern is formed by a dry process in which a substrate is first coated with an organic polymer film and then with a film of an oxygen etch barrier. The oxygen etch barrier film is exposed to a low energy proton beam in a patternwise manner, and the pattern is developed by means of oxygen reactive ion etching.
