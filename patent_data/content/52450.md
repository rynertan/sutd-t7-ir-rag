# Method of manufacturing a semiconductor device with polycrystalline semiconductor cum metal electrodes.

## Abstract
An integrated circuit comprising at least one bipolar transistor I and at least one MIS FET II in a single semiconductor substrate 1 has an electrode for each region 2, 16, 31 of the bipolar transistor and each region 17, 18 of the MIS FET, which electrode comprises a polycrystalline semiconductor layer 28 and a metal layer 34 42 and has the same conduction type as the corresponding region and is connected by ohmic contact with the surface of the corres ponding region. The method involves forming a polycrystalline semicon ductor layer both over the emitter window of the bipolar transistor and on the gate insulating film 20 of the MIS FET, thus protecting the latter during the diffusion process used to from the emitter 31 .
