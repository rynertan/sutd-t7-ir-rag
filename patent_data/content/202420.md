The liquid phase reaction of mercaptans with sulfur as the oxidizing agent using alkali or amine catalysts is reported in U.S. Patent 3,314,999 U.S. Patent 3,755,461. In the above method, it is first necessary to manufacture and isolate the mercaptan before oxidizing it with sulfur to the corresponding disulfide. Processes for the manufacture of mercaptans from alcohols and hydrogen sulfide, according to equation 5 , where R is alkylEMI3.1 or aryl, are known and shown, for example, in U.S. Patent 3,035,097. STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION This invention is a method for manufacturing di Cl Cl2 alkyl disulfides in a continuous process comprising continuously reacting a Cl Cl2 alkyl alcohol and hydrogen sulfide in a molar ratio of 1 2 to 1 20 in contact with a solid, particulate catalyst in a first reaction zone at a temperature ranging from about 1000C to about 5000C and then continuously passing the crude mercaptan product of the reaction and molten sulfur at a molar ratio of from 1 0.05 to 1 2 in contact with a solid, particular catalyst in a second reaction zone at a temperature ranging from about 1250C to about 4000C, and recovering di Cl Cl2 alkyl disulfide. DISCUSSION OF THE INVENTION A method of manufacturing dialkyl disulfides in a continuous, two reactor process, using solid particulate catalysts in each reactor, has been found which process possesses an improved selectivity for the formation of dialkyl disulfides from alkyl alcohols, hydrogen sulfide, and sulfur. One advantage of this process over prior art processes is that it produces dialkyl disulfides from alkyl alcohols, rather than alkyl mercaptans, as a raw material, resulting in a substantial cost savings. Another advantage of this process is that the dialkyl disulfides can be manufactured with very little formation of unwanted byproduct dialkyl sulfides or carbon disulfide. Still another advantage is that the dialkyl polysulfides, which are formed as byproducts in this process, can be totally recycled to the second reactor where they react with the intermediate alkyl mercaptan to form additional dialkyl disulfide. Still another advantage is that high dialkyl disulfide production rates can be sustained for long periods of time without the necessity for periodic air regeneration of the catalyst to remove coke and tars. The Cl Cl2 alkyl alcohols used in the process of this invention include, for example, methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, pentanol, hexanol, heptanol, octanol, decanol, dodecanol and isomeric forms of these normal alcohols.Preferably, the C1 C6 alkyl alcohols are used in the process, more preferably the C1 C4 alkanols and most preferably, methanol. Any of a variety of solid, particulate catalysts, preferably aluminum containing catalysts, are used in both of the reaction zones of the process of this invention.Alumina, silica, thoria, or alumina promoted with an alkali metal tungstate or alumina promoted with an alkali metal heteropoly acid salt, such as potassium phosphotungstate, can be used to convert the C1 to C12 alkyl alcohol to C1 to C12 alkyl mercaptan. The catalysts described at column 2, line 43 through a column 4, line 24 of U.S. Patent No. 3,035,097 are some of the catalysts suitable for this invention and this portion of the 097 patent is incorporated herein by reference. The aluminum containing catalysts of the second seaction zone, are preferably synthetic aluminosilicates haracterized by high uniformity, well defined pore size, large surface area, and complete crystallinity. The structures of the zeolite catalysts are described in UnionCarbide s booklet F 08 entitled Zeolite MolecularSieve Catalysts and D. W. Breck, Zeolite Molecular Sieves, 1974 , John Wiley Sons, New York. Various types of zeolite catalysts are manufactured, for example, by Akzo Chemie, Air Products Houdry , Norton, PQ Corporation, UnitedCatalysts, and Union Carbide. The basic unit of the synthetic zeolites is composed of silicon and aluminum atoms tetrahedrally coordinated with four oxygen atoms. Since the aluminum atoms are trivalent, they have a net negative charge when bonded with 4 oxygen atoms A104 . This charge is balanced by a cation, such asNa , K , or H in the as synthesized zeolites. These cations can be exchanged with other metals or cations. For example, a divalent cation such as cobalt will replace 2 univalent cations, while a trivalent cation such as chromium, lanthanum, or cerium will replace 3 univalent cations. It is thus possible to replace the alkali metal cations, Na or K , with catalytically more active cations such as Ag l, Co 2,Ni 2, Mo 2 or 3 , Fe 2 or 3 , Cr 3, La 3, etc., if desired. However, the alkali metal cations are preferred for this invention with the catalyst typically containing about 13 percent by weight of the alkali metal, expressed as the alkali metal oxide eg., Na2O, K2O . Although many factors influence the catalytic activity of these zeolites, the three most important are, 1 the open framework structure with its attendant pore size, 2 theSiO2 A1203 ratio of the framework, and 3 the cations. As in most catalytic processes, the large pore zeolites having pore openings in the range of 7 to 10 Angstroms are most useful.The most preferred are Type X, Type Y, and Type L zeolites. Type X has a chemical composition expressed in terms of oxide ratios of Na20 A1203 2 3SiO2 with a typical unit cell composition in the hydrated state of Na86 A102 86 SiO2 106 264 H2O. Type Y, on the other hand, has a composition of Na2O A1203 3 6 SiO2. When the SiO2 A1203 molar ratio is 4.8, the hydrated unit cell composition is Na56 A102 56 SiO2 136 264 H20. Type L, more siliceous then Type X and Type Y, also has a pore size in the 7 to 10Angstrom range. An important building block of these zeolites is the sodalite cage, a truncated octahedron unit consisting of 24 SiO4,A104 units. In Type X and Type Y zeolites, the sodalite cages are connected through 4 of the 8 hexagonal faces in a tetrahedral arrangement. The pores thus created are defined by a 12 member ring of oxygen atoms, approximately 7 to 9 Angstroms in size, opening into a central cavity of about 11 Angstroms in diameter. The more preferred synthetic zeolites are Types X and Y because of their larger pore sizes. The ability of the TypeY to withstand higher temperatures without losing its crystalline structure makes it the most preferred zeolite catalyst for the second reaction zone of this invention. The zeolites, as prepared, generally contain as the cation about 13 percent by weight sodium as Na20 or equivalent amount of other alkali metal as Me2O . As explained above, this cation may be replaced with other cations to reduce the sodium content. In this invention, however, the most preferred catalyst contains sodium as the cation, with a sodium content of at least 3 percent, preferably more than 5 percent, more preferably greater than 10 percent, and most preferably at the 13 percent by weight as Na2O level. THE DRAWING An example of the process of this invention is depicted in the drawing which is a flow diagram for the manufacture of dialkyl disulfide represented by dimethyl disulfide DMDS .Methanol and hydrogen sulfide are fed continuously in a molar ratio ranging from about 1 2 to 1 20, preferably from 1 6 to 1 10 to a first reactor 2, the excess hydrogen sulfide being used to depress the formation of byproduct dimethyl sulfide.The reactants are heated and vaporized in preheaters 4 and 6, mixed, and charged to reactor 2 wherein the reaction takes place in the presence of a solid, particulate catalyst, eg., alumina with or without potassium phosphotungstate promoter, at a pressure ranging between atmospheric and 500 psig, preferably between about 100 and 400 psig, and at a temperature ranging from about 100 to about 5000C, preferably from about 250 to about 4000C. The reaction temperature is determined by the catalyst bed temperature. The molar velocity of the alcohol may vary over a wide range but will usually be between about 50 and 500, preferably between about 100 and 150, gram moles of alcohol vapor per kilogram of catalyst per 24 hours at STP .The volume of the catalyst in the first reaction zone is adjusted to produce mercaptan at the desired rate for passage of the crude mercaptan to the second reaction zone. Most of the byproduct water is removed in the liquidphase water separator 8. A major portion of the hydrogen sulfide in the effluent from reactor 2 is separated from the effluent mixture in high pressure separator 10 and returned via line 12 to reactor 2. Crude mercaptan in the effluent stream passing from the bottom of separator 10 is preheated at 14 and forwarded through line 16 to the second reactor.Fresh sulfur is also introduced to the second reactor through preheater 18 via line 20. Molten sulfur is fed to second reactor 22 in a molar ratio that is preferably about 0.15 for each mole of mercaptan which provides less sulfur than is required to meet the stoichiometric requirement for the equation EMI9.1 This sulfur deficiency minimizes polysulfide formation. The preheated reactants are mixed, at point I, and charged to the reactor 22 wherein they are subjected to elevated temperatures in the range of 125 to 250 C and pressures from atmospheric to about 600 psig in the presence of a particulate catalyst, preferably a Type X or Y zeolite, to effect reaction. Under the stated conditions, the crude methyl mercaptan is in the vapor phase and the elemental sulfur is in the liquid phase. Any unreacted sulfur is separated in a knock out pot 24 from the crude product issuing from the bottom of reactor 22.After sulfur separation, the crude product is passed into a series of distillation columns or towers . The first column 26 removes the low boilers largely unreacted methyl mercaptan and H2S through the overhead stream 28 and recycles them back to the reactor 2 or, alternatively, reactor 22. The bottoms stream is then passed via line 30 to the second distillation tower 32 where the heavies, mostly polysulfides, are taken as bottoms and recycled through heater 36 back to second reactor 22 to react with the mercaptan to form more disulfide e.g., CH3SSSCH3 2 CH3SH EMI10.1 2CH3SSCH3 H2S . The remaining low boilers, e.g., minor amounts of dimethyl sulfide and carbon disulfide, and the product, DMDS, are taken as an overhead and passed to the third tower 38.The high purity product DMDS, is taken off from tower 38 as a bottoms material, while the low boilers are taken overhead through line 40 for recycle back to the first reactor 2. Operable conditions for the desired reaction to occur in the reactor 22 are the presence of a solid, particulate catalyst, a catalyst bed temperature in the range 125 4000C, and pressures ranging from atmospheric to 600 psig.The molar ratio of fresh sulfur and crude alkyl mercaptan from reactor 2 fed to the second reactor 22 may range from a 2 to 1 molar excess of sulfur over alkyl mercaptan to a 20 to 1 molar excess of alkyl mercaptan over sulfur. The molar ratios in the combined fresh plus recycle feed to the reactor 22 may, of course, be outside this range and will usually contain a substantial molar excess of alkyl mercaptan over sulfur, which may be as high as 20 to 1, to avoid excess polysulfide formation. The feed to the reactor 22 may also contain up to 50 percent by volume of an inert gas or mixture of inert cooling gases to provide sufficient heat removal from the catalyst zone. The inert gases may be nitrogen, methane, ethane, propane, butane, carbon dioxide, or any other gas that does not interfere with the reactions to produce the desired dialkyl disulfide. The rate at which the crude alkyl mercaptan is passed over the catalyst may range from about 100 to about 2000 gram moles of alkyl mercaptan per kilogram of catalyst per 24 hours, or expressed in different units, from 100 to about 2000 pound moles per 1000 pounds of catalyst per 24 hour day. The preferred catalyst bed temperatures catalyst bed temperature equals reaction temperature in reactor 22 are in the range 125 2250C, and the preferred pressures are in the range 50 375 psig. The preferred molar ratio of crude alkyl mercaptan to sulfur fed into reactor 22 is in the range 20 1 to 1 1, and is most preferably near the molar ratio of about 7 1. The preferred rate at which the crude alkyl mercaptan is passed over the catalyst is in the range 750 1250 gram moles of alkyl mercaptan per kilogram of catalyst per 24 hours. The preferred catalyst is a Type Y zeolite having a sodium content of about 13 by weight, expressed as Na20. The following examples omit the first phase reaction of this process wherein methyl mercaptan is produced substantially in accordance with the process disclosed inU.S. 3,035,097 from methyl alcohol and hydrogen sulfide.Instead, a simulated crude product of the first phase reaction consisting of methyl mercaptan and hydrogen sulfide is fed to the second stage reactor along with sulfur with and without recycle polysulfides in the prescribed molar ratio. In the example, 14 runs are made to demonstrate the process of this invention using a Type Y zeolite catalyst containing 13 weight percent sodium expressed as Na2O. The composition of the crude product, sampled at point II of the flow diagram of the Drawing, is determined by gas chromatographic GC analysis. The material balances across reactor 22, and the single pass conversions of the crude methyl mercaptan to DMDS are calculated from the GC data. EXAMPLE 1 To simulate a fresh plus recycle feed mixture of the process, as indicated at point I of the flow diagram of theDrawing, when all byproduct dimethyl polysulfides are recycled, methyl mercaptan, H2S, sulfur, and an approximately 80 20 by weight mixture of dimethyl trisulfide and dimethyl tetrasulfide, were pumped separately, as liquids, at appropriate rates to provide a continuous CH3SH H2S S bMS x mixture in the desired molar ratios from 1 0.5 0.15 0.04 to 1 0.5 0.15 0.09. The above reaction components were passed individually through stainless steel packed tubes installed in an electrically heated preheater maintained at 200 2250C. The liquid polysulfides 80 20 mix were blended with the vaporized gases in a static mixer before entering the reactor tube. The molten sulfur was then injected into the gas stream at the top of the reactor tube. The reactor is a 316 stainless steel tube, 2 inches in diameter i.d. , and 36 inches in length, enclosed in an electrically heated vertical furnace. The catalyst is a Type Y zeolite containing 13 by weight sodium, expressed as Na20, in the form of a 1 8 inch extrudate sold by Union Carbide under a product designation LZ Y52.It is arranged in a 6 9 inch fixed bed located centrally within the vertical reactor tube and maintained in the temperature range of 145 165 C. The exit stream was passed as a vapor into a stainless steel vessel maintained at 165 CC to separate unreacted sulfur from the crude product stream. The effluent was then cooled by passing the crude product through a coil immersed in a cooling bath maintained at minus 50C, such temperature being sufficient to completely liquify the crude reactor effluent.The liquified stream was then passed directly into a gas chromatograph for analysis. The stream was visually inspected to confirm complete liquification, passed through a back pressure control release valve and then into a closed end vessel maintained at minus 500C. The pressure in the reactor system was kept between 325 and 340 psig, and the methyl mercaptan molar velocity was maintained at about 1000 gram moles of CH3SH per kilogram of catalyst per 24 hours. Two series of seven continuous runs 1 14 , of approximately 12 hours duration each, were made using theUnion Carbide LZ Y52 sodium zeolite catalyst. The reaction conditions and production rates of the products are given inTable 1 for each run. A series of GC analyses of the effluent were made at point II of the Drawing during each run and averaged to obtain the production figures shown for each run. Other runs using the above described zeolite catalyst and varying process conditions are shown in Table 2 Runs 15 23 and Table 3 Runs 24 40 . Overall yields of DMDS, based on methanol, are calculated to be over 90 for this two reactor process, with recycling, as illustrated in the Drawing, when operating at preferred conditions. For the Type Y zeolite catalyst of high sodium content,Tables 1, 2, and 3 distinctly show the effect of operating conditions on the rate of product formation. In Table 1, the effect of the sulfur to methyl mercaptan ratio is clearly shown. On reducing the sulfur to mercaptan molar ratio to 0.2 1 or lower, no CS2 by product is produced. The conversion of methyl mercaptan to DMDS is calculated as the moles of DMDS produced times 2 divided by the moles of CH3SH fed. As shown in Table 1, 19 to 32 percent of the methyl mercaptan fed is converted in a single pass to DMDS, with no yield losses to dimethyl sulfide or CS2.Although some of the conversions of methyl mercaptan to DMDS shown in Tables 2 and 3 are nearly equal to those shown in Table 1, the high production rate of byproduct CS2, and the presence of dimethyl sulfide, shown in Tables 2 and 3, make the conditions employed less desirable. EXAMPLE 2 Example 1 is repeated, except that the catalyst used isUnion Carbide s LZ Y62 protonated zeolite about 2.5 sodium expressed as Na20 and, except for the high H2S levels used, the operating conditions are comparable to those in Tables 2 and 3. The high H2S for each run was needed to reduce coke formation. In run 44, the conversion reached the level of single pass conversion 22 observed with the LZ Y52 catalyst, but the production levels of the undesirable byproducts CS2 and dimethyl sulfide, increased to an unacceptable level. The catalyst was found to contain coke and tars on removal from the reactor. The results of runs 41 44 of this example are reported inTable 4. EXAMPLE 3 Example 1 is repeated, except that the catalyst is a commercial alumina Alcoa F l doped with 5 potassium hydroxide, based on the weight of the alumina, prepared by dissolving the KOH in water just sufficient to wet the catalyst, followed by oven drying. The operating conditions are comparable to those in Tables 2 and 3, and, in run 46, the level of single pass conversion of methyl mercaptan toDMDS 30 was equal to that observed during the runs ofExample 1. The results of runs 45 48 of this example are reported in Table 5. TABLE 1 EXAMPLE 1 EMI17.1 Catalyst SEP CH3SH SEP H2S SEP Sulfur SEP Inerts SEP Bottoms SEP Gms. SEP Gm. SEP Gm.
