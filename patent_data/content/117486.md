# METHOD FOR GROWTH AND PURIFICATION OF HUMAN CELL LINES FROM HETEROGENEOUS CELL POPULATIONS IN TISSUE CULTURE

## Abstract
Human melanocyte cells are grown in tissue culture medi um containing fibroblast growth suppressor plus tumor growth promoters at pH 7.2 to about 7.4. In a stepwise procedure, Langerhans, keratinocytes and most fibroblasts are removed in the presence of the above suppressor and promoter fol lowed by a subsequent trypsinization treatment. In a final puri fication step, remaining fibroblasts are separated from the melanocytes by reacting the cell mixture with monoclonal an tibody specific for melanocytes, and then separating out the melanocytes from the fibroblasts on density gradients.
