## Description
Method and aJBparstus for transferring a layer of mineral woo from one QonveThQr to another. The present invention relates to a method and an appratus for transferring of a layer of mineral wool from one conveyor to another, whereby fibres of mineral wool from a spinning chamber are continuously collected on a first conveyor, from which the fibres are to be transferred to a second conveyor for subsequent treatment of the mineral wool.The object of the invention is to collect all or substantially all mineral wool which after the fibres are formed are collected on the first conveyor and thereby at the same time clean the said conveyor which is generally perforated or otherwise formed with through holes. When manufacturing mineral wool mineralic raw materials are first melted. As melt equipments can be used shaft furnaces, tank furnaces, electronic furnaces etc. For each type of melted raw material there is generally one or a few melt apparatus which give a technically economically acceptable function. For other compositions of melted raw material and for other operation conditions other melt apparatus may be used.When manufacturing mineral wool the melted raw material is allowed to continuously flow along to one or several fibrating apparatus, in which the melted raw material is broken into fibres or granules. Also the fibrating apparatus may be of many different types, but for each particular case the choice of suitable fibrating methods and fibrating apparatus, however, is rather restricted. Among fibrating apparatus for manufacture of mineral wool such apparatus are most common which utilize rotatable bodies in combination with gas flows. An often used apparatus for the manufacture of mineral wool comprises a shaft furnace heated with coke as the maiii fuel. The shaft furnace is charged with a mixture of stone and coke and in the shaft furnace the stene is melted by means of the heat developed by the coke when a flow of blast air is injected at the lower part of the furnace.The melted material continuously flows out through an outlet opening at the lower part of the furnace. Over a system of melt pipes the melted material is thereafter fed to a fibrating apparatus comprising between two and four so called spinning wheels, each of which is rotatable mounted on a horisontal shaft, whereby the shafts are provided on substantially the same vertical level. The spinning wheels are provided so that the melted material first meets one spinning wheel and is thereafter thrown over to the second wheel and so on to any subsequent spinning wheels. From the spinning wheels the melted material leaves in the form of a large number of threads which are transformed to fibres both depending on the centrifugal force and also by the action of an air flow from an air slot which more or less completely surrounds the spinning wheels.By the action of the air flow the fibres thereby formed are thrown away from the fibrating apparatus and into a so called spinning chamber. By an air or gas flow the fibres and flocks of mineral wool are transferred to a perforated conveyor provided in connection to the spinning chamber and to which a suction chamber is connected. The suction chamber is mounted at the lower side of the conveyor, and the fibres are separated from the gas or air flow and are kept at the conveyor so that a layer of mineral wool is formed. The layer of mineral wool thereby formed later has to be transferred to and received by a second conveyor adapted to move the mineral wool away for further treatment, for instance to a hardening furnace.When the layer of mineral wool is transferred from the delivering first conveyor to the receiving second conveyor some fibres and flocks of mineral wool generally are left at the delivering co nveyor. Previously the said remaining portion of the mineral wool used to be more or less continuously removed from the delivering conveyor for instance by means of brush rollers, and the material was removed as waste material. It is of importance that the delivering perforated conveyor is effectively cleaned so that no fibres or flocks of mineral wool remain on the conveyor and block the perforated holes since this may lead to unneccessary operation stops in that it may be necessary to stop and clean the conveor. In addition the fibre material removed from the conveyor in the said way completely gets lost what leads to unnecessary losses of material. Basis of the invention therefore is the problem to provide a method and an apparatus or transferring the said remaining fibres and flocks of mineral wool to receiving conveyor. The said problem is solved in a simple way by the method and apparatus according to the invention in that at least one intermediate conveyor is provided between the delivering conveyor and the receiving conveyor apparatus. The intermediate conveyor is placed in relation to the delivering and the receiving conveyor so that the main portion of the layer of mineral wool is received by the intermediate conveyor from a point of the delivering conveyor called the delivering point, and the said portion of the mineral layer is delivered at a point of the receiving conveyor called the receiving point.Between the two points a cleaning apparatus, for instance a brush cleaning apparatus is provided which removes fibres and pellets of mineral wool which stick to the perforated conveyor after the main portion of the layer of mineral wool is received by the intermediate conveyor. The said fibres and pellets of mineral wool are thrown upwards and away from the perforated conveyor by the cleaning apparatus and so that they fall down on the receiving conveyor in front of the receiving point. Further characteristics of the invention will be evident from the following detailed specification in which reference will be made to the accompanying drawing. In the drawing is illustrated a preferred embodiment of an apparatus for executing the method according to the invention In the drawing is illustrated how fibres 1 drop down through a spinning chamber 2 and are deposited on the conveyor 3 to form a layer or path of mineral wool 4. The conveyor 3 which is perforated is formed as an endless band extending over sets of drive rollers and support rollers 5, 6, 7 and 8. Between he sets of rollers 5 and 6 there is a suction chamber 9 by means of which the transport air of the spinning chamber 2 is drained and the fibres and wool flocks 1 deposit on the conveyor 3 to form the layer 4 of mineral wool.Above the support roller 6 there is an apparatus 10 intended to form a seal together with the mineral wool layer 4 between the spinning chamber 2 and the ambient air outside the spinning chamber so that no ambient air is drawn into the spinning chamber 2. From the conveyor 3 the mineral wall layer 4 is transferred to an intermediate conveyor 11, which is carried by a drive roller 12 and a support roller 13. The layer 4 of mineral wool is thereafter moved on to a receiving conveyor 14 carried by a drive roller 15 and a support roller 16. From the receiving conveyor 14 the layer 4 of mineral wool is moved to an apparatus for subsequent treatment, for instance a hardening furnace. One end of the intermediate conveyor 11 is located relatively close the point where the layer 4 of mineral wool leaves the spinning chamber 2, and the opposite end of the intermediate conveyor 11 is located adjacent the receiving conveyor 14. At a delivering point 17 of the delivering conveyor 3 the main portion of the layer 4 of mineral wool is moved over to the intermediate conveyor 11, and at a receiving point 18 of the receiving conveyor 14 the path of mineral wool is deposited on the receiving conveyor 14. Between the delivering point 17 and the receiving point 18a cleaning apparatus 19 is provided which cleans the delivering conveyor 3 at the same time as it transfers those fibres and wool flocks 20 which have remained on the conveyor 3 after the mineral wool path 4 was transferred to the intermediate conveyor 11 at the delivering point 17. The said fibres and wool flocks 20 are transferred to the receiving conveyor 14 and they are brought to and combined with the bottom portion of the mineral wool path at the receiving point 18. By means of the cleaning apparatus 19 it is possible to collect to nearly 100 those fibres and wool flocks 20 which are present on the conveyor 3 in that the fibres and flocks which are removed from the conveyor 3 and are transferred to the conveyor 14 are combined and united with the main portion of the mineral wool path 4 at the receiving point 18. At the same time the conveyor 3 is cleaned so that no additional cleaning apparatus for the conveyor is needed. The cleaning apparatus 19 can be provided in different ways. It may for instance comprise a cleaning brush roller 21 which rotates rapidly and contacts the conveyor band 3. In addition thereto a supportinc brush roller 22 may be mounted at the opposite side of the conveyor bard 3 opposite to the cleaning roller 21, in other words at the inside of the conveyor 3. The said supporting brush roller 22 preferably should be provided so as to press against the conveyor band and has the same peripheral speed as the conveyor band, whereby the bristles enter and penetrate the perforations what makes the cleaning of the conveyor very effective.Further the above described cleaning apparatus may be com pleted by an air ramp 23 which from inside blows air through the perforations adjacent the feeding end or the intermediate conveyor 11 and which facilitates the releasing and the transferring of the main portion of the mineral wool path to the intermediate conveyor 11. In an alternative embodiment of the invention the cleaning apparatus 19 may consist only of an air ramp at the rear side of the conveyor band which ramp in a suitable way is directed to the conveyor band and gives such heavy air blow that the fibres and wool flocks 20 are both released from the conveyor 3 and forced out of the perforations and are also thrown away so as to deposit on the receiving conveyor 14. In the preceding specification the invention has only been described with reference to the embodiment thereof illustrated in the drawing, but it is to be understood that the invention can be varied and modified in many different ways within the scope of the appended claims. For instance the intermediate conveyor 11, 12, 13 can be substituted by two or several conveyors. It is also possible to form the cleaning apparatus at one or several cleaning devices provided on top of each other. The endless delivering conveyor 3 which in the illustrated embodiment is carried by four support rollers of course can be provided supported by two, three or any larger number of support rollers.
