# A device and a method for recovering heat from the soil.

## Abstract
A device and method for recovering heat from the soil and groundwater, comprising heat exchanging means con sisting of an inner tube 2,44b and an outer tube 1,44a and partitions 16,44c forming longitudinal channels 17,51a between said inner and outer tube. An inlet 7,32,47 for heat exchanging fluid and an outlet for heat exchanging fluid 9,33,49 are present for conveying a heat exchanging fluid through the channels 17,51a . The heat exchanging means are preferably placed in a perforated casing 35 allowing passage of liquid but not of soil particles. The casing consists preferably of an outer casing tube 38 and an inner casing tube 39 , casing partitions 40 providing longitudinal casing channels 51 . For allowing passage of groundwater the outer casing tube 38 and the inner casing tube are provided with perforations 41,42 . Heat is recovered by passing a heat exchanging fluid through the casing channels 51 .
