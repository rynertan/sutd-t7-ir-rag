## Description
HYBRID CELL LINES PRODUCING MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES DIRECTED AGAINST TRICHOMONAS VAGINAL IS DETERMINANTS The present invention relates to monoclonal antibodies specific for Trichomonas vaginalis. More specifically, this invention relates to hybridomas which produce monoclonal antibodies specific for T. vaginalis antigenic determinants and their use in a diagnostic assay. Trichomoniasis is a chronic disease of the urogenital tract caused by Trichomonas vaginalis. It is the most common of all sexually transmitted diseases and is responsible for a significant economic and emotional burden among infected individuals in this country and the world. In women, trichomonal vaginitis is characterized by inflammation of vaginal epithelium, foul smelling discharge, and tissue cytopathology. Most men are asymptomatic, and the clinical picture of this disease remains controversial. Disease manifestations such as urethritis, prostatitis, balanoposthitis, and others, however, have been documented in infected men. Current clinical diagnosis of trichomoniasis is tedious, time consuming, highly inadequate, and based on microscopic detection of the parasite. These limitations in diagnosis exacerbate already limited medical care in rural health clinics in our country and the world. Thus, basic research is necessary to address relevant issues such as development of sensitive, accurate assays for screening of symptomatic as well as asymptomatic patients and perhaps monitoring disease progression. The development of strategies to identify potential vaccinogen candidates is equally important and necessary. Further, the emergence of trichomoniasis as a major sexually transmitted disease, therefore, has necessitated the need for research directed toward identification of possible virulence factors. The characterization of the surface of T. vaginalis has not been accomplished.Furthermore, the use of conventional immunological methods has failed to identify specific virulence determinants or antigens. It therefore is highly desirable to provide monoclonal antibody to T. vaginalis antigens. Such antibodies would be important in the differential diagnosis of trichomoniasis disease in humans, in the purification of specific immunogens for subsequent use as vaccines, and studying the structure and function of immunogenic components of virulent T. vaginalis. Antibodies are normally synthesized by lymphoid cells derived from B lymphocytes of bone marrow. The great diversity of antibody specificities is accomplished by immunoglobulin molecules having many structural features in common. Individual antibody molecules of heterogeneous binding specificity differ in their detailed amino acid sequences and even antibodies of the same specificity are usually a mixture of immunoglobulins having different amino acid sequences, although such sequences may be substantially homologous. The terms antibody and immunoglobulin are used interchangeably herein. Individual lymphocytes produce immunoglobulin of a single amino acid sequence. Lymphocytes cannot be directly cultured to produce their specific antibody.However, Kohler, et al, Nature 256 495 1975 demonstrated that a process of somatic cell fusion, specifically between a lymphocyte and a myeloma cell, could yield hybrid cells which grow in culture and produce a specific antibody. Myeloma cells are lymphocyte tumor cells which, depending upon the cell strain, frequently produce an antibody themselves, moreover some non producing strains are known. The hybrid resulting from somatic fusion of a lymphocyte and a myeloma cell is termed a hybridoma cell herein and in the art generally. In a typical fusion procedure, spleen lymphocytes from an animal immunized against a chosen antigen are fused with myeloma cells.The resulting hybridomas are then dispersed in a series of separate culture tubes or microtiter plate wells to screen for cultures producing a desired antibody. Positive cultures are further diluted to obtain colonies arising from a single cell clones . The clones are again screened for production of the desired antibody. Antibody produced by a cloned hybridoma is termed monoclonal herein and in the art. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigen only. Furthermore, in contrast to conventional antibody preparations which typically include different antibodies directed against different sets of determinants on the same antigen, monoclonal antibodies are directed only against a single determinant on the antigen. Monoclonal antibodies are useful to improve the selectivity and specificity of diagnostic and analytical assay methods using antigenantibody binding. A second advantage of monoclonal antibodies is provided by the fact that they are synthesized in pure form by the hybridoma culture, uncontaminated by other immunoglobulins. Monoclonal antibodies may be prepared from supernatants of cultured hybridoma cells or from ascites induced by intraperitoneal inoculation of hybridoma cells into mice. In accordance with the present invention, continuous hybridoma cell lines are established which elaborate and secrete highly specific and homogenous monoclonal antibodies to various antigens of Trichomonas vaginalis organisms. Specifically, hybridoma cell lines are produced which secrete monoclonal antibodies having specificity for T. vaginalis membrane protein antigens cell surface exposed protein antigens and certain membrane protein antigens having apparent molecular weights of 270,000 230,000 65,000 or 35,000. Of the 34 hybrid clones screened which exhibited monoclonal antibodies specific for T. vaginalis, 8 hybrid lines were deposited with the American Type CultureCollection in Rockville, Maryland hybrid cell 5bB6,C20 A3 ATCC code HB8379 , cell F2FE10 12 Code HB8380 , cell 5bB6, C24 24 Code HB8381 , Cell 5bB6,C24 23 Code HB8382 , cell DM9 Code HB8383 , Cell DM92 Code HB8384 , cell F2FElO C55 Code HB8385 , and cellDM86 Code HB8386 . Further, the monoclonal antibodies according to this invention provide diagnostic reagent, useful in immunological assays for trichomoniasis infection. The following discussion is in terms of the preferred embodiments of this invention, which represents the best mode known to the Applicant at the time of this application. In accordance with the processes to develop the hybrid cell lines and monoclonal antibodies of this invention, test animals are stimulated for antibody production by different immunization regimens and using different antigen preparations of Trichomonas vaginalis pathogenic to humans as outlined below. For example, immunization of test animals was performed following subcutaneous inoculation of live organisms in the hind quarters of BALB c mice or via intraperitoneal injection of either membrane material or protein acrylamide preparations following gel electrophoresis of total protein representative of T. vaginalis and cutting of important acrylamide fractions for immunization. In all cases,Applicant has directed the preferred embodiment to immunization of mice with a heterogeneous composition of parasite materials, thereby providing a complex array of antigenic determinants. The route and schedule of immunization of the host animal is in keeping with established and conventional techniques for antibody stimulation and production.Applicant has employed mice as a test model although it is contemplated that any mammalian subject, including human subjects or antibody producing cells therefrom, can be manipulated to serve as the basis for production of hybrid cell lines. After immunization, immune lymphoid cells are fused with myeloma, plasmacytoma, or hybridoma cells hereinafter referred to collectively as myeloma cells to generate a hybrid cell line which can be cultivated and subcultivated indefinitely, to produce large quantities of monoclonal antibodies. For purposes of this invention, the immune lymphoid cells selected for fusion are lymphocytes and their normal differentiated progeny, taken either from lymph node tissue or spleens tissue from immunized animals. Applicant prefers to employ immune spleen cells, since they offer a more concentrated and convenient source of antibody producing cells with respect to the mouse system.The myeloma cells provide the basis for continuous propagation of the fused hybrid. Myeloma cells are tumor cells derived from plasma cells which show preference for bone marrow. Plasmacytoma cells are neoplastic cells derived from plasma cells. In particular, Applicant prefers to use lymphocyte hybridoma cells which secrete no immunoglobulin. Lymphocyte hybridoma cells are cells generated by the fusion of myeloma or plasmacytoma cells with normal differentiated lymphoid cells. Myeloma, plasmacytoma, and hybridomas can be selected to be devoid of immunoglobulin synthesis. The particular species of animal from which the myeloma and immunized antibody producing cells are derived are not critical, in that it is possible to fuse cells of one species with another. However, it is preferred that the source of immunized antibody producing cells and myeloma be from the same species. Generally the fusion techniques employed are according to the procedures set out by Kohler et al, Eur. J.Immunol. 6 11 19 1976 and Kennett et al, LymphocyteHybridomas Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology 81 77 91 1978 Springer Verlag, New York. Fusion is generally accomplished by adding a suspension of antibody producing cells to the myeloma cells in growth medium and centrifuged to form a pellet. The fused hybrids are next screened for antibody production specific for T. vaginalis surface antigens.The membrane specific monoclonal antibodies obtained according to preferred examples include antibodies with individual specificity for the numerous antigenic components of the membrane, including lipids, glycoprotein and protein antigenic determinants. The hybridomas which secrete antibody specific for T.vaginalis membrane antigens are cultured to establish a continuous cell line with stable genetic coding. These cell lines can be stored and preserved in any of a number of conventional ways, including freezing and storage under liquid nitrogen. Frozen cell lines can be revived and cultured indefinitely with resumed synthesis and secretion of monoclonal antibodies specific for T. vaginalis antigen. The secreted antibody is recovered from tissue culture supernatant by conventional precipitation, ion exchange, affinity chromatography, or the like. The recovered antibody can be freeze dried and stored under refrigeration for at least several weeks without significant loss of activity. The following examples are offered to illustrate a particular embodiment of the invention but they are not intended to limit it.A. Preparation of Antigen The clinical isolate of T. vaginalis pathogenic to humans employed for generation of monoclonal antibodies crossreactive with long term grown and fresh isolates was strain 286, which has been previously described, Alderete,Infect. Immun. 39 1041 1047, 1983. Other strains used for the assaying of the monoclonal antibodies include a long term grown culture, strainJH31A, purchased from the American Type Culture Collection ATCC Rockeville, MD and fresh isolates obtained from Michael Spence, The Johns Hopkins University Baltimore,MD . Trichomonas vaginalis was grown in a Diamond trypticase BBL Microbiology Systems, Cockeysville, MD yeast extract maltose TYM medium, pH 6.2, supplemented with 10 heat inactivated horse serum Kansas City Biologicals,Inc., Lenexa, Kansas . Organisms routinely grew to a density of 2.5 x 10 to 5 x 10 per ml as determined with an improved Neubauer counting chamber. Only motile parasites at logarithmic stage of growth were utilized. Stock cultures of all T. vaginalis strains were stored in liquid nitrogen in TYM serum medium containing 10 dimethylsulfoxide DMSO ATCC .All strains remained virulent throughout these studies as evidenced by lesion development in mice after 9 12 days post subcutaneous inoculation. 1. Antigen used for immunization a. Preliminary studies Alderete, Infect.Immun. 39 1041 1047, 1983 indicated that subcutaneous infection of the hind quarters of BALB c mice produced antibody formation directed at highly immunogenic membrane proteins of T. vaginalis. For studies where spleen lymphocytes from animals challenged with live organisms were desired, the pathogenic trichomonads were grown to logarithmic phase representing 1 x 106. The organisms per ml parasites were then washed twice in sterile phosphatebuffered saline PBS and finally resuspended to a density of 5 x 106 per 0.5 ml volume in TYM serum with 0.05 agar.A second injection was performed as indicated in the next section with organisms in TYM serum medium followed by a third injection with T. vaginalis suspended in PBS. b. For immunization with protein acrylamide preparations, slab gel sodium dodecysulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis SDS PAGE of total trichloroacetic acid TCA precipitated proteins was performed using conditions and reagents previously described Peterson andAlderete, Infect. Immun. 37 755, 1982 Alderete, Infect.Immun. 39 1041, 1983 Alderete, Infect. Immun. 40 284, 1983 . Protein bands from one of the twenty lanes loaded with material were visualized by Coomassie Bulliant blue staining of acrylamide gels, and proteins with electrophoretic mobilities corresponding to 50,000 70,000 were excised. The gel was lyopholized, pulverized, resuspended in sterile distilled water, and this represented a protein acrylamide antigen preparation used for immunization as outlined below. Antigen from two electrophoretic runs on a 14 x 16 cm slab acrylamide gel of 0.75 mm in thickness provided sufficient material for immunization of two mice throughout the preferred regimen. The antigen gave a final volume of 3 ml when resuspended in distilled water, and 1 ml of this material was mixed with an equal volume of Freund s complete adjuvant while the remaining two ml were mixed with Freund s incomplete adjuvant. c. Crude plasma membranes of T. vaginalis were generated from 2 x 108 cells. The organisms were washed three times in PBS followed by resuspending the organisms in PBS containing 10 mM MgCl2 and 0.5 mg ml concanavalinA. The organisms agglutinated and were washed twice further with PBS 10 mM MgCl2. Pelleted trichomonads were resuspended in 10 ml of 1 M glycerol and injected into 12 ml of 10 mM tris hydrochloride buffer tris HC1 , pH 7.5, containing 2 mM phenylmethyl sulfonylfluoride PMSF and 1 mM MgC12. After a 10 minute incubation, the cells were homogenized further with a teflon pestle Dounce homogenizer 20 strokes and cell lysis verified by examination of the cell preparation using darkfield and phase optics on a Zeiss IM30 microscope. The homogenate was then layered on a two step gradient consisting of 8 ml of 0.5 M mannitol over 4 ml of 0.58 M sucrose. The gradient was centrifuged at 250 xg for 30 minutes and pellet represented crude membranes used for immunization protocols. Electrophoretic analysis of crude membrane material confirmed the presence of immunogenic proteins and glycoproteins previously identified as residing on T.vaginalis membranes Alderete, Infect. Immun. 40 284, 1983 . Protein values were determined by the Bradford technique Bradford, Anal. Biochem. 72 248, 1976 .B. Immunization Schedule for Hybridoma Production Different immunization protocols were used depending on antigen employed for generating immune spleen cells.Monoclonal antibodies illustrated in this embodiment are from three separate hybridization experiments, each representing the antigen described above. Spleen cells from two mice were used for each hybridization. Six to eight week old BALB CJ female mice Jackson Laboratories,Bar Harbor, Maine were employed for these studies. 1. Live organisms Mice were infected in the hind quarters by subcutaneous injection of 0.5 ml containing no less than 5 x 106 organisms per site. A second booster inoculation was performed at day 20 and a final challenge was given at day 30. Spleen cells were asceptically removed for use in hybridoma production from the immunized mice three days after the last inoculation with live organisms. This regimen allowed for the production of hightitered serum antibody levels as assayed by colorimetric ELISA and radioimmunoprecipitation electrophoretic RIP techniques. 2. Protein acrylamide and crude membrane antigen Each of two mice received an initial intraperitoneal injection with protein acrylamide antigen in Freund s complete adjuvant followed by two subsequent booster injections at day 14 and day 28 of protein acrylamide inFreund s incomplete adjuvant. Similarly, each of two mice were given intraperitoneal injections with 1 ml of a 1 1 mixture of crude membrane 2 mg protein ml and Freund s complete adjuvant.Two booster inoculums also given intraperitoneally with identical protein levels in Freund s incomplete adjuvant at days 14 and 28 after the initial injection. Spleens from each of both mice were removed for use in hybridoma production from the immunized mice three days after the last injection of antigen.C. Construction of Hybridomas Hybridomas were produced by fusing spleen cells from the immunized mice with murine SP2 0 Agl4 hybridoma cells S2 0 hereinafter using a modification of the basic procedure of Oi and Herzenberg, Immunoglobulin Producing Hybrid Cell Lines, In Selected Methods in CellularImmunology, B.B. Mishell and S.M. Shiigi, ends., pp. 35137i, W.H. Freeman and Co., 1980, San Francisco. Suitable cell lines were obtained from Ed Hayes, Duke University and are as originally set forth by Schulman et al, Nature 276 269 270 1978 . The SP2 0 hybridoma cell line is a hybrid cell line derived from SP2 HGLK formed as a hybrid between a BALB c spleen cell and the myeloma cell linesX63 Ag8.This cell line synthesizes no immunoglobulin chains, lacks the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase HGPRT , is resistant to 8 azaguanine, and dies in the presence of Littlefield s hypoxanthineaminopterin thymidine HAT selection medium. SP2 0 cells were grown in Dulbecco s Modified Eagle s Medium DMEM Microbiological Associates, Walkersville, MD supplemented with 15 vol vol heat inactivated fetal calf serum Microbiological Associates , 2 mM L glutamine, and 50 units ml penicillin and 50 g ml streptomycin. SP2 0 cells were grown in this medium containing 8 azaguanine 20pg ml immediately prior to use in hybridization experiments to ensure that no HGPRT positive revertants were present in the cell culture. Spleens were removed aseptically from immunized mice and teased apart gently with forceps to prepare a single cell suspension in DMEM 1 mM Hepes buffer MicrobiologicalAssociates . SP2 0 cells were harvested in the logarithmic phase of growth and both cell types were collected by centrifugation at 270 x g for 10 minutes at 80C and washed three times with DMEM. Total cell numbers were determined with a Neubauer Counting hemocytometer and viability was measured by trypan blue exclusion. Approximately 108 spleen cells were mixed together with SP2 0 cells in a 50 ml conical tube at a ratio of 7 viable spleen cells per viable SP2 0 cell and the resultant cell suspension was collected in a pellet by centrifugation at 270 x g for 10 minutes. The supernatant medium was removed and the tube containing the cell pellet was placed in a 370C water bath for 1 minute. A 1.0 ml portion of a warm 370C 50 wt vol solution of polyethylene glycol PEG 1000 ATCC in DMEM per 1 2 x 108 spleen cells was added to the cell pellet with gentle stirring over a 1 minute period. The suspension was stirred an additional minute. Then, 1 ml per 1 2 x 108 spleen cells of DMEM was added over an additional 1 minute period and this step repeated once more.Finally, 7 ml per 1 2 x 108 spleen cells DMEM with 20 fetal bovine serum tested for hybridoma growth, MicrobiologicalAssociates was added over 2 3 minutes. The cells were then centrifuged at 400 x g for 10 minutes and cells resuspended to 2 4 x 106 per ml in HY medium Kennett et al, Lymphocyte Hybridomas Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology, Vol. 81, pp. 77 91 1978 Springerverlag,New York and dispensed in 50 X portions containing 2 4 x 105 cells into each well of 96 well plates Costar Plastics, Vineland, New Jersey , which were then incubated at 370C in a humidified incubator containing a 7 C02 atmosphere. On day one, a 50 pl portion of a two fold concentration of Littlefield s HAT selection medium specified inLittlefield et al, Science 145 709 710 1964 was added to each well. An additional 50 iil portion of HAT was added to each well on day four. The unfused SP2 0 cells died in HAT within 24 48 hours. Cell growth in HAT medium is indicative of successful hybridization. Hybrid clones selected in HAT were usually observed by day six. After day six, all wells were fed HT glycine medium, which comprises HY medium containing 1.6 x and hypoxanthine, and 3 x 10 6M glycine. Wells which contained growing clones were assayed to detect monoclonal antibodies directed at T. vaginalis surface antigens and cells where supernatants were positive for antibody toward parasites were transferred from these individual wells into a respective well of a 24 well tissue culture plate Costar Plastics .Hybrid clones were maintained in EY medium without feeder layers and sequentially expanded to grow in T75 750mm2 flasks Costar for freezing of cell lines in 90 Fetal bovine serum Microbiological Associates 10 DMSO ATCC in liquid nitrogen.D. Characterization of Monoclonal Antibody Analysis of Anti T. vaginalis Membrane Antigen Activity in Hybridoma Supernatants Screening of hybrid clone culture supernatants for the presence of monoclonal antibodies directed against T.vaginalis membrane antigens was performed using an ELISA technique. Live trichomonas in logarithmic phase of growth were washed well in PBS and 50 ss representing 1.25 x 105 organisms were plated onto individual Immulon II strip wells Dynatech, Alexandria, VA . The cells were allowed to dry at 370C followed by fixation with 100 ethanol. Antigen coated wells remained stable over a period of 6 months and were stored at 40C until use. Antigen coated wells were washed three times with pH 7.2 phosphate buffered saline PBS . PBS 300 p1 containing 1 wt vol bovine serum albumin BSA was incubated in each microtiter well for 1 hour at room temperature to saturate nonspecific protein binding sites in the plastic well. This solution was then removed by aspiration, the wells were washed three times with PBS, 100 p1 of hybrid clone culture supernatant was added to the well and the microtiter plate was incubated at 370C for 120 minutes. Positive control wells contained mouse serum obtained from the same mouse whose spleen was employed for hybridization. Supernatant fluid was then removed by aspiration, the microtiter wells washed three times with PBS, and alkaline phosphatase conjugated goat anti mouse immunoglobulins Cappel Laboratories, Cochranville, Pennsylvania , prepared by the method of Voller et al, Bull. WHO 53 55 65, 1976, and diluted 1 500 in PBS, was then added to a final volume of 200 p1 in each microtiter well. The microtiter plates were incubated at 370C for one hour after which the conjugated antisera was removed by aspiration, the wells washed three times with PBS, and 300 p1 of enzyme substrate p nitrophenyl phosphate Sigma 1 mg ml in 10 vol vol diethanolamine buffer pH 9.8 containing 1 mMMgC12 was added to each well.Thirty minutes later, the absorbance of the solution in each well was determined spectrophotometrically at 405 nm using a Dynatech MicroELISA reader Dynatech, Alexandria, MD . Microtiter wells in which the absorbance was at least two fold greater than background levels of absorbance obtained with antigen free control wells were scored as positive for the presence of antibodies directed against T. vaginalis membrane antigens. Of approximately 500 hybrid clones screened, 28 stable hybrids demonstrated antibody reactive against T.vaginalis antigen determinants. A listing of hybrids detected is shown in Table 1.Isotypic Analysis Cultures positive for antibodies against T. vaginalis were next tested to identify the mouse antibody isotype, using standard immunological assays employing rabbit anti mouse subclass antibody reagents and peroxidaseconjugated affinity purified goat anti rabbit IgG H for use in standard ELISA Mouse immunoglobulin subtype identification kit, Boehringen Mannheim Biochemicals,Indianapolis, IN . For subtyping, 50 p1 hybridoma supernatant was incubated with T. vaginalis whole cell antigen as above after coating of nonspecific sites with BSA. After 2 hours at 370C, the wells were washed four times with PBS.Then 50 p1 of each subclass specific immunoglobulin were added to duplicate wells. Normal rabbit serum served as a negative control. After a further incubation for 2 hours and washing four times with PBS, 50 Frl peroxidase labelled goat anti rabbit Ige antibody was added to each well. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 60 minutes and wells washed another four times with PBS. Finally, 100 iil freshly prepared peroxide reagent was added to each well, and the reaction terminated after 30 minutes. Color was scanned using a Dynatech spectrophotometer at 415 nm. Isotypic analysis for each hybrid is listed inTable 1.Analysis of Anti T. vaginalis MembraneProtein Activity in Hybridoma Supernatants Culture supernatant fluids from hybrid clones which scored positive in the ELISA test were assayed by a radioimmunoprecipitation method Alderete, Infect. Immun.39 1041, 1983 and Alderete, Infect. Immun. 40 284, 1983 for the presence of monoclonal antibodies directed against trichomonal membrane proteins. Membrane proteins of T. vaginalis were radioiodinated by the method of Alderete, Infect. Immun. 40 284, 1983.Radioiodinated cells were extensively washed with PBS and pelleted organisms resuspended with 200 yl of NET 150 mMNaC1, 5 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris hydrochloride, pH 7.2 buffer containing 1 mM PMSF Sigma and placed in a 370C water bath for 10 minutes. Twenty five microliters of 10 Zwitterionic 3 12 Z3 12 detergent Calbiochem BehringCorp., La Jolla, Calif. was then added, and the mixture was gently homogenized until the trichomonads were solubilized. An additional 200 p1 of NET buffer was added, and the detergent extract was centrifuged over a 5 sucrose bed for 30 minutes at 100,000 x g with a Beckman SW50.1 rotor. Greater than 80 of the initial radioactivity was routinely recovered in the supernatant. Before mixing with antibody, the Z3 12 extract was preadsorbed with 100 p1 of 10 vol vol Formalin fixed, protein A bearing S. aureus to remove nonspecific binding proteins. Then 100 p1 of the adsorbed solubilized trichomonal proteins was mixed with 50 p1 of hybridoma supernatant and incubated overnight at 40C. Finally, 100 p1 of 10 vol vol fixed protein A bearing S. aureus was added, and incubation was continued at room temperature for a further 2 hours. The protein A bearing S.aureus adsorbed immune complexes were then sedimented at 10,000 x g for 4 minutes and washed three times in NRT 0.05 23 12 buffer. Radiolabeled antigen antibody complexes were then solubilized in electrophoresis dissolving buffer. The samples were suspended and boiled for three minutes, and protein A bearing S. aureus cells were removed by centrifugation. The supernatants containing parasite protein antigens were finally loaded on SDS polyacrylamnde slab gels. Electrophoresis was performed as described Alderete, Infect. Immun. 39 1041, 993 , and gels were fixed and processed for fluorography. The protein A bearing S. aureus cells were sequentially washed in O5 , Z3 i2 and 0.05 Z3 12 in NET buffer just before use. The formaldehyde fixed protein A bearing S. aureus organisms employed in these studies were grown and prepared as described elsewhere Alderete and Baseman,Infect. Immun. 25.1048, 1979 . Equally important was immunoprecipitation of trichomonal proteins biosynthesized and rediolabelled with 35S methionine with molecular weights identical to those obtained with radio iodinated organisms. Hence, these antigens are parasite derived membrane proteins. TABLE 1 Table 1. Monoclonal Antibodies Directed Against T. vaginalis Membran Protein Antigens.

A total of 28 monoclonal antibodies see Table 1 obtained from 3 representative hybridization experiments using different antigens were shown to be directed at T.vaginalis membrane proteins previously shown to be highly immunogenic in mice infected with live parasites Alderete, Infect. Immun. 34 1041, 1983 . Four differentT. vaginalis membrane proteins with apparent molecular weights of 270,000 270K , 230K, 65K, and 35K were recognized by one or more of these monoclonal antibodies. The 65K and 35K proteins are quantitatively dominant in gel profiles of total TCA precipitated protein material while all of these molecules are quantitatively enriched in crude membrane preparations. Monoclonal antibodies 5bB6C24 24 , DM9, DM10, andDM89 were specific for a highly immunogenic membrane protein of 270K in molecular weight. Monoclonal antibody 5bB6C20 A3 was directed against a 230K protein.Monoclonal antibodies F2FE1O C55 , F2FE10 18 , 5bB6C24 23 , and nineteen monoclonals from fusion type C were against a membrane protein of 65K in size. It is important to note that the 65K protein band of TCAprecipitated trichomonal proteins is composed of up to 30 proteins based on 2 dimensional electrophoretic analysis.The exact identity of the 65K proteins, separable by isoelectric focusing reactive with the respective monoclonal antibody is unknown. However, it is anticipated that the major immunogens of 65K molecular weight proteins are reactive with the monoclonals listed in Table 1 fusion type C . Analysis of Anti T. vaginalis CellSurface Exposed Protein Activity The twenty eight monoclonal antibodies listed inTable 1 that were shown to be directed against T.vaginalis membrane proteins were identified in radioimmunoprecipitation assays using solubilized membrane proteins as antigen. In order to determine if any of these monoclonal antibodies were directed against cell surface exposed portions of these outer membrane proteins, hybrid clone supernatants were used in indirect immuno fluorescence assays.Adsorption of hybrid clone culture supernatants with intact cells was accomplished b Incu bating 200 500 l of hybrid clone culture supernatant with 1 x 1C5 intact, washed trichomonads for 30 minutes at 37 C Cnly three monoclonal antibodies from fusion A ,FliD3C10, F2FElC C55 and F2FE10 18 , and all monoclonal antibodies from fusion C could not be detected by fluorescence microscopy. The remaining monoclonal anti bodies were readily detected by strong fluorescerce of parasites, and hence, indicative of recognizing a cell surface exposed protein antigen.The proteins recognized by these antibodies are highly immunogenic membrane antigens, and epitopes essential for recognition by these antibodies are exposed on live, motile organisms.Strain Distribution of the Antigenic Determinant It was of interest to determine if the antigenic determinant recognized by the monoclonal antibodies were unique to the immunizing T. vaginalis strain or whether this antigenic determinant might be found in other pathogenic human trichomonal strains. Accordingly, six different clinical isolates of T. vaginalis strains 286,JH31A, JHHZH, JHHR, JHHEL, and JHHW collected over a two year period were examined for the presence of the anti genic determinant recognized by monoclonal antibodies.Small 200 portions of respective culture supernatants were employed in the standard ELISA assay used to detect monoclonal antibody activity directed against membrane proteins. All monoclonal antibodies described in Table 1 detected all strains to the same extent as the homologous strain employed as the immunization agent, strain 286.Importantly, strains 286 and JH31A were cultivated invitro for several years and thus represented long term grown cultures while the other strains were fresh isolates grown for no longer than 3 4 days in Applicant s laboratory prior to testing. E. Immunodiagnosis of Trichomonal Vaginitis The hybridoma cell lines and the monoclonal antibodies produced therefrom described in this application are useful for detection of T. vaginalis antigen in vaginal swabs of infected individuals. As such, they represent candidates for development of an immunodiagnostic test for differentiation of trichomonal vaginitis from similar symptomology caused by other etiologic agents. EXAMPLE I A subset of monoclonal antibodies representative of the four membrane proteins recognized by the antibodies by radioimmunoprecipitation electrophoretic techniques just described were evaluated for detection of trichomonal antigen in swabs from four different infected individuals.The monoclonal antibody test reagents were derived from the respective hybrid clones F2FElO C55 , F2FE1O C18 , 5bB6C20 A3 , and 5bB6,C24 24 . The diagnostic test samples consisting of vaginal material from infected humans were provided on cotton swabs placed in sterile screw capped 15 x 125 mm tubes and were received from Dr. Michael Spence, The Johns Hopkins Unlvers ty. Upon arrival in our laboratory, the swabs were immersed in 1 ml sterile PBS with 1 mM PMSF and vortexed. Soluble material was clarified from particulate debris by centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 10 minutes, and supernatant containing possible aqueous soluble parasite material was frozen at 700C until use. Pellet was dissolved in 0.05 Zwittengent 3 12 detergent Calbiochem.Behring, Inc., La Jolla, CA re clarified by centrifuga tion, and detergent soluble material also frozen 70 C until use. Detection of T. vaginalis proteins with monoclonal antibody reagents was accomplished by ELISA using respec tive antibody obtained from ascites fluid as the attractor molecule adsorbed to microtiter well plates by the Method of Voller described supra . One microgram 1 g sites protein was added to individual wells of poly vinylchloride Immunlon II microtiter plates Dynatech and incubation continued at 370C overnight. Prior to use inELISA, nonspecific binding sites were blocked With a 2 hour incubation with PBS BSA as before.To individual wells, 100 l of aqueous or detergent soluble injected human swab material was added and plates placed at 37tC for 2 hours Plates were then washed three times withPBS, and 50 b of a polyclonal rabbit antise to strain 286 added. After an additional 60 minutes incubation at 370C, wells were washed three times with PBS and alkaline phosphatase goat anti rabbit antibody added. Upon incubation at 370C for 60 minutes, wells were washed again three times with PBS, substrate added, and wells placed in 370C incubated for 60 minutes further. Color was recorded at 405 nm using a Dynatech microtiter well scanner.Control material represented a similar preparation and swab obtained from a normal individual with no history of trichomoniasis or an individual with a vaginitis of a different etiology. Each of the four tested monoclonal antibody types reacted positively with each of the sample infected materials. None of the tested monoclonal antibody types reacted significantly with the control sample material from uninfected individuals. EXAMPLE 2 An alternative method for testing the efficacy of representative monoclonal antibodies for detecting T.vaginalis membrane proteins in body fluids of infected individuals was performed. Five to 7 ml of vaginal wash obtained by injection of 10 ml sterile PBS into the vagina of control and infected volunteer females was obtained from Michael Spence, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.The wash was clarified by centrifugation, and supernatant concentrated by lyophilization. Material was re dissolved into 500 p1 volumes using carbonate buffer Voller , and 50 p1 aliquots plated into individual wells of microtiter well plates Immulon II, Dynatech . Polyclonal mouse antiserum 50 p1 against T. vaginalis 286 and each of the individual monoclonal antibodies F2FElO C55 F2FElO C18 5bB6C20 A3 and 5bB6C24 24 were then added to respective wells coated with concentrated vaginal wash material.After a 60 minute incubation, the wells were washed three times with PBS, and alkaline phosphatase goat anti mouse antibody added to each well. After a 60 minutes incubation at 370C, plates were washed, and substrate added.Reactivity was recorded at 405 nm using a Dynatech spectrophotometric scanner. Each of the four tested monoclonal antibody types were reactive with each of the wash samples taken from infected individuals. None of the monoclonal antibodies reacted to a significant degree with wash samples from uninfected individuals. EXAMPLE 3 Because testing of all monoclonal antibodies gener ated from the successful hybridomas could not be vxten sively evaluated using human materials, the ability of ke monoclonal antibodies to detect T. vaginalis membrane proteins shed during growth and multiplication was evaluated. Since all trichomonal strains shed membrane proteins during the course of logarithmic growth, these membrane proteins might be present in body fluids vagin21 wash, mucous, swab . An ELISA, therefore, was used to measure parasite antigen detected by the monoclonal antibodies.Monoclonal antibodies 1p g from ascites fluid were adsorbed onto microtiter plate wells ImmulonII, Dynatech as before, and 100 u1 of culture supernatant from logarithmically growing wells added to each well.All welts were pretreated with PBS BSA to coat nonspecifIc binding sites. After 2 hours at 37 C, rabbit anti serum against strain 286 was added and wells placed in a 37 C incubator for 60 minutes. The wells were then washed again with PBS, and added alkaline phosphatase goat antimouse allowed to incubate at 37 C for 60 minutes. After washing of the wells with PBS, substrate was added, and color, indicative of a positive reaction, was recorded at 405 nm. Controls represented monoclonal antibody generated against protein antigens of M. pneumoniae as well as normal rabbit serum. Also, sterile un inoculated medium was employed to show the parasite origin of detected materials. Results are tabulated in Table 1, reacts with Shed Ag for each of the monoclonal antibody types. F. Utility The hybridoma cell lines and the monoclonal antibodies produced therefrom described in this application are useful in the purification and characterization of specific antigenic and immunogenic components presented byTrichomonas vaginalis organisms. Moreover, the monoclonal antibodies produced from a given hybridoma line are homogeneous in antigenic recognition and thereby are useful for subsequent affinity chromatography based purification of trichomonal membrane antigens. Furthermore, the availability of different monoclonal antibodies directed against one or more antigenic determinants of the same membrane antigen of T. vaginalis is useful in studying the structure and function of membrane components. Similarly, these same monoclonal antibodies are valuable in the idiotypic analysis of antibody response to cell surface structure of a pathogenic microorganism. Ultimately, the availability of monoclonal antibodies directed against selected T. vaginalis membrane antigens, in particular cell surface exposed membrane proteins, will facilitate studies on the vaccinogenic potential of these proteins. The foregoing description of the invention has been directed to particular embodiments for purposes of explanation and illustration. It will be apparent, however, to those skilled in the art that many modifications and changes in the processes of preparing and implementing the described embodiments may be made without departing from the essence of the invention. For example, it is contemplated that hybridoma cell lines may be developed fusing human myeloma cells and human lymphocytes primed to membrane antigens of T.vaginalis. In another example, monoclonal antibodies can be developed which are specific for individual T. vaginalis strains other than strain 286 used in these hybrizization experiment. Also, hybridoma cells can be constructed from the differentiated lymphoid cells of mice immunized by alternate routes and methods. Similarly, other mouse strains can be used to produce hybridoma cells elaboratincr similar sets of monoclonal antibodies suitable to the purposes described herein. Moreover Qnoclal anti bodies need not be limited against protein components of the membrane. Development of hybridoma producing antibody against carbohydrate moieties of the membrane glycoproteins or unique lipids found only in trichomonads can be developed according to the processes of this invention. Such antibodies would be useful in the purification, isolation, and structural determination of the same or other molecules of the membrane of Trichomonas vaginalisThese and other modifications and uses of the depicted embodiment, as well as other embodiments of the invention, will be apparent to those skilled in the art. It isApplicant s intention in the following claims to cover all equivalent modifications and variations as fall within the scope of the invention.
