# Polypropylene base resin composition.

## Abstract
Disclosed herein is a polypropylene base resin composi tion obtained by heating at a temperature of 170 C 280 C a mixture containing a crystalline ethylene propylene block copolymer having a specific composition, an ethylene propylene copolymer rubber having a specific composition and viscosity, an inorganic filler having a specific particle size, and an organic peroxide, all in specified amounts. The thus obtained polypropylene base resin compositions may have high molding fluidity and be inexpensive and their moldings have excellent low temperature impact resistance and painta bility along with high stiffness. They are thus suitable for use in the production of large moldings such as automobile bum pers, fenders and body sidemembers.
