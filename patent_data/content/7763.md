## Description
This invention relates to an electrical switch assembly of the kind wherein a fixed part of the assembly carries a reed switch and acts as the mounting of the assembly for mounting the assembly on the wall of a liquid reservoir, and a float carried by said fixed part and movable relative thereto in response to changes in the level of liquid in the reservoir in use, said float carrying a magnet which in a particular location of the float relative to said fixed part operates said reed switch. It will be recognised that in the majority of cases the assembly is introduced into the reservoir by way of an aperture in the reservoir wall, the aperture in use being closed by the fixed part of the assembly. In a previously proposed arrangement of the kind specified the fixed part includes a generally linear body housing the reed switch and the float carrying the magnet is pivotally mounted on the body in such a manner that in an operative position the portion of the float carrying the magnet lies alongside the portion of the body housing the reed switch. This configuration of the assembly has the smallest thickness possible for the assembly and so determines the size of the aperture in the reservoir wall through which the assembly is inserted in use. However this smallest thickness configuration is still too thick for many applications since the portion of the float carrying the magnet and the portion of the body housing the reed switch are side by side. Another previous proposal sought to achieve a slimmer configuration thus requiring a smaller mounting aperture in the reservoir wall. In this construction the fixed part again has a linear body housing the reed switch but the magnet, carried again by a float is mounted on the body for pivotal movement about an axis transverse to and intersecting the longitudinal axis of the body, the pivotal axis passing through the mid point of the dipole length of the magnet and affording a configuration of the assembly wherein the magnet and float are aligned end to end with the body.Although this construction affords a slimmer configuration it suffers from the disadvantage that unless the float occupies a position with its longitudinal axis co incident with the axis of the body during withdrawal of the unit from the narrow aperture in the wall of the reservoir then the float will act as a latch preventing such withdrawal.Since the float is pivotally mounted on the body about an axis passing through the mid point of the float then there will be no tendency for the float to align itself with the body and thus there will be an appreciable risk that withdrawal of the unit will be obstructed. It is an object of the present invention to provide an assembly of the kind specified wherein the disadvantages of the two aforementioned assemblies are minimised. A float operated electrical switch assembly according to the invention includes a fixed part having a generally linearly extending body housing a reed switch aligned with the length of the body, a float pivotally mounted on the body for movement relative thereto about an axis transverse to the length of the body to a position wherein the float is aligned end to end with the body, and a magnet carried by the float at its end adjacent the body, the magnet extending across the width of the float and so lying transverse to the body length when the float and body are aligned and the magnet having its dipole length aligned with the length of the float so as to be aligned with the length of the body when the float and body are aligned whereby part of the magentic flux path of the magnet passes transversely through the reed switch to operate the reed switch. One example of the invention is illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein Figure 1 is a side elevational view of a float operated electrical switch assembly Figure 2 is a view similar to Figure 1 of an alternative form of switch in position in a water reservoir Figure 3 is an inverted plan view of the switch shown in Figure 2 and Figure 4 is a sectional view on the line III III in Figure 3. Referring to the drawings, the switch assembly 11 comprises a fixed part 12 including a linearly extending body part 13. Pivotally mounted on the body part 13 is an elongate float 14. The assembly 12 is intended for use in conjunction with a liquid reservoir, for example an internal combustion engine sump 15 Figure 1 of a water tank 15a. Figures 2 to 4 The assembly is introduced into the reservoir through an aperture in the wall of the reservoir. In Figure 1 the aperture is slightly larger in diameter than the body part 13 and is closed thereby. In the construction shown in Figs.2 4 the part t2 of the assembly closes the aperture in use, and provides the mounting means of the switch assembly.The fixed part 12 includes a flange 16 which engages the exterior of the wall of the tank 15, and from which extends a ribbed boss 17 the ribs of which tightly engage the surface of the aperture in the wall of the tank 15 to seal the aperture and to hold the switch assembly 11 in position relative to the tank. Thus a portion of the fixed part 12 lies outside the tank, and the remainder of the fixed part including the body 13 together with the float 14 lie within the tank. If desired additional securing means can be provided for fixing the part 12 in position relative to thewall of the tank. Conveniently the boss 17 and flange 16 are integral parts of a synthetic rubber sleeve secured to the fixed part 12, the material of the sleeve being sufficiently compliant to provide the sealing and securing functions. In both the Figure 1 and Figure 2 constructions the body 13 is formed from synthetic resin material, and is hollow. Housed within the body 13 are a reed switch 18 and electrical connections 19 thereto. The electrical connections extend to terminals projecting from the portion of the fixed part 12 at the exterior of the reservoir in use. The reed switch 18 is positioned with its longitudinal axis parallel to the longitudinal axis of the body 13 and is adjacent the outer periphery of the body 13. The float 14 is a hollow synthetic resin moulding of circular cross section and of diameter substantially equal to the diameter of the circular section of the body 13.The body 13 is provided with a pair of diameterically opposed flat surfaces 13a and the portion of the body 13 carrying the flat surfaces 13a is received between a pair of arms 14a integral with the float 14 and extending in the direction of the length thereof. A pair of diametrically opposed posts 21 integral with the body 13 extend through respective apertures adjacent the ends of the arms 14a to pivotally interconnect the float 14 and the body 13. The common axis of the posts 21 and thus the pivotal axis of the float 14 relative to the body 13 extend at right angles to and intersect the longitudinal axis of the body 13 and the float 14. Moreover, in use, the pivotal axis is arranged to be horizontal. Stops 22 provided on the body 13 engage the arms 14a to limit movement of the float 14 relative to the body 13 in a clockwise direction as viewed in Figure 1 at a position wherein the longitudinal axis of the float 14 is co extensive with the longitudinal axis of the body 13. The float 14 can pivot relative to the body under gravity, in a counter clockwise direction through 0 an angular distance of 70 at which point further stops on the body 13 engage the arms 14a to prevent further movement of the float 14 relative to the body 13. Thus the float 13 has an overall freedom of movement of 700 relative to the body 13. In the position where the longitudinal axes of the float 14 and body 13 are coextensive the inner most end of the float 14 is closely adjacent the outermost end of the body 13.The innermost end of the float 14 is formed with a cylindrical recess 23 the axis of which is co extensive with the longitudinal axis of the float 14. A cylindrical magnet 24 is adhesively secured in the recess 23, the magnet 24 having one of its flat faces constituting the north pole of the magnet and its opposite flat face contitutv ing the south pole. Thus the magnet P4 has a relatively short dipole length by comparison with its width, the dipole length of the magnet 24 being aligned with the longitudinal axis of the float 14. It will be recognised that since the dipole length of the magnet 24 is parallel to the reed switch 18, then in the position of the float 14 where its axis is co extensive with the axis of the body 13 the flux path of the magnet 24 will pass longitudinally through the reed switch 18, and so the blades of the switch 18 will be magnetised so as to be attracted to one another thus closing the switch. Part of the flux path of the magnet 24 is shown diagrammatically in Figure 4. Moreover throughout part of the arc of movement of the float 14 relative to the body, sufficient of the flux path of the magent will pass through the reed switch 18 in a direction relative thereto to retain the reed switch in a closed condition.In the example shown in the drawings the reed switch will remain operated throughout the first 450 of the movement of the float 14 from the position wherein the axes of the float and the body are aligned. The position of the float 14 relative to the body at which the blades of the reed switch cease to be attracted to one another is shown in chain broken line in Figure 2 and thereafter the magentism of the blades by the magnet 24 is such that they repel one another thus opening the switch. The extreme position of the float is shown in Figure 2 in broken lines. The line 25 in Figure 2 is indicative of the liquid level at which switching will take place. That is to say the line 25 represents the level corresponding to the position of the float 14 at which the magnet 24 ceases to cause closure the reed switch 18. Thus when the level of liquid in the reservoir 15 or 15a is above the level indicated by the line 25 then the reed switch 18 will be closed, but when the level falls below the level indicated by the line 25 the reed switch will be opened. In practice opening and closing the switch does not occur at the same point in the movement of the float as a result of the hysteresis of the system.It will be recognised that the reed switch 18, can be a normally open switch or a normally closed switch, in the one case falling level closing the switch and in the other case falling level opening the switch. Opening or closing of the reed switch will be used to give either a warning that the liquid level in the reservoir 15 or 15a is low, or alternatively will initiate operation of a liquid supply system to restore the level in the reservoir. The use of a magnet having a dipole length which is short in comparison to the width of the magnet is preferred since this arrangement affords a more efficient use of magnetic material in terms of useful flux for a given magnet volume as a result of longer flux return path in the system that would occur using a magnet of dipole length longer than magnet width. Moreover the flux path within the reed switch can be modified if desired by the incorporation in the switch of an appropriately shaped element formed from magnetic material.
