# An insulator for use in electrolytic cells.

## Abstract
An insulator for supporting a spooled electrode contact bar 43 and head bars 64 of removable, alternating cathodes and anodes in an electrolytic cell. The insulator comprises an elongated body 10 formed of a synthetic material having a longitudinal outwardly and downwardly sloping upper sur face 14, 16 extending from a centre line 18 to the side edges 20, 22 of the body 10 , a row 24, 26 of equi spaced shoul ders formed longitudinally on each upper surface 72 adja cent to the said centre line offset relative to each other, each row 24, 26 of shoulders 30, 32 having a transverse channel 34, 36 formed between each pair of adjacent shoulders for draining liquid towards a side edge 20, 22 of the body 10 , a longitudinal V shaped groove 40 formed between the two rows 24, 26 of shoulders 30, 32 for supporting the spooled electrode contact bar 43 between the rows 24, 26 of shoul ders 30, 32 and a cavity 50, 52 formed in each upper surface 14, 16 opposite each shoulder 30, 32 between the shoulder and the respective edge 20, 22 of the body 10 for receiving an insulating block 54, 56 therein for supporting one end 62 of the electrode head bars 64 .
