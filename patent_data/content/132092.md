# Apparatus for manufacturing electrical harnesses.

## Abstract
Apparatus for manufacturing electrical harnesses that include wires and electrical connectors comprises a wire feed path W extending horizontally and axially of the apparatus, a connector attaching device 11 located alongside the wire feed path W and including a punch 21 and a die 22 wher eby the wires are pressed into connectors 3 , and a cutter 26 located adjacent to but operated independently of the punch and die. A wire measuring and feeding device 14 is reciproc ally movable along the wire feed path W and includes an intermittently movable chuck 115 whereby the connected attached wires are pulled to a desired length. A connector selecting and supplying device selects connectors having a desired number of poles supplies them to the die 22 and a wire selecting and supplying device 13 includes a chuck 92 for selecting the wires which correspond to the selected con nectors and supplying the selected wires to the connector attaching device 11 . The wire selecting and supplying device 13 can hold the wires 2 fed from reels 4 , the amount of movement and frequencies of the reciprocal movements of the movable chuck 115 being predetermined as desired, the operation of the cutter 26 being effected only when the movable chuck 115 is at rest, so that various types of harnes ses can be produced in which the number of poles of the connectors, the number and position thereof and the intervals thereof are determined as desired.
