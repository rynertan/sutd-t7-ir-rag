It is well known that Escherichia coli E. coli host vector system is useful for recombinant DNA work. However, this E. coli host vector system is not satisfactory for production of substances which are produced by higher animals. On the other hand, Acremonium chrysogenum ATCC 11550 A. chrysogenum ATCC 11550 is used in the manufacture of many clinically important semi synthetic cephalosporin antibiotics. Further, it is known that A. chrysogenum ATCC 11550 produces extracellularly an alkaline protease in large volume over 1g ℓ J. Ferment. Technol. The inventors of the present invention, as a result of extensive study, have succeeded in cloning autonomous replication sequence ARS of DNAs of A. chrysogenum ATCC 11550 and in introducing the ARS into a shuttle vector of E. coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae S. cerevisiae , and then in constructing a new type of plasmids which are useful as vectors in recombinant DNA work in which A. chrysogenum or S. cerevisiae is used as a host. Accordingly, one object of the present invention is to provide new DNA fragments of A. chrysogenum ATCC 11550 which functions as an autonomous replication sequence ARS in S. cerevisiae and A. chrysogenum. Another object of the present invention is to provide new type of hybrid plasmids pLEU97, pCEP97 and pCYG97 which are useful as vectors in recombinant DNA work in which A. chrysogenum or S. cerevisiae is used as a host. Further object of the present invention is to provide new microorganisms bearing said new plasmids.

The following are general methods for preparation of pLEU97, pCEP97 and pCYG97. The molecular size of the pLEU 97 which is measured by agarose gel electrophoresis method, is about 11.2 Kbp. The autonomous replication sequence ARS DNA part in the plasmid pLEU97 the same in plasmids pCEP97 and pCYG97 shows a unique restriction enzyme cleavage pattern and the molecular size of the same which is measured by agarose gel and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis methods is about 1.39 Kbp and is recognized a new DNA. The plasmid pCEP97 which is obtained by digesting pLEU97 with restriction enzyme, PstI and by ligating the resulting digestion with T4 DNA ligase, is characterized by the restriction enzymes cleavage map as shown in Fig. 4. The molecular size of the pCEP97 which is measured by agarose gel and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis methods, is about 7.38 Kbp. The autonomous replication sequence ARS DNA part in the pCEP97 is the same one as that in pLEU97. Accordingly, the plasmid pCEP97 containing said new ARS is a new plasmid. The plasmid pCYG97 constructed as above is characterized by the restriction enzymes cleavage map as shown in Fig. 5. The molecular size of the pCYG97 which is measured by agarose gel and polyacrylamid gel electrophoresis methods, is about 9.08 Kbp. The autonomous replication sequence ARS DNA part in the pCYG97 is the same one as that in pLEU97.

The plasmid pLEU97 containing the specific ARS DNA of A. chrysogenum ATCC 11550 is useful as a vector in recombinant DNA work in which A. chrysogenum or S. cerevisiae is used as a host and leucin is used as a selection marker. The plasmid pCEP97 per se containing the specific ARS DNA of A. chrysogenum ATCC 11550 is useful as an intermediate for constructing the plasmid pCYG97 and is also useful as a vector in recombinant DNA work in which A. chrysogenum or S. cerevisiae is used as a host, by further introducing a proper selection marker into this pCEP97. The plasmid pCYG97 containing the specific ARS DNA of A. chrysogenum ATCC 11550 is useful as a vector in recombinant DNA work in which A. chrysogenum or S. cerevisiae is used as a host and the aminoglycoside antibiotic G418 resistance is used as a selection marker,and further in addition to the antibiotic G418 Kanamycin and Neomycin are also used as a selection marker in A. chrysogenum.
