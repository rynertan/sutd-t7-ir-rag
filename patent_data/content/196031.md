# LIGHT SENSITIVE COMPOSITIONS AND LIGHT SENSITIVE MATERIALS

## Abstract
A light sensitive composition comprising a phenolic resol wherein the ratio of the number of dibenzylic ether linkages to the total number of dibenzylic ether, methylene and methylol linkages linked to phenolic nucleus is 15 mol. or more and which is obtained by a reaction between a phenol of the for mula I A light sensitive composition comprising a condensate of the phenolic resol and an o quinone diazido sulfonylhalide. A light sensitive material comprising the above men tioned composition. A method for making a planographic printing plate from the light sensitive material, characterized in that burning in process is carried out at a lower temperature or a shortened time.
