# A portable container for rolled up drawings consisting in telescopic elements and a variable length blocking device.

## Abstract
A portable container for rolled up drawings consisting in at least two telescopic elements 1 and 2, of prismatic shape and square section for the length modification of the inner space so as to be adapted to the length of the con tained drawings, and provided with a blocking device for said elements 1 and 2 in the chosen position consisting in a sliding pushbutton 3 which with projections 4 and 5 thereof causes pins 11, being out of one piece with small elastic bars 12, to get inserated into the housings of rack 17, being of the same thickness of inner element 1, thus preventing any movement of said elements 1 and 2 and any defor mation of the inner space.

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. A portable container for rolled up drawings consisting in telescopic elements 1 and 2 and in a blocking device, characterized in that said elements 1 and 2 are of pris matic shape and square section and characterized in a push button 3 sliding in slit 9 out of one piece with the outer end of element 2 that will distance, by means of projections 4 and 5 thereof, toothed pins 11 leading said pins to gain in housings 17 of a rack out of the same thickness of inner element 1 , thus preventing the sliding of elements 1 and 2 and causing the blocking the reof in different positions according to the length of the contained rolls. 2. A container for rolled up drawings with telescopic elements and blocking device, with variable length, according to claim 1, characterized in that said toothed pins 11 are out of one piece with small elastic bars 12 which will form, together with small end plates 13 a continuous rectangular structure, so that the sliding of pushbutton 3 causes projections 4 and 5 to push against shapes 14 of pins 11 determining the introduction of small teeth it into the housings of rack 17 . 3. A container for rolled up drawings with telescopic elements and blocking device, with variable length, according to claim 1, characterized in the large rack with steps or teeth 18 placed in groove 19 laterally realized in inner con tainer 1 , against which plane 7 rests after each forc ed . vDment, for varying the total length of the telescopic container. 4. A container for rolled up drawings with telescopic elements and blocking device, with variable length, according to claim 1, characterized in end openings on elements 1 and 2 closed by taps 20 for introducing and taking off the draw ings without disengaging the axial blocking means.

## Description
A PORTABLE CONTAINER FOR ROLLED UP DRAWINGS CONSISTINGIN TELESCOPIC ELEMENTS AND A VARIABLE LENGTH BLOCKINGDEVICE The present invention concerns a telescopic container for carrying about rolled up drawings, that may be adapted with a blocking device for the components thereof to the length of the roll that is to be contained.Actually, no container for drawings is known in the art able to prevent, during transport, undesired movements of the contained roll.Infact, sometimes plastic or paperboard tubes are used for said purpose, said tubes being placed one inside the other and kept in position due to the friction between the surfaces into contact, but in case of eventual shocks or due to other reasons said tubes may reciprocally slide thus causing a considerable deterioration of the inner rolls.It is the aim of the present invention to realize a container of easy realization and low cost for carrying about drawings rolls of different dimensions, little encumbersome and of sure functionality.According to the present invention, said aim is reached by means of a container consisting in at least two prisma tic tubes preferably having a square section, with a telescopic connection such as to enter one into the other for carrying about drawing rolls of minimum dimensions placed inside or, following to the partial extraction of the inner tube, able to reach different dimensions according to those of the contained rolls, said dimensions being kept fixed without any possibility of sliding, by a blocking device consisting in two toothed pins that may be distanced by means of a pushbutton sliding inside a slit, being out of one piece and provided nearby the open end of the outer telescopic element, so that it may get introduced into the toothing of a rack, said rack being of the same thickness cf the inner element, thus preventing the reciprocal movement of said elements.Said sliding pushbutton shows, on the two sides thereof, one or more projections, which determine the distancing of said toothed pins, as well as a cavity allowing the elastic return of said pins when said elements get disengaged, said elements now being no longer constrained and therefore reciprocally sliding again so as to provide for the opening of the container or for the variation of the total length thereof.The present invention will be described more in detail hereinbelow according to the attached drawings showing one preferred embodiment. Fiyure 1 shows a perspective view in partial transparence of a container for rolled up drawings consisting in telescopic elements according to the present invention.Figure 2 shows a detail of an axonometric, exploded view of the blocking device.The figures show a container for rolled up drawings comprising element 1 of prismatic structure and square section being telescopically inserted into outer element 2, of similar shape, characterized in the blocking device consisting in pushbutton 3 provided with end lateral projections 4 and 5 being separated by cavities 6, said pushbutton being sliding on resting plane 7 of the same shape of element 2 and projecting, with upper edge 8, from slit 9 provided in plate 10 that becomes out of one piece by means of the gain of pins 15 to the outer end of element 2 and by toothed pins 11 out of one piece with small elastic bars 12 which, together with small end plates 13, provided with holes 14 for the gain of small pins 15 of plate 10, form a rectangular continuous structure, so that the sliding, caused by the pressure performed onto said pushbutton 3, leads said projections 4 and 5 against shapes 14 of pins 11 and the introduction of small teeth 16 into corresponding housings 17, laterally realized in the shape of a rack out of the same thickness of inner element 1, preventing, according to the aim set forth, any movement of said two telescopic elements 1 and 2.A further blocking of the free movement of elements 1 and 2 is realized by means of the rack with large steps or teeth 18 placed in groove 19 laterally realized in inner containerI, against which plane 7 rests every time it is forced to move, so as to vary the total length of the telescopic container.One ot both said elements 1 and 2 may show, in a preferred embodiment, openings that may also be circular, provided at the ends thereof and closed by taps 20, for introducing and taking off the drawings without disengaging the axial blocking.
