EXAMPLE 2 In an alternative procedure to that described above inExample 1 a reaction kit can be devised that is in accordance with the invention to provide a basis for rapid testing on the farm so that problem cows can be quickly located by testing a sample of milk representing a mixture of the four quarters of the cow which is a composite sample. Following location of problem animals at one milking, these can be checked again at the next milking by carrying out a test on each quarter separately. This can be achieved by using a sampling device designed to take separate samples of each teat of the cow s udder simultaneously and placing each sample in a set of four square reaction cuvettes. A first substrate may comprise 68 mg. of pNP NAG to which has been added 2 ml. of ethanol. After shaking 8 ml. of 1M citrate buffer at pH 4.3 may be added to provide a 2Oiii4 pNP NAG solution. In this solution calculated on a basis of per lOOg. H20 and an equal volume of milk to be added there is present 6X substrate, 65S citrate and 29X citric acid. However, in this specific case it should be remembered that 20 of ethanol is present in the 100 g. H20 criterion. Alternatively a second substrate may comprise 68 mg pNP NAG in 4.0 ml, of lM.pH 4,5 citrate buffer. This may comprise 1.5X substrate, 68 citrate and 30,5X citric acid per 100 g, H20 and on an equal volume of milk to be added. In the case of the first substrate solution a small volume eg. 0.05 ml can be added directly to 0.45 0,50 ml of milk sample contained in stable reaction vessels such as test tubes or cuvettes. The following discussion concerns a detailed assay method using the first substrate.EQUIPMENT NEEDED i It may be necessary to firstly collect samples in separate bottles then transfer 0.45 0,50 ml. of each to the reaction cuvettes. Alternatively, a sampling device may be used as referred to above. ii Reaction tubes preferably sets of 4 square 1 cm x 1 cm cuvettes capable of holding 3 4 mis. iii Disposable pipettes. iv It may be advantageous to have a small portable incubator capable of holding samples at 37sC for up to 10 mins A polyurethane block specially cut to hold the set of 4 cuvettes would be adequate, v The substrate vials could be fitted with a screw cap containing an eye dropper which delivered approximately 0.05 ml. of solution with each drop see Method below .METHOD a Collect or transfer 0.45 0.50 ml. of milk into each of the four cuvettes. Ensure that the temperature of the milk is around 374C, If all composites have been collected first before testing started, then rewarm them back to 370C if they had cooled down. b Add 0.05 ml. or 1 drop of the warmed 370C substrate solution and mix. c Place in suitable incubator see previous comments and stand for 5 5 mins1 if exwawning 4 quarter samples NOTE Always test quarters from the same animal in the 4 cuvette system ii 10 mins. if examining composite samples. d Stop each reaction with 2.5 mls. of 2 Na4EDTA and mlx each set of tubes by inverting a few times. For quarter samples, the best way of deciding if one or more quarters are mastitic is to look for an imbalance in the colours of the 4 cuvettes. Negative quarters are usually colourless or slightly coloured yellow , while mastitic quarters are definitely yellow. If all quarters are definitely yellow and to the same intensity it means that all quarters are infected or that there is some other physiological disturbance which is causing an abnormal secretion in all quarters. Cows showing this pattern should be watched closely to see if the secretory disturbance blights itself or if indeed it is really a widespread mastitic infection. For composite samples, a quick visual observation of a set of tests say 40 i.e. 10 sets of cuvettes will enable an operator to pick out the worst animals. Closer observation with a set of colour standards to refer to, will enable the more marginal animals to be located. These animals can then be checked next milking by examining their individual quarter samples. Although the procedure outlined above works well some improvements could be made by changing the substrate to 4 methyl umbelliferyl NAG which when hydrolysed by NAGase becomes fluorescent.Because of the greater sensitivity of this fluorescent substrate, the reaction time could be reduced dramatically to say 1 2 nins. for quarter sample analyses and 4 5 mins. for composite sample analyses .The only other apparatus needed would be a portable light source which emitts light of a wave length in the range 350 380 nm. In the case of the second substrate 0.2 nil. aliquots of substrate buffer was transferred into a plurality of cuvettes and freeze dried. When required to be used 0.4 0.5 ml. of milk was transferred to each cuvette and each cuvette then shaken, In the case of both the first and second substrates a suitable stopping .agent may be 2 vials each containing 5 g. of Na4EDTA.wh k h may be dissolved in 250 ml. of H20. Standard vials may also be used as described previously. However, if desired it may be possible to provide a card showing a series of increasing intensities of the yellow colour with which the final test colours may be compared, It will also be appreciated that instead of containers containing one or more reaction system components such as cuvettes or vials a suitable supporting medium may be used. Materials which may form the supportbg medium are those materials which by means of capillary action or any other physical chemical technique are able to hold liquids. Examples include filter paper, fibrous material including cellulose materials wood strips, felt, porous ceramic strips and cotton substrates.
