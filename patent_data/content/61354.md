# Process and composition for conditioning an aqueous system.

## Abstract
An aqueous composition for conditioning an aqueous system, for example a sewage slurry, comprises an alkaline earth metal hydroxide, e.g. lime, and an anionic oligomeric polyelectrolyte, e.g. a salt of polyacrylic acid. Other compo nents may include a weighting agent, e.g. calcium carbonate, a cationic flocculant, e.g. a polyacrylamide, and a base such as sodium hydroxide.
