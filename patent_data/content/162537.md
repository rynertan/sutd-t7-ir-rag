# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR DEMOISTURIZING AND HEATING DRYING AIR FOR DRYING SYNTHETIC PLASTIC MATERIAL

## Abstract
Drying air to be circulated for drying plastic material is demoistured and heated by one of two separate adsorbing treatment units. When one of the two units is engaged in adsorbing treatment of the drying air, the other unit engages in a desorbing treatment and cooling treatment for regen erating the adsorbent by the use of desorbing high temper ature air passing through the unit in a direction reverse to that in which the drying air is passed through the unit. The cooling treatment of the adsorbent after the desorbing treat ment is accomplished by the use of a part of the drying air.
