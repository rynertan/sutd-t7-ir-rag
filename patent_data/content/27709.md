# An ink for a printer using liquid ink.

## Abstract
An ink for a printer using liquid ink, for example, ink jet printer, includes a component for dissolving surface treat ment material and or sizing material applied to the surface of a recording medium. Thus the ink may have a pH in the range 10 to 14, preferably 12 to 13.5, at 20 C. The ink basically comprises no more than 10 parts by weight of a water soluble dye, 0.001 to 15 parts by weight of a strong basic material, such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, and 5 to 45 parts by weight of a wetting agent. The ink may also include a surfactant, an anti mould agent and a compound to prevent clogging of a nozzle orifice of the ink jet printer.
