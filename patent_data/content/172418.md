# Radiation image recording and read out apparatus.

## Abstract
A radiation image recording and read out apparatus is provided with a body comprising a system for conveying stimulable phosphor sheets 30 for recording radiation images along a path A , and an image recording section 40 and an image read out section 50 which are positioned on the path. The apparatus body is provided with a section 62 positioned at the upstream end of the path for feeding the stimulable phosphor sheets to the sheet conveying system, and a section 61 positioned at the downstream end of the path for ejecting the stimulable phosphor sheets from the sheet conveying system. Or, the apparatus body is con nected by conveyor belts with an erasing unit for erasing radiation energy remaining in the stimulable phos phor sheets after image read out. The apparatus body and the erasing unit are positioned separately of each other in spaced relation by a predetermined distance.
