# Artificial menisco tibial joint.

## Abstract
This invention relates to an artificial menisco tibial joint for a knee joint prosthesis of the kind which comprises at least one tibial component 1 on which the meniscus 6,6 is movably disposed. The meniscus 6,6 has a largely flat sliding surface against the tibial condyle which is provided with steering means 9,14 which impart to the meniscus 6,6 an ability to move in all directions along the tibial condyle, the steering means 9,14 also being so disposed that they limit the magnitude of the movement. The steering means 9,14 consist preferably of two locating pins 9 situated at a distance from each other which interact each with its own running track 7 in the tibial condyle so that the meniscus 6 , apart from a movement largely forwards and rearwards along the tibial condyle, is also imparted a sideways movement. Alternatively the steering means 9,14 consist of a posterior edge 14 on the metal socket 5 attached to the tibia 1 .
