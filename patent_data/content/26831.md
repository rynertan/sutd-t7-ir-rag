# Bar code printing device.

## Abstract
Herein disclosed is a printing device for printing such bar codes as can be automatically read in all directions by means of an optical reader. The printing device inclu des a printing head 10 which is operated with respect to the body of the printing device. Further inclusive are a plurality of bar code type rings 17 provided in said print ing head and juxtaposed in alignment with one another such that they can rotate independently of one another. The bar code type rings 17 are manually brought apart from one another during the type selecting operations and into close contact with one another during the type print ing operations. Further inclusive is a stopper 1 which is adapted to protrude out of the casing of the printing head 10 only during the type selecting operations by the ac tions of the selecting shaft 29 thereby to cause obstruc tion to the type printing operations.
