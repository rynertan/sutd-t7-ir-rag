# 1 Olefin polymerization and catalyst for 1 olefin polymerization.

## Abstract
In the polymerization of I olefins using a solid catalyst component composed of a titanium halide deposited on an essentially anhydrous, magnesium halide support and an activator component composed of a trialkylaluminum and a lower alkyl ester of an aromatic carboxylic acid, the decay in activity of the catalyst is delayed by replacing a portion of the trialkylaluminum in the activator component with a dial kylaluminum hydride, whereby to provide a mole ratio of total aluminum to ester of from 3 1 to 4 1 and a mole ratio of dialkylaluminum hydride to ester of from 0.5 1 to 1.5 1.
