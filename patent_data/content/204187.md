# Improved erosive jet diver tool.

## Abstract
An erosive fluid jet tool for underwater operation, comprising an erosive fluid jet nozzle connected to a fluid receiver receiving fluid under elevated pressure for provid ing hydraulic power to the tool, the nozzle providing the working output jet of the tool and a counterthruster for providing a counterthrusting force for balancing the thrust on the tool produced by the erosive fluid jet,the counter thruster including a a counterthrusting fluid jet nozzle connected to the fluid receiver and facing oppositely to the erosive nozzle for providing a counterthrusting jet, and b an open ended shround coaxially surrounding the counterthrust ing nozzle, whereby water surrounding the submerged tool is entrained through the shroud for providing additional counterthrusting force during operation of the counterthrust ing nozzle, the erosive fluid jet nozzle and the counterthruster being constructed so that in excess of 50 of the hydraulic power provided to the tool is provided to the erosive fluid jet nozzle.
