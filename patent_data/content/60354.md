# Method of treating coal to remove sulphur and ash.

## Abstract
The present invention is directed to an improved me thod of chemically treating coal to remove sulfur and ash. It is especially adapted for use on high sulfur, refuse coal. In practice the coal is treated with hydrochloric acid and hypochlorous acid in the presence of ferric and ferrous sulfate to convert the iron pyrites to other sulfur compounds. These are then converted to various salts of calcium through neutralization with lime.

## Description
There exists in the United States a large quantity of coal which cannot be economically used as a fuel because of its high sulfur content. Environmental laws are such that it is economically unfeasible to burn a high sulfur content coal because of the expensive antipollution equipment required. High sulfur coal, i.e., about 3 , exists in unmined form and also in the form of already mined coal that has been discarded, i.e., refuse coal. Refuse coal usually consists of fines which result from the processing of coal. More particularly, when coal is mined it is normally crushed and washed and the washings are generally dumped and used as land fill or dumped into a lake or stream. In the latter case, over a period of time, the pond or stream becomes almost completey filled with the finely powdered coal. Not only is this a significant waste of coal but it is injurious to the lakes and streams.Many lakes have become dead lakes due to this disposal of waste coal. The ash content of such refuse coa , i.e., above 20 by weight, also makes it economically irnattractive to attempt to utilize it. There also exist in ne United States subs antial deposits of unmined or virgin coal having a high sulfur content. In order to burn such coal in industry it would be necessary to spend substantial amounts of roIley for air pollution equipmentTherefore, this high sulfur content coa is not being mined. The need to effectively utilize energy while at the same time protecting our environment aces any other inaustrses as well, the steel industry being another example. The disposal of waste materials from steel making processes in an economically feasible, environmentally suitable manner is frequently a significant problem. For example, in the processing of steel an acid solution pickle liquor is used to treat the product. The resultant solution consisting of acid, iron compounds, contaminants, etc. collectively referred to hereinafter as spent pickle liquor must be disposed of. The present invention is applicable to high sulfur, high ash refuse or virgin coal. In one form of the present process, coal, crushed to about 1 4 by 0 size is first treated with spent pickle liquor. Thereafter it is subjected to a strong acidic oxidizing agent. More particularly, the acidified coal mixture is treated with a mixture of chlorine gas dissolved in water. Thereafter coal and ash are separated.through the use of water and gravity. Following this, the acid solution remaining is treated with lime and the precipitate which contains various sulfur compounds is discarded.These sulfur compounds exist in such a state that they are not injurious to our environment when discarded and in fact have a beneficial effect on dead lakesIn an aiLernative torm ot ths present invention only a minor amount of water is added to the pulverized coal, preferably in the form of steam, and the mixture is treated with chlorine gas. The process of this invention can be effectively practiced on any high sulfur content coal. In its most useful application it is practiced on refuse coal that at the present time has no utility. After treatment the refuse coal contains less than about 19 sulfur, has about 5 6 ash, has about 14,00014,500 btu per pound, and is processed into easily handled pellets. In contrast, before processing the refuse coal typically contains 2 3 sulfur, 25 30 ash and has a btu context of only 7,500. Refuse coal is produced as the result of normal coal mining operations and exists as a result of coal being crushed and washed. Typically it is 1 4 by 0, that is 1 4 inch down tc 325 mesh in size. Typically it is discarded as land fill or thrown into a pond, lake or stream. In some instances as much as 20 by weight of the mined coal ends up in the form of heretofore unusable refuse coal. Various areas of the United States contain large deposits of coal which are basically unusable because of the hih sulfur content of the coal. The present process is applicable also to such coal. The only modification required is to pulverize the coal so that it is about 1 4 by 0 as in the case of refuse coal. In the practice of the process the pulverized coal is first mixed with spent pickle liquor. In the manufacture of iron or steel it is customary to use a pickling acid to remove scale, rust, etc. Most frequently 600 Be sulfuric acid is employed and this is the preferred form for use. in the present invention although other acid pickle liquors may be employed. After use, the spent pickle liquor comprising the acid and various iron compounds such as Fe2 SO4 3, FeSO4 7H2O and other contaminants must be disposed of. Obviously, the disposal of such a liquid poses a significant problem from an environmental standpoint. For some unknown reason the use of spent pickle liquor produces superior results than if the acid itself is used. While it is not completely understood, it is believed that the iron salts present in the spent pickle liquor have a significant effect on the reaction rate. If only uncontaminated H2SO4 is used, the final results in many cases in terms of sulfur removal are inferior and the speed of the reaction is decreased. Moreover, the ability to convert a material that poses such an environmental risk to a safe, useful material able to benefit the environment is an advantage not to be taken lightly. While it is preferred to use spent pickle liquor the acid in unused form may be utilized recognizing, of course, that under some conditions inferior results may be obtained. The amount of spent pickle liquor mixed with the pulverized coal is somewhat dependent on the sulfur content of the coal. Usually though 2 pickle liquor based on the weight of the coal is sufficient. It is important to allow the pickle liquor to contact the coal for a brief period of time prior to further processing.In practice 5 10 minutes has been found to be satisfactory.Thereafter, the mixture is introduced into any suitable type of reactor mixer and mixed with about 20 by weight of water.Preferably the water temperature and temperature of the mixture is 80 90 F. This may require suitable heating or cooling means of conventional design. Into the reactor mixer is introduced chlorine gas. The amount of chlorine required is an amount sufficient to provide a mixture having a pH of about 3 or less. When mixed with the water the chlorine gas provides hydrochlorlo acid, hypochlorous acid and nascent oxygen. While it is not completely understood, it is believed that the iron disulphide iron pyrite which is present in tne coal and which forms the major sulfur containing material is cor verted into the following iron and sulfur compounds through the following reactions FeS2 2HOCl FeS . 2HC1 SO2 FeS 2HCl FeC12 H2S 2HOC1 i SO2 . 2HCl S02 H20 H2SO3 H2S03 HOC1 H2SO4 HCl After the reaction is essentially complete, the ash and coal that are present can be mechanically separated from each other and from the acid solution.One convenient way for doing so consists of introducing the entire mixture into a conically shaped separator of conventional design, where provision is made at the bottom for introducing water. At the top a wier is provided such that material at the surface of the mixture will be transferred out of the separator and into a discharge conduit. The denser, heavier coal particles fall to the bottom and are discharged through an outlet. The coal is then dried and preferably pelletized. To To the liquid and water material overflowing the separation is added a sufficient amount of lime to precipitate most of the sulfur as calcium salts, i.e., CaSO3, CaS, CaSO4 or other salts of calcium containing sulfur. The amount of lime required is that amount which is required to provide a neutral or nearly neutral pH. Such precipitated salts are thereafter separated and preferably used as fill in coal slurry ponds. If the ponds are not totally filled but if a sufficient amount of the precipitate is added over a relatively short period of time the pond is once again capable of supporting life. The coal so recovered has less than 6 ash, less than 1 sulfur and a btu content of about 14,000 per pound. The economics of the process are such that refuse coal may be economically reclaimed to provide an excellent energy source. In the alternative form of the present invention, to the pulverized coal is added a minor amount of water, preferably in the form of steam. The water added is preferably an amount equal to about 10 20 by weight of the coal. Thereafter, to the mixture is added chlorine gas. Unlike the previous embodiment the chlorine gas is not dissolved in water nor is pickle liquor added to the mixture. Also, the amount of water required is reduced. As in the previous embodiment, the mixture after treat ment with the chlorine gas is subjected to the separation step and thereafter to the neutralization step.
