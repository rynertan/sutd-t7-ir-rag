# Fluid coupling device comprising a bimetal coil mounting arrangement.

## Abstract
A fluid coupling device is disclosed of the type including a valve member 29 actuated by a valve shaft 39 extending through the cover 27 , the position of the valve and valve shaft being controlled by a temperature responsive bimetal coil 43 . The coil has a first end 45 attached to the valve shaft and a second end free end 47 received within a receiving portion 55 of a clip member 53 . Disposed bet ween the second end of the coil and the receiving portion of the clipmember is a resilient elastomeric member 61 hav ing a relatively thin wall. The clip member includes at least one wing portion 57,59 which is attached to the cover to define an enclosure. The enclosure is configured to engage the elastomeric member which is compressed against the second end portion of the coil on at least two sides. The elastomeric member fills the clearance between the coil and the clip, even if the thickness of the clearance is not uniform, to increase the coefficient of frction, and the total gripping force, between the clip and coil. At the same time, the resiliency of the elastomeric member prevents the gripping of the coil by the clip from being too rigid, in cases where the fit therebetween is extremely close.
