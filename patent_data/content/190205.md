## Description
This invention relates to a method of detecting or determining a sequence of monomer molecules which corresponds to an epitope on an antigen, or which has the equivalent molecular topology to that epitope. As used throughout this specification, the terms listed below have the following meanings It is already well known that It is a primary object of the present invention to detect or determine the one or more short sequences of monomers which equate with an epitope of an antigen, such that these sequences can combine with the same antibody as the epitope. These catamers would be the mimotopes of the epitope. This information is invaluable in the design of synthetic catamer vaccines against diseases and for the design of very specific diagnostic and therapeutic agents. The most usual group of small molecules which may be condensed together to form a catamer is the group of alpha amino acids. However, other molecules which are consistent with the chemistry chosen may be used. For example, beta amino acids may be used with advantage to add an extra C bond spacer at precisely controlled positions in the catamer. PNAS, 81 1984 , p3998 4002 discloses a procedure for the rapid synthesis of hundreds of short peptides derived from the known sequence of FMDV type O₁. These peptides can then be screened for immunogenicity. EMBO journal, Vol 3, no. 6, 1984 p1295 1300 discloses the characterization of the epitope of the rat monoclonal antibody YL 1 2. This characterization is carried out using synthetic peptides spanning the carboxy terminus of tyrosinated α tubulin. According to the present invention there is provided a method of determing the sequence of monomers selected from a defined set of monomers which is a conformational equivalent of an epitope which is complementary to a particular paratope of an antibody of interest, the method comprising the steps of Preferably, the method also comprises the further steps of The procedures of steps v and vi may be repeated until all positions in each catamer preparation have been designated and all deduced mimotopes may then be synthesised to determine from their relative ability to react with the antibody of interest which are the better mimotopes for the epitope corresponding to this given antibody. The method of the present invention is based on the realisation that a given antibody will specifically react with a catamer which is the mimotope of the epitope to which the antibody is directed. It further relies on the knowledge that modern techniques of immunology allow the detection of reactions between an antibody and its epitope when both are present in very small amounts. Binding has been detected when an antibody and its epitope are present in amounts of about 1 pmole. Thus, if an antibody is presented with a mixture of catamers, amongst which is a mimotope to its epitope then it will be seen to react with the mixture, binding specifically to the mimotope. The identity of mimotopes is deduced from the known monomer composition at the designated positions of reacting catamer preparations. A complete mimotope would be expected to be some combination of the reacting components deduced in this way. It will be apparent that the method of this invention requires no previous information about the nature of the antigen and in particular it requires no foreknowledge of the sequence of monomers which make up the antigen. In fact, it is not necessary for the application of this invention to know the source or the identity of the antigen to which the antibody is directed. Furthermore, this invention makes no assumptions about the epitope which stimulated the production of the particular antibody. This method will identify mimotopes of discontinuous as well as continuous epitopes. Because of the very nature of the method of the invention it will be appreciated that it applies to any antigen, which in part or in total is non proteinaceous, whose epitopes can be mimicked by a suitable catamer. Mimotopes may or may not be made from members of the same set of monomers which make up the antigen. Preferably the method of the present invention is carried out by screening a plurality of synthesized catamer preparations against an antibody of interest. Ideally the antibody will be a monoclonal antibody which can be prepared by any of the usual methods. Polyclonal antiserum from humans and animals may be used if a source of monoclonal antibody is not available, however, analysis of the resulting data may be complicated because the reactions observed could be from more than one monoclonal antibody. When using polyclonal antiserum it may be necessary to reduce the antibody diversity by using techniques well known to those skilled in the art, for example iso electric focusing, HPLC based chromatography or affinity chromatography. Current indications suggest that an epitope can be mimicked by a catamer which is about eight monomers in length when the monomers come from the set of alpha amino acids. The ability of the 8 catamer to be the mimotope of the epitope is not critically dependent on every position having a particular monomer. It is to be understood, however, that the present invention is not restricted to sequences formed from eight monomers. The plurality of catamer preparations required to be synthesized in the application of this invention may be prepared by any of the known methods of catamer synthesis. The preferred method when the monomers are amino acids is to use the solid phase technique described in Australian Patent Specification No. 25429 84, whereby each mixture of catamers is synthesized on a polyethylene support. The following is a detailed description of one embodiment of the present invention As noted above, the preferred method of applying this invention is to synthesize the catamers on a solid support. In this embodiment, the plurality of catamers will all have the general formula If i is the number of members in the set of monomers to be coupled in the D₁ position and j is the number of members in the set of monomers to be coupled in the D₂ position then a total of i.j different catamer preparations will be synthesized. In the present embodiment, the support rods are prepared so that the monomers can be coupled to them. The rods are then exposed to the reaction mixture containing each member of the set of monomers being considered. This will couple monomers at the first X position. This process is repeated thrice to give the catamer Z X X X X solid support where Z is the protective group appropriate to the set of monomers being considered examples of Z where the monomers are amino acids include the BOC and Fmoc groups. Up to this stage in the performance of the method all rods have been treated in an identical manner. For the coupling at the D₁ position each rod will be treated with a reaction mixture which contains only a single monomer such as a protected amino acid or the like. In the D₁ position each of the i monomers will be coupled to j rods. For the coupling at the D₂ position each rod is again treated with a reaction mixture containing only a single monomer such as a protected amino acid or the like. Each of the j rods which has a particular monomer in the D₁ position will have a different monomer coupled at the D₂ position. In this way every combination of the members of the set s of monomers will be found in the i.j rods. Coupling of monomers in the remaining X positions is identical to the coupling in the X positions closer to the solid support. After synthesis of the plurality of catamer preparations any side chain protective groups are removed from the catamer preparations using the usual techniques and the rod coupled catamers are washed. It has been found to be a preferred embodiment of the invention to synthesize more than one set of pluralities of catamer preparations to aid in the analysis of data. Thus, as well as synthesizing catamers with the general formula The plurality of catamer preparations prepared as in A above are then contacted with the particular antibody of interest. The reaction between antibody and components of the catamer preparations can then be detected by any of the usual methods, for example Radioimmunoassay RIA . However, the preferred method of detection of the presence of antibody mimotope binding is to use the well known enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA . At the end of each assay antibodies can be removed from the catamer preparations by, for example, washing with a solution of 8M urea, 0.1 2 mercaptoethanol and 0.1 sodium dodecylsulphate followed by several washes in phosphate buffered saline. In this way the plurality of catamer preparations may be used for testing with many other antibodies. In the testing of the catamer preparations with antibody it will be found that certain rods will show detectable binding with the antibody. The catamer preparation coupled to such a reacting rod contains a defined combination of the members of the set s of monomers in positions D₁ and D₂. This combination of monomers is likely to form part of the catamer which makes up a mimotope for the epitope which is complementary to the antibody. Further analysis of the data can be carried out in a number of ways. These include The selected mimotopes can then be synthesized using similar methods to those described in Australian Patent Specification No. 25429 84. After the selected catamers have been synthesized they are reacted with the antibody of interest. It is then simple to select the catamer which binds most strongly with the antibody. As a final check that this catamer is the best mimotope of the epitope, the sequence of the catamer may be used as the parent sequence of a replacement net as described in Australian Patent Specification No. 25428 84. In Examples 1, 2 and 3 given below, the defined set of monomers is the set of the common L alpha amino acids. This set of monomers is used for both the designated positions and the random positions positions D₁ , D₂ and X as used in the general formulae above . Furthermore, in these examples, the end group of the catamers the Y group was the acetyl moiety. A plurality of 8 catamer preparations was synthesized with the general formula Members of the set of common L amino acids were coupled in the X positions in the following way Individual L amino acids were coupled in the D₁ and D₂ positions by the method described in Australian Patent Specification No. 25429 84. This resulted in the synthesis of 400 catamer preparations, comprising all possible pairings of the 20 common amino acids at the D₁ and D₂ positions. The plurality of 8 catamer preparations were tested against a monoclonal antibody by ELISA. This monoclonal antibody was prepared against Foot and Mouth Disease Virus FMDV subtype A₁₀ using techniques well known to those skilled in the art. In performing the ELISA assay support coupled peptides were incubated in a precoat solution of 1 ovalbumin 1 bovine serum albumin 0.1 Tween 20 in phosphate buffered saline PBS for 1 hr at 25 C to block non specific absorption of antibodies. Overnight incubation at 4 C in a suitable dilution of monoclonal antibody in precoat solution was followed by three washes in 0.05 Tween 20 PBS. Reaction for 1 hr at 25 C with goat anti mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, diluted in the precoat solution, was again followed by extensive washing with PBS Tween to remove excess conjugate. The presence of antibody was detected by reaction for 45 min with a freshly prepared enzyme substrate solution 40mg of o phenylenediamine and 18µl of 120 vol. hydrogen peroxide in 100ml of phosphate citrate buffer, pH 5.0 , and the colour produced determined at 450nm. Figure 1 shows the result of testing the 8 catamer preparations with this antibody. In Figure 1, each group of twenty lines represents the response in an ELISA in units of absorbancy of the colour developed when measured at 450nm. Each member of the group of twenty lines has a common amino acid in the D₁ position which is given in single letter code immediately below each group. Each member of a group of twenty lines represents a different amino acid in the D₂ position these are in alphabetical order of their single letter code. The results are summarised in Table 1. In Table 1, and throughout the remainder of the Examples, the single letter code for amino acids will be used. It will be seen that the antibody reacts strongly with a number of 8 catamer preparations. In order of strength of reaction, these include 8 catamer preparations in which the designated positions D₂ D₁ are M H , M K , K K , K H , Q H and H H . Two further pluralities of 8 catamer preparations were synthesized. These had the formulae These 8 catamer preparations were tested against the monoclonal antibody against FMDV A₁₀. Figures 2A and 2B show the results of ELISA testing with the monoclonal antibody used to produce the results shown in Figure 1. Figure 2A represents 8 catamer preparations with the general formula It will be seen that the 8 catamer preparations which gave the greatest reactions with the monoclonal antibody had the following sequences in the designated positions H M K , W M K , and Q M K in Figure 2A and M K H , M K Q and M K W in Figure 2B. Incorporation of histidine at either side of the M K defined pair resulted in the greatest antibody binding activity. However histidine at the amino terminal side was not significantly better than tryptophan, and the defined sequence W M K H was selected for further evaluation. The validity of proceeding with the defined sequence W M K H, predicted to be optimal by combining the individual preferred extensions to the pair M K, was tested. Catamer preparations based on the parent sequence of Acetyl NH X W M K H X X X S 8 Catamer preparations with the general formulae In order to confirm the specificity of the antibody binding reaction of the determined group of related peptides for the test Antibody titres for each Example 2 illustrates the application of the invention to a polyclonal antibody. A further plurality of 8 catamers was synthesized with the general formula The results of ELISA testing the plurality of 8 catamer preparations with the antibody are given in Figure 3 in the same manner as in Figure 1. It will be seen that all 8 catamer preparations which had E glutamic acid in the D₁ position reacted significantly with antibody. Other combinations which reacted significantly with antibody include in decreasing order D I , G D , I G , and D V . As described in Example 1 above, further pluralities of 8 catamer preparations were synthesized with the formulae Figure 4 shows that 8 catamer preparations which react with antibody include the following sequences in the designated positions G D I , A D I , P D I , D I D , D I M and D I T . It can plainly be seen by comparing Figure 4A with Figure 4B that the position immediately before the D I pair permits far less latitude in allowable amino acids than does the position immediately after the D I pair. 8 Catamer preparations based on the parent sequence Extending the defined sequence above demonstrated the preference for incorporation of tryptophan at the amino terminal end and histidine at the carboxyl terminal end. However, neither extension produced a very marked increase in the antibody binding activity. Further extension of the preferred defined sequence W G D I S H showed that there was little advantage in extending the sequence further. It will be noted that the mimotope determined for this particular antibody, namely, W G D I S H has only a passing similarity to the peptide which was used to induce the antibody, namely, C G D L G S I A K. However, testing of the antibody in a replacement net based on the immunogenic sequence G D L G S I showed a marked preference for the sequence G D L G D I rather than the inducing sequence G D L G S I E₄₅₀ values 0.45 and 0.16 respectively . There is a similarity between the mimotope as determined and a preferred binding peptide for the antibody. This is strong evidence for the broad applicability of the method. Example 3 illustrates that the length of the plurality of catamer preparations can be shorter than 8 catamers. A plurality of 4 catamer preparations was synthesized with the general formula The results of ELISA testing the plurality of 4 catamer preparations with the antibody are given in Figure 5 in the same manner as in Figure 1. It will be seen that only the catamer preparations with the formula As described in Example 1 above, further pluralities of 4 catamer preparations were synthesized with the formulae Catamer preparations based on the parent sequence A set of all overlapping 4 catamers of the sperm whale myoglobin sequence was synthesized using the methods described for the designated positions in Example 1. These catamers were reacted in an ELISA with the monoclonal antibody. The results are shown in Figure 7. Each line represents the colour developed in an ELISA, read at 450nm. Each line is numbered so that the residue at the amino terminal end of the particular catamer has the same number as in the sperm whale myoglobin sequence. It can clearly be seen that the only 4 catamer which reacts with the monoclonal antibody is that comprising residues 88 to 91 of the sperm whale sequence. This sequence is P L A Q. Clearly, the monoclonal antibody recognizes this particular determinant on the sperm whale myoglobin. A set of 5 catamers with the general formulae It should be noted that the sequence K P L A Q is homologous with the sequence of sperm whale myoglobin at residues 87 to 91. Again, this example illustrates the applicability of this technique.
