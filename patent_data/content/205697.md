## Description
Apparatus for Cleaning a Submerged Surface and Method of moving such Apparatus over the Surface This invention relates to apparatus for cleaning a surface submerged in a liquid. It also relates to a method of moving the apparatus over the submerged surface. Submerged cleaners which define a flow path between a main inlet and an outlet and which have a flapper valve adapted periodically to vary the rate of flow of a liquid in the flow path are known.The oscillatory operation of the valve causes the rate of flow in the path to vary so that kinetic energy is transferred from the liquid to the cleaner as a result of which the cleaner is displaced along the wall or floor of the swimming pool, for example. A disadvantage of the known cleaners is that the flow path thereof is not an open and unobstructed one, but one obstructed by the oscillatory valve.The valve is also often rendered inoperative by grass, leaves or other suspended matter jamming the oscillatory operation thereof. It is accordingly an object of the present invention to provide a submerged cleaner with which the above disadvantage will at least be alleviated. According to the invention there is provided apparatus for cleaning a surface submerged in a liquid which includes a head portion having an inlet and an outlet and defining a first flow path between the inlet and t he outlet the outlet being adapted to be coupled to a suction source the apparatus being characterised in that it defines an auxiliary inlet at a point intermediate the first inlet and the suction source with the auxiliary inlet communicating with the first flow path and being further characterised in that the apparatus includes valve means for varying the flow rate through one of the inlets thereby indirectly varying the rate of flow through the other inlet.According to one aspect of the invention the valve means is adapted periodically to interrupt or vary flow through the auxiliary inlet thereby varying flow through the first inlet and the first flow path.The valve means may be biassed to an open condition and adapted to be urged to a closed condition under the influence of flow through the valve.The apparatus may also comprise a tube defining an auxiliary flow path of suitable length which is in communication with the first flow path via the auxiliary inlet.The rate of flow through the auxiliary inlet in this embodiment may also be varied by providing an aperture in the tube by means of which the auxiliary flow path communicates with the exterior and then opening and closing the aperture or varying its size.In another embodiment the tube may define a plurality of auxiliary flow paths communicating with the first flow path via the auxiliary inlet, the valve means may comprise a pivotally mounted closure element adapted to oscillate between valve seats thereby switching the flow from one of the auxiliary flow paths to the other. In particular when the auxiliary flow path is divided in two flow paths, the valve means may be adapted periodically to switch the flow from one of these paths to the other.The tube may also communicate with the first now path via an aperture upstream from the auxiliary inlet, the auxiliary flow path thereby constituting a bypass for the first flow path.The first flow path preferably is an open path, has a substantially uniform bore along the length thereof and is substantially free of any obstructions.The head and the tube constituting the auxiliary flow path are preferably made from a suitable rigid material such as polycarbonate or PVC.According to another aspect of the invention the valve means is adapted periodically to interrupt or vary flow through the first flow path and the first inlet, thereby varying the flow through the auxiliary inlet.Further according to this aspect of the invention the vaive means is in the form of a diaphragm, the diaphragm being arranged so that it defines a venturi type orifice.The diaphragm is biassed to maximising the cross sectional area of the venturi type orifice. In the preferred form the diaphragm comprises a resilient material and the outer surface of the diaphragm is in communication with ambient pressure via an aperture in the first flow path.The apparatus according to this aspect of the invention may include a tube defining an auxiliary flow path communicating with ambient pressure through a first opening defined in the tube the auxiliary flow path also communicating with the first flow path through the auxiliary inlet defined in the head and a second opening defined in the tube the outer surface of the diaphragm communicating with ambient pressure through a further opening defined in the head, the opening in the head communicating with a third opening defined in the tube.The present invention also extends to a method of moving the apparatus as defined hereabove over a submerged surface through transference of kinetic energy. The method comprises the steps of causing fluid to flow along the first flow path and through the auxiliary inlet by applying suction to the apparatus varying the flow through one of the inlets thereby indirectly varyig the flow through the other inlet whereby kinetic energy is transferred from the fluid to the apparatus.The invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which figures I to 5 show schematic section views of various embodiments of an apparatus for automatically cleaning the walls and floor of a swimming pool.Referring to figure I, a first embodiment of an apparatus for cleaning the wall or floor of a swimming pool is shown, therein designated generally by reference numeral IO.I. The apparatus IO.I has a head portion 12 which is of a rigid material and defines a linear main flow path 14 therethrough. At one end I6, a swivel coupling I8 engages the head portion 12. A flexible suction hose 20 is connected to the apparatus IO.I by means of the coupling I8. The end 16 also defines an outlet 22 for the main flow path 14. At its other end 24, the head portion 12 defines a first inlet 26 which is engageable with the wall or floor of the swimming pool not shown . A flexible disc 28 is engaged with the head portion 12 at its end 24 to facilitate in maintaining the apparatus IO.I in engagement with the wall or floor. Within the head portion I2, close to its inlet 26 there are restricting formations 30 to define a restriction 32. Close to its outlet 22 an auxiliary inlet 34 is defined in the head portion 12. This inlet is of more or less the same size as the restriction 32. A suitable spring loaded valve 36 is provided which is biassed to an open condition and which in use automatically opens and closes when suction is applied to the apparatus IO.I by the suction source not shown via the hose 20. With the valve 36 in its open condition water flows through the auxiliary inlet 36 to join the flow of water in the main flow path 14 on its way to the suction source not shown . The flow of water past the valve head 36b creates a drop in pressure in the region of the inlet thereby creating a bigger pressure differential across the valve head 36b. Due to this increased pressure differential the valve head 36 will move towards the associated valve seat 36c and will close the auxiliary inlet 34 causing the flow of water in the region of the inlet 34 to stop.As a result of this stoppage, the pressure differential will decrease enabling the spring 36a, having a suitable resilience, to force the valve head 36b away from the seat 36c thereby opening the auxiliary inlet 34 for water to enter again through the auxiliary inlet 34. As the vaive 36 periodically opens and closes, the rate of flow of water through the main flow path 14 varies so that kinetic energy is transferred from the water to the apparatus IO.I causing it to be displaced along the wall or floor of the swimming pool. Referring now to figure 2, a further embodiment 10.2 of the apparatus is shown. The apparatus 10.2 is similar to the apparatus IO.I of figure I and is similarly numbered. However, in this embodiment 10.2, the auxiliary inlet 34 does not communicate directly with the exterior, but via a tube defining auxiliary flow path 38. At its end remote from the auxiliary inlet the tube has the valve 36 similar to and operating in a manner similar to the valve 36 of embodiment IO.I. As the valve 36 periodically opens and closes the rate of flow of water in the auxiliary flow path 38 varies causing the rate of flow in the main flow path 14 to vary so that kinetic energy is transferred from the water to the apparatus 10.2 as a result of which the apparatus 10.2 is displaced along the wall or floor of the swimming pool. Referring now to figure 3, the embodiment Io.3 of the apparatus shown therein is similar to that of figure 2 and is similarly numbered. However, in the embodiment It.3 the free end of the tube is V shaped and seated therein is a flapper valve 40 which oscillates netween suitabie valve seats, one on either side of the V , when water is sucked through the auxiliary path 38. As the valve 40 oscillates the rate of flow of water in the auxiliary flow path 38 varies causing the rate of flow in the main flow path 14 also to vary so that kinetic energy is transferred from the water to the apparatus 10.3 as a result of which the apparatus 10.3 is displaced along the wall or floor of the swimming pool. Referring to figure 4, the embodiment Io.4 shown therein has a main flow Wpath 14 and an auxiliary flow path 42 in the form of a bypass. At one end, the auxiliary flow path communicates with the main flow path 14 via an aperture 44 which is close to the inlet opening 26 and at its other end via a down stream aperture 46. Within the auxiliary flow path there is located a spring loaded valve 48 which automatically opens and closes when water is sucked through the auxiliary flow path 42.The vaive 48 operates in a manner similar to the valve 36 in embodiments IO.I and iso.2. The flow of water past valve head 48b creates a pressure drop on the downstream side thereof, thereby creating a bigger pressure differential across the valve. Due to this increased pressure differential the valve head 48b pivots towards its seat 48c and closes the auxiliary flow path 42 thereby stopping the flow of water through the auxiliary flow path 42. The resilience of spring 48a is such that the spring will pull valve head 48b away from its seat 48e to open the valve 48 upon the pressure on the down stream side of valve 48 having risen again due to the water being stationary in the auxiliary flow path 42. As valve 48 periodically opens and closes, the rate of flow of water through the flow path 14 varies so that kinetic energy is transferred from the water to the apparatus Io.4 causing it to be displaced along the wail or floor of the swimming pool. Referring now to figure 5, yet a further embodiment 10.5 of the apparatus is shown. The embodiment shown has a main flow path 14 and an auxiliary flow path 50 communicating with the main flow path 14 via aperture 52 and aperture 53, downstream from aperture 52. Diaphragm valve 54 which defines a venturi type orifice 55 is located within the main flow path 14 with the outer surface of the diaphragm 34b communicating with ambient pressure via aperture 52. With suction applied to the hose 20, water flows through both the auxiliary flow path 50 and through the open valve 54 in the main flow path 14 in the direction of end I6 of the head portion 12. The flow of water through the venturi type orifice 55 creates a pressure drop within the tubular diaphragm 34b causing the diaphragm 54b to close thereby stopping the flow of water through the main flow path 14. The rate of flow through the auxiliary flow path 50 and through aperture 53 now increases and the pressure differential between the inside and outside of the diaphragm 54 decreases so that the orifice 55 is opened again under the influence of the resilience of the diaphragm 34b. As vaive 54 periodically opens and closes, the rates of flow of water through the main flow path 14 and the auxiliary flow path 50 vary so that kinetic energy is transferred from the water to the apparatus I0.5 causing it to be displaced along the wall or floor of the swimming pool.Many variations in detail of the apparatus according to the present invention are possible without departing from the spirit of the invention.For example, the auxiliary inlet with its associated valve may be located in the hose 20 at a position downstream from the end I6 of the head portion 12.
