# Process for producing wet strength agents for paper.

## Abstract
Process of producing quaternary ammonium com pounds from tertiary amines, without the use of epihalohyd rin as the quaternization agent, comprising reacting an amino compound containing at least one tertiary amine group with an allyl halide to quaternize the amine and then reacting the quaternized product with hypohalous acid to convert the allyl substituents to halohydrin moieties.
