# Alimentary product for preparing meats ready for cooking.

## Abstract
The initially moistened meat is directly breaded with a granular compound employing meal, eggs, salt, grated bread and natural flavours. For manufacturing the compounds supplied by servers arrive on the line to a mixer amalgamating the product and putting it into a kneading machine and subsequently into a drying chamber. A compound is resulting prepared for prompt employ and for a long preservation.

## Claims
CLAIMS 1 Alimentary product for meat breading as cooking preparation, characterized by the fact that it permits to replace the paste preparation for breading as used at present as well as the relevant operation phases with a granular compoundith a high hygroscopic action, apt to be packed for a long preservat ion and permitting a prompt employ. As base components are used soft wheat meal, hen eggs,salt, grated bread and na tural flavours The manufacturing proceeding foresees the inl et from servers of the components which, on the line, reach a mixer amalgamating the product then it passes to a kneadi ng machine and subsequently to a drying device. After having opened the packing, the user pours the required product into a container, moistens the meat with water and lets it pass in to the compound. The contact with the meat moist wall transforms the compound from the anhydrous state into the humid doughy one, bringing it to adhere as a layer on the meat.

## Description
Alimentary product for preparing meats ready for cooking .The invention refers to a granular compound to be manufactured for a long preservation, which substantially allows the prompt employ for directly breading meat in general previou sly moistened with water, making it ready for cooking. The meat breading, by means of conglobing it in a layer envelop, permits to preserve its natural features and to add the fla vour of the enveloping paste to its own one.At present, the user must separately prepare the mixture for dipping, which gives relish to the paste and acts as a conglo bating means, and the breaded product allows the moist layer envelope. For this purpose, the mixture is at present prepa red with eggs, cheese, salt, natural flavours, with addition of fresh vegetables, if required, or dried or dishydrated o nes. These components are subsequently poured into a container, mixed up and amalgamated. The breading product consists of me al or chipped bread. The meat is then completely submerged in to the mixture and passed into the breading product.The foods thus obtained are then fried in oil, either animal or vegetal butter or derivates. The invention avoids the pre paration of the compounds for the paste dipping mixture and breading product , as well as the breading according to diffe rent operation phases, the employ of the base compounds for the paste as used at present remaining still the same, which condition ensures the genuineness of the product. This is allowed by the crcumstance that a granular product is used pre pared with both the dipping and the breading mixtures allowing a prompt employ and a long preservation in store. The base composition employs soft wheat meal, hen eggs, salt, chipped bread and natural flavours. The base manufacturing process fo resees the separate input by means of servers of the base com ponents in the manufacturing line, which lets them into a mi xer.The mixture can be differently carried out according to well known proceedings with hot water or at the room temperature, or by introducing water steam. In this way, the product amal gam is obtained. The paste thus obtained is passed through a kneading machine letting the still moist but already made product formed into grains.At the cycle end, the compound is passed into a drying chamber enabling its stabilization and drying, bringing it to a humidity content from 10 to 12 . This permits a preservability in store for a long time similarly to that of the dry pastes.The product allows employ particularities for home use, con cern tables, overfrozen food manufactures and retail shops for meat and derivates. For the prompt employ, after having opened the packing, the user pours the product required by him into a container he then moistens the meat with water and passes it into the com pound. The water brought by the meat acts as a conglobating means of the compound and brings it from the granular state to the moist and doughy one of the type similar to that of the usual paste. The readiness of employ is possible thanks to the high hygroscopicity feature of the compound, which changes its physical state by absorbing water.The components may vary and be properly integrated with others in order to permit different flavours.Other manufacturing systems may be employed to permit to get otherwise the anhydrous product.Packing may be performed similarly according to the known means and forms.
