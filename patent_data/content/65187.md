# PLUG FOR CLOSING THE FORCEPS INLET OF AN ENDOSCOPE

## Abstract
An endoscope is provided with a forceps channel 40 , which is communicated with a forceps inlet 38 defined by a holder 24 on a control section 6 . A plug 26 is attached to the holder 24 to prevent liquid in the body cavity from leaking outside the forceps inlet 38 through the forceps channel 40 . The plug 26 is cap shaped and has a first portion fitted onto the holder 24 and a second portion for closing the forceps inlet 36 . The second portion is made thinner by forming a recess 54 through which operating tools such as forceps are penetrated.
