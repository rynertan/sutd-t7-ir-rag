# PULSE GENERATION CIRCUIT.

## Abstract
A pulse generation circuit which has a series circuit of a first switching element 3 or 13 and a second switching element 4 , a capacitance element 5 , and a third switching element 6 connected in series from the connection point of the first element and the second element, an amplification element 7 with input and output terminals connected to both ends of the capacitance element 5 , a fourth switching element 8 connected to the output terminal of the amplifi cation element 7 which supplies a first input signal varying in level to the control terminals of the first and third elements 3 or 13, 6 and a second input signal varying in level to the control terminals of the second and fourth elements 4, 8 , thereby obtaining a pulse signal of width corresponding to the time from a variation in the level of the first input signal to a variation in the level of the second input signal at the output terminal of the amplification element 7 .
