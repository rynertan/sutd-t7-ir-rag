# DIGITAL COLOR IMAGE TRANSFORMATION

## Abstract
A color transform enables color image information to be recorded, displayed and otherwise processed with exact ing control of color relative to a selected display. The trans form enables a single exposure photographic print of image information produced in pre press equipment to predict with accuracy an ink on paper print of that information. Color image information is transformed with a technique that produces output information for each output color com ponent or other parameter at each point in response to up to all input parameters at that point. The output information may include approximate transform values and finalizing values. The technique can be implemented for real time conversion with look up tables storing approximate trans form values and storing interpolation factors for computing finalizing values.
