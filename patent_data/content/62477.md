# Ultrasonic measuring apparatus.

## Abstract
Ultrasonic measuring apparatus has a probe including ul trasonic transducer elements 2 1, 2 1 , 2 2 capable of si multaneously transmitting or of simultaneously receiving ultra sonic beams of different frequencies f₁, f₂ . The apparatus provides for selective operation of transducer elements e.g. 2 1 and 2 2 operated together or 2 1,2 1 , 2 2 operated to gether to change the shape of an effective acoustic field of at least one of the beams e.g. the f₂ beam . Thereby effective acoustic fields of the beams of different frequencies can be caused to coincide over selected distance from the probe ranges.
