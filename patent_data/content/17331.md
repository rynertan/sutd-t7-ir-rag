# Improvements relating to hot chamber die casting.

## Abstract
A gooseneck assembly 10 for hot chamber die casting comprises a shot cylinder 12 , an injection duct 16 leading from the bottom of the cylinder to a die 18 , and a reservoir 20 which communicates with the shot cylinder through openings 22, 23 and 24 in a partition wall 21 . The upper ends of the shot cylinder and reservoir are closed and a protective atmosphere is maintained above a level 6A of molten metal in the assembly. The assembly is automatically recharged with molten metal from a separate crucible 3 through a syphon pipe 30 .
