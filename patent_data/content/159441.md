# MACHINE PISTOL WITH RETARDED BLOWBACK

## Abstract
A machine pistol includes means for retarding blow back of the slide assembly 100 . The pistol has both right hand and left hand stocks 12, 13 to enable the weapon to be fired from a comfortable visual sighting position at eye level with the wrist axes perpendicular to one another. The slide assembly 100 includes a bolt 110 which carries the firing pin 129 , extractor and elector and which reciprocates relative to the receiver 20 and barrel 60 , and a tubular cylindrical muzzle sleeve 140 releasably connected to the forward end of the bolt 110 and which fits coaxially around the barrel 60 . A coaxial helical spring 65 is provided between the barrel 60 and muzzle sleeve 140 to urge the muzzle sleeve and bolt to the forward firing position in which the forward end of the muzzle sleeve extends out wardly beyond the end of the barrel. A plurality of annular internal grooves 150 are formed in the forward end of the muzzle sleeve 140 so that the momentum of the escaping gases immediately following firing exerts a force against the sidewalls 152 of the grooves to retard blowback of the slide assembly 100 .
