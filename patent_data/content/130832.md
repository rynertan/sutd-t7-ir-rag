# A multispeed development system.

## Abstract
An apparatus in which a developer roller 40 transports developer material into contact with a photoconductive sur face 10 having either a continuous tone or a half tone latent electrostatic image recorded thereon. The speed of the devel oper roller is controlled so that it rotates at a higher speed when developing continuous tone latent images than when develop ing half tone latent images. In this way, development is opti mized for the respective type of image so as to produce high quality copies.
