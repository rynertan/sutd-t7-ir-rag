## Description
LATCH UP RESISTANT INTEGRATED CIRCUIT AND METHOD OF MANUFACTURE The present invention generally relates to integrated circuits having greatly improved resistance to the latch up phenomena. Metal oxide semiconductor technology has become one of the most rapidly expanding fields in the fabrication of integrated circuit devices. MOS field effect transistors MOSFET are a natural choice for digital applications because of their ON mode OFF mode method of operation. CMOS structures, having both channel and p channel devices available on the same chip, are particularly attractive because of their exceedingly low power dissipation and high packing density capabilities. Because in CMOS devices both n channel and p channel components are being built into the same ,substrate, Junction isolation is necessary for the device which is of the same conductivity type as the substrate. Basically, this is accomplished by providing wells in the substrate having a conductivity type opposite that of the substrate. The device of the same conductivity type as the substrate can be formed in such a well.For example, an n well is formed in a p type substrate where p channel devices are to be subsequently constructed. However, the use of such a structure forms parasitic bipolar transistors in the example, the p type substrate, the n well, and the subsequently embedded p doped regions of the p channel device form an undesirable pntype bipolar transistor. The combination of the two types of devices in such close proximity gives rise to mutual influence and tends to form silicon controlled rectifiers SCR , which can trigger the ON state of the devices when the integrated circuit s reference biasing voltage changes due to phenomenon such as temperature gradients, electrical noise pulses, or Ionizing radiation . Once triggered, the effect is to cause the circuit to latch up. Latclmup causes a CMOS integrated circuit to try to short out the power supply. To cure a latch up condition, the shorted power must be disconnected.The tendancy toward latch up increases with circuit density, hence, LSI andVLSI are difficult to achieve. The present invention is directed toward this inherent problem of CMOS integrated circuit latch up. A CMOS circuit has a resistance to the latch up phenomena which is a direct function of the holding current. The holding current, Ih, is the minimum current required to maintain a switching device in a closed or conducting state after it is energized or triggered. In current CMOS devices fabricated on wafers not having an epitaxial layer, Ih is approximately 2 3 ma. One prior art method of dealing with the latch up problem is the use of groove isolation as taught by Haskell in U.S. Patent No. 4,495,025, assigned to the present applicant. This is a technique which incorporates isolation trenches to minimize p n junction leakage currents and positive feedback latchup conditions. See also, UL Patent No. 4,486,266 to T. Yamaguchi. Another method of altering CMOS structures to reduce latch up events is to use an insulating layer of sapphire to insulate and separate all components such that the well junction isolation is not needed. See U.S.Patent No. 4,484,209. Uses. Patent No. 4,416,050 to Temecula similarly teaches a dielectric isolation method using oxide layers between silicon islands in which the devices are built. Another popular approach has been the use of conductive guard rings around the individual devices to affect the circuit parameters and reduce the gain factor of the parasitic SCRs. Each of these techniques bears the same penalties of using valuable die space which could otherwise be dedicated to additional circuit components or requiring extraordinarily complicated process steps. We will describe a CMOS structure having an exceedingly improved resistance to the latch up phenomena. We will also describe latch up resistantCMOS integrated circuit devices having reduced device geometries and increased performance. We will also describe a simple method of manufacturing a latch up resistant CMOS integrated circuit device. We will also describe a method for fabricating latch up resistant CMOS integrated circuits having reduced device geometries and increased performance. In one aspect, the present invention provides a latch up resistantCMOS integrated circuit device, having a substrate and at least one p channel transistor and at least one n channel transistor configuration, in which latchup resistance is a function of the holding current, Ih, wherein the drain regions of said transistors lie in an adjacently spaced parallel configuration in said substrate, the source regions of said transistors lie in a spaced parallel configuration outlaying said drain regions, and the gates of said transistors are in a space parallel configuration superposing said substrate. To optimize the resistance to Satch up, the output of the circuit is drawn from the drain regions between the gates. Another aspect of the invention is the provision of a method for producing a latch up resistant complementary metal oxide semiconductor CMOS circuit in a substrate of a first conductivity type, by forming a region of a second conductivity type embedded in said substrate forming a first gate over said substrate and a second gate over said embedded region, such that said gates have their respective longitudinal axes lying in first parallel planes forming a first source region in said substrate on the side of said first gate which is furthest from said embedded region and forming a first drain region in said substrate on the side of said first gate electrode nearest said embedded region, such that said first source region and said first drain region have their respective longitudinal axis lying in second parallel planes which straddle the plane of said first gate forming a second drain region in said embedded region on the side of said second gate which is nearest said first drain region and forming a second source region in said embedded region on the side of said second gate electrode distal from said first source region, such that said second drain region and said second source region have their respective longitudinal axes lying in third parallel planes which straddle the plane of said second gate, whereby said first, second and third parallel planes are mutually parallel. Other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description and the accompanying drawings, in which like reference designations represent like features throughout the figures.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIGURE 1 is a plan view top of a typical layout schematic for a conventional, prior art CMOS inverter integrated circuit structure FIGURE 2a is a plan view top of the layout schematic according to the present invention of an n well CMOS inverter integrated circuit structure FIGURE 2b is a plan view top of the layout schematic according to the present invention as shown in FIGURE 2A in a preferred orientation of substrate and well pick ups FIGURE 3 is a electrical schematic diagram of the circuit as shown inFIGURES 1 and 2 FIGURE 4a is a plan view top of an alternative embodiment according to the present invention as shown in FIGURE 2 FIGURE 4b is a plan view top of the layout schematic according to the present invention as shown in FIGURE 4a in an alternative orientation of the substrate and well pick ups FIGURE 5 is a plan view top of another alternative embodiment according to the present invention as shown in FIGURE 2 FIGURE 6 is a plan view top of another alternative embodiment according to the present invention as shown in FIGURE 2 FIGURE 7 is a plan view top of the layout schematic according to the present invention of a p well CMOS inverter integrated circuit structure FIGURES 8 13 are cross sectional drawings showing a process sequence for the method of manufacture according to the present invention for the embodiment as shown in FIGURE 2, section A A FIGURE 14 is a graphical representation of empirical data, showing a plot of holding current vs. various alternative structural layouts for the device of FIGURE 2 FIGURE 15 is a graphical representation of empirical data, showing a plot of holding current vs. various alternative structural layouts for the device of FIGURE 2 as embodied on an epitaxial wafer FIGURE 16 shows a plan view top of the prior art device as shown inFIGURE 1 and a plot of holding current vs. various output electrode combinations designated in the view and FIGURE 17 shows a plan view top of the structure of the present invention as shown in FIGURE 2 and a plot of holding current vs. various output electrode combinations designated in the view.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION Reference is now made in detail to a specific embodiment of the present invention, which illustrates the best mode presently contemplated by the inventors for practicing the invention. Alternative embodiments are also briefly described and set forth in the accompanying drawings. The drawings referred to in this description are understood not to be drawn to scale. It is especially important to note that only one circuit devi ce, an inverter, has been used to exemplify the invention. The drawings are intended to illustrate only one portion of an integrated circuit fabricated in accordance with the present invention. Any of the conventional integrated circuit fabrication techniques, such as CVD, PECVD, ion implantation, etc., may be employed throughout the formation steps. Oxidation, diffusion, and metallization steps to fabricateFETs are well known and understood in the art and there is no need to elaborate in order for one skilled in the art to understand the present invention. The test devices of the present invention were fabricated in conventional 1.5 micron technology using commercially available diffusion and implant machines. In order to demonstrate the best mode for practicing the invention, a comparison is demonstrated to a conventional CMOS inverter integrated circuit device 2 as shown in FIGURE 1 key layers only . The electrical equivalent schematic is shown in FIGURE 3. The inverter is the basic building block of the most complex CMOS arrays now in use. It is important to keep in mind that the teaching herein applies equally to other building blocks, such as logic gates, comparators and memory cells of digital logic integrated circuits. A p channel MOSFET 4 and n channel MOSFET 6 are known to perform the inverter function when operably coupled in the series common gate configuration as shown. In operation with a biasing voltage, Vcc, at 5 volts, the p channel MOSFET 4 is turned OFF and the n channel MOSFET 6 is turnedON for a Vin of 5 volts. This operation reverses for Vin at 0 volts. In either of these two stable conditions, since one of the MOSFETs is in a very high impedance OFF state, the combination will draw almost no steady state current. Virtually no power dissipation occurs. Referring to FIGURE 1, into the substrate 8 of a first conductivity type p in this example , a well 10 of a second conductivity type n was implanted to form a region where a device, such as a FET of the first conductivity type, was constructed. The source region 12 of the p MOSFET 4 is normally implanted to lie in the same plane as that of the source region 14 of the n MOSFET 6. Similarly, the drain region 16 of the p MOSFET 4 and the drain region 18 of the nMOSFET 6 are normally implanted to lie in another single plane which is parallel to said source plane. The gate region 20 for each transistor is then constructed in a single plane which is between said sources plane and drain plane. The input, output, and biasing pick ups are labelled accordingly. According to the present invention, in order to minimize the latch up phenomena, this configuration must be abandoned. Referring specifically toFIGURE 2a and using the same exemplary inverter device of FIGURE 3, an n well 30 is embedded in substrate 28 where the p channel MOSFET 24 is to be formed. The source region 32 of the p MOSFET 24 and the source region 34 of the n MOSFET 26 in the substrate 28 are implanted to lie in parallel planes.Similarly, the drain region 36 of the pMOSFET 24 in the well and the drain region 38 of the n MOSFET 26 in the substrate are implanted to lie in parallel planes which are mutually parallel to their respective source regions 32, 34.The source drain channel regions of each transistor are automatically oriented in parallel planes straddled by the respective source drain planes of each. The gate 40 of the pMOSFET 24 and the gate 42 of the n MOSFET 26 are formed over the respective channel regions so as to be properly aligned and in planes which are parallel to each other and to the abovffaid source planes and drain planes viz., basically in the same planes as the respective channel planes. Since for this inverter device the gates 40, 42 are coupled in common, they are shown joined into a single structure at gate pick up electrode 44. The substrate and well pick ups shown in the various configuration of FIGURES 2 and 4 7 are positioned in arbitrary locations which are not critical to the invention. The substrate and well pick up positions can be determined in accordance with the most efficient geometry of the particular device in which the present invention is to be practiced. However, it is generally preferred in accordance with the present invention to keep each such pick up in a location which is as near as possible to the complementary side of the device as shown, for example, in FIGURES 2b and 4b. In these configurations the substrate and well pick ups can be shared by adjacent devices in the die.Moreover, the drain regions 36, 38 are implanted such that their parallel planes lie adjacently spaced between the parallel planes defined by the gates 40, 42, respectively.Hence, the planes defined by the sources 32, 34 are on the outboard regions of the device 22. Note also that the output, Vout, taken at metal layer 46 is pulled from both drains 40, 42 in the inboard region of the device 22. As discussed below, this further increases latch up resistance. Both the biasing potential, Vcc and the ground reference, Vss, are separated by the gates 40, 42 and coupled outboard of the source regions 34, 32, respectively. This novel structure appears to minimize latch up due to the following mechanism. The two inside drains behave like bipolar transistor collectors in the layout taught by the present invention. The n channel device drain 34 performs the function of an npn collector. The p channel device drain 36 performs the function of a pnp collector. Hence, a lot of current is collected and depletes the effective current which otherwise would cause latch up. Another inherent advantage of this layout, as compared to the prior art, is that without physically separating the two CMOS transistors further away from each other, the p to n spacing between sources is automatically increased by two drain widths plus two gate widths. FIGURE 14 is a graphical representation of empirically measured values of holding current, Ih, for eight perturbations of the structural layout for aCMOS inverter integrated circuit. The circuit according to the present invention as shown in FIGURE 3 increases the holding current by approximately one order of magnitude over that of FIGURE 1. FIGURE 15 is a graphical representation of the same nature as that shown in FIGURE 14, only the circuits were fabricated on an epitaxially grown wafer substrate. For devices processed onto epitaxial wafers, this will increase the holding current by approximately another order of magnitude due to the increased p to n spacing between sources. Notice that the circuit fabricated in accordance with the present invention as shown in FIGURE 3 did not latch up under typical operating extremes. FIGURES 8 13 illustrate in cross section idealized, sequential processing steps of the present invention along line A A of FIGURE 2. FIGURE 8 is a view of a semiconductor structure which includes a lightly doped p conductivity type substrate 28 and an nconductivity type well 30 formed therein. On the upper surface of the substrate 28 a relatively thin insulator layer 50 on the order of approximately 150 to 500 Angstroms of silicon dioxide has been formed. A typical technique for forming the oxide 50 is by heating the underlying substrate to a temperature in the range of approximately 800 to 1100 degrees centigrade for a time sufficient to build up a desired thickness in an oxygen ambient. FIGURE 9 and 10 are cross sectional views of further stages of the fabrication and example of the details of the steps of this stage of the process are explained in U.S. Patent No. 4,481,705 HASKELL , PROCESS FORDOPING FIELD ISOLATION REGIONS IN CMOS INTEGRATED CIRCUITS, assigned to the common assignee of the present invention, and incorporated herein by reference the field implant in the well is optional . FIGURE 11 shows the structure at step completion after a thin gate oxide layer 54 on the order of 250 Angstroms has been grown according to conventional methods. A common technique can be employed to form the polysilicon gates 40, 42 of the circuit device such as by using a photoresist mask to pattern the layer of deposited polysilicon used to define the gates 40, 42 of the transistors. Referring briefly to FIGURES 1 and 2a, it can be seen that a crucial difference between the prior art and the present invention lies in the gate structure defined in this step. As set forth above, the empirical study of the present invention was conducted in 1.5 micron technology channel length defined . All dimensions of the structure will be directed accordingly with the size technology chosen. In other words, channel length and width are not a limitation to this process or structure. CMOS devices of any size can be layed out in accordance with the present invention and similar results will be obtained. Hence, no further exposition of other specific dimensions is warranted in order to practice the invention. Forming the p MOSFET gate 40 in a plane parallel to the n MOSFET gate 42 as best seen in FIGURE 2 is a step, which when coupled with the similar parallel plane geometry for the source and drain implants as shown inFIGUREs 2, 4 6, 12 and 13, results in greatly increased resistance to latchsp. FIGURE 12 provides the cross section of the structure at step completion after the implantation of the p MOSFET 24 source 32, drain 36 and n conductivity type n well pick up and the n MOSFET 26 source 34, drain 38 and p conductivity type substrate pick up. Again as in the gate formation, the forming of these regions in mutually parallel planes with the drain regions adjacently spaced and the source regions outlaying the drains and gates results in greatly increased resistance to latch up. FIGURE 13 shows the cross section of the structure after final step completion showing insulator layers 58, metal interconnects 60 and a passivation topside layer 62 formed in accordance with conventional techniques. Note that the output, Vout, is pulled from the drains 36, 38 from between the gate planes. As shown in FIGURE 15, this structure when formed on an epitaxially grown wafer substrate, did not latch up at all under test conditions. This method appears to be universal. It can be used to fabricate manyCMOS circuit layouts to obtain the same orders of effect. Using the n well process as an example, alternative inverter circuits are shown in FIGURE 4 butting contacts , FIGURE 5 additional guard rings , and FIGURE 6 donut transistors . The same concept also can be applied to p well FIGURE 7 or other CMOS processes. The application of the present invention has also been found to apply to a donut structure CMOSFET device as is shown in FIGURE 6. Notice in this particular inverter circuit device that although the respective source regions 32, 34, the drain regions 36, 38 and the gates 40, 42 can not be described or defined by mutual parallel plane geometry, the basic structure of having at least a portion of the respective drains inboard of the respective sources is maintained. As shown throughout the embodiments in FIGURE 2, 4 6 and as further demonstrated in FIGURES 14 through 17, the resistance to latch up is maximized when the circuit biasing potential, Vcc, and the circuit ground reference, Vss are supplied to the respective source regions 32 and 34 from metallization which outlies the structure, i.e. the electrodes are separated by the respective gate and drain regions of the structure. Moreover, the output of the device, Vout, when pulled from the drain regions 36, 38 at the center of the structure provides the device having the highest resistance to latch upFIGURES 16 and 17 show the empirical data obtained for a conventional layout and the present invention, respectively. Each case represents the pulling ofVout from the alphabetically labelled drain region alternatives. The present invention is particularly suited to high voltage circuits such as EPROMs or EEPROMs which are particularly prone to latch up. The foregoing description of the preferred embodiment of the present invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed, and obviously many modifications and variations such as to the sequence of the process steps are possible in light of the above teaching. The embodiment was chosen and described in order to explain the principles of the invention and its practical application to thereby enable others skilled in the art to best utilize the invention in various embodiments and with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated. It is intended that the scope of the invention be defined by both the claims appended hereto and their equivalents.
