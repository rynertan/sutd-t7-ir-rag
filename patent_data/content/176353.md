## Description
Nuclear magnetic resonant NMR is a test procedure which does not involve invasion of the human body. It can be implemented risk free without side effects or cumulative exposure problems. The signals obtained from it can be recorded and subsequently analyzed. With these advantages in mind, the present apparatus and method set forth a safe breast cancer detection system. This apparatus is particularly capable of detecting tumorous masses in the human breast, both malignant and benign. A particular advantage of the present apparatus is the fact that it can make relatively quick measurements without bodily invasion, thereby yielding tumor information. It has been discovered that a significant portion of the tissue in the region of the breast both normal tissue and tumorous tissue is made up of water. There are differing binding levels for the hydrogen in the water. The tissue of interest provides one response if the tissue is normal. A different response is provided by cancerous tissue. In DE A 3140225 there is disclosed an apparatus for testing the human breast, comprising It has now been discovered that easier detection of the different responses for normal and cancerous tissues can be achieved by means of the comparison signals obtained from adjacent slices or segments interrogated by NMR techniques. In other words, the data from a first slice is subtracted from data obtained from the adjacent second slice to yield a first difference signal. Second and third difference signals are obtained in like fashion. The signals can then be plotted as a function of breast length to locate the position within the breast of each data point, and to isolate further anomalies in data indicative of tumors. Accordingly the apparatus of the present invention is characterised in that the apparatus includes means for serially moving a specific volume along a path to examine the entire breast with N examinations and means for obtaining N 1 difference signals from the N examinations and means for plotting the N 1 difference signals to locate and detect anomalies indicative of abnormal growths in the breast. In accordance with the present invention there is also provided a method of conducting a noninvasive test of a female breast comprising the steps of This apparatus and the method related thereto utilizes NMR interrogation for the express purpose of obtaining data derived from the hydrogen water concentration and the spin lattice or the spin spin relaxation times of hydrogen, often identified by the constants T₁ and T₂. Through this analysis, the concentration of loosely bound water in the body tissue can be determined. Equally, the concentration of more tightly bound water in the body tissue can be determined. As a means of placing the equipment in near proximity so that data can be obtained, the present invention contemplates the use of a changing magnetic field. This can be obtained by forming a fixed magnetic field of proper field intensity and moving the magnet toward the patient undergoing testing. One alternative to this is to utilize a fixed magnet and vary the magnetizing current, thereby changing the field intensity and creating a segment of the field of proper field strength. Alternate arrangements utilizing combinations of changing field current or magnet location will enhance the investigation procedure set forth herein. The changing field enables an isolated portion of the body tissue to be examined. It takes advantage of the relationship obtained from the frequency of the interrogation pulse and magnetic intensity. For a given frequency, there is a single magnetic intensity. If the field is shaped with a gradient, only a portion of the field will define the proper magnetic intensity. This intensity is identified by the symbol H With the foregoing in view, the present apparatus is summarized as a structure including an examination table having a hole or holes therein to enable a patient undergoing tests to recline on the table, placing one breast or both breasts through openings in the table. This extends the breast and assures that the breast is within the operating range of the NMR test equipment. Multiple test points are obtained. The magnetic field intensity is varied so that the field intensity segments the breast into a number of relatively thin test volumes, each having a relatively thin dimension and each comprising a relatively thin slice. The test apparatus includes a magnetic field controller. This controls the current applied to the electromagnet to thereby define the field. A transmitter forms a pulse at a selected frequency which is applied to a coil. The coil is positioned so that it surrounds the breast, enabling the breast to be inserted into the coil volume for interrogation. The equipment also includes a NMR receiver connected to the coil. The receiver is output to a circuit measuring the difference between consecutive received signals. This difference is supplied to a recorder which records the different signals as a function of breast length. Breast length is defined as the dimension of the magnetic field area wherein the breast is placed. Inasmuch as multiple data points are obtained, the output of the apparatus is a signal which is a function of length. Anomalies in the difference signal are indicative of a tumor or other mass causing distortion in the data arising from differences in tightly bound and loosely bound water within the body tissue. So that the manner in which the above recited features, advantages and objects of the present invention are attained and can be understood in detail, more particular description of the invention, briefly summarized above, may be had by reference to the embodiments thereof which are illustrated in the appended drawings. It is to be noted, however, that the appended drawings illustrate only typical embodiments of this invention and are therefore not to be considered limiting of its scope, for the invention may admit to other equally effective embodiments. Attention is first directed to Fig. 1 of the drawings. There, a table which comprises a portion of the test apparatus is shown. The test apparatus 10 includes an examination table 11. A circular hole 12 of appropriate diameter is formed in the table, and the table is typically covered with resilient padding and cloth for the comfort of the patient. The patient reclines on the table in the manner shown in Fig. 1 positioning one breast in the opening 12 so that it will hang in pendulant fashion into the opening and extend through the opening for examination. The length of the breast is herein defined as a measure along the center line of the opening 12. This refers to the length or extent of the breast as it hangs by gravity into the opening, thereby being exposed for examination by the NMR test technique. This test technique utilizes multiple interrogations of the breast extending through the opening. In addition, the sensitive volume as will be defined hereinafter extends upwardly toward the thorax cavity, thereby assuring that a significant portion of the breast is examined, also including within this examination that area of the breast which is located immediately adjacent to the rib cage and sternum. The test equipment further includes a detection coil and magnet as will be described. One embodiment of the procedure contemplates testing of first one breast and then the other through the use of the same equipment. Another embodiment uses one magnet with two detection coils, one for each breast. For the first embodiment, the opening 12 is located more or less toward the center of the table so that the patient undergoing testing can conveniently lay adjacent to the table opening for testing of both breasts. Such testing can be conveniently undertaken with only partial disrobing and convenient covering with a spread or sheet 13 for benefit of the patient without interferring with the performance of the test. If desired, for personal comfort the breast could also be covered by a thin gauze bra without seriously influencing the desired results. Before describing the remainder of the equipment in detail, it would be helpful to understand the interplay between the interrogation pulse frequency and magnetic field intensity. For a given frequency, there is one thin range of magnetic field intensities appropriate to obtain resonance of the hydrogen nuclei. In other words, frequency is proportional to field intensity. The magnet is therefore preferably operated to define a sensitive volume within a region defined by intensity H This specific intensity defines the sensitive volume 16. The sensitive volume is thus limited more or less to a circle of width ΔH As observed in Fig. 2, the sensitive volume 16 is moved so that all portions of the breast are scanned. Movement can be obtained either by moving the magnet up and down, or alternatively changing the magnetizing current to change the location of the requisite field intensity symbolized at H Attention is next directed to Fig. 3 of the drawings. There, a schematic block diagram is set forth the purpose of detailing the construction of the device. In Fig. 3, the numeral 15 identifies the magnet. It should be kept in mind that Fig. 3 is a symbolic representation of the magnet. The magnet field forms both internal and external volumes. The internal volume is just below the opening 12 in the examination table 11. The breast extends into the area between the pole pieces of the magnet. The breast further extends centrally along the axis of the detector coil 18. The field intensity is determined by magnetic field controller 19. This is connected to the coils defining the magnet 15 and furnishes a current to vary the field intensity. The concentric detector coil 18 is connected with a detection coil circuit 20. It is connected to a transmitter circuit 21. It forms interrogation pulses in timed sequence under control of a timing circuit 22. The circuit 22 causes the transmitter 21 to form interrogation pulses which are supplied through the detector coil circuit 20 and are applied to the detection coil 18. Such pulses are input for the coil to transmit the necessary field. The detection coil circuit 20 switches the coil 18 after transmission for receiving data the data is output from the circuit 20 to a receiver 24, and the signal amplitude is output by the receiver 24. The received signal output is supplied as a function of time to a difference signal circuit 25. This circuit stores a first received signal, obtains a second and sequential received signal, measures the difference between the two and forms a difference signal output to a recorder 26. The recorder 26 records the data. The recorder 26 stores in suitable format a plot of difference signals as a function of breast length, thereby focusing on signal anomalies indicative of a cell or growth within the breast. Attention is directed to Fig. 4 of the drawings. There, the numeral 30 identifies the structure shown in Fig. 4 to be a scanning apparatus to assure that different areas of the breast are scanned for NMR response. To this end, the apparatus shown in Fig. 4 is especially made to move the magnet toward the patient undergoing observation to bring the magnet steadily along the length of the breast to vary the location of the sensitive volume, assuring testing of the entire breast. The structure of Fig. 4 shows the top of the table at 31. Beneath the table, facing angle frame members 32 and 33 function as guides for the magnet. They are spaced so that they guide the magnet 15 in upward and downward movement. Preferably, the magnet 15 is captured between upstanding vertical members so that it is guided without wobble or canting. It travels to the uppermost position which is immediately below the table top 31, and it retracts downwardly by a distance sufficient to scan the full length of the breast. As a suggestion, to encompass a wide range of breast lengths, a travel or stroke of 150 millimeters will typically suffice. Moreover, the magnet 15 is typically guided by or among four angle members arranged at the four corners at the magnet. In this construction, it is presumed that the magnet is rectangular in cross section having four corners, and is located within the guides which enable the magnet to travel vertically. The magnet is preferably moved by any suitable motive means, and one convenient apparatus is a double acting piston and cylinder construction as identified at 35. The magnet is supported on a piston rod 36 which extends to the magnet and connects with the magnet. Preferably, the piston rod is joined to the center of magnet so that an even force is applied to the magnet thereby preventing wobbling. It will be further noted that Fig. 4 includes the detection coil 18 on the interior of the magnet, that is between the pole pieces. In the preferred construction, a liner of thin rubber or plastic can be positioned on the interior of the detection coil to enclose and house the detection coil. Such a liner will not impede the operation of the device, and may provide greater comfort to the patient, and also reduce the risk of pinching. The risk of pinching can also be reduced or eliminated by constructing the coil so that it is somewhat larger than the opening 12 formed in the examination table. Whatever the case, an internal liner can be conveniently positioned inside the coil. Fig. 4 shows also a Faraday type shield 37. This shield 37 is inserted between the RF coil 18 and the pendulous breast to shield the breast from unwanted and unneeded electric fields from the coil 18. The electric fields are not needed for the magnetic resonance phenomenon. The shield 37 therefore should be such that it passes the radio frequency magnetic fields needed for the nuclear magnetic resonance but does not pass the electric fields. Fig. 4 shows several lines of flux, all for the purpose of defining the desired magnetic field intensity H From the foregoing, it will be therefore be seen that the sensitive volume 16 sweeps out a volume which encompasses the region of the breast. In fact, when the patient is in a reclining position, and noting that the sensitive volume 16 is above the top end of the pole pieces, testing can occur fully to the rib cage of the patient. Considering now Figs. 5 and 6 jointly, the maximum possible range of travel for the equipment is divided into N test areas or segments. This represents the location of the sensitive volume 16 along a center line axis within the detection coil. This moving volume must sweep through the entirety of a breast, the representative breast in pendulent position being shown in Fig. 5. The length of travel is the ordinate of Fig. 5 and has been divided into N segments. All the segments are slightly curved segments because the volume 16 is slightly arcuate. The curvature does not detract from the integration described. The first segment is defined at the maximum point of breast penetration into the test area. This is where N equals zero. The test sequence contemplates N equal to a specific integer to obtain a total of N data points as shown in Fig. 5. In Fig. 6, there is a plot of difference signal versus breast length. If the breast does not extend to the full length where N equals zero, no data is obtained. There is some disturbance to the shape of the curve as shown in Fig. 6 when the breast is first encountered and data is then displayed. The difference signal is exaggerated as a result of the change from no data to some output data. The difference signal is thus plotted as a function of length. The difference signal should normally show a nominal flat value except in the occurance of signal anomalies indicative of a growth. Assume that the difference signal is an arbitrary ten units from data point to data point arising from observation of a healthy breast. A disturbance in the difference signal will be indicative of a growth or tumor. This is observed because such a tumor or growth materially alters the state of water in the area of the breast. In fact, the water concentration is changed markedly so that even relatively small growths can be detected. The threshold value depends on the sensitivity of the system and will vary depending on the dimensions of the coil, the sensitivity of the receiver, the thickness of the sensitive volume, and other scale factors. The difference signal is thus recorded as a function of length so that it can be evaluated to determine whether or not further examination is required. The type of NMR signal interrogation can be selected. One type of NMR interrogation is to observe the free induction decay FID signal following a single 90 pulse. The FID signal is found in the output of each data point adjacent data points are again subtracted from one another to provide the difference signal as described hereinabove. An alternate form of interrogation is to observe the echo following a dual pulse sequence from the transmitter. This enables the characteristic relaxation time T₂ to be obtained. The echo amplitude thus follows a dual pulse sequence wherein the pulse pattern is 90 τ 180 . This pattern yields relaxation time T₂. An alternate approach is to observe the FID amplitude following two pulses at 90 spacing while altering the spacing to enable recordation of the amplitude and thereby yielding characteristic time T₁. Other interrogation techniques can be used. The pulse pattern typically contemplates one or two transmitter pulses at each data point. That is, for each of the levels of the sensitive volume 16 ranging from level zero to level N the data is recorded as a function of the difference between adjacent test signals. That is, up to N test points are made. The difference signal is obtained between adjacent signal outputs. The difference signal is more readily examined and easily interpreted. There is some degree of variation as a result of the factor. The factor refers to the fact that the breast is, speaking somewhat loosely, conic in shape and hence, adjacent interrogated sections of the breast are different in size or fill within the sensitive volume. However, if the number of data points referring to the maximum value of N is increased, the adjacent sections become thinner and hence more nearly uniform. That is, the rate of change between adjacent volumes is markedly reduced. This enables the fill factor change to be reduced significantly. Many variations can be made in the present apparatus and method of testing. As an example, one variation is to move the sensitive volume by changing the current applied to the magnet 15. An alternate approach is to move the magnet and hence move the sensitive volume certain portions of the breast will be exposed to magnetic field intensity which is not the required H As a suggested rate of obtaining data, one data point can be obtained at a rate of one per second with 300 data points required to span the full maximum length of fifteen centimeters, assuming that there is approximately 50 overlap. In other words, 300 data points will more than amply cover a region of 150 millimeters length in segments which are about one millimeter thick. Going now to the pulse repetition rate, if one data point is taken every second, this permits sufficient time for the hydrogen nuclei to be realigned after the last disturbance. The interrogation pulse typically has a pulse width between 10 and 50 microseconds. The frequency of the interrogation pulse is typically less than about 8 megahertz but there is no limitation to it being higher. While the foregoing is directed to the preferred embodiment, the scope thereof is determined by the claims which follow.
