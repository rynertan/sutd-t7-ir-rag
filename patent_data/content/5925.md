A workstation 10 includes a working area 12 inside an enclosure 11 to which an operative can gain access via an access aperture 13 beneath a transparent window, an air circulation system, including a fan 16 , being provided for drawing air from the enclosure 11 and directing it back to the enclosure 11 via a filter 15 , an outlet being provided downstream of the filter for diverting a proportion of the clean air from the filter 15 , so as to cause a lowering of pressure inside the enclosure 11 sufficient to cause an inflow of ambient air via the access aperture 13 .
