# STRAIN GAUGE BRIDGE ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
Strain gauges R1, R2, R3, R4 are arranged in a bridge formation to eliminate errors. To reduce these further, particularly those arising from temperature variation, each branch of the bridge may be composed of a series of small gauges R, R, R, R and these are all spatially intermixed over the area of the transducer. Alternatively, the gauges 6, 8 are stacked on each other, with insultating film 7 between, to reduce the overall area, or pairs 9, 10 may be interdigitated and the pairs stacked with insulating film 11 between.
