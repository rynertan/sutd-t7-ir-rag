# Logic analyzer.

## Abstract
Logic data input data is sequentially supplied to a data memory 13 using sampling pulses and the input data is writ ten into the data memory at an address specified by an ad dress signal from an address counter 15 which advances by one upon each occurrence of the sampling pulse. The input data and an output trigger word from a trigger word register 34 are compared by a trigger word detector 27 , and when coincidence is detected therebetween, a coincidence signal generated, which signal is delayed by a delay means 26 by a value corresponding to output delay data from a delay register. The delayed output is provided as a stop signal. By the stop signal the address counter is preset to a leading address of a storage area of the data memory into which data is to be stored and the next trigger word is provided from the trigger register. Further, the next delay data is provided from a delay register and the next store number is output from a store num ber register 28 . The sampling pulses are counted by a store number counter 25 , and when the count value coincides with the output store number from the store number register be fore the stop signal is generated, the address counter is preset to the leading address of the storage area of the data memory into which data is being written at that time.
