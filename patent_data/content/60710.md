# Liquid detergent compositions containing alpha amine oxide surfactants.

## Abstract
Liquid detergent compositions containing alpha amine oxide surfactants and having a pH of from about 9.0 to about 13.0 are disclosed. The alpha amine oxides have improved stability against metal catalyzed decomposition in the present compositions. The compositions preferably contain heavy metal chelating agents, and also other sur factants and detergent adjunct materials.
