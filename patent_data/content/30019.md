# GRAFT COPOLYMER, A COATING COMPOSITION COMPRISING SAME AND THE PROCESS FOR ELECTROCOATING SUCH COMPOSITIONS

## Abstract
A polyamine epoxy ether graft copolymer having an acrylic polamine backbone with secondary amine and hyd roxy functionality, part of which is terminal primary hydroxy groups, onto which is grafted an epoxy ether. The ether is an epoxy resin preferably reacted with nonylphenol resulting in a monoepoxide ether with one or less epoxy group per epoxy ether molecule. The ether is reacted with part of the secondary amine on the acrylic backbone. This system can be formulated to a nearly neutral pH cathodic dispersion with good cure response at 150 175 C using conventional aminoplast crosslinkers.
