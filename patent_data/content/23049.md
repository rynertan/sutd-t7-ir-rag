# Process for passivating metals, modified cracking catalyst and cracking process.

## Abstract
Metals such as nickel, vanadium and iron contaminating a cracking catalyst are passivated by contacting the cracking catalyst under elevated temperature conditions with tungsten or compounds of tungsten. A modified cracking catalyst containing desactivating amounts of nickel, iron and vanadium and a passivating amount of tungsten. Cracking process during which a passivating amount of tungsten is added in the cracking zone.
