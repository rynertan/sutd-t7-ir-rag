# MAXIMUM FREQUENCY LIMITER

## Abstract
The circuit limits the frequency of pulses passing through it from input 62 to output 66 by deleting any input pulse which follows too closely on the preceding pulse. A counter 116 counts clock pulses from 110, and stops at count 15. An input pulse sets flip flop 118, which resets flip flop 114, which allows counter 116 to cycle back to 0 and produce an output pulse. The output pulse resets flip flop 118, which flip flop 114, so the counter 116 stops again at count 15 awaiting the next input pulse. The output pulses cannot occur at intervals less than 16 times the period of the clock pulses.
