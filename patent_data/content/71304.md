# Device for the optical scanning of a document.

## Abstract
The device comprises a transducer 3 comprising a row of photoelectric elements 27 , and a coupling member 7 with an entrance 11 which is to be directed towards the document 1 and an exit 13 which is coupled to the transducer. The coupling member is constructed as an integrated optical waveguide circuit comprising a glass substrate 17 in which there are provided grooves 19 which, in order to form optical conductors 21 , are filled with a glass having a refractive index which is higher than that of the glass of the substrate. The width of each groove gradually decreases from the entrance of the coupling member towards the exit and over the entire length of the grooves the distance between every two adjacent grooves is substantially constant and substantially smaller than the width of the grooves, so that substantially all light originat ing from a scanned line of the document is supplied to the transducer.
