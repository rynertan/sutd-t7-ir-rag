# Inductive radio control system for vehicles.

## Abstract
In an inductive radio control system for a vehicle, data transmission between, a vehicle 2 which travels along a travel path 1 provided for a predetermined route and a ground operation control unit 5 , is performed by inductive radio means in such a manner that one of the loop antennas 8 l to 8 n discretely arranged along the predetermined route is coupled to a corresponding transmitter receiver provided in a ground unit 10 in accordance with the travelling position of the vehicle. The number of transmit ters receivers is the same as the maximum number of operating vehicles 2 .
