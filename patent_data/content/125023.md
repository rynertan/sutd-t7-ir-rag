# Recombinant immunoglobulin preparations, methods for their preparation, DNA sequences, expression vectors and recombinant host cells therefor.

## Abstract
Recombinant DNA techniques are used to produce both immunoglobulins which are analogous to those normally found in vertebrate systems and to take advantage of these gene modification techniques to construct chimeric or other modified forms.
