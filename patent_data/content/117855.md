# Process for recovering lead from lead chloride containing raw material.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method for recovering lead from lead chloride raw materials, by reducing the lead chloride with gas in a reaction zone comprising one or more separate reaction chambers. The invention is characterised in that two reduction processes are carried out simul taneously in the reaction zone, namely a reduction of solid or liquid lead chloride and a reduction of gaseous lead chloride. Non reacted lead chloride reactants in either of the two re duction processes are caused to take part as a reactant in the other process. The reduction gas is taken from the upper part 2 of the reaction zone 1 and the temperature of the upper part 2 of the reaction zone 1 is lower than the lower part 4 of the reaction zone.
