# Fishing reel.

## Abstract
A spin casting style fishing reel that has a main crank shaft 311 that is mounted in two bearings 160, 161 located at the ends of the shaft. The bearings are mounted from outside the reel body thus permitting the crank shaft 311 to be assembled at the back of the reel. The back cover plate 95 acts to lock the bearings into place in the reel.
