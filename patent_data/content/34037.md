# Material for adsorbing iodine and method for preparation thereof.

## Abstract
An adsorbing material comprises a porous body having larger pores of a mean pore diameter of 200 to 2000 Å and smaller pores of a mean pore diameter of 40 to 200 Å on the surface of the larger pores. The porous body being impregnat ed with a metal such as silver or copper, or a salt thereof such as silver nitrate. This material has excellent adsorbing perform ance for iodine and or organic iodine compounds under any degree of humidity. It may be made by making particles having the smaller pores and the bonding of these particles together, e.g. by sintering.
