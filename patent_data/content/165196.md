# Turbine blade with disk rim shield.

## Abstract
In a gas turbine engine blade has protective flanges 24 closely overlying the rim 16 of the rotor 10 to shield the rotor from the hot power gases and to form a path for cooling air. These flanges 24 are spaced radially inward from the flanges 20 on the blade that define the inner wall of the gas path through the turbine.
