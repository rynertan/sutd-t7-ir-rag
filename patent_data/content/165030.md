# Pre press proofing system incorporating antihalation layer.

## Abstract
Presensitised sheets for colour proofing comprising a removable carrier sheet bearing a photosensitive medium sensitive to radiation within the wavelength band 325 to 700 nm and comprising photohardenable, photoadherent, photoinsolubilisable or photosolubilisable material, the sheet including a removable antihalation layer which is removed either when stripping the carrier sheet or during subsequent processing. The antihalation dyes may be posi tioned within a transparent carrier sheet, in a layer on the carrier sheet opposite to the photosensitive medium or in a layer positioned between the carrier sheet and light sensitive medium.
