# Hydraulic device particularly for ski boot fastening.

## Abstract
The hydraulic device comprises a pumping element 1 which, through a selector assembly 11 , is communicated to one or all the driving members 20 provided on a boot and wherewith there is connected a hook element 24 for effecting the fastening of the boot, the selector assembly 11 being adapted to allow the releasing of one or all the fastening elements by communicating them to a reservoir 10 of a selected working fluid. Thus, the ski boot may be fastened without the applica tion of any excessive effort, while retaining at all times the possibility of accurately adjusting the applied force.
