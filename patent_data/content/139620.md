# Method and apparatus for forming elastic elements under tension from a continuous elastic web, particularly for manufacturing sanitary products such as disposable diapers and the like.

## Abstract
A supply source 14 of continuous elastic web 13 and a support 11 for the fixing of elastic elements 4 are provided. On the support, which is normally constituted by a rotary drum, there are located at least one clamping element 12 fixed to the support 11 itself and a further clamping element 15 which is movable relative to the fixed element between first and second positions A,B . The distance between the fixed element 12 and the movable element 15 in the second position B is less than the distance between the two elements in the first position A and is substantially equal to the length of the tensioned elastic elements 4 which it is desired to form. The free end of the continuous elastic web 13 is clamped in the movable clamping element 15 when this element is in its first position A . There is thus produced, simultaneously and substantially continuously a relative movement between the supply source 14 and the support 11 in the direction of alignment of the clamping elements 12,15 so as to cause the supply of the continuous web 13 to the fixed clamping element 12 the translational movement of the movable clamping element 15 from its first position A to its second position B at a velocity V₂ less than the velocity V₁ of the relative movement between the web supply source 14 and the support 11 , and the supply of the web 13 from the source at a velocity V₃ less than the difference V₁ V₂ between the velocity V₁ of the relative movement between the source 14 and the support 11 and the velocity V₂ of the translation of the movable clamping element 15 between the first and second positions A,B . When the movable clamping element 15 reaches the second position B , the web 13 is clamped by the fixed clamping element 12 whereby a piece 4 of web extends between the fixed clamping element 12 and the movable clamping element 15 in a state of longitudinal tension the degree of which is determined by the velocity difference V₁ V₂ and the supply velocity V₃ of the web 13 . Finally, the web 13 is cut in the region between the fixed clamping element 12 and the supply source 14 , so as to separate the piece 4 from the body of the web 13 and define one of the tensioned elastic elements, and to form a new free end of the web 13 itself.
