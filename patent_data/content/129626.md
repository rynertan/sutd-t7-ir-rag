# Apparatus method for supporting cupboards and the like.

## Abstract
Apparatus for building, erecting or suspending structures includes an elongate linear support member which has a vertical web and a horizontal web. The vertical web has a horizontally extending flange. The elongate support member is constructed to co operate with a panel intended to hang substantially vertical from the support member with its plane substantially perpendicular to the length of the support member. An engaging means is provided between the upper edge of the panel and the support member and arranged to preclude horizontal separation of the panel and the support member once they are assembled together as hereinafter stated. Moreover, the panel has a notch in its inner edge, the notch being positioned and dimensioned to receive the said flange when the panel is presented to and hung from the support member. Such an apparatus is easy to use, versatile and offers a saving in material and therefore reduced cost.
