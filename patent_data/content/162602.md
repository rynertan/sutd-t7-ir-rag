# Reinforced pistons.

## Abstract
A reinforced piston is provided for an internal combus tion engine. The uppermost piston ring groove 14 is as close as possible to the crown 11 of the piston. At least the lower surface 17 of the groove 14 is defined by an encast insert 20 and overlying this is a portion 18 of the crown rein forced by fibres, thus allowing this portion to be thin and the spacing between the ring groove 14 and the upper surface 11 of the crown to be minimised. The reinforced crown portion also holds the insert against axial separating move ment. The crown can be provided with a combustion bowl 12 whose entrance 28 is reinforced by the fibres.
