# REDUCTION OF REACTIVITY IN COKE

## Abstract
Carbon dioxide and air reactivity reactions which occur during carbon electrode use, are reduced by treating the coke used to make the electrode after calcination with water containing a monomeric, dimeric or polymeric phosphoric acid, or a salt thereof. A representative acid is orthophos phoric acid.
