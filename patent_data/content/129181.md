# DC DC CONVERTER

## Abstract
A DC DC converter comprises an inductance 102 for connection at one terminal to a source of DC voltage V The converter requires no timebase oscillator. The converter may further comprise error feedback means 118 having an input connected to the first electrode of the capacitance, and an output connected to the second input of the comparator, the feedback means producing at its out put a feedback signal in dependence on an error in the voltage at the first electrode of the capacitance exceeding a predeter mined level.
