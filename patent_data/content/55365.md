# TOPOLOGY GENERATION PROCESS FOR AUTOMATED CIRCUIT DESIGN

## Abstract
A process automatically generating topology data for fabricating large scale integrated circuits. Technology data 110 , a logic function description and logic circuit compo nents 120 are generated and input to a data processing system together with geometric dimension data descriptive of the basic elements of the logic circuit components 170 . The geometric dimension data is assembled into a plurality of intermediate level geometric topology patterns under control of the logic function description and the intermediate level geometric topology patterns are assembled into a prime level geometric topology representative of the logic function description 200 . The logic circuit components are merged with the prime level geometric topology 500 to produce a grid array to be fabricated into a large scale integrated circuit.
