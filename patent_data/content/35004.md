## Description
Miniaturized typewriterThis invention concerns a miniaturized typewriter.There are currently available table top typewriters equipped with memory for several lines of typing for viewing on a display or video so that the accuracy of the typing can be checked before it is printed. However these machines are obviously not pocket size, due also to the necessity of connecting them to an electrical outlet so the electronic system for paper printing may function.Machines of the same size as electronic pocket calculators are also known. In addition to performing the mathematic functions planned, these are programmed to memorize.certain data corresponding to a few addresses, names or the like so that they may be viewed as desired on the display. However, these may not be considered typewriters since they have no traditional keyboard which would allow them to be used by anyone with a knowledge of typing.In fact, these machines have the same rectangular structure as most calculators, with the longer side vertical and with the alphabetic characters arranged in simple succession. This arrangement leads to great difficulty and lengthy composition times even for the few simple words which may be typed. On its part, the display is placed on the smaller edge of the rectangle and shows only a few words at a time. Other display equipped devices are programmed to translate a few selected phrases from one language fo another, but these have neither the traditional keyboard, the possibility of memorizing text nor the capability of printing on paper.The aim of this invention is to develop a real pocket typewriter which can either be held in one hand and used with the other like a traditional machine or be placed on a flat surface and used with both hands. It will allow each text typed to be viewed on a line of display with subsequent memorization line by line of information corresponding to several pages. This information may be stored even over long periods and redisplayed when needed, or may be transferred to a paper printing device incorporated in the machine or connected to the electronic memory as required.According to this invention, this aim is achieved with a rectangular structure with the longer edge horizontal equipped with miniaturized keys arranged as the traditional keyboard in addition to multiPle function control keys. This arrangement is beneath one or two lines of display perhaps of the liquid crystal type with a planned length of approximately 32 characters. Said structure contains a microcomputer programmed to effect the typing performed with said keys this typing is displayed in succession for visual verification and then is accumulated line by line in the memory. This text is stored there even when the machine is not in use to be redisplayed on the same display using the read key. There are two variants one of automatic, timed line succession and another of manually controlled display and disappearance of each line.This aim is achieved with a portable electronic typewriter composed basically of an alphanumeric display, an alphanumeric keyboard and a RAM access memory capable of storing a text typed on the keyboard and viewed on the display. This memory can store its contents for any number of days, even when the machine is not in use.Certain keys also have control functions related to theEDIT of the typed text or to the check of peripheral functions, described below. Batteries serve to operate the machine and store memory. The dimensions of the machine and the batteries allow the finding to be used as a portable typewriter.The batteries may be recharged by a line adaptor. This is also equipped with a port for exposing EPROM type memory cartridges to UV light. When inserted in the typewriter, these cartridges allow the memory of the device to be expanded so that when one or more is used the EDITed typed text may be stored for an indefinite period.These cartridges are erased by exposure to UV light as described above. E2E2ROM type memory cartridges may also be used which can be erased electrically on the machine itself.There is also a connector for interfacing with a 24 32 column alphanumeric printer, with the parallel exchange type.In one variant, the E2ROM or EPROM memory cartridge is connected by a cable and placed in a carrying case or suitable container this allows larger amounts of memory.One possible preferred example of this device is shown in the enclosed drawings, figures 1 7.Figure 1 shows an axonometric view of the complete device.Figure 2 shows the scheme of the blocks of components.Figure 3 shows a possible scheme for the power supply.Figure 4 schematizes the block for generating the standby voltage.Figure 5 indicates a possible realization of a 4 KbyteEPROM type memory expansion module.Figure 6 shows the flow chart P1 of the control program. Figure 7 gives the flow chart of the keyboard control process P2.The following particulars are indicated in the figures A typewriterB carrying caseC machine storage spaceD cable for printer 29E cable for connecting machine A with power supply 30.The following functional blocks are detailed in figure 2 1 Microprocessor.2 EPROM, PROM or ROM containing the control program.3 RAM 256x8bit whose function is to store data, states, stack it must be 8 bit.4 RAM nKx6 bit whose function is to store the mem orized text in ASCI code. For a set limited to char acters it does not have to be 8 bit, and is therefore made up of a 1 bit CHIP integrated circuit . In this way, for example, 6 CHIPS 4K bit each gives a memory field of 4Kx6 bit. The first 32 portions of this RAssI are reserved for the software used to store data while the machine is off. This RAM uses a different power supply VST than the rest of the circuit since in it the typewritten text is memorized, as mentioned. Preferably, it is a low consumption CMOS or MOS, with battery backup mode properties. That is, data is stored under con ditions of approximately 3.5V non qualification.

shifting the entire line to the right starting from the cursor, the last character on the right is lostDELCA Delete character erases the character indica ted by the cursor and covers the space with the remaining part of the line by shifting it to the left and the final character to the right by one spaceAll of the above mentioned commands are possible in the repeat mode, that is, pressing the command repeat and then the desired command. This is then performed in a burst while the key is pressed.When the key is released, the repeat mode is reset and another command in the repeat mode is possible only by repeating the repeat prefix.HOME Reports the first line of the text on the displayBOT Bottom goes to the final line of the textREPEAT Initializes the repeat modePRINT Prints the content of the memory starting from the line displayed. During printing, only the STOP command may be given.STOP During the typing phase, it displays a particu lar character which will be interpreted either in the print phase PRINT , the temporary viewing phase TIME , the storage phase SAVE as a stop command. In the print phase execution of the PRINT command , printing will stop and the machine will return to the typing phase. In the temporary display phase execution of the TIME command , it will return to the typing phase.CLRM Clear Memory erases the entire memory. As pro tection against accidental pressure, before per forming the erasure, the machine asks the ques tion Clear Memory Y N . If Y Yes is pressed, the memory is erased if N No is pressed, it is not. MCLER Master Clear is a particular command to remove the calculator from an error situation which may be used following an internal error caused, for ex ample, by discharged batteries, improper inser tion of the power supply, improper insertion of the printer.FREE Indicates the number of free lines.ADVP Advance paper, advances the paper in the printer.TIME Effects a timed display of the text star ting from the line on the display until the end of the typed text oruntilaparticular character described above appears.SAVE followed by a six letter name Stores the typing contained in the RA commat 5 in in the cartridges by memorizing in a suitable table the name of the file and its initial and final address. This phase may be stopped by the following events the end of the text to be memorized due to the end of the RAM memory the end of the text to be memorized the end of the cartridge in this case the mach ine displays a message to insert a new cartridge.LOAD followed by a six letter name Reads the typewritten text from a file contained in the cartridge and memorizes it in the RAM.DETER Asks the machine whether the typewritten text will fit in the present cartridge. The machine responds OK if the text will fit MEMORY END AT if the text will not fit and dis plays the first line which would be excluded. The following possibilities are then offered Memorizing on two cartridges Leaving a part unmemorized Using a fresh cartridge Performing an EDIT of the text, eliminating the sections of less interest and replacing words with abbreviations.The device functions as described below.All commands are executed by the program contained inEPROM 2 figure 1 .Operation is illustrated by the general execution flow in figure 6 and by the operation of the system hardware dedicated to peripherals control, tracint the flow of command execution and standard hardware CPU, RAM, PROM,I O seen from the bus side, qualification logic of the resources in the bus .The general flow, which effects initialization and the principal loop of memorization of characters as well as commands execution, also shows the repeat mode which interacts deeply with the above LOOP and the print loop.The principal LOOP uses a process P2 for reading the characters from the keyboard figure 7 which controls the cursor of the display and the state of the text memory as well as the keyboard itself.Data exchange between the two processes is synchronized through a hand shaking mechanism. Process P2 is activated on a time slicing basis.As deduced from figure 6, the software must know the state and configuration of the hardware.The individual pieces of data are acquired as follows State of the memory ON OFF is taken from the highest priority bit of the P.E. 10 .Presence of a printer is determined from the TEST 1 signal TEST 1 0, printer absent TEST 1 1, printer present . The number of lines of the printer is determined from theTEST 2 signal TEST 2 0, 32 column printer TEST 2 1, 24 column printer . 2The presence and configuration of the E ROM EPROM cartridge is determined when the IDENT signal is sent to the cartridge interface, and this responds with an 8bit code figure 5 from the configuration port 40.The matrix keyboard is scanned through multiplexor 8.Any keys pressed are detected by the P.E. 10 .The scanned function is effected by process P2, Which E es care of anti rebound and supplies the code of the key read to process P1.To control the display, the software places the 6bitASCI data for the character to be displayed on I O port 7. The seventh bit is the complement of the sixth, and the two bit address inside the display block for later typing is written on one of the 8 blocks through multiplexor 14.The cursor is controlled by process P2 through the typing of a special character. The cartridge interface generates 16 address bits in output through the 16bit counter 17 . This counter may be incremented by the INC signal increment 17A or zer oed by the RESET signal 17B. In addition, said interface generates a data signal 15, controlled by port PIO2, which is bidirectional and so allows both writing and reading operations to be effected.Finally, it also generates the following auxiliary signals VPP programming voltage, software qualificiablePHODE programming qualificationCE memory qualificationCER memory erasure used only by E2ROMIDENT qualifies the configuration portThere are two parts to the power supply, one fixed section 22 andone inserted in carrying case B 30 . 30 shows the following properties A When 22 is connected and turned on, it is recharged by the constant voltage.generator 32 and batter 31 through relay 33, switched in position33A, it supplies energy to stabilizer 34.B When 22 is disconnected or turned off, section 30 supplies energy to stabilizer 34 through battery 31.C In the case of a switch from condition A to B or vice versa, the input and output capacity keeps the output voltage from varying during the switching of relay 33.D With power supply 30 either on or off, standby voltage is present. If the charge is removed switch 19 open and the standby power supply receives voltage from terminal 35A general switch 42 open , the absorption of the latter is zero. If charge is inserted with 19 closed, output voltage is approximately 3.5volts RAM 4 maintenance voltage . If voltage is supplied through terminal 35B switch 42 closed , output voltage is established at 5 volts RAM 4 operating voltage .E Upon general ignition, working voltages VCC and VST are achieved. After a certain time, the POMCL signal is deactivated by 35D. If active, this signal keeps the electronic circuit under reset and disables the typing in the memory. F When the general switch is opened, the POMCL signal is reactivated before the VCC and VST voltages degrade.As shown in points E and F , the POMCL signal has the function not only of starting the system but also of disabling the typing in the memory through logic 6 when the system is functioning improperly VCC 4.75 volts .This signal is WIRED ON with the MCL key.In other functional variants, the machine may be made with a traditional keyboard coupled with an incorporated printing device of a known type. Alternatively, it may have a terminal connected to the micro computer in a paper printer, to which the memorized information may be sent through a cable. In this way, either at the same time as the typing appears on the display or independently of it, actual mechanical typing may be performed.
