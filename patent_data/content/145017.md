# IMPROVEMENTS RELATING TO COUPLING DEVICES

## Abstract
A coupling device, for a freight container provided at each of its four corners with a mounting plate 40 having an aperture 42 therein. The device comprises a body 6 , comprising a flat base plate 10 and a mounting ring 12 with an aperture 14 , and an integral head 8 having a portion 20 spaced from the body 6 by a stem portion 18 . The head portion 20 has a cross sectional dimension which enables it to be inserted through the aperture 42 in the mounting plate 40 in one orientation but not in an orientation significantly displaced therefrom. Mounted on the body 6 is a locking member 28, 30 movable between a retracted position and an advanced position. In its advanced position, the locking member 30 lies alongside the stem portion 18 , being partially located within a groove 22 , and rotation of the device into a position in which the head portion 20 is in alignment with the aperture 42 , and thus may retract from the mounting plate 40 , is prevented.
