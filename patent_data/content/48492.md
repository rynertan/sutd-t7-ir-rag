# Drowsiness alarm system for a vehicle.

## Abstract
A drowsiness alarm system for a vehicle which gives an alarm to the vehicle driver when detecting a vehicle steering condition such as to indicate a state of drowsiness, thus preventing driving in an increasing state of drowsiness. The drowsiness alarm system, according to the present inven tion, comprises a a steering angle detection circuit 2 which outputs a first pulse 6a whenever the vehicle driver turns the steering wheel in either of the clockwise and anticlockwise directions in excess of a predetermined angle b a quick steering detection circuit 13 which outputs a second pulse 9a whenever the number of the first pulses reaches a predetermined number within a predetermined period of time and c an alarm unit 10 which gives an alarm to the vehicle driver in response to the second pulse 9a fed from the quick steering detection circuit 13 in a predetermined form. Furthermore, to ensure more accurate detection of the state of drowsiness, there may be provided in the drowsiness alarm system a frequency of steering detection circuit 18 which outputs a third pulse 30a when detecting an increasing frequency of steering changes, a vehicle sensor 16 for inhibiting the alarming when the vehicle speed is below a predetermined value, or a vehicle condition responsive circuit 101 for inhibiting the alarm when detecting that the vehicle travels in predetermined states such that the vehicle driver should not become drowsy, according to various vehicle driving conditions other than vehicle steering condition.
