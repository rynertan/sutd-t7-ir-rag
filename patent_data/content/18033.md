# Radiation detector devices and circuit arrangements including radiation detector devices.

## Abstract
In a pyroelectric detector circuit arrangement in which a pair of capacitive detector elements C₁ and C₂ formed of polarised pyroelectric material are electrically connect ed in series with the directions of polarisation of the ele ments being such that the normally produced signal volta ges are in opposition, means are provided for inhibiting the depoling of the elements under conditions of cooling or excessive temperature cycling. A pair of ultra low leakage diode elements D₁ and D₂ in series opposition connec tion are arranged in parallel connection with the capacitive detector elements and connections are present between the common points in the diode series and the capacitive detector element series. The diode elements are arranged with respect to the directions of polarisation of the detec tor elements so that for an increase in incident radiation on one or both detector elements the potential developed across the irradiated element or elements is in a sense such as to reverse bias the corresponding diode element connected in parallel therewith. In one embodiment the capacitive detectors C₁ and C₂ , the ultra low leakage diode elements D₁ and D₂ , and FET amplifier means are present in a common enve lope in the form of a hybrid microcircuit having only three external terminal connections.
