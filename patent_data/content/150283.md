# Action figure with arm movement derived from leg movement.

## Abstract
The action figure includes two pivotally mounted arms and one leg that can be rocked about a perpendicular axis. In one embodiment, the arms are mounted for pivotal move ment about a common horizontal axis, whereas in a second embodiment the arms are mounted for pivotal movement about inclined axes. In either event, an actuating mecha nism transmits motion from the leg that is rocked to either or both arms, doing so via either a single or double rotatable cam arrangement. The cam or cams have spiral ribs thereon by which a laterally moved follower converts its lateral movement into rotary movement for either or both arms. Where the arm axes are inclined, a cog arrangement is used which engages in a cruciformly shaped recess on the arm mounting units so that rotation of the cam about a horizontal axis is transmitted to the arms along their in clined axes.
