# Process for the production of extra long screw closures.

## Abstract
The process includes several already known phases, that is to say two or more drawing phases until the screw closure takes the required shape, a subsequent rolling phase and finally a phase for the insertion of any kind of sealing disk inside the closed top part of the closure. This process is characterized by the fact that it uses a special internal punch p , equipped with two or more blades 1 , located vertically, and most of all by the fact that it uses these blades 1 in the last drawing phase and furthermore by the fact that it uses said blades 1 on a line which goes from a known horizontal weakening line 2 to the lower edge of the closure. Thus it is possible to produce screw closures which are weakened vertically from the inside in that portion of the screw closure 4 which usually remains on the neck 6 of the bottle when the bottle is opened for the first time, so that this portion can be easily removed manually or mechanically by pushing downwards the abovesaid portion of the screw closure.

## Claims
CLAIMS OF INVENTION 1. Process for the production of extralong screw closures made from aluminium or from other metals, including two or more drawing phases, a rolling phase and a sealing disk insertion phase, characterized by the fact that it uses a special internal punch p dur gth final g phase, so that it creates by means of this punch vertical weakening lines l from the inside outwards without necessarily staging another machining phase. 2. Process as per claim 1, furthermore characterized by the fact that the internal punch p msed is equipped with two or more vertical blades 1 . 3. Process as per claims 1 and 2, furthermore characterized by the fact that the abovesaid specialpunch p is used in that part of the closure which goes from a known horizontal weakening line 2 also displayed by the closure to the lower edge of the closure itself, so that the further weakening lines 3 produced by means of this punch 4 are located in that part 4 of the closure which generally remains on the neck of the container when it is opened for the first time this part is therefore easy to remove by means of a simple downward motion. 4. Process as per claims 1, 2 and 3, furthermore characterized by the fact that it uses a punch p the blades 1 of which are designed to produce scoring on the required part of the closure wall from the inside outwards for a depth of approximately 9 lOths of the closure s thick ness. 5. Process as per one or more of the abovesaid claims, characterized by the fact that it uses a punch p equipped with two or more vertical blades 1 which can be resharpened and easily interchanged and replaced.

## Description
PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF EXTRALONG SCREW CLOSURES INALUMINIUM OR OTHER METALS, COMPRISING TWO OR MORE DRAWINGOPERATIONS, A ROLLING PHASE AND A SEALING DISK INSERTIONPHASE, USING A SPECIAL PUNCH EQUIPPED WITH BLADES DURINGTHE FINAL DRAWING PHASE SO THAT VERTICAL WEAKENING LINESFROM THE INSIDE OUTWARDS ARE OBTAINED ON THE CLOSURE Screw closures made from laminated aluminium are widely diffused.They are composed of a drawn cylindrical body, which is grooved and weakened horizontally by a fracture line made up of cuts and bridges, designed to separate the top part from the lower part when the container is opened for the first time.So that the glass container can be made available for recycling, the pilferproof ring located below the aforementioned horizontal fracture line has been equipped for some time with one or more vertical or oblique incision lines which divide the ring itself into sections designed to stay attached to the top part of the closure as the closure is unscrewed.The use of long skirted closure has recently made remarkable developments. In these closure, the pilferproof ring is designed to act as a collar to improve the decoration and dressing of the neck of the bottle.Commercial and environmental reasons, covered by official regulations, have made recycling of returnable glass a common practice, but have also given rise to problems concerning the removal of the metallic collar from the bottle.This removal is possible only with remarkable difficulty, due to the fact that very long vertical weak lines have to be made in the closure. In fact, long vertical weak lines compromise the x ularity of the production results if they are made as is customary, that is to say by means of a rolling operation.It is also known that screw closures are produced by cold working processes by means of one or more drawing operations.In the extralong screw closures as considered within the scope of this patent, the height to width ratio makes a second and sometimes a third drawing operation necessaryThe Applicant has had the idea of producing the vertical weakening lines of the collar during the last drawing operation and has thus obtained an optimum result from the point of view of production regularity as well as aesthetics and praticality.A positive economical consequence should not be disregarded, as up to now we have dealt with glass recovery, but the value that aluminium cost has taken and the ever more restrictive conditions of the economy in the most critical sections of bottling, especially in the enological section, suggest the opportunity of recovering the raw material aluminium, which is more valuable if it is free from foreign matter such as sealing disks.The process as described in this invention is of interest mainly to bottlers with a great production volume who generally are equipped with devices for removing screw closures from bottles to be recycled, and for whom it would be very useful to integrate this equipment with easy to fit accessories for the removal of the aluminium collar from the container and for the recovery of this collar at minimum expense.It is known that the shaping of the aluminium closure from aluminium sheet is obtained by means of a process which includes a first combined blanking and drawing phase, followed by one or more simple drawing phases, a rolling phase and a phase in which the sealing disk is inserted.The special equipment for this cold process is basically made up of two elements generally known as punch and die.The process object of this invention employs characteristically a special internal punch which produces the final drawing of the screw closure.The drawings herewith enclosed, supplied only as a non limi tative example, illustrate a preferred form of construction of the abovesaid punch, equipped with one or more vertical blades designed to produce one or more vertical weakening lines from the inside of the drawn closure.More precisely, in these drawings figure 1 is a side view, partly cutaway, of the special punch employed figure 2 is a perspective view, partly cutaway, of the punch specified in figure 1 figure 3 is a side view, partly cutaway, of the extralong closure produced by means of the process according to the invention figure 4 illustrates the abovesaid extralong closure applied to the container, in a side view partly cut away figure 5, finally, illustrates the closure divided as it appears after it has been removed from the container, the neck of which is therefore free from foreign objects.As one can see from figure 1, the punch used in the process according to the invention is made of body c fixed to the punch holder p with an intermediate circular blade for trimming the edge of the closure 11 and vertical weakening blades l this assembly is held together by locking screw b .Blades 1 are fixed to body c of punch p with the greatest possible precision, so that they can be sharpened and so that they are interchangeable with a same number of new blades.The length of blades 1 is such that it encompasses that part of the closure which goes from horizontal fracture line 2 to its edge, producing from the inside outwards one or more vertical weakening lines, with a depth of approximately 9 lOths of the thickness of the aluminium sheet from which the closure itself has been produced.There is furthermore another remarkably important fact, that is to say the fact that the scoring of the vertical lines from the inside leaves the outer surface unscathed, and therefore does not compromise aesthetics or decoration of the closure.The two or more vertical weakening lines 3, produced by the two or more vertical blades 1, by means of the location system of these blades on the body c of punch p are made during the final drawing operation of the closure, and therefore do not require further operations or extra machines.The finished closure as it appears in figure 3 is made of a cylindrical top part 1 which acts as sealing closure for the container, and is separated by means of a horizontal fracture line 2 from the lower cylindrical part 4, which displays from the inside outwards two or more vertical weakening lines 3. The closure is applied to the container by means of known capping machines located on bottling lines, by shaping the closure according to the thread 7 of the container and locking it by means of a groove 5 to the glass finish hand 8.The consumer will use the closure as he has been accustomed to for a long time, and will presumably return the returnable container together with closure 1 and its related lower part 4 locked onto the neck 6. Bottling lines have known machines for removing the threaded part of the closure from the container so that returnable containers with screw closures can be recycled. Part 4 of these closures is vertically weakened, and can be removed manually or mechanically with a simple downward motion.
