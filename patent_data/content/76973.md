## Description
A new dioxolanic compound and its method of preparation a new dioxola.nic amine with pharmacological activity, its method of preparation, and the Pharmaceutical compositions containing them.INTRODUCTIONThis present invention refers to a new dioxolanic amine with pharmacological activity which has been allocated the reference ITA 362, for brevity.This new compound has the following formula IEMI1.1 corresponding to the 2 2 benzofuranil 4 n butilaminomethyl2 p chlorophenyl l, 3 dioxolan. Equally objects of the invention are the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the said compoundITA 362, such as maleate, citrate, orotate, oxalate, malonate, p toluensulphate and the like.The invention also refers to the method of preparation of the aforementioned compound ITA 361. The new compound ITA 362 possesses intense vasodilatory, anti angina and anti arrhythmic activity, accompanied by a low toxicity. The use of the compound ITA 362 is another object of the invention.NOVELTY OF THE STARTING PRODUCTAs will be explained in detail further on in the description of the chemical synthesis, in order to prepare the compoundITA 362 one starts off from the dioxolanic derivative bromo methyl of formula II of which the structure is the following EMI2.1 In fact thins compound II is the 2 2l benzofuranil 4 bromo methyl 2 p chlorophenyl l, 3 dioxolan, which was obtained for the first time by the same inventors during the process of the research that led to to the preparation of the compound ITA 362.Hence the said compound, of formula U is a new product as also following logically, is its method of preparation.The invention refers also to this new product of formula II which is an intermediate compound in the preparation of the formula I compound. The other object of the invention is the method of preparation for the formula II compound. CHEMICAL SYNTHESISThe said compound ITA 362 as in formula I is synthesized chemically by means of a two stage process, these being a first stage having for its object the preparation of formula II, that is to say 2 2 benzofuranil 4 bromomethyl Z chlorophenyl 1, 3 dioxolane.b second stage having for its object the preparation of the compound ITA 362 starting off from formula II.Nevertheless, both stages, first and second, though having their individual identities, together form one unity of invention.The two said stages are described in detail further on.First stageThe preparation of the bromomethyl dioxolanic derivative of the formula II, that is the 2 2 benzofuranil 4 bromomethyl 2 p chlorophenyl 1, 3 dioxolane, takes place from starting with the Ketone of formula IIIEMI3.1 in a reaction of which the scheme is the following EMI4.1 To a solution of Ketone III in a chloro solvent such as methylene chloride, chloroform or carbon tetrachloride is added at low temperature, preferably around 0 50C a quantity of between 1 and 3 times mol. with respect to theKetone III of epibromhydrine. Then add slowly the catalyst corresponding to a Lewis acid preferably tin tetrachloride, boron trifluoride or anhydrous aluminium trichloride in a quantity of the order of one tenth part mol. with respect to the epibromhydrine, maintaining the mixture at a low temperature during the addition.Then reaction is completed at a temperature of between the ambient and that of the boiling point of the mixture during a suitable time from 2 to 24 hours .Having completed the reaction a solution of sodium or potassium hydroxide is added quickly up to basic pH, then, the organic phase is decanted, washed, dried and the solvent removed. The residue thus obtained is distilled at a reduced pressure. The structure of this new product corre sponds to the 2 2 benzofuranil 4 bromomethyl 2 p chlorophenyl 1,3 dioxolane, which has two isomers due to the rigidity produced in the molecule by the dioxolanic ring. These isomers are reflected by the nuclear magnetic resonance signal of the furanic proton.This type of isomer is described in great detail for systems similar to ours by P.Calinaud and J.Gelas Bull.Soc. Chem.Fr. 5 6, 1228 1236 and 1237 1242, 1975 and if we take as the principal substituen in the position 2 of the dioxolanic ring the benzofuranil residue, the structures IV and V as shown in the following schemes, are formed EMI5.1 The product so obtained is used for the following or second stage. Second StageThe preparation of the ITA 362 is done starting from the 2 2 benzofuranil 4 br omomethyl 2 p chlorophenyl 1,3 dioxolane of EMI6.1 The 2 2 benzofuranil 4 bromomethyl 2 p chlorophenyl 1,3 dioxolane is caused to react with n butylamine in an inert anhydrous solvent such as benzene, toluene or xylene at the boiling point temperature of the mixture during the time required to complete the reaction from 5 to 50 hours and in the presence of an acidity acceptor.As the acidity acceptor the same n butylamine may be used, using at least 2 mols of this for each mol of the bromomethyl derivative. Equally may be used as acidity acceptor a tertiary amine such as triethylamine or pyridine, or even in inorganic base such as anhydrous sodium or potassium carbonate.After the reaction is completed a solution of sodium or potassium hydroxide is added quickly, then, the organic phase is decanted, washed, dried, and the solvent removed yielding the product in the form of a reddish yellow oil which can be purified by distillation at a low pressure. Treatment with an acid, preferably a weak organic acid such as maleic, citric, orotic, fumaric, malonic, acetic, p toluensuphonic or similar acid, in a suitable organic solvent such as acetone methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, chloroform, ethyl acetate, benzene, and in general any organic solvent which would adequately dissolve the dioxolanic compound, allows t9 obtain a saline solide derivative which is more convenient for future handling and use. When the acid used has at the same time geometric .or optical isornerism as is the case with maleic and fumaric acid, on the formation of the corresponding salts one can separate by fractional crystallization the two diastereoisomers which may be present, thus obtaining by this means the resolution of the isomers.EXAMPLESPreliminary example first stage We describe below an example of the preparation of the 2 2 benzofuranil 4 bromomethyl 2 p chlorophenyl l , 3 dioxolane . To a solution of 136 g 0,.53 m of p chlorobenzoil 2 benzo furane in 2000 cc of anhydrous chloroform at 0 5 deg.C is added 109 g 0,80 m of epibromhydrene. Then is added slowly 45 minutes 9,4 cc 0,08m of tin tetrachloride dissolved in 35 cc of anhydrous chloroform.Having terminated the addition above, leave to attain the room temperature and keep stirring during 15 h lr.s, By means ofTLC eluent benzenelhexane 4 1 the progress of the reaction can be controlled.Quickly add 32 g of NaOH dissolved in 100 cc of water ensuring that the final pH is basic and stir during 30 minutes. Decant, wash the organic phase with water until the washings are neutral pH, dry the chloroformic solution with Na2SO4 and elliminate the solvent at a low pressure obtaining 224 g of a yellowish oil. molecular distillation at 145 deg. C and approximately 10 2 mm Hg, yields 143 g 69 . of a slightly yellow oil. A further distillation of the residue of the previous operation yields a further 41 g. total yield 88 .Halogens Schoninger experimental 28, 84 theoretical 29,30.

The experimental ratio of the aliphaticlaromatic integrals theoretical 0,555 is a very significant analytic measurement for testing the quality of the resulting product.EM Molecular peak at m e 392 and 394 with an isotopic ratio suiting a bromo atom and an chloro atom.The product so obtained is ready for the aforementioned second stage leading to the preparation of the 2 2 benzofuranil 4 n butylaminomethyl 2 p chlor ophenyl 1, 3 dioxolane. Should in any instance the reaction has not been coitiplete, most of the unreacted product may be elliminated by precipitation with cyclohexane and if necessary carrying out a previous distillation at 130 deg. C and 10 mm Hg to remove the more volatile components. Examples of the preparation procedure for obtaining the new dioxolanic amine of formula I ITA 362 and its salts are described below, this being the second stage thereof, with all the details not affecting the essentiality of the invention being variables and not limitive to the same.Example 1.

Equally corresponds to the reference ITA 362 A solution of 266 g 0,676 m of 2 2 benzofuranil 4 bromomethyl 2 p chlorophenyl 1,3 dioxolane and 400 cc 4,06 m of n butylamine in 1000 cc of anhydrous toluene is set to boil during 30 h. By means of TLC eluent AcOEt the progress of the reaction can be controlled. Leave to cool and quickly add 330 cc of NaOH 2N and stir during 30 minutes. Decant, sh thoroughly the organic phase with water to remove the excess n butylamine and elliminate the the solvent at a low pressure, obtaining 255 g 98 of a very thick reddish oil.This product is of a quality suitable fa the subsequent preparation of the salts. If required, further purification may be carried out by molecular distillation 2 at 175 deg.C and 3 4.10 mm Hg yielding 221 g 85 of a very thick yellowish oil.Potentiometric evaluation of basic groups 103 IR film characteristic bands at 1600, 1450, 1250, 1090, 830 and 755 cm l NMR CDCl3 6 7,80 6,85 m, 8, aromatics 670 and 6,55 two singlets corresponding to the furanic proton for the cis and trans isomers 4,80 3,80 m, 3, O CH2 CH 0 3,00 2,45 m, 4, CH2NH CH2 1,80 0,70 m, 7, CH2CH2CH3 . The aminic proton may appear as a singlet with i approx. 2,22,5 or even included within the other signals in this zone in the form of a wide signal.EM molecular peak at m e 385.The preparation of salts of the 2 2 benzofuranil 4 n butylaminemethyl 2 p chlorphenyl 1 ,3 dioxolane. ITA 362 Because the ITA 362 base is an oil it is more convenient for its manipulation and usage to be converted to a solid salt by treating it with a suitable acid. Due to the instability of the dioxolanic compounds in an acqueous acid medium it is preferable to use for its salification weak acids such as maleic, citric, orotic, acetic, fumaric, oxalic, malonic, p toluensulphonic, or similar in any adequate organic solvent such as acetone, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, chloroform ethyl acetate, benzene and in general any solvent which would adequately dissolve the amine.When the acid used has at the same time geometric or optical isomerism, in the formation of the corresponding salt, one of the two diastereoisomers may be preferably separated by crystallization. Such is the case with maleate of which we detail the preparation below by way of example, with the analytical physical data of the other salts as well. Example 2. Preparation of the maleate of the ITA 362. rO a solution of 166 g 0,43 m of ITA 362 in 400 cc of acet one at 40 50 deg.C is added . 50 g 0,434 m of maleic acid dissolved in acetone at the same temperature. The mixture is stirred and immediately a white solid starts separating out antil it forms a compact mass.

While in the base both signals have a similar intensity, with only the most deshielcled being slightly more intense, 10 20 in the salt this signal clearly predominates with respect to the other in a proportion of 3 1.
