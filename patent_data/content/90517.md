# Gear retainer.

## Abstract
An improved mainshaft gear retainer assembly 66, 68 for a multiple countershaft 18, 18A transmission 10 hav ing at least one pair of floating mainshaft gears 44 46, 48 50 positioned axially close together in groups of two and clutchable to a mainshaft 40 one at a time by positive clutches 54, 56, 58 is provided. The improved mainshaft gear retainer assembly prevents axial movement of the two closely positioned gears and reacts the axial forces on a clutched one of the mainshaft gears toward and away from the other mainshaft gear to the mainshaft by means of thrust surfaces 46D 82B, 82C 78C, 78D 74B, 74C 70, or 94B 82C, 82B 84 which are all rotating, or tending to rotate, at the same speed as the clutched mainshaft gear and the mainshaft. The gear retainer comprises relatively simple components and allows easy assembly and disassembly of the mainshaft gears and gear retainers from the mainshaft. Each of the closely speaced mainshaft gears and certain associated retainer components defines a subassembly 44, 76 and 90 and 46, 82 and 94 which is independently assembled to and removed from the mainhaft assembly 20 . The improved retainer assembly components are all received in the circumferential space defined by the root diameter 42A of the mainshaft splines 42 and the root diameter 44B and 46B of the gear internal clutch teeth 44A and 46A .
