# TOOL HOLDER

## Abstract
A tool holder for a portable tool, for example a rotary hammer, has a rotatable drive sleeve 8 adapted to receive therein a tool 22 and having a pair of diametrically opposed slots 24, 25 disposed axially along parts of its length. A key 44 extends inwardly into each slot and is movable through its slot for retaining and rotatably driving the tool. The slots 24, 25 have an axial length greater than that of the keys 44 which are slidable axially there along. A locking collar 66 , having an internal surface diverging progressively outwardly over at least a portion 70 of its length in the axial direction, encircles the sleeve 8 and is movable axially in one direction for locking the keys 44 in engagement with the tool 22 , and in the opposite direction to allow disengagement of the tool. The action of the divergent surface portion 70 on the keys 44 enables the keys to be locked in position over a range of inward penetrations to accommodate tools having driving recesses of different depths. A stop member 30 is rotatable on the sleeve between two positions which cause the slots 24, 25 to have a shorter or longer effective length, respec tively, to change the tool holder from rotary only mode to hammer mode. A coil spring 62 urges the locking collar 66 away from the stop member 30 . A circumferential spring 56 may be incorporated to urge the keys 44 radially inwards, inward motion being limited by shoulders 52 on the keys.
