# Carrier for material during electrolytic finishing.

## Abstract
A carrier for supporting extended metal workpieces during electrolytic finishing treatments comprises a flight bar supporting at least two dependent spline members both the flight bar and the spine members being electrically con nected to the workpieces supported by the carrier. Each spline has two or more support arms for the workpieces and a clamp bar, carrying spaced clamp arms arranged at the same vertical interval as the support arms, is arranged for vertical movement in relation to each spline and is employed to clamp the workpiece in electrical contact with the upper or lower side of the adjacent support arm.
