## Description
This invention relates to an epoxy resin composition to be used for producing molded insulating products as component parts of various electrical apparatuses and appliances. Cured products composed of epoxy resin and various acid anhydrides are highly excellent in their electrical, mechanical and chemical properties, hence they are widely used as the epoxy resin molded insulating products for the manufacture of electrical apparatuses and appliances as well as power transmission and distribution apparatuses and appliances. As a method for shortening mold releasing time in the manufacture of such epoxy resin molded product with a view to improving its productivity by use of less number of metal molds, there has so far been known generally pressure gelating method . This method of manufacturing the epoxy resin molded product comprises steps of maintaining a mixture of the resin composition in a pressure tank at a low temperature, and then, at the time of molding, pouring the mixture of the resin composition directly into the metal mold kept at a higher temperature than the the resin mixture through a molding head, while maintaining the mold under pressure so as to accelerate curing and shrinking of the resin in a short time, thereby obtaining the required products. In this case, the mixture of the epoxy resin to be used is required to have a low viscosity in the pressure tank, a long useful working time, and further a rapid curing speed within the metal mold at a high temperature. General characteristics of epoxy resins are such that those indicating a low viscosity at a low temperature have a low molecular weight, on account of which they have an extremely large coefficient of contraction due to curing, hence the cured products tend to readily bring about various deficiencies such as loss, cracks, and so forth, while those having quick reactivity at a high temperature have a property of reacting relatively easily even at a low temperature, hence their useful working time becomes shorter. To solve these problems, there have generally been taken various measures such that, for preventing the cured products from such loss or cracks to occur during the curing step, the pressure gelating method is adopted, and, for prolonging the useful working time, a latent promotor is used. However, the low molecular weight epoxy resins indicating a low viscosity at a low temperature are inferior in their heat shock resisting property to that of the solid or high viscosity epoxy resins which are well used in the ordinary molding method other than the pressure gelating method. As the method for improving the heat shock resisting property of the epoxy resins having a low viscosity, there has so far been known a method, in which a flexibility imparting agent such as, for example, high molecular weight oligomers having a molecular weight of from 500 to 5,000 or so and containing polyether, polybutadiene, etc. in the principal chain thereof is added to the epoxy resin. This method, however, considerably increases viscosity of the epoxy resin with increase in the adding quantity of such high molecular weight oligomer, and, further, its heat resistant property also decreases remarkably. On the contrary, when the adding quantity of the high molecular weight oligomer is small, the heat shock resisting property hardly improves. In connection with this, such a flexibility imparting agent as that which does not so much increase viscosity of the resin mixture such as one containing therein polyamide in its principal chain has high reactivity, hence the useful working time becomes short. Since the conventional epoxy resin composition is so constructed as described in the foregoing, it has the point of problem such that, for securing the high viscosity and the long useful working time at the low temperature condition in the pressure gelation method, and the rapid curing speed at the high temperature condition in such pressure gelation method, any of the heat resistant property and the heat shock resisting property of the low viscosity epoxy resin should be sacrificed. The present invention has been made with a view to solving such point of problem as mentioned in the preceding, and aims at providing an epoxy resin composition capable of maintaining its heat resistant property, while exhibiting its excellent heat shock resisting property. The epoxy resin composition according to the present invention is characterized in that it consists essentially of an epoxy resin having an epoxy equivalent of 200 or lower a mixture of polybasic carboxylic acid anhydride and aromatic ester as a curing agent and inorganic powder as a filler, wherein the aromatic ester is a mixture of a monoester to be represented by the following general formula I and a diester to be represented by the following general formula II the mixture containing therein 0.5 to 0.95 mol of the monoester represented by the general formula I and 0.05 to 0.5 mol of the diester represented by the general formula II , and R₁, R₂ and R₃ in the general formulae being saturated or unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbon group containing therein 6 to 8 carbon atoms. The present invention will now be described in specific details hereinbelow with reference to preferred examples of obtaining the epoxy resin composition with improved heat resistant property and heat shock resisting property, when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawing, in which the single figure is a graphical representation showing change with lapse of time in viscosity at 60 As the epoxy resin having its epoxy equivalent of 200 or below to be used for the present invention, any type of epoxy resin may be used, provided that it is in liquid form at a low temperature 20 As the polybasic carboxylic acid anhydride to be used for the present invention, any kind of such acid anhydrides may be used, provided that it is in liquid form at a low temperature 20 Further, the aromatic esters represented by the general formulae I and II to be used as the curing agent in the present invention, they are perfectly suited for the purpose, if they contain therein saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon group having 6 to 8 carbon atoms in each of R₁, R₂ and R₃ of the general formulae I and II . Examples of such aromatic esters are cyclohexane ring, methyl substituted cyclohexane ring, benzene ring, cyclohexene ring and methyl substituted cyclohexene ring. By use of the above mentioned aromatic esters, the heat shock resisting property of the cured product of the epoxy resin composition according to the prsent invention attains its improvement. It should, however, be noted that, when the mixture of the esters is composed of 0.5 mol or lower of the monoester represented by the general formula I and 0.5 mol or higher of the diester represented by the formula II , viscosity of the mixture per se increases with the result that the working efficiency at the time of its weight measurement becomes poor. This reflects on increase in the viscosity of the resin mixture itself, hence its useful working time becomes short. Furthermore, when the mixture of the ester is composed of 0.95 mol or higher of the monoester represented by the general formula I and 0.05 mol or below of the diester represented by the general formula II , the epoxy resin composition using such mixture of esters is not able to obtain its high Deflection temperature under flexural load H.D.T. . As the inorganic powder to be used as the filler in the present invention, any kind of such inorganic powder may be used, if it does not lower the electrical and mechanical properties of the cured product of the epoxy resin composition. Examples of such inorganic powder are alumina powder, hydrated alumina powder, quartz powder and fused quartz powder. The method for manufacturing the molded product using the epoxy resin composition according to the present invention comprises steps of mixing, at a temperature of from 20 The accelerator to be added to the epoxy resin composition may be chosen from, for example, organic carboxylic acid metal salts such as, for example, zinc octylate, tertiary amine, boron trifluoride amine complex and imidazoles. The added quantity of the accelerator is so adjusted that the curing may be completed in a time period of from 1 to 30 minutes at the metal mold temperature of from 90 Furthermore, the epoxy resin composition according to the present invention may be added with a coloring agent, a coupling agent or internal mold releasing agent, provided that such additives do not lower various characteristics of the resin composition such as viscosity, long useful working time, rapid curing speed of the resin mixture, as well as high heat deformation temperature and heat shock resisting property, of the cured product.
