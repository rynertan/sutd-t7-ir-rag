# Modular nuclear steam supply system and method of constructing a nuclear reactor using a modular nuclear steam supply system.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for fabricating a nuclear reactor together with a performed containment building for a nuclear reactor. The nuclear steam supply system NSSS is assembled at a manufacturing site while the containment building is constructed in parallel at the reactor site. The completed NSSS is taken transported to the reactor site and installed in the specially formed containment building be coming part thereof. The NSSS and its safeguards system preferably are formed as a low draft barge which is tugged to the reactor site along navigable waterways.
