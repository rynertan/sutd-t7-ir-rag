# Self tensioning motor transmission control system.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a self tensioning motor transmission control system 34 having a manually positioned driver member 4 that moves planarly to remotely move a driven member 14 that is operably connected to a gear change mechanism and moves planarly to effect a change in the transmission gears by means of a plurality of flexible force transmitting members, such as cables 7, 8, 9 , that are connected to the driver 4 and driven members 14 in such a manner that the force transmitting members are self tensioning and are subjected only to tensional pulling forces.
