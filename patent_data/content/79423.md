# Catalytic gas reformer.

## Abstract
Slab shaped high efficiency catalytic reformer configura tions particularly useful for generation of fuels such as hydrogen or carbon monoxide to be used in fuel cell based generation systems. A plurality of structures 20, 22, 26 forming a generally rectangular peripheral envelope are spaced about one another to form annular regions, an interior annular 24 region containing a catalytic bed 38 and being regeneratively heated on one side by a hot combustion gas 28 and on the other side by the gaseous products 18 of the reformation. An integrally mounted combustor 30 is cooled by impingement of incoming oxidant through a plurality of openings 119 . These slab shaped reformer configurations provide increased heat transfer and increased hydrogen generation while decreas ing waste heat, size and undesirable products.
