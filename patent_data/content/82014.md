# Tape cassette adapter.

## Abstract
A tape cassette adapter which is useful for a tape recording and or reproducing apparatus such as a video tape recorder and draws a tape out a compact cassette by the movement of tape drawing mechanism from an inoperative position to an operative position. The tape cassette adapter comprises an engage member which engages to rotate synchronously with a take up reel drive shaft of the standard size magnetic tape cassette apparatus, a take up reel drive mechanism for rotating the take up reel of the compact cassette, and a joint mechanism of rotational power transmission between the rotational member and the take up reel drive mechanism. Consequently the tape cassette adapter is able to be mounted on apparatuses smoothly even if the position of the take up reel drive shaft deviates from regular position.
