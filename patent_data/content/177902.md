## Description
This invention relates to a digital to analog converter for converting digital data into an analog output signal V In a signal reproduction circuit of a digital audio device such as a compact disc player, a digital signal reproduced from a recording medium is converted into an analog signal. In such a case, since the digital reproduction signal generally takes the form of a binary fixed point number, a digital to analog converter hereinafter referred to as D A converter of the type in which all bits of the digital reproduction signal are directly supplied to a weighted register network or an R 2R resistor ladder network is generally used. As is well known, one of the most important features of a digital audio device is the reproducibility of a small signal with less distortion. It is also well known that distortion contained in the output signal of a D A converter of this type increases with the decrease of magnitude of the input data. And therefore, for example, when it is desired to reproduce a signal at a level of 60 dB full scale level is 0 dB with a distortion less than 1 , the D A converter must have such a high accuracy that a signal at a level of 0 dB can be reproduced with a distortion less than 0.001 , which accuracy is equivalent to fifteen to sixteen bits. However, it is extremely difficult to improve the accuracy of a D A converter of this type to such an extent. US A 4 278 964 teaches a seismic playback system and especially an apparatus for converting wide dynamic amplitude range digital data recorded in floating point digital word form, comprising a binary coded mantissa and a binary coded exponent, to an analog signal, or oscillogram, of selectively compressed and or amplified dynamic amplitude range. The digital word, occupying a number of binary bit positions, is, in algebraic form In Elektronik , Vol. 31, No. 3, February 1982, pages 78 80, floating point D A converters of high quantization accuracy are described in a general manner. This reference discloses further that the exponent is set at 2 and the D A converter provides a r 2r ladder network. U. Tietze Ch. Schenk Halbleiter Schaltungstechnik , 5th edition, Springer Verlag Berlin Heidelberg New York 1980, pages 633 638 discloses a r 2r ladder network in a general theoretical treatment. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a D A converter, which can convert a digital signal under high speed operation into an analog signal with less distortion, even, when the magnitude of the digital input signal is small. The digital to analog converter according to the invention is characterized in that said circuit means comprises an r 2r ladder network directly connected at one terminal end thereof to said one terminal end of said mantissa digital to analog converting means for producing said second analog signals, wherein said r 2r resistor ladder network is supplied at one terminal of each 2r resistor thereof with a bias voltage to determine the center of range of said analog output signal. According to the invention the bias voltage corresponding to the center value of the amplitude of the output analog signal is applied at the connection point between the exponent part and mantissa part, which are connected in series. Thus it is possible to omit the buffer amplifier, which is inserted between the exponent part and mantissa part of the conventional D A converter. As a result it is possible to obtain a high speed response, when converting the digital into the analog signal with less distortions even when the magnitude of the digital input signal is small. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention the digital to analog converter is provided with data converting means for converting a fixed point binary data into a floating point data composed of said mantissa and exponent part. So the D A converter according to this preferred embodiment lends itself also to the conversion of a digital input data in the form of a fixed point number. Further advantageous embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Referring now to Fig. 1, there is shown a D A converter 100 provided in accordance with the present invention. This D A converter 100 is of a floating point type which can implement a digital to analog conversion of a small signal with less distortion as will become apparent from the following description. Shown at TD₉ to TD₀ in Fig. 1 are input terminals for being supplied respectively with bits D₉ to D₀ of a ten bit mantissa part or fractional part of a floating point digital input data to be converted into an analog signal, the bit D₉ being the MSB most significant bit of the mantissa part. Each bit of the input data is supplied to a ten stage R 2R resistor ladder network 10 through serially connected two inverters 11 and 12. Each stage of the ladder network 10 comprises a 2R resistor composed of serially connected two resistors each having a resistance value of R, which are disposed transversely of the ladder, and an R resistor composed of a resistor having a resistance value of R which is disposed longitudinally of the ladder. In this case, the bits D₉ to D₀ of the input data are fed respectively to the 2R resistors of the first MSB to tenth stages of the ladder network 10. Each of the inverters 11 and 12 is equivalent to an analog switch circuit shown in Fig. 2 which is so arranged that a voltage of V Shown at 102 is a D A conversion section for converting a three bit exponent part of the digital input data. This D A conversion section 102 analogically shifts the output voltage appearing at the other terminal end 18 of the ladder network 10 on the MSB side by an amount of voltage determined by the magnitude of the exponent part. The D A conversion section 102 comprises a six stage r r 2 resistor ladder network 20 and seven analog switches SW₀ to SW₆ each comprising a field effect transistor hereinafter referred to as FET . Each stage of the ladder network 20 except for the LSB stage comprises a 1 2r resister composed of parallel connected two resisters each having a resistance value of As is appreciated from the formula 2 , with the structure of the above described floating point type D A converter 100, a dynamic range of ten bits can be obtained by the mantissa part and a dynamic range of six bits can be obtained by the exponent part. And therefore, this D A converter 100 as a whole has a resolution of sixteen bits. Moreover, when the N is 6 , that is, when the exponent part is minimum, an error contained in the output voltage V Although the floating point type D A converter 100 has various advantages as described above, the input data to be applied thereto must be in the form of a floating point number. And therefore, in the case where the data to be converted into an analog signal is ordinary binary data or data in a fixed point form, the input data must be converted into data in a floating point form. This is, however, troublesome. A D A converter 200 modified so that ordinary fixed point binary data can be directly applied will now be described. In Fig. 3, a digital input data of sixteen binary weighted bits M₁₅ to M₀ in two s complement form is supplied to input terminals IN₁₅ to IN₀ of the D A converter 200. The MSB M₁₅ sign bit of the digital input data supplied to the input terminal IN₁₅ is inverted by an inverter 105 and fed to an input terminal TD₉ of a mantissa part D A conversion section 101 through serially connected two inverters 11 and 12. The remaining bits M₁₄ to M₀ supplied to the input terminals IN₁₄ to IN₀ are fed to input terminals I₁₄ to I₀ of a data shift circuit 106, respectively. Also, the bits M₁₅ to M₉ of the input data are supplied to input terminals I₁₅ to I₉ of a shift number detection circuit 107. This shift number detection circuit 107 selectively outputs one of seven signals P₀ to P₆ to the data shift circuit 106 and an exponent part D A conversion section 102 in accordance with the bits M₁₅ to M₉ of the input data. As shown in Fig. 4, the shift number detection circuit 107 comprises six exclusive OR gates 109 to 114 to which the bits M₉ to M₁₄ are supplied, respectively, at one input terminals thereof. The other input terminals of the exclusive OR gates 109 to 114 are supplied with the bit M₁₅ of the input data. This shift number detection circuit 107 further comprises seven AND gates AN₀ to AN₆. Input terminals of each of the AND gates AN₀ to AN₆ are indicated by circles on an input signal line of the corresponding one of the AND gates. Output terminals of the exclusive OR gates 114 to 109 are connected to the first input terminals of the AND gates AN₀ to AN₅, respectively. The output terminals of the exclusive OR gates 109 to 114 are also connected to input terminals of inverters 116 to 121, respectively. An output terminal of the inverter 116 is connected to the first input terminal of the AND gate AN₆, and an output terminal of the inverter 117 is connected to the second input terminals of the AND gates AN₅ and AN₆. An output terminal of the inverter 118 is connected to the second input terminal of the AND gate AN₄ and the third input terminals of the AND gates AN₅ and AN₆. In a similar manner, an output terminal of the inverter 119 is connected to the input terminals of the AND gates AN₃ to AN₆, an output terminal of the inverter 120 to the input terminals of AND gates AN₂ to AN₆, and an output terminal of the inverter 121 to the input terminals of the AND gates AN₁ to AN₆. When opened, the AND gates AN₀ to AN₆ output the signal P₀ to P₆, respectively. With this shift number detection circuit 107, when the bit M₁₅ is 0 , that is to say, when the input data of this D A converter 200 is a positive value, the N of the outputted signal P The data shift circuit 106 shown in Fig. 3 selects, based on the signal P In this embodiment, all of the above described circuits are formed in a single chip of semiconductor. The operation of this D A converter 200 will now be described. When a digital input data of sixteen bits M₁₅ to M₀ is supplied to the input terminals IN₁₅ to IN₀, the shift number detection circuit 107 determines, in accordance with the bits M₁₅ to M₉ of the input data, the number of bit N N is one of 0 to 6 the data shift circuit 106 should shift the input data, and outputs the signal P With this D A converter 200, in the case where the absolute value of the input data represented by the bits M₁₄ to M₀ thereof is large, only higher significant bits of the input data are supplied to the mantissa part D A conversion section 101 and the remaining lower significant bits thereof are neglected. In this case, however, the value represented by the neglected bits is sufficiently smaller than that represented by all of the bits M₁₄ to M₀, and therefore, the neglect of the lower significant bits has little effect on the output voltage V As described above, with the structure of this D A converter 200, an error in D A conversion at a small signal level is minimized, and the input digital data to be converted into an analog form may be applied thereto in the form of an ordinary fixed point binary data, i. e., data composed only of binary weighted bits. Furthermore, this D A converter 200 can easily be formed on a single chip of semiconductor to eliminate noise interference from the exterior circuits and to reduce its manufacturing cost. The D A converter thus formed in a single chip of semiconductor is easy to use since digital data in the form of an ordinary binary data can be directly applied to the digital data input terminals thereof. Though the described embodiments are examples in which a ten bit mantissa section and a six bit exponent section cooperatively convert sixteen bit digital data, the present invention is not limited thereto and each of the mantissa section and the exponent section may handle digital data of other bit structure to convert the sixteen bit digital data or to convert digital data other than sixteen bits.
