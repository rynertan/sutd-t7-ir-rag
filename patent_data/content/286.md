# Apparatus for continuously patterning a photosensitive tape by projection printing.

## Abstract
A method and an apparatus for continuously patterning a photosensitive tape 1 or foil wherein a master pattern 8 and the tape 1 or foil are synchronously rotated for continually projecting a sequence of images representative of the pattern onto the tape via the optical system 11 . The optical system, comprising a plano convex lens 111 , a concave spherical mirror 112 , and a pair of right angle prisms 113, 114 , is optically coupled between the master pattern and the tape or foil for projecting an image of the pattern onto the tape. The optical system is such that the movement of the image is in the same direction as the movement of the tape. The apparatus is such that patterning can take place through projecting an image on one or on both sides of the tape. Alternatively, projecting an image on one side of the tape and contact printing of a pattern on the other side of the tape is also made possible by the apparatus.
