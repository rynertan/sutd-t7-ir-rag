## Description
The present invention is directed to novel substituted aniline compounds, the optically active isomers of said compounds, compositions containing said compounds, and the use of these compounds in the selective kill and control of grassy weeds in the presence of valuable crop plants. The active compounds of the present invention correspond to the formula The compounds of Formula I most preferred are those compounds wherein a is 0, n represents an integer of from 1 to 3, p is 0 and Z represents The term C₁ C₄ alkyl as employed in the present specification and claims designates alkyl groups which can be straight or branched chain containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms or cycloalkyl of 3 or 4 carbon atoms. In the present invention, it is to be noted that all substituent groups are sterically compatible with each other. The term sterically compatible is employed to designate substituent groups which are not affected by steric hindrance as defined in The Condensed Chemical Dictionary , 7th edition, Reinhold Publishing Co., N.Y., page 893 1966 which definition is as follows steric hindrance. A characteristic of molecular structure in which the molecules have a spatial arrangement of their atoms such that a given reac tion with another molecule is prevented or retarded in rate. Steric hindrance may be further defined as compounds having substituents whose physical bulk does not require confinement within volumes insufficient for the exercise of their normal behavior as discussed in Organic Chemistry of D. J. Cram and G. Hammon, 2nd edition, McGraw Hill Book Company, N.Y., page 215 1964 . The compounds of the present invention contain the optically active center A general discussion of the isomer activity difference phenomenon can be found in A. Albert, Selective Toxicity, 4th ed., Met Luen Co., Ltd., London, 1968, pp. 387 390 and more particular discussions in A. Fredga and B. Åberg, Stereoisomerism in plant growth regulators of the auxin type , Ann. Rev. Plant Physiology 16 53 72, 1965 and in E. J. Lien, J. F. R. DeMiranda and E. J. Airens, Quantitative structure activity correlation of optical isomers , Molecular Pharmacology 12 598 604, 1976. The compounds produced by the process of the present invention are generally solid materials having low mammalian toxicity. The compounds are substantially insoluble in water and moderately soluble in common organic solvents. The compounds of the present invention, herein after referred to as active compounds or active ingredi ents , have been found to be active as herbicides for the pre and postemergent kill and control of undesirable vegetation, for example, grassy or graminaceous weeds and especially for the postemergent control of these weeds in the presence of crop plants including corn, soybeans, wheat, sugar beets, rice and cotton. The present invention encompasses herbicidal compositions containing one or more of these active ingredients as well as methods of controlling said unde sired weed plant growth, especially in the presence of said crop plants and especially in postemergent opera tions. Such methods comprise applying a herbicidally effective amount of one or more of said active ingredi ents to the locus of the undesired plants, i.e., the above ground portions of the plants. The term herbicide is used herein to mean an active ingredient which controls or adversely modifies the growth of plants because of phytotoxic or other effects substantial enough to seriously retard the growth of the plant or further to damage the plant sufficiently to kill the plant. The terms growth controlling or herbicidally effective amount are employed to designate an amount of active ingredient which causes a modifying effect and includes deviations from natural development, killing, regulation, dessication, retardation, and the like. The term plants means established vegetation. The terms control or controlling as it relates to plant growth has the same meaning as employed hereinabove for the term herbicide .

In addition, the present compounds are sufficiently tolerant toward most broadleafed and some grass crops, such as, for example, soybeans, cotton, sugar beets, corn, rice and wheat, to allow for the post emergent control of grassy weeds growing among said crops. It is to be noted that not all compounds will have the same effect on all plants. Some compounds will be more active in the control of one weed specie than another and some compounds will be more selective toward one crop specie than another. For such uses, unmodified active ingredients of the present invention can be employed. However, the present invention also embraces the use of the active compounds in admixture with inert materials, known in the art as an agricultural adjuvants and or carriers, in solid or liquid form. Thus, for example, an active ingredient can be dispersed on a finely divided solid and employed therein as a dust or granule. Also, the active ingredients, as liquid concentrates or solid compositions comprising one or more of the active ingredients can be dispersed in water, typically with aid of a wetting agent, and the resulting aqueous dispersion employed as a spray. In other procedures, the active ingredients can be employed as a constituent of organic liquid composi tions, oil in water and water in oil emulsions or water dispersions, with or without the addition of wetting, dispersing, or emulsifying agents. Suitable adjuvants of the foregoing type are well known to those skilled in the art. The herbicidally effective concentration of the active ingredients in solid or liquid compositions gener ally is from about 0.0003 to about 95 percent by weight or more. Concentrations from about 0.05 to about 50 percent by weight are often employed. In compositions to be employed as concentrates, the active ingredient can be present in a concentration from about 5 to about 98 weight percent. The active ingredient compositions can also contain other compatible additaments, for example, phytotoxicants, plant growth regulants and other biologi cally active compounds used in agriculture. In further embodiments, the compounds of the present invention or compositions containing the same, can be advantageously employed in combination with one or more additional pesticidal compounds. Such additional pesticidal compounds may be insecticides, nematocides, miticides, arthropodicides, herbicides, fungicides or bactericides that are compatible with the compounds of the present invention in the medium selected for applica tion and not antagonistic to the activity of the present compounds. Accordingly, in such embodiments, the pesti cidal compound is employed as a supplemental toxicant for the same or for a different pesticidal use or as an additament. The compounds in combination can generally be present in a ratio of from 1 to 100 parts of the compound of the present invention with from 100 to 1 part of the additional compound s . The active ingredients of the present invention have been found to possess desirable postemergent activity against grassy weeds such as foxtail, barnyard grass, wild oats, Johnson grass and crabgrass while showing high selectivity to important broadleaf crops such as cotton, sugar beets and soybeans and grassy crops such as wheat, rice and corn. These compounds are also uniquely effec tive in selectively controlling perennial grassy weeds such as Johnson grass, quackgrass, and bermuda grass. The exact amount of the active material to be applied is dependent not only on the specific active ingredient being applied, but also on the particular action desired, the plant species to be controlled and the stage of growth thereof as well as the part of the plant to be contacted with the toxic active ingredient. Thus, all of the active ingredients of the present inven tion and compositions containing the same may not be equally effective at similar concentrations or against the same plant species. In preemergent operations a dosage rate of 0.01 to 10 lbs acre 0.011 to 11.2 kgs hectare , preferably 0.05 to 2.0 lbs acre 0.056 to 2.25 kgs hectare and most preferably 0.1 to 1 lb acre 0.11 to 1.12 kgs hectare is generally employed. In postemergent operations a dosage of about 0.01 to about 20 lbs acre 0.056 22.4 kg hectare is generally applicable, although not all compounds are equally effective and some weeds are more difficult to control. Thus, a dosage rate in the range of about 0.05 to about 1.0 lb acre 0.01 1.12 kg hectare is preferred in postemergent control of annual grassy weeds, while about 0.05 to about 5 lbs acre 0.056 5.6 kg hectare is a preferred dosage range for the postemergent control of perennial grassy weeds. In applications to tolerant crops a weed controlling but less than crop damaging amount of from about .005 to about 1.0 lb acre 0.0056 to 1.12 kgs hectare is generally employed.
