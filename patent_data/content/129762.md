# POLYPHENYLENE ETHER RESIN COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING HALOGENATED AROMATIC COMPOUND ALONE AS A FLAME RETARDANT AGENT

## Abstract
Flame retardant compositions comprising admixtures of polyphenylene ether resin, a polyalkenyl aromatic and as the sole flame retardant agent, a halogenated aromatic com pound or mixture of such compounds, are described. These provide decided advantages over corresponding flame retar dant compositions containing synergistic agents and or aromatic phosphate flame retardants, alone, or in combina tion with halogenated aromatics. They are useful for shaping into a wide variety of articles for industrial or household pur poses.
