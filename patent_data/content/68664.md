# A heme protein immobilized electrode.

## Abstract
An electrode comprising a solid electrically con ducting material at least partly coated by a monolayer of cytochrome c₃ is useful for the direct electrochemical reduction of molecular oxygen to water in accordance with the reaction O₂ 4e 4H 2H₂O and for the electrolysis of water to produce oxygen and hydrogen. Cytochrome c₃ is easily obtained from a Desulfovibrio microorganism.
