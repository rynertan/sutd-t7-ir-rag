# Bypass water conditioner.

## Abstract
A device for the magnetic treatment of liquids, par ticurally water, wherein a bypass chamber is provided so that only a portion of the liquid passing through the conditioner is subjected to the magnetic fieid. The device comprises one or more elongate magnetic cores each having an elongate magnet 12 encased within a tubular inner casing 14 of non magnetic material. The magnetic core is received within an elongate intermediate casing 22 of magnetic material, such as an iron or steel gal vanized pipe, and being radially spaced therefrom so as to form a generally annular treatment chamber 34 hav ing an inlet at one end and an outlet at the opposite end. The intermediate casing, since it is formed of a magnetic material, provides a return path for the mag netic field produced by the magnet to confine the magnetic field substantially to the treatment chamber. An outer casing 38 encircles the intermediate casing and is spaced from the intermediate casing around at least a portion of the periphery of the intermediate casing to form therebetween a bypass chamber 60 having an inlet and an outlet. The bypass and treatment chambers are arranged such that they form respective parallel flow paths for the liquid flowing through the conditioner whereby a portion of the liquid flows through the treatment chamber and is treated by the magnetic field and the remainder of the liquid flows through the bypass chamber and is not subjected to the magnetic field. The device is particularly adapted to be connected in water system wherein a major portion of the water is recirculated continuously through the conditioner so that only a small portion of the water need be treated at any one time.
