# CUTTING TOOL WEAR MONITOR

## Abstract
A method and apparatus by which the degree of wear and useful life limitations of a drill, end mill or other types of boring or turning tools can be detected. The method is based on the short circuit current, open circuit voltage and or power that is generated during drilling, boring, etc. by the utilization of an insulated rotary tool bit 17 to which electrical contact is made by a non rotating conductor 37,39 and an insulated or non insulated workpiece, with an external circuit 41,42 connecting the tool and workpiece 11 through a measuring device 43 . The generated current, voltage or power shows a sharp increase or change in slope upon considerable tool wear or failure.
