# Continuous process for the production of peroxycarboxylic acid compositions.

## Abstract
Peroxycarboxylic acid compositions containing stabilizing ingredients are produced by the hydrogen peroxide peroxidation of corresponding carboxylic acids which are not substantially soluble in water by a continuous process in which the peroxida tion reaction takes place in solution in concentrated sulfuric acid, or other strong acid, while that solution is intimately interdis persed, by means of agitation, with methylene chloride, or other organic solvent, in which the resulting peroxycarboxylic acid is soluble, but the carboxylic acid is not, and the sulfuric acid, or other acid, is recovered from the effluent of the process by reacting in with borax and caustic soda or soda ash to from crystals of boric acid and sodium salt of the strong acid which, in admixture with peroxycarboxylic acid recovered from the effluent, form the peroxycarboxylic acid composition product. The methy lene chloride is also recovered from the effluent and recycled to the process.
