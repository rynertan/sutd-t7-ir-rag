## Abstract
Apparatus and process for writing video information in the form of a frequency modulated signal upon a disc member and for retrieving the recorded information. The disc member 10 formed by the writing apparatus is also described. The apparatus includes a laser 30 as a source of write light beam 29 and a write optical system for directing the focused beam to a moving disc member. The member comprises a substrate carrying a light responsive coating 26 at least on one surface. The write optical system includes an optical modulator 44 that charges the intensity of the write laser beam with respect to a predetermined threshold intensity sufficient to form a first type of indicia in the coating and a feedback apparatus that stabilises the operating level of said modulator. The read optical system includes a light sensing circuit 158 for changing the intensity modulated reflected light beam to a corresponding electrical signal. A triangular frequency modulator Figure 14C for driving a Pockels cell 68 , for obtaining a sinusoidal shaped light modulation output signal from the linear polariser 70 and a bias circuit 264 employed for removing the second harmonic intermodulation distortion of the modulated write beam, are described.
