# Method and apparatus for measuring the level of a fluent material in a container.

## Abstract
In a method of measuring the level of a flowing material kept in a container there is employed a microwave signal that is fed from a transmitter through a tubular waveguide 7 that extends vertically downwardly through the container and communicates therewith so that the surface 10 of the ma terial in the waveguide follows the level of the surrounding material. The signal is reflected from the surface back up through the waveguide and is conducted to a receiver to be employed, after signal processing in an electronic unit, for determining the level of material in the container. The mi crowave signal is fed to the waveguide by way of a mode generator 11 that produces only one dominant propagation mode of the signal, the wavelength of which is smaller than the diameter of the waveguide 7 .
