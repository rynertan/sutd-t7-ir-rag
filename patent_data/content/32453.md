# Apparatus for intermittently feeding a workpiece to a machine.

## Abstract
An input shaft 14 of a press feed is rotated at a pre selected speed and is drivingly connected to a cam 20 that rotates with the input shaft 14 . Continuous rotation of the cam 20 is converted to oscillating rotational movement of a cam follower 22 through a preselected angle of rotation. The cam follower 22 is nonrotatably connected to an output shaft 28 that is connected by an adjustable linkage mechan ism 42 through a pair of meshing gears 90,124 to a driven feed roll 16 . The oscillating rotational movement of the output shaft 28 is transmitted to the driven feed roll 16 to advance the driven feed roll 16 in contact with stock mater ial through a preselected degree of rotation corresponding to a preselected feed length of the stock material to the press. The feed length is adjustable by changing the length of travel of the linkage mechanism 42 with respect to the degree of rotation of the output shaft 28 . The driven feed roll 16 rotates through a preselected angle in a first direction to feed a selected material, remains stationary during a first dwell period, is released from the material and rotates in the oppo site direction back to the initial feed position, remains statio nary for a second dwell period, and engages the material for another feed cycle. The intermittent feeding operation is co ordinated with the operations of feed roll release and stock material clamping.
