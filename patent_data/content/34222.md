# Process for the removal of protein from waste water and precipitate recovered by this process.

## Abstract
A process for the removal of protein from waste water, which comprises adding to the waste water a water soluble carboxymethyl cellulose, which in by weight solution in water at 25 C has a viscosity determined in a Brookfield vis cometer from 25 to 900 centipoise, and removing the precipi tate formed.

A process according to any one of the preceding claims, in which the amount of carboxymethyl cellulose added is 5 15 w on total protein present. 5. A precipitate obtained according to any one of the preceding claims.

## Description
PROCESS FOR THE REMOVAL OF PROTEIN FROM WASTE WATER AND PRECIPITATE RECOVERED BY THIS PROCESS The invention relates to a process for the removal of protein from waste water and to precipitate recovered by this process. Valuable proteins are discharged to waste in many industrial effluent waste water streams. These arise mainly from washings of machinery and floors in animal slaughter houses, poultry and meat processing combines, the fish and milk product industries. It is attractive to reclaim these proteins from the effluent waste water streams because they are very suitable to be used as animal food. Moreover, by removing protein from these effluent streams environmental pollution is reduced. The invention relates to a process in which the protein in waste water is removed to a very high extent by precipitation. According to the invention there is provided a process for the removal of protein from waste water, which comprises adding to the waste water a water soluble carboxymethyl cellulose, which in 1 by weight solution in water at 250C has a viscosity determined in a Brookfield viscometer from 25 to 900 centipoise, and removing the precipitate formed.Very suitably the protein is of animal origin, although the process according to the invention may also be used for removal of protein of vegetable origin from waste water. The pll during the process is of great importance, in that the amount of protein precipitated expressed as a percentage of the total amount present is very dependent on the pH. The pH at which the percentage of protein removed is optimal, can easily be determined in laboratory scale experiments for each type of protein containing waste water. In general a pH from 4 6 will be very suitable. Very good results are obtained with carboxymethyl celluloses which in 1 by weight solution in water at 250C have a viscosity determined in a Brookfield viscometer from 40 to 400 centipoise.The amount of carboxymethyl cellulose to be used in relation to the amount of protein present in the waste water may vary between wide limits, amounts of 5 15 w of carboxymethyl cellulose on total protein present are very suitable. In each case the optimum amount of carboxymethyl cellulose needed may very conveniently be determined in laboratory experiments. The precipitate form, which comprises protein and carboxymethyl cellulose, may be removed from the waste water by any suitable method, e.g., by filtration or centrifugation. The precipitate obtained is very suitable to be used as animal feed, because it does not contain any materials which form a bar to such use on toxicological grounds.EXAMPLE A 1 w v solution of blood protein was prepared by dissolving dried animal blood in water. Several carboxymethyl celluloses were added in aqueous solution to the blood protein solution, and for each of them the dosage at which maximum protein precipitation achieved occurred was determined at pH 5. The Table shows the maximum protein precipitation achieved with each carboxymethyl cellulose calculated on total protein present needed. Experiments 2 6 are according to the invention, Experiment 1 is a comparative experiment showing a low yield of precipitated protein when a carboxymethyl cellulose with low viscosity is used.
