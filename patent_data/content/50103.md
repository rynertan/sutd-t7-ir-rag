# An underwater missile for use against submerged submarines.

## Abstract
An underwater missile for use against submerged submarines has a missile housing with a magnetic contact surface 2 at a foremost end portion intended to contact a submerged submarine. The magnetic contact surface is provided by two magnets 2 , 2 located in adjacency and with reversed magnetic polarity. A magnetically operated switching means 5 is positioned adjacent to the magnetic leakage field of the magnets, and is arranged to be operated when the leakage field is increased by means of a metallic object located within the magnetic field of the magnets. The operation of the switching means first detonates a small propellant charge 6 to impose a force to cause complete adherence between the magnetic contact surface of the missile and the outer surface of a contacted submarine, and then denotes a main explosive charge 7 intended to penetrate the submarine.
