## Description
S PEG IF ICA T ION CONTAINER HAVING LOCKING rTECHANIS Technical Field The present invention relates to containers having a locking mechanism of the so called dial type, and more articularly to a container which can be unlocked when the user arranges numbers or symbols on a piurality of dials in a predetermined combination at a specified position and in which the combination of numbers or symbols for unlocking can be changed as desired, the container further being adapted to produce camouflaging noise and impact when a person other than the user attempts to unlock the container. Background Art Containers have heretofore been used widely which have a locking mechanism between the container body and its closure for preventing a person other than the user from opening the closure easily and which are useful as savings boxes and devices for accommodating personal seals, valuables, etc. or for containing chemicals harmful to infants and children. Kany locking mechanisms are proposed for this purpose as disclosed inJapanese Utility Model Publications Sho 49 26636 and Sho 54 17438, Japanese Utility Model Disclosure Sho 48 113989, etc. However, the proposals are all complex in construction and expensive to make, require a cumbersome procedure for the user to lock or unlock the container and are therefore unsatisfactory as locking mechanisms for such containers. For use with containers, locking mechanisms of the dial type are desirable by which the container can be unlocked only when numbers or symbols on a plurality of dials are arranged in a predetermined combination in a specified position, because these mechanisms can be handled relatively easily for locking and unlocking, assure reliable locking and are relatively inexpensive to manufacture. Containers having such a locking mechanism are known as disclosed in JapaneseUtility Yodel Publications Sho 53 15651 and Sho 551452 and Japanese Utility Model Disclosure Sho 47 28404. With the containers provided with a locking mechanism and disclosed in these specifications, however, the order of numbers or symbols to be arranged for unlocking is determined in the course of proauction and is not changeable after the container is delivered to the user, so that they have the drawback that the locking mechanism becomes no longer serviceable as such once a person other than the user becomes aware of the order of arrangement. Furthermore such containers must be manufactured with numbers or symbols arranged in many different orders for unlocking. This entails the drawback of increased manufacturing cost. In addition, the above container with a locking mechanism has the drawback that a frictional noise and a kind of impact produced when the dial is turned past the unlocking position readily tell persons other than the user the order of numbers or symbols to be arranged for unlocking. The container has another drawback in that the container is forcibly unlocked and separated into parts when subjected to a great force acting to release its closure from the container body. Accordingly an object of the present invention is to provide a container which is inexpensive to manufacture and free of the drawbacks of containers having such a conventional locking mechanism and which has a locking mechanism such that the combination of numbers or symbols for unlocking can be changed by the user as desired. Another object of the invention is to provide a container having a locking mechanism which produces a camouflaging noise and impact when a person other than the user turns a dial in an attempt to unlock the container. Still another object of the invention is to provide a container having a reliable locking mechanism such that the container will not be forcibly separated into parts even when subjected to a force acting to separate the container body from its closure. Disclosure of the Invention Specifically stated, the present invention provides a container which has a locking mechanism and which includes a container body and a closure having a tubular portion fitting to the mouth of the container body on the inside or outside thereof, one of the mouth and vhe tubular portion positioned inside being provided with radially outward projections arranged on its outer periphery axially thereof, the other member positioned outside being formed with a slit for causing the projections to project outward therethrough, a number of ring elements being provided in accordance with the number of the projections and fitting around the outside member as separated therefrom, the ring elements each having an inner edge in engagement with the projection and being partially formed with a groove for passing the projection therethrough, a stop ring being fitted to the forward end of the outside member by fitting means for preventing the ring elements from slipping off the outside member. In this container with a locking mechanism, the ring elements each comprise an inner ring and an outer ring which are fixed to each other by fixing means at one of a plurality of specified locations relative to each other circumferentially thereof, whereby the order of numbers or symbols to be arranged for unlocking can be changed by the user as desired. In the container having the improved locking mechanism described above according to the invention, the means for fixing the inner ring to the outer ring is provided by forming the inner ring in an equilateral polygonal external shape and forming on the inner eriphery of the outer ring a stepped fitting portion in a shape conforming to the shape of the inner ring.This makes it possible to produce a large quantity of outer rings, as well as of inner rings, in an identical shape to obtain containers with an inexpensive locking mechanism although the order of numbers or symbols to be arranged for unlocking can be changed as desired. Further in the container having the improved locking mechanism described above, the inner ring is formed in its upper surface with a plurality of recesses opened to the inner edge of the inner ring and arranged at a specified spacing circumferentially thereof, whereby the locking mechanism is adapted to produce a camouflaging noise and impact when a person other than the user turns the dial to unlock the container. This eliminates the likelihood that the person vrili readily become aware of the order of numbers or symbols to be arranged for unlocking. Such camouflaging noise and impact may be produced alternatively by radial projections arranged on the upper surface of the inner ring at a specified spacing, with or without a radially inward projecting piece formed on a lower inner peri heral portion of the outer ring. Further in the container of the invention having the improved locking mechanism described above, the means for fitting the stop ring to the outside member is provided by a radially outward protrusion formed on a forward end portion of the outside member and an Shaped groove formed in the inner periphery of the stop ring, or by a groove or fitting projection formed on the forward end inner periphery of the outside member circumferentially thereof and a fitting projection or groove formed in the inner periphery of the stop ring circumferentially thereof.This renders the strop ring properly fittable to the outside member, eliminating the likelihood that the closure will be released from the container body and forcibly unlocked when subjected to a great force which acts to separate the closure from the container body. Additionally when the inside member is tapered and has a diameter increasing toward its base end, the stop ring is fittable to the outside member with improved reliability.

Best Mode of Carrying Out the Invention The present invention will be described below in greater detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. Tig. 1 shows the appearance of a container having a locking mechanism of the invention, and Fig. 2 the appearance of the components thereof. As illustrated, the container of this invention comprises four kinds of comnoaents, i.e. a container body 1O, a closure 20, ring elements 30 and a stop ring 40. The container body 10 has a hollow cylindrical mouth 11 extending upward from the main portion thereof.The mouth 11 is formed on its outer periphery with radially outward projections 12 positioned at diametrically opposed locations and aligned verxically. As illustrated, four projections 12 are arranged vertically on one side. The projections 12 at the opposed location are at the same level. The corners of the projections 12 are rounded to facilitate the assembly of the container to be described later. On the other hand, the closure 20 comprises a flange 21 at the top and a tubular portion 22 extending downward therefrom. The tubular portion 22 has an inside diameter such that it is fittable around the container mouth 11. The tubular portion 22 is formed, at locations opposed to each other, with vertical slits 23 for allowing the projections 12 on the mouth 11 to be inserted therethrough when the closure 20 is fitted over the container body 10. The wall thickness of the tubular portion 22 and the height of the projections 12 are so determined that when the projections 12 are inserted through the slits 23 as above, the ends of the projections 12 will project radially outward beyond the outer peripheral surface of the tubular portion 22.A pair of radially outward protrusions 24 are formed om lower portions of the tubular portion 22 which are opposed to each other in a direction approximately at right angles to the direction in which the slits 23 are opposed. These protrusions 24 serve to engage the stop ring 40 to be described later. Indicated at 25 is a slot for placing coins therethrough. The ring elements 30 will now be described.The three ring elements 30 illustrated are all identical and each comprise a hollow cylindrical outer ring 31 and a plate like inner ring 32 having an equilateral octadecagonal contour and fitted to the inner periphery of the ring 31. The outer ring 31 is externally so chamfered as to have an equilateral octadecagonal cross section. The slides of the ring are successively marked with numbers 1 to 9, with each opposed sides bearing the same number. A stepped fitting portion 33 is provided on the inner periphery of the outer ring 31 at its upper portion to serve as means for fixing the inner ring 32 to the outer ring at specified locations along the circumference thereof where the rings are opposed to each other.Thus, when the inner ring 32 is fitted to the stepped portion 33, the lower face 34 of the stepped portion supports the inner ring 32 thereon, and the peripheral wall 35 of the stepped portion extends in the form of an equilateral octadecagonal shape in conformity with the contour of the inner ring 32 in intimate contact with the outer periphery of the inner ring 32. With the stepped portion so formed, the outer ring 31 and the inner ring 32 are held together against rotation relative to each other at the specified locations circumferentially thereof. The inner ring 32, which has the above mentioned equilateral octadecagonal contour, has a circular inner peripheral edge which is formed with grooves 36, 36 extending vertically therethrough and opposed to each other. The inside diameter of the inner ring 32 and the dimensions of the grooves 36 are so determined that when the ring element 30 as fitted to the tubular portion 32 of the closure 20 is fitted around the mouth 11 of the container body 10, the projections 12 on the container body 10 are inserted through the grooves 36 and the inner edge of the inner ring 32 is positioned inwardly of the outer edges of the projections 12 in engagement with the projections 12. Preferably the upper surface of the inner ring 32 is provided with recesses or projections for producing camouflaging noises and impact to prevent other persons from unlocking the container. This arrangement will be described later in detail. The stop ring 40 is attached to the lower end of the tubular portion 22 of the closure 20 for preventing the ring elements 30 from slipping off the outer periphery of the tubular portion 22. The stop ring has grooves 41 formed in its inner periphery at locations opposed to each other for permitting the projection 12 to pass therethrough and is further formed, in the inner periphery at suitable locations, with L shaped grooves 42 in which the protrusions 24 on lower portions of the tubular portion 22 are engaged. The L shapea groove 42 comprises an axial groove extending upward and a lateral groove extending from the lower end of the axial groove circumferentially of the ring and having a depth reducing toward its forward end. The end of the lateral groove is at an angle of about 900 with the groove 41.With the stop. ring 40 attached to the lower part of the tubular portion 22, the grooves 41 are in alignment with the slits 23 of the tubular portion 22.Indicated at 43 are a pair of positioning marks provided on the outer periphery of the stop ring 40 on the opposite side of the grooves 41. The container comprising the foregoing components are assembled by the following procedure. The three ring elements 30, each with the inner ring 32 fixedly fitted to the stepped portion 33 of the outer ring 1, are fitted around the tubular portion 22 of the closure 20. exit, the strop ring 40 is attached to the lower portion of the tubular portion 22 by inserting the protrusions 24 on the tubular portion 22 into the axial grooves in the L shaped grooves 42 and thereafterguiding the protrusions 24 into the circuiiiferential lateral grooves by turning the stop ring 40, with protrusion ends in bearing contact with the bottom face of the lateral grooves for engagement. In this state, the grooves 41 of the stop ring are in alignment with the slits 23 of the tubular portion 22 as mentioned above.The grooves 36 of the ring elements 30 are similarly aligned therewith. The projections 12 on the container body 10 are inserted through these slits 23, grooves 36 and grooves 41, whereby the closure 20 is fitted over the mouth 11 of the container body 10 as shown in Fig. 4 in section. Each ring element 30 is then randomly turned from this state to position. the inner.edge of the inner ring 32 inwardly of the outer edges of the corresponding projection 12 therebeneath as shown in Fig. 5 in section, with the result that the ring element 30 is restrained from moving upward by the ends of the projections 12.On the other hand, the ring elements 30 are fitted around the tubular portion 22 of the closure 20, and are retained on the tubular portion 22 b being prevented from slipping off by the strop ring 40, while the ring elements 30 are restrained from moving upward as described above. Consequently the closure is also prevented from removal and held locked. The container can be unlocked and separated into the components in a manner reverse to the above.After the separation, the order of numbers to be arranged for unlocking can be changed by the following procedure. According to the embodiment described above, the inner ring 32 and the outer ring 31 of each ring element 30 are fixed together so that the numbers 1 on the outer periphery of the outer ring 31 are in the same positions as the grooves 36 of the inner ring 32 circumferentially thereof as seen in Fig. 2. Accordingly, when the ring elements 30 are turned to set all the numbers 1 on the outer rings 31 to the locations of the positioning marks 43 on the stop ring 40, the grooves 36 of the inner rings 32 are turned to and arranged at the same positions as the projections 12 of the container body 10. Thus the closure 20 is in a so called unlocked state in which it is removable if pulled upward.Now when the arrangement of numbers for unlocking is to be changed, for example, to the order of 2, 4, 6 as arranged downward, the outer rings 31 nd the inner rings 32 are fixed together so that the rations of the outer rings 31 bering the numbers 2, 4, 6 individually as arranged cownwsrd will coincide v h the grooves 36 of the inner rings 32 circumferen tially thereof a shown in ie. 6.Since the inner ring 32 has an equilateral polygonal contour as already described and is fittable to the stepped Portion 33 formed on the inner periphery of the outer ring 31, the two rings can be fixed together at any desired location relative to each other circumferentially thereof. The number of the ring elements 30 to be installed on the container is not limited to three as mentioned, but a desired number of ring elements 30 are usable. Furthermore, the means for fixing the inner rng 32 to the outer ring 31 is not limited to the foregoing one but can be modified variously. A modification of the fixing means will now be described.Fig. 7 shows an inner ring 32 having a circular contour and cutouts 37 formed in its outer peripheral edge at a predetermined spacing, and an outer ring 31 formed on the inner periphery of its upper portion with a stepped portion 38 to which the outer periphery of the inner ring 32 is fittable and with projecting pieces 39 extending upward from the bottom face of the stepped portion 38. By the engagement of the projecting pieces 39 in the cutouts 37, the two rings 31 and 32 are fixed xo each other at a specified location relative to each other circumferentially thereof. The fixing means thus provided b the cutouts 37 and projecting pieces 39 is especially preferable in the case where the ring element 30 is marked with an increased number of numerals on its outer peripheral surface as illustrated, such that the inner ring 32, when having an equilateral polygonal contour with corners equal in number to that number, is nearly circular and unable to fully effectively engage the peripheral wall 35 of the stepped portion 33 of the outer ring 31.Although not shown, the two rings 31 and 32 may alterna.tively be adapted to be fixed together by a large number of indentations or projections formed on the lower surface of the inner ring 32 in a regular radial arrangement and projections or indentations engageable with those of the inner ring lower surface and formed in a stepped bottom face on the upper portion inner periphery of the outer ring 31. For the convenience of description, the foregoing embodiments have not been described with respect to camouflaging structures for concealing from persons other than the user the order of numbers or symbols arranged for unlocking. Such structures will be described below which are usable for any of the above embodiments and also for the other embodiments to be described later. A person other texan the user v ill come to know the unlocking arrangement of numbers or symbols usually J turning the ring element 30 while pressing the element upward to press the surface of the inner ring 32 against the lower face of the projection 12, detecting the position of the groove 36, i.e. the number or symbol corresponding to the groove 36, by the impact or noise produced when the groove 36 reaches the projection 12, and repeating this procedure for each of the ring elements. To prevent other persons from detecting the unlocking arrangement of numbers or symbols, a plurality of recesses 46 are formed in the upper surface of inner ring 32 according to the invention as seen inFigs. 8 and 9. ore specifically the inner ring 32 is formed in its upper surface with the recesses 46 having the same width as the grooves 36, opened to the inner periphery of the ring 32 and arranged at a specified spacing circumferentially thereof. When some other person turns the ring element 30 while pressing the surface of the inner ring 32 thus formed against the lower surface of the projection 12, the grooves 36 and the recesses 46 also produce exactly the same impact and frictional noise when passing the position of the projection 12, so that the person is unable to readily detect the nosition of the groove 36 and to unlock the container.For example, when the outer ring 31 has an equilateral tetracosagonal outer periphery as illustrated and is marked with the numbers 1 to 12 on the outer sides thereof, with the upper surface of the inner ring 32 formed with ten recesses 46 at an interval corresponding to two pitches of the numbers, a person may be able td detect the exact position of the groove 36 by the impact or frictional noise produced when the ring element 30 is turned with an upward pressure, but the probability is 1 out of 6 per ring element 30. In the case of a container having three ring elements 30, therefore, the probability that the person will unlock the container at the turned positions of the ring elements 30 detected by the impact or frictional noise is as small as 1 out of the third power of 6, i.e. out of 216. Thus the structure described is useful for camouflaging.Further when the outer ring 31 has an equilateral octatetracontagonal outer periphery and is marked with the numbers 1 to 24 on the outer sides thereof, with the upper surface of the inner ring 32 formed with twentytwo recesses 46 in the same manner as above, the nrobability of unlocking is 1 out of 1728 in the case where three ring elements 30 are used, or approximately 1 out of three millions in the case of six ring elements.The structure is therefore very effective for camouflaging. When the ring element 30 bears such z large number of numerals or symbol on its outer periphery, t e inner ring 32 may be fixed to the outer ring 31 preferably by projecting pieces 39 formed on the outer ring 31 and cutouts 37 formed in the inner ring 31.On the other hand, the inner ring 32 of the present embodiment shown in Fig. 9 has a relatively large thickness and a radially inward stepped portion along its periphery. The peripheral edge of the inner ring 32 is fitted to a stepped portion 33 of the outer ring 31 and to the inner periphery thereof under the stepped portion.The ring element 30 is convenient to handle since the rings will not separate easily inadvertently when the element is removed from the tubular portion 22 of the closure 20. Figs. 10 and 11 show a modified structure substantially similar to the above for producing camouflaging impact and frictional noises. As illustrated, an equlateral polygonal inner ring 32 is fitted in a fitting stepped portion 33 formed along an upper inner peripheral part of an outer ring 31.The upper surface of the inner ring 32 is substantially flush with the upper edge of the outer ring 31. The inner ring 32 is formed on its upper surface with radial projections 47 arranged circumferentially thereof at the same pitch as the numbers marked on the outer periphery of the outer ring 31. The outerxing 31 has radially inward projecting pieces 48 opposed to each other on the inner periphery of a lower portion thereof.The lower surfaces of the projecting pieces 48 are flush with the lower edge of the outer ring 31. With a container equipped with such ring elements 30 each comprising the outer ring 31 and inner ring 32, when one of the ring elements 30 is turned, the projections 47 on the inner ring 31 of that ring element 30 are intermittently brought into contact with the projecting pieces 48 of the outer ring 31 of the ring element 30 immediately thereabove, consequently producing impact and frictional noises to mislead a person who intends to detect the position of the groove 36. Radially inward projecting pieces may be formed on the lower edge of the flange 21 of the closure 20 for the projections 47 on the inner ring 32 of the uppermost ring element 30. Fig. 12 shows another embodiment of the invention including a modification of the means for fitting the stop ring 40 to the lower part of the tubular portion 22 of the closure 20. While the fitting means of Dbe embodiment already described comprises the protr ion 24 on a lower portion of the tubular portion 22 and the L shaped groove formed in the inner periphery o, the stop ring 40, the fitting means of the present embodiment comprises a fitting projection 26 formed on a lower part of the tubular portion 22 circumferentially thereof and a groove 51 formed in the inner periphery of the stop ring 40 circumferentially thereof. The stop ring 40 is attached to the lower part of the tubular portion 22 by fitting the projection 26 in the groove 51. To align the grooves 41 in the inner periphery of the stop ring 30 with the slits 23 of the tubular portion 22 at all times when the stop ring 30 is attached to the lower part of the tubular portion 22, a pair of positioning projections 27 is provided at the lower part of the tubular portion 22 in opposed relation to a pair of positioning indentations 52 formed in the inner periphery of the stop ring. Furthermore the mouth 11 of the container body 10 of the present embodiment is tapered to have a diameter increasing toward its lower end.Consequently, when the closure 20 is fitted over the mouth 11 of the container body 10, the lower part of the tubular portion 22 is forced radially outward to a slightly larger diameter by coming into contact with the base portion of the mouth 11 which has a relatively large diameter, with the result that the fitting projection 26 fits into the groove 51 properly, causing the tubular portion 22 to fit to the stop ring 40 with an increased force. Thus even when the container is subjected to a great force acting to separte the closure 20 from the container body 10, the tubular portion 22 will not release the stop ring 40 to eliminate the likelihood that the closure wiz be removed on unlocking.The groove 51 circumferentlally formed in the inner periphery of the stop ring 40 may be positioned above the midpoint of the overall height of the stop ring 40 as shown in Fig. 13. If it is then attempted to fit the stop ring 40 in an inverted position to the tubular portion 22 the lower each of the stop ring 40 Will intact the ring element 30 preventing the groove 51 fromxeaching the fitting projection 26 on the tubular portion 22 as seen inFig. 14. This eliminates the likelihood that the user will inadvertently attach the stop ring 40 in the inverted position to the tubular portion 22. Although unillustrated, the fitting means may alternatively be provided, for example, by externally and internally threading the lower part of the tubular projection 22 of the closure 20 and the stop ring 40, respectively, for joining the two members together by screw thread engagement. While positioning marks 43 are formed on the outer periphery of the stop ring 40 as shown in Pig. 12 for indicating the position where the unlocking arrange nt of numbers or symbols is to be located, such marks may be additionally provided on the peripheral edge of the flange 21 of the closure 20 as positioned in corresponding relation to the slits 23. Although various embodiments of the invention have been described above, the invention is not limited to these embodiments in which the mouth 11 of the container body 10 has projections and the tubular portion 22 of the closure 20 is formed with slits 23. As shown in Fig. 15, for example, a container body 110 has a mouth 111 formed with axial slits 123 as opposed to each other, while a closure 120 has a tubular portion 122 formed with a plurality of radially outward projections 112 on its outer periphery at each of opposed locations to fit the tubular portion 122 in the mouth 111. In this case, ring elements 130 shaped in theform of the ring elements 30 as inverted and described with reference to the foregoing embodiments are fitted around the mouth 111, with a stop ring 140 fitted to an upper portion of the mouth 111. The outer ring 31 need not always have an outer periphery marked with numbers or symbols. For example, the outer ring 31 may be shaped merely in a triangular or square external form, the sides of which are used for matching to unlock the container. The container bodies according to the invention are not limited to those already described. A hollow cylindrical mouth 11 may be attached in an upright position to a flat plate to use the interior of the mouth 11 as a containing space. The projections 12, grooves 36, etc., which are provided in pairs on opposite sides as described above, can alternatively be provided on only one side or on at least three sides. Figs. 16 and 17 show still another embodiment of the invention. The container body 10 thereof includes a main portion for containing articles. This portion is in the form of a box comprising two members 13, 14 which are fittable to each other in a vertical direction. A semicylindrical member extends sidewise from one side of each of these members to proviae a mouth 11. Projections 12 are arranged on the outer periphery of the mouth 11 as in the foregoing embodiments.The two semicylindrical members forming the mouth 11 are intimately fittable at their opposed edges when the two members 13, 14 are fitted together. The lower opening of the upper member 13 has an edge portion 15 which fit in the opening of the lower member 14 along the edge thereof. When an article is placed into the main portion of the container body 10, the two members 13, 14 are fitted together. An assembly of a closure 20, ring elements 30, stop ring 40, similar to those already described, is then fitted over the mouth 11, and the ring elements 30 are randomly turned, whereby the container is locked. Since the upper member 13 has the above mentioned edge portion 15 fitting in the lower member 14 along its edge, the upper and lower members 13, 14 are held to each other against horizontal displacement. This assures reliable locking without permitting opening of the two members 13, 14.The mouth 11, which is provided at only one location in the present embodiment, can be attached to each of two opposed side portions or to each of the four side portions. While the container body 10 of the present embodiment which is suitably shaped for use as a document case comprises two divided segments, it will be apparent that the container body 10 of any of the foregoing embodiments can be constructed similarly.
