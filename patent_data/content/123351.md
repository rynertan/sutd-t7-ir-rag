# A colour cathode ray tube having an in line electron gun structure.

## Abstract
The effective aperture sizes of the final focusing and accelerating electrodes of an in line electron gun structure for colour cathode ray tubes are increased by elongating the apertures, expanding the outer edges of the side apertures and surrounding the apertures with a peripheral raised rim which balances the asymmetry introduced into the aperture by enlargement. Partitions between the aperture may be radiused so their center height is lower than the height at the edges. The raised rim of the final accelerating electrode is generally higher than the raised rim of the focusing electrode.
