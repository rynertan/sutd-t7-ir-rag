# Polymer compositions and their use in or as adhesive and other compositions.

## Abstract
Polymer compositions, wherein the polymer contains at least one carboxylic acid group per polymer molecule, which contain a source of metal ions and also O methoxy aryl acid either as the acid or as the anion in a metal salt providing the metal ions have a marked viscosity dependence upon temperature. The source of metal ions must be miscible with the polymer and be present in an amount of at least 0.001 moles per mole of polymer. They are especially suitable for use in or as pressure sensitive hot melt adhesives, transmis sion fluids and other compositions where their viscosity temperature relationship is especially beneficial.
