# Process for the production of ultrahigh modulus polymers.

## Abstract
Process for the production of polyoxymethylene POM having small linear expansion coefficients and high tensile modulus, comprising the step of drawing the crystalline polymer continuously under dielectric heating while main taining the ambient temperature at an elevated level by external heating, said ambient temperature being controlled to change from a lower value to a higher value along the drawing direction of said crystalline polymer with a pre set temperature gradient.
