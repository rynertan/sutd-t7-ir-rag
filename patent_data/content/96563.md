# APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR ENCODING POSITIONS OF WEB PRESS MACHINES

## Abstract
An apparatus and method for encoding the lateral or circumferential setting within a web press of a laterally or circumferentially adjustable machine 46 for operating on a web is provided. The machine 46 has an element which moves linearly as the machine 46 is adjusted, and the apparatus 10 includes a linkage 18 connectable to the linearly moving element. An electric signal generator 22 is operatively connected to the linkage 18 for operation in response to movement of the linkage 18 . A reference point is defined for describing the setting of the machine 46 , and a code is computed in response to the signal generated by the signal generator 22 for designating the setting of the machine 46 with respect to the reference point. The generated code is then displayed in an appropriate manner or used to automatically set the machine 46 .
