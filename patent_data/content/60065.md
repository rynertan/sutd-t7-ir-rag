# Improved switch for portable electric tools.

## Abstract
A portable electric tool has a housing 15 , an electric motor 22 energized by a trigger operated switch 10 , and a receptable 18 recessed in the housing 15 . Terminals of the switch 10 are formed as plug prongs 13 which extend outwardly directly from the switch housing 12 into the receptable 18 for receiving the female connector 16 of a power supply cable 17 . Preferably, a second set of plug prongs 14 extend forwardly from the switch housing 12 and receive a female connector 19 of a motor cable 20 . This arrangement enables wiring connections to the switch for the supply cable to be eliminated.
