# Motor driven fluid control valve.

## Abstract
A rotary valve has a valve body 12 with a pair of fluid ports 16, 20 providing fluid exits on a face of the valve body. The fluid ports are connected to corresponding fluid channels 14, 18 in the valve body extending between the fluid ports and fluid connections 17, 21 to the valve body. A fluid control plate 8 is positioned in contact with the face of the valve body and extends across the fluid ports. The control plate has a fluid channel 9 therein which is dimensioned to extend between the build ports in one position of the valve plate. The valve plate is axially mounted on an output shaft 4 of a drive motor 2 which is connected to the valve plate by a coupling shaft 6 . The face of the valve body and the contacting face of the valve plates are ground precisely flat and after hard anodizing are coated with a low friction coating 40, 42 such as molydisulphide. The valve plate is urged against the face of the valve body by the weight of the motor and the connecting elements between the motor and the valve. The low friction coating allows a rotation of the valve plate on the valve body while providing a fluid seal therebetween to confine the fluid to the ports and channels.
