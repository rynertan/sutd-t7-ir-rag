# DEVELOPER COMPOSITIONS FOR PHOTORESISTS

## Abstract
An aqueous metal ion containing developer composition for developing photoresists comprising a metal ion free alkali and a metal ion free surfactant that is a quaternary ammonium compound. The developer permits a reduction of from 20 to 50 in the energy necessary to expose the photoresist without deleterious effect on image quality and image resolution.
