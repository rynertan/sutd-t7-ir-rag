## Description
Rotating Anode rpe X rag tube and method of generating an X rav beam This invention relates to a rotating anode type X ray tube with improved heat absorption capacity and to a method of generating an X ray beam. A common problem in rapid sequence radiographic studies, i.e., 33 MM Cine, rapid film and 105 tE spot filming, is that the intensity of the pulse radiation rapidly exhausts the anode and the X ray tube fails, even though portions of the anode surface have never been subjected to electron beam bombardment. This is also known as reaching the heat capacity of the anode.U.S. patents Nos. 3,836,805 Kok and 3,398,307 Brown et al. attempt to solve this problem by axially translating the anode relative to the cathode. To present different target surface portions to the electron beam this requires a complicated tube and anode support design.U.S. Patent No. 3,959,685 Konieczynski , contemplates an internal heat sink to attempt to increase the heat absorbing capacity of the anode, however, the increased heat capacity by this technique is greatly limited and is not uniform over the target surface. The present invention seeks to reduce or overcome the problem of distributing the electron beam generated heat over the entire anode surface and thereby improve the efficiency of an X ray tube by increasing theX ray tube anode heat capacity. In accordance with a first aspect of the invention there is provided an improved X ray tube of the t rpe having a target with a conical surface, means for rotatIng the target about an axis which is coaxial with the conical target surface, means for generating a beam of charged particles which impinge upon the target surface, and an evacuated housing enclosing the target, the target rotating means, and the beam generating means wherein the improvement comprises means adjacent the beam of charged particles for selectively deflecting the beam to predetermined hypothetical, circular tracks on the target surface whereby heating of the target surface can be distributed over the entire surface by selectively deflecting the beam at selected intervals from impingement upon a hotter portions of the target surface to a cooler portion, In accordance with a second aspect of the invention there is provided a method of generating anX ray beam comprising the steps of rotating a target surface within an evacuated enclosure about an axis, generating a beam of charged particles which impinge upon the target surface along one of a plurality of discrete, side by side, circular tracks about the target surface, and selectively deflecting the beam in a direction perpendicular to the direction of rotation of the target surface whereby the particular track about the target surface upon which the beam impinges can be selectively chosen. Preferably, the deflection takes place at right angles to the axis of rotation of the anode. Thus at the conclusion of each pulse exposure, the beam is electrostatically or magnetically deflected to a cold portion of the anode for the next pulse exposure. This procedure is repeated until either the heat capacity of the anode is reached or the X ray procedure is completed. Thus, maximum heating power is maintained for each exposure. This deflection can be done automatically, in prescribed increments or via a detection system, so that after one track has been utilized, the beam can be deflected to an alternate track and so forth until all tracks have been effectively used. At this point the beam returns to its initial position. Even if the beam eventually is returned to the initial track the heat generated by the initial exposure will have diffused into the anode body. In order that the invention may be better understood, two embodiments thereof will ow be described by way of example onl and with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a partially diagrammatic, sectional view, with portions broken away, of an X ray tube according to a first embodiment of the invention and Figure 2 is a partially diagramatic, sectioral view, with portions broken away, of an X ray tube according to a second embodiment of the invention. deferring now more particularly to Figure 1 a circular anode 10 is supported on a rotatable shaft 12 within an X ray tube envelope 14. The anode body has a conical surface 16 on which is placed an anode target surface 18. An electron beam generator 20 mounted within the tube envelope projects an electron beam 22 to impinge on the target surface 18. Thus far the description of the X ray tube has been conventional. In order to cause the electron beam to impinge upon the target surface 18 over a plurality of circular tracks which are parallel to each other and coaxial with the shaft 12, a pair of electrostatically charged plates 24 and 26 are placed on opposite sides of electron beam 22 and within the tube envelope 14. The plates 24 and 26 can be supplied with opposite charges by a power supply 28 mounted outside of the tube envelope 14 and connected to the plates 24 and 26 by suitable wiring 30 which passes through a seal on the tube envelope 14. The plates 24 and 26 can be positively and negatively charged, respectively, or negatively and positively charged, respectively or completely uncharged. The magnitude of the electrostatic potential difference between the plates 24 and 26 determines the angle of deflection of the electron beam 22 as indicated in dashed line fashion in the figure. It will also be noted that the deflection of the electron beam 22 is at right angles with respect to the axis of rotation of the shaft 12. That is the deflection takes place along lines which are parallel with the radius of the anode body 10. In operation, at the conclusion of each pulse of the electron beam, that is for each X ray exposure, the beam is deflected by means of the plates 24 and 26 to another portion of the target surface 18.It will be appreciated that this portion of the target surface on which the beam now impinges describes a circular track about the target surface 18 which is coaxial with the shaft 12. This new track is presumably cold and has not yet been impinged upon by the electron beam. This procedure is repeated for each X ray exposure. Once all of the tracks have been utilized the electron beam is deflected back to the initial track and so on until the heat capacity of the anode is reached.During the time that the tracks are not exposed to the electron beam the heat previously generated on those tracks defuses into the anode body so that the surface of the anode is thereby cooled. The sequence of the beam deflections can be automatically programmed to occur after each exposure or it can be controlled by a scanning optical pyrometer which senses the heat level of the anode track in use. Although in the above described embodiment the electron beam generator 20 is aligned to project an electron beam parallel to the axis of rotation of the shaft 12, in other embodiments the electron beam generator 20 can be positioned perpendicularly to the rotational axis of the shaft 12. This assumes that the target face 18 of the anode body 10 forms a 450 angle with the rotational axis of the shaft 12. In the embodiment depicted in Figure 1 the X ray beam produced at the target surface 18 exits from the tube envelope 14 in 2 direction generally perpendicular to the rotational axis of the shaft 12 whereas in the embodiment depicted inFigure 2 the direction taken by the exiting X rays is generally parallel to the axis of rotation of the shaft 12. While in both of the described embodiments the X ray beam deflecting means are depicted as comprising a pair of charged plates, in other embodiments, magnetic coils can be substituted for the plates to deflect the beam in a manner knosm per se to accomplish the same purpose, that is to deflect the electron beam in a direction parallel to the radius of the anode so that the beam can be selectively caused to impinge on a plurality of discrete circular tracks about the anode target. There has been described a rotating anodeX ray tube system in which the electron beam is its source so as to spread the beam path more evenly over the surface of the anode. Mle face of the rotating anode of the X ray tube is provided with a series of discrete hypothelical tracks of circular configuration, to which the beam path can be directed to spread out the heat thereby generated over the entire anode.
