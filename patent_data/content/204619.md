# Subsea master valve for use in well testing.

## Abstract
In accordance with illustrative embodiments of the present invention, a new and improved subsea test tree includes a hydraulically operable control unit and shut in valve unit that are releasably latched together. The control unit includes an integral retainer valve system at the upper end thereof. The main shut in valve, which is a ball valve, is a fail close device under the influence of a spring and nitrogen pressure. Additional assistance in close the valve may be provided if needed by hydraulic pressure applied to a surface control line. Internal pressure may be vented prior to unlatching the control unit in case of an emergency.
