# METHOD OF MANUFACTURING A PYROELECTRIC UNIT.

## Abstract
A method of manufacturing a pyroelectric unit which includes the steps of imparting a temperature change to pyroelectrically coupling particles dispersed between a pair of opposed electrodes 13, 14 applied by an electric field before the particles adhere to the electrode 13 when manufacturing a laminate of particles for a polycrystalline pyroelectric unit or composite pyroelectric unit, thereby forming a layer of pyroelectrically coupling particles on the electdrode 13 so that the orientation of the pyroelectric axes is aligned in advance. This temperature change could be done by the steps of cooling the vicinity of the electrode 13 by evaporation from the surface of the dispersion liquid 12 , thus lowering the temperature of the liquid as the particles approach the electrode 13 . Thus, dipoles are induced on the particles, and the orientation of the polarity of the pyroelec tric axes can be performed by the electric field between the electrode pair before the particles adhere to the electrode 13 .
