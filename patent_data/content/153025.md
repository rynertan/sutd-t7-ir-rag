# Microprogram control.

## Abstract
A data processing apparatus is described, which includes a microprogram control unit for producing control signals for the apparatus. Each microinstruction MI contains a number of control bits, and an address field. The address field addresses a control memory 23 so as to read out a control word CW . Each control word specifies the way in which the control sig nals are mapped on to the control bits of the microinstruction. The output of the control memory 23 controls switching logic 24 which connects the control bits to the specified control signal lines. This variable mapping of the control signals allows the control signals to be packed into any available space in the microinstruction, thus reducing the required number of bits in the microinstruction without any significant loss of flexibility. Certain critical control signals AFN, VFN however are derived from fixed positions in the microinstruction so as to avoid de lays. These critical control signals are confirmed by validity sig nals AVAL, VVAL from the control memory 23 .
