# Plate heat exchanger.

## Abstract
1. Plate heat exchanger in the form of several heat ex changer plates 1 placed close to and sealed against each other and having pressed out ridges 4 to form the heating surface of the relative plate in order to provide two different flow passages in the same plate heat exchanger. The plate heat exchanger according to the invention consists of identic ally like heat exchanger plates 1 , the packing groove 9 of which has its bottom placed in the central plane of the plate 1 . The heating surface of the relative plate is further divided into at least two area portions 5 8 , the ridges 4 in one area portion 5 having an angle α₁ relative to the symmetry axes X and Y, respectively of the plate lying in its plane, which is different from the angle β₁ formed by the ridges 4 in the other area portion 6 with the symmetry axes and that one or more of the other plates included in the heat exchanger are turned 180 about one of said symmetry axes X, Y starting from the orientation of one plate in the plate heat exchanger.
