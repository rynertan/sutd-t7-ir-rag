# Method of producing a water in oil emulsion explosive.

## Abstract
A water in oil emulsion explosive, comprising aqueous inorganic oxidizer solution, oil, emulsifier and hollow micros pheres, and having high low temperature detonability and storage stability can be produced without causing breakage of the hollow microspheres through a specifically limited knead ing method, wherein agitating blades fitted to an agitating shaft in a kneader are subjected to up and down movements in the axial directions of the agitating shaft and concurrently to a rotary motion to knead homogeneously a water in oil emuision formed of the aqueous solution of inorganic oxidizer, oil and emulsifier, together with the hollow micro spheres.
