# Resin composition.

## Abstract
A resin composition comprising A a modified polyphenylene oxide prepared by graft polymerization of an acrylonitrile compound or a monomer mixture containing acrylonitrile compound and a styrene compound in the presence of polyphenylene oxide and B a polymer having units of an acrylonitrile compound and being compatible with the modified polyphenylene oxide A . The composition has excellent heat resistance, mechanical property, impact resistance, solvent resistance, antioxidation property and transparency.
