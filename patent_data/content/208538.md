# Optical pickup with astigmatic focusing.

## Abstract
An optical pickup for astigmatic focusing on an optical disk. A planar beam splitter 7 reflects light from a source 1 through an objective lens 3 to the recording track 4 of the disk. The light reflected from the disk is transmitted through the beam splitter 7 . The beam splitter is inclined to the opti cal axis so that astigmatism is produced on transmission. A cylindrical lens 5 is placed along the path of the transmitted light and is oriented so that the combined astigmatism is aligned across a quadruple element detector 6 .
