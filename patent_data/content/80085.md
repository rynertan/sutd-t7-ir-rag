# Producing methyl ethers from branched monoolefins.

## Abstract
Methanol is reacted with branched monoolefins such as isobutylene, or mixtures of hydrocarbons such as mixed C 4 s from or in a refinery, in the presence of methanesulfonic acid. A column 10 operation is described wherein meth anesulfonic acid 11 and methanol 12 are fed in counter current fashion to hydrocarbons 13 . Crude product ether is removed as a liquid sidestream 25 above the feed of methanesulfonic acid 11 , while hydrocarbons depleted of the reactive branched monoolefins 24 are removed over head. The methanesulfonic acid suppresses the vapor pressure of methanol relative to product ether.
