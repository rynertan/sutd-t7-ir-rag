# A metallised composite structure and a process of preparing same.

## Abstract
The composite structure, which has a reflectivity of at least 85 , a heat emission of about 8 of the Stefan Boltzmann constant at 23 C, a mirror reflectivity as defined of at least 4 and dead fold properties the same as the subs trate, is prepared by coating a smooth polymeric film 1 with a lacquer 2 which gives a releasable bond to the film and has a contact angle of zero degrees to the film, vapour depositing a metal layer 3 on the lacquer to produce a non releasable bond, applying a laminating adhesive 6 to the metal layer 3 and bonding by means of the laminating adhesive 6 to a non metallic substrate 7 and stripping the polymer film 1 from the lacquer layer 2 .
