# ZINC ELECTROLYTE TREATMENT

## Abstract
A neutral leach filtrate containing an oxidant selected from permanganate and manganate ions and mixtures thereof is treated with a reducing agent selected from ZnSO₃, SO₂ or mixtures thereof in amounts sufficient to substantially reduce all the manganese ions present permanganate and or manganate to the divalent state and to provide a zinc sulfate solution having a predetermined pH. Such a solution consumes appreciably less zinc in the known zinc dust purification or cementation step prior to zinc recovery by electrodeposition or like process.
