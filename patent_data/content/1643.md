# Aminoglycoside derivatives, process for their manufacture, pharmaceutical compositions and carboxylic acids.

## Abstract
Aminoglycoside derivatives of the general formula I CHEM wherein R is an optionally substituted 4 to 6 membered heterocyclic group containing 1 or 2 nitrogen atoms R 1 is aminomethyl, hydroxymethyl, 1 aminoethyl, or 1 methylaminoethyl R 2 , R 3 and R 6 are each hydrogen or hydroxy pi 2 , R 3 and R 6 are each hydrogen or hydroxy R 4 is hydroxy or amino R 5 is amino or methylamino R 7 is hydroxy or methyl R 8 is hydrogen, hydroxymethyl, or carbamoyloxymethyl and the dotted line represents the optional presence of a double bond and their salts with acids, a process for their manufacture, pharmaceutical compositions having antibiotic activity and containing compounds of the general formula I furthermore carboxylic acids of the general formula III R COOH wherein R has the above meaning, useful as intermediates for preparing the compounds of the general formula I .
