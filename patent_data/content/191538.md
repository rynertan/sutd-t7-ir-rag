A chip resistor which comprises a flat ceramic support, a NiCrAl resistance layer and solderable metal currentsupply strips, characterized in that the NiCrAl resistance layer present on one face of the support is provided at two opposite sides with contact strips of nickel or a nickel alloy with Ni as main constituent and, possibly, an intermidiate layer of aluminium, an aluminium alloy or chromium, and that an insulating protective layer extends over the resistance layer and partly overlaps the contact strips, and that solderable metal strips which extend along the sides to the bottom of the support are provided on the exposed portions of the contact strips.

## Description
The invention relates to a chip resistor and to a method for the manufacture thereof. In order to obtain chip resistors having a small tolerance and a low temperature coefficient of resistance in the entire range from 10 Ohm to 100 kOhm, the restistance layers of such resistors can best be produced by means of the thin film technique. The said technique utilizes vacuum deposition or sputtering. British Patent Specification GB PS 991,649 discloses such a resistor which comprises a support to which at least one resistance layer is applied and which resistor comprises at least two flat solderable metal currentsupply strips, each strip consisting of at least two metal layers each, at least the bottom layer of which is vapour deposited. However, the known structure has so far proved inadequate to produce a resistance layer for a chipresistor having a low temperature coefficient of resistance in the entire range from 10 Ohm to 100 kOhm. The stability of the resistors also leaves a lot to be desired. Undoubtedly the material choice is an important factor herein. It is the object of the invention to provide a chip resistor which has a low temperature coefficient of resistance in the range from 10 Ohm to 100 kOhm and a high stability, which is capable of withstanding life tests and which exhibits a low level of noise. The chip resistor in accordance with the invention, which comprises a flat ceramic support, a NiCrAl resistance layer present on one face of the support is provided at two opposite ends with contact strips of nickel or a nickel alloy with Ni as main constituent and, possibly, an intermediate layer of aluminium, an aluminium alloy or chromium, and that an insulating protective layer extends over the resistance layer and partly overlaps the contact strips, and that solderable metal strips which extend along the sides to the bottom of the support are provided on the exposed portions of the contact strips. This construction is based on the insight that the actual resistance layer is not in direct contact with the solderable contact strips. The resistance layer is only in metallic contact with the ends of the layers of nickel, a nickel alloy and possible an intermediate layer of Al, an Al alloy or chromium, which materials do not exhibit, surprisingly, a diffusion in the resistance layer of NiCrAl. In the manufacture of the chip resistor, after application of the Ni alloy and the projective layer, the resistance layer is not exposed to attack by material of the other process steps. The nickel alloy of the contact strips at the two opposite sides of the resistance layer, preferably, comprises a NiV alloy or a NiCr alloy containing 7 of V and 10 of Cr, respectively. These alloys are non magnetic as is desired for magnetron sputtering which is the preferred method of application. In order to manufacture a chip resistor in accordance with the invention, first a NiCrAl layer is applied to one side of the flat ceramic support, which layer is then coated with a layer of nickel or a nickel alloy with Ni as main constituent, possible preceded by a layer of Al, an Al alloy or chromium by means of photo etching, first the two contact strips and then a pattern in the resistance layer are manufactured, after which an insulating protective lacquer is applied to the resistance layer and partly overlaps the contact strips, next, metal current supply strips extending along the sides to the bottom of the support are provided on the exposed portions of the contact strips, and finally, a soldering metal layer is applied to the last mentioned contact strips. The resistance layer and the contact strips located at two opposing sides of said resistance layer are preferable applied, as stated above, by means of magnetron sputtering. The metal current supply strips are first coated with a layer of a metal, preferably nickel, by means of sputtering, preferably magnetron sputtering, after which the said layer is electrically or electrolessly strengthened using nickel. If required, a layer of a lead tin alloy is superposed by means of electrodeposition. It is also possible to directly sensitize the metal strips, for example, by means of a solution of stannous chloride and palladium chloride followed by electroless nickel plating of the said strips. In the manufacture of the chip resistor, the two opposing contact strips on the resistance layer may well be used to measure the resistance during trimming of the resistance value by means of a laser beam. In accordance with a further embodiment of the invention, one or more resistors can be integrated according to the new configuration into a hybrid circuit or a resistive network. In order to explain the invention, the production process will now be described in more detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which By means of magnetron sputtering, a layer of NiCrAl having a thickness of 500 Åand comprising 30.5 by weight of Ni, 57 by weight of Cr and 12.5 by weight of Al, is applied to a substrate of Al₂O₃measuring 96 x 114 mm subsequently a 0.5µm thick layer of NiV comprising 7 by weight of V is applied to the said substrate and finally a coating of a commercially available positive photo resist, for example AZ 1350 J from Shipley, is superposed. For the manufacture of lowohmic resistors, preferably, a double layer is applied which comprises a layer of aluminium, an aluminium alloy or chromium and a layer of NiV, the total thickness of the layers being 1µ. After the substrate has been exposed through a mask and the non exposed lacquer has been dissolved, the contact strips are formed by etching away the exposed layer of NiV in concentrated HNO3 containing 5 of HCL. This reagent does not attack the NiCrAl layer. A second similar lithographic operation is carried out, for example, to provide a meander pattern to the NiCrAl so as to obtain a predetermined resistance value. The NiCrAl is etched in an aqueous solution somprising 220 g of cerium ammonium nitrate Ce NH₄ ₂ NO₃ ₆ and 100 ml of 65 HNO₃, per litre. The NiCrAl layer is then aged by heating at 300 350 C for 3 hours. By means of a laser beam, the resistors are trimmed to the required value one by one, the resistance value being measured between the contact strips. Next, a protective layer is applied, for example Probimer 52 marketed by Ciba Geigy or Imagecure marketed by Coates, which layer covers the NiCrAl coating of each resistor and overlaps the contact strips over approximately 50µm. The plates are then scribed between the individual resistors by means of a CO₂ laser, Subsequently, the strips are parted to form individual chip resistors which are coated in al electroplating drum with in succession 2µm of Ni and 6µm of PbSn or Sn. Such a chip resistor in accordance with the invention, measuring for example 3 x 1, 5 x 0,63 mm³ is depicted in Figure 1 of the accompanying drawing. A substrate 1 carries a NiCrAl layer 2 contact strips 3 , a protective layer 4 , side contacts 5 and, finally, a lead tin layer 6 . With the chip resistors in accordance with the invention, resistors having a very low temperture coefficient after ageing, can be obtained for example, between 10 and 0x10 ⁶ C at 300 Ohm and 25x10 ⁶ C at 10 Ohm. In the case of resistors between 300 Ohm and 100 kOhm, the noise is approximately 1 2x10 ²µV V and for resistors between 300 and 10 Ohm, the noise may increase to approximately 10 ¹µV V. The stability of the resistors is determined by subjecting them to a life test for 1000 hours at 70 C under a load of 1 8 W. The maximum tolerance is 0.2 for resistors of 1 kOhm, 0.1 for resistors of 100 kOhm and 0.3 for resistors of 10 Ohm. Figure 2 shows a part of a hybrid circuit in which reference numeral 9 represents printed conductors, 7 a low ohmic NiCrAl resistor and 8 a high ohmic resistor. In addition to the resistors already present, still further components not shown , such as capacitors, potentiometers, transistors and circuit elements on a semiconductor substrate are to be included in this circuit. In Figure 3 Figure 3a is a cross setional view, in which 1 is the substrate, 2 is a uniform NiCrAl layer which is applied by sputtering and 3 is an Ni layer which is applied by electrodeposition, to which layer a layer 4 of a photosensitive lacquer is applied. After exposure and development, the nickel is selectively etched away in accordance with the desired conductor pattern, such that the pattern as shown in Figure 3 Another photo resist layer is applied and the desired resistors are selectively removed from lyer 2 using an etching agent. After removal of the remaining photo resist the pattern in accordance with Figure 3 Figure 4 shows how a clamp conection 14 is secured to the end of the conductor by means of a layer of solden 13.
