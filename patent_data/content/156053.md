# Pipe moulds.

## Abstract
A pipe mold 10 for centrifugally casting pipe is dis closed. The pipe mold according to the present invention is made by depositing weld material 14 on a rigid shell 12 . The rigid shell is obtained by forming a flat plate into a cylin der and welding the resultant seam 16 . Additional rigid shells can be circumferentially welded together to obtain a desired length. The welded seams are areas of weakness called metallurgical notches. To eliminate the metallurgical notches, weld material is deposited on the shell. In one embodiment, weld material is deposited on the outside of the shell. The shell then is machined away. The resultant pipe mold has a total wall thickness comprising weld material and is free of metallurgical notches. In addition, the need for fur nace heat treatment to achieve properties in the weld material can be eliminated.
