# Mounting a semiconductor device in a microwave cavity oscillator.

## Abstract
A microwave cavity oscillator has a semiconductor device, for example a transistor 50 for exciting the cavity 12 to oscillate. The device is mounted upon a substrate which is itself mounted, conveniently soldered, upon a car rier 32 which is releasably secured in a chamber 14 adja cent the cavity. The carrier 32 and substrate 42 are mounted so that the device 50 is coupled to the cavity via a hole 22 extending therebetween and can be removed and installed as a sub assembly to facilitate tuning and other adjustments in a test bed. In preferred embodiments one end of the carrier is located in spigot and socket fashion in a recess 24 surrounding a hole communicating with the cav ity. The other end of the carrier is urged by spring means 44 to positively and accurately locate the carrier relative to the cavity. A part 46 of the substrate extends through the hole and into the cavity. The transistor 50 is mounted on the part within the hole and the part within the cavity serves as a capacitive coupling probe 48 .
