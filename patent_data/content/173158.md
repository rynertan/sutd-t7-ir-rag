# LIQUID CRYSTAL DISPLAY DEVICE

## Abstract
Between a liquid crystal module 3 and a control circuit 7 for controlling said liquid crystal module, there are provided a counter circuit 10 dividing the frequency of a timing signal M given by said control circuit 7 and an exclusive OR circuit 11 whose inputs are square wave pulses M delivered from said counter circuit and square wave pulses M given by said control circuit 7 with a period of twice the frame period. The polarity of voltages applied to liquid crystal module is reversed by square wave pulses M delivered from the exclu sive OR circuit with frequency higher than the frame fre quency.
