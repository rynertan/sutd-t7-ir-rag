## Description
CYLINDER LAWNMOWERSIn the design of cylinder or reel type lawnmowers it is important to maintain the integrity between the fixed bottom blade and revolving cutters. A common practice is to ensure that the chassis of the machine is torsionally rigid to minimise the adverse effects of operational loads on this integrity.This invention relates to a bottom blade and rotating cylinder geometry that eliminates the need for a torsionally rigid chassis. The position of the bottom blade relative to the cylinder is normally adjustable to take account of manufacturing tolerances and wear in use. This is generally achieved by pivoting the bottom blade at one point for movement toward and away from the cylinder, and providing adjusting screws to alter the degree of on cut . In this invention the bottom blade is pivoted substantially about the axis of the cylinder.With this geometry any forces generated due to an impact between the cutting mechanism and a solid object are resolved about a common point and no adverse moments are set up that would normally cause unequal displacement between the bottom blade and the cylinder along its length. Additionally, the chassis may twist without significantly affecting the degree of on cut.To effect adjustment of the degree of on cut, a rotatable eccentric device is preferably incorporated into the pivot point. By rotating the eccentric the clearance between the bottom blade and the cylinder can be adjusted. Further restraint is generally required to prevent the bottom blade moving, and this is preferably achieved by a spring mechanism. This may be a linear spring fixed to the body of the machine or a torsional spring fixed close to the pivot. The same spring may be used to provide resilience such that, if the bottom blade and cylinder strike a solid object, the bottom blade is slowly displaced to absorb the impact. By use of the same eccentric as above, or an additional eccentric, a clearance between the bottom blade and cylinder may be established as the bottom blade moves back under impact.This has the advantage of allowing the offending object through the cutting system without causing damage.One example of a vegetation cutting system embodying the present invention is illustrated in the accompanying drawings in whichFig 1 is a front view of a cutting module with its associated drive mechanismFig 2 is a sectional view at the left hand end of the system shown in Fig 1Fig 3 is a sectional view at the right hand end of the system shown in Fig 1, andFig 4 is a perspective view of the bottom blade in the cutting system of Figs 1 to 3. .. The drawings illustrate a cutting .systen for a cylinder lawnmower, and only details of theXlAwnnower necessary for an understanding of the cutting system have been illustrated. As viewed in the drawings, a left hand drive housing 10 is secured to the body of the mower and supports a motor not shown driving a pinion 11. The drive from pinion 11 is transmitted to a pulley 12 by a belt 13. The housing 10 is a metal housing, such as a zinc die casting, but the mower body not shown is a lightweight structure which may be formed primarily of plastics materials.The pulley 12 includes a hub 14 rotatably mounted in a bush 15 retained in a bearing housing 16 secured to, or forming an integral part of, the drive housing 10.The opposite face of the bush 15 receives a reduced diameter portion 17 of a drive shaft 18 carrying a cutting cylinder 19. This mounting arrangement for the drive shaft 18 is more fully described, and separately claimed, in our UK Patent 2137062B.An annular ring 20 fits over the reduced diameter portion 17 of shaft 18 to shield the bush 15, the ring 20 being bounded by a shoulder 21 of the bearing housing 16. The small clearance between shoulder 21 and the ring 20 prevents grass clogging the bush 15.Mounted on the outside of the bearing housing 16 is an eccentric component 22 which permits adjustment of the clearance between the bottom blade and the cutting cylinder. The component 22 has an outer portion 22a concentric with the axis of cylinder 19 and an inner eccentric hub 22b for pivotally mounting a bottom blade 29. A sector 23 of the concentric portion 22a is provided with teeth 24 which mesh with an on cut adjusting screw 26. The eccentric hub 22b of component 22 receives a circular opening 27 Fig. 4 formed in a mounting bracket 28 welded or otherwise secured to the left hand end of bottom blade 29. The bottom blade 29 has a cutting edge 30 which cooperates with the blades of the rotating cylinder 19 to produce a shear cutting action in a conventional manner.As best shown in Fig 2, the eccentricity of the component 22 is such that the bottom blade 29 is pivoted about an axis 31 disposed behind the axis 32 of the cutting cylinder. In this particular example, the distance between the axis 31 and the axis 32 is about 4 mm. The position of the axis 31 can be adjusted from the position shown in the drawing by rotating the adjusting screw 26 until the axis lies about top dead centre as viewed in Fig 2.This range of adjustment displaces the cutting edge 30 of the bottom blade relative to the rotating cylinder by an amount equal to the eccentricity and is used to compensate for wear of the blades. When correctly adjusted in the on cut position, the clearance between the bottom blade and the cutting cylinder should be extremely small, for example O,I mm. To cushion the impact with a solid obstacle, the bottom blade 29 is able to swing about the axis 31 against the bias of a preloaded compression spring 33 which urges a tab 34 projecting from the bracket 28 against an end stop 35 secured to the housing 10.The preloading of spring 33 is selected to retain the blade 29 in its on cut position during normal mowing, the spring being further compressed only when the blade hits a solid obstacle. Spring 33 is retained within a housing 36 also secured to the main housing 10.At the right hand end of the cutting cylinder, the drive shaft 18 rotates in a bronze bush 40 retained in a bearing housing 41, the bush and the housing being retained on the end of the shaft by a washer 43 and a screw 49 which engages a threaded bore in the reduced diameter end portion 51 of the shaft 18. The bush 40 is protected from grass and other debris by an annular shield ring 42.The arrangement at this right hand side for mounting the bottom blade 29 is similar to that described for the left hand side of the cylinder but the stiffness of the bottom blade makes it unnecessary to retain the blade against an end stop at both sides. The desired stiffness of the blade 29 is achieved by forming a strip of sheet metal into a closed loop section 53 with a projecting lip 60 incorporating the cutting edge 30, the underlying edge 54 being welded to the overlying portion of the strip to provide the closed loop section. One advantage of this blade structure is that the required torsional rigidity or stiffness is achieved while keeping the inertia of the blade to a minimum. This further reduces the risk of damage should the blade strike a solid obstacle. To provide additional support for the lip 60, the underlying portion of the strip can be extended beneath the lip so that the edge 54 lies immediately behind the cutting edge 30. In this case a seam weld is provided across the full width of the lip. The right hand end of the blade 29 is secured to a bracket 44 having an aperture 57 for receiving an eccentric hub 45a of a component 45 mounted on the bearing housing 41. The component 45 also includes a concentric portion 45b with a toothed sector 46 Fig 3 meshing with an on cut adjustment screw 47.Accordingly the above described adjustment system uses a single eccentric component at each end of the cylinder, the set position of the bottom blade relative to the cutting cylinder being adjusted by rotating the respective adjusting screws 26, 47. In this example, only a nominal clearance less than 0.5 mm opens between the cylinder and the bottom blade during swing back against the bias of spring 33, the range of swing back being 30 degrees. By using an additional eccentric, greater clearances can be achieved.A particular advantage of the described arrangement is that cutting loads are not carried through the mower body, but pass directly from the bottom blade to the cylinder via the eccentric component 22 and the drive housing 10. Accordingly, the mower body can be made of lightweight plastics material.Moreover any twisting of the bodywork about the cylinder axis will have little effect on the cutting performance, since twisting of the bodywork is equivalent to rotation of the right hand eccentric component 45 together with the RH bearing housing 41 with respect to the fixed back stop 35 for the bottom blade 29. Accordingly, twisting of the bodywork produces exactly the same effect as rotating the RH eccentric when adjusting the on cut setting. Since the bottom blade 29 is pivoted substantially about the axis of the cutting cylinder 19, any forces generated as a result of an impact with a solid obstacle are resolved about a common point and no adverse moments are set up that would normally cause unequal displacement between the bottom blades and the cylinder along its length.In one alternative embodiment not illustrated , the bottom blade 29 is detachably secured to the mounting bracket 28. This has the advantage that the bottom blade is then easily removable by shifting it to the right until bracket 44 slips off the eccentric component 45 at the RH end of the cutting cylinder. A replacement blade or an alternative accessory could then be fitted, or the mower could be converted to a scarifier as described, for example, in our UK Patent 2116412B.In another embodiment also not illustrated the eccentric component 45 is engaged with the bottom blade mounting bracket 44 so that they rotate together rather than being rotatable relative to one another. Twisting of the mower bodywork would then produce rotation of the bearing housing 41 but no accompanying rotation of the eccentric component 45.Such an arrangement therefore ensures that the position of the bottom blade relative to the cutting cylinder is unaffected by twisting of the bodywork.
