# Aerosol container disposal unit.

## Abstract
Containers and the like pressurised containers for inflammable gases or toxic chemicals, in which the containers are punctured or otherwise destroyed, by for example a shredder 30 fed from a sealed hopper, and separated from fluid initially contained therein, in an enclosure 42 through which a stream of air passes to an exhaust outlet 40, 51 but which is otherwise sealed against the egress of gases at normal operating temperatures and pressures. The stream of air passing through the enclosure 42 is made sufficient to dilute the gases released following destruction of the containers, to a level below the flash point of the gas air mixture.
