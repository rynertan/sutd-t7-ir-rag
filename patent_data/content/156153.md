# Yarn quality monitoring system.

## Abstract
A yarn spinning machine has a large number of spinning stations and two independently operable monitoring sys tems. One such system is responsive to the operating condi tions of the stations spin no spin and can distinguish individual stations at a central data register 12, 14 . The other is responsive to the quality of yarn produced at each station, but cannot distinguish individual stations at the central regis ter. The yarn quality monitor can induce a yarn break at a station producing poor yarn. The monitoring systems are linked via a CPU, a quality defect register 20 and a yarn break register 12 to allocate quality induced breaks to individual operating stations.
