# Process for preparing alkyl glyceryl ether alcohols.

## Abstract
Novel alkyl glyceryl ether alcohols, suitable as intermedi ates for the preparation of biodegradable surfactants, are prepared by reacting a stoichiometric excess of C₁₀ C₂₀ linear alkyl alcohol with glycidol predissolved in hexylacetate.
