# High temperature solid electrolyte electrochemical cells.

## Abstract
High temperature, solid electrolyte eletrochemical cell 12 has first 29 and second electrodes with solid electrolyte 30 between them, where the electrolyte is formed by hot chemical vapor deposition, where a solid, interlayer material 28 , which is electrically conductive, oxygen permeable, and protective of electrode material from hot metal halide vapor attack, is placed between the first electrode and the electrolyte, to protect the first electrode from the hot metal halide vapors during vapor deposi tion.
