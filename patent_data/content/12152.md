# Method for the production of high pore volume alumina powders.

## Abstract
A method for the production of alumina powder having high pore volume, comprising drying an alumina slurry by a heating said slurry to a temperature above 190 F b a pressure of up to the critical point of water then, c introducing said slurry to a drying chamber through an orifice sufficiently small to create a back pressure in excess of slurry vapor pressure, and up to the critical point of water.
