## Abstract
A method of fabricating a field effect transistor comprising the steps of forming an active layer 3 of semiconductor material, eg GaAs over the surface of a first substrate 1 of semiconductor material, eg also GaAs, forming source, drain 6,7 and gate 10 electrodes over the surface of the active layer, applying a second substrate 11 of insulating material to the surface of this structure and removing the first substrate. To facilitate the removal of the GaAs first substrate by selective etching, a buffer layer 2 of GaA1As resistant to the GaAs etchant may be formed between the first substrate and active layer, which buffer layer is removed, following removal of the first substrate, using a selective etchant to which the GaAs active layer is resistant. A second gate electrode may be formed on the active layer following removal of the first substrate. The technique is particularly applicable to high frequency FET devices.
