## Description
INFORMATION RECORDING MEDIUM FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to an information recording medium which writes and or reads information by laser light, particularly, a light information recording medium using a transparent glass base plate. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Conventionally, recording mediums using high energy beams such as laser light and the like have been used. In these thermal recording mediums, the recording layer has a high optical density and absorbs the irradiated light beam having a high energy density to cause a partial increase in temperature. As a result, the information is recorded by changing the optical characteristics of the light irradiated part by physical or chemical changes. These types of recording mediums have various advantages. For example, a high density recording is possible, the writing and reading of information is possible at a high speed, the access time is short, the long term preservability of information is excellent and the like. In general, such a thermal recording medium is frequently recorded by converting information to be recorded into electric time series signals and scanning the recording medium with a laser beam the intensity of which is modulated according to the signals. This method is desirable because recorded images are obtained in real time. These recording layers heat mode recording layer generally include a metal, semimetal or semiconductor such as Bi, Sn, In, Te and the like as a thin layer provided on a glass or transparent plastic base plate by vacuum evaporation or the like as described in U.S. Patents 4,188,214, 4,291,119, 4,069,487, 4,000,334 and 3,665,483. The occurrence of a scratch or the adhesion of foreign material such as dust and the like on the surface of the recording layer, during the operation or preservation of theserocording mediums, often affords bad effects on the information which can be recorded or read. In order to eliminate such disadvantages, a sandwich type whole surface adhesion type or air sandwich type information recording medium is used, as described in Canadian Patent 1,029,130 and U.S. Patent 4,074,282. As the base plate, plastics such as polymethyl methacrylate and the like are generally used from the viewpoint of workability, handling, cost and the like.However, these base plates are easy to scratch and have problems in their dimensional stability and surface property.Accordingly, the glass base plate is more preferably used than plastic base plates. However, glass base plates are brittle, the sensitivity of the recording layer is low as the heat conductivity of the plate is high and the adhesive property with the recording layer is inferior. In order to eliminate these disadvantages, various polymers are used as an undercoating layer for example, JapanesePatent Application OPI Open to Public Inspection Nos.138066 82, 77325 76, 46019 78, 157136 80, 142094 81 and the like . The formation of such an undercoating layer could improve the adhesive property of the base plate with the recording layer and the sensitivity of the recording layer to some extent. However, the effect of the materials proposed so far is not yet satisfactory. Also, the formation of an undercoating layer composed of a chlorinated polyolefin and a particular aminoalkyl alkoxysilane compound has been proposed in U.S.Patent 4,317,123. The undercoating layer composed of such a composition is effective when using plastics as the base plate, but the adhesive property of the base plate with the recording layer and the like were still insufficient when using glass as the base plate. Therefore, it is desired to develop an undercoating layer which further improves the adhesive property with the recording layer when using glass as the base plate and which also can improve the sensitivity of the recording layer and its preservability. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present inventors found that the above disadvantages can be eliminated by providing an undercoating layer comprising a layer of a silane coupling agent and a layer of other organic materials on it on the glass base plate. A primary object of this invention is to provide an information recording medium, which can write and or read information by laser light on a transparent glass base plate, the medium comprising a glass base plate having thereon in sequence, a silane coupling agent layer, a layer of organic polymer material and a recording layer. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The base plate used in this invention is a disk type transparent glass. Examples of glass include silicate glass e.g., silicate glass, quartz glass, aluminosilicate glass, invert glass, etc. ,borate glass, phosphate glass, germanate glass, tellurite glass, vanadate glass and alumate glass. The thickness of the base plate is suitably about 1.0 to 1.5 mm. Various compounds are used as the silane coupling agent in this invention, and commercial compounds can also be used. Examples of preferred silane coupling agents include vinyl trichlorosilane, vinyl trimethoxysilane, vinyl triethoxysilane vinyl tris 8 methoxyethoxy silane, y glycidoxypropyl trimethoxysilane, y methacryloyloxypropyl trimethoxysilane, N B aminoethyl y aminopropyl methoxysilane, N B aminoethyl y aminopropylmethyl dimethoxysilane, y chloropropyl trimethoxysilane, rmercaptopropyl trimethoxysilane, y aminopropyl triethoxysilane, vinyl triacetoxysilane, r methacryloxypropyl tris B methoxyethoxy silane, B 3,4 epoxycyclohexyl ethyl trimethoxysilane, gamma mercaptopropyl trimethoxysilane, vinyl tris t butylperoxy silane, CH3O 3 SiC3H6NHC2H4NHCH2CH CH2 HCQ, CH30 3Si H6NHC2H4NHCH2 COOH, CH3O SiC3H6NHCH2CH CH2, CH3O 3SiC3H6NHCH2CH CH2HC2, CH3O 3SiC3H6NHCH2H4NHCH2CH CH2, CH3O 3SiC3H6EMI5.1 CH3O 3SiC3H6NHEMI5.2 and the like, but this invention can not be limited by these compounds.Among these coupling agents, particularly, the epoxy type silane coupling agents having at least one epoxy group such as y glycidoxypropyl trimethoxysilane, B 3, 4 epoxycyclohexyl ethyl trimethoxysilane and the like and the aminosilane type coupling agents having at least one amino group such as N B aminoethyl gamma aminopropyl trimethoxysilane, N ss aminoethyl gamma aminopropyl dimethoxysilane, y aminopropyl triethoxysilane and the like are preferably used. These silane coupling agents, in that condition if they are commercial liquids and after dissolving or dispersing in a proper solvent if they are solid, are coated on the transparent glass base plate by a proper method such as spin coat, dip coat, extrusion coat and bar coat, preferably spin coat and dip coat, and then dried. Examples of solvent include acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, diacetone alcohol, methyl cellosolve, ethyl cellosolve, butyl cellosplve, methyl cellosolve acetate, ethyl cellosolve acetate, butyl cellosolve acetate, hexane, cyclohexane, ethylene chloride, methylene chloride, benzene, chlorobenzene, methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropyl alcohol, butanol, petroleum ethers, dimethylformamide, a thinner, and the like.The film thickness of the silane coupling accent layer is crefer ably 0.01 to 5 pm, particularly 0.1 to 2 pm. According to this invention, a layer of other organic materials is.further provided on the layer of silane coupling agent. Preferred materials include polymers such as polyvinyl chloride, polyester, polyimide, vinyl acetatevinyl chloride copolymer, ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer, acetyl cellulose, polyethylene, polyvinylidene chloride, polyethylene fluoride, polyethylene chloride trifluoride, polyvinylidene fluoride, polycarbonate, polypropylene, polybutene, nylon, polystyrene, polystyrene vinyl toluene copolymer, polyvinyl formal, polyvinyl alcohol, polyacryl resin, polyacryl resin copolymer, polymethacryl resin, polymethacryl resin copolymer, polyethylene chlorosulfonate and the like. Molecular weight of these materials varies depending on the kind of polymers and it is generally 100 to 300,000, preferably 500 to 100,000. Of these, polyvinyl chloride, polyimide, vinyl acetate vinyl chloride copolymer, ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer, polyvinylidene chloride, polystyrene and styrene vinyl toluene copolymer are preferably used. The polymer layer can be formed in the same manner as the layer of above mentioned silane coupling agent.The thickness of the layer is similary to the above, and is preferred to be O.01 to 5 pm, particularly 0.1 to 2 pm. The polymer layer may have a multi layer structure generally up to 4 layer structure , each sub layer of which may have different functions e.g., further improving the adhesive property with the recording layer or the glass base plate, preventing diffusion of alkalis from the glass base plate, etc. . The recording layer is formed on the polymer layer.The materials used to make the recording layer are not especially restricted, and the materials used in this technical field, for example, metals such as Te, Zn, In, Sn, Zr, Al,Cu, Ga and the like semimetals such as Bi, As, Sb and the like semiconductors such as Ge, Si and the like and their alloys or combinations are used. Also, the sulfates, oxides or fluorides of the metals, semimetals, semiconductors and the like can be used to make recording layer. These recording layers are described in, for example, U.S. Patents 4,188,214, 4,291,119, 4,237,468, 4,415,650, 4,271,256 and 4,388,400.In particularly, the vacuum evaporated product of these compounds with metals such as Ge, Sn, In and the like are excellent. For the recording layer, vacuum evaporation, spattering, ion plating and the like are used and the thickness of the recording layer is suitably 300 to 1,500 as the optical density required for laser information recording. This invention can apply not only to the mono plate type information recording medium but also to the sandwich type and air sandwich type recording mediums.In the latter case, booh recording elements are bonded together through a spacer while facing the recording layers inside, but in this case, the above mentioned undercoating layer can be formed on the spacer so that the joint of the spacer with the recording elements is made stronger. As described above, the recording layer is formed on the transparent glass base plate through the layer of silane coupling agent and the polymer layer. This causes the adhesion of the glass base plate with the recording layer to be improved due to the presence of the silane coupling agent. The adhesive property of the recording layer is further improved by properly selecting a polymer layer to be formed on the silane coupling layer. Moreover, characteristics of the recording layer such as sensitivity, memory preservativity, S N and the like can be improved.The above results are summarized in Table 1. Evaluation method Laser output required for recording mW The pulse exposure recording was performed from the side of the base plate using an argon ion laser beam wavelength 5145 having a maximum output level of ZW.The beam was converged to a beam diameter of 2.5 Wm by a lense. The pulse exposure time was 100 nsec. The minimum laser output strength by which the memory trace was formed on each sample was measured. Namely, the smaller the output, the higher the sensitivity. Adhesive force On the recording layer were made rifts by drawing parallel lines at intervals of 1 mm vertically and horizontally drawn on the recording layer in a depth sufficient to reach the glass base plate by a steel knife, to make 100 measures having the area of 1 mm x 1 mm. After sticking a mylar tape polyethylene terephthalate pressure sensitive adhesive tape No. 313, manufactured by Nitto ElectricIndustrial Co., Ltd. on the above recording layer, the adhesive force was evaluated by determining the number of 1 mm x 1 mm measures which remained when the mylar tape was strongly stripped off in the upper direction of 900. The larger the number of strips of memory layer remaining, the. better the adhesive force. Memory preservativity evaluated at 600C, 90 RH A ... The surface is good. B The surface becomes a little blurred. C ... The surface becomes blurred to a great extent.
