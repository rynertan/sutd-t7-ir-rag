# A method for increasing color density and improving color fastness of dyed fabrics.

## Abstract
The invention provides a method for increasing the color density of dyed fabric material of, especially, synthetic fiber as well as the fastness of the color by rubbing and washing, in particular, when the dyed fabric material is finished with var ious kinds of fabric finishing agents. The inventive method comprises exposing the dyed fabric material either before or after the finishing treatment to low temperature plasma of an inorganic gas under a reduced pressure. The inorganic gas is preferably oxygen or a gaseous mixture containing at least 10 by volume of oxygen. The color deepening effect is par ticularly remarkable when the color of the dyed fabric material is black to impart increased graveness and vividness of the color.
