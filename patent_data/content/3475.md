# Manufacture of uniform glass mats by the wet laid process, a glass fiber dispersion used in this process and coated glass fibers.

## Abstract
In accordance with the present invention, there is provided herein improved glass fiber dispersions for making uniform glass fiber mats by the wet laid process. The well dispersed glass fiber compositions of this invention usually are prepared by mixing chopped glass fibers in water with a small amount of a select group of cationic quaternary ammonium compounds which have at least two long chain groups as part of the molecule. As features of the invention, the dispersions may be formed at relatively high glass fiber consistencies, in neutral or slightly alkaline solutions, and without generation of a high degree of foams. The resultant dispersions then are used to make very high quality glass fiber mats at high rates of production.
