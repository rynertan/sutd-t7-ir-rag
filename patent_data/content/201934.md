Verfahren zur Herstellung eines 2 Carboxypyrazin 4 oxids mit der Formel I

## Description
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of 2 carboxypyrazine 4 oxides having the formula I wherein R₁, R₂ and R₃, which may be the same or different, represent a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Thus, the substituents R₁, R₂ and R₃ may be a straight chain or branched methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl and hexyl groups, respectively. More precisely, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of the aforesaid 2 carboxypyrazine 4 oxides I , by catalytic oxidation by means of H₂O₂, of the corresponding 2 carboxypyrazines having formula II 2 carboxypyrazine 4 oxides I , wherein at least one of the R₁, R₂ and R₃ groups is an alkyl radical, are pharmaceutical products having hypoglycaemic and hypolipaemic activity. It is known that the N oxidation of heterocyclic bases, including the diazinic derivatives, is generally carried out by using, as oxidizing agents, organic per acids, produced separately or prepared in situ, starting from H₂O₂ and the corresponding acids, for instance acetic acid, formic acid and maleic acid. It is also known that the N oxidation of 2 carboxypyrazines by means of the aforesaid oxidizing agents in some cases cannot occur, whereas in other cases it does not give good yields and or it is not regioselective. In the case of non substituted 2 carboxypyrazine, i.e. compound I wherein R₁, R₂ and R₃ are hydrogen atoms, it is impossible to obtain any N oxide by means of organic per acids. In the case of substituted 2 carboxypyrazines for instance 2 carboxy 5 methylpyrazine , using either per formic or per acetic acid, the corresponding 4 oxide is obtained in admixture with 1 oxide and 1,4 dioxide, thus giving rise to difficult and expensive separation problems, whereas by using per maleic acid, and by working at 0 C, the 4 oxide can be obtained, but only with unsatisfactory yields and after a particularly long reaction time of about 2 days. Therefore the direct oxidation of 2 carboxypyrazines to 2 carboxypyrazine 4 oxides by means of organic per acids can not be industrially exploited. On the contrary, the 2 carboxypyrazine 4 oxides having formula I can be obtained in a selective way starting from the corresponding 2 carboxypyrazine having the formula II by a several stage process, that involves the conversion of the 2 carboxypyrazine II into the corresponding amide III through the intermediate formation of a mixed anhydride, according to the reaction scheme indicated hereinafter. Following this comes the regioselective N oxidation of the amide III to the 4 oxide IV by means of per acetic acid, and the subsequent conversion of the 4 oxide IV into the desired compound I by saponification such as by means of NaOH. This polystage process is long, toilsome and burdensome from an economic point of view. Furthermore the N oxidation stage requires a large excess of organic acid to form in situ the per acid, which must be present at least in stoichiometric amount in comparison with the substratum to be oxidized. Finally the separation of the organic acid at the end of the reaction requires peculiar or delicate operations. It is an object of the present invention to provide a simple and economic process in order to obtain, in only one stage, 2 carboxypyrazine 4 oxides having formula I by catalytic oxidation, by means of H₂O₂, of 2 carboxypyrazines having formula II . It is another object of the invention to provide a process which allows one to obtain 2 carboxypyrazine 4 oxides I with a good yield and in a selective way. It is another object of the invention to avoid using organic per acids, thereby avoiding the drawbacks connected with the use of great quantities of organic acids which are precursors of the per acids and consequently without the need for separation of such acids at the end of the reaction. These and still other objects are attained by the process, according to the present invention, for the preparation of 2 carboxypyrazine 4 oxides having formula I by oxidation of the corresponding 2 carboxypyrazines having formula II . This process is characterized in that 2 carboxypyrazines II are reacted under stirring with an aqueous solution of H₂O₂ at a pH ranging between 0.5 and 5, in the presence of a catalyst selected from the group consisting of tungstic acid, a homopolytungstic acid, a heteropolytungstic acid, molybdic acid, a homopolymolybdic acid, a heteropolymolybdic acid, and an alkali metal salt thereof. In fact we have found, according to the present invention, that whereas the direct N oxidation of 2 carboxypyrazines II by means of organic per acids does not occur in some cases and gives low yields and or is not selective with respect to the desired 4 oxide in other cases, the same reaction occurs with formation of the 4 oxide with good yields and in a selective way, when use is made of a catalyst of the present invention. The reaction is generally carried out at temperatures ranging between 0 and 100 C. Preferably one works between about 60 C and about 90 C. Usually one works at substantially atmospheric pressure. As the starting 2 carboxypyrazines II , one prefers to employ those wherein one of the R₁, R₂ or R₃ substituent groups is an alkyl group having from one to six carbon atoms, whereas the two remaining substituents are hydrogen atoms. The methyl group is the preferred alkyl group. 2 carboxy 5 methylpyrazine is one of the most preferred starting compounds. As explained hereinbefore, the catalyst is selected from the group consisting of tungstic acid, a homopolytungstic acid, a heteropolytungstic acid, molybdic acid, a homopolymolybdic acid, a heteropolymolybdic acid, and the alkali metal salts in particular the sodium and potassium salts of these acids. Among the heteropolytungstic acids, use may be made for instance of phosphotungstic acid, arsenotungstic acid,and borotungstic acid. Among the heteropolymolybdic acids, use may be made for instance of phosphomolybdic acid and aresenomolybdic acid. The tungsten compounds are preferred as they are endowed with a higher catalytic activity. Tungstic acid and its alkali metal salts are chiefly preferred. The catalyst can be formed in situ in the reaction medium as well, by introducing into the reactor, together with H₂O₂, water, and optionally 2 carboxypyrazine I , a tungsten or molybdenum compound, capable of turning into the tungstate or the molybdate ion in the reaction medium, and by then bringing the pH to a value ranging between 0.5 to 5. Tungsten and molybdenum compounds, suitable for converting into the tungstate or the molybdate ion in the reaction medium, are for instance WO₂, W₂O₅, WO₃, WS₂, WS₃, WCl₆, WOCl₄ W CO ₆, Mo₂O₃, Mo₂O₅, and MoO₃. As explained hereinbefore, the reaction is carried out at a pH ranging between 0.5 and 5. Preferably one works at a pH between about 1.0 and 2.0. The catalyst is generally used in amounts ranging between 0.01 and 1 mole of W or Mo per mole of substratum, and preferably between 0.01 and 0.05 moles of W or Mo per mole of substratum. 2 carboxypyrazine II and H₂O₂ may be used in a 1 1 molar ratio, corresponding to the reaction stoichiometry. Preferably, use is made of a slight excess of H₂O₂ for instance 10 30 compared with the stoichiometric amount. The starting concentration of H₂O₂ in the aqueous solution of H₂O₂ generally ranges between 1 and 20 by weight, and preferably between about 5 and about 10 . The reaction is carried out, for instance, as follows an aqueous solution is prepared containing H₂O₂ and the selected catalyst and this solution is brought to the desired pH by means of dilute mineral acids or bases for instance HCl, H₂SO₄ or NaOH . The substratum is added to the aqueous solution and the whole is treated, under fairly strong stirring, which suitably forms an aqueous suspension of the substratum, at the desired temperature until completion of the reaction is reached. The desired product, sometimes, may already start to precipitate by the end of the reaction, and when the reaction is over, it could precipitates, at least for the most part. The invention is still further illustrated by the following examples. 330 mg 1 mmole of Na₂WO₄.2H₂O were dissolved in 16 ml of H₂O in a 50 ml flask, equipped with mechanical stirrer, reflux cooler, and thermometer. 3.75 ml of H₂O₂ at 40 weight volume 400 g 1 44 mmoles were added to the solution and the pH of same was brought to 1.5 by means of dilute H₂SO₄. Then 5.52 g 40 mmoles of 2 carboxy 5 methylpyrazine were introduced. The resulting aqueous suspension was heated under stirring to 70 C for 2 1 2 hours thereby obtaining a gradual solubilization of the suspension. Near the end, a partial precipitation of the reaction product from the solution was noted. At the end, the mixture was left to settle at room temperature overnight, thereby obtaining a substantial precipitation of the product in the crystalline form. The product was filtered, washed with a little icy water, and dried on a porous plate. 4.68 g of 2 carboxy 5 methylpyrazine 4 oxide were obtained, partly in the hydrated form 2.83 of water , equal to 4.54 g of anhydrous product. The yield was 73 . 250 mg 0.75 mmoles of Na₂WO₄.2H₂O were dissolved in 13 ml of H₂O in a 50 ml flask, equipped with mechanical stirrer, reflux cooler, and thermometer. 3.23 ml of H₂O₂ at 40 weight volume 38 mmoles were added to the solution and the pH of same was brought to 2.0 by means of dilute H₂SO₄. Then 3.76 g of 2 carboxypyrazine at 98 30 mmoles were introduced. The resulting aqueous suspension was heated under stirring to 80 C for 2 hours, thereby obtaining a complete solubilization of the suspension after 45 minutes. At the end, the solution was left to settle overnight at room temperature, thereby obtaining the precipitation of the reaction product in the crystalline form. The product was filtered, washed with a little icy water, and dried on a porous plate. 3.02 g of 2 carboxypyrazine 4 oxide monohydrate were obtained found H₂O 11.35 calculated water for the monohydrate product 11.39 . The yield was 63 .
