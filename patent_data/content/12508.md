# Process for the cleaning of fouled heat exchangers and other process equipment.

## Abstract
Heat exchangers and other equipment whose surfaces have become fouled with sludge deposits during the use of the equipment in the removal of carbon monoxide, lower olefins or other complexible ligands from gas streams, employing a liquid sorbent which comprises a cuprous aluminium tetrahalide and an aromatic hydrocarbon sol vent, are cleaned by contacting the fouled surfaces of the equipment with an aqueous ammonium chloride solution to dissolve and or lossen substantially all of the deposited sludge, washing the surfaces with water to remove loosened sludge and residual cleaning solution, and drying them.
