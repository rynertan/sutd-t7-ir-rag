## Description
Energy saving switching device. This invention relates to an energy saving switching device. It is known that a corsiderable amount of electrical energy is wasted owing to electrical apparatus, and in particular lamps, remaining switched on even if there is no need for them. In offices and the like, for example, light continues to burn in fully deserted spaces because the person who was the last to leave the place did not switch off the lamps. It also occurs that lamps are lit early in the morning, and that people forget to turn off the lamps when sufficient light enters through the windows. It is clear that a considerable saving in energy can be realized by consistently switching off unnecessarily switched on lamps or other electrical apparatus in a space. It is an object of the present invention to provide an energy saving switching device which automatically switches off unnecessarily switched on lamps or other apparatus. For this purpose, according to the invention, a switching device of the kind described is characterized by a microphone which in the presence of sound supplies an output signal to an electronic circuit which, after being switched on by means of an on key provided for the purpose, and in the presence of an output signal from the microphone energizes a relay by means of at least one terminal of which one or more consumers can be connected to the mains voltage. It is noted that switching devices per se have been designed for a specific purpose, such as switching off the pump of a central heating installation, or switching off a refrigerator. These known switching devices, however, are only suitable for use together with a specific electrical apparatus. The switching device according to the present invention is particularly suitable for switching off the lighting in unused spaces, and is in addition designed to be built in in conventional standard assembly boxes. The switching device according to the invention permits being connected to both individual consumers and groups of consumers. In a simple embodiment, which is suitable for spaces which cannot receive day light, the switching device according to the invention is arranged so that, in response to sound caused by human beings and after the nor. key has been depressed, the lamps connected to the switching device are switched on. For spaces capable of receiving day light, the switching device may be arranged so that the switching device does not become operative unless in the absence of sufficient day light and in the presence of sound caused by human beings and after the on key has been depressed. Some embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 shows a basic diagram of a switching device according to the invention responsive to bQth light and sound and Figure 2 shows an elevational view of a practical embodiment of a switching device according to the invention. The switching device shown in Figure 1 comprises a microphone 1, which at choice may be placed either together with the remainder of the switching device in one housing or elsewhere. The microphone 1 is connected via an amplifier 3 provided with a voltage divider 2 for setting its sensitivity, to a frequency filter 4 having such characteristics as to pass only frequencies associated with sounds to which the switching device should respond. In a practical embodiment the filter may have a pass band, for example, of 200 4000 Hz. The output signal from filter 4 is supplied via a flip flop 5 to a holding circuit 6 with a holding period of, for example, 4 minutes, adjustable by means of an adjusting device 7. This means that, if no acoustic signal is received for more than four minutes after receiving an acoustic signal, the output signal from the holding circuit drops to zero. The output of the holding circuit is connected to one input of a flip flop 8. Flip flop 8 can only give off an output signal in response to a signal provided by the holding circuit if first an on key 9, shown diagrammatically, has been depressed. In the embodidiment shown in the figure, the on key also serves as an off key. This combined on off key is connected to a flip flop 20, which serves as an anti contact bouncing circuit 20. The whole unit, i.e. the on off key 9 plus the anti contact bouncing circuit 20 is referred to hereinafter as the combined on off key 9 20. The output of flip flop 8 causes, via a control circuit 10, the energization of a relay 11, one or more contacts 12 of which can connect one or more consumers V to the mains voltage N. In order that the position of the switching device and its proper operation may be checked, there may be provided a for example green LED L1 which, if necessary via an amplifier 13, is connected to the output of flip flop 8. LED L1 only burns if the combined on off key 9 20 has been depressed and sound is present, and accordingly indicates that the switching device is in operation. Furthermore, in the embodiment shown, a red LED L2 is provided, which via an amplifier 14 is connected to the output of the holding circuit 6 to indicate that sound has been detec.ed. The circuit arrangement as described hereinbefore is only responsive to sound. As stated before, the switching device may be also be designed to respond to sound only if there is insufficient day light. For this purpose, Figure 1 shows a light sensitive element, for example, an LDR 15, which is connected to a voltage divider 16 for setting a threshold level, and connected to an AND gate 18 having an inverting input 17. The other input 19 of the AND gate is connected to the output of flip flop 8, so that the AND gate only gives off an output signal if there is sound in the absence of sufficient light. The output of theAND gate is in turn connected to the circuit 10. When the light has been switched on LDR is then out of operation the unit only responds to sound Reset . If desired, the LDR may be placed at a remote point Outside . The microphone, too,may be placed at a remote point, should this be desired. Connected to flip flop 8 is the combined on off key 9 20 which, when the switching device is stand by or has been switched on, is used for switching off the switching device. Figure 2 shows an elevational view of an example of a device shown in Figure 1, placed in a standard assembly box. Disposed behind the window of the combined on off key designated by 9 20 is the LED designated by L1, the microphone designated by 1, and the light sensitive element, designated by 15. These elements are placed in a cover plate except for the red LED indicated by L2, which is disposed under the cover plate of standard dimensions, and mounted on a standard assembly box in the usual way, with the other parts of the circuit arrangement being housed in the subjacent assembly box and, if necessary, in standard assembly boxes connected to this. It is observed that, in order to provide a universal system, similar cover plates may be formed without a light sensitive element, or only with a microphone, or only with a light sensitive element. It is further observed that various modifications of the embodiment described will readily occured to those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the present invention.
