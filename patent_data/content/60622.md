# Catalyst.

## Abstract
A metal oxide catalyst composition is in the form of particles having at least one face formed by solidifi cation of melt in contact with a surface and preferably having at least one channelled surface whereby the pres sure drop through a bed of such particles is limited. The particles are made preferably by casting a melt thinly and fracturing and resulting layer. Such a composition comprising iron oxide is a precursor of an ammonia syn thesis catalyst.
