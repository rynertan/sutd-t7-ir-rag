# ELECTRIC RESISTANCE HEATING ASSEMBLY FOR PLASTICS MATERIAL EXTRUDERS

## Abstract
The assembly comprises coiled resistances 3 passing through one or more holes as transversely formed in ceramics material strips 1 so shaped as to be effective to be coupled to one another in a partial sliding relationship and to provide a structure having void spaces, enpageable by the electric re sistance 3 and being restrained, on the outside thereof, by a net band 5 wound as a ring and provided with means for re movable coupling its end portions.
