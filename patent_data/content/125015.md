# Control line protector for oil well tubing string.

## Abstract
A control line protector for securing and protecting a control line or lines 38 to the exterior of an oil well tubing string. The protector comprises a flexible steel strap 22 to one end of which a trunnion 25 is attached. A second strap member 28 is removably mounted at 26, 30 to the other end of the strap 22 and carried a second trunnion 32 . The trunn ions 25, 32 are interconnected by two screws 34 which may be rotated to draw the trunnions towards one another, thus tensioning the straps 22, 28 around a length of tubing 14 forming part of a drill string. An axially directed channel 36 is formed adjacent one of the trunnions to receive the control line 38 .
