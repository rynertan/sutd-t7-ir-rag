# Improvements relating to heat exchangers.

## Abstract
A heat exchanger comprises a matrix of packed con struction having fins 12 and tubes 13 arranged in alter nate layers, bounded by, side casings 17, 18 . Feed tubes 16 which pass through the matrix at either end are pro vided with abutments 19, 21 adjacent to the side casings after assembly to retain the matrix in an assembled state to enable handling without a jig prior to brazing.

## Description
Improvement Relating to Heat Exchangers This invention relates to heat exchangers and in particular to heat exchangers of the packed construction typed Generally in such heat exchangers corrugated fins are sandwiched between flat section tubes to define airways between the tubes. hitherto such heat exchangers have commonly been assembled in a combined assembly arid brazing i, and have included a pair of side casings arid a pair of end casings which enclose the packed construction matrix. Under some circumstances it has been preferred to render the heat exchangers self jigging so that whilst assembly may still take place in a jig the heat exchanger can be removed from the assembly jig without risk of disintegration and then brazed in a fixture. This self jigging feature has generally been achieved by applying a compression load to the assembled heat exchanger and connecting the side and end casings together so as to avoid subsequent expansion of the assembly when the compression load is removed. According to the present invention a method of producing a heat exchanger matrix assembly for subsequent brazing includes the step of retaining a pack of fins and tubes in an assembled state by a feed tube that passes through apertures in the tubes and has an abutment at each side of the matrix to prevent disassembly thereof. he feed tube may be inserted through said apertures after the matrix has been assernbled, or altern tively the matrix may be assembled onto the feed tube, placing each of the tubes in turn over one end of the feed tube as the matrix is built up prior to the provision cf that feed tube end lah its abutment. Gerc i ily two eed tubes are provided , one at each end of thc hoct exchanger, thc cby renderIng further securing means unnecessary prior to brazing. Preferably the method includes the step of expanding an end portion of tile feed tube after assembly of the heat exchanger matrix. The feed tube end portion may for example be expanded by swagiLlg or by bell lug the tube end. Preferably the method includes the step of locating a pair of side casings one on each side of the matrix and secured thereto prior to brazing by the feed tube which passes through apertures in the side casings. Although under many circumstances the method according to the invention will enable the end casings of the prior art to be omitted for simplicity, cheapness and light weight, it is of course possible to include the step of providing a pair of end casings for greater rigidity or particular mounting requirements. The invention extends to a heat exchanger matrix assembly for subsequent brazing, including a pack of fins and tubes which are retained in an assembled state by a feed tube that passes through apertures in the tubes and that has an abutment at each side of the matrix to prevent disassembly thereof. Figure 1 shows a heat exchanger matrix assemb v of packed construction prior to brazing andFigure 2 is a cross sectional side view of the heat exchanger of Figure 1 taken along the line II II. In Figure 1 there is shown a matrix asoc r ly foril51 aluminiun oil cooler 11 for a motor vehicle Tile oil cooler is of packed construction and has a matrix comprising a pack of fins 12 and tubes 13 arranged in alternate layers. As shown inFigure 2, each of the tubes 13 is made up of an upper pressing 14 and a lower pressing 15 which are to be brazed together. At both ends of the tubes 13 there are apertures disposed in header portions of the tubes, through which pass feed tubes 16. The feed tubes are themselves provided with apertures not shown which allow oil to flow from one feed tube to the other by way of tubes 13. At the sides of the matrix are disposed side casings 17 and 18, respectively. Side casing 17 is secured to each of the feed tubes between an inlet and outlet fitting 19 swaged to the end portion of the feed tube, and an annular swaged portion 20.Side casing 18 is held in place between the matrix and an annular swaged portion 21 on the feed tube. A domed capping member 22 is fitted in the hollow of swaged portion 21 to closeXthe end of each feed tube. The arrangement shown may be assembled in different ways.A first method of assembly is to assemble first the fins 12 and tubes 13 in an assembly jig along with the side casings. The feed tubes are then slid through the apertures in the tubes 13 and the side casings and , with the matrix assembly subjected to a compressive loading, the various swaging operations are performed. A second method involves assembling the fins, tubes and side casings onto the feed tubes in an assembly jig, the swaging operations then being performed as above. With the arrangement thus assembled it can be reiilo from the assembly jig without risk of disassembly and may be passed on for being, The need to provide a combined assembly and brazing jig is thus avoided. The assembly is then brazed with the matrix again subjected to a compressive loading,to effect a closing up of the elements as the brazing metal on their surfaces melts. The closing up of the elements results in side casing 18 moving along the feed tubes from swaged portions 21 until the matrix is fully closed up, when the casing becomes brazed in position. It will be understood that although in the present embodiment swaging has been used to provide the necessary abutments on the feed tubes to prevent disassembly of the matrix, other forms of abutment could be used. For exaríple other methods could be used for expanding the end portion 21 indeed,the abutment could even take the form of a cap over the lower end of the feed tube which would also serve the purpose of closing the end of the tube. Again the inlet and outlet fitting 19 is by no means essential some form of abutment only being necessary. It will be clear that the abutment at one end of each feed tube could be provided prior to assembly of the heat exchanger.
