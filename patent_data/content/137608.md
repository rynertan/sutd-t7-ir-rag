## Description
ABSORBENT STRUCTURES COMPRISING VEGETABLEEMI1.1 TECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to novel absorbent structures comprising absorbent materials of vegetable origin. Disposable absorbent products e.g. disposable diapers, sanitary napkins, and the like generally contain absorbent webs of wood pulp fibers. Depending on the climate, it takes a tree from about 20 years to about 40 years to mature to a harvestable state. Consequently, to meet the demand of wood pulp fibers to be used in absorbent materials, vast areas of land are necessary for the growing of trees. As another consequence, even though wood pulp fibers are probably the most economical material for disposable absorbent products available today, substantial expenditures are being made in the harvesting and growing of the trees. There is therefore a continuing need for alternative, inexpensive absorbent materials, preferably from renewable resources. It has now been discovered that certain pectin containing agricultural by products can be converted to highly absorbent materials, suitable for use in disposable absorbent products, via a relatively simple and inexpensive process. Typical examples of agricultural by products suitable as raw materials for the absorbent materials of the present invention include the residue material from citrus juice processors and from sugar beet refineries.These materials are therefore abundantly available at low cost. The agricultural by products are converted to absorbent materials by a process preferably involving deesterification of the pectin methyl esters in the material, removal of water soluble organic materials e.g. carbohydrates or both. Preferred vegetable derived materials are prepared by a process Involving hydrolysis or partial hydrolysis of the pectin methyl esters present in waste materials and subsequent washing and drying of the material. The absorbent properties of the materials may be further improved by subjecting them to a bleaching step. Such a bleaching step also improves the appearance of the product, thereby making it more acceptable for use in disposable absorbent products. The vegetable derived absorbent materials typically have an absorbent capacity which Is from 2 to 5 times that of conventional wood pulp fiber webs.These materials therefore offer an opportunity to reduce the bulk of absorbent products while maintaining their containment capacity. It is therefore an object of this Invention to provide absorbent structures which comprise, in addition to a conventional absorbent material, a novel absorbent material of vegetable origin.It is a further object of this invention to provide disposable absorbent products, like disposable diapers and sanitary napkins, comprising the absorbent structure of the present invention. Background of the Invention The agricultural waste materials suitable as starting materials for the manufacture of the absorbent materials of the present invention are being produced in large quantities. The waste material from citrus juice processors, consisting of peels i.e. albedo and flavedo and rag, is generally processed to cattle feed by what has been termed the lime de watering process . This process comprises the steps of treating the waste with lime calcium oxide, calcium hydroxide, or even calcium carbonate to convert it from a slimy, unpressable condition to a watery, pressable condition pressing the converted waste and drying see, for example, U.S. Patent 2,147,521, issued February 14, 1939 to Florida Citrus Exchange U.S. Patent 2,215,944, issuedSeptember 24, 1943 to Vincente U.S. Patent 2,362,014, issuedNovember 7, 1944 to Citrus Processes, Inc. . Relatively small quantities of citrus waste are used as a source of pectin, which can be used as a thickening agent in food products. Food thickening agents may also be prepared by comminuting citrus peel material, and lowering the degree of esterification of the pectic materials in the citrus peel by enzymatic or chemical treatment. This approach has been disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,982,003 issued September 21, 1976 toMitchell et al., and in U.S. Patent 4,143,172, issued March 6, 10.

Data obtained by a different analytical method, however, may differ, which precludes a direct comparison with such data. In particular the pectin, cellulose and hemicellulose contents and the degree of esterification which are determined Indirectly, are parameters which are sensitive to the analytical method used. In the analytical protocol the water content of a sample of the material to be analyzed is determined by Karl Fischer titration. The amounts of calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium are determined by dry ashing followed by flame atomic absorption analysis of these metals. A third sample of the material is subjected to water extraction followed by a 40 hourSoxhlet extraction with chloroform. The amount of lipids in the extract is determined gravimetrically hereinafter referred to as chloroform soluble lipids . If the material to be analyzed does not contain components which are both water soluble and chloroform soluble, the water extraction prior to the chloroform extraction may be omitted.Thus, it has been found that a chloroform extract of citrus peel derived absorbent materials does not contain water soluble components, but that a sugar beet derived absorbent material does contain water soluble components in the chloroform extract. A citrus peel derived material may therefore be extracted with chloroform without prior water extraction, and an accurate reading of the amount of chloroform soluble lipids is obtained a sugar beet derived material, on the other hand, must be extracted with water prior to chloroform extraction in order to obtain an accurate determination of the amount of chloroform soluble lipids. A fourth sample is extracted with chloroform, and is subsequently subjected to a 40 hour Soxhlet extraction with chioroformimethanol water 20 4 1, vivid . tif the determination of chloroform soluble lipids was made without prior water extraction the residue of that test can be used for this chloroformimethanollwater extraction . The amount of extracted material, which is determined gravlmetrlcally, is the sum of the amounts of water soluble metal salts and non lipid organic materials.The metal cations are determined by flame ionization the amount of water soluble metal salts hereinafter referred to as water soluble metal salts is calculated therefrom using the molecular weight of the prevalent an Ion which Is known from the processing history of the sample in case of chlorine bleaching, for example, the prevalent anion is chloride . The amount of non lipid organic materials hereinafter referred to as non lipid organic materials is determined by subtracting the amount of water soluble metal salts from the total amount of material extracted with the chloroform methanol water mixture. The residue of the chloroformlmethanoi Iwater extraction contains cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, pectin and pectates. The residue is split in four parts one part is subjected to an acid hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose, followed by CC analysis of the aldononitrileperacetate derivatives of the sugars. The second part of the residue is analyzed for protein the proteln content is calculated from the nitrogen value which is determined colorimetrically using the Nessler reagent. The third part of the residue is analyzed for lignin, using the gravimetrical methodTAPPI T222 os 74. The fourth part of the residue is analyzed for calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium by dry ashing followed by flame atomic absorption analysis of the metals.The amount of pectin is calculated from the total amount of bound metals Is metals which cannot be removed by chloroform extraction or chloroform Imethanol Iwater extraction and the methoxy content. From the amounts of bound calcium and magnesium and the amount of pectin in the sample, the equivalent percent divalent metals is calculated as the equivalent percent of the polygalacturonic acid which is present as divalent metal salt.Likewise, the degree of esterification is calculated as the equivalent percent of the polygalacturonic acid which is present as the methyl ester, from the methoxy content and the total amount of pectin in the sample. The analytical protocol is illustracted by the flow chart ofFigure 1. The water content 1 is determined by Karl Fischer titratlon. The methoxy content 2 is determined by base hydrolysis followed by GC analysis of the liberated methanol.Total metals 3 are determined by dry ashing followed by flame atomic absorption analysis of the metals. LIpids 4 are determined by gravimetry after a 40 hour Soxhlet extraction with chloroform.The residue of the chloroform extraction is then subjected to a 40 hour Soxhlet extraction with chloroforml methanol Iwater 2014 1, vivid , other extractables 5 are determined gravimetrically. Lignin 6 Is determined by gravimetry usingTAPPI method T222 os 74. Protein 7 Is calculated from the nitrogen value which Is determined colorimetrically using theNessler reagent. Cellulose and hemicellulose 8 are determined by acid hydrolysis followed by GC analysis of the aldononitrileperacetate derivatives of the sugars. Bound metals 12 are determined by dry ashing followed by flame atomic absorption analysis of the metals. Pectin 9 Is calculated from the sum of the methoxy content 2 and bound metals 12. From bound calcium 12 and pectin 9 is calculated the equivalent percent calcium 11.From methoxy content 2 and pectin 9 is calculated the degree of esterification 10 as equivalent percent of polygalacturonic acid which Is present as the methyl ester. Pectin , as determined by this method is the material in the composition which is capable of forming methyl esters or binding metals, calculated as polygalacturonic acid. The underlying assumptions are that the pectin does not contain any free acid groups, that all of the pectin is anhydrogalacturonic acid, and that no insoluble alkaline earth metal salts, other than calcium salts, are present. These assumptions have been verified by independent methods to be correct within a reasonable margin of confidence. The sum of cellulose and hemicellulose is taken to be the total of neutral sugars left in the sample after the extractions with chloroform and the chioroformlmethanol Jwatej mixture. Cellulose may be determined separately as the total amount of glucose. The balance of neutral sugars is hemicellulose, It has been discovered that the pectin in the composition plays an important part in determining the absorbent properties of the material. Although compositions differ among species and within species, more than 60 of the pectin in vegetable materials is generally present in the form of the methyl ester. In the case of orange peels, on the order of 20 Is present as the calcium salt the balance is generally In the protonated form, or an alkali metal salt, mostly potassium. Preferred vegetable derived absorbent materials for use in the absorbent structures of the present invention are materials in which the pectin has a degree of esterification of less than 45 , more preferably less than 20 .In order to obtain a degree of esterification of less than 45 , the the vegetable starting material must be subjected to a deesterification step which may be carried out by alkaline treatment at a pH of from 8 to 13, or by an enzyme such as pectin esterase. The enzyme is naturally present in citrus peel. Care should be taken that the amount of divalent metal pectates is not substantially increased. In particular, calcium pectates have been found to be detrimental to the absorption properties of the material. Moreover, the calcium pectates once formed cannot be readily converted to other pectic materials like alkali metal salts or pectic acids, In general, the total equivalent of divalent metals must be less than 50 . The equivalent of calcium is preferably less than 30 . In practical terms this means that calcium hydroxide or calcium carbonate cannot be used for alkaline deesterification. It is not necessary, however, to use distilled or deionized water tap water has been found to not significantly reduce the absorbent properties of the materials, provided the water hardness does not exceed 7 grainsigalion corresponding to 120 ppm CaCO3 and provided that no excessive amounts of water are used. The term soft water as used herein therefore refers to water having a degree of hardness of less than 7 grainslgallon less than 120 ppm CaCO3 . In particular when citrus waste is used, the vegetable starting material may contain complex mixtures of lipids and lipid like materials, and other non polymeric organic materials.The absorbent properties of the resulting absorbent material may be greatly enhanced by removing these organic extractable materials. It has been discovered that the organic extractables generally belong to one of two classes a first class of materials which are soluble in chloroform and which have been identified as mostly non polar lipids these materials are referred to herein as chloroform soluble lipids and a second class of materials which are not soluble in chloroform alone, but which are soluble in a mixture of chloroform, methanol and water chloroform methanol water 20 4 1 vlvlv . This second class of materials is comprised of non lipid organic materials and of water soluble metal salts. For use in the absorbent structures of the present invention, the vegetable derived absorbent materials may not contain more than 4 chloroform soluble lipids, preferably less than 1 . It is further critical that the vegetable derived absorbent material not comprise more than 35 of non lipid organic materials extractable in a mixture of chloroform, methanol and water chloroform methanol water 20 4 1 v vlv . Preferably, the vegetable derived absorbent material contains less than 10 of such non lipid organic materials. It is also preferred that the vegetable derived absorbent materials comprise less than 6 water soluble metal salts. Hence, the present invention relates to absorbent structures comprising 1 from 1 to 99 of a vegetable derived absorbent material which comprises by weight of the vegetable derived absorbent material a from 15 to 60 pectin, less than 50 of which is in the form of a divalent metal salt b from 15 to 80 of a material selected from cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, and mixtures thereof c from 0 to 4 chloroform soluble lipids d from 0 to 35 non lipid organic materials extractable in a mixture of chloroform, methanol and water, said mixture having a volume ratio chloroform methanol water of 20 4 1 and 2 from 18 to 99 of a conventional absorbent material. Although the degree of esterification of the pectin does not appear to have a major effect on the ultimate absorption capacity of the absorbent material, low degrees of esterification are conducive to good wicking properties of the material. High wicking rates are important for a fast uptake of liquid. For use in absorbent products like disposable diapers, sanitary napkins and the like, good wicking properties of the absorbent material are highly desirable. The absorbent materials therefore preferably contain pectin which has a degree of esterification of less than 45 , more preferably less than 206. The second major component of the vegetable derived absorbent material, next to pectin, is generally a mixture of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. The actual composition of this mixture is to a large extent determined by the choice of the raw material, and to a lesser extent by the process. For example, hemicellulose is likely to be partially removed during processing, which increases the relative amounts of cellulose and lignin in the mixture. Depending on the raw material source, the amount of lignin may be very small. For example, citrus waste has a much lower lignin level than beet pulp yet very good absorbent materials can be prepared from either starting material. It has been discovered that divalent metal pectates, in particular calcium pectates, are far inferior to alkali metal pectates e.g. sodium pectates with regard to absorbent properties. This is probably due to the fact that diva lent metal salts of pectin are cross llnked , whereby the divalent metal Ion serves as the link between two adjacent pectin molecules. This cross linking Is believed to prevent swelling of the pectin and to thereby reduce its absorbent capacity. Some of the pectin is naturally present as the calcium salt. Care must be taken not to increase the amount of calcium pectate any further. Therefore, during processing the materials should not be exposed to excessive amounts of calcium.If calcium is present in the form of an insoluble mineral salt which is not capable of interacting with the esterified pectin, the presence of calcium is probably not harmful at all. One specific embodiment of this invention is an absorbent structure comprising 1 from . 1 to 99 of a citrus peel derived absorbent material which comprises, by weight of the citrus peel derived absorbent material a from 30 to 60 pectin, said pectin having a degree of esterification of less than 20 , and less than 30 of the pectin being in the form of a calcium salt b from 30 to 60 of a mixture of cellulose and hemicellulose c from 0 to 1P chloroform soluble lipids d from 0 to 10 non lipid organic materials extractable in a mixture of chloroform, methanol and water, said mixture having a volume ratio chloroform methanol water of 20 4 1 e from 0 to 6 water soluble metal salts and 2 from 1 to 99 of a conventional absorbent material. A second specific embodiment of this invention is an absorbent structure comprising 1 from 1 to 99 of a sugar beet derived absorbent material which comprises, by weight of the sugar beet derived material a from 15 to about 35 pectin, said pectin having a degree of esterification of less than 45 preferably less than 20 , and less than 30 of the pectin being in the form of a calcium salt b from 20 to 80 of a mixture of cellulose and hemicellulose c from 0 to 1 chloroform soluble lipids d from 0 to 10 non lipid organic materials extractable in a mixture of chloroform, methanol and water, said mixture having a volume ratio chloroform methanol water of 20 4 1 e from 0 to 6 water soluble metal salts and 2 from 1 to 99 of a conventional absorbent material. Process for Preparing the Vegetable Derived Absorbent Material The process necessary for preparing the vegetable derived absorbent material from the pectin containing starting material depends to a large extent on the starting material being used. The process is aimed at removing excessive amounts of extractable materials, and preferably at reducing the degree of esterification of the pectin in the material as well. For example, vegetable derived absorbent materials may be obtained from citrus peels using the process described in U.S. Patent 3,982,003, issued September 21, 1976 to Mltchell et al..The process described in this reference results in vegetable derived absorbent material of acceptable quality, in particular when the flavedo Is removed from the orange peels prior to processing, as described in Example 7 therein.However, the process described in Mitchell does not comprise a bleaching or a washing step. The products obtained by theMitchell process therefore tend to contain relatively high levels of chloroform soluble lipids, and to be relatively dark in color. Acceptable vegetable derived absorbent materials are also obtained from citrus peels or sugar beet pulp using the process described In U.S. Patent 4,379,782, issued April 12, 1983 toStaub et awl.. The process described in this reference results in absorbent material of acceptable quality, especially when sugar beet pulp is used as the starting material. However, the process described in Staub does not comprise a deesterification step. As a consequence, the materials possess relatively poor wicking properties. Preferred is a process which comprises the steps of a comminuting a pectin containing vegetable material to a particle size of from 0.05 mm to 3 mm b de esterifying the pectin to a degree of esterification of less than 45 c washing the vegetable material in soft water and d drying the vegetable material to a moisture content of less than its . The manner In which the deesterification is carried out Is not critical and may, for example, be enzymatic or chemical. Chemical deesterification of pectin may be carried out at acid or alkaline pH. Acid deesterification is not preferred as it is slow and leads to both divalent ion extraction and hemicellulose degradation. Alkaline deesterification is preferred but care must be exercised. Pectin methyl ester can degrade via a beta elimination mechanism, so pti and temperature should be carefully controlled. Enzymatic deesterification may be carried out with the enzyme pectinesterase this is particularly convenient when citrus peels are used as starting material because the enzyme pectinesterase is naturally present In citrus peels.Alternatively, deesterification may be carried out by soaking the vegetable material particles in a solution of an alkali metal hydroxide. The reaction rate increases with the concentration of hydroxyl ions, therefore the higher the pH, the faster the reaction will be. The pH should therefore be above about 8, preferably above 9. Excessively high pH values tend to result in removal of hemicellulose and other desirable materials.Therefore, the pH should not exceed 13, and preferably be below 12. A degree of esterification of less than 45 is generally achieved after 2 minutes at pH 9.5 or greater.As beta elimination is very temperature dependent, a temperature of 250C or lower is preferred. Prolonged contacting of the vegetable material with the alkali hydroxide solution results in a progressively lower degree of esterification of the pectin. It is generally not necessary to continue this deesterification step for more than 2 hours, since little additional benefit is obtained by doing so. The washing of the material is very important, since it is necessary to remove the alkaline material and excess soluble materials. Washing may be done with water or with an organic solvent. The latter has the advantage that chloroform soluble lipids which may be present in the material are generally to some extent removed by an organic solvent like acetone, but not by a water wash. The washing step may be conveniently carried out as follows. Excess liquid is drained off from the reaction mixture of the deesterification step. Then, enough of the washing liquid i.e. water or an organic solvent is added in order to obtain a slurry with a solids content of 2 . The slurry is equilibrated for 5 to 15 minutes, and then the washing liquid is drained off. This washing step may be repeated.The number of washing steps is determined by the amount of contaminants in the starting material and the desired composition of the finished absorbent material. Typically, 2 or 3 washing steps will be necessary. After excess washing liquid has been drained off after the last washing step, the liquid content of the remaining material is on the order of 90 . This must be reduced to less than 208 in order to obtain an absorbent material with optimum absorption properties. If an organic solvent Is used in the washing step e.g. acetone, isopropyl alcohol, or methanol , this solvent may be simply removed by evaporating it. The material may also be dried by solvent displacement after the last washing step with water, the material is slurried up with an organic solvent like acetone or methanol, the solvent is then drained off and the excess is evaporated. For economic reasons it may not be feasible to use any organic solvents in the process. in that case, water will have to be removed using a conventional drying technique. This may be either freeze drying, vacuum drying, or thermal drying. Of these three, freeze drying is the most attractive because It does not cause collapse of the fine capillaries which are naturally present in the material. Unfortunately, freeze drying is also the most expensive drying method of these three. Thermal drying is economically the most attactive method of drying available. If the 90 moisture product from the washing step is dried in an oven, a board like material is obtained which is not very absorbent. It has been discovered, however, that the material may be dried by spraying It into a counter current of superheated steam or heated air. The inlet temperature and the flow rate should be controlled as to result in an outlet temperature in the range of from 600C to 75or. This results In a product which has a moisture content of less than 15 . Although thermally dried materials possess good absorption capacities, the absorption kinetics of such materials tend to be slow. The rate of absorption can be vastly improved by adding a surfactant to the slurry during the last washing step.An amount of surfactant of from 1 to 3 by weight of the amount of the slurry is generally sufficient. The type of surfactant is not critical. Examples of suitable surfactants are nonionic surfactants, e.g. ethoxylated fatty alcohols. It is highly desirable to include in the process a bleaching step. Preferably, the bleaching is carried out with an oxidative bleaching agent. Examples of suitable bleaching agents are hydrogen peroxide, perborate, hypochlorite, chlorine dioxide and chlorine. Sodium hypochlorite is a preferred bleaching agent.For optimum properties of the absorbent material, and optimum safety of absorbent products made therewith, excess bleach and electrolytes introduced during the bleaching step will have to be removed. Bleaching is therefore best carried out prior to the washing steps. Since color. compounds may be formed during alkaline deesterification, the bleaching step is best carried out subsequent to the deesterification step if alkaline deesterification is used as opposed to enzymatic deesterification . In order to improve the effective use of the bleaching agent, it is desirable to include a washing step subsequent to the deesterification step and prior to the bleaching step, especially when citrus peels are the starting material. Hence, in case alkaline deesterification and bleaching are used, the process sequence is as follows a communiting the pectin containing vegetable material to a particle size of from 0.05 mm to 3 mm b soaking the pectin containing vegetable material particles obtained in step a in a solution of an alkali metal hydroxide in water at a pH of from 9 to 12 and at a temperature of from 150C to 500C, for a period of from 2 minutes to 120 minutes c washing the product of step b in soft water d bleaching the product of step c for from 5 minutes to 60 minutes e washing the product of step d in soft water and f drying the product of step le . The effect of bleaching is two fold. It removes color materials, thereby vastly improving the appearance of the absorbent material obtained by this process, and making it more suitable for use in consumer products like disposable diapers, sanitary napkins and the like. Bleaching further tends to decompose chloroform soluble lipids Into water soluble fragments.Consequently, the bleaching step significantly reduces the level of chloroform soluble materials in the finished product. The removal of chloroform soluble lipids is particularly important when citrus peels are used as the starting material.Citrus peels contain high levels of such chloroform soluble lipids, and if water as opposed to organic solvents is used in the washing steps of the process, bleaching is instrumental in reducing the level of chloroform soluble lipids to the desired level. Although whole citrus peels may be used as the starting material, the flavedo part greatly increases the load of chloroform soluble lipids and colored materials. It is therefore desirable to remove the flavedo part of the peel. The flavedo may be shaved off mechanically by machinery which is commercially available and designed for this purpose. Such equipment typically leaves about 30 of the flavedo on the albedo.It has been discovered that when these machine shaved peels are subjected to the process described hereinabove including the bleaching step an absorbent material is obtained which is negligibly less absorbent than the material obtained from an handmade all albedo starting material, Whole citrus peels may also be used as starting material. Highly acceptable absorbent materials may be made therefrom, albeit at the expense of a higher usage of bleaching chemicals. Sugar beets, by their nature, contain only low levels of chloroform soluble lipids. When processing sugar beet waste, one may therefore forego the bleaching step if absorbent properties are the only concern. However, during alkaline deesterification, beet pulp develops a persistent green color and a bleaching step may be highly desirable or even necessary from an aesthetics viewpoint. The processing of other pectin containing raw materials will have become apparent from the foregoing. The bleaching step may be foregone If the starting material has a low chloroform soluble lipid content, and contains little colored materials or If the aesthetics of the absorbent material are relatively unimportant e.g. when intended for industrial use .The choice of the method of deesterification enzymatic or alkaline treatment is largely determined by economic determinations enzymatic deesterification is relatively slow alkaline treatment is faster and lends itself better to a continuous operation of the process. The choice of the washing liquid water or an organic solvent is likewise determined by economic considerations with which a person skilled in chemical engineering may be deemed well familiar. By conventional absorbent material herein is meant any absorbent material which is being used, or has been proposed for use, in absorbent products like disposable diapers, sanitary napkins, disposable towels, facial tissues, toilet tissues, incontinent pads, and the like. Examples therefore include absorbent fibers and water insoluble hydrogels. Examples of absorbent fibers include vegetable fibers like cotton fibers, wood pulp fibers e.g., Kraft pulp fibers, chemo thermo mechanical pulp fibers , and fibers of abaca, sisal, henequen, cantala, istle, mauritirus, phornium, sansevieria, caroa, piassava, broomroot, flax, hemp, ramie, jute, kenaf, roselle, urena, coir and kapok.It should be noted that the above fibers, although probably encompassed by the dictionary meaning of vegetable derived absorbent materials , as defined herein do not fail under that term, but rather are encompassed by the term conventional absorbent material . Examples of absorbent fibers further include man made fibers like rayon, cellulose acetate, cellulose triacetate, alginate fibers, protein fibers, polyamide, nylon 6,6, nylon 6, aromatic polyamides, polyester, acrylic fibers, polyethene and polypropene fibers. Many of the man made fibers are hydrophobic, but can be hydrophilized using art disclosed techniques. Hydrophobic fibers may be hydrophilized by surfactant treatment, as disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,916,447, issued November 4, 1975, to Thompson and in U.S. Patent 4110013241 issued July 11, 1978 to Anderson et al.. Thermoplastic fibers may further be hydrophilized by coating with a hydrophilic material, e.g. silica, or by surface grafting the fibers with hydrophilic groups. By hydrogel as used herein Is meant an inorganic or organic compound capable of absorbing aqueous fluids and retain ing them under moderate pressures. For good results, the hydrogels must be water Insoluble. Examples are Inorganic materials such as silica gels and organic compounds such as cross linked polymers. Cross linking may be by covalent, Ionic, vander Waals, or hydrogen bonding. Examples of polymers include polyacrylamides, polyvinyl alcohol, ethylene maleic anhydride copolymers, polyvinyl ethers, hydroxypropyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, polyvinyl morpholinone, polymers and copolymers of vinyl sulfonic acid, polyacrylates, polyacrylamides, polyvinyl pyridine and the like. Other suitable hydrogels are those disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,901,236, issued to Assarsson et al., August 26, 1975. Particularly preferred polymers for use herein are hydrolyzed acrylonitrile grafted starch, acrylic acid grafted starch, polyacrylates, and isobutylene maleic anhydride copolymers, or mixtures thereof. Processes for preparing hydrogels are disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,076,663, issued February 28, 1978 to Fusayoshi Masuda et al. in U.S. Patent 4,286,082, issued August 25, 1981 toTsuno Tsubakimoto et al. and further in U.S. Patents 3,734,876, 3,661,815, 3,670,731, 3,664,343, 3,783,871, and Belgian Patent 785,858 One specific embodiment of the present invention is an absorbent structure comprising a vegetable absorbent material and a conventional absorbent fiber. Preferred for use herein are cellulose fibers, In particular wood pulp fibers. In a preferred embodiment the absorbent structure comprises from 5 to 80 vegetable absorbent material, and from 208 to 95 wood pulp fiber. The vegetable absorbent material and the conventional absorbent fiber can be combined In a variety of ways to form the absorbent structures of the present invention. For example, vegetable absorbent material can be mixed with conventional absorbent fibers, and the mixture formed into a web or particulate vegetable absorbent material can be introduced into a web of conventional absorbent fibers in a certain pattern, so as to create areas of increased absorbent capacity within the absorbent structure or the vegetable absorbent material can be pressed into a sheet which is then placed against a web, or sandwiched inbetween webs of the conventional absorbent fibers. Other executions will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The vegetable absorbent material as obtained from the process described hereinabove is generally In particulate or fibrous form. The material can be put into sheet form by applying pressure to wet laid material, and subsequent drying. Another specific embodiment of the present invention Is an absorbent structure comprising a vegetable derived absorbent material, conventional absorbent fibers like wood pulp fibers, and a water insoluble hydrogel, specifically polyacrylate grafted starch or slightly crosslinked polyacrylate material. Preferred are absorbent structures comprising from 40 to 60 wood pulp fiber, from 20 to 40 vegetable absorbent material and from 10 to 25 water insoluble hydrogel. The absorbent structures may conveniently be made by using conventional equipment designed for air laying of hydrophilic fibrous webs. In such equipment, webs are typically formed by taking up hydrophilic fibers in an air flow and depositing the fibers on a wire mesh screen. By metering the desired quantities of vegetable absorbent material particles or fiber particles into the air flow at a point Just upstream of the wire mesh screen, the desired mixture of hydrophilic fibers and hydrogel particles can be made. The web formed on the screen is then passed through calender rolls which are set to a nip pressure resulting in the desired density of the absorbent structure . It will be clear that this embodiment of the process requires only minor modIfications of conventIonal equipment for the manufacture of absorbent structures, I.e.Installing a metering device for the addition of the vegetable absorbent material particles or fibers. In certain instances it may be necessary to replace the standard wire mesh screen on the equipment with one of a finer mesh size. This need will arise when relatively small hydrogel particles are used, and or when the mesh size of the standard screen is relatively coarse. Optionally, the structures may be compressed to a higher density than that of conventional air laid wood pulp fiber webs i.e., a density higher than 0.1 gicm3 by increasing the nip pressure on the calender rolls. The densified absorbent structures have good absorbent properties, in spite of the reduced void volume of such structures. This is due to the wet resiliency exhibited by the material. It regains virtually all of its original volume if wetted in a densified state and therefore exhibits its high absorbency in both an uncompressed and compressed state unlike wood pulp fiber webs which become distinctly less absorbent upon compression .The densified structures therefore have properties low bulk, high absorbency which are highly desirable for absorbent products like disposable diapers, incontinent pads and sanitary napkins. The densified structures have a density of from 0.2 glcm to 1 g cm3, preferably from 0.3 to 0.5 gtcm3. Alternatively, an absorbent structure may be formed by placing a web of absorbent fibers against a sheet of vegetable absorbent material. Optionally, the sheet andlor the web may be wrapped in envelope tissue, to increase the lateral strength of the structure. Alternatively, an absorbent structure can be formed by mixing absorbent fibers, e.g., wood pulp fibers, and particles of the vegetable absorbent material in an aqueous slurry admixing a surfactant and foaming with air. The foamed slurry is then conveyed onto a wire screen and dewatered, preferably by apply ing vacuum to the underside of the wire screen. The foamed mat thus obtalned Is subsequently dried In air. A more detailed description of the foaming process Is disclosed in U. S. Patent 3,871,952, Issued March 18, 1975 to Robertson, The absorbent structures of the present invention encompass structures comprising the vegetable absorbent material and a water lnsoluble hydrogel.Examples include structures comprising a mixture of hydrogel particles or fibers and particles or fibers of the vegetable absorbent material and laminates comprising one or more sheets of hydrogel material and one or more sheets of vegetable absorbent material, e.g. a laminate of one sheet of water insoluble hydrogel placed against a sheet of vegetable absorbent material, or a sandwich type laminate, comprising a sheet of water insoluble hydrogel material placed in between two sheets of vegetable absorbent material. Many varIations are possible, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. A preferred embodiment Is an absorbent structure comprising a mixture of from 50 to 95 vegetable absorbent material and from 5 to 50 of a water insoluble hydrogel. Both the hydrogel and the vegetable absorbent material are preferably in particulate or fibrous form. The mixture can be densified to a density of 1 gicm3 without significant loss of absorption capacity. The densified structures have better wet strength and dry strength than nondensified structures. Moreover, the densified structures can be used for making low bulk absorbent products like diapers and sanitary napkins which are highly desirable from a consumer standpoint. Densified structures, having a density of from 0.2 to 1 gicm3, are therefore preferred. More preferred are structures having a density of from 0.3 to 0.5 gicm3. Excellent absorbent structures are also obtained upon mixing of hydrophilic fibers, particles or fibers of the vegetable absorbent material, and particles or fibers of a water insoluble hydrogel. The three components can be mixed in any ratio.Preferred are structures comprising from 30 to 80 hydrophilic fibers from 10 to 50 vegetable absorbent material and from 5 to 50 water insoluble hydrogel. More preferred are structures comprising from 40 to 70 hydrophilic fibers from 20 to s 40 vegetable absorbent material and from 5 to 258 water insoluble hydrogel. The performance of these three component structures is improved by densifying the structures to a density of from 0.2 to 1 g cm3, preferably from 0.3 to 0.5 g cm3. To improve the strength of the absorbent structures of the present invention the structures can be mixed with a small amount typically from 0.5 to 5 of a long thermoplastic fiber. As used herein, long fiber means a fiber having a length of more than 1 Inch 2.5 cm . Suitable thermoplastic materials are inexpensive polymers like polyethylene, polypropylene and polyester. Polyester fibers are preferred because they are more hydrophilic than polyolefin fibers. The use of thermoplastic fibers in absorbent structures for the purpose of improving the strength of such structures is described in more detail in U.S. Patent 4,307,721, issued December 29, 1981 to Tsuchiya et awl., U.S. Patent 4,219,024, issued August 26, 1980 to Patience et al. and in U.S.Patent 4,100,329, issued July 11, 1978 to Anderson et al.. Because of their particular properties, the absorbent structures of this invention are extremely suitable for use in disposable absorbent products. By absorbent product herein is meant a consumer product which is capable of absorbing significant quantities of water and other fluids, like body fluids. Examples of absorbent products include disposable diapers, sanitary napkins, incontinent pads, paper towels, facial tissues, and the like.The absorbent structures of the present invention are particularly suitable for use in products like diapers, incontinent pads, and sanitary napkins. It is possible to design absorbent products which are thin and yet have more than sufficient absorbent capacity to avoid the embarrassment of failure. Flexibility of the structure ensures comfort for the wearer and a good fit of the absorbent product. Disposable diapers comprising the absorbent structures of the present invention may be made by using conventional diaper making techniques, but replacing the wood pulp fiber web core which is typically used in conventional diapers with an absorbent structure of the present invention. Thus, a disposable diaper may be comprised of from top to bottom a top sheet a nonwoven, hydrophobic tissue, e.g. needle punched polyester , the absorbent structure, and a waterproof, pliable back sheet e.g. hard polyethylene, having an embossed caliper of approximately 2.3 mils. . Optionally, the absorbent structure may be wrappedIn envelope tissue wet strength tissue paper . Disposable diapers of this type are disclosed in more detail in U.S. Patent 3,952,745, Issued April 27, 1976 to Duncan and In U.S. Patent 3,860,003, issued January 14, 1975 to Buell. The diaper may further comprise a second absorbent core, like a wood pulp fiber web, or a sheet of water insoluble hydrogel. Because the absorbent structures of the present invention are highly absorbent, and yet thin and flexible, they are extremely suitable for use in sanitary napkins. As is the case with disposable diapers, sanitary napkins utilizing the present absorbent structures may be derived from conventional sanitary napkins by simply replacing the absorbent core thereof typically a web of wood pulp fibers with an absorbent structure of the present invention. Such replacement may be on a weight byweight basis, which results in a reduction in volume and a gain in capacity or the replacement may be on a less than equal weight basis, thereby sacrificing part of the gain in absorbent capacity in favor of an even greater reduction in bulk. An example of a sanitary napkin comprises a pad of the absorbent structure of the present Invention a hydrophobic topsheet and a fluid impervious bottom sheet. The topsheet and the backsheet are placed at opposite sides of the absorbent structure. Optionally, the absorbent structure is wrapped In envelope tissue. Suitable materials for top sheets, bottom sheet and envelope tissue are well known In the art. A more detailed description of sanitary napkins and suitable materials for use therein is found in U.S. Patent 3,871,378, issued March 18, 1975 to Duncan et al.. Example One Florida Valencia oranges juiced with an AMC Extractor were hand shaved to remove the flavedo and rag. The albedo was ground in an Urschei Grinder. Twenty three pounds about 10 kg of the ground raw material, at 11.96 solids, was slurried in 75 pounds of water about 3.4 kg , making a 2.8 solids slurry,The slurry was titrated to pH 9.5 and maintained at this pH by caustic addition for 30 minutes. The titration took 1.25 liters of 1N sodium hydroxide. The material was dewatered in a basket centrifuge. It was washed with 75 pounds about 34 kg of water while spinning in the centrifuge, and dewatered again. The 14.7 pounds t6.7 kg of filter cake at 10.71 solids that resulted from this was slurried in 43 pounds 19.5 kg of water, making a 2.8 solids slurry. 3.8 liters of 5.25 sodium hypochlorite solution were added to the slurry and mixed for 15 minutes. The bleached material was dewatered in the centrifuge. It was washed again with 75 pounds about 34 kg of water while spinning and then dewatered. This resulted in 12.2 pounds of material at 10.3 solids for a yield of 45.7 . The material was freeze dried to a moisture content of about 10 .

The resulting structures possess excellent absorbent properties. Example Three Citrus peel absorbent material prepared as described inExample One was dry mixed with southern soft wood Kraft pulp fibers, in a ratio of 2 3. Webs having dimensions of 15 x 25 cm, were prepared in batch type air laying equipment. The webs were compressed to a dry density of 0.3 g cm3, using a flat hydraulic press, corresponding to a thickness of 2.6 mm. The absorbent structures had a weight of 30 g, and a final basis weight of 800 g m2. Disposable diapers utilizing the above absorbent structure were prepared as follows. The absorbent structures were enveloped in wet strength tissue paper having a basis weight of 12 pounds per 3,000 square feet about 20 git2 , a dry tensile strength of 700 glinch 275 glcm in the machine direction and 300 glinch 120 gicm in the cross machine direction. The enveloped pad was glued onto a 7 in. x 11 in. 18 cm x 28 cm backsheet of embossed polyethylene film having a melt index of 3 and a density of 0. 92 g cm3, The ends of the backsheet were folded over the enveloped pad and attached with glue. Finally, the absorbent pad was covered with a topsheet of a hydrophobic but water and urIne pervious material. Webilne No. F 6211 from the Kendall Co. of Walpole,Massachusetts, comprised of a non woven rayon bonded with an acrylic latex . Control diapers of the same design were made, using wood pulp fiber webs of 0.1 glcm3 density basis weight 960 glmz, core weight 36 g instead of the absorbent structures of 0.3 gicm3 density. To test the performance of the diapers, the diapers were worn by normal infants in a leakage study. The infants were allowed to play In a nursery school setting during the test. The diapers were left on the infants until leakage occurred. In order to speed up the test, the diapers were pre loaded with a predetermined amount of synthetic urine. After leakage occurred, the diapers were taken off and weighed to determine the amount of absorbed fluid. The loadingX, defined as the amount of fluid in grams absorbed at the point that failure occurred per gram of absorbent material, was calculated. The absorption capacity of the diapers containing the absorbent structure according to the present invention was equal to the capacity of the control diapers even though the core weight was 6 g less 30 g as compared to 36 g . Hence, with the absorbent structures of the present invention, a significant reduction In the consumption of wood pulp fibers can be obtained, without sacrificing absorption performance. Similar diapers are prepared, using the sugar beet absorbent material of Example Two Instead of the citrus peel absorbent material. Essentially the same results are obtained. Example Four Sanitary napkins employing an absorbent structure pursuant to this invention are prepared as follows An absorbent structure, prepared as In Example Three, Is calendered to a density of 0.4 g cm3 as measured under a confining pressure of 0.1 PSI 7 x 103 Elm2 . The web is cut into a pad of 8 in. x 2 in. . 20 cm x 5 cm with tapered ends. On top of this pad Is placed a second pad rectangular of 5 in. X 2 in. 13 cm x 5 cm . The combined pad structure is placed against a waterproof backing sheet 8 in. x 2 in., tapered of embossed hard polyethylene having an embossed caliper of 2.3 mils.The structure is covered with a top sheet of non woven, 3 denier needle punched polyester fabric having a density of 0.03 glcm3 and a caliper of 2.3 mm. The thus covered structure is placed on a 9 in. x 3 in. i, 23 cm x 7.5 cm bottom sheet of hydrophobic, spinbonded non woven polyester having a measured weight of 15 glum . The bottom sheet is prefolded upwardly by means of heat and pressure which bonds the superposed sheets together. The resulting absorbent structure is useful as a sanitary napkin and has excellent properties of absorption and containment of menses exudate. Example Five A polyester reinforced absorbent structure was prepared as follows. 2 g of 6 denier polyester fiber, fiber length 4 in. about 10 cm were carded and formed into an unbonded web.The web had a basis weight of 0.5 oz yard2 19 g m2 . A web of 6 in. x 10 in. 15 cm x 25 cm was placed on a wire screen which was covered with a tissue. A mixture was formed of particles of a citrus peel absorbent material, prepared as described in Example One and particles of an acrylic acid grafted starch Sanwet 1M 1000 , from SanyoCo., Ltd., Japan in a weight ratio 4 1 15 g of this mixture were poured over the polyester fiber web, and forced into the web by reducing the air pressure under the wire screen. The resulting structure was compressed in a flat hydraulic press to a density of 0.3 g cm3. The final composition was citrus peel absorbent material 12 g 76.4 acrylic acid grafted starch 3 g 19.1 polyester fiber 0.7 g 4.5 The absorbent structures were used for the preparation of diapers as described in Example Three. The diapers containing these absorbent structures had a 158 228 higher absorption capacity at the point of leakage than control diapers containing a wood pulp fiber web having a density of 0.1 g cm3, and a basis weight of 960 glum core weight of 36 93 Hence, this embodiment of the present invention makes it possible to manufacture absorbent products which have a higher absorbent capacity and reduced bulk as compared to conventIonal diapers which contain a wood pulp fiber web as an absorbent core. Absorbent structures are prepared using a 4 1 mixture of sugar beet absorbent material, prepared as described in ExampleTwo, and a copolymer of isobutylene and malelc anhydride KI Gel 201, from Kuraray, Japan substantially similar results are obtained. Example Six Sugar beet absorbent material prepared as described inExample Two was formed into diaper core test pads as follows A 4 x 4 10 x 10 cm square of tissue was laid onto a flat surface. On top of the tissue 2.42 grams of SAM was evenly spread. Another 4 x 4 10 x 10 cm square of tissue was laid on top. Two such pads were prepared. One was left uncompressed while the second was placed in a hydraulic press between flat steel plates and compressed to a density of 0.30 g cm3. The absorbency of the compressed pad was essentially equal to that of the uncompressed pad. Example Seven Sugar beet absorbent material was prepared as described inExample Two, except that the drying step Involved a solvent replacement with Isopropanol. The sugar beet absorbent material was mixed with southern slash pine Kraft pulp fibers and par tides of a polyacrylate grafted starch water insoluble hydrogel Sanwet IM 1000 from Sanyo Ltd., Japan. Approximate composition starch 10 acrylic acid 22 sodlum acrylate 68 methylene blsacrylamlde crosslinking agent 0.2 . The materials were mixed In the following quantItIes by weight wood pulp fibers 50 sugar beet absorbent material 32 polyacrylate grafted starch 18 . The mixture was formed into a web having a basis weight of 0.144 glmz by airlaying. The web was densified in a hydraulic press to a density of 0.25 glcml. The web was then cut into rectangular cores of 10 x 16 in. 25 x 40 cm . The cores were envelope wrapped In wet strength tissue paper and Incorporated Into a diaper as described In Example Three.
