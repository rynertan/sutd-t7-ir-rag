# Apparatus for reproducing digital information via a transmission medium.

## Abstract
An apparatus is described for reproducing digital infor mation via a transmission medium, in particular an optically readable disc. In order to measure the phase difference be tween a channel clock and the intersections of the data signal being read with a decision level, samples on both sides of said intersections are interpolated and the amplitudes of the sam ples are compared with the decision level. The amplitude dif ference is a measure of the phase difference.
