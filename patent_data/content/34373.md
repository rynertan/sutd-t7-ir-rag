# Apparatus for controlling an air conditioner for a vehicle.

## Abstract
The temperature of the interior of a motor vehicle is controlled by an air conditioner in relation to a temperature setting which is variable in response to an action of a vehicle occupant. A voice synthesizer 17 is supplied with a vocal information data supplied from a microcomputer 13 in response to the entry thereto of a temperature resetting command. The voice synthesizer generates a vocal announcement of a temperature to which the initial setting is varied. Vocal announcements of successively varying temp erature values are generated until a desired value is reached.
