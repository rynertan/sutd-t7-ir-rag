# Compactor.

## Abstract
A compactor which includes two laterally spaced impact rollers 70,72 on an axle 74 which constrains the rollers to rotate in synchronism. The axle includes a first component 80 which transmits bending moments, and a second component 90 which transfers torsional forces, between the rollers. The spaced impact rollers make it possible to compact embankment edges and increase the stability of the com pactor.
