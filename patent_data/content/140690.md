# REFLECTOR FOR A TUBULAR LIGHTING ELEMENT

## Abstract
This invention discloses a lighting installation which employs a reflector shield of a certain shape which is de signed to provide non directionalized reflection of light back into the room which would otherwise be lost towards the ceiling around the installation. The reflector 1 has a highly reflective surface and comprises an elongate mem ber having two wings 4 disposed symmetrically about a line 5 at which they join together. Each wing 4 has a plu rality of facets each running the full lenght of the wing and which are positioned at gratatory angles to one another so that the light from the lighting element is reflected down wardly and diffusely therefrom. This reflector maximizes the reflection of the light and reduces the number of light fix tures required.
