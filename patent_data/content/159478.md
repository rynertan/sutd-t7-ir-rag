# IMPROVED CHANNEL CONNECTOR

## Abstract
An improved channel connector for channel members, used in mechanical fastening systems for mechanically securing a flexible sheet relative thereto, each channel member being of generally rectangular form, transverse cross section, and each channel connector being comprised of a flexible resilient material of a shape generally corre sponding to that of the channel members and having bottom, side and top walls enveloping the corresponding adjacent walls of the channel members, transverse abutment means, having opposed sides, emanating from the top walls at about the midpoint of the channel connector axial extent and a channel connector bottom wall having one or more apertures of a predetermined size whose axially outermost extents, relative to the abutment means, are equally axially spaced from the opposed sides of the abutment means and of a dimension so as to cooperate with protrusions in the bottom wall of the channel members so as to physically bias their end surfaces against the opposed sides of the abut ment means.
