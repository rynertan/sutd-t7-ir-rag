# Apparatus for coiling a moving web.

## Abstract
In order to coil a strip or web 13 onto a core 12, irrespec tive of the presence of a slot in the core, use is made of a small ribbon or chain 20 which is laid around part of the periphery of the core. The leading edge of the strip or web is fed into the nip formed by the core 12 and the ribbon or chain 20 so that it is forwarded around the core. After one convolution, the leading edge again is directed to the nip between the ribbon or chain 12 and the strip or web 13, so that the initiation of the coiling cycle has come to an end. After a few convolutions are wound on the core 12, the ribbon or chain 20 falls off the wound up strip or web 13.
