# Kickdown system for an infinitely variable transmission.

## Abstract
A kickdown system for an infinitely variable belt drive transmission comprises a primary pulley 24 having a hydrauli cally shiftable disc 24a , a secondary pulley 25 having a hy draulically shiftable disc 25a , a belt 26 engaged with both pulleys, and a hydraulic circuit having a pump 37 for supply ing oil. A transmission ratio control valve 44 is provided to be responsive to engine speed for controlling the oil and for shift ing the disc of the primary pulley to change the transmission ratio, and a pressure regulator valve 43 is provided to respond to the transmission ratio for increasing the pressure of the oil with increase of the transmission ratio. A kickdown switch 64 is provided to produce a signal in dependence on the full depression of an accelerator pedal 63 of a vehicle. A solenoid device 60 is responsive to the signal for operating the pres sure regulator valve so as to increase the pressure of the oil, whereby the downshifting of the transmission is enhanced.
