# Resin cutting apparatus.

## Abstract
A resin cutting apparatus for cutting a resin extruded from an extrusion opening 10 provided in a flat surface 8a of an extrusion block 2 . The apparatus comprises a rotating shaft 14 disposed substantially perpendicular to the surface of the extrusion block 2 with its front end positioned opposite to said surface 8a a drive mechanism for rotating the rotating shaft 14 and a cutting tool 18 interposed between the surface of the extrusion block 2 and the front end of the rotating shaft and having formed at its front surface facing the surface 8a of said extrusion block 2 at least one cutting blade 46 having a flat cutting edge. At least the front end portion of the rotating shaft 14 is urged elastically toward the surface of said extrusion block 2 by the action of an elastic member 34 , elastically abuts the rotating center on the back surface of the cutting tool 18 so that the cutting tool 18 can tilt in any desired direction with respect to the axis of rotation of the rotating shaft 14 , and thereby presses the cutting tool 18 against the surface of the extrusion block 2 . The rotating shaft 14 has mounted thereon at least one drive pin 40 which projects forward and comes into engagement with the cut ting tool 18 , and the rotation of the rotating shaft 14 is transmitted to the cutting tool 18 through the drive pin 40 .
