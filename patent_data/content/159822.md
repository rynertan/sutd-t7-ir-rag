# Inorganic filler and process for production thereof.

## Abstract
An inorganic filler composed of a modified montmorillonite group clay mineral and having an X ray diffraction pattern in herent to montmorillonite, an oil absorption of at least 100 ml 100 g and a Hunter whiteness of at least 80 . The modified clay mineral is produced by reacting a clay mineral of the montmorillonite group with 10 to 200 by weight based on the dry weight of the mineral, of an alkaline earth metal hydrox ide in the presence of water, and reacting the resulting product with a salt of a metal of Group IIb, III or IV of the periodic table containing an acid radical which gives a soluble alkaline earth metal salt upon reaction. The inorganic filler is especially suit able for use in lightweight paper.
