# Swing post hydraulic circuit.

## Abstract
An hydraulic system for actuating a swing post mounted backhoe boom 19 comprises two double acting hydraulic cylinders 17, 18 operated by a control valve 35 . As the backhoe boom 19 swings into a swing stop, hydraulic fluid is trapped in the head end 28 of the swing side cylinder. This trapped fluid is discharged through a cylinder relief valve 47 , thus absorbing the boom kinetic energy and providing a smooth deceleration of the boom. Fluid discharged from the relief valve 47 is routed to the rod end of the swing cylinder and the head end of the opposite cylinder. Because of the swing linkage geometry, the cylinder rod 30 of the other cylinder had passed over the pivot axis 16 about which the backhoe boom 19 was swinging and thus the piston 29 of the other cylinder was caused to move in the same direction as the swing side piston 29 . The movement of this piston can be utilized to provide additional deceleration torque as long as no void ing is permitted to occur in the head end of this other cylinder. Voiding only occurs when the backhoe swing con trol lever 38 is released prior to the backhoe boom reach ing the swing stop. Voiding does not occur when the con trol lever 38 is maintained in a full power on or is stroked in the power on mode until the swing stop is contacted. Fluid from the swing side cylinder relief valve is routed to provide the necessary fluid to prevent such voiding. The routing of the fluid from the swing cylinder to the other cylinder assures that the boom deceleration is independent of whether the control lever is stroked or released.
