# APPARATUS FOR LUBRICATING A MOVING CHAIN

## Abstract
An automatic lubricator 10 for chain conveyors 12 with a pivoting arm 24 having a roller 40 contacting the chain and moving between the chain side links 22 to place lubricating nozzles at 34 along the chain centre line. A magnetic proximity sensor 68 on the pivoting arm 24 activates the fluid pump 54 when the nozzles are in position to deliver lubricating fluid to the chain pins. Metering pump apparatus 54 diverts fluid from the metering pump to a fluid return line 104 immediately at the end of a lubrication cycle. The metering pump chamber is then primed for the next cycle. Drippage from the lubrication nozzles at 34 is eliminated.
