# Method for assessing cancerous malignancy or benignity and diagnostic pack for use therein.

## Abstract
The relative malignancy or benignity of a sample of cells suspected of being cancerous is determined by assaying intracellular constituents of the said cells to determine the rate of aerobic glycolysis as a function of the degree to which pyruvate kinase in the cells is inhibited by the presence of adenosine triphosphate. By this method an essentially quantitative assessement of the degree of malignancy or benignity may be made whithout the uncertainties which accompany histological assessement.

## Description
DESCRIPTION METHOD FOR ASSESSING CANCEROUS MALIGNANCY OR BENIGNITY AND DIAGNOSTIC PACK FOR USE IHEREIN This invention relates to the detection of cancerous diseases. The cancerous diseases, including both leukaemia and malignant neoplasias, rank third in the causes of human death. The progression of neoplasia in its invasiveness of healthy tissue depends mainly on the cell growth rate of the neoplastic cells.Although other factors such as tumour localisation, and the subject s general state of health and immunological resistance are relevant, the malignancy of a tumour or a leukaemia is principally dependent on, and is directly proportional to, the growth rate of its cells. Heretofore, the only generally accepted method of detecting tumour cell malignancy has been through observation of the morphology of the tumour cells. Undifferentiated cell morphology and abnormal nuclear apparatus are common in cells which, like the undifferentiated aizyonic cells1 exhibit a high growth rate or rate of multiplication.The histological or qualitative morphological method previously used for the diagnosis of tumour malignancy is not completely satisfactory, owing to its reliance on the visual perception by pathologists of ill defined morphological signs and the fact that, commonly, surgical, prognostic and other decisions are made on the basis of the inspection of only a few hundred milligrams of suspect material. Histological examination may be supplemented by, e.a., immunological matching between tumour and host, although even this corroborative evidence, whether or not accompanied by attention to clinical signs, can sometimes prove insufficient or even misleading.When it is recognised that many therapeutic, economic and social decisions in the case of cancer patients are based entirely on the diagnosis of a cancer s malignancy and the resulting prognosis, it will be appreciated that a need has arisen for a true, quantitative and precise method for assessing relative degrees of malignity or benignity based on determination of cell gt owtli rate. This need is especially significant in the case of tumours such as intestinal polyps and ovarian and mammary tumours which frequently exhibit great cellular growth rate, yet appear morphologically benign. In such cases, morphological evaluation alone may lead to fatal delays when surgical decisions must be made. Aerobic glycolysis the production of lactic acid from glucose in the presence of oxygen appears to be a unique metabolic characteristic of cancerous and embryonic cells. Biochemists generally agree that high aerobic glycolysis is associated with a high degree of biochemical undifferentiation, and it has been generally accepted that the rate of aerobic glycolysis in tumour cells closely correlates with cell growth rate. I have discovered that aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells is attributable to the failure of adenosine triphosphate ATP to inhibit the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase. In normal cells, in the presence of oxygen, ATP generated by the mitochondria essentially completely allosterically inhibits two enzymes in the metabolic pathway from glucose to lactic acid, i.e., phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase. Accordingly, in normal tissue no glycolysis occurs in the presence of oxygen. However, it now appears that in tumour cells ATP only partially inhibits phosphofructokinase, and that it inhibits pyruvate kinase either partially or not at all. Known methods may be applied to the determination of the extent to which enzymes in this metabolic pathway are inhibited by ATP.I have discovered a high degree of correlation between, e.g., the extent of ATP inhibition of pyruvate kinase in cancer cells and the Crabtree and Pasteur effects exhibited by these cells. Moreover, when the percentage inhibition by ATP of pyruvate kinase in cell samples under assay is compared with the malignancy or benignity of cancers in subjects from which the cells were drawn, as determined by morphological, biological and clinical study of the disease s evolution, a high degree of correlation emerges. Table I below compares the relative malignancy of cancers in subjects of various species with the percent ATP inhibition of pyruvate kinase in cancer cell homogenates derived from those subjects.

Gosalvez, et.al., Cancer Research 38, 142 148, 1978 . The present invention accordingly provides a method for assessing the cancerous malignancy or benignity of cells in a cell sample which comprises determining whether the activity of pyruvate kinase in the said cells is inhibited by the presence of adenosine triphosphate. As usually carried out this method involves a preparing from the said sample a homogenate containing pyruvate kinase from the said cells and b determining whether the action of the said pyruvate kinase on its substrate phosphoenol pyruvate is inhibited to any degree by the presence of adenosine triphosphate. In more detail, the theoretical basis of this new method is as follows. The step wise degradation of glucose to pyruvic acid, according to the well known Embden Myerhof pathway, includes the reaction EMI6.1 Phosphoenol Pyruvate pyruvate wherein ADP and ATP are, respectively, adenosine diphosphate and adenosine triphosphate. In healthy cells this reaction is suppressed by ATP inhibition of the enzyme pyruvate kinase. I have discovered, as previously noted, that in cancerous cells the reaction proceeds in greater or less degree, correlative to the degree of malignancy, in proportion to the extent to which ATP fails to inhibit pyruvate kinase activity. A preferred assay, therefore, involves assessment of the progress of the foregoing reaction in the presence of various levels of ATP calculated to reveal the extent, if any, by which sample derived pyruvate kinase activity is inhibited by ATP. The extent of such inhibition can be characterised on a percentage scale relative to the foregoing reaction, taking 0 as no inhibition, 100 as total inhibition, and maximum percent inhibition of pyruvate kinase activity as that point on the scale beyond which addition of further ATP essentially fails to affect further the progress of the reaction. Assay for the activity of sample derived pyruvate kinase may be commenced at any point prior to the phosphoenolpyruvate conversion on the EmbdenMeyerhof pathway as to which see, e.g., J. D. Watson, Molecular Bioloqy of the Gene, pp. 34 35, 3rd ed.1977 WA. Benjamin, Inc., publ., Menlo Park, Ca. , provided any necessary substrates, co factors, enzymes and co enzymes are supplied to the assay medium. As used herein, the term pyruvate kinase assay medium means a solution containing the active ingredients necessary for activity assay, other than subsequently added ATP . Preferably, however, the phosphoenolpyruvate reaction is directly monitored by supplying phosphoenolpyruvate and ADP to the samplederived pyruvate kinase, and following the resulting reaction, preferably spectrophotometrically, in the presence of varying amounts of ATP. It is especially convenient therefore to supply the user of the new method with a diagnostic pack in accordance with the invention which comprises a a medium for pyruvate kinase activity assay and b adenosine triphosphate. An especially preferred method of following the reaction spectrophotometrically involves compound optical assay, in which the influence of the reaction under study on a secondary reaction with an observable end product is followed. See Felu, FEBS Letters 50, 334 1975 and Bucher, T. et al., in Methods inEnzymology, Vol. I S.P. Colowick and N.O. Kaplan, eds. Academic Press, N.Y. p. 435.Thus, in the compound reaction EMI8.1 tb excess tb phosphoenol SEP Pyrllvate SEP Kinase tb pyruvate SEP SEP ADP SEP SEP SEP SEP ATP tb SEP Mg SEP and SEP K SEP or SEP NH4 SEP K tb SEP Lactic SEP Dehydrogenase tb NADH SEP SEP H SEP in SEP excess, SEP added SEP prior SEP lactate SEP tb SEP in SEP excess, SEP added SEP prior SEP NAD tb SEP to SEP pyruvate SEP kinase tb pyruvate kinase activity can be monitored by observing the rate of disappearance of the band at 340 m of the hydrogen donor NADH nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, reduced form . Successive repetitions of the assay with differing amounts of added ATP establish the point beyond which ATP addition fails to influence the rate of disappearance of the hydrogen donor.Thus, for example, a graphical comparison of the decrease in absorbance in the absence of ATP and at various concentrations of ATP, shows the maximum point of allosteric inhibition at the point of inflexion of the graph. Samples for assay may be obtained as whole tissue e.g., of volume 1 10 mm3 in the case of suspected tumours, by intraoperatorybiopsy or needle biopsy. In the case of suspected blood malignancies, the collection of white blood cells by differential centrifugation is sufficient. Samples are preserved on ice pending the preparation of homogenates suitable for assay. Homogenisation frees cell contained pyruvate kinase for assay and involves cell disruption by conventional techniques which avoid, to a useful degree, the destruction of nuclei, mitochondria and other cell particulates. Typically, the sample may be placed in a hand homogeniser which is supplied with the assay kit, in buffered isotonic solution, and homogenised with several strokes of a pestle.From, e.g., 0.1 to 1 ml of buffered solution, depending on the size of the sample, is preferably employed.As one of many appropriate buffers may be mentioned a solution comprising 50 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.0, 0.1 mM EDTA and 0.5 mM dithioerythritol. In the preferred embodiment of the invention the homogenate is next centrifuged, for example at about 5,000 10,000 rpm in a conical centrifuge tube for 10 minutes, and the supernatant is dialysed against water e.g., for 2 hours at about 2 4 C. . The contents of the dialysis bag are then transferred to a tube immersed in ice. In the case of large samples, the centrifugation and dialysis steps may be omitted, as will be appreciated by the art skilled. Preferably, however, a dialysis bag is supplied with the kit. As used herein, the term homogenate refers to a free enzyme containing product of homogenisation, whether or not accompanied by other cellular debris. In the most preferred embodiment of the invention, the kit or diagnostic pack includes pyruvate kinase assay medium which, when diluted 5 to 10 times with distilled water, has the composition 50 mMImidazole HC1, pH 7.0, 0.1 M KC1, 5 mM MgC12, 0.15 mM NADH, 1 mM Mg ADP, 2 mM phosphoenolpyruvate and 1 unit per ml of lactic dehydrogenase. A small sample of homogenate is added to, e.g., 3 ml of assay medium in a cuvette, to which ATP is also added from a third stock solution for NADH absorbance determinations at 340 mu. In successive determinations, the differentATP concentrations initially in the assay medium may be, e.g., 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 mM. A plot of decrease in absorbance against ATP concentration, shows the maximum percentage inhibition of pyruvate kinase by ATP. Alternatively, as those skilled in the art will appreciate from the foregoing, a yes no result may be determined by comparing pyruvate kinase inhibition at a particular, optimal ATP concentration to values previously determined at that concentration with samples, of known malignancy, of each different type of cancer under assay. In its broadest aspect, my invention is based on the recognition that the susceptibility of cellderived pyruvate kinase to ATP inhibition is correlated to the relative cell growth rate and degree of undifferentiation, and hence malignancy, of cells from which the enzyme is derived. The invention accordingly affords a quantitative biochemical method for the diagnosis and prognosis of cancerous diseases.
