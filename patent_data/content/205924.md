# MONITORING SYSTEM FOR DETECTING QUENCH OF SUPERCONDUCTIVE COILS

## Abstract
In a monitoring system for detecting a quench in a superconductive coil 1 to which AC power is supplied, a switch apparatus 5 is connected between the coil 1 and a A.C. power source 7 . A voltage between a top of the coil 1 and a dividing resistor 8 connected in parallel with the coil 1 is detected and converted into a voltage signal by a insulation amplifier 10 and a current flowing through the coil 1 is detected by a current detector 12 and is convert ed into a current signal by an amplifier 13 . The voltage signal is detected with the current signal as a reference signal by a phase detector 14 so that a signal component of the voltage signal in phase with the reference signal is outputted from the phase detector. The signal component is averaged in a averaging circuit 15 , when the voltage signal is out of phased with the reference signal, an output signal is generated as a alarm signal from the averaging circuit 15 .
