# APPARATUS AND PROCESS FOR ULTRASONICALLY CUTTING OFF PREDETERMINED WIDTHS OF SELVAGES AND SEALING THE CUT EDGES OF TEXTILE FABRIC

## Abstract
Apparatus and process for ultrasonically cutting off undesir able selvage S and sealing the longitudinal cut edges E from both sides of continuous lengths of textile fabric F having at least some thermoplastic yarns therein. The apparatus and process are characterized by cutting off a predetermined width of the undesirable selvage S from each side of the textile fabric F regardless of the transverse variations in the path of travel of the fabric F through the apparatus or width of the fabric F . The apparatus utilizes a mechanism 26 for shifting the moving textile fabric F relative to a stationary ultrasonic cutting and sealing mechanism 20 on one longitudinal edge of the fabric F and a mechanism 50 for shifting a movable ultrasonic cutting and edge sealing mechanism 40 relative to the other longitudinal edge of the moving textile fabric F .
