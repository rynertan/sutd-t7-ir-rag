# COMPUTER BASED INTERLOCKING SYSTEM

## Abstract
An interlocking system comprising a plurality, e.g., three, of parallel sub systems A, B, C operating asynchronously to produce identical replicated outputs which are mutually com pared to determine the correct output and disqualifying a mi nority output thereby ensuring high system integrity. Each sub system includes a similar arrangement 9a, 9b, 9c for computing the difference L M, M R, L R between all possible pairs of sub systems. Comparison of these results with a reference table of all possible dlfference results and then comparison of the difference equations yields a common factor which is the sub system producing the error. Action can then be taken to disqualify its output, e.g., by switching off its power supply. A final output 11 is taken, preferably from one sub sys tem A , with a second 11 as standby. To accommodate asynchronous running, a final output 11 is only acted upon if it is repeated in a succeeding output cycle thus permitting op portunity to disqualify the preferred output A if it is judged in error by the other sub systems and to replace it by the standby B .
