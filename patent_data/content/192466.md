## Description
NOVEL CHALCOGEN HETEROCYCLES, PROCESSES FOR THEIR PREPARATION, AND ARTICLES CONTAINING SUCH HETEROCYCLES This invention is directed to heterocycles containing nitrogen and tellurium atoms in a common ring. It relates especially to compounds containing three fused rings, including two fused rings containing tellurium and nitrogen and a third fused carbocyclic aromatic ring. The invention is also directed to a process for preparing and articles incorporating these heterocycles. Aromatic chalcogenazolium salts, such as benzoxazol ium, naphthoxazol lum, benzothiazol ium, naphthothiazolium, benzoselenazolium, and naphthoselenazolium salts, as well as their azole, azoline, and azolinium derivatives, have been widely employed in silver halide photography. These compounds have been employed as nuclei in antifoggants or stabilizers, nucleating agents, latent image keeping addenda, and speed or contrast increasing addenda for silver halide photographic systems. Aromatic chalcogenazolium salts are commonly incorporated as nuclei of polymethine dyes. A well known method For the synthesis of carbocyanine dyes employs 2 2 acetanllidovinyl substituted aromatic chalcogenazolium salts as intermediates, the latter being formed by reacting an N,N diarylformamidine with an aromatic chalcogenazolium salt substituted at its 2 ring position with a methine precursor, such as a methyl group, followed by treatment with a base and acetylation, either sequentially or concurrently.Carbocyanine dye synthesis can be completed by reacting the 2 2 acetanilldovinyl substituted aromatic chalcogenazolium salt with another azine or azole heterocycle also ring substituted with a methine group precursor, such as a methyl substituted azole or 2 or 4 methyl substituted azine. Such carbocyanine dyes syntheses are illustrated by T. H.James, The Theory of the PhotoRraPhic Process, 4thEd., Macmillan, 1977, pp. 205 212, and by F. M. Hamer, Cyanine DYes and Related Compounds, John Wiley and Sons, 1964, pp. 105, 106, and 117 120. Although U.S. Patents 2,168,174 2,323,503 and 2,323,504 have extended generic ring formulae to include tellurazoles as extrapolations of investigations of other chalcogenazoles, the true state of the art is summed up by U.S. Patent 2,339,094 It may be observed that the difficulty of reaction resulting in the production of azoles containing members of the oxygen group of elements in the azole ring may vary greatly with different elements, becoming greater in proceed ing from the non metallic elements such as oxygen and sulfur to the more strongly metallic elements such as selenium and tellurium.This probably accounts for the fact that many of the oxazoles and thiazoles have been known for years while the preparation of most of the selenazoles has been accomplished more recently and some of them are still unknown although the corresponding oxazoles and thiazoles are known. Furthermore, the tellurazoles from the simplest to the more complex derivatives have not been described up to the present time. While the art has heretofore been unsuccessful in preparing tellurazolium salts and their derivatives, it should be noted that divalent tellurium atoms have been placed in other ring structures. Benzisotellurazole l,2 is described in Un Nouvel Heterocycle Tellure le Benzisotellur azole l,2 , by Campsteyn et al, Journal of Hetero cyclic Chemistry, Vol. 15, August 1978, pp. 745 748.Unfdrtunately no derivative of benzisotellurazole l,2 is disclosed. Tellurium atoms have been incorporated in ring structures other than azole or azine rings of various dyes. Japanese Kokai 136420, laid openNovember 25, 1976, discloses a 1 tellura 3,5 cyclo hexanedione nucleus in a merocyanine sensitizing dye in a silver halide emulsion. U.S. Patent 4,329,284 discloses 1,2 oxachalcogenol l ium salts, wherein the chalcogen can be tellurium or selenium, to be useful in photoconductive compositions. U.S. Patents 4,365,016 and 017 disclose tellurapyrylium dyes for use in photoconductive compositions. In published European Patent Applications 0,136,847 and 0,137,600 there are disclosed compounds containing an aromatic ring portion fused with a tellurazolium or derivative tellurazole, tellurazoline including tellurazolinylidene , or telluraz linium ring portion together with processes and intermediates for their preparation. It is an object of this invention to provide a novel class of isotellurazole compounds. It is another object to provide a method for preparing these compounds. It is still another object to provide a novel filter material. It is a further object to provide a novel filter element. It is a still further object to provide a novel photographic element. One object of this invention is achieved by providing a l arylisotellurazolo l,5 a tellurazole having an aromatic group fused thereto at the 5,6 position. Another object of this invention is achieved by providing a process of preparing a l aryliso tellurazolo l,5 a aromatic tellurazole by preparing an aromatic tellurazolium heterocycle substituted at its 2 ring position with a methine group precursor and reacting the heterocycle with a diarylformamidine in the presence of a solvent. Still another object of this invention is achieved by providing a material for filtering blue light comprised of a binder and a l arylisotellurazolo l,5 a aromatic tellurazole. A further object of this invention is achieved by providing a filter for blue light comprised of a layer of this material. Still a further object of this invention is achieved by providing a photographic element comprised of a support and, coated on said support, a layer comprised of a l arylisotellurazolo 1,5 a aromatic tellurazole. To prepare a l arylisotellurazolo 1,5 a aromatic tellurazole according to the present invention it is first necessary to prepare an aromatic tellurazolium salt which is substituted at its 2 ring position with a methine group precursor, such as methyl group. One such salt is a tellurium salt, such as illustrated by formula I EMI4.1 wherein G represents the atoms completing a substituted or unsubstituted fused aromatic nucleus L represents a methine group precursor M represents a charge balancing counter ion m is 0 or 1 and R is hydrogen or a substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbon group. It is by some procedures most convenient to prepare a tellurazolium salt according to formula I in the form in which R is hydrogen, hereinafter referred to as a protonated tellurazolium salt. The protonated tellurazolium salt can be deprotonated by treatment with a base to form the corresponding tellurazole. A quaternizing agent can be employed to convert the tellurazole to the corresponding tellurazolium salt containing a substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbon group as the quaternizing substituent. A first process for preparing a protonated tellurazolium salt satisfying formula I described above employs a starting material satisfying formula it . EMI5.1 wherein G represents the atoms completing a substituted or unsubstituted fused aromatic nucleus, x is zero or 1 X is halogen or pseudohalogen Z is O or N R and R is an aromatic nucleus. When x is zero and Z is N R , the starting material can be 2 phenylazophenyl C,N tellurium II chloride, the preparation of which is described by Cobbledick et al, Some New Organotellurium Compounds Derived from Azobenzene TheCrystal and Molecular Structure of 2 Phenylazo phenyl C,N tellurium II Chloride , Journal ofChemical Research, pp. 1901 1924, 1979.AlthoughCobbledick et al employed chloride as the halogen corresponding to X in formula II , it is apparent from the reported synthesis that X can be halogen employed here and elsewhere to designate generically chloride, bromide, or iodide or a pseudohalogen i.e., one of the recognized class of substituents known to approximate the substituent properties of halogen , such as a cyano, thiocyanate, or hydroxy substituent. Similarly, G and R can be varied merely by substituting for one or both of the phenyl groups employed in the phenylazophenyl employed byCobbledick et al an alternative aromatic nucleus.In general the aromatic nuclei, which form G in each of its various occurrences and are referred to in other occurrences variously as aromatic rings, nuclei, or aryl groups or moieties, are preferably carbocyclic aromatic nuclei having from 6 to 20 carbon atoms, most preferably a phenyl or naphthyl or, in the fused form, a benzo or naphtho, nucleus.In some instances an aromatic nucleus can be fused through a fivemembered ring, as is illustrated by acenaphthylene fused at its 1,2 ring edge. Since R has little influence on the reaction and is not incorporated in the final product, R can take a particularly wide variety of aromatic forms, but is generally most conveniently chosen from among the preferred forms of carbocyclic aromatic nuclei. In an alternative form the first process can employ a starting material according to formula II in which x is zero and Z is oxygen. This compound can be formed by placing in solution a substituted or unsubstituted a tetralone, hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid, tellurium dioxide, and hydroxylamine.This reaction has the advantage that all of the required materials are readily available at relatively low cost. Alcohols are convenient solvents for the reaction, although other nonreactive organic solvents can be employed. Heating is not required, but can accelerate the reaction. The material of formula II forms a solid phase which can be separated by routinç flltering and washing steps.Both unsubstituted a tetralone and various substituted derivatives are useful. Preferred a tetralones can be represented by the formula EMI7.1 wherein R2 and Ra are independently selected from among hydrogen, halogen, alkyl, and alkoxy. SinceR2 and Ra are naphtho ring substituents in the tellurazolium salt ultimately produced, it is apparent that the number of carbon atoms in the alkyl and alkoxy substituents can be widely varied.Instead of employing an a tetralone, as described above, it is possible to employ a substituted or unsubstituted acenaphthen l one. In general alkyl substituents and moieties of the tellurazolium salts and their derivatives are limited only by physical considerations, such as solubility, mobility, and molecular bulk. Generally alkyl and other aliphatic moieties of the tellurazolium salts and their derivatives of this invention are contemplated to contain up to 18 or more carbon atoms. Since increasing molecular bulk, except as sometimes required to reduce mobility, is seldom desirable in photographic applications, the preferred aliphatic hydrocarbon moieties contain up to 6 carbon atoms, with the lower alkyls i.e., methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl being preferred. In general, references to cycloalkyl indicate groups having 4 to 10 carbon atoms in a ring, with 5 or 6 ring carbon atoms being preferred. Instead of preparing the starting material of formula 11 wherein x is zero and Z is oxygen in the manner described above, an oxime of an a tetralone or acenaphthen l one described above can be reacted with tellurium tetrahalide, preferably tellurium tetrachloride or tellurium tetrabromide.In this and subsequent descriptions of employing tellurium tetrahalides as reactants it should be borne in mind that similar results can usually be obtained by reacting, before or during the a tetralone or acenaphthen l one or reaction, a soluble halide salt, such as an alkali or alkaline earth halide, with tellurium dioxide. This is believed to generate a tellurium tetrahalide. A carboxylic acid can be employed as a solvent for the reaction, and the reaction can be accelerated by heating. The starting material of formula 11 forms a solid phase which can be separated by routine filtering and washing procedures. The preferred a tetralone oximes correspond to the preferred a tetralones and can be represented by the formula EMI8.1 wherein R2 and R, are chosen as described above. In a third general form of the starting material of formula II x can be 1 and Z oxygen.This form of the stating material of formula II can be prepared by reacting with tellurium tetrahalide a carbocyclic aromatic compound activated for electrophilic substitution. Although naphthalene is illustrative of a fused ring carbocyclic aromatic compound that has been activated for electrophilic substitution, it is generally easiest to activate benzene. Activation can be achieved by employing Uu electron donating substituents, such as hydroxy, hydroxyalkyl, alkyl, alkoxy, aryloxy, hydroxyaryl, amino, and groups of similar negative Hammett sigma values, singly or in combination. The reaction can be carrried out in an organic solvent such as a liquid hydrocarbon e.g., benzene or cyclohexane , a halohydrocarbon e.g., chlorobenzene or chloroform , a nitrohydrocarbon e.g., nitromethane , or acetonitrile while heating to reflux.Formation of the starting material of formula II can be completed by nitrating and then treating with a reducing agent.Strong reducing agents can be employed in precisely stoichiometric concentrations or less. It is generally preferred to employ a mild or dilute reducing agent. Nitric acid in a suitable diluent, such as water or carboxylic acid, can be used for nitrating while hypophosphorous acid can be employed as the mild reducing agent. The synthetic route described above can be modified by a preliminary treatment with the mild reducing agent before nitrating and employing a strong nonoxidizing acid after nitrating and before employing the mild reducing agent a second time. In general the strong nonoxidizing acids contemplated for use in this and other steps of the preparation procedures herein described include acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, fluoroboric acid, a sulfonic acid, and phosphoric acid. A particularly preferred starting material prepared by the process described in the preceding paragraph can be represented by the formula EMI9.1 wherein at least one of R1 and R2 and preferably both are chosen from among hydroxy, hydroxyalkyl, alkyl, alkoxy, aryloxy, hydroxyaryl, and amino groups. Alternately R1 and R2 together can form an alkanediyldioxy linkage e.g., a O CH n linkage, where n is preferably from 1 to 3. X is halogen or pseudohalogen, as previously described. Once the starting material of formula II has been prepared, regardless of the choice of alternative preparation routes described above, it is treated with a strong alkaline reducing agent, such as an alkali borohydride e.g., lithium, sodium, or potassium borohydride . The reaction product is then acylated with a compound according to formula VI . EMI10.1 wherein L represents a methine group precursor and Y is halogen or L C O O .From the values of Y, it is apparent that the acylating agent can be either acyl halide, such as acetyl chloride or acetyl bromide, or an acid anhydride, such as acetic anhydride. By noting the appearance of L in formulas I and VI it is also apparent that the acyl halide or acid anhydride also provides the 2 position substituent in the protonated tellurazolium salt. The L group serves the important purpose of providing a methine group forming the isotellurazole ring in the heterocycle ultimately produced. Generally this function is adequately served when L is a methyl group, but L can take the form of any methine group precursor desired.Producing the protonated tellurazolium salt is completed by treatment with a strong nonoxidizing acid, such as any of those mentioned above. Another process for preparing a protonated tellurazolium alt Åaccording to formula I comprises employing a starting material according to formula VII EMI11.1 wherein G represents the atoms completing a substituted or unsubstituted fused aromatic nucleus L represents a methine group precursor and X represents halogen or pseudohalogen.In formula VII the halogen or pseudohalogen represented by X and the methine precursor group represented by L can take any of the forms previously described. The starting material is reacted with a strong alkaline reducing agent, such as described above, and the resulting product is reacted with a strong nonoxidizing acid, such as also described above, to produce the desired protonated tellurazolium salt. The starting material of formula VII can be prepared starting with a compound according to formula VIII EMI11.2 wherein H is an activated hydrogen atom G represents the atoms completing a substituted or unsubstitutedaromatic nucleus and L is a methine group precursor. When the compound of formula VI is melted or heated in a suitable solvent e.g., acetonitrile, butyronitrile, or chloroform with tellurium tetrachloride or tellurium tetrabromide, the material of formula VIII is produced. Heating to a temperature of at least 60 C up to about 1400C is contemplated, with temperatures of from about 110 to 1200C being preferred. If desired, the chloride or bromide in the formula VII compound can be displaced by iodide or pseudohalogen by treatment with iodide or pseudohalogen salt, thereby permitting the full range of values of X in formula VII to be realized. In part the reaction to produce the material of formula VII is accomplished by choosing G in formula VIII so that the aromatic nucleus which it completes is activated in the position ortho to the amido substituent.This can be accomplished by including in the aromatic nucleus one or more substituents capable of directing ring substitution in formula VI to the ring position of the stsrred activated hydrogen atom. For carbocyclic aromatic rings, such as benzene and naphthene rings, useful substituents can be chosen from among aliphatic and aromatic groups comprised of hydrocarbon moieties e.g., alkyl, aryl, alkaryl, or alkaryl optionally linked through a divalent oxygen or sulfur atom e.g., an alkoxy, aryloxy, alkaryloxy, alkaryloxy, alkylthio, arylthio, alkarylthio, or alkarylthio group an amino group, including primary, secondary and tertiary amines an amido group e.g., acetamido and butyramido a sulfonamido group e.g. an alkyl or arylsulfonamido group a sulfamoyl group e.g. an alkyl or arylsulfamoyl group a ureido group e.g., l ureido, 3 phenyl l ureido, and 3 methyl l ureido hydroxy or a C O M group or S O 2M group, wherein M is chosen to complete an acid, ester, thioester, or salt e.g., c O OH, C O SCH , C O OCH , C O ONa, S O OH, S O 2OCH2C6H5, or S O 2OLi . 2 2 6 5 2The aromatic nucleus completed by G as well as L can progress unaltered from the compound of formula VIII to the protonated tellurazolium salt. In formula I , when R is hydrogen, m is 1 and M is an anion, and is usually the anion of the last acid employed in the process. However, it is apparent that conversion from one anion to another can be easily accomplished and that the anion of the protonated tellurazolium saltscan be varied widely. To obtain the tellurazole corresponding to the protonated tellurazolium salt prepared as described above treatment with a base, such as ammonium hydroxide, an alkali hydroxide, or an alkali carbonate or bicarbonate, can be undertaken.Procedures for performing the same operation on known chalcogenazolium salts are directly applicable. The tellurazole product obtained is generally indicated by formula IX EMI13.1 wherein G and L correspond to their values in the parent protonated tellurazolium salt. To convert the tellurazole of formula IX to a corresponding quaternized heterocyclic ammonium salt, the tellurazole is reacted with a quaternizing agent. Specifically preferred quaternizing agents are strong quaternizing agents, such as poly fluoro alkylsulfonic acid esters, such as aryl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aralkyl, or alkaryl esters of poly fluoro alkylsulfonic acid. Perfluorinated alkylsulfonic acid esters are particularly preferred quaternizing agents e.g., trifluoromethylsulfonic acid esters . Arylsulfonic acid esters, such as para toluenesulfonic acid esters, are also strong quaternizing agents. 1,3,2 Dioxathiane 2,2 dioxide and 1,3,2 di oxathiolane 2,2 dioxide have also been demonstrated to be useful quaternizing agents. Including electron donating ring substituents in the aromatic nuclei forming G in formula IX facilitates quaternization while strongly electron withdrawing substituents require strong quaternizing agents to be employed when quaternization occurs after tellurazole ring formation. A very advantageous approach for preparing quaternized tellurazolium salts satisfying formula I is to employ a starting material according to formula II wherein x is zero. The starting material is first treated with a strong alkaline reducing agent, which can be selected from among those described above. The reaction product is then treated with an oxidizing agent, such as oxygen, a peroxide, a disulfide, or a sulfoxide, to produceEMI14.1 which is treated with an aldehyde, treated with a strong alkaline reducing agent, such as described above, and then treated with an acylating agent according to formula VI , as described above, and a strong nonoxidizing acid, also as described above. Although treatment with an oxidizing agent is preferred, no separate oxidizing step is required.Ambient air will spontaneously perform such oxidation, and treatment with the aldehyde is sufficient in an inert atmosphere. A variety of quaternizing substituents can be introduced in the salt of formula I in addition to those provided by strong quaternizing agents, merely by appropriate selection of the aldehyde. Thus, in addition to hydrogen R in formula I can take the form of a substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbon residue of an aldehyde quaternizing substituent, such as alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, or aralkyl moieties as well as substituted derivatives, such as oxy, thio, ssulfo, sulfonyl, sulfato, halo, or carboxy substituted derivatives, often incorporated to modify solubility or other physical properties. Sulfoalkyl and sulfatoalkyl quaternizing substituents having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms are specifically preferred. Once an aromatic tellurazolium salt is obtained a l arylisotellurazolo l,5 a aromatic tellurazole according to this invention can be prepared by reacting the l arylisotellurazolorl,5 a aromatic tellurazole with an N,N diarylformamidine in the presence of a solvent. Useful N,N diarylformamidines can be illustrated by formula XI Arl NH L2 N Arz XI wherein Ari and Ar2 are aromatic groups and L2 is a methine group.The aromatic groups Ari and Ar2 are preferably carbocyclic aromatic groups, such as phenyl or naphthyl. The aromatic groups can be substituted, if desired. Such optional aromatic group substituents can be similar to the optional hydrocarbon group substituents described above in connection with R.The methine group is preferably CH , but the hydrogen can be replaced with a hydrocarbon group, if desired. For example, lower alkyl groups of from 1 to 6 carbon atoms are common pendant groups. WhenAri and Ar2 are each phenyl and L2 is CH , theN,N diarylformamidine of formula XI is N,N di phenylformamidine, a preferred reactant. As discussed above, when an aromatic chalcogenazole, differing from formula I in that an oxygen, sulfur, or selenium chalcogen atom is present in place of tellurium, is reacted with formamidine, the corresponding 2 2 acetanilidovinyl substituted compound is produced, which is a common intermediate in the preparation of cyanine and merocyanine dyes.Such reactions are performed using a variety of common organic solvents, such as alkanols e.g., methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, n butanol, tert butanol, and the like acetonitrile aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, such as toluene, xylene, and decane, as well as their halogenated analogues high boiling ethers pyridine dimethylsulfoxide and dimethylformamide. However, when an aromatic tellurazolium salt such as indicated by formula I is reacted with an N,N diarylformamidine in the types of solvents commonly employed to produce 2 2 acetanilidovinyl substituted aromatic chalcogenazoles, it is has been observed that the result is is not a 2 2 acetanilidovinyl aromatic tellurazolium salt, but a l arylisotellurazolo l,5 a aromatic tellurazole, a novel heterocycle. Further, it is a heterocycle that has no known oxygen, sulfur, or selenium analogue.That is, no other isochalcogenazolo l,5 a aromatic chalcogenazole is known. Formation of the l arylisotellurazolo 1,5 a aromatic tellurazole occurs under the same conditions known to produce 2 2 acetanilidovinyl aromatic chalcogenazolium salts, such as 2 2 acetanilidovinyl benzoxazolium, 2 2 acetanilidovJnyl benzo thiazolium, and 2 2 acetanllidovinyl8henzoselen azolium salts. The reaction generally takes place at room temperature, but can be accelerated tsf heating, if desired. If, instead of placing in 8 olvent, an aromatic tellurazolium salt such as indicated by formula I is melted with an N,N diarylformamidine and held at an elevated temperture, 2 2 acetanilidovinyl aromatic tellurazolium salt can be produced. The preferred l arylisotellurazolo 1 5 a aromatic tellurazoles according to this invention can be represented by formula XII EMI17.1 wherein Ari is an aromatic group G represents the atoms completing a substituted or unsubstituted fused aromatic nucleus L1 and L2 are methine groups and R is hydrogen or a substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbon group. Preferred selections of Ari, G, L1, L2, and R have been previously identified and discussed in connection with the starting materials, wherein corresponding moieties are representedby corresponding formula symbols. Specifically preferred l arylisotellur azolo l,5 a aromatic tellurazoles according to this invention are l phenylisotellurazolo l ,5 ajbenzo tellurazoles, such as those represented by formula EMI18.1 wherein R is comprised of a hydrocarbon group selected from among alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl, aralkyl, or alkaryl groups substituted or unsubstituted, e.g. with one or more oxy, thio, sulfonyl, sulfato, halo, or carboxy groups R1 and R2 are individually chosen from among hydrogen, hydroxy, hydroxyalkyl, alkyl, alkoxy, alkylthio, aryloxy, arylthio, hydroxyaryl, and amino groups or R1 and R2 together form an alkanediyl dioxy linkage e.g., a O CH2 n O n 0 linkage, where n is preferably 1 to 3 and represents a phenyl substituent. The isotellurazolo l,5 a tellurazole nucleus forms a blue absorbing chromophore. Thus, in the absence of other substituent chromophores, the 1 arylisotellurazolo l ,5 a aromatic tellurazoles according to the present invention are bright yellow in appearance. The color and stability of the isotellurazolol,5 atellurazole nucleus allows the heterocycles of this invention to be employed to filter blue light. The l arylisotellurazolo l,5 a aromatic tellurazoles can be employed in either a solid crystalline or liqutd form to filter blue light. Fabrication of filter layers, either as discrete elements or as components of elements, can be generally facilitated by dispersing the l aryliso tellurazolo l,5 a aromatic tellurazoles in a binder or other dispersing vehicle. In addition to their use in filtering blue light the l arylisotellurazolo l ,5 a aromatic tellurazoles according to the present invention can be employed as alternatives to stable heterocyclic nuclei incorporated in a variety of compounds. Such nuclei are, for example, often employed to reduce mobility eig., as ballasts. Still other functions are possible. The utility of l aryllsotellurazolo 1,5 a aromatic tellurazoles according to the present invention can be conveniently illustrated by reference to silver halide photography. In its most widely employed form silver halide photography employs for imaging radiation sensitive silver halide grains. The grains are suspended in a dispersing medium so that the grains and dispersing medium together form a radiation sensitive silver halide emulsion. The silver halide emulsions are typically coated on at photographic film or paper support to form a photographic element. A simple photographic element can consist of a support and an emulsion layer however, typically additional layers, such as multiple emulsion layers, subbing layers, interlayers, and overcoats are also present.The silver halide emulsions can be usefully, though incompletely, categorized as those which form predominantly surface or predominantly internal latent images upon exposure. Photographic elements can be conveniently classified as being direct positive photographic elements or negative working photographic elements.Whether a positive or negative viewable image is produced is a function of both the emulsion chosen and the photographic processing undertaken. Although light processing is known and employed for rpecial ized applications, in most instances photographic processing to produce a viewable image is accom plished by development of an imagewise exposed photographic element in an aqueous alkaline processing solution. Usually internal latent image forming emulsions are employed in combination with uniform light exposure or, preferably a nucleating agent, to produce direct positive images. Direct positive images can be produced also by employing initially surface fogged silver halide grains which rely on s elective development of unexposed grains to produce direct positive images.Internal latent image emulsions can be used to produce negative images by internal development that is, developing in the presence of iodide ion or a silver halide solvent capable of rendering the internal latent image site accessible to the developing agent. Aside from solarization effects, surface latent image emulsions cannot produce direct positive images, but are extensively used to produce positive color images by reversal processing. Of extreme importance to obtaining commercially attractive photographic images are a large variety of emulsion, photographic element, and processing solution addenda.A succinct summary of radiation sensitive silver halide emulsions, photographic elements, processing solutions, their basic and modifying components, and significant patents and publications describing their features is contained in Research Disclosure, Vol. 176, December 1978, Item 17643. Research Disclosure is published by Kenneth Mason Publications, Ltd., 8 North Street,Emsworth, Hampshire P010 7DD, England. The l arylisotellurazolo l ,5 a aromatic tellurazoles of this invention when employed as filter materials can be substituted for conventional filter materials incorporated in silver halide photographic elements. Such materials and their uses are described in Research Disclosure, Item 17643, cited above, Item VIII. To illustrate one such spplication, it is common in multicolor photographic elements to protect the silver halide emulsion layers intended to record green and red exposures from exposure to blue light by locating a blue absorbing filter layer, often referred to as a yellow filter layer, between the green and red recording emulsion layers and a source of exposing radiation. Typically the green and red recording emulsion layers lie between the blue absorbing filter layer and the photographic support.The l arylisotellurazolo 11,5 a aromatic tellurazoles of this invention dispersed in a conventional vehicle, typically a hydrophilic colloid, such as gelatin, can achieve blue absorption in such layers. In addition to use as filter materials the l arylisotellurazolo 1,5 a aromatic tellurazoles of this invention can be substituted for heterocyclic nuclei in photographic addenda incorporated in emulsion and other layers of silver halide photographic elements. Conventional photographic addenda including stable heterocyclic nuclei include dyes, antifoggants and stabilizers, and nucleating agents, each illustrated by Research Disclosure, Item 17643, cited above.Examples The invention can be better appreciated by reference to the following specific examples.Preparations of compounds which are taught from prior publications are labelled preparations while preparations of compounds employed in the process of this invention to produce l arylisotellurazolotl,5 a aromatic tellurazoles not taught by prior publications are designated examples. A. Preparation of 2 Phenvlazophenyltellurium Trichloride EMI22.1 C H C1 N Te mw 415.18 12 9 3 2 A two liter, 3 necked flask was fitted with mechanical stirrer teflons blade , reflux condenser and nitrogen inlet. A gas outlet from the top of the condenser was connected to a gas bubbler dipping into a magnetically stirred 1000 ml beaker containing 200 ml distilled water and a little phenolphthalein indicator. The system was sufficiently gas tight so that a very gentle stream of nitrogen produced consistent bubbles in the indicator solution.

The mass became difficult to stir. Eventually, the reaction mixture became more liquid, though the orange color kept returning after each portion was added, as the rather insoluble starting material underwent the first reduction step. The reaction mixture was kept overnight under an atmosphere of nitrogen.
