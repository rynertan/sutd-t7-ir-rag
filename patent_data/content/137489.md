## Description
This invention relates to the preparation of a laminate using a polyisocyanurate foam as a core material. The foam is produced from an organic polyisocyanate and a polyol blend comprising a an alkylene oxide adduct of an aromatic amine capped with primary hydroxyl groups, and b an aromatic polyester polyol. Polyisocyanurate foams are well known and are described, for example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,799,896 and 3,940,517 and in U.K. Patent No. 1,155,768. In the U.S. Patent No. 4,092,276 is disclosed the use of alkali metal salts of organic phosphinic acids as trimerization catalysts for iscocyanate groups. This offers a latent catalytic effect even when using very reactive polyols, i.e. primary hydroxyl terminated polyols in the foam formulation. It is also known to employ polyisocyanurate foams as the core of laminated foam board stock material which can be prepared with a variety of different facer materials, as described, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 3,940,517, supra. Unfortunately, the adhesion of the facer material to the foam core has not been as great as desired. Poor facing sheet adhesion can result in delamination. The present invention concerns an improved polyisocyanurate foam having a combination of advantageous properties, including a reduced friability and high thermal stability and compressive strength, and a method of producing the foam. The present invention also is directed to the production of a polyisocyanurate foam which has improved facing sheet adhesion without adversely affecting the other physical and chemical properties of the foam. The present invention also concerns the formation of an improved laminate having a facing sheet which adheres tenaciously to a polyisocyanurate foam core without altering other advantageous properties of the foam, such as a low friability and flammability. Further, the present invention is concerned with an efficient, energy saving process requiring reduced production time and cure temperatures for producing a laminate of a polyisocyanurate foam having improved facing sheet adhesion and moldability, while maintaining other advantageous physical properties of the laminate, such as superior fire resistant properties, which would qualify for approval by the Factory Mutual Research Corporation, as, e.g., a Class I rating in the Factory Mutual calorimeter test for roof insulation products. The present invention involves the development of an improved polyisocyanurate foam, which is prepared by reacting an organic polyisocyanate with a polyol blend comprising a an alkylene oxide adduct of an aromatic amine capped with ethylene oxide, and b an aromatic polyester polyol in the presence of a blowing agent and a catalyst s .

The polyol blend containing components a and b can be obtained simply by mixing together, at the time of use in producing the rigid polyisocyanurate foam of the invention, the individual components a and b , which are synthesized separately prior to use. Preferably, the alkoxylated aromatic amine is employed within a range of from 10 to 50, more preferably 20 to 40, percent by weight of the blend while the aromatic polyester polyol is employed within a range of from 50 to 90, more preferably 60 to 80, percent by weight.

The blend is a liquid having a hydroxyl number of 362 415 and a Brookfield viscosity at 25 C of 2,3 2.95 Another preferred blend comprises 25 percent by weight of Pluracol Polyol 735 and 75 percent by weight of the aromatic polyester polyol supplied by Hercules Inc. under the trademark Terate 202 . In the broadest aspects of the present invention, any organic polyisocyanate can be employed in the preparation of the foams of the present invention. The organic polyisocyanates which can be used include aromatic, aliphatic and cycloaliphatic polyisocyanates and combinations thereof. Representative of these types are the diisocyanates such as m phenylene diisocyanate, toluene 2, 4 diisocyanate, toluene 2,6 diisocyanate, mixtures of 2,4 and 2,6 toluene diisocyanate, hexamethylene 1,6 diisocyanate, tetramethylene 1, 4 diisocyanate, cyclohexane 1,4 diisocyanate, hexahydrotoluene 2,4 and 2,6 diisocyanate, naphthalene 1 5 diisocyanate, diphenylmethane 4,4 diisocyanate, 4,4 diphenylenediisocyanate, 3,3 dimethoxy 4,4 biphenyldiisocyanate, 3,3 dimethyl 4, 4 biphenyldiisocyanate, and 3,3 dimethyldiphenylmethane 4,4 diisocyanate the triisocyanates such as 4,4 ,4 triphenylmethanetriisocyanate, polymethylenepolyphenyl isocyanate, toluene 2,4,6 triisocyanate and the tetraisocyanates such as 4,4 dimethyldiphenylmethane 2, 2 ,5,5 tetraisocyanate. These isocyanates are prepared by conventional methods known in the art such as the phosgenation of the corresponding organic amine. In a preferred rigid foam of the invention, the organic polyisocyanate is polymethylene polyphenylisocyanate. The polymethylene polyphenylisocyanates desirably have a functionality of at least 2.1 and preferably 2.5 to 3.2. These preferred polymethylene polyphenylisocyanates generally have an equivalent weight between 120 and 180 and preferably have an equivalent weight between 130 and 145. The friability of foams made with these polyisocyanates is desirably less than 30 , preferably less than 20 . A preferred subclass of polymethylene polyphenylisocyanates especially useful in the present invention is a mixture of those of the following formula wherein n is an integer from 0 to 8 and wherein the mixture has the above described functionality and equivalent weight. This mixture should have a viscosity between 0,1 and 4 and preferably 0,25 to 2,5 Pascal seconds measured at 25 C. in order to be practical for use in the present invention. Examples of suitable polymethylene polyphenylisocyanates useful in the present invention include those of the above formula, wherein n is 1 as well as mixtures wherein n can have any value from 0 to 8 as long as the mixture has the specified equivalent weight. One such mixture has 40 weight percent of n 0, 22 weight percent of n 1, 12 weight percent of n 2, and 26 weight percent of n 3 to 8. The preferred polymethylene polyphenyl isocyanates are described in British Patent Specification No. 1,433,641. The synthesis of polymethylene polyphenylisocyanates is described in Seeger et al., U. S. Pat. No. 2,683,730 and in Powers U.S. Pat. No. 3,526,652 at column 3, lines 6 21. It should, therefore, be understood that the polymethylene polyphenylisocyanates available on the market under the tradenames of CODE 047 or PAPI 20 Upjohn and Mondur MR 200 Mobay can successfully be employed within the spirit and scope of the present invention. In order to ensure complete reaction, the polymethylene polyphenylisocyanate and the polyol blend are mixed in an equivalent ratio of 1.5 1 to 6 1 and preferably 2 1 to 5 1. In ranges outside these proportions the reaction yields a product having undesirable physical characteristics. At higher ratios the product has an undesirably high friability. At lower ratios the product has an undesirably high flammability. In the preparation of these polyisocyanurate rigid foams, any catalysts known to catalyze the trimerization of isocyanates to form isocyanurates, and to catalyze the reaction of isocyanate groups with hydroxyl groups to form polyurethanes, can be employed. The preferred catalysts give cream times of 15 to 30 seconds and firm times of 25 to 80 seconds. One preferred type of catalyst is a mixture of a tertiary amino phenol, such as 2,4,6 tris dimethylaminomethyl phenol, and an alkali metal carboxylate, such as potassium 2 ethyl hexoate, the synthesis and use of which are described in U.S. Patent No. 4,169,921. The equivalent ratio of tertiary amino phenol to alkali metal carboxylate in the cocatalyst composition is desirably 0.4 1 to 2.5 1. Another catalyst system is that employing an epoxide, an N substituted aziridine, and a tertiary amine. The synthesis and use of such a catalyst are described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,799,896. The catalysts generally comprise from 0.1 to 20 and preferably from 0.3 to 10 weight percent of the total composition. Any blowing agent typically employed in similar prior art foam products containing polyisocyanurate linkages can be employed in the foam compositions of the present invention. In general, these blowing agents are liquids having a boiling point between minus 50 C. and plus 100 C. and preferably between 0 C. and 50 C. The preferred liquids are hydrocarbons or halohydrocarbons. Examples of suitable blowing agents include, among others, chlorinated and fluorinated hydrocarbons such as trichlorofluoromethane, CCl₂FCClF₂, CCl₂FCF₃, diethylether, isopropyl ether, n pentane, cyclopentane, and 2 methylbutane. Trichlorofluoromethane is a preferred blowing agent. The blowing agents are employed in an amount sufficient to give the resultant foam the desired bulk density which is generally between 0.5 and 10, and preferably between 1 and 5 pounds per cubic foot between 8 and 160, and preferably between 16 and 80 kg per cubic meter . The blowing agent generally comprises from 1 to 30, and preferably comprises from 5 to 20 weight percent of the composition. When the blowing agent has a boiling point at or below ambient, it is maintained under pressure until mixed with the other components. Alternatively, it can be maintained at subambient temperatures until mixed with the other components. Any suitable surfactant can be employed in the foams of this invention. Successful results have been obtained with silicone ethylene oxide propylene oxide copolymers as surfactants. Examples of surfactants useful in the present invention include, among others, polydimethylsiloxane polyoxyalkylene block copolymers available from the Union Carbide Corporation under the trade names L 5420 and L 5340 and from the Dow Corning Corporation under the trade name DC 193 . Other suitable surfactants are those described in U. S. Patent No. 4,365,024 and U.S. Patent No. 4,529 745 EP A 124 111 . Generally, the surfactant comprises from 0.05 to 10, and preferably from 0.1 to 6 weight percent of the foam forming composition. Other additives may also be included in the foam formulations. Included are flame retardants, such as tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate, dispersing agents, plasticizers, fillers and pigments. The polyisocyanurate foams of the present invention are simply produced by mixing the components with the result that foaming and curing take place. The mixing can be accomplished at 0 to 50 C., and preferably at 10 to 30 C. The process can be practiced as a batch or continously. The laminate of the present invention can be formed by contacting the foaming mixture with any of the sheet materials or facers conventionally employed in laminated foam insulation products. Such facing materials include, but are not limited to, metal, paper, corrugated cardboard, plastics, wood, glass and textiles. In some cases, adhesion can be improved by coating the facing materials before lamination with conventional coating compositions such as vinyl or epoxy compounds. Particularly suitable facers for use in the invention are asphalt fiber glass facers, asphalt saturated roofing felt, perlite board, aluminum foil, and fiberboard. The advantages of the present invention will become more apparent by reference to the following detailed description and drawing which is a side schematic representation of an apparatus suitable for producing a polyisocyanurate foam material in accordance with the present invention. The apparatus comprises an isocyanate tank 10, a polyol tank 11, and a catalyst tank 12, each respectively connected to outlet lines 13, 14, and 15. The temperatures of the ingredients are controlled to ensure satisfactory processing. The lines 13, 14, and 15 form the inlet to metering pumps 16, 17, and 18. The pumps 16, 17, and 18 discharge respectively through lines 19, 20, and 21 which are in turn respectively connected to flexible lines 22, 23, and 24. The flexible lines 22, 23, and 24 discharge to mixing head 25. The apparatus is also provided with a roll 26 of lower facing sheet material and a roll 26 of upper facing sheet material. The apparatus also can be provided with a roll 27 of glass fiber mat material when it is desired to reinforce the structural laminate. The apparatus also includes metering rolls 28 and 29, and an oven 30 provided with vents 31, 31 for blowing hot air. Lower and upper endless conveyors 32 and 33 are positioned in oven 30 to contain the expanding foam. Both endless conveyors 32 and 33 can comprise a series of articulated platens, such as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,043,719. The apparatus is also provided with pull rolls not shown for pulling the facing sheets and optional glass fiber mat through the apparatus, and cutting means 34. In another embodiment of the invention, a rigid facer such as perlite board is continuously conveyed along the production line in place of the lower facing sheet material. The individual perlite boards are transported along the line by means of conveyor rollers not shown . In operation, the isocyanate tank 10 is charged with an organic polyisocyanate admixed with a blowing agent and surfactant, and the polyol tank 11 is charged with the polyol blend to be used according to the invention, and the catalyst tank 12 is charged with a catalyst composition. The speeds of the pumps 16, 17, and 18 are adjusted to give the desired ratios of the ingredients in the tanks 10, 11, and 12. These ingredients pass respectively through lines 19, 20, and 21 as well as lines 22, 23, and 24, whereupon they are mixed in the mixing head 25 and discharged therefrom. Optionally, lines 20 and 21 can feed into a single conduit for delivery to the mixing head. By virtue of rotation of the pull rolls, lower facing sheet 35 is pulled from the roll 26, and upper facing sheet 35 is pulled from the roll 26 , and, when applicable, glass fiber mat 36 is pulled from the roll 27. The facing sheet and glass fiber mat materials pass over idler rollers such as idler rollers 37 and 38 and are directed to the nip between metering rolls 28, 29. The mixing head 25 is caused to move back and forth, i.e., out of the plane of the paper by virtue of its mounting on a reciprocating mechanism not shown . In this manner, an even amount of material can be maintained upstream of the nip between the metering rolls 28, 29. The composite structure at this point now comprising a lower facing sheet 35, an upper facing sheet 35 on either side of a foam forming mixture 39 and optionally a mat 36 of glass fibers, now passes into the oven 30. While in the oven 30 the foam forming mixture expands under the influence of heat added by the hot air from vents 31, 31 and due to the heat generated in the exothermic reaction between the polyol blend and the isocyanate in the presence of the catalyst. As the foam expands upwardly, it comes into contact with upper facing sheet 35 , forcing the sheet against conveyor 33 and causing the sheet to assume a substantially planar disposition on the upper correspondingly planar surface of the foam. The temperature within the oven is controlled by varying the temperature of the hot air from vents 31, 31 , in order to insure that the temperature within the oven 30 is maintained within the limits necessary to cure the foam employed, as, e.g., from 100 F. to 350 F. and preferably 150 F. to 250 F. 37 C. to 177 C. and preferably 65 C. to 120 C. . The structural laminate 40 then leaves the oven 30, and is cut by cutting means 34 into individual panels 41, 41 . While the structural laminate of the invention can contain various reinforcement materials, in a preferred embodiment glass fiber mat 36 comprises a thin, substantially incompressible yet expansible mat of glass fibers, as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,118,533 and 4,284,683. This thin mat 36 of glass fibers is distinguished by having the fibers arranged in layers, and the fibers within each layer are long, generally having a length greater than one foot and preferably 5 to 12 feet 0.30 m and preferably 1.52 to 3.66 m , and at an angle to the fibers in each next adjacent layer. Before passing through the nip of the metering rolls, thin fiber mat 36 is advantageously passed through intermeshing corrugated rolls not shown , which effect a transverse stretching of the mat, as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,346,133. When the mat 36 of glass fibers thereafter passes through the nip between the two rotating metering rolls 28 and 29, pressure is applied to the mat by the metering rolls, causing the foam forming mixture 39 to penetrate the interstices between the glass fibers forming the mat. After passing through the nip, the glass fibers expand under the influence of the expansion of the foam forming mixture 39 and become distributed in the foam core of the structural laminate. Numerous modifications to the apparatus will be immediately apparent to those skilled in the art. For example, the tanks 10, 11, and 12 can be provided with refrigeration means in order to maintain the reactants at subambient temperatures. The use of aromatic polyester polyols as the polyol component in the manufacture of polyisocyanurate foam laminates can result in poor facer adhesion during the time period immediately following production of the laminate. This can bring about handling problems and delamination of the facers. While the adhesion may be improved by further heat treatment and or storage of the laminate, employment of the polyol blend makes it possible to produce polyisocyanurate foam laminates whose facers already strongly adhere to the foam core right after production, without the extra time and expense required in the case of laminates based solely on aromatic polyester polyols. The invention is further illustrated by the following example in which all parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise indicated. This example illustrates the process of the present invention and a comparative process for producing structural laminates by reference to the drawing. The polyol blend as defined in Claim 1 and a comparative aromatic polyester polyol were employed in preparing the foam cores of the structural laminates of the following Table II, utilizing the inventive isocyanurate formulations 1 to 4, and comparative isocyanurate formulations 5 and 6 of the following Table I. The production of each structural laminate can be illustrated with reference to the drawing. For each laminate, items A, G and H of the respective formulation were mixed with each other and placed in tank 10. Items B and C, in the case of each inventive formulation, were mixed and placed in tank 11, whereas, in the case of the comparative formulations, item B alone was placed in tank 11. The catalytic composition comprising a solution of items D and E in items F and F or F alone inventive formulation 2 was placed in tank 12 in the production of each laminate. Table II below shows for the production of each of laminates A to F the top and bottom facers utilized, the quantity of reinforcing glass fiber mat utilized, and the oven temperature. For each run, the apparatus was provided with rolls 26 , 26 of the top and bottom facers, and a roll 27 of glass fiber mat material. The mat 36 of glass fibers was substantially incompressible. The glass fibers forming the mat were long, generally straight fibers having an average diameter of less than 25 microns and lengths varying from 5 to 12 feet 1.52 to 3.66 m with an average length of over 5 feet 1.52 m . With the oven 30 heated to an appropriate temperature, the facers and glass fiber mat were fed toward the nip of metering rolls 28 and 29, and the pumps 16, 17 and 18 were started to discharge the contents of the tanks 10, 11 and 12 into the respective feed lines to carry the ingredients to the mixing head 25. The glass fiber mat was stretched by being passed through a pair of intermeshing corrugated rolls to effect a rupture of some of the fiber to fiber bonds. The mixing head 25 deposited the foam forming mixture onto the lower facer and both upper and lower facers, glass fiber mat, and foamable mixture were then conveyed into the oven 30 to produce each of laminated structural panels A to F. Various properties of the resulting structural laminates are reported in Table III below. The physical property data presented in Table III reveal that use of the aromatic amino polyether polyol in combination with the aromatic polyester polyol used in preparing the foam core of comparative structural laminates E and F has no adverse effect on resulting inventive structural laminates A to D. Most importantly, the inventive structural laminates displayed a facer adhesion which was far superior to that of the laminates made with an aromatic polyester polyol as the sole polyol, indicating that the aromatic amino polyether polyol is eminently suitable to partially replace the polyester polyol in the production of structural laminates.
