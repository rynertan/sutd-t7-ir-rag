# Apparatus for continuously freezing liver piece.

## Abstract
An apparatus for continuously freezing liver pieces which comprises a freezing box having an inlet and an outlet, a conveyor movable from the inlet to the outlet of the freezing box and having a mesh belt, a number of nozzles provided laterally through the box at the upside of the mesh belt of the conveyor for blowing gaseous helium, a supply ing guide portion formed at the head of the inlet at the upside of the mesh belt for supplying and placing the liver pieces, a rotatable roller journaled at the striking off and exhausting portion disposed inside the striking off and ex hausting portion at the head of the outlet at the upside of the mesh belt in an outside contacting state laterally of the mesh belt, the roller having a number of striking off projections projected from the surface thereof for striking off the frozen liver pieces on the mesh belt by the insertion of the projec tions into the mesh belt. Thus, the apparatus can efficiently freeze the liver piece instantaneously without irregularity by instantaneously blowing helium gas in contact with the liver piece to obtain a frozen liver capable of performing the function of the liver at the thawed time.
