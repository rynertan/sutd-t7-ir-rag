# Process for forming a semiconductor cell in a silicon semiconductor body and a mixed CMOS bipolar integrated circuit formed in a plurality of such cells.

## Abstract
Deep cells are formed on a silicon substrate by depositing in a recess in the substrate a body of alpha silicon, e.g. by plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition, at a temperature below 550 DEG C. The layer is recrystallised to a single crystal layer by heating the structure to a temperature between 550 and 900 DEG C. The technique overcomes the problems of water distortion experienced in conventional high temperature epitaxial growth.
