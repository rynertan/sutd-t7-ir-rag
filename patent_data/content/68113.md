# Auto threshold slow start control circuit for a centrifuge.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a slow start control network which includes a field effect transistor 12 triggered by the voltage across a charging capacitor 14 . The field effect transistor 12 permits current flow through a portion I of an associated centrifuge drive motor control arrangement N . A supplemental charging current source 20 is provided to assist the charging of the capacitor 14 to the triggering signal level within a predetermined short delay time.
