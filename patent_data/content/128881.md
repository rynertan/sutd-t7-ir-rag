# POTENTIOMETER DEVICE FOR DETERMINING THE POSITION OF HYDRAULIC PISTONS AND THE LIKE

## Abstract
The invention relates to a potentiometer device for a hydraulic cylinder 11 for example. On the inside of a tube 10 there are, evenly distributed about the circumference and parallel to its axis, two conductors and a linear resis tance in the form of strips. This tube 10 is mounted inside the piston rod 14 and is open at the piston 13 . The conduc tors are joined to opposite ends of the linear resistance, and the tube 10 is movable together with the piston 13 . A sta tionary contact holder 15 is attached to a tube 16 fastened in the end of the cylinder opposite to where the piston rod emerges. Said contact holder has three leads 4, 5, 6 drawn through the hydraulic cylinder 11 and being attached to individual slide contacts in the contact holder 15 making contact with the respective conductors and the linear resis tance.
