# Method of producing a preform rod for an optical fiber.

## Abstract
A glass layer 2 is formed inside a silica glass tube 3 and another glass layer 1 having a refractive index higher than that of the abovementioned glass layer 2 is formed on said glass layer 2 . After these glass layers 1,2 are formed, one end of the glass tube 3 is collapsed. While the internal pressure of the glass tube is being reduced below the atmospheric pressure, the glass tube is caused to collapse by heating, thereby yielding a preform for an optical fiber. The optical fiber produced from this preform has the difference in the refractive indices of the two orthogonal major axes x, y of at least 1.6 10 ‚Å¥ and maintains the linear polarization plane.
