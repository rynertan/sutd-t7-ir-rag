# Tire building machine and method.

## Abstract
A tire building machine and method employing a tire build ing drum 21 for receiving at least one ply of tire material 79 having an edge overhanging an axial end 23 of the drum, a bladder turn up mechanism 28 extending axially outwardly from the drum, an annular array of radially contractible ply down fingers 56 movable axially to and from a position en circling the overhanging ply edge, and an axially movable ring device operative first to effect radial contraction of the ply down fingers to turn the ply edge down over the end of the drum, then to set a tire bead 77 against the turned down ply edge at the end of the drum, and then to push the bladder 42 of the turn up mechanism when inflated to cause the ply edge to be progressively wrapped around the bead and then over the drum. In addition to a bead setting ring 74 and a ply down fin ger camming ring 75 , the ring mechanism includes a con toured bladder control ring 76 operative axially to push and radially to restrain the bladder, developed pressure in the blad der being reduced after contact is made with the control ring and then held at reduced pressure to allow the control ring to force the bladder to wrap around the bead and roll over the drum thereby to continue progressive wrapping of the ply edge around the bead and then over the drum with a bulge 82 in the bladder forming in front of the axially inwardly moving control ring. Thereafter, the pressure in the bladder is further reduced, particularly in the case of long ply locks, to continue rolling of the bladder at the bulged portion to provide maximum ply lock with relatively low pressure sustained in the bladder. Finally, the bladder is reinflated while simultaneously retracting the control ring.
