## Description
POLYMERIZATION INHIBITION BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention This invention relates generally to the recovery of an alpha , beta ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid by distillation and, more particularly, concerns the inhibition of the polymerization of an alpha , betaethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid during its recovery by distillation.Discussion of the Prior Art Esters of alpha , beta ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acids are large volume chemicals prepared by esterification of the corresponding alpha , betaethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acids. In order to obtain such an ester of the desired purity, it is important that the alpha , beta ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid starting material is sufficiently pure. However, in the separation and purification of an alpha , beta ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid under distillation conditions, it has been found that the azid tends to polymerize even when conventional inhibitors are present. For example, recently interest has developed in the production of an ester of an alpha , beta ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid by a process involving the reaction of a saturated aliphatic monocarboxylic acid of one less carbon atom and formaldehyde to form the alpha , beta ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid. The reaction results in a mixture of the alpha , beta ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid and the saturated aliphatic monocarboxylic acid of one less carbon atom, as well as other by products such as alpha , beta unsaturated ketones, for example, 2,5 dimethylcyclopent 2 en l one.After separation of the alpha ., beta ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid from the saturated aliphatic monocarboxylic acid of one less carbon atom, the alpha , beta ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid is esterified to form the ester of an alpha , beta ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic b acid. Esterification of the alpha , beta ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid with an alcohol in the presence of the saturated aliphatic monocarboxylic acid of one less carbon atom leads to the formation of an unwanted ester of the saturated aliphatic monocarboxylic acid of one less carbon atom. Therefore, it is essential to separate the saturated aliphatic monocarboxylic acid of one less carbon atom from the alpha , beta ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid prior to contacting the alpha , beta ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid with the alcohol. However, the separation of the alpha , beta ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid from the saturated aliphatic monocarboxylic acid of one less carbon atom by conventional methods such as distillation is difficult.For example, if distilled, the alpha , beta ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid polymerizes readily upon the application of heat.The resulting solid polymer deposits form in the distillation column and in the interconnecting lines. These deposits interfere with the efficient operation of the plant and eventually build up to such an extent that the plant must be shut down for cleaning. Although the addition of inhibitors such as phenothiazine, benzoquinone, hydroquinone, 4 tertbutylcatechol, and p phenylenediamine does reduce the polymerization of an alpha , beta ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid under these conditions, such inhibitors require the presence of oxygen in the distillation column, which can reduce the efficiency of the separation being effected in the column and can create an explosive mixture in the overhead condenser of the column. In addition, if the distillation were performed under reduced pressure, it would be difficult to keep a sufficient level of oxygen in the liquid phase. Nitroxide radicals disclosed by 0. L. Lebedev andS. N. Kazarnovski, Tr. po Khim. i Khim. Tekhnol 2,649 656 1959 have been demonstrated by Bailey, U.S. Patent No.3,747,988, to be suitable stabilizers against the polymerization of acrylonitrile under distillation conditions and in either the presence or absence of oxygen. However, such nitroxide radicals have never been employed to stabilize an alpha , beta ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid against polymerization under distillation conditions. Related materials that have been employed to stabilize styrene and methyl methacrylate against polymerization at a temperature of 600C during purification, storage and transport are disclosed in U.S.S.R. Inventor s Certificate No. 1027150 and are represented by the following general formula EMI3.1 where Y is NH CH2 6 NH orEMI3.2 Stable free radicals can, in principle, both initiate and terminate radical polymerization reactions.With increasing temperature, their initiating action will become relatively more pronounced, because termination is a radical radical reaction requiring zero or a low energy of activation, while the addition of a radical to a monomer usually reguires energy of activation exceeding 5Kcal. Mol. Thus, although stable nitroxide radicals are known, it is not obvious that the nitroxides of the present application would be particularly effective as polymerization inhibitors for an alpha , beta ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid at relatively high temperatures above 600C . OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION It is therefore a general object of the present invention to provide an improved method for recovering and purifying an alpha , beta ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid by distillation which meets the aforementioned requirements and solves the aforementioned problems. More Frticlarl, it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved method for recovering and purifying an alpha , beta ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid by distillation in which the alpha , beta ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid is stabilized against polymerization. Other objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent upon reading the following detailed description and appended claims. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION These objects are achieved by an improved process of the present invention for the purification of an alpha , beta ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid by distillation, comprising introducing into the distillation column a nitroxide radical having the essential skeletal structure EMI4.1 wherein each of R1, R2, R3 and R4 is an alkyl group containing from 1 to 15 carbon atoms, Xl and X2 are the same or different, and each of X1 and X2 is an alkyl group containing from 1 to 15 carbon atoms halogen, cyanide, orEMI5.1 wherein R5 is an alkyl group containing from 1 to 15 carbon atoms or an aryl group containing from 6 to 12 carbon atoms,EMI5.2 S, C6H5, S COCH3, OCOCH3, OCOC2H5, or an alkenyl group containing up to 15 carbon atoms where the double bond is not in conjugation with the groupEMI5.3 or X1 and X2 taken together form á ring. DETAILED DESCRIPTION Thus, according to the present invention, there is provided a process for the recovery of an alpha , betaethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid by distillation, which process comprises introducing to the distillation column a nitroxide free radical having the following essential skeletal structure EMI6.1 wherein R1, R2, R3 and R4 are alkyl groups and no hydrogen is bound to the remaining valencies on the carbon atoms bound to nitrogen. The alkyl groups R1, R2, R3 and R4 may be the same or different, and contain 1 to 15 carbon atoms. It is particularly preferred to use a nitroxide radical in which R1, R2, R3 and R4 are methyl, ethyl or propyl groups. The remaining valencies of the carbon atoms in the essential skeletal structure which are not satisfied byR1, R2, R3, R4 or nitrogen may be satisfied by any atom or group except hydrogen which can bond covalently to carbon although some groups may reduce the stabilizing power of the nitroxide structure and are undesirable.Thus, atoms or groups which are suitable as X1 and X2 are an alkyl group containing from 1 to 15 carbon atoms, halogen, cyanide, orEMI6.2 wherein R5 is an alkyl group containing from 1 to 15 carbon atoms or an aryl group containing from 6 to 12 carbon atoms,EMI6.3 S, C6H5, S COCH3, OCOCH3, OCOC2H5, or an alkenyl group containing up to 15 carbon atoms where the double bond is not in conjugation with the group EMI7.1 X1 and X2 may also form part of a ring. Examples of suitable compounds having the aforesaid essential skeletal structure and in which X1 and X2 form part of the ring are the pyrrolidine oxyls and the piperi dine 1 oxils, such as 2,2,6,6 tetramethyl 4 hydroxy piperidine 1 oxyl. In addition, nitroxide radicals which are suitable for use in the method cf this invention include compounds formed b the reaction of 2,2,6,6 tetramethyl 4oxopiperidine 1 oxyl With hexamethylenediisocyanate or witb the acyl bichloride of butylterephthalic acid as describe in U.S.S.R.Inventor s Certificate No. 1027150 and having the formula EMI7.2 where N is NH CH2 6 NH orEMI7.3 where X1 and X2 are alkyl or alkenyl groups, the nitroxide radical employed in the method of this invention is represented by the following formula EMI8.1 where the groups R6 and R7 are alkyl or alkenyl groups.Examples of suitable groups R6 and R7 are methyl, ethyl and propyl groups, such as in the di tert butyl nitroxide radical. Preverabiy, X1 and X2 taken together form a ring more preferably, the nitroxide radical is a piperi dine oxyl or a pyrrclidine l oxyl radical, and most preferably, the itrcide is 2,2,6,6 tetramethyl 4 oxopiperdine oxyl of the formula EMI8.2 or 2,2,6,6 tetramethylpiperidine 1 oxyl of the formula EMI8.3 The aforesaid nitroxide radicals may be prepared by the methods disclosed by 0. L. Lebedev and S. N. Kazarnovski, Tr. po Khim. i Khim. Tekhnol. 2, 649 656 1959 and in U.S.S.R. Inventor s Certificate No. 1027150. Suitably, the aforesaid nitroxide radicals are employed in the method of thus invention at a concentration in the range of from about 1 to about 10,000 preferably from about 50 to 5,000, parts per million parts of the alpha , beta ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid, and do not require the presence of oxygen. The aforesaid nitroxide radicals are suitable for use o er a wide range of temperatures, but typically the distillation temperature employed in the method of this invention is preferably in the range of from about 650C to about 175 C, more preferably from about 900C to about 150 C, and most preferably from about 1200C to about 15CtC. The method of the present invention is performed at an absclute pressure in the range of from about 10 to about 20D millimeters f mercury. Of the various alpha , beta ethylenically unsatu ated compounds, it is generally recognized that meth acryiic acid has one of the greatest tendencies to polymerize, and it is extremely difficult to handle at elevated temperatures. In this regard, it has been found that the presence of certain reaction by products greatly increase the propensity of methacrylic acid to polymerize. Specifically, the alpha , beta unsaturated ketone by products, such as ethylisopropenyl ketone and 2,5 dlety cytlopent have have been shown to greatly increase the degree of methacrylic acid polymerization. For example, methacrylic acid alone polymerizes after 80, 19 and 8 minutes of exposure to temperatures of 100 C, 120 C and 14O0C, respectively while methacrylic acid in its mixture with 2,5 dimethylcyclopent 2 en l one containing 1 weight percent of 2,5 dimethylcyclopent 2en 1 one polymerizes after only 18, 5 and 2.5 minutes of exposure to temperatures of 100 C, 120 C and 1400C, respectively.In these instances, the time of polymerization is defined as the first appearance of a cloudy solution precipitation of solids generally followed the first appearance of a cloudy solution within about 30 se onc. Therefore, the benefits from the use of the aforesaid r...rox de radical in the method of the present invention are maximized when an alpha , beta unsaturated ketone such as 2,5 dimethylcyclopent 2 en l one is present in the distillation feedstock. Although the method of the present invention can be employed for the recovery of an alpha , beta ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid in general, it is preferred to practice the method of the present invention for the recovery of such alpha , beta unsaturated monocarboxylic acid prepared by the aldol type condensation under vapor phase conditions at a temperature of about 280 to 350 C of 1 a saturated aliphatic monocarboxylic acid such as acetic or propionic acid of one less carbon atom than the alpha , beta ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic aid product, and 2 a formaldehyde compound in the presence of a solid catalyst.While any suitable source of formaldehyde compound can be used, such as formalin, paraformaldehyde, methanolic formaldehyde, trioxane, etc., it is preferred to use substantially anhydrous formaldehyde, particularly cracked monomeric gaseous, substantially anhydrous formaldehyde. A large number of catalysts exhibit activity in such an aldol type condensation reaction. Specific catalyst materials that are useful in the process include synthetic alkali metal aluminosilicates, natural alkali metal aluminosilicates, synthetic alkaline earth metal aluminosilicates, natural alkaline earth metal aluminosilicates, alkali metal hydroxides on synthetic aluminosilicates, alkali metal hydroxides on natural aluminosilicates, alkaline earth metal hydroxides on synthetic aluminosilicates, alkali metal hydroxides on silica gel, alkaline earth metal hydroxides on silica gel, sodium silicate on silica gel, potassium silicate on silica gel, molybdenum oxide on silica gel, silica gel, synthetic manganese aluminosilicate, natural manganese aluminosilicate, synthetic cobalt aluminosilicate, natural cobalt aluminosilicate, synthetic zinc aluminosilicate, and natural zinc aluminosilicate. It is preferred to employ a catalyst comprising at least one cation of a Group I or Group II metal and a silica support. The alkali metal and or alkaline earth metal cations of the catalyst can be used in a concentration of 0.01 to 0.20 equivalent, preferably 0.010 to 0.10 equivalent, of the cation per 100 grams of silica support, on a dry solids basis. Catalyst compositions found to be especially useful in the reaction to form an alpha , beta ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid from a saturated monocarboxylic acid of one less carbon atom and formaldehyde are the subject of Hagen et al., United States patent application Serial No. 624,040, and Kaduk et al., United States patent application SerialNo. 624,041, both filed June 25, 1984, both of which are specifically incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Suitable sources of alkali metal and alkaline earth metal cations include sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, cesium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, rubidium hydroxide, strontium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, lithium phosphate, trisodium phosphate, cesium phosphate, sodium borate, barium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, cesium fluoride, cesium nitrate, etc. Of these, the alkali metal cations are preferred. While any commercially available colloidal silica can be used, it is preferred to use commercially available colloidal silicas having an average particle di am eter of 40 to 1000 Angstrom units, particularly those having a particle diameter of about 50 to 250 Angstrom units, in order to produce silica supported catalysts having a surface area of 20 to 275 mê g, a pore volume of 0.1 to 0.8 cc g and an average pore diameter of about 75 to 200 Angstrom units, which are the subject of copending patent application Serial No. 624,040.As pointed out in patent application Serial No. 624,040, silica catalysts comprising at least one cation of a Group I or Group II metal and a silica support, said support having a surface area of 20 to 275 m2 g, a pore volume of 0.1 to 0.8 cc g and an average pore diameter of 75 to 200 Angstrom units, have relatively high activity that is, percent conversion and selectivity and relatively long life. Pore volume, surface area and average pore diameter are interdependent variables. Other things being equal, holding one variable constant, as the surface area increases, pore volume increases as the surface area increases, average pore diameter decreases and as the pore volume increases, average pore diameter increases.It is critical in patent application Serial No. 624,040 that the catalyst satisfy each of the pore volume, surface area and average pore diameter requirements. The silica can be treated either prior to dying or after calcination with cations. Catalysts prepared by the addition of the cations to the colloidal silica before or during gelation can be viewed as coformed catalysts which are the subject of copending patent application Serial No. 624,041. As pointed out in patent application Serial No. 624,041, coformed catalysts are advantageous in the sense that they are substantially more water tolerant than catalysts prepared by the treatment of the calcined silica with an aqueous solution of the cation and they are easier to decoke since, other things being equal, they do not exotherm as much as catalysts prepared by impregnation. This is apparently due to the more uniform distribution of the cations in the support. The silica supports are preferably prepared by forming an aqueous composition comprising about 10 to 60 percent by weight colloidal silica on a dry basis and alkali metal and or alkaline earth metal cation. The colioidal silica is gelled by adjusting the pH to a range of about 3 to 10, preferably about 6 to about 9, preferably with alkali metal or alkaline earth metal cations.Salts such as NH4NO3 can be used to accelerate gelation.While silica hydrogels can be aged for two weeks or more, aging seems to have no effect on the properties of the catalyst and accordingly, aging is not necessary. The composition is then dried by any suitable means, such as in a microwave oven, to constant weight and apparent dryness, for example, about 4 to 5 percent moisture on a dry solids basis. Apparently, only the water of hydration is retained by the silica gel after drying to constant weight. The silica gel is then calcined at about 3000C to 8000C, preferably about 3000C to 6000C. In this preferred embodiment, the synthesis reactor feedstock should be composed of the saturated aliphatic monocarboxylic acid, formaldehyde, and some water. The mole ratio of the saturated aliphatic monocarboxylic acid to formaldehyde should be maintained within the range of from about 25 1 to about 1 25 with a preferred range of from about 2 1 to about 1 2. The preferred concentration of water in the reactor including water formed during the reaction is at least 3 weight percent water in the reactor contents. The synthesis reaction takes place over a wide temperature range of from about 2800C to about 5000C.Desirable and advantageous results are obtained by operating with temperatures in the range of about 280 C to about 3500C. The process is normally run at atmospheric pressure, although higher or lower pressures can be used. The space velocity of the vaporized feed mixture over the catalyst may be varied over wide limits. Space velocity figures in this specification are based on the total number of moles of materials entering the catalyst zone. Total moles are multiplied by the volume of a mole of an ideal gas at OOC and one atmosphere 22.4 liters mole , to obtain the total volume. A space velocity in the range from about 100 liters per hour per liter of catalyst to about 1000 liters per hour per liter of catalyst is preferred. The synthesis reactor effluent stream contains water of reaction, one mole of water for each mole of the alpha , beta ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid produced. An element of the preferred embodiment of the process of the invention is distillation of the reactor effluent stream under process conditions wherein 60 90 weight percent of the unreacted formaldehyde and 25 70 weight percent of the unreacted saturated monocarboxylic acid entering the distillation column are removed by a side draw from the central part comprising from 10 to 90 of the theoretical trays of the distillation column for recycle to the synthesis reactor. The distillation column overhead consists of water, a small amount of formaldehyde and a trace of the saturated monocarboxylic acid.The distillation column bottoms contain the alpha , beta ethylericaly unsaturated monocarboxylic acid, the saturated monocarboxylic acid and the heavy by products of the alpha , beta ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid synthesis reaction. The distillation column temperatures depend on the pressure employed and the identity of the particular alpha , beta ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid. When the alpha , betaethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid is methacrylic acid, preferred distillation column conditions are Column Temperatures Overhead, OC 71 79 Side Draw, oC 99 121 Bottoms, OC 141o157o Column Pressure, Atm. 1 The primary purpose of the reactor effluent distillation tower is to remove water from the alpha , betaethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid synthesis reactor effluent. The overhead from this tower, consisting of formaldehyde, water and a small amount of the saturated monocarboxylic acid, is sent to a formaldehyde recovery and dehydration section. The bottoms from this tower consisting of the saturated aliphatic monocarboxylic acid reactant and unaturated carboxylic acid product and heavy by products are passed tc a second distillation column operated under acu to separate the saturated aliphatic monocarboxylic acid as overhead from the alpha , beta ethylenicaly unsaturated monocarboxylic acid in the bottoms. The present invention will be more clearly understood from. the following specific examples. Exartles 1 9 In each of Examples 1 9, an approximately 30 gram mixture contalnin propionic acid and methacrylic acid was introduced into a 3 necked 100 milliliter flask. 2,5 dimethylcyclopent 2 en 1 one A and the inhibitor 2,2,6,6 tetramethylpiperidine 1 oxyl B were also introduced. The lower half of the flask was inserted into a stirred oil bath which was maintained at the desired test temperature. The flask was equipped with a thermometer, reflux condenser and a sparge tube through which nitrogen was spared into te solution. After the flask was immersed in the oil bath, the contents of the flask reached the test temperature in 5 7 minutes. The time when polymerization occurred was determined by withdrawing small aliouots of the mixture from the flask at frequent intervals and diluting each aliquot with an equal volume of dodecane to precipitate a polymer that formed.The time difference between the time when the solution in the flask reached the test temperature and the time when the slightest haze appeared in a diluted aliquot was defined as the time to polymerization. Precipitation of solids generally occurred in 30 60 seconds after the haze appeared. The weight ratio of propionic acid to methacrylic acid in the solution in the flask was 6s 40 in each of Examples i 4 and 7 9, 63 3, in Example 5, and 61 39 inExample 6. The concentration of A in the solution in the flask was 1 weight percent in Examples 1 4 and 7 9 and 0.6 weight percent in Examples 5 6. The test temperature, weight percent of B in the solution in the flask, the weight percent of B in the solution in the flask divided by the weight percent of A in the solution in the flask, the number of parts of B per million parts by weight of methacrylic acid MA in the solution in the flask, and the time to polymerization for each of Examples 1 9 are presented in Table 1. Examples 10 20 In each of Examples 10 20, the procedure of Examples 1 9 was repeated, except that methacrylic acid alone, instead of a mixture of methacrylic acid and propionic acid, was rtrcduced wit A and R iPto the flask. The concentration of A in the solution in the flask was 1 weight percent in Examples 10 12, 3 weight percent inExamples 13 15 and 17 18, and 1.5 weight percent in Examples 16, 19 and 20.The test temperature, weight percent of B in the solution in the flask, the weight percent ofB in the solution in the flask divided by the weight percent of A in the solution in the flask, the number of parts of B per million parts by weight of methacrylic acid MA in the solution in the flask, and the time to polymerization for each of Examples 10 20 are presented in Table 2. Examples 21 25 In each of Examples 21 25, the procedure of Examples 10 20 was repeated, except that in Examples 22, 23 and 25, 2,2,6,6 tetramethyl 4 oxopiperidine 1 oxyl was employed as the inhibitor instead of 2,2,6,6 tetramethyl piperidine l oxyl. The test temperature was 1160C in each of Examples 21 25. The concentration of A in the solution in the flask was 3 weight percent in Examples 21 23 and 1.5 weight percent in Examples 24 25.

Examples 26 27 In each of Examples 26 and 27, a feed comprising propionic acid and formaldehyde in a molar ratio of 0.95 moles of propionic acid per mole of formaldehyde was fed continuously to a vapor phase reactor containing a bed of a catalyst comprising 5 weight percent of cesium hydroxide calculated as elemental cesium on silica having a surface area of 150 mê g and maintained at a temperature of 3240C and a pressure of 4 psig.The pro pIcnic acid and ormaldeyde reacted te fcrm methacrylic acid, and the reactor effluent was fed to a first distillation column which was operated at atmospheric pressure and an overhead temperature of 760C, a side draw temperature of 1150C and a bottoms temperature of 1470C and contained 40 inches of packing material disposed above 20 oldershaw trays. The mixture was introduced at the level of the 18th tray from the bottom. The polymerization inhibitor was dissolved in propionic acid and introduced into this column at the level of the 20th tray from the bottom. Methacrylic acid, propionic acid and heavy reaction by products were recovered as a bottoms product, and passed to a second distillation column which was operated at a pressure of 100 millimeters of mercury measured at the top of the column , an overhead temperature of 870C and a bottoms temperature of 1160C and contained 35 oldershaw trays. The polymerization inhibitor was dissolved in propionic acid and introduced into this column near its top. Methacrylic acid and heavy reaction byproducts were recovered as a bottoms product. The system was operated at steady state, and the following data were collected over a 2 hour period during steady state operation. In each of Examples 26 and 27, approximately 3,170 grams of propionic acid and 1,373 Table 3 Conc. of Conc. of Inhibitor, Conc. of B, Inhibitor based based on TimeExample Wt. on A Wt.

In Example 27, the first ad second distillation cclumns were operated at reflux ratios of 2.2 and 2.9, respectively. 3.22 grams and 1.3i grams cf 2,2,6,6 tetramethyl 4 oxopiperidine l oxyl as the inhibitor were introduced into the first and second distillation columns, respectively, in Example 26 during the 2 hour period. 2.89 grams and 1.19 grams of 2,2,6,6 tetrarethylpiperidine 1 oxyl as the inhibitor were introduced into the first and second distiilation columns, respectively, in Example 27 during the 2 hour period.In Examples 26 and 27, the bottoms from the second cistillation column weighed 1,189 grams and 1,122 grams, respectively, of which approximately 85 weight percent was methacrylic acid. 0.68 weight percent andG.63 weight percent of the bottoms from the second dis tllaticn column in Examples 26 and 27, respectively, were precipitated as polymeric solids upon dilution with an equal volume O r dodecane. The results of Examples 1 20 illustrate that the polymerization time is a function of the distillation te. .erature. A a particular is illaticn temperature, the polymerization time varies inversely with the concentration of the polymerization inhibitor divided by the concentration of the polymerization accelerator A .Obviously the concentration of the polymerization inhibitor that should be employed to effect the desired inhibition depends on the identities of the alpha , beta ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid, of the polymerization accelerator for example, 2,5 dimethylcyclopent 2 en 1 one present, and of the inhibitor employed, the amount of polymerization acceler ator present, the elevated temperature, and the time for wic the alpha , beta ethylenically unsaturated mor.ocar bcxylic acid is exposed to the elevated temperature. Furthermore, by contrast to the steady state operations illustrated by Examples 26 and 27, when a nitroxide free radical polymerization inhibitor of the type employed in the method of this invention was not employed, polymerization and deposition of solid polymers occurred so quickly that the system could not be operated long enough to establish steady state conditions. From the above description, it is apparent that the objects of the present invention have been achieved.While only certain embodiments have been set forth, alternative embodiments and various modifications will be apparent from the above description to those skilled in the art. These and other alternatives are considered equivalents and within the sprit and scope of the present invention. Having described the invention, what is claimed is
