# TIME SAVING METHOD FOR COMPUTING SQUARE ROOTS ON A COMPUTER HAVING A ONE BIT AT A TIME DIVISION INSTRUCTION

## Abstract
A method for reducing the time for computing square roots by the Newton Raphson iteration which is designed to be implemented on various types of small mini and micro computers which do not have a full word divide capability but which do have at least a one bit at a time divide instruction. Only as many result digits are generated upon each iteration as are shown to be accurate, whereby up to a fifty percent saving in computing time may be realized.
