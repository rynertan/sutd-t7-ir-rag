# Composition for therapeutic or diagnostic use.

## Abstract
Compositions for therapeutic or diagnostic use in connection with bacterial infections containing as an active constituent the structural element, preferably in terminal position Î± D Galp 1 4 D Gal. A process for the therapeutic treatment of mammals including man, comprising administering to the mammal an active amount of such a composition. A process for identification or quantification of such structural element in native biological material from mammals including man, comprising using antibodies, the generation of which has been initiated by such composition. A process for the identification of bacterial acceptor structures pili, syn. fimbriae recognizing the described structural ele ment, comprising using this recognition. A process for purifying acceptor structures of bacteria, comprising us ing for the purification the affinity between such structural element and the corresponding acceptor structures on the bacteria. A method of diagnosing mammals including man in regard to proneness to bacterial infection involv ing such receptor structure, comprising generating anti bodies against said receptor structure and recording the reaction of said antibodies and cells from the mammal.
