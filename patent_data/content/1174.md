## Description
A peptide and the salts thereof, processes for their preparation and compositions containing them The present invention relates to a peptide and the salts thereof, processes for their preparation and compositions containing them. The peptide possesses interesting anorexigenic properties. The present invention is based upon the discovery of a novel peptide found in the urine of patients suffering from severe anorexia, which peptide possesses interesting anorexigenic properties and is thus of potential interest for use against obesity caused by overeating. Thus according to one feature of the present invention there is provided L pyro glutamyl L histidylglycine and salts thereof. The chemical formula of the novel tripeptide of the present invention is thus EMI2.1 the pyroglutamyl and histidyl moieties being of theL series. The salts useful for incorporation in pharmaceutical compositions are the physiologically compatible salts.Other salts may however be useful in the preparation of the novel tripeptide and the physiologically compatible salts thereof. According to a further feature of the present invention there is provided a process for the preparation of L pyro glutamyl L histidyl glycine which comprises deprotecting a compound of the formula EMI2.2 wherein the pyroglutamyl and histidyl moieties are each of the L series, each of Rl and R3 represents a hydrogen atom or an amino protecting group and R2 represents a hydroxyl group or a carboxyl protecting group with the proviso that at least one of R1, R2 and R3 represents a protecting group whereby L pyro glutamyl L histidylglycine or a salt thereof is obtained. As indicated, the compound of formula II may be only partially protected, only one or two of R1, R2 and R3 then being in protected form such compounds may be prepared by selective partial deprotection of a compound of formula II in which all of R1, R2 and R3 are in protected form or they may be synthesised in partially protected form. In particular, R3 will commonly be hydrogen. Where, however, a compound of formula II is used in which R1, R2 and R3 each represent a protecting group it is advantageous to remove all the protecting groups simultaneously. A compound of formula I or a compound of formula II may, for example, be prepared by reacting a compound of the formula EMI3.1 wherein the pyroglutamyl and histidyl moieties are each of the L series, each of R1 and R3 represents a hydrogen atom or an amine protecting group and X represents a hydroxyl group or a carboxylic acid activating group with a compound of the formula NH2 CH2 COR2 iv wherein R2 represents a hydroxyl group or a carboxyl protecting group whereby a compound of formula I or II is obtained. A compound of formula III is preferably used in which R1 represents an amine protecting group and or X represents a carboxylic acid activating group. R3 is preferably hydrogen. A compound of formula IV is preferably used in which R2 represents a carboxyl protecting group. Similarly a compound of formula I or a compound of formula II may, for example, be prepared by reacting theL isomer of a compound of the formula EMI4.1 wherein R1 represents a hydrogen atom or an amine protecting group and X represents a hydroxyl group or a carboxylic acid activating group with the L isomer of a compound of the formula EMI5.1 wherein R2 represents a hydroxyl group or a carboxyl protecting group and R3 represents hydrogen or an amine protecting group whereby a compound of formula I or II is obtained.

A compound of formula VI is preferably used in which h represents a carboxyl protecting group. A compound of formula III as hereinbefore defined wherein X represents a carboxylic acid activating group may, for example, be prepared by reacting the L isomer of a compound of formula III wherein X represents a hydroxyl group by methods known per se to form a compound of formula III wherein X represents a carboxylic acid activating group. A compound of formula III as hereinbefore defined wherein X represents a hydroxyl group may, for example, be prepared by reacting the L isomer of a compound of the formula EMI6.1 wherein R1 represents a hydrogen atom or an amine protecting group and X represents a hydroxyl group or a carboxylic acid activating group with the L isomer of a compound of the formula EMI6.2 wherein R2 and R3 have the above meanings and where a compound of formula VII is used in which R2 represents a carboxyl protecting group converting the compound thus obtained into a compound of formula III wherein X represents a hydroxyl group by deprotection of the carboxyl protecting group. It is preferred to use a compound of formula V in which R1 represents an amine protecting group and or in which X represents a carboxylic acid activating group.It is also preferred to use a compound of formula VII in which R2 represents a carboxylic acid protecting group, which group is then removed after the reaction to form a compound of formula III in which X represents a hydroxyl group. A compound of formula VI as hereinbefore defined may for example be prepared by removal of the amine protecting group or groups from a compound of the formula EMI7.1 wherein Rj represents an amine protecting group and R3 represents hydrogen or an amine protecting group whereby a compound of formula VI is obtained. The compound of formula VI or VIa may, for example, be prepared by reacting the L isomer of a compound of formula EMI7.2 wherein R1 and R3 have the above meanings and X represents a hydroxyl group or a carboxylic acid activating group with a compound of the formula NH2 CH2 COR2 IV wherein R2 represents a hydroxyl group or a carboxyl protecting group whereby a compound of formula VI orVia is obtained. It is preferred to use a compound of formula VIII in which R1 represents an amine protecting group, which group is removed after the reaction. It is also preferred to use a compound of formula VIII in which X represents a carboxylic acid activating group. A compound of formula IV is preferably used in which R2 represents a carboxyl protecting group. R3 is preferably hydrogen. Where in any of the above reactions a mixture of products is obtained the desired product may be isolated from the reaction mixture by conventional methods known per se. It will be appreciated that the compounds of the present invention may, if desired, be prepared according to the processes herein described using the solid phase method of peptide synthesis. In such a method the carboxyl protecting group of the C terminal amino acid may be in the form of a resin. The compounds of formula IV, V, YII and VIII are either readily available starting materials or may readily be derived from available starting material according to methods well known in the literature. A wide choice of protecting and activating groups as well as procedures for protecting, activating and coupling amino acids are known and are exemplified inSchroder, E., and flibke, K., The Peptides Vols 1 or 2,Academic Press, New York and London, 1965 and 1966 Pettit, G.R., Synthetic Peptides, Vols 1 4, Van Nostrand,Reinhold, New York 1970, 1971, 1975 and 1976 Houben Weyl,Methoden der Organischen Chemie, Synthese von Peptiden,Band 15, Georg Thiene Verlag, Stuttgart 1974 and AminoAcids, Peptides and Proteins, Vol 4 8, The Chemical Society,London 1972, 1974, 1975 and 1976. Thus, for example amine protecting groups which may be employed include the carbobenzoxy hereinafter also designated Gbz or Z , t butoxycarbonyl hereinafter also designated BOC and acyl groups such as, for example, an acetyl group or a formyl group. Carboxyl protecting groups which may, for example be employed include readily cleaved ester groups such as benzyl hereinafter also designated Bzl , E nitrobenzyl or t butyl groups. Carboxylic acid activating groups which may, for example, be employed include mixed anhydrides, azides or activated esters such as for example the E nitrophenyl ester, a 2,4,5 trichlorophenyl ester, or an N hydroxysuccinimidyl ester. It will be appreciated that a wide range of other such groups exist as, for example, detailed in the abovementioned literature references and the use of all such groups in the hereinbefore described processes fall within the scope of the present invention. The processes of the present invention will generally be effected by the use of L pyroglutamyl and L histidyl starting materials in the absence of the D isomers thereof.It is thus desirable to conduct the reactions under conditions which avoid racemisation in order to avoid the need for a resolution process at the end of the total reaction sequence. It is also possible, but less convenient, to use racemic pyroglutamyl and histidyl starting materials and include one or more optical resolution stages. Carboxyl protecting groups may be introduced by conventional methods e.g. by reaction with a suitable esterifying reagent, for example an alcohol such as benzyl or p nitrobenzyl alcohol in the presence of acid, e.g. toluenesulphonic acid. Amine protecting groups may be introduced by conventional methods e.g. by reaction with suitable acid halides such as carbobenzoxyl chloride or pivaloyl chloride, or acid anhydrides such as acetic anhydride. In general it is convenient to effect the coupling reactions at low temperatures, for example, 200C up to ambient temperature conveniently in a suitable solvent system, for example, tetrahydrofuran, dioxan, dimethyl formamide, methylene chloride or a mixture of these solvents. The coupling of free amino and carboxyl groups may, for example, be effected using dicyclohexylcarbodiimide DCC . Another coupling agent which may, for example, be employed is N ethoxycarbonyl 2 ethoxy 1,2 dihydroquinoline. Activation of carboxyl groups may for example be effected by conversion of the acid to a reactive derivative e.g. the acid anhydride which may for example be prepared by the use of ethyl or isobutyl chloroformate.Acylation of another amino acid with a mixed anhydride or other activated carboxyl derivative may be effected by methods conventional in the peptide synthesis. Usually, the reaction product after the coupling step contains one or more protecting groups If desirable, these can be removed, for example in a selective way. Thus it is possible to remove only certain groups, keeping others intact during the subsequent reaction s . As stated above a wide range of procedures exist for removing amine protecting groups and carboxyl protecting groups. Thus, for example an amine protecting group may be removed by acidolysis, hydrogenolysis, treatment with dilute ammonium hydroxide, treatment with sodium, treatment with sodium amide, treatment with hydrazine, or enzymatic hydrolysis with, for example, leucineaminopeptidase. Methods which are of interest also include treatment with anhydrous hydrogen bromide for example in glacial acetic acid, treatment with trifluoroacetic acid and catalytic hydrogenation. Thus carbobenzoxy and t butoxy carbonyl groups may be removed, for example, using anhydrous hydrogen bromide conveniently in the presence of glacial acetic acid or using trifluoroacetic acid conveniently in the presence of concentrated hydrochloric acid acyl groups may for example be removed by conventional hydrolysis with acid or by enzymic hydrolysis as described above. The removal of carboxyl protecting groups may, for example, be effected by saponification, acidolysis, hydrogenolysis or enzymatic hydrolysis. Thus, for example, saponification may be effected with an alkali metal hydroxide conveniently in the presence of water, an alcohol and or acetone. Acidolysis may, for example, be effected by the use ofanhydrous hydrogen bromide or trifluoroacetic acid and hydrogenolysis may, for example, be effected by catalytic hydrogenation e.g. by the use of palladium on carbon conveniently 10 palladium on charcoal. Enzymatic hydrolysis may, for example, be effected by the use of leucineaminopeptidase.Thus, for example, benzyl and nitrobenzyl groups may be removed by hydrogenolysis and t butyl groups may, for example, be removed by acidolysis or saponification. Amine protecting groups and carboxyl protecting groups may, for example, be removed simultaneously by acidolysis, alkaline hydrolysis, hydrogenolysis, treatment with sodium or sodium amide or by enzymatic hydrolysis.Such methods include treatment with hydrogen bromide conveniently in the presence of glacial acetic acid and treatment with an alcohol conveniently containing dissolved dry hydrogen chloride. One method of deprotection is, for example, catalytic hydrogenation, conveniently using palladium on for example carbon as the catalyst and conveniently in the presence of a solvent e.g. water, methanol, dioxan, acetic acid or t butanol. This method removes, for example, the carbobenzoxy group, but leaves the t butoxycarbonyl or an acyl group intact. The reaction product can then be isolated and purified by known methods, such as for example extraction, crystallization or chromatography e.g. thin layer or column . It may be.advantageous to isolate and purify the desired peptide product by salt formation e.g.hydrochloride, hydrobromide or dicyclohexylamine salt formation . Intermediates and the end products may, for example, be characterized by chromatographic parameters purity control , optical rotation and possibly spectroscopic data. According to a still further feature of the present invention there are provided pharmaceutical compositions comprising as active ingredient at least one compound of formula I as hereinbefore defined or a physiologically compatible salt thereof in association with a pharmaceutical carrier or excipient. The compositions according to the invention may be presented, for example, in a form suitable for oral, parenteral or rectal administration. The term pharmaceutical as used herein includes veterinary applications of the invention. The compounds according to the invention may be presented in the conventional pharmacological forms of administration, such as tablets, coated tablets, solutions, emulsions, powders, capsules or sustained release forms.Conventional pharmaceutical excipients as well as the usual methods of production may be employed for the preparation of these forms. Tablets may be produced, for example, by mixing the active ingredient or ingredients with known excipients, such as for example with diluents, such as calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or lactose, disintegrants such as corn starch or alginic acid, binders such as starch or gelatin, lubricants such as magnesium stearate or talcum, and or agents for obtaining sustained release, such as carboxypolymethylene, carboxymethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate phthalate, or polyvinylacetate. The tablets may if desired consist of several layers. Coated tablets may be produced by coating cores, obtained in a similar manner to the tablets, with agents commonly used for tablet coatings for example polyvinyl pyrrolidone or shellac, gum arabic, talcum, titanium dioxide or sugar. In order to obtain sustained release or to avoid incompatibilities, the core may consist of several layers too. The tablet coat may also consist of several layers in order to obtain sustained release, in which case the excipients mentioned above for tablets may be used. Syrups of the active ingredient according to the invention or combinations of active ingredients may additionally contain a sweetener, such as saccharin, cyclamate, glycerin or sugar, and or taste improving agents such as flavourings, e.g. vanillin or orange extract. They may also contain suspension agents or thickeners, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, wetting agents, such as for example condensation products of fatty alcohols with ethylene oxide, or preservatives, such as Eb hydroxybenzoates. Injection solutions may, for example, be produced in the conventional manner, such as by the addition of preservation agents, such as p hydroxybenzoates, or stabilizers, such as Complexons. The solutions are then filled into injection vials or ampoules. Capsules containing one or several active ingredients may be produced for example by mixing the active ingredients with inert carriers, such as lactose or sorbitol, and filling the mixture into gelatin capsules. Suitable suppositories may, for example be produced by mixing the active ingredient or active ingredient combinations with the conventional carriers envisaged for this purpose, such as natural fats or polyethyleneglycol or derivatives thereof. Advantageously, the compositions may be formulated as dosage units, each unit being adapted to supply a fixed dose of active ingredient. Tablets, coated tablets, capsules, suppositories and ampoules are examples of suitable dosage unit forms. Each dosage unit preferably contains 5 to 100 n.mol of the said active ingredient and especially 15 to 50 n.mol of the said active ingredient. As indicated above, the new compounds may be administered to humans or other animal subjects. The optional dosage is, in general, proportional to surface area and will be in the range 5 to 50 n.mol mê surface area day. Thus, for humans having a surface area of the 2 order of 1.5 to 2.0 m , the optional daily dose will be in the range 7.5 to 100 n.mol day. A course of treatment of 1 to 5 weeks, for example 3 weeks is appropriate. In general, administration is preferably by injection. According to a still further feature of the present invention there ia provided a method of treating obesity caused by overeating which comprises administering an effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition as hereinbefore defined to a patient suffering from such obesity. The peptides may also be used to produce animal models which can be studied and used for therapeutic experiments. A further major use of the new peptide, however, is in the production of material for immunological assay techniques. The peptide may then be covalently attached to a suitable high molecular carrier such as albumin, polylysine or polyproline in order to be injected into the antibody producing animal e.g. rabbits, guinea pigs or goats . High specificity antisera are obtained by use of well known absorption techniques using the high molecular carrier. By introducing radioactivity 14 18 15 C, 180, N etc. into the peptide molecule, a radioimmuno assay can readily be designed and used for determining the peptide in the different biological fluids such as serum plasma , urine and cerebrospinal fluid. In the Example deprotection by catalytic hydrogenation is effected using 10 palladium on carbon as the catalyst. The method of the Example has been chosen so as to avoid side chain protection, thus simplifying the total experimental procedure.
