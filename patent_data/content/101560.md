# Thermistor controlled fuel heater.

## Abstract
A fuel heater in which the liquid fuel is heated while being transported through a fuel line. A resistance heater extending along a portion of the fuel line for heating the fuel is connected in series with a thermistor element across a current source. The thermistor is in electrical and thermally conductive contact with the fuel line. The thermistor element is positioned upstream of the resistance heater and has a low temperature resistance which is less than the resistance of the heater but increases to a much higher resistance value when the temperature of the thermistor increases.
