# Polarizable electrode body, a method for its making and an electric double layer capacitor comprising the polarizable electrode body.

## Abstract
Polarizable electrode using, as its constituent element, a sheet form member consisting of activated carbon fiber and a binding medium as its components, and also to an electric double layered capacitor using this polarizable electrode as its constituent. In comparison with a conventional polariz able electrode consisting merely of activated carbon fiber clothes, the density can be further improved and the stored charge per unit volume can be increased. Furthermore, the charge stored in the polarizable electrode can be regulated easily.
