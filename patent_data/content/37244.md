# Method for fabricating a solid state imaging device using photoconductive film.

## Abstract
A solid state imaging device comprises a scanner IC having a two dimensional matrix of switching transistors 17 , on top of which are deposited a photoconductive film 28 and a transparent electrode 31 . The photoconductive film is deposited 29 through an opening 25 in a shield plate or mask plate 26 , so that it is not deposited over a scanning shift register 16 . The transparent electrode 31 is then formed on top of the photoconductive film, either through the same or a different shield plate, or by photo etching. Voltages applied to the transparent electrode 31 therefore do not affect the shift register 16 .
