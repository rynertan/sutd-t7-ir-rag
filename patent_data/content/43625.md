## Abstract
Coating composition, particularly car refinish, which can be readily sprayed, has good levelling properties and surface gloss, and exhibits low dust attraction. The binder comprises 1 10 60 parts b.w. of a polyacrylate having an acid number of 0 15 and a weight average molecular weight of 10,000 60,000, 2 30 75 parts b.w. of an acrylated alkyd resin resulting from the polymerisation of a mixture of 20 80 b.w. of an acrylate monomer and 80 20 b.w. of an olefinically unsaturated alkyd resin having a weight average molecular weight of 500 1500 and an iodine number of 20 70, and 3 5 45 parts b.w. of a cellulose ester, the sum of said basic components totaling 100 parts b.w. The cellulose ester used may be cellulose aceto butyrate.
