# Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator.

## Abstract
A first oscillator dictates the pulse duration and frequency of stimulating signals the oscillator output wave form is coupled to an output amplifier stage, and thence to the patient. A scanning oscillator provides a substantially linear ramp voltage, which in turn controls pulse duration, pulse frequency, and pulse intensity modulators. In turn, these modulators appropriately establish conditions within the first oscillator and the output stage whereby the output parameters are scanned through respective predetermined ranges, thereby periodically achieving optimum stimulating conditions.
