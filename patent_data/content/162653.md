# A BUS ARRANGEMENT FOR ADDRESSING EQUIPMENT UNITS AND A METHOD THEREFOR

## Abstract
A bus arrangement for providing equipment units 10 with an address is disclosed. Each individual equipment unit 10 achieves its address automatically according to its rei ative physical position within the organization of the units 10 without the need for setting any switches. In simplistic terms, this is achieved by providing at each unit, modification of the bus leads. This includes the termination of one lead 13 , the addition of one lead 13 , and the relative reposi tioning of the other leads.
