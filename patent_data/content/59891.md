# Optical slip ring assembly.

## Abstract
An optical slip ring assembly couples an optic signal from a rotating source to a stationary detector. The rotor 12 of the optical slip ring comprises a rotor optic fiber 22 having a first end 28 coupled with the optic signal source and a second end portion having one side adapted to form a light emitting area 26 of a selected length. The stator comprises a plurality of stator fibers 34 each having a first pickup end and a stator block 16 for mounting the fiber pickup ends in a radially symmetric array opposite the light emitting area of the rotor 12 whereby an optic signal transmitted from the source through the rotor fiber 22 is picked up by the stator 34 fibers.
