# Method of producing sterile and optionally concentrated juices with improved flavor and optionally reduced acid.

## Abstract
Ultrafiltration 10 is employed to preferentially pass an ultrafiltration UF permeate 12 containing flavor and aroma components while retaining spoilage microorgan isms in a UF retentate 13 . The UF retentate is then treated in an inactivation stage 16 in an inactivation stage 16 to inactivate a sufficient number of spoilage microorganisms to inhibit spoilage of the juice under storage conditions. A UF permeate 12 containing flavor and aroma components is then recombined with the UF retentate 15 to provide a food juice suitable for storage while avoiding the loss or alteration of the desirable flavor and aroma components of fresh juice encountered in conventional juice processing. If desired, spoilage enzymes can be retained in the UF retentate 13 and inactivated in an inactivation stage 16 to inhibit deterioration of desirable juice qualities. Further, the UF permeate 12 can be further treated by reverse osmosis 11 to concentrate flavor and aroma components in an RO retentate 14 . if desired, the acid content of juice can be reduced by passing a portion of the RO retentate 14 or UF permeate 12 through an ion exchange column in a deacidi fication stage 18 .
