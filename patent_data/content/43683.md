# Friction clutches.

## Abstract
A friction clutch assembly incorporates a pressed steel cover member 11 having an annular pressure plate 13 ar ranged within a recess 12 in the cover 11. Drive straps 21 con nect lugs 17 of the pressure plate to the cover and allow rela tive axial movement between cover and pressure plate. A di aphragm spring 22 provides a clutch clamping load tending to urge the pressure plate out of the recess in the cover. Stops 23, integral with the cover and set back from the mounting flange 14 of the cover, are arranged to engage directly the lugs 17 of the pressure plate to prevent excess movement of the pressure plate which could deflect the drive straps 21 exces sively.
