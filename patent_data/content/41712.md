# Turbo compressor having a surge suppressing arrangement.

## Abstract
A series of airfoil cross section equidistantly spaced normally parallel vanes 20A E are disposed linearly across the mouth of an induction housing port 14 which lies on an essentially flat plane non intersecting with the axis of rotation of a turbo compressor wheel 10 . A control mechanism moves the vanes 20A E upon the compressor tending to surge so that each of the vanes is moved through an angle different from the preceeding one, whereby the air flows pas sing between the vanes are deflected and converge upstream of the compressor wheel 10 and swirl theretoward in the form of a single flow to impinge on the blades 18 of the wheel 10 with a uniform and reduced angle of incidence.
