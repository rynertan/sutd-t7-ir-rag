The applicants are aware of only one p blication dealing with the concept of using tobacco mosaic virus, hereinafter referred to asTMV, or components of TMV as a vector or part of a vector for the intro duction of foreign genetic information into plants. This publication was entitled, Uses of Viruses as Carriers of Added Genetic Information by S. Rogers and P.

Some embodiments of the present invention are concerned with the construction of at least a portion of an RNA plant virus vector fromTMV which will enable the transfer into, and the replication and expression of foreign genetic information in plants or plant cells. Novel features of the said at least a portion of a plant virus vector are believed to be 1 The said at least a portion of an RNA plant virus vector is constructed from tobacco mosaic virus DS and other RNA plant Viruses.2 This said at least a portion of a plant virus vector will enable the transfer of genetic information into and the replication and expression of this information in plants or plant cells.3 The inserted genetic information will be in the form of RNA rather than DNA, as in bacterial plasmids.4 The said at least a portion of a plant virus vector utih inserted genetic information in the form of RNA is in sone embodiments of the present invention, constructed in such a manner as to utilize a unique capability of TMV, namely to direct the synthesis of extremely large amounts of a single protein. In the accompanying drawings which illustrate, by way of example, embodiments of the present invention Figures 1 and 2 together depict a flow diagram of the basic steps involved in the replication of complete TXV and related strains of virus, Figure 3 depicts diagrams showing how replication of TMV, and related strains of virus, is thought to proceed and the possible effects that the addition of genetic information to the 3 end may have on replication, Figure 4 is a diagrammatic view of nucleotide sequences Fragments I and II from TMV, and related strains of viruses, which may be used for the construction of a plant virus vector, or portion thereof, Figure 5 is a flow diagram of the construction of an at least a portion of an RNA plant virus vector from TMV and related strains of virus by the deletion of at least a portion of the coat protein gene and replacement of said gene or a portion thereof by RNA nucleotide sequences coding for the synthesis of a desired product, Figure 6 is a flow diagram of the construction of an at least a portion of an RNA plant virus vector from TMV and related strains of virus having at least a portion of the nucleation region deleted to prevent the encapsidation of the RNA vector or portion thereof by viral coat protein, Figures 7 to 9 together depict a flow diagram for the generation and isolation of specific nucleotide sequences fragments I and II fromTMV, and the construction of an RNA vector or portion thereof therefrom, through to the recovery of the replicated vector or portion thereof from infected plants or plant cells, these figures also depict the insertion of foreign genetic information into the RNA vector or portion thereof and the subsequent expression of the foreign genetic information resulting in the synthesis of a gene derived product in plants or plant cells, Figures 10 and 11 together depict a different flow diagram for the generation and isolation of specific nucleotide sequences FragmentsI and II from TMV, and the construction of an SSA vector or portion thereof therefrom, through to the recovery of the replicated vector or portion thereof from infected plants or plant cells, these figures also depict the insertion of foreign genetic information into the RNA vector or portion thereof and the subsequent expression of the foreign genetic information resulting in the synthesis of a gene derived product in plants or plant cells, and Figures 12 to 15 together depict a different flow diagram forX the generation and isolation of specific nucleotide sequences FragmentsI and II from TMV, and the construction of an RYK vector or portion thereof therefrom, through to the recovery of the replicated vector or portion thereof from infected plants or plant cells, these figures also depict the insertion of foreign genetic informat on into the RNA vector or portion thereof and the subsequent expression of the foreign genetic information resulting in the synthesis of a gene derived product in plants or plant cells. In figures 1 and 2, NR is the nucleation region, C is the control region for the expression of the coat protein gene, and CPC is the coat protein gene. Referring now to figures 1 and 2, T V, and related strains in the form of virus particles, generally designates 1, enters plant cells not shown through natural or artificial openings. During or shortly after entry into the cells, the viral coat protein 2 is removed disks sembly la , freeing the viral RNA 4. The viral SNA 4 from the infecting virus particle is hereinafter ref erred to as the plus strand.The strand 4 initially functions as messenger RNA mrRNA for the synthesis of the viral replicase enzyme s 6 or for a viral protein s which modify existing or induced cellular RNA polymerases in such a manner as to function as viral replicase s 1b, Ic and lid . As will be described later, this initial functioning of the strand 4 as 2hRNA requires a leader sequence in the form of a ribosome 8 binding site 3 and may require a cap structure m7GpppG at the 5 end. Following synthesis of the viral replicase 6, the strand 4 functions as a template for the synthesis of the minus strands, such as 12, which is complementary in nucleotide sequence to the strand 4.Binding of the viral replicate or polmerase 6 to the strand is effected by recognition of a nucleotide sequence 10 at or near the 3 end of viral RNA 4 le . After or during completion of the synthesis of the strands, such as 12, If , the viral polymerase 6 recognizes a sequence 13 at or near the 3 end of the strands, such as 12, 1g , which is complementary to the 5 end of the strand 4. This recognition results in the strands, such as 12, functioning as a template for the synthesis of strands, such as 14, of viral RNA 1h . The synthesis of viral coat protein 16 is accomplished by using strands, such as 14, either directly as SNA li or portions thereof in the form of fragments 18 generated by processing 1j . The synthesis of viral coat protein 16 may also be accomplished by using strands such as 12, to direct the synthesis of less than full length portions 20 of a strand, which function as mRNA for the synthesis of coat protein 16 1k . Translation of the coat protein gene CPG , in whatever form the m RNA takes, requires the rcognition of a specific nucleotide sequence by cellular ribosomes 8. This sequence likely lies immediately prior to i.e. to the left of in figures li , lj and 1k the sequences which direct the synthesis of the viral coat protein.The coat protein is produced in far greater amounts than other viral gene products. Based on recovery of complete virus particles from infected plants, the yield of coat protein ranges from 1 10 g kg g kg fresh weighc of leaf material complete TMV is 95Z protein and 5 RNA . In some varieties of tobacco, the virus is able to spread and replicate throughout the plant systemic infection after entry into one or more cells at the site of infection. It is this systemic invasion which in large part accounts for the high yield of virus obtainable. Subsequent to coat protein synthesis, these proteins recognize and bind to a specific nucleotide sequence at approximately 1000 nucleotides from the 3 end of viral RNA molecules. This sequence is referred to as the nucleation region NR . Binding then proceeds in both directions from this region. Thus the viral RNZ is encapsidated coated with viral proteins and complete virus accumulates in the cytoplasm of the infected cell. The RNA plant virus vector or portion thereof, from TMV and r related strains of virus will follow the same basic steps that are involved in the synthesis of complete TMV and related strains of virus as those described with reference to figures 1 and 2. In figure 3, similar parts to those shewn in figures 1 and 2 are designated in the same manner and the previous description is relied upon to describe them. Based on the generally accepted understanding of the events involved with RNA plant virus replication in general, and mU replication in particular, at the time of filing this patent application, while the contributions by Rogers and Pfuderer were useful, their teachings have not led to an accepted technique for the insertion or addition of foreign genetic information, in the form of RNA, into tobacco mosaic virus and other RNA plant viruses, or the subsequent use cf this virus as vectors for the introduction into and replication and expression of foreign genetic information in plants or plant cells, for the following reason. Referring to figure 3, addition of genetic information, in the form of poly A, to the 3 end of the viral RNA L is likely not to have been replicated by the viral replicase enzyme 6. This enzyme presumably recognizes a specific site unique sequence of cleotides 10 at or near the 3 end of the viral RNA molecule 3a . RepsLcation is then believed to proceed from the 3 end of the viral RNA tovard the 5 end left hand end of the viral RNA 3bY. Because the poly A claimed added by Rogers and Pfuderer would have been to the right hand side of the replicase binding site 10 and to the right of the 3 end of the viral RNA 3c , the poly A sequence would nbt have been replicated and thus would have been lost for subsequent steps in virus synthesis 3d .The loss of the polyA at this stage would have precluded continued expression of the added information within the plant. This is supported by the observation that poly A added to the 3 end of bacteriophage QB RYA is not replicated in or expressed by infected bacteria and, therefore, subsequently not present in progeny viral RNA. See C. Gilvarg et al, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. B.S.A. 72, 428 432, 1975. An alternative to this is that mU RNA molecules, modified by 3 end poly A addition, may not be replicated in the plant 3e . This is supported by the observation that bacteriophage QB RNA, modified by poly A addition to the 3 end of the molecule, is not replicated in vitro by purified viral replicase see R. Devos et al,Biochem. et Biophys. Acta 447, 319 327, 1976 . Based on the above analysis and supporting literature, it can be concluded that the approach of Rogers and Pfuderer could not be applied to the use of plant RNA viruses as vectors or vehicles for the introduction of foreign genetic information into plants. Further, as will be seen from the following, the Rogers and Pfuderer disclosure would lead a person skilled in the art away from the introduction of specific genetic information into TMV vectors according to the present invention. As previously stated, the Rogers and Dfuderer disclosure is the only one of which the applicants are aware which may be interpreted to relate to the specific use of RNA plant viruses such as IMA and related strains as vectors for the introduction, replication and expression of foreign genetic information into plants or plant cells. In figure 4, similar parts to those shown in figures 1 and 2 are designated in the same manner and the previous description is relied upon to describe them. Referring now to figure 4, certain aspects of the present invention are concerned with the construction from specific nucleotide sequences Fragments I and II of viral RNA derived from tobacco mosaic virus T V or related strains to form a vector or portion thereof for the introduction of foreign genetic information into, and the subsequent replication and expression of this information in plants or plant cells.The vector or portion thereof may be constructed from the following viralRNA nucleotide sequences and techniques 1 Fragment I. A nucleotide sequence or fragment which originates from the 5 end of the viral RNA, the actual size nucleotide length of this fragment to depend on the specific approach used to generate this fragment. This nucleotide sequence is designated Frag. I Ex.1 or Frag. I Ex. 2 in figure 4, each of which is shown dashed when generated.2 Fragment II. A nucleotide sequence or fragment which originates from the 3 end of the viral RNA, the actual size nucleotide length of this fragment to depend on the specific approach used to generate this frag ment. This nucleotide sequence is designated Frag. II Ex.l or Frag. II Ex. 2 in figure 4, each of which is shown dashed when generated.3 The cleavage of nucleotide sequences present in a vector or portion thereof, at specific sites in such a manner as to allow the introduction of foreign genetic information into those sites.4 The insertion and method of insertion of foreign genetic information into or immediately adjacent to the coat protein gene, as will be described later.Recuirements for Construction of a Functional nSA Plant Virus Vector or aPortion thereof, from RNA Plant Viruses such as T n and Related Strains of Virus For the RNA vector or portion thereof to be functional, it rust contain those nucleotide sequences essential for replication recognition by viral polymerase , expression and control of expression of inserted genetic information, examples of which are a the fragment originating from the 5 end hereinafter referred to asFragment I , and extending in the 3 end direction and comprising those nucleotide sequences complementary to the recognition and binding sites for the viral polymerase in the minus strand of viral RNA, and b the fragment originating from the 3 end hereinafter referred to asFragment II , and extending in the 5 end direction and comprising those nucleotide sequences for the recognition and binding of the viral polymerase in the plus strand of viral RNA, and wherein c at least one of the Fragments I and II contains at least a portion of the viral coat protein gene, and d the Fragments I and II, alone or in combination, contain a nucleotide sequence which will control the expression of the coat protein gene, hereinafter referred to as the control region.It should be noted that the above mentioned essential nucleotide sequences may be present in their original or a modified form. In figures 5 and 6, similar parts to those shown in figures 1 to 4 are designated in the same manner and the previous description is relied upon to describe them.Functional Considerations Which Mav be Required to Meet a Special Need The nucleotide sequences of the viral RNA described above may, in some embodiments of the present invention, be present in the RNA plant virus vector or portion thereof, and are therefore considered an integral part thereof.However, in some embodiments of the present invention, some of these nucleotide sequences may be modified or deleted in part or in whole to meet a particular functional application of the RNA plant virus vector a To meet the functional requirements for the synthesis of a freeformed product not covalently attached to a portion of the coat protein molecule , it may be necessary to delete a part or all of those nucleotide sequences CPG which code for the synthesis of coat protein. flow ever, as shown in figure 5, that nucleotide sequence, designated C, necessary for the control of coat protein synthesis is retained in theRNA plant virus vector while the coat protein gene nucleotide sequence, designated CPG and shown chain dotted thus . , is deleted in part or in whole and is replaced by an RNA nucleotide sequence s e.g. mRNA as shown in figure 5 for directing synthesis of the desired product.b To meet the functional requirements of biological containment due to the nature of the inserted genetic information, it may be necessary to prevent the formation of stable vector particles. As shown in figure 6, to meet this requirement, the nucleation region, designated NR and shown chain dotted thus , may be deleted in part or whole from the RNA plant virus vector or portion thereof. Thus it may be desirable or necessary to delete in part or whole or to otherwise modify certain nucleotide sequences of the RNA plant virus vector or portion thereof to meet specific functional requirements. Such deletions or modifications, however, would not change the nature of the RNA plant virus vector from that which would be gener ally referred to in the art as an RNA plant virus vector or portion thereof.

Also, in step 4, designated 4 , the c v DNA is isolated after alkaline treatment which degrades the V RNA, the c v DNA is then copied using DNA polymerase I P L Biochemicals Inc., Milwaukee, Wisconsin, U.S.A. thus forming a double stranded DNA copy 31,32 of the V nSA, hereinafter referred to as dc V DNA.In step 5, designated commat , the dc V DNA is then appropriately modified in known manner at its ends to form dc NA 34,36 with ligatable linker sequences.Insertion Of The DNA Copy Into Bacterial Plasmids Purified bacterial plasmids e.g. pBR322 BRL in the form of closed circular double stranded DNA designated 38,40 are treated in step 6a, designated G , with the appropriate restriction endonuclease to cleave the plasmid at a single site thus opening the circular plasmid structure to form the structure designated 42,44, with ends complementary to those of the dc V DNA 34,36. For example, restriction endonucleaseEcoRI cleaves pBR322 a single site with the rmcleotide sequenceEMI18.1 In step 6b, designated 6b , after cleavage, the open circular plasmid structure 42,44 and dc V DNA 34,36 are incubated together in the presence of DNA ligase BRL . In the presence of this enzyme, the dc V DNA 34,36 is covalently inserted into the cleaved portion of the plasmid. In step 7a, designated Q , the dc V DNA plasmid 34, 36, 2, 44, is then replicated, selected, and amplified in a suitable strain of bacteria, such as, for example, Escherichia coli E. coli . Insertion Of A DNA Copy Of The Foreign Gene Into The Vector Coat ProteinGene The purified dc V DNA plasmid 34, 36, 42, 44 is treated in step 7b, designated commat , with an appropriate restriction endonuclease to specifically cleave the dc V DNA plasmids 34, 36, 42, 44, in that region of the dc V DNA corresponding to the TMV coat protein gene, designatedCPG. For example, restriction endonuclease Sst I BRL will cleave at the nucleotide sequenceEMI19.1 This sequence occurs twice in the dc V DNA plasmid 34, 36, 42, 44, both sites lying within the TMV coat protein gene.The sites of cleavage are in the nucleotide sequences which code for amino acids 141 143 and 145 147 in the TMV coat protein molecule see Fragment II above for the corresponding sites in the coat protein gene and the following amino acid sequence for the corresponding sites in the TMV coat protein molecule .

After cleaving the coat protein gene of dc V DNA, a dc D7 copy of a gene 46, 48 with gene limits B B , which has been appropriately modified at its 3 ends, is covalently inserted in step 8, designated into the coat protein gene of the dc V DNA using D r A ligase. The plasmid so constructed is allowed in step 9, designated 9 , to replicate in the appropriate bacteria and at the appropriate tine total KNA is extracted from the plasmid infected bacteria.Recovery Of The V RNA Containing An RNA Copv Of The Inserted Gene During replication of the plasmid in the bacteria, plasmiddirected RNA synthesis occurs. Some of the LNA.synthesized in step 9 will include copies of the dc V DNA containing the inserted gene. ThisRNA, designated 50, combines V RNA A A and covalently attached plasmidRNA 5 A and A 3 . This RNA 50 can be specifically isolated by incubation of the total RNA with TMV coat protein, designated 51. The coat protein 51 will bind to and encapsidate only the RNA 50, containing the nucleation region present in V RNA. However, as shown in 10a, the encapsidation may not extend beyond the 3 and 5 ends of the V RNA, thus plasmid RNA beyond these points will not be encapsidated.In this case, the exposed plasmid RNA is removed by nuclease treatment thus producing a particle 51, 52 composed only of V RNA and ISV coat protein. On the other hand, the encapsidation may extend beyond the 3 and 5 ends of the V RNA to include the covalently attached plasmid RNA as shown in 10b . In this case, the V RNA would be recovered when the particle is replicated, as will be described later. A second approach for specific isolation of V nSA from the total RNA extracted from plasmid infected bacteria is to mix in step 10c, the RNA with the dc V DNA recovered from purified dc V DNA plasmids by, for example, Eco RI treatment. This mixture is then heat denatured and allowed to cool slowly during the cooling period, single stranded c V DNA 54 complementary to V RNA will anneal with the V RNA A A portion of RNA 50, 54, thus forming a base paired hybrid cV DNA V RNA. Plasmid RNA, possibly attached to the 3 and or 5 end of the V nSA, will remain single stranded. This single stranded RNA can be degraded using single strand specific nuclease e.g. S1 Nuclease, P L Biochemicals Inc. .After purification, the DNA strand 54 of the c V DNA V RNA hybrid can be degraded with DNAase. The intact V RNA 52 can then be encapsidated withTMV coat protein 51. The V RNA particle 51, 52 corresponds to those recovered by the procedures outlined in 10a above.Replication Of The RNA Vector And Expression Of The Inserted Gene InPlants or Plant Cells, For Example, Tobacco or Tomato Plants or PlantCells V RNA particles produced as a result of the above procedures as shown in 10a and 10c can be engineered to contain the features necessary for replication and expression of the inserted foreign genetic information.Co inoculation in step 11a, designated s , of V RNA par ticles, as shown in 10a and ommat , into plants or plant cells with co plete TMV which will supply the viral replicase will result in replication of the V RNA. Because the inserted genetic information now in the form of RNA lies within the coat protein gene of the V nSA, the productP which the inserted genetic information codes for, will be produced in amounts comparable to that of the coat protein in complete TMV, and also the mode of production of arRNA containing the inserted genetic information will essentially follow that for coat protein m RNA production during replication of complete TMV. When the attached plasmid RNA is also encapsidated during vector particle formation, as in 10b above, if replication occurs, the attached plasmid RNA may be skipped over by the replicase enzyme during and strand synthesis as shown in step lib, designated 9 , and thus the plasmid RNA would be effectively lost to subsequent steps in virus synthesis, or such particles may not be replicated at all, in a manner analogous with that described with re er ence to step 3d and 3e, respectively, in figure 3. Under the former cir cunstances, the replicated V RNA can be functional and direct the expres sion of the inserted foreign genetic information in a manner equivalent to that of the V RNA described above. The latter case will require a different method, such as that described with reference to step 10c, for recovery of the V RNA. Recovery of Bepiicat l RNA Vector Particles fros Infected Tobacco or Tomato Plant or Plant Cells The insertion of the foreign genetic information gene into the coat protein gene of the V RNA will disrupt the continuity of the coat protein gene therefore, the V RNA will not synthesize functional coat protein. However, the co infecting complete TNV will direct the production of function coat protein and both the V RNA and TMV RNA will be encapsidated, forming particles as shown in step 12, designated O The V nSA particles can be isolated by standard procedures and can then be stored for future use in directing the replication and expression of the inserted foreign genetic information gene in plants or plant cells, such as tobacco or tomato. In figures 10 and 11, similar parts to those shown in figures 7 to 9 are designated in the same manner and the previous description is relied upon to describe them.Example IB.

Fragments I and II Generation and Isolation This is carried out in the same manner as has been described for Example IA for Fragment I, designated 60, and Fragment II, designated 62.Reverse Transcription of Fr gments I and II As shown in figure 10, the fragments appropriately printed at their 3 ends with a short complementary oligodeoxynucleotide are reverse transcribed using avian myeloblastosis reverse transcriptase BRL resulting in the synthesis of single stranded DNA copies of Fragments I and II, designated 64 and 66 respectively. The ribo strand is then digested by alkaline treatment. The single stranded DNA copies 64 and 66 are then incubated with DNA polymerase I BRL , in step 1 designa i ted 1 , to synthesis DNA double stranded copies of Fragments I and II, designated 61, 64, and dc Frag. II DNA, designated 63, 66 respectively, and the ends of these DNA copies are appropriately modified.Insertion of the Double Stranded DNA Copies of Fragments I and II intoBacterial Plasmids After modification, the double stranded DNA copies of FragmentsI and II 61, 64, and 63, 66 are inserted in step 2, designated 2 , into separate bacterial plasmids c.g. pBR322 designated 67, 68, and 70, 71, respectively, by procedures analogous to those described in ExampleIA, steps 9 and s using a restriction endonuclease such as, for example Eco RI, to cleave the plasmids. The plasmids are then separately replicated, selected and amplified in the appropriate bacteria such as, for example E. coli.After purification of the plasmids, the double stranded DNA copies of Fragments I and II 61, 64 and 63, 66, respectively, are excised in step 3, designated 3 , from the plasmids using a restriction endonuclease, such as, for example Eco RI. It should be noted that x x represents the limits the double stranded DNA copy of Fragment I, 61, 64, and y y represents the limits of the double stranded DNA copy of Fragment II, 63, 66. DNA DNA Ligation of the Double Stranded DNA Copies of Fragments I and Il After purification, the double stranded DNA copies of FragmentsI and II, 61, 64 and 63, 66, respectively, are then ligated together in step 4, designated 4 , using DNA ligase. The product of the ligation step 4 is designated 61, 64, 63, 66 and is analogous to that in Example IA, step commat 0. The ends of the product 61, 64, 63, 66 are then appropri ately modified in step 5, designated 5 .Insertion of the Ligated Double Stranded DNA Copies of Fragments I and II into Bacterial Plasmids The modified product 61, 64, 63, 66, is then inserted into the appropriate plasmid e.g. pBR322 by procedures analogous to Example IA, steps Q6a and 6b . Procedures analogous to Example IA, steps 0 can now be followed for completion of Vector RNA construction and for replication and expression of Vector RNA in inoculated plants or plant cells such as tobacco or tomato. It should be noted however, the cleavage of the plasmid prior to insertion is accomplished using a different restriction endonuclease to that previously used e.g. Sal 1 . The modified product 61, 64, 63, 66, constructed as described will contain an Eco RI restriction site at the point of ligation if, as has been previously described, Eco RI is used in step 3 . Because of the presence of the Eco RI restriction site the inserted DNA 61, 64, 63, 66, cannot be recovered intact using Eco RI to excise it from the plasmid as in Example IA, step 10 . A Sal 1 site does not occur in the inserted DNA 61, 64, 63, 66, thus the inserted DNA 61, 64, 63, 66, can be excised from the plasmid using this restriction endonuclease. Conversely, if Sal 1 were used initially then, for example, Eco RI could be used at this stage.Insertion of a DNA Copy of Foreign Genetic Information Gene into theVector Coat Protein Gene As in Example IA, steps Recovery of the RNA Vector Containing RNA Copy of the Foreign GeneticInformation tGene As in Example IA, steps commat , s , and Replication of the RNA Vector and Expression of the Foreign GeneticInforamtion Genej in Plants or Plant Cells such as Tobacco or Tomato As in Example IA, steps 11a and 11b .Recovery of Replicated RNA Vector Particles from Infected Plants or PlantCells such as Tobacco and Tomato As in Example IA, step In figures 12 to 15, similar parts to those shown in figures 1 to 9 are designated in the same manner and the previous description is relied upon to describe them.

The ribo strand 102 is then digested in step 2d by alkaline treatment and the DNA copy of the m RNA 104 is then extended in step 3d in the 3 end direction using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase and the appropriate deoxynucleotide triphosphate dNTP to form strand strand 112.The extended DNA strand 112 is then annealed in step 4d with m RNA, designated 110, which has been previously extended at its 3 end using the sane procedure as in the extension of the oligonucleotide 86 as described in step 5b with reference to figure 13, thus forming an nrRNellDNA hybrid 110, 112.Insertion and Ligation of the mrRNA into the Vector RNA Coat ProteinGene The extended Fragment I, designated 92, and the mrRNA DNA hybrid 110, 112 are mixed together in step Sd, figure 15, and incubated with DNA polymerase I and the appropriate ribonucleotide triphosphate rNTP in step 6d. The extended region at the 3 end of Fragment I, designated 92, will anneal with the extended region at the 3 end of theDNA 112 of the hybrid, thus bringing the 3 end of the Fragment I 92 and the 5 end of the wrRNA 110 into alignment the DNA polymerase will fill in the gap between the aligned RNA molecules.DNA ligase is then used in step 7d to covalently ligate the 3 end of Fragment I, designated 92, to the 5 end of the m RNA 110. The DNA 112 of the hybrid is then digested with DNAase. The Fragment I RNA 92, 110 is then mixed in step 8d with the Fragment II RNA DNA hybrid 78, 98, in fig re 14. The extended 3 end of the Fragment I mrRNA 92, 110 and the 5 end of Fragment II 78, are brought into alignment by the extended 3 end of the DNA 98 of the hybrid. DNA polymerase and DNA ligase are then used in step 9d to covalently ligate the 3 end of the Fragment I 3 RNA molecule, designated 92, 110, to the 5 end of the Fragment II 78. DNAase is then used to digest the DNA 98 of the Fragment II RNA DNA hybrid 78, 98.The Fragment I RNA Fragment II molecule V RNA is then encapsidated in step ild with TMV coat protein, designated 112, and inoculated into plants or plant cells in step 12d for replication and expression resulting in the production of at least one gene derived product, designated P, and at least a portion of a vector 92, 110, 78, for, for example, the purposes which will be described later.Replication of the RNA Vector and Expression of the Inserted Gene inPlants or Plant Cells such as Tobacco or Tomato V RNA particles produced according to the present invention, as previously described, can contain the features necessary for replication and expression of the inserted foreign genetic information.This V RNA can also contain the gene for synthesis of the viral ieplicase and therefore be able to replicate in, for example, tobacco without the need of co infection with complete TMV. The V RNA produced in Example I would not contain the replicase gene and thus would require co infection with TMV for replication. Expression of the inserted m RNA foreign gene information can follow the same course as set out in Example I with product yield equivalent to the yield coat protein synthesized during infection of, for example, tobacco with TMV. Note The mode of FragmentI and II production as set forth in this Example II enables more flexibility in that the fragments of any desired length from any location in TMV .nSA can be generated, see, for example, the following fragment which may be produced in this manner EMI32.1 I SEP Frag.I SEP Ex.IA tb SEP tq SEP , SEP t0 tb m7GpppG SEP CAUACACACAGhCACCUAC SEP ExIA SEP SEP tb SEP 110 SEP 130 SEP 150 SEP ,GUCmUArAb SEP 70 tb SEP GA6ACUGUCCGAGCAAACAACU UGGUCAAUGAU SEP CAAGCCGUC SEP UUuCUCAUUACGACA SEP GCCCU tb SEP 490 SEP 210 SEP 230 tb SEP U SEP CAGAACUGCUCGtJUuAACGACCGCAGGCCCAAA6UGAACUUCAAAAGUAAUAACCGAG SEP 3 tb also, this approach allows for the insertion of foreign genetic information into virtually any location within the vector RNA.In Example I, the insertion point is fixed in that only sequences which contain restriction endonuclease sites can be used as insertion points.Recovery of Replicated RNA Vector Particles from Infected Plants or PlantCells such as Tobacco or Tomato As in Example I, insertion of the foreign genetic information into the coat protein gene will prevent the production of functional coat protein, because V RNA produced in Example II will not require co infection with complete mV for viral replicase production, there will not be any functional coat protein produced therefore, V RNA will not be encapsidated into particle form. Recovery of li RNK will require isolation of total RNA followed by incubation with TMV coat protein. The V RNA will be specifically encapsidated by virtue of containing the NR sequences and the V RNA particles formed can be isolated by standard procedures.A different method is to co infect with complete RIV in order to cause formation of vector particles within the plants or plant cells. Particles produced in either manner can be stored for future use in directing the replication and expression of foreign genetic infcrmation in plants or plant cells.

The RNA Vector, constructed as previously described in accordance with the present invention, will direct the replication and expression of the inserted foreign genetic information.Because such insertions can be in the coat protein gene, it follows that the inserted gene product will be synthesized at yields comparable to those of coat protein synthesized by complete TMV during the infection process. Such yields are in the range of 1 10 g coat protein kg fresh weight leaf tissue. Wnile direct comparison of these yields to those obtained in known DNA plasmid bacteria systems cannot be made, the following will give an approximate co parison of expected yields by the two systems RNA Vector in tobacco plants yield of product based on yield of TMV coat protein obtained in tobacco 107 viral particles leaf cell x 103 coat protein molecules viral particle 1010 coat protein molecules cell iso10 coat protein molecules cell x 106 cells g fresh weight leaf tissue 1016 coat protein molecules g leaf tissue 1016 coat protein molecules g leaf tissue x 103 g kg 1019 coat protein molecules kg leaf tissue 1 g coat protein kg leaf tissue DNA plasmid in bacteria yield based on 105 interferon or 105 insulin molecules cell See N.

Hany of the products which have comerctnl application are the products of eucaryotic genes. The expression of these genes in the DNA plasmid bactwria system procaryotic has already presented problems. It ha also been reported that the products of encaryotic genes expressed in bacteria are degraded by bacterial proteases.The RNA Vector plant sysse made possible by the present invention is a eucaryotic system and it therefore follows that it is compatible vith the eucaryotic genes to be inserted, and their products.3. Scme of the products of eucaryotic genes produced in the DNA plas ,Jiac.era system are incomplete. For example, interferon and antibody molecules synthesized in the bacteria system are not glycosylated specific sugar molecules added to the protein . It is believed that such addition occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum system in eucaryotic cells.bacterIa lack such a system but it is present in plant cells.4. The RNA vector system made possibly by the present invention, functions at or near room temperature 250C the bacterial system functions near 37 C. Labile proteins, etc., are likely to be more stable at the temperature used in the RNA vector plant system than in the bacterial systen.5. Often there are toxic or pyrotenic compounds polysaccharides produced by bacteria. Such compounds must be completely removed from the product if it is to be used in humans. There is much less likelihood that similar compounds will be present in the wNA vector plant system nade possible by the present invention.6. The RSA vector according to the present invention is not knoum to be capable of replication in anneal or bacterial cells therefore, it presents a s gnificantly lower biological hazard potential than the DNA plasnid system. The biological containment actor can also be signi.i cantly increased by deletion of the nucleation region necessary for encapsidation. The vector RNA, according to the present invention, can not survive outside the plant cell if not encar sidated by viral protein therefore, the likelihood of inadvertant release is further minimized. The following uses of the present invention are given by way of example 1. The RNA vector plant system made possible by the present invention will have the same scope of potential as the DNA plasmid bacteria system, e.g. the synthesis of proteins, enzymes, antibodies, hormones insulin, somatostatin, growth hormone , nucleotides, polynucleotides, antigenic proteins, anti viral compounds interferon , primary and secondary metabolites. 2. The RNA vector, according to the present invention, may have application in altering the metabolism of plants or plant cells by directing the synthesis of enzymes necessary for the synthesis and accumulation of primary and secondary products in plants or plant cells. 3. The nSA vector, according to the present invention, may have application in altering the metabolism of plants or plant cells, leading to advantageous changes, such as, growth habit, yield potential, energy utilization.4. The RNA vector, according to the present invention, may have direct application in improving disease resistance of plants and improving resistance to environmental stress conditions cold hardiness, increased salt tolerance, etc. .
