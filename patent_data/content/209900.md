# Method and apparatus for measuring the softening point of a vitreous specimen.

## Abstract
The method and apparatus for measuring the softening point of a vitreous specimen detect viscosity variations of the specimen under temperature variations through measurement of mechanical deformations due to the application of a torque. The softening point is found in the temperature interval where the viscosity drops.
