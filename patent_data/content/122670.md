## Abstract
A rasp handle 10 has an elongate body portion 12 with a pistol type grip 14 extending therefrom and rasp retaining structure 16 at its front end. Such structure 16 includes a fixed jaw 22 and a slide jaw 24 constructed and arranged for sliding movement relative to the fixed jaw 22 between a forward closed locking position where a rasp 44 is locked between the jaws 22, 24 and a rearward open rasp receiving and releasing position. A lever 26 is connected to shift the slide jaw 24 between its closed and open positions. A pivot 28 interconnects the lever 26 and the slide jaw 24 so that the lever 26 is free to move between a locked position adja cent the body portion 12 and an unlocked jaw manipulating position away from the body portion 12 .
