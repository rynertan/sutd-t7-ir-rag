# Pressure measuring system.

## Abstract
A pressure measuring system wherein light is transmitted from a light source 3 via a first optical fiber 5 to a pressure receiving diaphragm 1 having a reflecting surface 1a which undergoes a deflection in relation to the pressure being mea sured. The diaphragm 3 reflects light transmitted thereto to a second optical fiber 7 which transmits the reflected light to a first photosensitive element 9a . A reference optical fiber 13 is arranged approximately coextensive to the first and second optical fibers 5,7 and transmits light from the light source 3 in round trip fashion along substantially the same path as light transmitted by the first and second optical fibers 5, 7 to a second photosensitive element 9b . The photosensitive ele ments 9a, 9b produce respective electrical signals which are applied to an operational circuit 15 which eliminates varia tions in the amount of light due to external disturbances by di viding one electrical signal by the other. With such a construc tion, it is possible to have a pressure measuring system which is unaffected by electromagnetic induction accompanying large currents and high voltages, which enables more accurate and more sensitive pressure measurements.
