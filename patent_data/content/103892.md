# Optical recording medium and method of making same.

## Abstract
An optical recording medium for use with a recording apparatus of the type that focuses onto the medium, as the medium is moved in a prescribed fashion, a beam of light that is modulated in intensity in accordance with a data signal to be recorded. The recording medium includes a substrate having a smooth, planar upper surface, with a thin light absorbing coating overlaying the surface, such coating including an explosive material such as nitrocellulose, and a light absorbing dye. As the medium is moved with respect to the intensity modulated beam, the explosive coating is selectively energized by the beam to induce spaced explo sions therein, whereby corresponding optically readable irregularities, representative of the data signal, are formed in the outer surface of the coating. A light reflecting material is then deposited over the coating containing the surface irregularities, and, if desirable, a plastic protective layer is deposited over the light reflecting layer. Two of such mediums can be bonded back to back to form a two sided record.

## Description
OPTICAL RECORDING MEDIUM AND METHOD OF MAKING SAME BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention This invention relates generally to information recording media, and, more particularly, to recording media of the,type in which information can be both recorded and read using optical techniques.Description of the Prior Art Recording media of this particular type have been especially adapted for use both as master discs for subsequent use in the production of replica discs, and for single recording discs that can be readily produced and played back without the stringent controls imposed in connection with the mass produced variety.In both cases, mastering machines can be designed in order that such discs can be directly read while writing so that proper recording can be instantly verified.Further, in both cases, an information signal is typically recorded in such a disc by a light radiation absorption process in which an intensity modulated write beam of light is focused onto the disc as the disc is rotated in a prescribed fashion, thereby changing some characteristic of the disc, such as its reflectivity, in accordance with the information signal. Recording media that can be used as master discs have typically included a glass substrate having a polished upper surface, with a thin coating of either a photoresist material or a metallic material deposited thereon. In the photoresist embodiment, the intensitymodulated writing beam of light functions to expose a sequence of spaced, microscopic areas on the coating, indicative of the information signal being recorded, and a subsequent development of the photoresist material yields a master disc having a sequence of spaced, microscopic pits formed therein.This master disc can then be suitably coated with a thin layer of a metallic material, such as nickel, using an initial step of vacuum deposition by thermal evaporation, followed by a step of electroplating.The metallic layer can then be removed from the master disc to serve as a stamper, with the recorded information signal carried on its underside, for use in a suitable molding apparatus to produce disc replicas. Although generally satisfactory in yielding master discs that can be used in the production of disc replicas, such photoresist recording media have not proven entirely satisfactory for a number of reasons. One reason for this dissatisfaction arises from an inability to read the recorded disc prior to the development step. This precludes a continuous adjustment of the recording apparatus, to optimize various recording parameters such as beam intensity and focus, as the disc is being recorded. Another drawback arises from a difficulty in producing pits in the medium having a diameter of less than about .5 microns, and from the fact that the pits in the disc can sometimes have edges that are ragged and grainy, yielding stampers that can damage the replica discs. Still another drawback arises from the need for an additional step of developing the photoresist material. In the master disc embodiment that includes a thin metallic film, the intensity modulated write beam of light functions to melt a sequence of spaced holes in the film, indicative of the information signal. Although a signal recorded on such a master disc can be read immediately after being recorded, the relatively high thermal conductivity of the metallic film results in the formation of information bearing holes in the film that are larger even than those formed in the master discs having photoresist coatings.This limits the recording density that can be achieved.Additionally, a metallic residue is generally formed around each hole, thereby limiting the signal to noise ratio that can be achieved during playback of the resultant replica discs. Recording media that can be used as single recording discs in direct read after write recording apparatus have typically included thin metallic films overlaying plastic substrates or, alternatively, thin layers of highly light absorptive dielectric materials overlaying substrates having a highly reflective upper surface. Such discs normally further include a member spaced above the coated substrate to protect the coating from dust and abrasion. In direct readafter write recording discs having metallic films, the intensity modulated beam of light functions to melt a sequence of spaced holes in the film, representative of the information being recorded. However, such metallic film recording discs are subject to the same drawbacks mentioned above, regarding metallic film master recording discs, and thus have not proven entirely successful.Specifically, this includes a limiting recording density and a limited signalto noise ratio. In a typical direct read after write recording disc having a dielectric coating, on the other hand, a sequence of spaced microscopic pits is formed in the dielectric coating by evaporation or ablating of the coating. Although the pits can be made somewhat smaller in this medium than in the aforementioned metallic film medium, thereby permitting higher recording densities to be realized, the ablating process nevertheless produces a residue of material surrounding each pit that can adversely affect the signal to noise ratio that can be achieved during playback. An improvement over ordinary dielectric layers subject to the ablative effects of a writing beam is found in U.S. Patent Application ofRichard L. Wilkinson, Serial No. 48,081, filed June 13, 1979 and assigned to the assignee of the present application.In the Wilkinson application a coating of explosive material is substituted for the dielectric layer. When subjected to the heating action of the modulated write beam, the coating is selectively energized by the beam to induce spaced explosions therein, whereby corresponding irregularties, representative of the data signal to be recorded, are formed in the outer surface of the coating. In order to improve the heating efficiency and produce greater resolution in the explosive coating, a dye is added to the coating e.g. nitrocellulose prior to coating the substrate of the recording medium.As a result, the finished product is a recording medium comprising a clear plastic substrate and a pitted dyed information coating. Whether dyed or not, the recorded coating presents an information carrying surface such that the reader device of a player must be designed to distinguish a pit area from a non pit area. Wilkinson proposes the deposition of an intermediate planar mirror like metal layer on the substrate to improve the signal to noise ratio of the read signal. Again here, however, the reflection characteristics of the record medium demand a compatible, non standard, reader.Since mass produced laser videodiscs present a highly reflective metalized information containing surface to a player read head, unfortunately the same player is incapable of reading a Wilkinson type disc without undesirable electro optical modifications. Thus, it will be appreciated that there is a need for a recording disc in which even smaller information bearing surface irregularities can be produced, without the need for a developing step, and without the formation of a residue material or rough edges that can adversely affect the signalto noise ratio that can be achieved during playback of such discs. Similarly, it will be appreciated that there is a need for direct read after write recording disc having even smaller and residue free information bearing surface irregularities, so that higher recording densities and higher signal to noise ratios can be achieved. Finally, in order to make the disc commercially attractive and compatible with players that reproduce mass produced discs, there is a practical need for a disc of the type described above which is additionally able to be played on a standard disc player. These and other needs are fulfilled by the present invention. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Basically, the present invention is embodied in an improved recording medium for use with a recording apparatus of the type that directs onto the medium, as the medium is moved in a prescribed fashion, a write beam of light that is modulated in intensity in accordance with a data signal to be recorded. In accordance with the invention, the recording medium comprises a substrate, with an effective amount of light absorbing coating overlaying the substrate, such coating including an explosive material, wherein as the medium is moved with respect to the intensity modulated write beam, the coating is selectively heated by the beam to induce spaced explosions therein, whereby corresponding irregularities, representive of the data signal, are formed in the outer surface of the coating.These irregularities can be in the form of either pits or upraised bumps, and, additionally, when the irregularities are in the form of pits, they can extend either completely through the coating, or alternatively, only to a prescribed depth therein.A light reflective layer is deposited over the coating containing the surface irregularities resulting in a recording medium that is compatible with players which are designed to play mass produced records. More particularly, recording media in accordance with the present invention are adapted for use as a single unique, one of a kind recording disc and or as direct read after write recording discs.In either case, the recording apparatus with which it is used operates to focus onto the disc, as the disc is rotated at a prescribed angular velocity, an intensity modulated write beam of light and a substantially constant intensity read beam of light.The write beam produces surface irregularities in a layer of explosive material on the disc, and the entire surface, including irregularities, is overlayed with a highly reflective material. The read beam is reflected by the reflective layer on the disc in accordance with the pattern of surface irregularities that is recorded by the write beam. The special light absorbing coating overlaying the substrate can advantageously comprise a layer of an explosive material such as nitrocellulose, trinitroaniline, or trinitrotoluene, all of which will automatically chemically react to produce non condensible gases when selectively heated to a prescribed auto ingition temperature by the focused write beam. The amount of energy from the intensity modulated beam that is absorbed by the coating can be controlled such that the selected portions of the coating on which the beam impinges are either partially or completely exploded.Partial explosions result in the formation of upraised bumps in the outer surface of the coating, whereas complete explosions result in the formation of pits.For explosive materials that are colorless, it is desirable to add to the material a suitable dye that is absorptive of the write beam and that is color stable and will remain in solution with the explosive material. The substrate is preferably a thin plastic disc of glass like amorphous polymer having a smooth planar upper surface, and the surface irregularities formed in the special explosive coating preferably have a depth of at least about 1,000 2. The resultant disc contains a succession of pits or bumps, representative of the data signal, that are narrower than even the l e2 diameter of the focused write beam, whereby an improved recording density can be achieved. In accordance with one aspect of the invention, the coating is deposited on the plastic substrate by initially admixing the explosive material and the selected dye, if required, with a suitable solvent. The resultant liquid solution is then poured on the upper surface of the substrate and the coated substrate is spun at a prescribed angular velocity until the liquid coating has achieved a substantially uniform thickness over the entire surface. Continued spinning at a prescribed angular velocity evaporates the solvent, leaving the special coating at a prescribed thickness. The coating thickness can be controlled by varying the viscosity of the solution and the angular velocity at which the disc is spun. In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a thin, metallic layer, preferably aluminum, is vacuum deposited over the recorded special coating. Because the metallic layer is highly typically 80 or greater reflective, it facilitates a reading of the recorded data signal by the read beam of light, thereby rendering the disc readable by standard laser disc players. Direct read after write DRAW disc recording reproducing systems of the prior art find utility primarily in applications requiring one of a kind or custom recorded programs. For example, in a business that needs quick access to any one of up to 54,000 pages of data that change over a period of time, only one side of a single disc is needed. In this way, new discs can be prepared at regular intervals to reflect current business data. Furthermore, complete control over access to such business records is realized in that monitoring only single copies of each set of data is necessary, and outdated copies can be easily destroyed.As a result of this special application, i.e. the need of only single copies of information data, DRAW machines were designed with specification restraints such as low cost, ease of mastering, and simplicity of operation.Since vacuum deposition is not an in home or inoffice procedure, DRAW machines required playback read heads that would play non standard information surfaces.The present invention, requiring a deposited reflective coating preferrably metal , can perhaps be best suited for discs produced in a low quantity professional production run where one of a kind or proof copies are needed. Since replication is not required, the expense and delays of disc pressing are eliminated. DRAW machine improvements such as those taught in the aforementioned Wilkinson patent application result in greater signal to noise ratios and greater information packing density, due primarily to the use of an explosive data containing coating.However, without a reflective layer, the read head must be of non standard design. Wilkinson also proposes an alternate disc construction which does have a metal layer deposited over the explosive layer. However, such metalized layer is deposited over the explosive layer prior to recording. As a result, the finished product, while a satisfactory improvement over nonmetalized discs, may still be wanting of further improvement due to several unavoidable factors. First, because the metal layer is deposited prior to recording, it is necessary to only partially explode the selected parts of the special coating. This partial exploding causes the special coating to swell and not completely ablate, requiring tight tolerances in the control of the write beam intensity so as to cause at least some explosion but not complete explosion. Morevoer, such partial explosion produces rather rounded bumps as opposed to the well defined sharp edged pits when complete explosion occurs. Finally, since the metallic layer expands with the expanding explosive layer, the degree of reflectivity at each bump site is altered, most likely in a degrading manner, due to the localized spreading of the metal layer over the expanded area of the bump. The aforementioned factors associated with the Wilkinson disc are avoided in the present application by depositing an aluminized reflective layer over the already recorded explosive layer. In this manner, in a process involving complete explosion, well defined pits produce well defined reflective pits or bumps when viewed through the substrate when metalized. Similarly, in a partial explosive process, the metalized bumps are without any reflectivity alteration because the bumps are formed before the metal layer is applied. For discs having a single recording surface, a plastic protective layer is ordinarily deposited over the reflective layer to protect the reflective layer against dust and abrasion. The intensity modulated write beam of light can be directed at the reflective layer either from above, through the protective layer, or from below, through the substrate, the latter being the read mode compatible with standard players. For discs having two recording surfaces, two separate plastic substrates, with metallized and protected special coatings deposited thereon, are bonded together with the protective layer in confronting relationship.In this embodiment, the data signal is read by directing the read beam at the metallized special coating through the appropriate substrate. For embodiments of the recording medium in which the surface irregularities are in the form of upraised bumps, each upraised bump produced in the explosive layer functions to form a corresponding bump in the subsequently deposited overlaying reflective metallic layer. This overlaying metallic layer enhances the reflectivity of the resultant disc, facilitating a reading of the data signal recorded therein with standard laser disc players. Other aspects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, which disclose, by way of example, the principles of the invention. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIGURE 1 is an enlarged cross sectional view not to scale of a recording disc of the present invention, showing an information bearing pit formed in a special explosive coating FIGURE 2 is a completed recording disc of FIGURE 1 inclusive of light reflective and protective layers FIGURE 3 shows a two sided disc comprising bonded disc halves of the type shown in FIGURE 2 FIGURE 4 shows a recording disc similar to that of FIGURE 2 with the pit of a shallower depth and FIGURE 5 is a cross sectional view not to scale of an alternative recording disc of the present invention, showing a metallized and protected information bearing bump formed in the special explosive coating. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Referring now to the drawings, and particularly to FIGURE 1, there is shown an objective lens 6 of a disc recording apparatus not shown for recording a data signal, such as a frequencymodulated video signal or digital signal, on a rotatable recording disc 1. The recording apparatus operates to direct a write beam of light 8 onto the disc 1, as the disc is rotated at a prescribed angular velocity, the beam being modulated in intensity according to a data signal to be recorded. This forms a succession of microscopic information bearing pits 10 or bumps 11 FIGURE 5 , arranged in a plurality of substantially circular recording tracks in a spiral or concentric circle pattern on the disc. The recording apparatus, in a DRAW machine, further operates to focus onto the disc a read beam of light not shown emanating from objective lens 7 in housing 6, having a constant intensity, substantially less than the peak intensity of the write beam 8, to scan the successive pits 10 or bumps 11 immediately after they are formed by the write beam. This permits a continuous control of both the power level and focus of the write beam, so that the signal can be recorded properly over the entire disc. FIGURE 2 is a simplified cross sectional view of a recording disc 1 that can be used with a standard laser playback apparatus. The disc includes a plastic substrate 2 having a smooth planar surface 3 on its upper side, with a thin layer of special lightabsorbing coating 4 deposited thereon. The write beam of light 8 is transmitted through a medium of air adjacent the disc and focused to a diffraction limited spot on the outer surface of the special coating. In accordance with the invention, the special coating 4 is composed of a suitable red transmitting, blue absorbing dye in an ablative binder cellulose nitrate to define an explosive material which is highly absorptive of the intensity modulated blue argon ion writing beam of light 8, whereby as the disc 1 is rotated with respect to the beam, the special coating is selectively energized heated by the beam to induce spaced explosions therein, forming corresponding irregularities in the form of microscopic pits 10 representative of the data signal. The spaced pits 10 are substantially free of any residue material and are free of sharp corners and roughened sidewalls, whereby the signal to noise ratio of the data signals recovered from such discs is of unusually high value.Additionally, the cross sectional size of the pits can be made small relative to the diffraction limited spot of the focused write beam, thereby further increasing the density of the data signals that can be recovered from the disc. The explosive material included in the special light absorbing coating 4 is a substance that will explode or undergo a rapid chemical reaction to produce gases whenever heated to its auto ignition temperature.The coating preferably has a relatively low thermal conductivity, so that only the portions of the coating on which the intensity modulated write beam 8 actually impinges are heated to the critical temperature.Moreover, it is important that the gaseous products df the rapid chemical reaction not condense back onto the coating or onto portions of the recording apparatus after they have cooled. Suitable explosive materials are nitrocellulose, trinitroaniline, and trinitrotolene. The transparent plastic substrate 2 may be of polymethylmethacrylate, transparent amorphous nylon sold under the trademark TROGAMID, or glycholcarbonateDPG CR 39 monomer casting resin. In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the write beam 8 is produced by a conventional argon ion laser, which produces a beam having components at approximately 457, 488, and 514 nanometers, and the optics of the writer are optimized for one of the three wavelengths. Accordingly, to be heated by the intensitymodulated write beam, the coating 39 must be absorptive of these wavelengths. Neither nitrocellulose nor trinitrotoluene in inherently highly absorptive of these wavelengths, so whenever these explosive materials are utilized, the coating further includes a suitable orange or red colored dye that is highly absorptive of the wavelengths. The dye must be color stable and must be readily soluble with the explosive material used.The preferred dye is sold by American Color ChemicalCo. under the trademark AMPLAS ORANGE CR, but other suitable dyes include another dye sold by AmericanColor Chemical Co., this one under the mark ANAPLASTSCARLET MM, and also l phenyl azo 2 napthol and azobenzene 4 azo 2 napthol, sold by DuPont under the marks OIL ORANGE and OIL RED, respectively. The special explosive coating 4 is deposited on the upper surface of the substrate 2 using a special process in which the explosive material and the dye, if required, are initially admixed with a suitable solvent. In the preferred process, ten parts by weight of nitrocellulose, three parts of AMPLAS ORANCE CR dye, and about 300 400 parts of the solvent cellosolve acetate, are combined to yield a solution having a viscosity of about 3 5 centipoise. Other suitable solvents for the explosive material and dye mixture include butyl acetate and amyl acetate. The liquid solution is then poured on the upper surface of the substrate 2, and the coated substrate 2 is then spun at an angular velocity of about 1000 rpm until the solution has achieved a uniform thickness over the entire surface. Continued spinning at about 1000 rpm for about 20 30 seconds evaporates the cellosolve acetate completely, leaving the special coating 4 in the form of a solid solution bonded to the upper surface of the substrate. The thickness of the coating 4 can be controlled by varying the viscosity of the solution and or the spin speed. A final thickness of about 1300 1400 i is preferred, because the pits 10 that are thereafter formed in the coating will have a corresponding depth, thereby enhancing the readability of the disc.More specifically, 1300 1400 has been found optimum for best performance of a disc playback apparatus employing a conventional helium neon laser having a wavelength of 6328 It has been found that for a coating 4 having this prescribed thickness and having the prescribed relative proportions of nitrocellulose and the specified dye, microscopic pits having a width of about .3 microns are formed by a write 2 beam 8 that is focused to a e2 diameter of about .5 microns and that has a peak power of about 20 milliwatts for 50 nanoseconds. It is believed that since the write beam 8 impinges on a selected location on the disc 1 for a time period of less that about 100 nanoseconds, and since the coating 4 has a relatively low thermal conductivity, the spaced explosions are confined to the portions of the coating that are actually illuminated by the beam.It will be appreciated that for coatings that are proportionately more or less absorptive of the write beam, the intensity of the beam must be correspondingly lower or higher to achieve the same results. After the pattern of microscopic pits 10, representative of the data signal, has been formed in the disc 1, a metallic overlayer 12 is suitably deposited onto the recorded coating 4. The metallic overlayer 12 provides a highly light reflective character to the formed pits in the coating 4 so as to improve the quality of the retrieved data by a read beam 20 which can be directed to impinge the metallic layer 12 from above or from below the disc. One suitable technique for depositing the metallic overlayer includes an initial step of vacuum depositing by thermal evaporation a 200 2 layer of aluminum directly onto the upper surface of the information bearing coating 4. The recorded data signal is readable on the underside of the disc in the form of bumps or on the upperside of the disc in the form of pits, which correspond to the pits 10 of the disc shown in FIGURE 1, and which will likewise be free of sharp corners and grainy sidewalls and are only approximately .3 microns in width. A protective layer 16 of plastic material, such as that sold under the trademark Neocryl A601 can be deposited overlaying the light reflective layer 12 to protect layer 12 against dust and abrasion which could result in subsequent handling of a freshly recorded disc. Moveover, such a protective layer is vital when bonding two disc halves together to form a double sided disc. The protective layer 16 may be any suitable plastic like coating that is inert relative to the type of bonding adhesive used and to the type of metal preferably aluminum used to form the light reflective layer 12. FIGURE 3 depicts another embodiment of a disc in accordance with the present invention, wherein the disc includes two information bearing surfaces.The disc includes two plastic substrates 2 with a special light absorbing coating 4 deposited on each substrate. A light reflective layer 12 is deposited over each recorded explosive layer 4, and each lightreflective layer 12 is covered with a layer 16 of protective plastic. A bonding adhesive 24, such as that sold under the trademark Pliobond, is shown joining the two disc halves. In yet another embodiment of a recording disc in accordance with the present invention, and having reference to FIGURE 4, the explosive coating 4 is substantially thicker than those shown in the embodiments shown in FIGURES 1 3, preferably having a thickness greater than about one micron, and the surface irregularities are in the form of pits that extend only partially into the top surface of the coating 4. The intensity modulated write beam 8 is focused onto the top surface of the coating from above the disc. Because the depth of focus of the beam is limited to about .2 microns, however, the focused beam begins to diverge a short distance beneath the surface. As a result, the intensity of the beam is sufficiently high to heat the explosive material to its autoignition temperature only within about .4 to .6 microns of the upper surface. FIGURE 5 is simplified cross sectional view of an alternative disc 1 in accordance with the present invention. The disc 1 is identical in structure to the disc 1 of FIGURE 2, except that it is adapted to absorb less energy from the intensity modulated write beam of light 8. In this embodiment, the bumps are formed by subjecting the layer 4 to the write beam from beneath, i.e.in the position of the read objective shown inFIGURE 5. For a coating 4 having the same composition as that specified for the coating of FIGURE 2, the intensity modulated write beam 8 need have a power level of only about one milliwatt. As a result, there is sufficient energy to induce only incomplete explosions in the spaced areas on the coating that are illuminated by the scanning write beam, whereby an upraised bump 11 is formed at each such area. It is believed that each upraised bump results from a trapping of gases produced in the rapid chemical reaction that occurs in the coating when heated by the write beam. The read beam of light 20 emerging from objective lens 19 in housing 18 has a constant intensity that is insufficient to heat the explosive coating to its auto ignition temperature, primarily due to the low absorption characteristics of layer 4 at the read beam wavelength, so it does not produce any irregularities in the outer surface of the coating 4. Thus, in the disc of FIGURE 2, when the read beam impinges on portions of the disc 1 not occupied by a pit, it is transmitted through the coating 4 and reflected by the underlying metallic reflective payer 12 back to the objective lens 19. When it is focused on a pit 10, on the other hand, it is reflected by the metallic layer 12, but due to the small size of the pits relative to the wavelength of the read beam, it is diffracted or scattered by the pit and only a small proportion of it is collected by the objective lens.This is especially the case when a lens with a relatively low numerical aperture is utilized. Thus, the reflected beam collected by the objective lens is modulated in intensity by the recorded pattern of pits. In similar fashion, when used with the disc 1 of FIGURE 5, the read beam of light is reflected back to the objective lens 19 whenever it impinges on a portion of the explosive coating 4 not occupied by an upraised bump 11, but is scattered by diffraction whenever it impinges on such a bump. Thus, the reflected beam collected by the objective lens is similarly modulated in intensity by the recorded pattern of bumps. Appropriate electro optical arrangements for recording and playing back data signals can be found in any of a variety of prior art documents, such as the aforementioned Wilkinson application and U.S. Patent No. 4,225,873 to John S. Winslow. The explosive layer 4 may, if desirable, have a thickness of about 10,000 i, so that effects the solvent might have on the underlying plastic substrate will have less effect on the upper portion of the coating, where information bearing irregularities are to be formed. Alternatively, there is advantage in ablating pits in a substantial ablative layer, e.g. when flat pit bottoms are undesirable. From the foregoing description, it should be apparent that the present invention provides an improved information recording medium for use in both one of arkind recording apparatus and direct read after write recording apparatus, wherein the completed product includes a lightreflective metalized layer, deposited after recording, overlaying a special coating in which very small surface irregularities in the form of optically readable bumps or pits has been formed. The special coating includes an explosive material and the surface bumps or pits can be formed therein without the formation of any substantial residue material or any rough edges that could adversely affect the playing characteristics of the disc. As a result, data signals can be recorded in the medium with a very high signal to noise ratio, and the disc can be played back on a standard laser reading videodisc player. Although the invention has been described in detail, it will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that various modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, it is not intended that the invention be limited, except as by the appended claims.
