## Description
DIGITAL PHASE DETECTOR The present invention relates to digital phase detectors and more particularly to a digital phase detector suitable for use with a digital type ultrasonic holography apparatus. The detailed construction of the digital type ultrasonic holography apparatus is disclosed in theJapanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 8584 79.According to the above digital type ultrasonic holography apparatus, clock pulses reference wave are produced at intervals of a predetermined period of time, ultrasonic pulses are generated in synchronism with pulses which are produced by dividing the frequency of the clock pulses, coincidence in time phase coincidence between the reflected wave pulses object modified wave received during a predetermined gate period of time and the clock pulses reference wave is examined, and then a coincidence pulse is produced when they coincide with each other thereby to produce a hologram by the coincidence pulse. In this apparatus, when the phase difference between the reference wave and the object modified wave is, for example, 0 to Tr radian, a binary digit 11111 is produced, and when it is IT to 2s radian, a binary digit 0 is produced. Therefore, the change of the phase i.e. the amplitude of interference waves or the intensity thereof depending on the phase difference can be detected only when the phase difference is within the range of 0 to IT. It is an object of the invention to provide a digital phase detector capable of detecting the phase difference between the reference wave and the objectmodified wave with high accuracy. It is another object of the invention to provide a digital phase detector capable of detecting the phase difference between the reference wave and the object modified wave with high accuracy irrespective of the frequency of the reference wave or object modified wave. It is still another object of the invention to provide a digital phase detector capable of detecting the aforementioned phase difference with high accuracy even when the pulse duration of objectmodified wave is short. In accordance with the present invention, plural kinds of clock pulses are utilized for producing a binary code indicative of time function of interference wave intensity, and upon reception of object modified wave pulse, the binary code at this time is outputted so that the interference wave intensity can be indicated by digital pulses. Other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of preferred embodiment thereof taken in conjunction with accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a time chart for illustrating the principle of the present invention in which only reference waves are shown by actual waveforms Fig. 2 shows the intensity of the interference wave with respect to a period of time, td at which the object modified wave is received Fig. 3 is a block diagram of a preferred embodiment of the present invention Fig. 4 is a time chart for illustrating the waveforms of input and output at each part of the digital phase detector shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 5 is a specific circuit arrangement of the digital phase detector shown in Fig. 3. The principle of the present invention will first. be described with reference to Figs. 1 and 2. The present invention employs a plurality of clock pulses as reference signals. These clock pulses have, for example, different periodicity and pulse duration as shown in Fig. 1 by signals Eot E and E2. The amplitude of the positive sine wave as indicated by signal J is represented by digital values of three bits as a binary code 001 , 1101011, 011 , LOO or the like which is obtained by the combination of the clock pulses Eot E1 and E2. As disclosed in the Japanese Patent Appli cation Laid Open No. 8584 79 a coincidence is examined between the plurality of reference waves and the objectmodified wave, i.e., if the reference wave is in a predetermined state upon reception of object modified wave, a coincidence signal is outputted as indicated by signal D in Fig. 1. The digital value No represents the interference intensity. Fig. 1 is a waveform diagram to which reference is made for illustrating the principle of the present invention, and hence the signal K is different from the actual waveform. Fig. 2 shows the relationship between a point of time when the object modified wave is received, or delay time td and the intensity signal K of interference wave. Referring to Fig. 2, although the signal K is positive, the intensity of the negative interference wave can be outputted in digital value by using code bit signal as well. Fig. 3 is a block diagram of a preferred embodiment of the invention, in which a digital phase detector 10 includes a multiple clock pulse generator 1, a waveform shaping circuit 2, and a time coincidence circuit 3. In addition, numeral 20 designates a flaw detector including an ultrasonic transducer.The multiple clock pulse generator 1 generates a time reference pulse L for determining the time origin and clock pulses Eg, E1 and E2 as shown in Fig. 1 seeFig. 4 . This time reference pulse L controls the time interval of the transmission pulse generated from the flaw detector 20. The waveform shaping circuit 2 is supplied with an object modified wave B from the flaw detector 20 so as to produce a digital pulse M ofTTL level 11111 during the pulse width of signal B or above in synchronism with the leading edge of the signal B.The time coincidence circuit 3 receives a bit signal E from the multiple clock pulse generator 1 and holds the level of the bit signal E at the time of leading edge of the pulse signal M from the waveform shaping circuit 2 for the pulse width of the pulse signal M, which level is outputted as an interference intensity signal K . The operation waveforms at each part of the embodiment of Fig. 3 are shown inFig. 4. A signal L is a time reference pulse indicating the time origin, which is used to generate a ultrasonic pulse in synchronism with the leading edge of the signal L. The signals Eg, El and E2 are clock pulses from the multiple clock pulse generator 1 and correspond to a bit signal of three bits. The signal B is a reflected wave . object modified wave signal which is supplied from the external flaw detector 20 to the waveform shaping circuit 2 where it is converted to the digital pulse signal M.The signal K is a three bit digital signal obtained by holding the level of the signal E at the time of leading edge of the signal M and during a period of time corresponding to the pulse width of a signal M. Fig. 5 is a circuit diagram of the time coincidence detector 3. The time reference signal L is applied to a monostable multivibrator 31 where it delayed. This delayed signal is applied to a monostable multivibrator 32, which produces at its Q terminal a gate pulse TGp of duration Tw after a GP predetermined period of time TD has elapsed from the application of signal L thereto. The period of timeTD is determined by the value of a resistor 33 and a capacitor 34 constituting the monostable multivibrator 31, and the duration Tw is also determined by the value of a resistor 35 and a capacitor 36 of the monostable multivibrator 32.The Q output of the multivibrator 32 is applied to a monostable multivibrator 37, which then produces a gate end pulse PGE of duration tw in synchronism with the leading edge of the time gate pulse. On the other hand, the object modified wave signal M is applied to a 4 bit synchronous counter 38 which is connected with a switch 39 and resistor 40 for setting to an initial value data. In this embodiment, the initial value data is set to with hexadecimal numbers, and the timing for setting is at the leading edge of the negative logic pulse from a NOT gate 41 to which the signal L is applied.The CARRY signal from the synchronous counter 38 is outputted in synchronism with the leading edge of the object modified signal M. However, the CARRY signal is not produced unless the object modified signal M is the NF th pulse during the time gate pulse where 1 NF 16 . The switch 39 in Fig. 5 is set to be N F 1. Depending on what value the switch 39 is set to, the N F th pulse alone of the maximum of 16 pulses in the signal M for the duration of the time gate pulse TGp can be extracted as a CARRY signal.The CARRY signal from the synchronous counter 38 is applied to a D type edge triggered flip flop 42, which produces at the Q terminal a 0 level when the CARRY signal occurs for the duration of the time gate pulse, or 1 level when the CARRY signal does not occur.The output signal from the flip flop 42 and the gateend pulse from the Q terminal of the monostable multivibrator 37 are applied to an AND gate 43, which produces a logic product signal. This signal is applied to the clear terminal of a D type edgetriggered flip flop 44. The three bit signal to the flip flop 44 is a signal E from the multiple clock pulse generator 1. The flip flop 44 latches the signal E three bits at the time of the CARRY signal from the synchronous counter 38 and produces interference wave intensity signals K9ot K 1, K 2 3 bits at terminals lQ to 3Q.In either cases where the object modified signal M is not outputted during a predetermined period of time after the time reference signal L has been produced i.e. for the duration of the time gate pulse or the number of pulses is below N F to which the switch 39 is set , the signals K K 1, K 2 is cleared to zero at the trailing edge of the time gate pulse even during the period of time when the signal M is outputted. The reference signal wave and object modified signal wave do not necessarily have the same period, and the interference wave intensity can fully be detected. even though the pulse width of the objectmodified signal wave is short. While in the above embodiment clock pulses with different periodicity and pulse duration are used as reference signals which form a binary code, clock pulses with the same periodicity and pulse duration but different phase may be employed. That is, these clock pulses, when summed, may form substantially a sawtooth wave or a triangular wave.
