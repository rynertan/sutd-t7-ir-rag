# Atomic absorption spectrophotometer providing background correction using the Zeeman effect.

## Abstract
An atomic absorption spectrophotometer having a source e.g., a hollow cathode lamp 30 , of spectral radiation of a selected narrow band of wavelengths optically directed along an axis through an electrothermic sample atomizer 42 and a field 50 stop to a photoelectric detector 62 . The sample atomizer 42 is subjected to a substantially unipolar AC electromagnetic field having flux lines directed transversely to said axis to effect Zeeman splitting of the radiation into two orthogonally polarized components π and α. Disposed in the optical path between the atomizer and detector is a stationary beam splitting polarizer prism 50 oriented so as to transmit the α polarized component and block the π component. Mirrors are used exclusively in the optical systems so as to minimize the effect of dispersion and stray light. An electromagnet 56 , used to generate the electro magnetic field, is connected to the AC power line in series with the diode 68 and has a small capacitor 70 connected across its coils 64 . This causes the magnetic field at the sample atomizer to vary sinusoidally from a maximum value of one polarity to a very small value of the opposite polarity. The polarizer prism 50 is of unique design in which one polarization passes through undeviated on the optical axis
