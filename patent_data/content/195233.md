# Method of making apparel.

## Abstract
A method of forming and attaching sleeves to a garment, particularly an isolation gown is disclosed. The garment is constructed from a generally rectangular body portion and two sleeve portions. The body portion is cut and folded to form a straight line on each side and the sleeve portions are attached to the body on the straight line and then folded. The sleeve edges are then joined together to form the garment.
