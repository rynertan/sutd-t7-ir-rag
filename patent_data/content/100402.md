# PRINTING APPARATUS AND PROCESS

## Abstract
A printing apparatus is disclosed wherein rocking mo tion of a movably mounted inking roll assembly 30 is controlled by a cam 60 and follower 78 arrangement coupled to the drive system for a pivoting printing member. The cam and follower arrangement allows coordinated movement of the printing member 28 and inking roll assembly 30 to be obtained in a simple manner and without employing separate drive means for rocking the inking roll assembly. The cam contour is advantageously chosen so that the inking roll 69 is moved gradually toward and then away from the pivot axis of the printing member 28 as the line of contact between the printing element 37 and the inking roll 69 progresses from the leading edge of the printing element to the trailing edge. Such movement of the inking roll 69 maintains uniform tangential contact between the inking roll 69 and the entire surface of a flat printing element 37 as the latter is moved in an arcuate path by the printing member 28 . Also disclosed is a resilient mounting arrangement for the printing member 28 which allows movement of the printing member 28 along separate arcuate and straight line paths at different times under the control of a single drive means.
