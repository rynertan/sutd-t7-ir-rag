# Unitized fuel injection system.

## Abstract
A unitized fuel injection system having a common fuel rail 10 , a fuel pressure regulator 18 permanently attached to one end of the fuel rail 10 and a plurality of fuel injector valves 20 having progressive die formed housings 80 per manently attached to the fuel rail 10 . Each fuel injector valve 20 embodies a light weight movable valve member 110, 116 electromechanically actuated by a solenoid coil assem bly 126 , a stationary valve member 102 having a conical valve seat 106 and a metering plate 98 having a metering orifice 100 . The movable valve member 110, 116 has an armature 116 and a valve stem 110 having a spherical end surface mating with the conical valve seat 106 . The dis placement of the movable valve member 110, 116 is suffi cient to allow the fuel flow to be controlled by the size of the metering orifice 100 and virtually independent of the posi tion of the valve stem 110 . Design of the fuel injector valve 20 is directed to minimize machining operations of the valve s component parts.
