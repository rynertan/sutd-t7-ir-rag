## Description
The present invention relates to methods and systems for preparing a thermoplastic sack, and, more particularly, to methods and systems for preparing such a sack having at least a substantially flat rectangular bottom. One type of bag contemplated for preparation by a system and process of the present invention is more particularly defined in our copending European Patent Application No. 85303049.2. The bag structure of that patent application is of a thermoplastic film material and it comprises front and rear bag walls connected by gusseted side walls. The bag has an open mouth top portion, which is characterized by having handles located at opposite end regions thereof, said handles each being of two films as a result of being integral extensions of said front, rear and gusseted side walls. The bag has a bottom wall planarly extensible so as to form a rectangle with at least no substantial excess film outside of the bulk volumetic capacity of the bottom region of said bag. By no substantial excess is meant no excess over that necessary to form seam seals. An alternative manner of describing the bottom of such a bag is that said bottom is formed from integral extensions of said front, rear and side walls and the closure thereof is 4 two film, gusset to wall heat seals, when said bottom is a square, and 4 two film, gusset to wall heat seals and 1 two film, front wall to back wall heat seals when said bottom is a rectangle. The present invention also contemplates forming the same type of bag without handles. The present invention is concerned with the method for preparing an at least substantially flat, rectangular bottom thermoplastic flexible film sack comprising The present invention is also concerned with the method for preparing a handled, at least substantially flat, rectangular bottom thermoplastic flexible film sack comprising For a pack of such bags, a tab member is an integral extension of the bag mouth opening and each tab member has a pre weakened region, such as perforations therein so that when all tabs are fastened together, individual bags may be detached from the tab structure. Figure 1 is a plan view, in schematic form, illustrating a system and process sequence of one form of the present invention. Figure 2 is a plan view of another form of the process and system of the present invention. In Fig. 1, there is illustrated a system and process sequence 50 for forming a handleless, gusseted, flat bottomed thermoplastic sack. In this process, a hollow cylinder or tube of thermoplastic film 12, formed by inflation thereof just after extrusion, is in the process of being collapsed by being passed through a collapsing and gusset forming means 14. The tube is prepared by means well known in the art for bubble forming thermoplastic film. The device 14 can be of any construction which accomplishes the steps of collapsing the tube and forming oppositely disposed gussets therein. Device 14 can be a sheet metal device which has an entrance side for receiving a flexible tube of cylindrical film. Sheet metal plates therein cause an infolding or gusseting of any desired dimension from a fraction of an inch to several inches e.g. about 3 inches, to be fashioned in the structure as the tube passes therethrough. The exit dimension progressively diminishes to present a fully collapsed gusseted tube. Dotted lines 16 illustrates an example of the extent of infolding of the oppositely disposed gussets. The collapsed, lay flat, gusseted tube progresses to a station 18 which thermally impresses a seal line 20 between the front and rear panels of the collapsed gusseted tube, transversely across the mid section of said collapsed tube between the spaced apart gussets. This thermal seal does not sever the two films. Simultaneously or subsequently a coextensive, pre weakened transverse line 22 next closely adjacent and parallel to said transverse sealed seam 20 is effected. A convenient manner of forming a pre weakened transverse line is by forming a line of perforations by any piercing means through the layers of film. Instead of being coextensive this preweakened line 22 can extend across the full width of the tube. The seamed and pre weakened gusseted tube thereafter traverses two plates 24, each of which extend into the full reach of the gusset 16. These plates can be coated with some suitable non stick material to prevent molten thermoplastic polymer from adhering to it. Thereafter, four triangular sections are removed from the gusseted tube. The triangular sections are removed by means which will result in leaving a sealed and severed line 26 and a cut line 28 on both sides of the collapsed tube. The severance and seal line 26 is best effected by a Teflon coated resistance wire heated to a temperature which will melt through and seal along line 26. A cutting member simulaneously or subsequently will sever each gusset fold along line 28 for a distance equal to the depth of the gusset fold. By this action, two pairs of superimposed triangular sections of film, on each side of the gusseted tube, will be removed from the tube. The triangular members are bounded by line 26, 28 and the included side edge of the tube. The four removed sections will be returned for recycling with any other scrap film. The result of this action will yield handless bags interconnected along pre weakened line 22 and effectively bottom sealed with lines 20 and 26. These interconnected bag structures may be rolled upon themselves to form a cylindrical package. Alteratively, they may be collected in a zig zag folded stack arrangement. In both cases the collected interconnected bags are ready for individual severance and use. The bags also may be individually separated and folded or stacked. In forming severance and seal line 26, it is important that seal line 26 touches or overlaps the ends of seal line 20 in order to ensure a series of bottom seal lines that do not contain gaps. It is preferred that seal line 26 touch and pass beyond the ends of seal line 20 and extend to pre weakened line 22. Seal and severance line 26 is a diagonal line which extends over the portion of the tube width corresponding to the gussets along lines diagonal to the length of the tube and the seal pairs of opposite sides of the collapsed tube are at an angle to one another, preferably at an angle of at least approximately 90 . The seams of each pair of seams on each side of the gusseted tube are in registration with one another. In other words, beneath seam 26, and on the other side of Teflon coated separator plate 24, there is an identical seal line 26. As an alternative to the process and system illustsrated in Figure 1, the four triangular sections adjacent to seals 26 can be removed subsequent to the formation of seal line 26. In this alternative preweakened line 22 is formed across the full width of the tube. Seal lines 26 are then formed so as to bond the gusset folds together but not sever them. The structures are then separated and stacked to a predetermined count, e.g. 100, so that all tops and all bottoms are in registration. Finally, the four triangular double fold sections beyond or outside of the seal lines 26 are removed by any suitable means, e.g. a cutting member. The result is a stack of handleless bags which can be gusset expanded to yield a flat bottom. In a preferred embodiment of the process and system illustrated in Fig. 1, a linear low density polyethylene tubular film 12 of about 0.75 1 mil. in thickness is collapsed and simultaneously gusseted by passing through a gusset forming means 14. This action then folds the collapsed tube to yield gussets 16. As the gusseted tube progresses through the system, seal line 20 and perforated line 22 are simultaneously formed. Thereafter, triangular regions bounded by sever and seal lines 26, severance line 28 and the outer edge of the gusset, are removed from the collapsed tube. Following this, bag blanks 40 can be convolutely wound into a roll of bags, interconnected at pre weakened lines 22. Alternatively, the bag blanks can be separated along line 22 and stacked for packaging and for use. As indicated in Fig. 2, 50a illustrates a system and process sequence for forming a handled, gusseted, flat bottomed flexible thermoplastic sack and sack pack. As in Fig. 1, a tube of thermoplastic film is collapsed to a lay flat condition so as to have gussets 16 formed therein. The gusseted tube progresses to a station 30 where seal line 20 is impressed between the front and rear panels of the collapsed tube, as in Fig. 1. Simultaneously or subsequently, a coextensive pre weakened transverse line 22 is effected closely next adjacent to, and parallel to said transverse sealed seam 20. Again, subsequently or simultaneously to the formation of seal 20 and line 22, a seal line 32 is formed across the full width of the gusseted collapsed tube. Seal line 32 is of the same type as 20 in that it seals but does not sever the films. Ultimately, seal 32 will be the seal in the handle loops of the finished bag. Thereafter, as in Fig. 1, the gusseted portion of the tube traverses two Teflon coated plates 18. As in Fig. 1, four sealing and severing seams are diagonally formed in the gusset region and the Teflon coated plates prevents severed lines 26 from sticking to each other. Simultaneously or subsequently, four severing lines 28 sever the gusset folds along lines which are extensions of said pre weakened line 22. This action removes four double thickness triangular regions from the gusset area at the bottom of the bag blank beyond or outside of seals 26. At this point, the bag bottoms are effectively sealed but still interconnected to the top of an adjacent bag blank. The bag blanks can then be severed along pre weakened line 22, stacked to a height of 50, 75, 100, etc., and a suitable handle and bag mouth fashioned through the stacked blanks to yield a pack of bags. As shown by 34 of Fig. 2, the bag handles and bag mouth opening can have a variety of shapes. The plurality of bags may be fastened together, for example, at a tab 36, as shown in Fig. 2. A convenient means of fastening the bags together at each tab pair, is by ultrasonic, thermal welding. Individual bags can be torn from the pack along lines such as that illustrated by pre weakened line 38 of Fig. 2. The bag packs also can have an orifice in each tab 36 to accommodate suspension of a bag pack. This will complete the formation of a handled sack, the bottom of which can be planarly extended so as to have a flat bottom. By planarly extended is meant that the bag is extended in internal volume to its utmost by expanding the gussets fully, thereby forming a flat bottom, rectangular in nature, having a length greater than its width. As an alternative to the process and system illustrated in Figure 2, the four triangular sections adjacent to seals 26 can be removed subsequent to the formation of seals 26. In this alternative, preweakened line 22 is formed across the full width of the tube. Seal lines 26 are then formed so as to bond the gusset folds together but not sever them. The structures are then separated and stacked to a predetermined count, e.g. 100, so that all tops and all bottoms are in registration. The four triangular double fold sections beyond or outside of seal lines 26 are removed by any suitable means, e.g., a cutting member. Simultaneously or subsequently, at the opposite end of the stack, a suitable die cutting member can remove part of the stack so as to form a pair of handles, a bag mouth opening and a suitable tab member as shown at 34, 36 and 38. In a preferred process, stacks of structures would be assembled as described immediately above with the triangular sections are still attached with the following modification. After each structure is separated from its succeeding structure it is stacked in registration and bonded to its preceeding structure. The bonding is effected with hot needles which pierce through the top structure at least to the next structure molt bonding each structure melt bonding each structure to the adjacent structure. The details of this technique is disclosed in copending application Serial Number 404,175, filed August 2, 1982. This application is incorporated herein by reference, in its entirety. The hot pin bonding is effected in an area which will ultimately be removed during handle and bag mouth forming. This hot pin bonding insures stack registration stability during stack movement as the remainder of the process is carried out. Thereafter, the stack is permanently bonded together, by any suitable means in an area which will ultimately become the suspension and tear off region of the pack. After bonding, either simultaneously or sequentially the triangular sections are removed, as by cutting and the handles bag mouth opening, and intermediate tab region 36 are formed by an appropriate die cutting member. During this action or subsequently, a suspension orifice is formed closely adjacent to and above the point of bonding in the tab region. At the same time or thereafter, the preweakening can be formed in the tab area above the lowest amplitude of the stress relief areas at the base of handles 34. The resulting bag pack will be similar to a stack of bags produced as in Figure 2 but having common bonding in tab area 36, an adjacent suspension orifice and a preweakened tear off line 38. Bags of the structures described can be formed by employing any suitable thermoplastic material, for example, a polyolefin film. In employing the term polyolefin , it is used generically to include all polymer species, including, for example, low density polyethylene, linear low density copolymers of ethylene and another alpha olefin, high density polyethylene, mixtures and blends of the same, and other monomer counterparts, etc. The bag film can be of any gauge, for example, from about 0.3 to about 5 mils in thickness. In forming the flat bottomed bag, it is preferred that the angle between the diagonal seal line and the bottom seal be at least approximately 135 when said bag is in its lay flat condition. It is also preferred that the open mouth portion of the handled sacks of the present invention have stress relief curves or arcs extending from the base of the handle to a raised portion of the bag mouth. This will militate against splitting or tears occurring in the bag mouth during handle extension or when the bag is being filled with any bulky material. The handles and bag mouth opening can have any configuration. In forming the bag structure, the pertinent angles need not be precise, e.g., exactly 90 , 45 , or 135 . Reasonable processing latitude should permit some deviation from these guidelines. Likewise, in forming seal seams, the ends thereof can be curved or angled in order to accommodate or ensure good closure at all film interfaces and joints. Double or plural line seams and seals are also contemplated.
