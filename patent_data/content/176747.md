# Silicon semiconductor substrate with an insulating layer embedded therein and method for forming the same.

## Abstract
A silicon semiconductor substrate includes an insulating layer embedded therein. The silicon semiconductor subs trate 20 comprises a first silicon plate 21 , an insulating layer 23 embedded in the first silicon plate so that the surfaces of the silicon plate and the insulating layer are in a mirror surface, and a second silicon plate 22 united with the first silicon plate and the insulating layer at the mirror surface of the first silicon plate and the insulating layer. The insulating layer 23 is used for forming an isolated region in the second silicon plate.
