# Exposure control circuit for the light source of a camera.

## Abstract
In a light source apparatus for a fiberscope, a xenon lamp 36 for producing light of a required dose for illuminating a scene to be photographed through a light guide 10 during the presence of a synchronizing signal, an integrating circuit 50, 56 for integrating light reflected from the scene accord ing to the synchronizing signal, a comparator 60 for produc ing a coincidence signal when the output signal of the integ rating circuit 50, 56 coincides with a predetermined signal, a rotary solenoid 88 energized according to the coincidence signal from the comparator 50, 56 and a shutter plate 42 mounted on a shaft of the rotary solenoid 88 and serving to prevent light from the xenon lamp 36 from entering the light guide 10 when the solenoid 88 is energized are provided. Further, the light source means comprises a feedback circuit 68, 72 for supplying the output signal of the comparator 60 through a positive feedback path to the integrating circuit 50, 56 to saturate the output signal thereof.
