## Description
Auxiliary device in a supporting means adapted for securing a surf board on the roof of a motor vehicle. The invention relates to an auxiliary device in supporting means adapted for securing a surf board on the roof of a motor vehicle. Such means, generally named imperial are known in many embodiments. They mainly comprise two supporting beams extending in the supporting position transversely along the top of the vehicle roof front and aft and connected at their ends by means of supporting clamps to the roof edges. The surf board is secured to the supporting beams by means of lash straps with its top directed downwardly and thereby having its nose tip pointing slightly downwardly.When driving with a thus supported surf board substantial forces may occur which tend to move the board out of its position. In the first place a lift force arises which nevertheless the fact that the board is supported having its nose tip, which extends forwardly a relatively long distance beyond the roof, pointing downwardly, may be rather substantial and terrds to simply lift the board from the roof. In the second place the forces acting in the horizontal plane which occur during bbraking and accelerating respectively of the vehicle tend to shift the board forwardly and backwardly respectively. The said lash straps generally offer a sufficient guarantee against unwanted lifting during driving and particularly also if said straps have been tightened somewhat less strongly.However, such straps straps areless reliable where it concerns securing the board in the driving direction. If the lash straps has been insufficiently tightened the danger is very much present that the board rushes forwardly between the lash straps when the vehicle is suddenly aked and that the board damages the surroundings. The invention aims at removing this disadvantage without impairing the easy loading and unloading of the surf board. This purpose is achieved according to the invention by an auxiliary device constituted by a r3d t like element upstanding from the supporting surface of the supporting means, the upper end of said element corresponding to the extremity of a mast foot, the arrangement being such that the rod like element fits with a snap in connection or slidingly respectively in the recessed bore for the mast foot in the board in a manner corresponding to that for the mast foot. When supporting the surf board on the roof of a vehicle provided with a supporting means according to the invention it is imperative that the upwardly projecting rod like element snaps into the recessed bore for the mast foot.After the provision of the lash straps then the board not only is locked against lifting from the roof but also against unwanted sliding movements relative to the roof. The measure according to the invention is very simple since only a simple rod like locking element is required which is made to cooperate with a provision which is already present in the board. It is to be noted that it is already known to lock a surf board against undesired lifting from the roof of a vehicle by means of a rod like element which extends upwardly from the supporting means in a vertical direction through the so called lee board boxn of the surf board and is provided at its end projecting upwardly beyond the board with a lock.However, the idea there is predominantly to safeguard the surf board against theft sliding movements in the driving direction are not countered by such a construction The invention is hereunder further illustrated with reference to the drawing of an embodiment given as exarqple, Figure 1 shows a perspective view of a portion of the roof of the vehicle with a supporting means for a surf board according to the invention provided thereon and Figure 2 shows a longitudinal section through the rod like locking element and the recessed bore for the mast foot corresponding therewith and provided in the surf board The supporting means as shown comprises two supporting beams 2 and 3 extending transversely front and aft on top of the vehicle roof 1, which beams are clamped at their ends through clamping brackets 4 and 5 to the roof edges la constructed as water discharge gutters.Reference number 6 indicates a surf board which is supported on the supporting beams 2 and 3 with its upper surface facing downwardly and is fixed thereto by means of lash straps 7 and 8. Reference number 9 indicates a rod shaped locking element which is secured through a connecting piece 10 to the front supporting beam 2 and extends along a certain distance in vertical direction from the supporting surface of the supporting means. The free upper extremity of the rod shaped element 9 has a shape corresponding to the mast foot end of the mast belonging to the board 6 and not further shown in the drawing. Thereby the rod shaped element 9 fits with a snap in connection or slidingly respectively in the bore 11 in the board 6 adapted for inserting the mast foot see figure 2 . When the surf board 6 is mounted on the supporting means it is therefore only necessary to take care that the rod shaped locking element 9 snaps or slides respectively with its upper end into the insert bore 11 of the board. The surf board is thereby locked against sliding movements along the supporting means. Thereafter the lash straps 7 and 8 may be connected in the usual manner. Unloading the surf board is as easy as with a supporting means not having the locking element. Different alternative solutions may be devised within the realm of the invention, particularly with respect to the manner of securing the rod like locking element 9. For longer surf boards it may be advantageous to use a supporting means consisting of three supporting beams. In that case the rod like locking element will be connected to the intermediate supporting beam. It is also possible to secure the rod like element to a connecting rod between two supporting beams. Finally the rod like locking element could also be connected directly on the vehicle roof 1 e.g through the intermediary of a connecting piece of the sucking cup type.
