# Procedure for manufacturing integrated circuit devices having sub micrometer dimension elements, and resulting structure.

## Abstract
A procedure for manufacturing a semiconductor inte grated circuit structure having device elements of sub micrometer dimension is described. A surface isolation pattern 12 in a semiconductor substrate 10 isolates regions of the semiconductor within the substrate from one another. These semiconductor regions ere designated to contain devices. At least one layer 24 is formed over the device designated regions and etched to result in a patterned layer 24 having substantially vertical sidewalls. A control led sub micrometer thickness sidewall layer 26 is formed on these vertical sidewalls. The patterned layer 24 is then removed which leaves the pattern of sub micrometer thick ness sidewall 26 , portions of which extend across certain of the device regions. A desired pattern of PN junctions is now formed in the substrate using for example diffusion or ion implantation techniques with the controlled sub micrometer thickness sidewall layer 26 used as a mask. The effect is the transfer of the submicron pattern into underlying region. This method is particularly useful in forming a sub micrometer dimension gate electrode of a field effect transistor. For improving the delineation of source, drain, and channel regions in such field effect transistors, a sidewall spacer layer 50 is formed on the sidewalls of gate electrodes 20 prior to the doping process.
