# Decarburizing a metal or metal alloy melt.

## Abstract
A process is disclosed for reducing the carbon content of a melt 8,36 of metal or metal alloy, carbon, and at least one oxide forming metallic alloying element from an initial value of about .1 wt carbon to a final value of not less than about .003 wt carbon. The process consists of contacting the melt 8,36 with a reactive oxide 18,40 of the metallic alloying element and simultaneously stirring the melt with an inert gas.
