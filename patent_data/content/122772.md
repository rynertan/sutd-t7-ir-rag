# Chemical manipulator.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a chemical manipulator adapted to automate analysis of liquids of µℓ units such as DNA sample. Within the body frame 1 are arranged a sample supply and discharging station, a mixing station, a separating station, and a drying station, each station being provided with a posi tioning device and a temperature control such as a thermosta tic tank if necessary. Reaction containers are accommodated within a bucket 7 which can accommodate a plurality of reaction containers. The bucket 7 is automatically trans ported between the stations by means of a head element 6a of a manipulator 6 which may be moved in three directions of x, y and z.
