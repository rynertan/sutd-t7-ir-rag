# Method for forming an anticorrosive coating on a metal substrate.

## Abstract
A method for forming an anticorrosive coating on the surface of a metal substrate, which comprises, in one embod iment, 1 coating the surface of the metal substrate with an anticorrosive metal capable of forming an alloy with the subs trate metal and or a hydride of the anticorrosive metal 2 heating the coated surface, and then 3 heating the coated surface in a vacuum or in an atmosphere substantially inert to the metal coating and the metal substrate by irradiating the coated surface with electron beams, laser beams or a plasma arc to sinter the coated metal and form an alloy layer in the interface between the metal substrate and the metal coating and, in another embodiment, subsequent to Step 2 and prior Step 3 above, coating the coated surface with a solution of a thermally decomposable platinum group metal compound and then heating the resulting coated surface at about 40 C to about 600 C.
