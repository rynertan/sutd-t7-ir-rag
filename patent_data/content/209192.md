## Description
The invention relates to a contact lens liquid which contains Such contact lens liquids are generally known. In the case of contact lens liquids a distinction can be made between the so called multiple solutions and the all in one solution . In the case of the multiple solution different solutions are used for introducing the contact lens into the eye and protecting the lens of the eye, while in the case of the all in one solution the same solution is used. A single solution is described in US Patent 4,126,587 in which a mixture of fatty acid amides is described. US Patent 4,048,122 also describes a cleaning liquid for soft and silicone contact lenses in which use is made of the same fatty acid as described above, together with a water soluble polyalkyleneoxy modified dimethylsilicone resin. Contact lens liquids are solutions which are intended to make a prolonged and comfortable use of lenses possible. Because the liquid may come comes into direct contact with one of the most sensitive organs of the human body the eye , they have to be sterile products. Two alternatives may be considered for guaranteeing the sterility during use. Firstly, the solutions may be supplied in so called single dose units. However, this is an expensive option. Secondly, a suitable compound with antimicrobial activity may be added to the product. The vast majority of manufacturers of contact lens liquids have chosen this solution. The manufacturer is subject to certain limitations with regard to the choice of the preservative to be used. The finished contact lens liquid must meet certain minimum requirements with regard to the antimicrobial action. The following requirements may be imposed for a so called all in one liquid, i.e. a product which is intended for disinfecting, cleaning, preserving and inserting the lenses Drawbacks were associated with preservatives used hitherto. It has now been found that a so called all in one liquid can be prepared which produces no eye irritation but is quite stable and it leads to coating of the prescription by including as preservative a quaternary phosphorus compound having the formula 1 given on the formula sheet, wherein Preferably a compound having the formula 3 is used in which R represents an alkyl radical having 5 17 carbon atoms. The compounds having the formulae 1 to 3 are already known and in particular, from the US Patent 4,209,449, in which it is reported that they have excellent foaming, viscosity enhancing, wetting, cleansing, detergent, antistatic promoting, emulsifying and bacterio static properties. These very stable compounds are tolerated well by human tissue and exhibit a low oral toxicity and low eye irritation. It is indicated that as a result they are outstandingly suitable for use for cosmetic purposes as well as for use in industry. For use in a so called all in one liquid the requirements to be imposed are, however, much higher and the requirements imposed above must be achieved. That of the large number of possible compounds it was precisely the present compound which gave much better results was not to be expected. Expediently the composition contains component a in a concentration of at most 10 by weight, preferably at most 5 by weight. A suitable component a is dipluronic poloxamer . This is preferably used in a quantity of at most 1.0 by weight of dipluronic, very particularly 0.2 0.6 by weight of dipluronic. The sodium chloride is expediently present in a concentration of at most 2 by weight. As a buffering substance, preferably at most 17 by weight of borax disodium borate together with at most 10 by weight of boric acid, is used. As EDTA. preferably disodium EDTA is used in a concentration of at most 3 by weight. A content of 0.5 by weight of disodium EDTA is preferred. The content of sodium chloride is preferably at most 0.5 by weight, while the content of boric acid is preferably 0.5 2.5 by weight. The content of sodium borate is preferably 0.05 5 by weight, in particular 0.01 0.8 by weight. Particularly good results are obtained if at least 0.0001 by weight and at most 0.06 by weight of thiomersal sodium ethylmercurithiosalicylate is also present.
