## Description
This invention relates to a method for preparing a synthetic fuel and or synthetic components for fuels, and the product obtained by said method.Various methods are known in the art for preparing synthetic fuels, in particular starting from coal by hydroliquefaction or pyrolysis, or starting from synthesis gases.However, all the known methods suffer from the drawback of involving high plant andfor operating costs.Numerous methods exist for oxidising coal with oxygen, oxygencontaining gases or oxidising substances in an aqueous alkaline medium.A large percentage of the product of this oxidation consists of polycarboxylic acid mixtures.Examples of methods for producing carboxylic acids by oxidising coal include those described in French patent 1,347,213 and in German patents 841,140, 864,992 and 879,103.The polycarboxylic acids obtained by known methods cannot be used as fuels because of their acidic nature, so that their use is practically limited to the chemical field.It has been surprisingly found that polycarboxylic acid mixtures can be converted into fuels andlor components for fuels by transforming them into oleophilic compounds in a simple and economical manner. Bcsides polycarboxylic acid mixtures obtained by oxidising coal, polycarboxylic aid mixtures of any origin can obviously be used for transformation into oleophilic compounds provided that their elementary compositions, molecular weight and acidity lie within the limits indicated hereinafter.A first subject matter of the present invention is a method for transforming polycarboxylic acid mixtures into oleophilic compounds which can be used as synthetic fuel and or synthetic components for fuels.The method for preparing a synthetic fuel andlor synthetic components for fuels according to the present invention starts with a polycarboxylic acid mixture obtained in any manner, and is characterised by the polycarboxylic acids having the following elementary composition carbon from 42X to 70Z by weight hydrogen from l.SZ to 6X by weight oxygen from 14.02 to 52.7X by weight, a mean molecular weight of between 120 and 800, and an acidity of between 5 and 18 meq g, and preferably between 8 and 14 meqlg, the mixture of polycarboxylic acids or their salts being subjected to decarboxylation which in the case of acids is carried out by heat treatment over catalysts constituted by transition metal oxides, and in the case of salts by simple heat treatment, the decarboxylated product being finally subjected to esterification with one or more alcohols or one or more olefins.The decarboxylation can be effected by heating, in aqueous solution, for a time of between 10 and 30 minutes, preferably 20 minutes to a temperature of between 3000 and 350 C, preferably 315it, in the presence of one or more alkaline and or alkaline earth carbonates.Alternatively, the decarboxylation can be effected in the absence of water at a temperature of between 35Q and 5500C, preferably 500 C, for a time of between 10 and 30 minutes, preferably 20 minutes. The esterification is preferably effected with alcohols comprising 1 to 10 carbon atoms, the alcohols being in H2S04 solution at a concentration of between 5X and 20 by weight, or with olefins comprising between 2 and 10 carbon atoms. A second subject matter of the present invention is the synthetic fuel and or the synthetic components for fuels, when obtained by the aforesaid method.A third subject matter of the present invention is the fuel obtained by mixing the synthetic fuel and or synthetic components according to the invention with products chose from a medium petroleum distillate, a medium distillate from coal hydroliquefaction, the product of coal pyrolysis and particularly the mixture of benzene, toluene and xylenes,a fuel oil of petroleum origin, a mixture of aromatic hydrocarbons or a mixture of C1 C10 aliphatic alcohols.
