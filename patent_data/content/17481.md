# Self sealing valve assembly to facilitate unplugging of a centrifugal cleaner.

## Abstract
A self sealing element 56 is provided in the outer wall 38,52 of the discharge chamber of a centrifugal cleaning apparatus 10 opposite the rejects discharge outlet 17 . When a blockage occurs at the discharge outlet, a long needle like nozzle is inserted through the sealing element 56 to the blockage. Water or air under pressure is expelled from orifices in the nozzle and breaks up the blockage. After the nozzle is withdrawn, the sealing element 56 , which may be formed of a silicone rubber, reseals itself.
