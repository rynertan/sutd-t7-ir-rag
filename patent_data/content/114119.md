# A METHOD OF AND APPARATUS FOR MANUFACTURING BINDERS

## Abstract
The invention is concerned with a method of and appara tus for manufacturing a binder defined by a pair of elongate supports for clamping together a plurality of sheets of paper. The supports are manufactured from an extruded strip. The ap paratus advances the extruded strip on a rail to a cutting station which cuts the strip into unit strips. A binder cover sheet is in troduced into a unit strip and the strip is pressed to secure the cover sheet in position. The unit strip and cover sheet are ad vanced to a punching station and dimpling station for the punching of apertures in the channel and the formation of dimples. The unit strip is then transferred to an index station where the binder components are loaded onto the unit strip. Two unit strips and binder covers are then shrink wrapped together in polyethylene film.
