These copolymers are readily compatible with styrene polymers andlor copolymers and give tongh blends. Polyarylates are polyesters derive from one or more dihydric phenols. particularly 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane, also identified as B isphenol A. and one or more aromatic dicarboxylic acids. particularly mixtures of terephthalic and isophthalic acids. These polyarylates are high temperature. high performance thermoplastic polymers with a good combination of thermal and mechanical properties. They also have good processability which allows them to be molded into a variety of articles. Polyarylate polymers are compatible with a vide variety of other polymeric systems.

It has now been found that by first forming a copolymer of a polyphenylene oxide and a polyarylate, the resulting copolymers are compatible with styrene polymers and or copolymers.

The dihydric phenol diester is prepared by reacting a dihydric phenol with an acid anhydride at a temperature of from about 130 to about 1600C for a period of from about 0.5 to about 4 hours and at a pressure of from about 1 to about 3 atmospheres.Generally, the reaction is carried out using an excess of acid anhydride. The acid anhydride is used at about 25 percent excess. The process is preferably carried out at a pressure sufficient to have the solvent ref fluxing at the reaction temperature. Under these conditions conversion to the dihydric phenol diester is at least 99.9 percent. The polyarylate polymerization process is carried out at a temperature of from about 260 to about 350 C and preferably, from about 260 to about 295C.

Two procedures can be used for the preparation of the polyarylates via the acid chloride route. One is carried out at low temperature and the other at high temperature. In the low temperature technique polycondensation of the acid chlorides derived from terephthalic and isophthalic acids with the dihydric phenols is effected at ambient temperatures in an inert solvent, such as methylene chloride. in the presence of a basic catalyst and an acid acceptor. A second immiscible solvent. e.g., water, may be present. In the high temperature technique, polycondensation of acid chlorides with the dihydric phenols, is effected in a high boiling solvent, such as 1,Z,4 trichlorobenzene, at temperatures above about 150 C, and preferably, at about 200 to about 220 C. Other suitable inert organic solvents useful for low temperature polycondensation include halogenated aliphatic compounds. such as, chloroform, methylene bromide, 1,1,2 trichloroethane as well as methylene chloride mentioned above and the like and cyclic ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, and the like.

Typical catalyst include tin cowpounds and generally those mentioned above for the diacetate process.Particularly preferred catalysts are Ti and tin salts, Mg acetate, and alkali metal salts, alkoxides and phenoxides.

After formation of the backbone, at least one grafting monomer, and preferably two. are polymerized in the presence of the prepolymerized backbone to obtain the graft polymer. These resins are prepared by methods well known in the art. The backbone polymer. as mentioned. is preferably a conjugated diene polymer such as polybutadiene, polyisoprene. or a copolymer. such as butadiene styrene, butadiene acrylonitrile. or the like. The specific conjugated diene monomers normally utilized in preparing the backbone of the graft polymer are generically described by the following formula EMI17.1 wherein X may be hydrogen. alkyl groups containing from one to five carbon atoms chlorine or bromine. Examples of dienes that may be used are butadiene. isoprene. 1.3 heptadiene. methyl 1.3 pentadiene. 2,3 dimethyl 1,3, butadiene, 2 ethyl1,3 pentadiene 1.3 and 2.4 hexadienes. chloro and bromo substituted butadienes such as dichlorobutadiene, bromobutadiene, dibromobutadiene.mixtures thereof. and the likev A preferred conjugated diene is butadiene.

In this case, the styrenes may comprise from about 30 to about 80 by weight of the total graft polymer composition. In preparing the polymer, it is normal to have a certain percentage of the polymerizing monomers that are grafted on the backbone combine with each other and occur as free copolymer. If styrene is utilized as one of the grafting monomers and acrylonitrile as the second grafting monomer. a certain portion of the composition will copolymerize as free styrene acrylonitrile copolymer. In the case where a methylstyrene or other monomer is substituted for the styrene in the composition used in preparing the graft polymer, a certain percentage of the composition may be an a methylstyrene acrylonitrile copolymer.
