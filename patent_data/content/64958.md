# IMPROVEMENTS IN MOTOR VEHICLE PLATFORM LIFTS

## Abstract
A motor vehicle platform lift is provided of the four column type. The lift comprises four hydraulic lifting cylin ders 2 each arranged in correspondence with a respective column of the lift, and four hydraulic pumps 6 , each connected to a respective one of the cylinders 2 via a respective pipeline 10 . Each of the pipelines 10 includes a respective non return valve 14 operative to permit the passage of fluid from the corresponding pump 6 to its associated cylinder 2 whereby to provide for elevation of the platform lift and its maintenance at a desired height. The lift also includes control means 19 for neutralising the operation of the non return valves 14 so as to permit lowering of the lift by allowing the return flow of fluid from the cylinders 2 . In order to ensure that all four cylinders 2 operate in synchronism both during elevation and lowering of the platform lift, the drive shaft 6a of the pumps 6 are made fast for rotation with each other.
