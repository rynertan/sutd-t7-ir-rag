## Description
PROCESS FOR ThE PREPARATION OF IMPACT RESISTANT THERMJOPLASTIC POLYMER MIXTURES AND IMPACT RESISTANT POLYMER COMPOSITIONS Baclcgromd of the Invention The invention relates to a process for the preparation of impact resistant thermoplastic polymer mixtures on the basis of a therr loplastic polymer and a rubber. The invention also relates to a process for the preparation of impact resistant polymer compositions starting from such impact resistant thermoplastic polymer mixtures. It is known to prepare impact resistant thermoplastic polymer mixtures by preparing a matrix of a thermoplastic polymer, such as polystyrene, with rubber particles, for instance a copolymer of styrene butadiene, dispersed in it see, for instance, Rubber Chem.Technology 43 1970 , page 1129 ff. . The mixture thus obtained is usually converted into granules, in particular granulate, using known methods such as batch kneading and or extrusion, and is sold to the process industry in that form. It has been found that further processing of such a granulate, for instance by injection moulding or sheet extrusion, is attended by some undesirable phenomena, such as changes in shape and size of the dispersed particles and delamination of the object obtained from such a granulate. It has already been proposed to reduce these detrimental phenomena in the processing of such polymer mixture granules, so as to impart greater stability to the product, by adding an agent promoting adhesion of the rubber in the thermoplastic matrix during preparation of the mixture see, for instance, Journal Macromol, Science Physics Ed, volume B 17 2 , 1980, pages 355 374 .The addition of an agent promoting the adhesion between a vinyl aromatic polymer and a diene rubber with a view to obtaining a composition having good impact resistance is already described in French patent application 2329705. Although a mixture obtained by such a process is more stable in processing, it has been found that delamination may still occur to a rather substantial degree when such a mixture is processed. The present invention provides a process which permits the preparation of impact resistant thermoplastic polymer mixtures based upon a thermoplastic polymer and a rubber, which mixtures exhibit very little or no delamination in the end product upon further processing. European patent specification 44234 describes a process for the preparation of a graft copolymer of styrene and an ethylenepropylene terpolymer, which graft copolymer is subjected to irradiation after being prepared. In this process styrene and rubber are dissolved in ethyl benzene, after which bulk polymerization takes place. The disadvantage of this method is that it is laborious and economically less attractive. Summary of the Invention The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of impact resistant thermoplastic polymer mixtures having improved properties after processing, comprising the steps of a preparing, in a mixing zone, a mixture having a matrix phase of athermoplastic polymer that is resistant to irradiation and a phase of rubber particles dispersed therein, in the presence of a compound which promotes adhesion of the particles in the matrix, b solidifying the mixture from the mixing zone, and c subjecting the mixture from the mixing zone to irradiation, either before or after solidification. A thermoplastic polymer that is resistant to irradiation is here understood to mean a thermoplastic polymer the good properties of which are retained to a sufficient degree upon the irradiation necessary for cross linking of the rubber particles. This process has been found to yield a mixture in which the optimum size and shape of the particles, as present in het matrix, are essentially fixed, and thus are retained throughout further processing.The explanation of this phenomenon is that the dispersed rubber phase becomes wholly or partly cross linked as a result of the irradiation and remains anchored in the matrix, while the matrix itself is hardly cross linked at all under the influence of the irradiation, and, therefore, remains thermoplastic. Detailed Description of the Invention The mixtures of a thermoplastic polymer and a rubber to be applied in this process can be obtained in ways known per se and in mixing zones known per se, for instance using continuous methods such as single or double screw extrusion, or using dscontinuous methods such as batch kneading or rolling. The ratio of the components in the mixture may vary widely.In general, a mixture is used that contains about 50 to 95 parts by weight, preferably about 75 to 90 parts by weight thermoplastic polymer, and about 50 to 5 parts by weight, preferably 25 to 10 parts by weight rubber particles. As thermoplastic component in this embodiment, in principle use can be made of every thermoplastic polymer that is resistant to irradiation. The thermoplastic polymers that can be applied include polystyrene, copolymer of styrene with, for instance, acrylonitrile or with maleic anhydride, polyamides such as nylon 6, nylon 6.6, nylon 4.6, nylon 12 and copolymers thereof, polyesters such as polyethylene terephthalate or polybutylene terephthalate, polypropylene or polycarbonates. Co polymers of styrene are preferred. The rubbers that can be applied include polybutadiene, a butadiene acrylonitrile or butadiene styrene copolymer, an acrylate or butyl rubber, an ethylene propylene or ethylene vinylacetate copolymer, a chlorinated polyethylene, an ethylene propylene copolymer in which other polyunsaturated monomers such as dicyclopentadiene or ethylidene norbornene are copolymerized, or mixtures of two or more of these rubbers. It is also possible to apply a mixture of such a rubber with other rubbery polymers, such as polyisobutene. It has been found that the impact resistance of the mixture increases if the particle size of the rubber particles dispersed in the thermoplastic matrix decreases.It has further been found that a mixture with optimum impact resistance is obtained if the number average particle size determined by scanning electron microscopy of the rubber particles dispersed in the matrix is at most 1.0 L, preferably in the range of between about 0.1 and 1.0 , and most preferably between about 0.2 0.5 Such a mixture can be obtained if, during the preparation a compound is added that reduces the rubber particle size and, at the same time, promotes the adhesion of the particles in the matrix. It has been found that, to serve this purpose, the compound should con sist of polymer units of which at least a portion is soluble in the matrix phase and another portion is soluble in the rubber phase. Examples of such compounds are di and tri blocks, such as ethylene styrene or isobutene sty rene copolymers, graft polymers of styrene and an ethylene propylene polyunsaturated monomer, or hydrogenated butadiene styrene or styrene butadiene styrene block copolymers. If polystyrene or a copolymer of styrene is applied as thermoplastic component, a very suitable agent is a product marketed under the name of Kraton G 1652 RTM by Shell, which is prepared by anionic block polymerization of styrene and butadiene to an unsaturated styrene butadiene styrene block copolymer, which is subsequently hydrogenated, yielding a styrene ethylene butene styrene block copolymer with less than 1 wt. unsaturation see Polymer Eng. and Science, 23 June 1983 No. 9, pages 510 514 . If a polywiide is applied as theritxlastic, the suitable agents including block cgpolFers of isobutene and one or mze lactams, and graft copolyiners on the basis of carboxylated EPDM with a nylon, while a block copolymer of propylene and ethylene is suitable for thermoplastics containing polypropylene. The amount of such an adhesion promoting agent in the mix ture may vary, for instance from between about 0.1 to 10 wot. , calcu lated relative to the polymer mixture. If an agent is utilized that can be mixed with the rubber, and that itself is at least partially crosslinkable under the influence of irradiation, a larger amount of the agent can, in principle, be used, and be amount of rubber can be reduced proportionally. If a suitable agent is chosen, it even is possible to use such agent to replace the total amount of rubber. The polymer mixture thus obtained is either processed as such into polymer products or first solidified in manners known per se, for instance by converting into a granulate,ribbon, strand, or strip suitable for transport, storage, and further processing. By preference, the mixture is converted into a granulate. According to the invention, the mixture obtained from the mixing zone, or the granulate, ribbon, strand, or strip prepared from it, is irradiated. This can be effected by passing the product below an irradiation source or passing the mixture or product between the irradiation sources. As irradiation source, preferably an electron beam donor can be applied, but in principle a gamma radiation source, such as Cobalt 60, also can be applied. A list of customary irradiation sources and methods is presented in Rubber Chemistry and Technology 55 1982 , pages 575 668. The irradiation intensity applied to this process may vary, depending on the diameter or thickness of the diameter or thickness of the product to be irradiated, the intensity generally being increased for products having a larger diameter or thickness. The irradiation dose level is preferably chosen to be in the range of between about 0.1 and 20 Mrad, and most preferably between about 0.5 and 5 Mrad. The irradiation may be carried out at reduced, elevated, or atmospheric pressure, optionally in an inert atmosphere which is practically free of oxygen, and the product or mixture may be at room temperature, or at a reduced or elevated temperature. When an elevated temperature for instance 500 C is used, a lower irradiation dose suffices, and for this reason this embodiment is to be preferred. There also may be some advantage in incorporating an agent which promotes the irradiation effectiveness in the mixture. Suitable agents are polyfunctional unsaturated compounds which dissolve at least in part in the rubber, such as triallyl cyanurate and isocyanurate, trimethylolpropanetrimethacrylate, ethylene glycoldim ethacrylate, triallyphosphite, or a low molecular 1,2 polybutadiene. A list of suitable agents promoting the irradiation effectivity is presented inPlastics Technology, 10, 1964 , page 28. The amount applied of such agents may vary, for instance between about 0.1 and 10 wt. , calculated relative to the rubber component. The polymer mixtures thus obtained can be processed as such into polymer products, for instance through injection moulding, sheet extrusion, and the like. The products obtained are highly suitable for articles that must have, on the one hand, reasonable rigidity, and on the other hand, high light or weather resistance, such as parts of TV sets or office machines, garden furniture, or sports articles. The polymer mixtures obtained can also be mixed with compatible polymers and subsequently be processed into polymer products. The polymer mixtures are eminently suitable for the preparation of thermoplastic polymer compositions having a high impact resistance by mixing these products with thermoplastic copolymers that are miscible with them. They are particularly suitable for admixing in engineering plastics such as polyphenylene oxides, for instance in an amount. of about 10 to 90 parts by weight of polymer mixture with about 90 to 10 parts by weight of polyphenylene oxides.

Figures 3 and 4 are microscopic pictures of irradiated product in accordance with the invention from Test No. 2 of Example I below. Description of Preferred Embodiments of the Invention Preferred embodiments of the invention will be described in greater detail in the following examples, without being restricted thereto. Example I To a batch kneader of the David Bridge type, polystyrene, rubber, and a compatibilizer were supplied in a weight ratio of 75 20 5. As the polystyrene, a granular product marketed by Dow under the name of Styron 686 E RTM was applied. The rubber was an EPDM rubber marketed by DSM under the name of Keltan 378 RTM , and the compatibilizer was a product marketed by Shell under the name ofKraton G1652 RTM . The starting temperature in the kneader was approximately 110 120 C, which increased to approximately 2000 C during kneading speed 160 rpm . The mixture leaving the kneader was granulated in an extruder Schwabentahn type . A portion of the granulate thus formed was irradiated in two steps with the aid of 3 MeV electron gun, at a temperature of approximately 500 C and a total irradiation dose of 4 Mrad. The remaining portion of the granulate was not irradiated. Both the irradiated and the non irradiated granulate were further processed into bars suitable for an Izod determination in accordance with ASTM standard 256 56 in an injection moulding apparatus of the Teknika type of approximately 2400 C.Test No. 1 Comparative Test The Izod value of the non irradiated product was 7.8 0.2 kJ m2. After injection moulding the structure of the product clearly was inhomogeneous, which is illustrated by microscopic pictures ofFigures 1 and 2. Especially at the edge, a laminar structure buildup was discernible photograph of Figure 2 . The product clearly showed delamination. On deflection, for instance, objectionable flaking occurred. Test NQ 2 According to the Invention The Izod value of the irradiated product was somewhat higher than that of the non irradiated product, i.e., 8.3 0.3 kJ m2.After injection moulding the product had a very homogeneous structure photographs of Figures 3 and 4 and exhibited hardly any laminar structure at the edge photograph of Figure 4 . On deflection, for instance, no flaking or any other del am nation phenomena whatsoever occurred.Comparative Example A Tests Nas 3 and 4 In the way described in Example I, polystyrene of the typeStyron 686 E RTM was granulated, a portion of the granulated was irradiated and both the irradiation and the non irradiated granulate were injection moulded. Neither the irradiated nor the non irradiated product were found to be impact resistant the Izod values were practically identical, i.e., 1.5 0.1 kJ m2 and 1.3 0.1 kJ m2, respectively.Comparative Example B In the same way as in Example I, polystyrene of the typeStyron 686 M RTM was mixed with varius Keltan rubber types and compatibilizers, and thereafter granulated and injection moulded at 2000 C. Of the products obtained, the Izod value and the rubber particle size were determined. The results are presented in Table I.

The Izod value of the products obtained was found to be slightly higher than that ofComparative Example B, while no delamination phenomena whatsoever occurred.Example m In the same way as in Example I, mixtures were prepared of 75 wt polystyrene Styron 686 E RTM , 20 wt. rubber Keltan 378 RTM , and 5 wt. compatibilizer Kraton G 1652 RTM , following which the mixture was granulated, irradiated, and injection moulded.The results are summarized in Table II.

The products obtained did not exhibit any delamination. The results are summarized in Table m. Table 111 Test Polystyrene Rubber Compati Injection Irrad.
