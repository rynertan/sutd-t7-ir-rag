# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR COUNTING BACTERIA IN A BACTERIA CONTAINING SUSPENSION, METHOD FOR FLUORESCENCE STAINING OF BACTERIA, AND METHOD FOR SEPARATING BACTERIA FROM A SAMPLE

## Abstract
A suspension of fiuorescence stained bacteria is applied as a film, preferably of a thickness of 2 7 µm, on the edge of a rotating disc, and the film is illuminated with U.V. light. Through a microscope, light impulses from bacteria in the film passing a zone of preferably 2 4 µm transverse to direction of movement of the disc edge are transferred to a transducer, and the electrical signals from the transducer are discriminated according to size and signals exceeding a pre determined size are counted. Disc preferably has a diameter of 8 12 cm and rotates at 10 40 rpm. Fluorochrome dye is preferably acridine orange or ethidium bromide. Method for staining comprises increasing contrast between bacteria and background by incubating with a proteolytic enzyme, or incu bating in a nutrient medium containing an antibiotic preven ting division of bacteria, or adding formaldehyde when stai ning with acridine orange. Separation of bacteria from a sam ple comprises centrifugation with a higher density liquid sys tem comprising continuous or discontinuos density gradient, especially in a dish like centrifuge in which sample passes over two component liquid system to move bacteria to inter face between components.
