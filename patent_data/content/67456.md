# Method of rolling plastically deformable material.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to shaped articles pre pared from a plastically deformable composite material, the shaped articles comprising a matrix, the matrix comprising A a coherent structure comprising substantially den sely packed inorganic solid particles of a size of 0.5 100 µm B substantially densely packed inorganic solid parti cles having a size of from about 50 Å to about 0.5 µm and being at least one order of magnitude smaller than the particles A, or a coherent structure formed from such homogeneously arranged particles, The particles B being homogeneously arranged in the voids between the particles A, the dense packing being substantially a packing corres ponding to the one obtainable by gentle mechanical influ ence on a system of geometrically equally shaped large particles in which locking surface forces do not have any significant effect, D additional bodies having an aspect ratio of about 3 1 100 1 and a diameter of the order of 0.5 10 µm, and optionally C particles of a solid plasticizing agent, and or E reinforcing fibres having an aspect ratio of at least 100 1. Furthermore, the invention relates to a composite mate rial per se, to a method for rolling a plastically deformable material, and to an apparatus for rolling a plastically deformable material,
