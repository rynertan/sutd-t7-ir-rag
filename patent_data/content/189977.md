## Description
This invention relates to sulphonanilides and to their use in agriculture. According to the invention there are provided compounds of formula IEMI1.1 in which Q is Sn or Si R is alkyl R1 is alkyl or halogen R2 is hydrogen or alkyl R3, R4 and R , which are the same or different, are optionally substituted alkyl alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl or aryl, and n is 0 to 4. Compounds analogous to those of formula I, in which the substituted Q group is replaced by, for example hydrogen or alkyl. are known from G.B. Patent No 2012170. Q is preferably Sn. R, R1, R2 are preferably methyl. Alkyl groups are preferably of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, especially methyl. Substituents, when present include halogen alkoxy e.g. of 1 to 4 carbon atoms and aryl.Aryl groups are usually phenyl, optionally substituted a eg. by halogen, haloalkyl, alkoxy or nitro. The term aryl may include heteroaryl groups such as thienyl, furyl or pyridyl. Cycloalkyl groups are usually of 3 to 8 carbon atoms especially cyclopentyl or cyclohexyl. The compounds of the invention have activity as fungicides, especially against fungal diseases of plants.e.g. mildews, especially vine downy mildew Plasmopara viticola . They are also active against powdery mildews such as barley powdery mildew Erysiphe praminis as well as being active against diseases such as rice blast Pyricularia oryzae , wheat brown rust Puccinia recondita and potato blight Phytophthora infestans . The invention thus also provides a method of combating fungi at a locus infested or liable to be infested therewith, which comprises applying to the locus a compound of formula I. The invention also provides an agricultural composition comprising a compound of formula I in admixture with an agronomically acceptable diluent or carrier. The composition of the invention may of course include more than one compound of the invention. In addition the composition can comprise one or more additional active ingredient8, for example compounds known to possess plant growth regulant. herbicidal, fungicidal, insecticidal or acaricidal properties. Alternatively the compounds of the invention can be used in sequence with the other active ingredient.Fungicides which can be used in conjunction with the compounds of the present invention include maneb. mancozeb, zineba thiram, propineb, benomyl, carbendazim, iprodione. vinclozolin, fosetyl aluminium, sulphur, triadimefon, dichlofluanid, metalaxyl. furalaxyl, ofurace, benalaxyl, oxadixyl, cyprofuram, prochloraz and metal complexes of this, e.g. the manganese chloride complex , guazatine. captain, captafol, folpet and various copper salts. The diluent or carrier in the composition of the invention can be a solid or a liquid optionally in association with a surface active agent a for example a dispersing agent, emulsifying agent or wetting agent.Suitable surface active agents include anionic compounds such as a carboxylate. for example a metal carboxylate of a long chain fatty acid an N acylsarcosinate mono or di esters of phosphoric acid with fatty alcohol ethoxylates or salts of such esters fatty alcohol sulphates such as sodium dodecyl sulphate, sodium octadecyl sulphate or sodium cetyl sulphate ethoxylated fatty alcohol sulphates ethoxylated alkylphenol sulphates lignin sulphonates petroleum sulphonates alkyl aryl sulphonates such as alkyl benzene sulphonates or lower alkylnaphthalene sulphonates, e.g.butyl naphthalene sulphonate salts of sulphonated naphthalene formaldehyde condensates salts of sulphonated phenol formaldehyde condensates or more complex sulphonates such as the amide sulphonates, e.g. the sulphonated condensation product of oleic acid andN methyl taurine or the dialkyl sulphosuccinates. e.g. the sodium sulphonate of dioctyl succinate.Nonionic agents include condensation products of fatty acid esters a fatty alcohols, fatty acid amides or fatty alkyl or alkenyl substituted phenols with ethylene oxide, fatty esters of polyhydric alcohol ethers, e.g. sorbitan fatty acid esters, condensation products of such esters with ethylene oxide, e.g. polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters, block copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide acetylenic glycols such as 2,4,7.9 tetramethyl 5 decyn 4.7 diol, or ethoxylated acetylenic glycols. Examples of a cationic surface active agent include, for instance, an aliphatic mono , di , or polyamine as an acetate, naphthenate or oleate an oxygen containing amine such as an amine oxide or polyoxyethylene alkylamine an amide linked amine prepared by the condensation of a carboxylic acid with a di or polyamine or a quaternary ammonium salt. The compositions of the invention can take any form known in the art for the formulation of agrochemicals, for example a a solution a dispersion, an aqueous emulsion, a dusting powder, a seed dressing, a fumigant, a smoke, a dispersible powder, an emulsifiable concentrate or granules. Moreover it can be in a suitable form for direct application or as a concentrate or primary composition which requires dilution with a suitable quantity of water or other diluent before application. An emulsifiable concentrate comprises a compound of the invention dissolved in a water immiscible solvent which is formed into an emulsion with water in the presence of an emulsifying agent. A dusting powder comprises a compound of the invention intimately mixed and ground with a solid pulverulent diluent for example, kaolin. A granular solid comprises a compound of the invention associated with similar diluents to those which may be employed in dusting powders, but the mixture is granulated by known methods. Alternatively it comprises the active ingredient absorbed or adsorbed on a pre granular diluent, for example, Fuller s earth, attapulgite or limestone grit. Wettable powders. granules or grains usually comprise the active ingredient in admixture with a suitable surfactant and an inert powder diluent such as china clay. Another suitable concentrate is a flowable suspension concentrate which is formed by grinding the compound with water or other liquid, a wetting agent and a suspending agent. The concentration of the active ingredient in the composition of the present invention, as applied to plants is preferably within the range of 0.01 to 3.0 per cent by weight, especially 0.01 to 1.0 per cent by weight. In a primary composition the amount of active ingredient can vary widely and can be, for example, from 5 to 95 per cent by weight of the composition. In the method of the invention the compound is generally applied to seeds, plants or their habitat.Thus, the compound can be applied directly to the soil before, at or after drilling so that the presence of active compound in the soil can control the growth of fungi which may attack seeds. When the soil is treated directly the active compound can be applied in any manner which allows it to be intimately mixed with the soil such as by spraying, by broadcasting a solid form of granules, or by applying the active ingredient at the same time as drilling by inserting it in the same drill as the seeds.A suitable applications rate is within the range of from 0.05 to 20 kg per hectare, more preferably from 0.1 to 1 kg per hectare. Alternatively the active compound can be applied directly to the plant by, for example, spraying or dusting either at the time when the fungus has begun to appear on the plant or before the appearance of fungus as protective measure. In both such cases the preferred mode of application is by foliar spraying. It is generally important to obtain good control of fungi in the early stages of plant growth as this is the time when the plant can be most severely damaged. The spray or dust can conveniently contain a pre or post emergence herbicide if this is thought necessary. Sometimes, it is practicable to treat the roots of a plant before or during planting, for example. by dipping the roots in a suitable liquid or solid composition.When the active compound is applied directly to the plant a suitable rate of application is from 0.01 to 10 kg. per hectare preferably from 0.05 to 5 kg per hectare. The compounds of the invention may be obtained by reacting a compound of formula IIEMI7.1 where Z is hydrogen or one equivalent of a metal e.g.sodium. with a compound of formula III EMI8.1 where Y is a leaving group, such as halogen e.g. chlorine. When Q is Sn, Z is preferably a metal and the compound of formula II is generally obtained in situ from the free acid and a base such as an alkali metal hydroxide or hydride. When Q is Si, Z is preferably hydrogen and the reaction is generally carrried out in the presence of an organic base, e.g. an amine, such as imidazole. Compounds of formula II are described in GB Pat. No.2012170. When R2 is alkyl the products can be obtained in resolved form either by resolving the compound of formulaI or by using a stereoisomer of formula II. The formulaII stereoisomer can be obtained by conventional resolution methods or by reacting a compound of formula IVEMI8.2 with the appropriate stereoisomer of a compound of formula V EMI9.1 where X is a leaving group, such as halogen or tosyloxy. The invention thus also includes optical isomers of the compounds of formula I. The invention is illustrated in the followingExamples.
