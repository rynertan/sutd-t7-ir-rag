## Description
Composition and Method for Enhancing the ImpactResistance of Chlorinated Poly Vinyl Chloride and Impact Modified Chlorinated Poly Vinyl Chloride This invention relates to the impact modification of thermoplastic polymers. The invention is concerned with compositions and methods for enhancing the impact resistance properties of chlorinated poly vinyl chloride CPVC and with impact modified CPVC. Chlorinated poly vinyl chloride without impact modification is too brittle for many uses. A number of materials have been used to modify the impact resistance of CPVC such as chlorinated polyethylene and acrylic modifiers, i.e. rubbery acrylate elastomers. Acrylic modifiers can provide better impact resistance than chlorinated polyethylene but they perform poorly in chemical resistance tests. Diene based modifiers have been thought to be unsuitable for CPVC because a major use of CPVC is in the manufacture of piping and CPVC containing such modifiers loses its impact strength on long term exposure to hot water, such as in hot water pipes. We have now found how to confer upon CPVC compositions improved impact strength which will not substantially degrade on long term hot water exposure or contact with chemicals. ccordin to the invention there is provided a composition for enhancing the impact resistance properties of chlorillated polyvinyl chloride characterized in that the composition comprises an impact modifying polymer containing units of at least one diene and firm 0.5 to 20 by weight of the impactemodifying polymer of at least one antioxidant. Diene based impact modifiers are well known, any of them can be used in this invention. Although such modifiers are often prepared by processes using antioxidants to stabilize the polymer during isolation, insufficient antioxidant remains after polymerization and isolation to achieve the objectives of this invention. Preferably the diene based modifier contains units of 1,3 butadiene, isoprene or chloroprene. The modifier may be a simple copolymer or, more preferably, a multistage heteropolymer. In such multistage polymers the first stage preferably comprises from 60 to 100S by weight of dieneunits, preferably butadiene units. Other types of modifiers which are suitable include those formed from acrylonitrile, butadiene, styrene and optionally methyl methacrylate. Preferably the impact modifying polymer is a multistage heteropolymer having a first elastomeric stage containing units of butadiene and styrene, one or more optional intermediate stages and a final stage containing units of methyl methacrylate. The diene based modifier may contain from 20 to 99 by weight of diene units. The higher the level of diene, the more effective is the impact modifier, but there are upper limits to the amount of diene which can in practice be incorporated into a given polymer. The amount of diene based impact modifier typically used in this invention is from 1 to 20 percent by weight of the chlorinated poly vinyl chloride . Amounts below about 1 percent do not give sufficient impact improvement to made the addition worthwhile, and amounts above about 20 percent do not incrementally improve the impact strength enough to compensate for reduction in heat deformation resistance. Preferably amounts between about 5 and 15 percent are used and result in very significant, costeffective improvements in the impact strength of CPVC. The antioxidant preferably comprises from 0.5 to 5 by weight o she impact modifying polymer. Preferably the antioxidant comprises at least one hindered phenol, substituted amine or hydrocarbyl phosphite. Examples of suitable antioxidants are listed in Table B herein. Hindered phenols are the most preferred group of antioxidants, in particular, 1,3,5 trimethyl 2,4,6 tris 3,5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxyphenyl benzene, bisphenol A, t3 4 hydroxyphenylpropionafe and 2,6 di tert. butyl p cresol. The antioxidant is usually added after polymerization and isolation of the impact modifier polymer. The diene based impact modifier antioxidant compo sitlon of this invention is effective in preparing high impact strength, thermally and chemically stable CPVC compositions. Thus the invention also provides a method of enhancing the impact resistance properties of chlorfnated poly vinyl chloride which comprises blending from 5 to 25 parts by weight of the diene based modifier antioxidant composition described herein with 100 parts by weight of chlorinated poly vinyl chloride . The impact modified CPVC is also an aspect of this invention. Such compositions preferably comprise from 5 to 25 parts by weight of the diene based modifier antioxidant compositions described herein per 100 parts by weight of CPVC. The compositions of the invention may contain other additives which are conventionally added to CPVC formulations, such as stabilizers, lubricants, opacifying agents, processing aids, colorants, pigments and dyes. Some preferred embodiments of the invention will now be more particularly described in and by the followingExamples, in which all parts and percentages are by weight. EXAMPLE 1EMI4.1 each of the diene based impact modifiers listed in Table A is added 1 percent based on weight of modifier of. one of the antioxidants listed in Table B. The antioxidants are blended with the previously prepared and isolated modifier polymers, and the blends are all found useful for modifying CPVC.
