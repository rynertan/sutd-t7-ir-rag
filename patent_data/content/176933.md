# Bar code reading apparatus.

## Abstract
A bar code reading apparatus comprises a reading unit 11 for optically reading a bar code and generating an output data corresponding to this bar code, a memory 22 , and a data processing unit 20, 21, 23, 24 for storing the output data from the reading unit 11 into the memory 22 and making a bar code data in accordance with the content of the memory 22 . This reading apparatus further has a mode selection flag PSF for selectively instructing either one of the first and second modes, and the data processing unit 20, 21, 23, 24 stores the output data from the reading unit 11 as it is into the memory 22 when the first mode is designated by the mode selection flag PSF , while the data processing unit stores the inverted data of the output data from the reading unit 11 into the memory 22 when the second mode is set by the mode selection flag PSF .
