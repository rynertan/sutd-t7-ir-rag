# DEVICE FOR DETECTING A FAULTY CONDITION IN SURFACES LUBRICATED BY A LUBRICANT AND ROLLING OR SLIDING RELATIVELY TO ONE ANOTHER

## Abstract
The claimed detection system is particularly suitable for controlling the working conditions between rolling elements e.g. in a bearing or such arrangement for which a premature ly information concerning defects or defaults which are developing is of importance i.e. information sufficiently in time before failures become unacceptable. The system comprises a unit 1 which in and output are connected to the inner and outer bearing race rings resp. The unit 1 produces the signal V
