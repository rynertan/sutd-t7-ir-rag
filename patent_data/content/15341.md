## Description
The present invention relates to the production of basic magnesium sulphonates which are particularly useful as additives for lubricating oils and the present invention also provides lubricating oils containing these basic magnesium sulphonates. The term basic magnesium sulphonate is used to describe materials containing a stoichiometric excess of magnesium compared to that required to neutralize the sulphonic acid. Basic magnesium sulphonates are well known as is their use as additives for lubricants and many methods have been proposed for their production the preferred techniques being the carbonation of an oil solution of a reaction mixture containing a sulphonic acid or sulphonate, an excess of a magnesium compound generally the alkoxide, oxide or hydroxide, usually a hydrocarbon solvent in the presence of reaction promoter systems often comprising an alcohol andlor water sometimes together with a co promoter. It is important that where the highly basic sulphonates are to be used as additives for lubricating oils they be not too viscous, are free of sediment, are soluble in the oil and do not cause the lubricating oil to be hazy. It is also preferred that they have as high aTotal Base Number TBN , being the number of milligrams of KOR equivalent to 1 gram of the product when titrated with strong acid, as possible since this results in the most economic use of the metal. It is also important that the compound perform well as an additive in an oil in use in an engine. Many of the earliest techniques proposed for producing magnesium sulphonates required magnesium metal as starting material, as for example in United States Patent 3158009. Since then various reaction promoter systems have been proposed for the production of basic magnesium sulphonates from magnesium oxide. For example, U.K. Patent 1166744 is concerned with the use of mixtures of alcohol, water and amines as promoters U.K. Patent 1297150 describes the use of oil soluble carboxylic acids and water whilst U.K. Patent 1399092 relates to the use of amine salts of carboxylic acids, alcohol and water. In each instance, specific process conditions have been proposed for the particular promoter each generally involving complex multi stage processes or undesirably expensive process conditions. There remains therefore a need for a simple economic process for the production of high TBN around 400 TBN magnesium sulphonates which is not dependent on the use of a particular promoter or complex reaction steps. The present invention therefore provides a process for the production of basic magnesium sulphonates comprising carbonating a mixture containing a an oil soluble sulphonate or sulphonic acid b a stoicheiometric excess of a magnesium compound above that required to react with a . c a hydrocarbon solvent. d a C1 to C5 alcohol and or a C3 to C6 ketone e water and f a reaction promoter wherein carbonation is effected between 50 C and the reflux temperature of the mixture and is continued until from 80 to 120 of the stoicheiometric amount of carbon dioxide required to react with the excess magnesium compound has been passed through the reaction mixture and for sufficient time to ensure that from 70 to 90 of the carbon dioxide theoretically required to convert the excess of the magnesium compound to magnesium carbonate has been absorbed by the reaction mixture. We have found that the use of these particular carbonation conditions allows high TBN around 400 products to be obtained without the need for the two stage processes as are described in U.K.Patents 1166744 and 1297150. In addition we find that these particular conditions enable one to use a variety of reaction promoters without the need to especially adjust the conditions according to the promoter.Furthermore our process has the economic advantage over processes such as the one of U.K. patent 1399092 in that unwanted volatile materials may be removed before filtration thus requiring filtration of a much smaller volume. We have found that the choice of temperature conditions used during carbonation is important to obtain a product of acceptable viscosity and filterability and that the reaction mixture should preferably be at a temperature in the range 500C to 650C at the start of carbonation and since the reaction between magnesium oxide and sulphonic acid is exothermic this should be allowed for during the process. We have also found that the temperature profile during carbonation contributes to the product properties and we prefer that the mixture be between 55 and 700C for from about 1 to 2 hours, be held at from 650C to 75 C for about a further 1 to 2 hours and be at a temperature between 700C and 550C during the remainder of carbonation. We find there is a tendency for products obtained outside this temperature profile to have an undesirably high sediment. The exact amount of carbonation will depend upon the specific nature of the reactants but the conditions are chosen so that from 70 to 90 of the excess of the magnesium compound present is converted to magnesium carbonate. If this amount is exceeded basic magnesium carbonate tends to be formed which deposits from the reaction mixture thus reducing the TBN of the product and impairing filterability. If less than 70 is converted to carbonate unreacted magnesium compound generally MgO remains which also tends to reduce filterability and also lowers the final TBN.We have found that this degree of carbonation may generally be obtained by carbonating for a period of more than 2 hours. Carbonation for more than 6 hours is economically undesirable. The sulphonate of sulphonic acid used in the process of this invention may be natural or synthetic, the synthetic alkylaryl sulphonates and sulphonic acids being preferred. The basic alkaline earth metal sulphonates with which this invention is concerned consist of an oil solution of the magnesium sulphonate which itself acts as a surfactant to disperse the excess alkaline earth metal which is present as colloil alkaline earth metal derivatives such as carbonate, oxide and hydroxide. Thus it is important that the sulphonate or sulphonic acid be oil soluble. The excess of the magnesium compound provides the basicity of the material and the amount of magnesium that should be used depends upon its quality and the desired TBN of the product. The excess may be achieved by starting with the sulphonic acid and adding an amount necessary to give the required excess after reaction with the acid or by starting with magnesium sulphonate and then adding the required excess. We prefer to use from 1 to 45 more preferably 1 to 25 equivalents of magnesium for each equivalent of sulphonic acid present in the reaction mixture, this would include magnesium present if a sulphonate is used as the starting material in which case the equivalents of sulphonic acid from which the sulphonate is derived would be number of equivalents of acid. The hydrocarbon solvent is used in an amount sufficient to keep the reaction mixture fluid during carbonation and may be aliphatic such as. hexane or heptane or aromatic such as benzene, toluene or xylene, toluene being the preferred solvent. We find that 5 parts by weight of hydrocarbon solvent per part of alkaline earth metal compound is particularly suitable. The amount of water that should be added will depend upon the amount of excess magnesium compound present. Where magnesium oxide is used we prefer to use from 0.5 to 2 parts by weight of water based on the total amount of magnesium oxide. The presence of the alcohol and or the ketone in the reaction mixture improves both the product and the reaction by enhancing the formation of the basic colloidal alkaline earth metal compound.Examples of suitable alcohols include ethanol and methanol, with acetone being the preferred ketone. As with the other ingredients the amount of alcohol and or ketone that should be used depends upon the amounts of the other ingredients, especially the amount of the excess of the alkaline earth metal compound. However, where magnesium oxide is the alkaline earth metal compound, we prefer to use from 0.5 to 4 more preferably 0.5 to 2 parts by weight of the alcohol and or ketone based on the total weight of the magnesium oxide. We have found that an additional reaction promoter should be present to achieve the desired high TBN. One benefit of our invention is that any of the previously proposed promoters may be used with our reaction conditions. Examples of reaction promoters that may be used include the famines described in U.K. patent 1166744, the oil soluble carboxylic acids of U.K. patent 1297150, the amine salts of acids described in U.K. patent 1399092 and the C4 to C6 diketones described in our copending application no 48322 78. Mixtures of these promoters may also be used. The amount of promoter that should be used depends upon the nature of the promoter, the nature of the magnesium compound and its quality and the TBN required.We prefer however to use from 0.02 to 1 parts by weight of promoter based on the total amount of the magnesium compound present. Our preferred promoter is ehtylene diamine. The addition of an oil soluble alkyl phenol to the reaction mixtures may also be useful in that it can give rise to product of improved viscosity. The alkyl phenols may be simple phenols, such as nonyl phenol, decyl and dodecyl phenol bridged phenols of the general formula EMI5.1 Where R is an alkyl group containing at least 8 carbon atoms, X is sulphur or CH2 and n is 1 or 2. The amount of the phenol that should be incorporated depends upon the nature of the other ingredients, but in our preferred process for the production of basic magnesium sulphonates from magnesium oxide, we prefer to use from 0 to 1 parts by weight based on the total weight of magnesium oxide present in the reaction mixture. It should be appreciated that within the ranges of amounts specified above the preferred amounts of materials to be used will depend upon the relative proportions of all the various components in the reaction mixture. Although the order in which the components are charged to the reaction vessel is not critical we prefer that the sulphuric acid, the hydrocarbon solvent, the C1 to C5 alcohol or C3 to C6 ketone and the magnesium compound be mixed first so that the magnesium compound and the sulphuric acid can react before introduction of the promoter. After carbonation the product is stripped to remove the volatile materials such as alcohol and or ketone, water, promoter Cohere volatile and solvent and the remaining solids in the reaction mixture are removed preferably by filtration or centrifugation. Although the product may be stripped first and then filtered or vice versa it is an economic advantage of our invention that volatiles may be removed before filtration so reducing the volume to be filtered. Further carbon dioxide may be passed through the reaction mixture during stripping. The final product is thus obtained as an oil solution of the basic alkaline earth metal sulphonate. The magnesium sulphonates obtained from the process of the present invention are useful as additives for lubricants where their basicity neutralises acids formed by the operation of the engine and the surfactant part of the compound helps disperse unwanted residues in the oil to reduce the formation of harmful deposits and enhances the antirust properties of the lubricant. The basic magnesium sulphonates of this invention may be used in a wide variety of lubricating oils. The oils may be natural or synthetic or mixtures thereof and the main uses are in crankcase lubricants, two cycle and aviation lubricants. The amount of the sulphonate that should be included in the oil depends upon the type of oil concerned and its application. For crankcase oils, we prefer to use from 0.01X to 5 wit. based on the weight of the oil. The sulphonates may be used in combination with other conventional additives for lubricating oils such as for example other highly basic metal additives particularly other alkaline earth metal sulphonates and alkaline earth metal phenates and sulphurised phenates. In addition the oils may contain ashless dispersants such as the products obtained by the reaction of polyamines or polyols with polyisobutylene succinic anhydride and anti oxidants, antiwear agents and anti corrosion additives such as the well known zinc dialkyldithiophosphates. The oils may also containiviscosity index modifiers such as the well known olefine copolymers. The present invention is illustrated but in no way limited by reference to the following examples in which a reaction mixture was prepared at room temperature in a flask fitted with a reflux con 0 denser, heated to 60 C and Carbon dioxide introduced into the reaction mixture. After the desired amount of carbon dioxide had been introduced carbonation was stopped and the temperature of the mixture raised to 1500C and stripped under a vacuum of 20 mm of mercury to remove the volatile materials. The mixture was then cooled and filtered to yield an oil solution of the required basic magnesium sulphonate. EXAMPLE 1 81.6 grams of a 90 wit. active ingredient oil solution of a C24 branched chain alkyl benzene sulphonic acid, and 51.1 grams of magnesium oxide, 95.6 grams of a paraffinic mineral oil of viscosity 90 centistokes at 1000F, 256 grams of Toluene, 35 grams of methanol, 28.7 grams neo decanoic acid and 45.0 grams of water were carbonated under different conditions with the following results Carbonation Product Conditions 1 95 cc s minute TBN 376 mg Kollig For 3 hours Highly Viscous 70Z of stoicheiometric 2 137 cc s minute TBN 424 mg KoH g For 3 hours stoicheiometric 3 137 cc s minute TBN 250 mg KoH g For 6 hours 200 stoicheiometric The theoretical TBN of each run was the same showing that magnesium had been deposited during run 3. Amount of carbon dioxide passed through. EXAMPLE 2 The process 2 of Example 1 was repeated using different reaction promoters and the quantity of diluent oil was varied according to the amount of promoter used. The results were as follows Promoter Grams Diluent TBN Oil moh R A Ethylene Diamine 5.0 453 Formic Acid 8.0 111.3 B Ethylene Diamine 5.0 119.3 403 C Ethylene Diamine 5.0 111.3 416 Acetyl Acetone 8.0 D Neo Decanoic Acid 28.7 95.6 424 In all instances the product could be filtered after removal of the volatile materials. EXAMPLE 3 For the sake of comparison the reaction mixture of A of Example 2 was stirred at ambient temperature for 10 minutes and the temperature then increased to 270C. Ethylene diamine diformate was prepared according to U.S. patent 3857790 and added to the mixture whose tempe 0 rature rose to 33 C. Carbon dioxide was then injected into the mixture at a rate of 692 cc minute for one hour corresponding to a 50Z excess over that required to react with the excess magnesium oxide . It was found that only 21 grams of carbon dioxide were absorbed, after removal of the volatiles filtration was poor and the product had a TEN of 253 mg RoH g. When however, the mixture was heated to 600C prior to carbonation and carbonate at a rate of 137 cc minute for 3 hours as in A ofExample 2 38 grams of carbon dioxide were absorbed. After removal of the volatiles the product was clear filtered rapidly and had a TBN of 453 mg KoH g. EXAMPLE 4 276.2 grams of a 70 active ingredient oil solution of a C24 branched chain alkyl benzene sulphonic acid, 214 grams paraffinic mineral cil 640 grams of toluene and 9 7 grams of methanol were mixed and stirred with 124 grams of magnesium oxide. When neutralisation of the sulphonic acid was complete, 12.5 grams of ethylene diamine, 113 grams of water and 78.3 grams of methanol were added, the temperature adjusted to 560C and carbonation started at a rate of 256 cc minute. After 30 minutes carbonation the temperature was adjusted to 700C and carbonation continued for a further 3 hours 36 minutes. The product filtered well after removal of volatile materials, had a low viscosity and a TBN of 423 mg KOH gram. The process described above was repeated except that the temperature was held at 55 C for 1 hour 30 minutes and then raised to 70 C for a further 1 hour 30 minutes, the final product could be filtered very quickly. Similar preparations were made keeping the temperature constant throughout carbonation by cooling and or heating with the following results Temperature 450C Product highly viscous and solvent could not be stripped 500C Product of high viscosity and filtration slow 550C Fast filtration 600c Solvent removal difficult due to foaming. 650C Higher sediment, poor filtration and solvent removal very difficult due to foaming.
