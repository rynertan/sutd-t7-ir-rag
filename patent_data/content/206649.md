# Photoelectric converting device.

## Abstract
A photoelectric converting device is provided with photo electric converting cells. Each cell is provided with a semi conductor transistor and a capacitor. The transistor is com posed of two main electrode semiconductor areas 15, 4 of a conductivity type and a control electrode semiconductor area 9 of opposite conductivity type. The capacitor controls the potential of said control electrode area in a floating state. The cell is capable of an accumulating operaton for accumulating photo induced carriers in said control electrode area, a read out operation for reading an output controlled by a voltage generated by said accumulation, and a refreshing operation for dissipating the carriers accumulated in said control electrode area, by means of controlling the potential of said control electrode area in floating state through said capacitor. The device comprises a semiconductor area 33 of a high concen tration and of a same conductive type as that of said control electrode area in an element isolation area which is provided in said main electrode area for electrically isolating said photo electric converting cells, thereby constituting a transistor structure in combination with said control electrode area.
