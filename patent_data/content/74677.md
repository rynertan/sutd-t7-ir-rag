# Method and device for transferring and fixing of powder images.

## Abstract
Method in which a powder image which is formed on an intermediate support 1 is made sticky and subsequently under the influence of pressure is transferred onto a paper receiving support and fixed thereon. The intermediate support 1 has a hydrophobic surface and the image powder absorbs water and softens on absorbing water. After image formation the intermediate support 1 with the powder image adherent thereto is covered with water and directly after this a curved surface of a squeegee element 24 is rolled over the surface of the intermediate support 1 so as to dry the latter. In a device for performing the method the squeegee element is a roller 24 which is in pressure contact with the intermediate support 1 and which over a portion of its periphery is immersed in a water bath 25 .
