# Method of converting non ferrous metal mattes to the metal or metal sulphide.

## Abstract
A method of converting a charge of non ferrous metal matte in a Pierce Smith or similar converter. The fluid charge is blown with a total flow of oxidizing gas effective to maintain autogenous converting temperatures through a plurality of spaced apart tuyeres limited in number and individual cross sectional area effective to maintain the gas underexpanded at a pressure within the range from about 50 to about 150 psig so that it penetrates the bath in the form of discrete steady jets to positions remote from the tuyere tips thereby reducing degradation of the refractories and build up of accretions. The gas is injected through from three to six tuyeres.
