# Scaffold joint for a scaffold structure.

## Abstract
A scaffold joint for connecting the ends of horizontal scaffold members 18 to vertical scaffold members 20 . Spaced pairs of ring support members 22 are fastened to the vertical scaffold members by welding or other suitable means. End connector assemblies 16 are fastened to the ends of the horizontal scaffold members. Each of said end connector assemblies includes an end connector member 24 and a locking member 26 slidably mounted thereon. Each end connector member has a pair of ring engaging portions 30 adapted for engagement with the spaced ring support members on said vertical scaffold members. The locking members are adapted when moved to their locked position to make tight wedging contact with a ring support member, thereby causing the ring engagement portions on the end connector members to be forced into tight engage ment with the ring support members to thereby lock the horizontal scaffold members to the vertical scaffold mem bers.
