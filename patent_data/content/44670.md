# Heating systems.

## Abstract
A heating system of the type having a combustion chamber 20 with a fuel burner 40 , an inlet 22 for combustion air and an exhaust stack 80 is improved by adding a variable speed induced draft blower 62 , a flow restricting stack orifice 70 and a fuel valve 100 sensitive to the exhaust gas flow rate through the stack orifice. The fuel valve turns on at a first predetermined exhaust gas flow rate and turns off at a second predeter mined exhaust gas flow rate, which is lower than the first predetermined rate. The fuel valve also supplies fuel at a rate proportional to the exhaust gas flow rate. Sensing of the differential pressure across the stack orifice is used to determine the exhaust gas flow rate.
