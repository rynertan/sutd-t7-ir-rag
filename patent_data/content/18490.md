# Direct current gas discharge display panels.

## Abstract
In a direct current gas discharge panel, the cathode con ductors 4 are protected from ion bombardment by a refrac tory oxide MgO double isolating layer 10, 12 the outer portion 10 , from 2,000 Å to 3,000 Å thick, being doped with from 10 to25 by volume of a noble metal, the inner portion 12 , from 100 Å to 10,000 Å thick, being not so doped. The anode conductors 6 may be isolated by a single layer 13 which may be non stoichiometric and effectively form a resis tive part of the circuitry of the panel.
