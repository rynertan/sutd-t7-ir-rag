# Rotary coupler.

## Abstract
A rotary coupler is disclosed, in which a rotor 11, 411, 511 and a non rotor stator 12, 412, 512 are provided on their facing surfaces with microstrip lines 15, 16 115, 116 215, 216 415, 416 515, 516 which are disposed along circles concentric with the axis of the rotor 11, 411, 511 and facing one another. High frequency signals are transferred between the microstrip line 15, 115, 215, 315, 415, 515 on the side of the rotor 11, 411, 511 and the mi crostrip line 16, 116, 216, 316, 416, 516 on the side of the non rotor 12, 412, 512 .
