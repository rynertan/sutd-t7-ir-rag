# Weft feeder for weaving looms.

## Abstract
Weft feeder for weaving looms, of the type wherein the drum 1 around which the weft yarn winds to form the re serve is held stationary, while the turns 3 of said reserve are laid thereon by a rotating reel 2 and are moved for ward, mutually spaced, by a set of columns 5 prevented from rotating in respect of said drum 1 , but partially and variably emerging from special seats of its periphery. The ensemble of said columns has a frustoconical profile, each column 5 being tapered towards the feeder outlet end, un til it no longer emerges from said seats where there is maxi mum tapering. A photoelectric cell unit 8 , moving parallely to the axis of the drum 1 , detects the presence and the con sistency of the weft yarn reserve wound thereon, in order to control the rotation and regulate the speed of the motor of said feeder.
