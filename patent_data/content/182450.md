# Method and apparatus for restructuring debt obligations.

## Abstract
Methods and apparatus for restructuring one or more debt obligations issued in the form of interest bearing bonds into a serial issue of zero coupon bonds. The data processing system evaluates the cash flows and present value of an existing bond, then creates a serial issue of zero coupon bonds which provides pretax cash flows equivalent to those of the existing bond and determines a table of call yields for the serial issue of zero coupon bonds to replace the table of call prices for the old bond. The system evaluates the after tax cash flows, and determines the after tax present value to the issuer of the existing bond and the serial issue of zero coupon bonds. The system periodically determines the potential savings from calling the zero coupon bond issue, or selected bonds from the series, and refinancing the debt at the prevailing interest rates.
