# Method of switching bottom blown gases and apparatus therefor.

## Abstract
A method of switching bottom blown gases and an apparatus suitable for putting such a method into practice by the successive blowing of a plurality of gases through a piping system into molten steel in a steel making furnace through tuyeres 4 or porous plugs for gas blowing located in a lower portion of the steel making furnace. The method includes the step of directly releasing into the atmosphere at least a portion of the gas flowing in and through the piping system in response to a rise in pressure of the gas when the blown gases are switched. Release into the atmosphere is stopped either after a predetermined period of time or when the gas pressure in the piping system drops below a predetermined level.
