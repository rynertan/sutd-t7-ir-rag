# EXPANDED PARTIAL RESPONSE PROCESSING FOR ANALOG SIGNAL ENCIPHERING AND THE LIKE

## Abstract
Partial response signal processing is applied to samples of an analog signal quantized in an amplitude range having a sufficient number of levels that a sample amplitude error of a small percentage of the total levels of the range is not readily perceptible to the human auditory function and that it exhibits tolerable quantizing noise. Samples received into the process ing in a transmitting station are sample masked 20 for privacy enciphering. Complementary processing 30, 32 is employed for a receiving station.
