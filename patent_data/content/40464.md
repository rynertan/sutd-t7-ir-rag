# A fluid bearing.

## Abstract
A fluid bearing comprises orifices 14 in fluid communi cation between a cavity 12 containing pressurised fluid in the periphery of the fluid bearing to support a flexible magne tic tape 16 under tension, and a tension sensor having a chamber 20 within the fluid bearing, a pressure transducer 28 for sensing the pressure of the fluid within the chamber 20 , a first metered orifice 24 providing fluid communication between the chamber 20 and the periphery of the bearing, and a second metered orifice 22 providing fluid communica tion between the chamber 20 and the source 12 of pressur ised fluid, so that the pressure transducer provides an indica tion of the tension in the tape.
