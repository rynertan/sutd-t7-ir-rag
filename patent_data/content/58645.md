# Infrared radiation detector device.

## Abstract
Multielement infrared radiation detector device with high feed through package density and low thermal loss. The invention concerns a device for the detection of infrared radiation, comprising a photosensitive component which consists of an elevated number of elements operating at low temperatures and comprising a vacuum tight embodi ment which is characterized by a very high electrical feed through package density, low thermal loss, high com pactness and ruggedness, low production costs and which offers a high degree of industrial standardization.
