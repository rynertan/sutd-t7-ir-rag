# Ink additives for thermal ink transfer printing processes.

## Abstract
By adding an aromatic azido compound which exo therms at the conditions of thermal ink transfer to a thermal transfer ink, an improved thermal transfer ink and thermal transfer ink process are achieved. Thus, the disclosure is an improvement in a thermal transfer ink composition, which comprises thereto of an aromatic azido compound which exotherms at the conditions of thermal ink transfer.
