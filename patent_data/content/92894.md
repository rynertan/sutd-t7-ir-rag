# Method for repairing glass fiber reinforced plastic parts.

## Abstract
Surface defects in a cured, molded thermoset fiberglass reinforced FRP part can be repaired by filling the defect or void with an excess of a thermosetting conductive repair material, applying pressure and heat sufficient to cure said material without substantial shrinkage of said material, removing the pressure, cooling and finishing said parts to the original surface contour. The repair material includes a polyurethane acrylate, an epoxy acrylate or an unsaturated polyester oligomer, three ethylenically unsaturated compo nents copolymerizable with the oligomer, one of which is an acrylate and another of which has a CO group and a NHâ‚‚, NH and or OH group, release agents, an initiator, an accelerator, a low profile additive and filler materials, one of which is conductive.
