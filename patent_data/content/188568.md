## Description
This invention provides a method of developing radiation sensitive negative resists in a manner which produces a developed resist free from swelling, profile distortion and line distortion. The resist polymer is applied to the surface of the semiconductor wafer using one of the standard methods of application such as spin coating. The film of resist polymer covering the semiconductor surface is then exposed to radiation from a source such as electron beam, ion beam, or X ray in order to create the desired resist pattern or image within the film. In the case of a negative resist, the pattern is in the form of a crosslinked polymer which is less soluable than the surrounding nonexposed polymeric material. The pattern or image is subsequently developed by removal of the more soluble, nonexposed polymeric film via use of a solvent. When images with narrow lines, especially lines less than one micrometer in width, such as those created by electron beam exposure, are developed in negative resists, there is a pronounced tendency for the lines and edges to undergo a characteristic sinusoidal deformation that can be named snaking. Other observers have described this line phenomenon as sinuous lines, or scriggily lines, or wavy lines. These snaky lines form lateral filaments, in some instances which cause bridging of the adjacent lines in severe cases, snaky lines may not only bridge but merge. It has been observed that the developed negative resist is swollen and is thicker higher than the thickness elevation of the initial resist layer. This increased thickness may introduce undesirable anomalies into the developed resist a developed resist having substantially the thickness of the initial resist layer is preferred.

Miller, mixtures of a good solvent combined with a poor or nonsolvent are utlized to develop the image in order to reduce distortion or the developed image. After development, the imaged polymer is rinsed with a material which is a nonsolvent for the polymer, but which has affinity for the developer solvent. Use of such rinse reduces the amount of residual developer solvent in the imaged polymer and thus minimizes the distortion of the developed image from the initial image prior to development. P. C. Deb and S. R. Palit reported the use of a mixture of two nonsolvents to dissolve a polymer in IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin, Vol. 18, No. 2, July 1975, page 393 discloses developing the exposed resist layer of an acrylate polymer by a mixture of nonsolvents. The mixture is comprised e. g. of methylalcohol and n amylacetate, i. e. an ester. IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin, Vol. 18, No. 3, August 1975, page 715 discloses the resist development of vinylpolymer resists with an azeotropic mixture of aqueous or non aqueous solvents. Though cellosolves are mentioned by said document, the additive such as cellosolve must be admixed with the developer compound. The cellosolves are used to delute the developer to reduce the dissolving power of the developer solvent. The present invention provides a further improvement in the wet development of irradiated negative resists, so that a developed image is produced which is substantially undistorted from the initial image prior to development. Accordingly, the primary purpose of this invention is to provide a method for obtaining a developer solvent for radiation sensitive nagative resists which provides dissolution of the non crosslinked resist polymer, but which exhibits limited diffusion into the crosslinked resist polymer. Diffusion into the crosslinked resist polymer must be limited such that swelling, profile distortion, surface erosion and line irregularity of the developed image are substantially eliminated. This primary purpose is achieved by the process of the main claim. Preferred embodiments of the present invention are claimed in the subclaims. The sole figure is a graph showing the relative solubility of poly 2,6 dichlorostyrene in various solvents, particularly as correlated with the solubility parameter, δ, and the hydrogen bonding index, γ. The submicron lithographic process of the invention utilizes a negative resist polymer positioned on a suitable substrate. Illustrative substrates are glassy materials such as silicon oxide, glass, polyimides, ceramics, metals, and semiconductors such as silicon and III V matrials such as GaAs . The negative resist polymer of the wet submicron lithographic process of the invention is selected from the group consisting of a polystyrene b halogenated polystyrene and c substituted styrene polymer having at least one substituent, where the substituent s is selected from the group consisting of alkyl having 1 4 carbon atoms, halo, and haloalkyl having 1 4 carbon atoms and at least one halo, and mixtures thereof. The negative resist polymer is applied to the surface of the substrate directly, or through an appropriate bonding agent layer, in any conventional manner suitable to the particular polymer, to obtain a resist polymer coating on the substrate normally a wafer . The resist polymer is irradiated in the desired pattern to obtain a latent image therein, by any suitable means such as electron beam, ion beam, X ray, or U.V. radiation. Irradiation of the negative resist polymer produces a latent image in the desired pattern. The latent image exists within the polymer film in the form of crosslinked polymer surrounded by areas of nonirradiated, non crosslinked polymer. The latent image is developed by treatment with a developer solvent which dissolves the non crosslinked polymer leaving the crosslinked polymer image on the surface of the substrate. In order to obtain a developed image which has not been swelled nor distorted by the development process, it is necessary that the developer solvent dissolve the non crosslinked polymer without diffusing into the crosslinked polymer. Accordingly, it has been discovered that when the developer solvent is comprised of at least two organic compounds, each of which, when applied singly, is a nonsolvent for the non crosslinked polymer, but which together are a solvent for such non crosslinked polymer, swelling of the developed resist is substantially reduced, indicating that diffusion of such developer solvent into the crosslinked polymer image is also substantially reduced. Relative solubility of polymers in various solvents has been correlated to several factors. Two of these factors are the solubility parameter, , and the hydrogen bondinng index, . Delta is derived from thermodynamics and is related to the molar heat of vaporization. Gamma is an arbitrary scale which relates to the ability of a solvent to form hydrogen bonds. Thus, hydrocarbons have low values while alcohols have relatively high values. Lists of and values for solvents are readily available in the literature. The and values for polymers can be determined by ordinary and standard experimentation, by determining the relative solubility of the polymer in different solvents. Values of δ and γ intermediate between those of pure solvents may be determined utilizing a mixture of solvents. The sole figure is a graph showing the relative solubility of poly 2,6 dichlorostyrene , a negative resist, in various solvents. The solubilities are expressed in terms of the solubility parameter, δ, and the hydrogen bonding index, γ. It was determined that the poly 2,6 dichlorostyrene was insoluble in cellosolve δ 9.9, γ 6.9 and insoluble in methyl cellosolve δ 10.2, γ 6.9 . Poly 2,6 dichlorostyrene was also determined to be insoluble in n heptane δ 7.3, γ 2.2 and cyclohexane δ 8.2, γ 2.2 . However, the poly 2,6 dichlorostyrene was found to be soluble within 60 seconds in a 1 1 mixture of cellosolve heptane δ 8.7, γ 4.5 and within 15 seconds in a 9 1 mixture of cellosolve heptane δ 9.6, γ 6.4 . Similar observations were made for other negative resist polymers such as poly 4 chlorostyrene and poly 4 bromostyrene which were discovered to be insoluble in individual solvents but soluble in mixtures of such solvents. Images produced using poly 2,6 dichlorostyrene or poly 4 chlorostyrene resist wherein the developer solvent was comprised of at least two organic materials, each of which, when applied singly, is a nonsolvent for the non crosslinked polymer, were superior to images produced when the developer solvent was a good solvent for the resist and a nonsolvent rinse was used to remove excess developer solvent from the crosslinked polymer image the technique used in the process described in U.S. patent application, Serial No. 491,634, previously discussed . It is possible to use a nonsolvent rinse to remove excess developer solvent when the developer solvent has been comprised of a mixture of two nonsolvents in accordance with the process of the present invention. When this is done, the nonsolvent rinse is preferably an alkane or cycloalkane. There may be a benefit to using a nonsolvent rinse when the developer solvent has a greater tendency to diffuse into the crosslinked polymer image, for example, in cases of lower molecular weight resists or resists having a lower density of crosslinking. The discussion above describes the use of developer solvents comprised of a mixture of at least one alcohol and at least one alkane or cycloalkane. It was discovered that alcohols wherein the alcohol molecule contained no ether group could not be combined with the alkane or saturated aromatic molecule to produce a developer solvent for halogenated polystyrene negative resists alcohols wherein the alcohol molecule contained one ether group could be used to produce a developer solvent mixture and alcohols wherein the alcohol molecule contained at least two ether groups were frequently solvents individually for the halogenated polystyrene negative resist. Examples of alcohols wherein the alcohol molecule contains one ether group include 2 methoxyethanol, 2 ethoxyethanol, 2 methoxypropanol, 3 methoxypropanol, 3 ethoxypropanol, and 3 ethoxypropanol. Such examples are not all inclusive, and one skilled in the art can produce a long listing of alcohol molecules containing one ether group which should perform adequately. The following table contains a listing of developer solvent mixtures and dissolution times for some of the halogenated polystyrene resists. A silicon wafer coated with a 2,500 Å thick poly 2,6 dichlorostyrene negative resist was exposed with a scanning electron beam at a series of increasing dosages to produce images and these images were developed using a mixture of 2 ethoxyethanol n heptane. The imaged resist film upon the wafer substrate was immersed in a 9 1 mixture of ethoxy ethanol heptane for 20 seconds followed by a second immersion into a fresh mixture of the same solvents at the same ratio for a period of ten seconds. While the developed resist was still wet, it was rinsed for 30 seconds with heptane to remove any of the solvent mixture remaining on the surface of the resist then the resist was blown dry with dry nitrogen. The lines which had been exposed to a dose of 60 µC cm and which made up the patterned image after development looked straight, and the cross sectional profile was undistorted from the image prior to development. The developed image from the above process appeared to be better than those developed using a good solvent such as cellosolve acetate and subsequently rinsed using a cellosolve isopropyl alcohol mixture. The latter development process is illustrative of the method described in U.S. patent application, Serial No. 491,636, discussed earlier. A silicon wafer coated with a 8,800 Å thick film of poly 4 chlorostyrene was exposed to a scanning electron beam at a series of increasing dosages and developed using a mixture of ethoxyethanol methylcyclohexane. The imaged resist film upon the wafer substrate was immersed in a 1 1 mixture of ethoxyethanol methylcyclohexane and then blown dry using dry nitrogen. The lines which had been exposed to a dose of 2.51 µC cm and which made up the patterned image after development were straight when observed under the optical microscope. Previous experience had shown that development of this same resist with a good solvent such as ethoxy ethylacetate followed by use of nitrogen to blow dry the resist surface resulted in sinuous, wavy lines.
