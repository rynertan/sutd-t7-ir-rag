# Aromatic polyamide composition.

## Abstract
An aromatic polyamide composition usable for produc ing shaped articles, for instance, filaments, comprises the components of an aromatic polyamide resin P , a polar amide solvent S and an auxiliary solvent H consisting of a halogenated hydrocarbon, for example, dichloromethane and dichloroethane, the proportions of the components P , S and H being on or within a quadrilateral A C D E dfined by the co ordinates A P 5.0, S 30.0, H 65.0 C P 45.0, S 30.0, H 25.0 D P 57.0, S 38.0, H 5.0 and F P 5.0, S 90.0, H 5.0 . The composition also contains a solubility enchancing agent consisting of one or more inorganic halide, such as alkali metal halides, alkaline earth metal halides and am monium holides, in amount of from 5 to 60 , based on the weight of the polyamide resin.
