# Pattern position recognition apparatus.

## Abstract
The apparatus has an image pickup section 3 for picking up an image of a pad pattern on a IC chip 8. Image signals from the image pickup section 3 are binary coded in a signal pro cessing system 4. The binary coded signals are subjected to a first slice level, to produce an image ofthe IC chip as shown in Figure 2C. The position of the IC chip 8 is detected by a chip position detecting system 5, and in dependence upon the detected position of the chip 8 the position of a view window 11 is determined by view window determining circuit 6. A pad pattern to be identified is caught in the view window 11 and image signals representing the image in the view window 11 are binary coded by the signal processing system 4, but are subjected to a different slice level. On the basis of the binary coded and slice signals, pad pattern identifying system 7 recognises the position of the pad pattern in the view window 11.
