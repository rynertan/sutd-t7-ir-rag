# Circuit arrangement for operating a high pressure discharge lamp.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a matching circuit arrangement for operating a high pressure discharge lamp, this circuit arrangement being provided with two input terminals for connection to a supply source, each of which is connected to a respective output terminal, these output terminals being intended for connection of the high pressure discharge lamp, a controlled semiconductor switching element A having a thyristor characteristic being included in a connec tion between an input terminal and a respective output terminal. A control electrode AS of the switching element A is connected to a main electrode BE2 of a controlled semiconductor switching element B having a thyristor characteristic. The main electrode AE2 of the switching element A is connected together with the main electrode BE1 of the switching element B to the input terminal. The main electrode AE1 of the switching element A is connected to the output terminal. The control electrode BS of the switch B is connected to a voltage divider circuit between the input terminals. In this configuration, during operation of the lamp, the lamp current will flow substantially solely via the switching element A and the housing of A can be directly contacting the input terminal, which is favourable for a satisfactory cooling of A.
