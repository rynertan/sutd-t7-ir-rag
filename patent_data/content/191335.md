## Description
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of 6R tetrahydro L biopterin represented by the following general formula I more specifically to an industrial preparation process which can provide the 6R form of tetrahydro L biopterin in a high proportion. Tetrahydro L biopterin hereinafter abbreviated as BPH₄ contains two isomers, i.e., the 6R and 6S forms depending on the steric configuration of hydrogen at the 6 position Furrer, H.J., et al. Helv. Chim. Acta. Of the two stereoisomers, 6R BPH₄ is a coenzyme not only for phenylalanine hydroxylases but also for aromatic amino acid hydroxylases. Its shortage thus leads to scarceness in neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine, noradrenalin and adrenalin, thereby inducing serious neuroses. Malignant hyperphenylalaninemia is a serious and incurable disease which is one of inborn errors of metabolism and cannot be easily treated by any conventional pharmacotherapy. This disease is also known to occur as a result of inhibition of conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine due to scarceness of 6R BPH₄. It may be contemplated to administer 6R BPH₄ for the treatment of malignant hyperphenylalaninemia. For this application, it has been desired to develop a process for economical preparation of this compound with high purity. As preparation processes of tetrahydro L biopterin, it has been known to reduce L erythro biopterin enzymatically or chemically. Of these processes, the enzymatic process is unavoidably accompanied by such a drawback that it requires complex facilities and operation, results in a high preparation cost and is hence disadvantageous as an industrial process, although it has a merit that it provides the 6R form only. On the other hand, the chemical process yields a mixture of the 6R form and 6S form, which must be separated subsequently. This separation is however extremely difficult to achieve. No effective method has heretofore been known for their separation. Accordingly, it has long been desired to develop a process for synthesizing 6R BPH₄ in a high proportion, if possible, selectively. However, no satisfactory process has yet been found. With the foregoing circumstances in view, the present inventor have carried out an extensive research. As a result, it has been found that the asymmetric ratio R S can be significantly increased by subjecting L erythro biopterin or an acyl derivative thereof to catalytic reduction by a platinum base catalyst, in the presence of an amine and under specific conditions and moreover, the resultant reaction mixture having such a high R S ratio facilitates the separation and collection of 6R BPH₄ Accordingly, this invention provides a process for the preparation of, 6R tetrahydro L biopterin I , which comprises hydrogenating L erythro biopterin or an acyl derivative thereof in the presence of an amine or a quaternary ammonium compound other than said biopterin starting material which controls the pH of the reaction medium to within the range of 10 to 13 and a platinum based hydrogenation catalyst at a H₂ pressure of 0.981 bar 1 kg cm² or more, and in the event at least one acyl group remains in the hydrogenated biopterin product obtained, The present invention has succeeded in preparing 6R BPH₄, the chemical synthesis of which has heretofore been difficult, at a high asymmetric ratio R S and moreover with a high yield, and is hence an extremely valuable invention. Since the process of this invention makes use of an amine as a base, the process is free from admixture of any inorganic salt and can hence provide high purity crystals with ease. This is another advantageous feature of this invention. The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description and the appended claims. The reaction of the above process is represented by the following equation wherein R means H or acyl group. In order to practice the present invention, L erythro biopterin or its acyl derivative II is catalytically reduced with a platinum base catalyst in water, an alcohol or a mixed water alcohol solvent, which has in advance been adjusted to pH 10 13 with an amine. As the platinum base catalyst, may for example be mentioned platinum black, platinum oxide PtO₂ , platinum carbon Pt C , platinum alumina Pt alumina or the like. Of these, platinum black is particularly preferred in view of yield and asymmetric ratio. On the other hand, illustrative of the alcohol may include methanol, ethanol, methyl cellosolve, ethylene glycol and so on. As exemplary amines, may be mentioned primary amines such as methylamine, ethylamine, propylamine and cyclohexylamine secondary amines such as dimethylamine, diethylamine, dipropylamine, piperidine and morpholine tertiary amines such as trimethylamine, triethylamine and tripropylamine and quaternary amines such as tetramethylammonium hydroxide, tetraethylammonium hydroxide and tetrapropylammonium hydroxide. These amines may each be added in such an amount that the pH of the resulting reaction solution reaches pH 10 13. The presence of such an amine is essential in the present invention. Even if the pH is adjusted to the above described range by using another base, for example, an inorganic base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, the asymmetric ratio R S will be low and the yield will also be poor. The process of this invention may be carried out in accordance with a usual procedure for catalytic reduction. The reaction temperature may preferably be 10 C to 50 C, while the H₂ pressure may be preferably 1 kg cm² or higher with 10 to 100 kg cm² being especially preferred. In the above manner, 6R BPH₄ or its acyl derivative can be obtained with an asymmetric ratio of about 7 or greater. The acyl group or groups are usually removed in the above described reaction. When some of the acyl groups still remain, they can be removed with ease by hydrolyzing the reaction product with hydrochloric acid or the like. By recrystallizing the thus obtained reaction product, 6R BPH₄ can be isolated and obtained with high purity.
