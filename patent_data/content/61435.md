## Description
.Description of the invention entitled . HYDROTHERMEL STOVE This invention concerns a hydrothermal stove. To be more exact, it concerns a high yield stove which has been design .ed and embodied in the workshop of the author and which has..several uses. It can be used for heating the surroundings in which it .is located by means of radiation, for heating the convective .fluid which has to be circulated within suitable means that..radiate heat outside the stove, for heating washing water and .for cooking and or heating various substances.. Diverse kinds of hydrothermal stoves are knoan, and it is inown that, notwithstanding the improvements applied to them, .said kinds of stoves do not provide particularly high there al yields. This is especially due to the slow speeds of rotary flow..and circulation of fumes inside the combustion chamber, said speeds being determined substantially by the particular shape of said chamber. It follows that, so as to raise the calorific power of said stoves, it is necessary to increase the surface of the.thermally irradiated boiler, but this causes, unfortunately, an increase in the dimensions of a stove thus designed. Furthermore, it should also be noted that. in said known stoves, owing also to the particular shape of the boiler, in order to avoid the damaging formation of damp and therefore. of rust, constructional materials are widely employed which do not provide very good heat exchange, such as, for instan ce, refractory materials, cast iron and other products. This obviously leads to a reduction in the yield of said stove. The present invention tends to remedy such shortcomings and drawbacks by embodying a high yield hydrothermal stove.. In particular, the hydrothermal stove of the invention comprises conduits to convey water or convective fluid which are disposed or conformed, or shaped, so as to intercept and guide the flames and fumes of combustion along preferential paths in order to maximise the thermal yield of said stove according to the invention. The special disposition and conformation of said convey ing conduits enable the damaging formation of damp and therefore of rust to be avoided, particularly on said conduits which delimit the combustion chamber, during the phase of circulation of water or convective fluid. In this way the boiler can be embodied with materials able to provide excellent heat exchange. According to the invention various materials can be emp loyed and it has been noted that stainless steels are the materials which give a better general yield since they enable the thermal yield of the stove to be kept high. Moreover, the particular technical lay outs employed in this invention make it possible to embody a hydrothermal sto ve having a minimum overall size together with a maximum thermal yield of said stove. According to this invention the base supporting the wood or fuel to be burnt consists helpfully of a substantially level battery of tubes acting as a hydrothermal grate. moreover, according to the invention the conduit for fu .mes and the conduits for convective fluid enfold spaces or compartments inside the stove which are able to be used as ovens for cooking and heating. Furthermore, according to the invention the upper plate of the stove can be employed as a cooking plate. This invention, therefore, is embodied in a hydrothermal stove for household use, said stove being suitable for heating convective fluid and washing water and also for cookingfoodstuffs and substances in general and being characterized by including in mutual cooperation and coordination conduits for convective fluid which are disposed and con formed in such a way as to constitute a combustion chamber compartment and a sequence of interspaces that communicate with each other and form the conduit for fumes, a battery of tubes disposed within said combustion chamber and forming the supporting platform for the fuel, at least one conduit for heating washing water and possible compartments used as cooking ovens and enfold ed at least partially by said conduits for the fluid and or said conduit for fumes, whereby means to feed and convey a forced draught are comprised and cooperate with said combustion chamber, and whereby means to control and regulate the flow of convective fluid into the outside hydraulic circuit are included advantageous ly. We shall describe hereinafter, as a non restrictive example, a preferential embodiment and some embodying variants of the invention and shall refer to the attached tables, wherein ig.I gives a three dimensional diagrammatic view of the hydrothermal stove of the invention Fig.2 gives a three dimensional, cutaway, diagrammatic view of the boiler Fig. 3 shows a three dimensional view of an embodying variant of the boiler Fig,4 shows a broken down view of the hydrothermal stove ae cording to the variant shown in Fig.3 Fig.5 shows diagrammatically the means which control and re gulate the flow of convective fluid employed by the stove according to the invention Fig.6 shows an embodying variant of the invention. In the figures the same parts or parts performing the.same functions bear the same reference numbers. In particular, the hydrothermal stove IO shown in Figs.Iand 2 has an inner upper part in which the elements formingthe boiler II and delimiting the combustion chamber I2 are disposed said elements are the conduits for convective fluid 3 and the battery of tubes I4, whereby said conduits for convective fluid 13 in particular are made with materials able to provide excellent heat exchange, such as steel, for insta nce. In the lower inner part of said hydrothermal stove IO the means I5 are located which control and regulate Fig.5 theflow of the convective fluid to be circulated into the out side hydraulic conduits. The conduits for convective fluid I3 are conformed like a specially shaped panel provided with an interspace. In particular, the form of said specially shaped panels maRes it possible to embody a combustion chamber I2 having a substantially arched ceiling 16, and a suitable conduit for.fumes 17. It has been verified in the author s workshop that such a form of the combustion chamber I2 and, in particular, the arched shape of its ceiling I6 enable the turbulence of the fumes and their speed of rotary flow to be increased this leads to a greater radiation of heat towards the walls of said combustion chamber I2 than is obtained in stoves of the knows art, given the same unit of irradiated surface. There is the further advantage that complete combustion is obtained with such a type of chamber I2 without any waste of fuel. Such features lead substantially to a possible reduction in the sizes of the combustion chamber 12 and, therewith, of the whole hydrothermal stove IO, which nonetheless still retains a very high calorific power. Furtherotore, owing to said special shape of the arched ceiling I6 it is possible to cover the inner walls of the chamber 12 directly with the flames of combustion, a fact which enables the damaging formation of damp and therefore of rust on said walls to be prevented. Moreover, since the conduit for fumes 17 is delimited or.enfolded at least partially by the conduits for convective fluid I3, a continuous exchange of heat can take place be . tween said conduits 13 and 17. In effect, along the whole of its path inside the hydro thermal stove 10 the convective fluid also makes use of the.calorific power of the discharge fumes. The battery of tubes 14 arranged at the bottom of the corn bastion chamber 12 acts as a hydrothermal grate or support .ing base whereupon the wood or solid fuel to be burnt is put. Said battery of tubes I4 also enables the temperature of the convective fluid within the conduits 13 to be kept even, since said battery I4 is located in such a way as to connect hydraulically the front 3I3 and rear 413 conduits forming the boiler II. Beneath the battery of tubes I4 is a space I8 where a re movable tray 19 for collecting the ash can be lodged. In the figures the conduits 13 delimiting said combustion chamber I2 and conformed, as said earlier, like a specially.shaped panel having an interspace have been given differentreference numbers depending on the specific position they oe cupy. In particular, two conduits 113 2I3 are comprised which zre conformed like an arc shaped panel so as to form said arched ceiling 16 said conduits II3 2I3 are separated t their top so that between them there is an upper transverseopening 20 for the passage of fumes from the combustion cham er 12 into the discharge conduit I7. The combustion chamber I2 is delimited at its front and rear by the conduits for convective fluid 3I3 413, which are conformed like walls, whereby the front wall may include aninlet 21 of a size such as to permit ready introduction of the fuel. The conduit for fumes 17 comprises a substantially levelfirst tract 117 delimited below by the conduit 213 and above by the plate of the hydrothermal stove IO, and thereafter comprises a descending tract 217 delimited by the conduit . 2I3 and possibly by a conduit 5I3 shaped and disposed sub . stantially vertically. The lower end of the descending tract 217 communicates with the end rising tract 3I7 of the conduit for fumes I7, and said end tract 3I7 leads into the stack 24. Above the conduit 5I3 is a valve 25 which is able to con nect the tracts 217 and 3I7 of the conduit for fumes 17, whereby said valve 25 can be opened by hand 23 and or auto matically if the latter is the case, the signal for its ope ration can be monitored by a heat sensor located within theboiler II and in contact with the convective fluid. The opening of said valve 25 enables the combustion fumes to be introduced directly into the stack 24 so that they can be drain away more efficiently, particularly so at the time. when the hydrothermal stove IO is lit a butterfly valve 26can be envisaged as being in the stack 24 for this purpose . and can be operated by hand 27 or automatically, as in the .case of the valve 25. The valve 25 is closed so as to make the discharge fumesfollow a longer path 217 317 and thereby to increase the surface of the conduits I3 affected by heat exchange. The intensity of combustion can be regulated with means . 28 which deliver and convey a forced draught. Said delivery means 28 consist of a conduit 29 fig.4 disposed substantially beneath the boiler II so as to be able to communicate with the combustion chamber I2 in a semi pres surised form. Said conduit 29 is fed with hot air aspirated near the stove IO by suitable fan means 30, whereby said fan means 30 are actuated by suitable heat sensor controlling means and whereby said heat sensor can be located in the conduit for convective fluid I3 substantially near the point of emission of said fluid into the outside hydraulic circuit, said fan means 30 being actuated, moreover, in coordination with themechanical opening of the window 31. The opening of said window 31 is actuated by the same said heat sensor controlling means and said window 31 is disposed so as to shut off access to the conduit 29. The introduction and discharge of convective fluid into .and out of the boiler II take place through two sleeves 32 . 33 connected to said boiler II in its lower and upper partsrespectively, as shown in Fig.4. Within the interspace in the specially shaped panels forming the conduits for convective fluid 13 are located fur zither conduits 34 which are conformed coil uise or with ano ther like shape and are able to cause the circulation of any slashing water to be heated inside the hydrothermal stove IO and vhich comprise entry 35 and exit 36 conveyors, as shown in Fig.4. Said conduits 34 can be wholly immersed in the convective fluid and be separated from the inner walls of the conduit I3 or else can be secured to.the nnside of at least one of the walls. In the figures shown the boiler II has a plurality of .through holes of which the aperture can be regulated and whi ch are machined in the top of the conduit 2I3. Said through holes 37 enable the upper plate 22 of the hydrothermal stove 10 to be heated more efficiently whenever necessary.So as to reduce the loss of heat from the boiler II or to limit the consumption of energy, some refractory material is interposed in some zones between the boiler II itself and the outer containing structure 39 of the hydrothermal stove IO. Furthermore, said hydrothermal stove 10 comprises a lower compartment 40 for lodging the means I5 which control and re regulate the flow of convective fluid, said means 15 being, for instance, of the kind shown diagrammatically in the hydraul ic circuit of Fig. 5. In said Fig.5 the convective fluid 4I leaving the boiler. 11 is introduced once more, during the initial heating phase, into said boiler II through a one way valve 42. In this way the temperature of said convective fluid 41 is able to rise quickly and thus prevent the damaging form ation of damp on the walls of said boiler II. Vihen a pre set temperature, monitored inside the boiler II by a heat sensor 43, is exceeded, said sensor 43 causes a commutation valve 44 and pump means 45 to operate. The one way valve 42 is thus by passed and the convective fluid 4I can circulate within the outside hydraulic circuit46. The controlling and regulating means I5 also comprise an expansion tank 47 and or other possible safety valves so as to keep the pressure of the convective fluid 41 constant orto avoid dangerous excessive pressures within the hydrauliccircuit itself. Fig.5 also shows diagrammatically the coil shaped conduits 34 located inside the boiler II so as to enable the washing.water to be heated. The flow of washing water inside the conduits 34 can be . regulated with a valve operated by a sensor located inside .the boiler II, the purpose being to avoid possible dangerous overheating of the convective fluid 41 contained in said boil er II if ever the pump means 45 breaks down. Moreover, the hydrothermal stove IO includes a door 48 to shut the combustion chamber or hearth 12 and a door 49 to shut the lower compartment 40. Fig.6 shows an embodying variant of the invention compris ing a compartment 50 which can be used as a cooking oven and which is located in a space formed by a suitable enlargement of the descending tract 217 said variant of Fig.6 also comprises one or more compartments 51 located below said fore going compartment 50 but not particularly affected by radi ration of heat. Fig.6 envisages that the valve 25 is disposed so as to cause the compartment 50 to be enveloped wholly or partially, and perhaps in a differentiated manner, by the discharge fu mes. We have described here a preferential embodiment of the invention together with a variant, but other variants are possible for a technician in this field. Thus the Ehat,es and sizes can be changed and the batteryof tubes 14 can be disposed in a different way it is also possible to embody stove IO of which the structure or con formation are the counterpart of that shown in Figs.I, 2 3, the purpose being to enable said stove 10 to be fitted into.differently shaped surroundings. It is possible to envisage that the compartment 50 is used at least partially as a storage tank for washing water and is therefore connected hydraulically to the conduits 34 so as to enable a certain quantity of washing water to be pre heatedby the discharge fumes, thus permitting said water to be kept at a substantially constant temperature at its outlet. It is also possible to visualise that the water or cons vective fluid is pre heated, before being introduced into the boiler II through the sleeve 33, by being made to flow into a coil or suitable interspace made inside the stack 24 in this way the yield of the hydrothermal stove 10 is raised yet further. Again, it is possible to envisage that the conduits for convective fluid I3 are conformed with a plurality of con duits perhaps cooperÅatiag at least partially with baffle plate means. Moreover, it can be visualised that the conduit 34 is secured at its outside to a wall of the conduit for convective fluid 13. These and other variants are all possible for a technic ian in this field without departing thereby from the scope . of the idea of the solution. n
