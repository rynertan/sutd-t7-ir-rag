# METHOD OF PRODUCING APERTURES IN FIBRE REINFORCED ARTICLES SUCH AS HELICOPTER ROTOR BLADES

## Abstract
A method of producing apertures in fibre reinforced articles is described and consists of locally heating an area of the unconsolidated article and piercing the heat softened area using a tapered piercing tool. Following withdrawal of the tool, an aperture retaining means is inserted to retain the shape of the aperture during a subsequent consolidation operation. The method ensures that all of the strength bearing fibres are retained and also that none of the fibres is severed, and is particularly suited to the formation of attachment apertures at the root end of a helicopter rotor blade.
