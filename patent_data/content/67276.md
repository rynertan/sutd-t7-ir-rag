# Transistor with tunnel emitter and upper energy valley base.

## Abstract
In a transistor capable of operation at very high speed, the emitter comprises an outer region 8 having a normal energy level for charge carriers of the higher mobility type electrons and an inner region 9 providing a barrier having a height greater than the aforesaid normal energy level and being sufficiently thin to permit the higher mobility charge carriers to quantum mechanical tunnel therethrough. The base 3 has an upper energy valley for the injected charge carriers substantially at the aforementioned normal energy level in the outer region of the emitter and is sufficiently thin to permit rapid transport therethrough of the injected charge carriers. The collector comprises an inner region 12 provid ing a barrier having a height at least as high as the upper energy valley in the base and an outer region 13 having a normal energy level for the injected charge carriers lower than the normal energy level for those charge carriers in the outer region 8 of the emitter. Because the injected charge carriers cross the base in an upper energy valley, the probability of energy loss is reduced. The switching time of the transistor is of the order of 10 ¹² seconds.
