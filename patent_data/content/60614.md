# Earthworking apparatus.

## Abstract
The apparatus 10 includes a first member 34 which has a pin receiving portion 94 and a second member 36 which carries a lock pin assembly 42 . The first and second members 34, 36 are pivotally movable, one with respect to the other, and the lock pin assembly 42 serves to lock the members 34, 36 against move ment by engagement in an opening 96, 98, 100 in the pin receiving portion 94 . The lock pin assembly 42 is secured to an actuating means 46, 72 which moves the pin assembly 42 into and out of engagement with the openings in the pin receiving portion 94 . The first and second members 34, 36 are subjected to severe loading and vibrations which attempt to move the se cond member 34 with respect to the first member 36 . The lock pin assembly 42 resists the loading and vi brations and isolates the moving means 44 from bend ing loads imposed upon the pin assembly 42 by being attached to the actuating means 46, 72 so as to provide for limited radial and axial movement of the pin 48 re lative to the actuating means.
