# PROGRAMMABLE LOGIC ARRAY

## Abstract
A single plane programmable logic array PLA using dynamic CMOS logic has switching transistors 14 located at specific locations within a row column matrix. The transistors 14 within a column 10 are series connected and have their gates common connected in rows 12 . PMOS and NMOS control transistors 16, 18 conduct exclusively to connect output J, K, L, M and input E, F, G, H ends of the columns 10 respectively to logic 1 or logic 0 in successive phases of a common clock CLK . Control inputs A, B, C, D are applied to specific rows 12 . By applying data inputs I₁, I₂, I₃, I₄ to column input ends E, F, G, H and interconnecting all the column output ends, the PLA is configured to function as a multiplexer. By setting the column input ends E, F, G, H to logic 0 and selectively interconnecting output ends of the columns, the PLA is configured to perform other combina tional logic functions.
