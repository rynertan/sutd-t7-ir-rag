# Electric transformer.

## Abstract
The invention relates to transformers and has par ticular applicability to high current furnace transformers. The transformer tank 7 has an opening 9 substan tially closed with a conductive panel 11 which is insulated from the tank, the coil terminal leads 31, 33 of one polarity extending outwardly of the tank through the panel in in sulated relationship with respect to the latter, and the coil terminal leads 35 of opposite polarity being electrically connected to the conductive panel, whereby eddy loss re sulting from current passing through the panel is greatly reduced. Furthermore, the terminal leads 35 of said op posite polarity are connected to the conductive panel through a conductive tubular structure 17 which surround the first mentioned terminal leads 31, 33 to provide mag netic shielding.
