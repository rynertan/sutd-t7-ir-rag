# SOLAR REFLECTOR

## Abstract
A solar reflector 12a, 12b is set forth. A longitudinally extending frame structure 14 includes first 28 and second 30 frame end closures 28, 30 . A first form member 32a, 32b is attached in board of the first end closure 28 . A second form member 34a, 34b is generally parallel to the first form member 32a, 32b and in board of the second end closure 30 . The first 32a, 32b and second 34a, 34b form members 32a, 32b, 34a, 34b have peripheries 36a, 36b, 38a, 38b having identical form surfaces 40a, 40b, 42a, 42b along portions thereof. A support member 44a, 44b is attached to a respective one 30 or 34a, 34b of the second end closure 30 and the second form member 34a, 34b and extends toward a respective other thereof. The port member 44a, 44b is adapted for transferring the weight of the second form member 34a, 34b to the second end closure 30 . A flexible sheet 60a, 60b of a material having a reflective in facing surface 62 and having opposite edges 64, 66 is provided which is adapted for attachment to the identical form surfaces 40a, 40b, 42a, 42b . The flexible sheet 60a, 60b has lateral edges 68, 70 generally perpendicular to the first and second frame members 32a, 32b, 34a, 34b . A securing struc ture 72a, 72b, 74a, 74b is provided for securing the opposite edges 64, 66 of the flexible sheet 60 to the identical form surfaces 40a, 40b, 42a, 42b . The sheet 60 is stretched between the form members 32a, 32b, 34a, 34b . An easy to assemble and relatively light solar reflector 12a, 12b is thus provided.
