## Description
The present invention relates generally to the field of semiconductor device processing, and more specifically to a method for forming narrow resist lines on the surface of a substrate. The invention also comprises a photolithographic process for producing narrow trench isolations. In recent years, optical photolithography has been used widely in the semiconductor manufacturing field. In optical photolithography, a semiconductor substrate is covered with a photoresistive polymer layer. A mask is placed above the photoresist layer, and ultraviolet light is projected onto the photoresist layer through the mask. If the photoresist is positive those portions of the photoresist not covered by the mask undergo a chemical reaction such that the exposed regions are more soluble in a developer solvent than the unexposed regions. Conversely, if the photoresist is negative , the regions of the photoresist not covered by the mask undergo a cross linking reaction, which increases the molecular weight of the exposed regions and makes them less soluble in a developer than the unexposed regions. In either case, the photoresist layer is then developed in a solvent. The solvent removes the less soluble regions of the photoresist i.e., the exposed regions if the photoresist is positive and the unexposed regions if it is negative , leaving behind portions of the photoresist i.e., resist lines which serve as a mask for subsequent semiconductor processing. Image reversal is a specific photolithographic process in which positive photoresist patterns are reversed to form negative resist patterns. In image reversal, a positive photoresist having a chemical additive for image reversal is masked and exposed as explained above to produce exposed regions of lower solubility and unexposed regions of higher solubility. The photoresist layer is then baked and blanket exposed such that the initially unexposed layers are now more soluble than the initially exposed layers. Thus, upon subsequent development in a solvent, the positive photoresist acts as a negative photoresist. Examples of image reversal processing appear in U.S. Patents 3,264,104 and 4,104,070 Hamel et al, Image Reversal Lift Off Process , H. Moritz Process for Providing Fine Lines , IBM TDB, Vol. 25, No. 9, February 1983, p. 4740 describes a process useful for boundary, e.g., isolation, schemes in semiconductors which improves the resolution of an optical printer for semiconductor circuits beyond the resolution limit of the printing tool. The resolution improvement is achieved by exposing and developing a first photoresist coating in the conventional positive mode and then applying image reversal after exposure of a second photoresist coating through a common mask. The photoresist used in each of the coatings and contains an additive, such as imidazole, to provide image reversal. In view of the trend in the art toward packing more transistors on less chip space, it has become necessary to produce resist lines having widths in the micron and sub micron range. Difficulty has been encounted in using optical photolithographic processes to manufacture such narrow lines. The usual procedure has been to mask the photoresist with a masking element having a series of narrow mask lines i.e., lines having widths in the micron and sub micron range . Such a masking element is difficult to manufacture, and its extreme fragility renders it hard to work with. Furthermore, even if one were to use such a mask in a conventional photolithographic process, it is possible that these narrow mask lines would not produce a sufficient exposure contrast to produce narrow resist lines on the substrate. Thus, specialized projection tools have to be used in conjunction with these fragile masking elements in order to promote sufficient exposure contrast. A need has evolved in the art for an optical photolithographic manufacturing process in which narrow resist lines can be produced without the use of a fragile masking element or specialized projection tools. This process would be especially useful where the narrow resist lines are reversed and used to form narrow trench isolation patterns. These narrow isolation trenches would not only save available chip space but would also alleviate trench refill, improving planarization and facilitating polyimide back etch. Thus, it is an object of the invention to provide an improved optical photolithographic semiconductor process which is capable of producing resist lines in the micron and sub micron range without the use of specialized projection tools, and fragile masking elements. It is a further object of the invention to provide an improved optical photolithographic process which can be used to produce narrow trench isolation regions. These and other objects of the invention are achieved by a method according to claims 1, 4 and 6. The method of the invention comprises a multiple step optical photolithographic process which provides photoresist line patterns having widths in the micron and sub micron range. A semiconductor substrate is covered with a positive photoresist. The photoresist contains an additive for image reversal. A mask having a plurality of large opaque areas separated by large transparent areas is provided to the photoresist. When the photoresist is subsequently exposed through the mask, the edges of the opaque areas produce light diffraction patterns in the photoresist. Thus, the photoresist beneath the edges of the opaque areas is only partially exposed. The photoresist is developed in a solvent in order to remove portions of the photoresist corresponding substantially to the exposed regions of the photoresist. The remaining photoresist is then baked at about 100 C for 30 minutes, causing a hardening reaction in the partially exposed regions of the photoresist. This reaction is triggered by the decomposition products produced during partial exposure. The major portion of the remaining photoresist i.e., the unexposed regions do not react during this baking step because they do not contain these decomposition products. The hardening reaction freezes the solubility of the partially exposed areas with respect to the solubility of the unexposed areas. The photoresist is then blanket exposed, increasing the solubility of the unexposed regions of the photoresist. Thus, upon subsequent treatment of the photoresist with a second developer, only those portions of the photoresist corresponding substantially to the unexposed regions of the photoresist are dissolved. The remaining photoresist is that portion which was only partially exposed by the mask edge diffraction effects and hardened by the post development bake step. Thus, by use of the optical photolithographic process of the invention, resist lines in the order of 0.5 to 2.0 microns in width can be formed without the use of a fragile masking element. Moreover, these resist lines can be reversed to produce narrow trench isolation regions. The foregoing and other features of the invention will become more apparent upon a detailed description of the best mode of carrying out the invention. In the description to follow, reference will be made to the accompanying drawing, in which As shown in Fig. 1A, a semiconductor substrate 10 is covered with a positive photoresist layer 20. The positive photoresist used e.g., a diazoquinone photosensitive polymer such as AZ 1350J, commercially available through Shipley Co. contains an additive e.g., 1 imidazole which produces image reversal. A photomask 30 is positioned above photoresist layer 20. Note that the photomask 30 and photoresist layer 20 could also abut one another. The photomask 30 includes transparent segments 32 and opaque segments 34. Photomask 30 is constructed such that the edges of the opaque portions 34 define the desired resist lines. As shown in Fig. 1B, when the photoresist is imagewise exposed to light e.g., ultraviolet light from a light source through photomask 30, the light will produce a diffraction pattern defined by the pattern edges of the opaque segments 34 or the intersection of the clear and opaque segments of photomask 30. The portions of the photoresist which are exposed to the diffracted light are thus only partially exposed. That is, since the intensity of incident light decreases with increasing diffraction, the photoactive compounds within those portions of the photoresist receiving the diffracted light will only partially react. Thus, imagewise exposure through photomask 34 produces exposed areas 22, unexposed areas 26, and partially exposed areas 24 in the underlying photoresist layer 20. After light irradiation, photomask 30 is removed and photoresist layer 20 is developed in a dilute solvent. The composition of the solvent as well as other system parameters such as develop time, solvent temperature, photoresist composition and the optical parameters of the light is set such that all of the areas of the photoresist layer which were exposed to more than approximately 50 of the maximum light beam intensity are dissolved away. Thus, as shown in Fig. 1C, the exposed areas 26 of photoresist layer 20 are removed. Further, portions of the partially exposed areas 24 i.e., those portions which were exposed to more than approximately 50 of the maximum intensity of the light beam are also removed by the solvent. However, since the intensity of the light beam falls rapidly as a function of angular diffraction, the portion of the photoresist layer 20 removed by the solvent corresponds substantially to exposed areas 26. This is shown by the dashed lines of Fig. 1C. Both the shape and the amount of partially exposed area removed as well as the original shape of the partially exposed areas can be controlled by varying the above mentioned system parameters. The remaining portions of the partially exposed areas 24 as well as the unexposed areas 22 of photoresist 20 are then treated for image reversal. The photoresist 20 is first baked for approximately 30 minutes at approximately 100 C. During baking, a reaction occurs in the partially exposed areas 24 which hardens them with respect to unexposed areas 24. By hardening the partially exposed areas 24, this bake step freezes or slightly decreases the solubility of these areas, such that during a subsequent exposure step their solubility will not increase as will the solubility of the unhardened unexposed areas 22 . The reaction is triggered by the decomposition products carboxylate salts of the photoactive compounds which reacted during partial exposure. The unexposed areas 22 do not have these photoactive compound decomposition products, and thus do not undergo this hardening reaction. The mechanism of this reaction is a decarboxylation process, which is described in the above mentioned March 1982 Hamel After baking, photoresist layer 20 is blanket exposed. Since the exposed areas 22 did not undergo the hardening reaction, their solubility will be greater than that of the partially exposed areas 24. Thus, the treating of the photoresist by baking and blanket exposing produces different solubility characteristics. When the assembly is subsequently developed in a solvent, unexposed areas 22 will be dissolved, leaving partially exposed areas 24 on the surface of semiconductor substrate 10. As described above, the optical photolithography process of the invention utilizes a standard photomask to produce resist lines in the micron and sub micron range. Specifically, the manufacturing process of the invention has been used in conjunction with AZ 1350J photoresist having a 1 imidazole additive to produce resist lines ranging from 0.55 to 1.2 microns in width. A specific application of this technique would be to provide trench isolation patterns which are formed by using a dielectric lift off process to provide a photoresist to etch mask reversal in order to convert the narrow lines into narrow trenches. For example, a quartz film of 8 to 10 nm in thickness is sputtered onto the surface of the semiconductor substrate, covering the resist lines. The resist lines are then removed by lift off processing in a heated developer such as J 100, commercially available through the Shipley Co. The remaining thin quartz defines narrow trenches into which an oxide can be grown or sputtered to form narrow isolation regions. Thus, the narrow resist lines produced via the process of the invention could be used as a mask for any subsequent manufacturing process in which features having widths in the micron or sub micron range are to be produced. By use of the manufacturing method of the invention, the profile of the resist lines can be easily manipulated by setting the optical parameters of the light e.g., F stop, focus, partial coherence and spectral distribution . Other ways in which the profile of the resist lines may be controlled are changing the composition of the photoresist and controlling its develop time. These parametric controls provide flexibility to the optical photolithographic process of the invention. This flexibility is needed, for example, when adjacent resist lines are to be joined to form continuous isolation structures.
