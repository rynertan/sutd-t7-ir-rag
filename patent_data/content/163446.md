# Apparatus for and method of controlling magnetron sputter device having separate confining magnetic fields to separate targets subject to separate discharges.

## Abstract
A cathode sputter magnetron device is controlled so that there is a uniformity of material supplied to workpieces over the lives of plural geometrically spaced targets from which material is sputtered. Each target is subjected to a separate plasma discharge that is confined to the associated target by a separate magnetic field. The relative powers of the separate plasma discharges are controlled so that the relative powers change as a function of target erosion condition. The impedances of the separate discharges are controlled by varying each separate magnetic field in response to variable currents applied to electromagnets.
