## Claims
1. The process for obtaining the preparation used in the treatment of a skin disease psoriasis, characterized in that to a mixture of the components usually used for the preparation of, so called, greasy vehicle, a solution of the active ingredients being 9 fluoro 11 17,21 trihydroxy 16 methyl pregna 1,4 diene 3,20 dion 17,21 dipropionate and or 6,9 difluoro 11,16,17,21 tetrahydroxy pregna 1,4 diene 3,20 21 acetate 16,17 acetonide is added.

## Description
The invention refers to the obtaining of the preparation for the treatment of the skin disease Psoriasis manufactured in the form of medicinal ointment. The aim of the invention is to obtain a medicinal agent based on corticosteroids, salicylates and antibiotics, using catalysts belonging to the group of highly purified proteins, which would clear the skin from psoriasis effectively, the most quickly and without endangering the integrity of healthy organs and skin regions and the relapses approximate to zero point. It is well known that skin diseases are as old as human race and that people have been trying to find curative agents for them ever since. Therefore, plant extracts as well as drugs of both organic and nonorganic origin have been used. Nowadays, there are about 2000 preparations used all over the world in the treatment of psoriasis most of which are based on corticosteroids, combinations of corticosteroids or combinations of antibiotics and salicylates. The outstanding manufacturers of those preparations are Ciba Geigy, Syntex, Diosynth, Schering, Upjohn etc. The main disadvantages of the mentioned preparations are secondary effects after the local application of corticosteroids, such as skin necrosis, steroidal dermatitis and, in some cases, secondary effects on the adrenal gland e.g. suppression . The above disadvantages, namely, the activity of steroids on endocrine system are overcome by the preparation according to the invention. This preparation desintegrates all kinds of crusts avoiding skin necrosis and, by neutralization of sugilation and subfusion processes, it induces vasconstrictive effects on peripheral blood circulation and, therefore, enhances recovery. The adequate use of the drug, that is, the adequate combination of drug application and a certain hygienic dietetic treatment as well as the maintenance of a certain state of mind psychic peace presuppose very rare relapses into illness. The procedure for obtaining the drug according to the invention consists of the emulsion preparation consisting of oil phase, previously sterilized, and water, to which the active ingredients are added while constantly stirring and cooling, if necessary, so that all the phases are completed according to the order principle of ingredient stability to specified temperatures and after the addition of other components the homogenization and cooling processes are performed in order to obtain the ointment according to further aspects as disclosed in the claims. The invention will be, in the procedure of the text, described through an example without the intention to be limited to it. The weighed components, usually used in the preparation of the, so called, greasy vehicle, are melted, while premantently homogenized, at 150 C and, while stirring, cooled to 85 C 90 C so that the total preparation phase lasts for 20 minutes. The filtered and melted phase is added, while constantly stirring, into demineralized water, previously sterilized for 10 minutes, after which the resulting emulsion is sterilized for 30 minutes at 85 C 90 C. The emulsion is then cooled to 60 C and the previously prepared solutions of the active ingredients are added while stirring. The solutions of the active ingredients are added in this order 9 fluoro 11 17,21 trihydroxy 16 methyl pregna 1,4 diene 3,20 dion 17,21 dipropionate 6,9 difluoro 11,16,17,21 tetrahydroxy pregna 1,4 diene 3,20 21 acetate 16,17 acetonide, the ratio of the two corticosteroids being 1 1, after which, constantly stirring, are added gentamycin sulphate in the amount equivalent to at least 35000 IU 100 g of the ointment, vitamin A palmitate in the amount equivalent to 30000 IU 100 g of the ointment and, finally, 0.5 g of 2,4 dihydroxy N 3 hydroxy propyl 3,3 dimethylbutyramide. After stirring and homogenization, salicylic acid is added in the amount representing 7 of 100 g of the ointment and the emulsion is then again subjected to homogenization and cooling. During the manufacture of this preparation enough homogenizer should be provided for the component and vehicle preparation as well as for sterilization, vacuuming, micronization, that is for obtaining maximally homogenized mixture. The corticosteroids used as the active ingredients should be dissolved in suitable solvents, by an aseptic procedure, at the temperature providing the stability of the dissolved substances. The preparation, adequately applied and with addition of vitamins and with certain diet treatment, proved to be very effective not only in psoriasis cure but in significant decrease of the number of relapses as well.
