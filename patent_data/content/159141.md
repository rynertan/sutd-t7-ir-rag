# A CHANGE SPEED TRANSMISSION

## Abstract
A transmission comprises gear trains which provide increasing speed ratios and two clutches 12, 13 which are operable independently to provide alternative paths through the gear trains between an input 11, 20 and an output 14. The gear trains provide alternate ratios driven respec tively through one and the other clutch. The input comprises a first shaft 11 drivable by one clutch 12 and a second shaft 20 drivable by the other clutch 13. A layshaft 17 is provided through which drive in a selected ratio is transmitted from one 11 of the first and second shafts to the other 20 to drive the output which is also a shaft 14. One 20 of the first and second shafts has a gear 30 thereon which meshes with a gear 33 on the output shaft 14.
