## Description
Sprint Ac ti tor for Disc Baizes Th.is invention relates to an actuator device and relates in particular to an actuate capable of operation by one of two control signal pressures especially for brakes. It has already been proposed to provide in combination a pneumatic service brake actuator together with a springbrake actuator for parking or secondary braking. In certain applications, for example in the case of disc brake operation as wear takes place in the brake, the operating stroke becomes longer and the output force from the spring brake is reduced. One object of the invention is to minimise the stroke of the spring operated portion to minimise such reduction of force. According to the present invention there is provided an actuator device including a housing and a force output member, a relatively long stroke first pressure responsive member operable in response to a fluid pressure signal at a first signal input port to execute a forward stroke and to apply an output force via the force output member, locking means operable in relation to the force output member for locking thereof against more than a predetermined return stroke and a further relatively short stroke second pressure responsive member responsive to a control pressure at a second port and acting between the said output member and the brake to apply the brake. In a more particular appliea vJon of the present invention to a brake actuafor, the second pressure resp nsive mcmbcr is acted upon by spring means to apply a brake upon a reduction of the pressure at the second control port froni a full hold off pressure to a lower pressure. Preferably, the first pressure responsive member is operable to apply the brake via a tubular force output member and a further member is provided slideable within the tubular output member and coupled to the second pressure responsive member to act as aforesaid between the said output member and the brake. The first pressure responsive member may be arranged to contain the second pressure responsive member or alternatively the first and second pressure responsive members may be moveable one relative to the other within a common cylinder. In order that the invention may be more clearly understood and readily carried into effect, the same will be further described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings of which Figs. 1, 2 and 3 illustrate schematic sectional or half sectional views of alternative forms of brake actuator device in accordance with the invention and, Figs. 4, 5 and 6 illustrate a ratchet mechanism for use in the fcrrns of actuator of Figs. 1 to 3. Referring io Fig. 1, this shows a cylindrical housing i provided at one end with a first control pressure input port 2 and being enclosed at the other end by an ed plate 3.The end plate includes a ratchet mechanism denoted generally by the reference 4 operable in conjunction with ratchet teeth 5 provided on a tubu ar force output member 6. Tne cylindrical housing has a first pressure responsive member formed by a piston 7 and associated parts sealingly slideable in the cyl indrical bore with a piston seal 8. The piston 7 has a screw threaded skirt 9 threaded into a further skirt 1C of a cylindrical part 11 which itself is integral with the output member 6 and carries a further seal 2C sealingly slideable in the cylinder.The part 10 is itself internally cylindrical and slideable therein there is a second pressure responsive member in the form of a piston 12 having a piston rod 13 extending outwardly of the device through the force output member 6 acting on a pad member 14. Between the piston 12 and the piston 7 there are located spring means in the form of Belleville washers or the like denoted by reference 15 and inlarrangement illustrated, these are shown in the compressed condition owing to hold off pressure being provided in the chamber 16 between the members 11 and 12. This pressure is derivable from a second input port communicating via a channel 18 through a number of passages such as 19, seals being provided at 20, 21 and 22. It will be seen that the first pressure responsive member 7 is a relatively long stroke pressure responsive member operable to produce a direct output force via the force output member 6 acting on the pad member 14 for applying a brakeThe pressure responsive member 12 however is relatively short stroke pressure responsive member acting between the force output member 6 and the pad 14 to apply the brake. In normal running operation of the arrangement in inFig. 1, the chamber 16 is assumed to be fully pressuri ed with sufficient air pressure to hold the spring means 15 in the ccmpressed condition and if in addition a control pressure is applied at the first control port 2, the first pressure responsive piston 7 is urged in a direction to drive the force output member 6 outwardly of the housing 1. If the clearance on the brake pads or shoes is such that the forward stroke is greater than the distance between the flank of one ratchet tooth 5 and the flank of the next tooth, plus any necessary override or backlash, the ratchet means 4 will pass over at least one such tooth before the full brake force is applied.Upon subsequent release of air from the port 2, the force output member is permitted to return only by a maximum distance corresponding to the distance between the flank of one ratchet tooth and the flank of the next ratchet tooth plus any necessary override and subsequent backlash. In the event of a secondary or parking brake requirement occurring the application of the spring brake can be effected by release of fluid pressure from the chamber 16 via the second control pressure port. The second pressure responsive piston 12 is thereby moved forward by spring means 15 together with the pressure responsive member 7. Since the output member 6 has been locked into a position corresponding to no more than a predetermined return stroke, the second pressure responsive member 12 requires only to move a short distance corresponding to the said return stroke In order to apply the brake by acting between the force output member and the brake itself. In order to release the spring brake, hold off pressure is reapplied via the second signal pressure cro port to the chamber 16 and the piston 12 returns to the illustrated position with the spring means 15 fully conpressed. By virture of the invention, whilst it may be desirable to provide a sufficiently long stroke for the service brake actuator to be able to accomodate wear of the brake pads or shoes, by providing the locking means and arranging a second pressure responsive means which acts between the output member and the brake a spring brake portion may be employed which is of only relatively short stroke and a compact and convenient arrangement can be achieved. Referring to Fig. 2, this shows an arrangement which is in many ways similar to the arrangement of Fig. 1 to the extent that it equally provides a convenient arrangement with a relatively long stroke service brake actuator and a relatively short stroke spring or secondary brake actuator contained therein.The cylinder housing 1 and the end plate 3 together with ratchet means 4 may be substantially identical with the arrangement of Fig. le it is seen however that the first pressure responsive member now . has a portion 31 with piston seal 9 and which is provided with a tubular piston rod 32 the outward end of which is screwed at 33 into the force output member 34 which again is provided with ratchet teeth 35. Member 34 also has an so. integrally moveable wall 117 with a seal . Sealingly slideable on the tubular piston rod 32 of the first pressure resposiv member is a second pressure responsive member in the form of a piston 36 which is sealingly slideable also in the same bore 37 of the cylindrical housing. The second pressure responsive member 36 is provided with a piston rod 38 which is lid able wi thin the tubular piston rod 32 and is dowelled to the piston 36 by a dbwul 39 extending through a short slot 40 in the tubular member 34 as shown.Furthermore, spring means in the form of Belleville w shrrS 41 or the like is provided between the pistons 31 and 36 and in the position shown, these are shown under compression by virtue of the presence of controlling fluid pressure applied via a second port 116 to the chamber 42 acting on the pressure responsive member 36, further seals being provided at 113, 44 and 45 as shown. The operation of the arrangement in Fig. 2 is substantially the same as that of the arrangement in Fig. 1.That is, assuming that full hold off pressure exists in the chamber 112, the piston 36 is then in the condition shown holding the spring means 41 under compression and a service pressure applied at the first input port 2 urges the pressure responsive member 31 leftwards to apply the brake via the tubular member 32 and the force output member 34. If the stroke exceeds the distance between flanks of two adjacent ratchet teeth 35, the ratchet mechanism 4 rides over at least one such tooth and on the return stroke, the return movement is limited to no more than the distance between the flanks of two adjacent ratchet teeth plus any other lost motion.In order to apply the secondary or spring brake, the pressure in the chamber 42 is reduced via the second control pressure port with the effect that the spring means 41 act between the first pressure responsive member 31 through the piston 36, the dowel 39, the inner piston rod 48 and the brake.Subsequent recovery of full pressure in the chamber 42 causes return movement of piston 36 to again release the brake RefcrrinX to Fig. 3 wherein by way of contraU M 7 3 4 resilient ean are hwn in the fully extended condition with the inncr piston rbd exteirdcd, the arrangement is substantially the same as Fig. 2 from the point of view of operation but in this case, the first piston 31 has a tubular piston rod 321 screwed and dowelled onto a spigot of the piston.This may be an advantageous construction depending upon the metallic materials employed for the construction of the device. Referring now to the pawl and ratchet mechanism employed.in end plate 3 of the actuator devices of Fig. 1, Fig. 2 orFig. 3, this is shown in more detail in Figs. 4 and 5. As in other applications of pawl and ratchet mechanisms, where the mechanism is required to withstand appreciable forces, special strength considerations exist. The ratchet mechanism 4 and teeth 5 of Fig. 1 or Fig. 2 are seen to be required to sup port the full force exerted by the spring brake portion of the actuator. One flank of each ratchet tooth 5 is substantially perpendicular to the axis and engaging with the pawl 4 which is spring loaded by a spring 68 and a ball 67 and also pivoted as discussed below so that it rotates clockwise and lifts when the push rod moves to engage the oblique flank of the next tooth with the pawl but is restrained against rotation when the push rod moves in the opposite direction to engage a perpendicular flank. This allows unlimited movement of the member 6 in one direction and strictly limited movement in the other. The pawl is arranged to provide a substantial backlash in its operation. The pawl is pivoted as shown in Fig. 5 en to co axial cylindrical extensions 56 and 57 which are borne in bearirgs 58, 59 and 60. These are radially located in bores 61 and 62 by resilient mounting rings 76. These are shown as O rings but could be rings of any cross section and of any resiliently deformable material. The back face 63 of the pawl forms part of a cylinder co axial with cylindrical extensions 56 and 57. The diameters of the cylindrical extensions of pawl 11, bearings 58, 59 and 60 and of bores 61 and 62 are arranged such that the clearance 64 is small in comparison with the clearances 65 and 66 which are shown exaggerated for clarity. Thus under the light loads induced by movement of the oblique tooth faces 5 in Fig. 5 against the pawl II, resisted only by a ball 67 under the influence of a light spring 68 the pawl pivots 56 and 57 remain concentric with the bores 61 and 62, and the pawl is free to rotate within bore 62. However, on the return stroke when a perpendicular face engages with the pawl 4 and is required to transmit or react a substantial load, only a portion of this load is taken through the bearings as the resilient rings distort until the surface 63 is engaged with the surface of bore 62 and any further load will be taken directly in the cover 69 and consequently the cylindrical body 1. The pawl may be released from the rate to permit J V Swµ S the push rod to be redacted, by striking a cylindrical extension 56 on the end 71, thui moving pawl 4 and bearing 59 axially against spring 72 until bearing 59 butts against bearing 60 at which point the pawl 4 will be clear of ratchet teeth. This axial movement may be effected by other means, e.g., a cam operated manually or otherwise or a screw actuator or a fluid operated actuator, The reaction force on the member 6 causes moveet of that item in the release direction until the force applied through that pugh rod is released. The pawl may be held out of engagement with the ratchet teeth either manually or by other means until the required retraction is effected. On release of the pawl it is urged axially under the influence of spring 22 against the ratchet and at such time as it aligns with a space between the teeth will re engage therewith. In refinement of this arrangement the rear face 73 of pawl 4 may be chamfered toward the engaging face 74 and the oblique face of each tooth to be chamfered toward the engaging end 75 so that a lead in is provided and engagement is effected whatever the relative positions of the two parts albeit that in some cases the pawl returns to the rotated and raised position. A further refinersent applicable to a fluid pressure operable service and spring applied parking disc brake cctuator is for the spring 72 to be of insufficient strength to reengage the pawl, but merely of sufficient strength to enable bearing 59 to follow the pawl as it is pushed into engagement.A fluid pressure cylinder may be used to move the pawl into engagcment with the ratchet, the fluid being in connection with and at the same pressure as that compressing the brake application spring. This resists any attempt to disengage the pawl unless pressure was released from the spring cC.mpress ion chamber either deliberately or due to leakage. One embodiment of such an arrangement is shown diagrammatically in section in Fig. 6 wherein the cylindrical extension 57 of pawl 4 in Fig. 5 is shortened to that shown as 131, and runs in bearing 132 in place of 59 and 60 located in a piston 133 by a resilient ring 34. Piston chamber 135 is at the same pressure as, and in communication with the spring compression chamber 16 or 42 , via passages 137 and 139 formed in the housing. These chambers are thus supplied with fluid pressure conveying fluid from the spring brake system at a pressure determined by a spring brake control valve.A screwed plug 141 provides the end of the cylinder 135 and acts as a stop for piston 133 and carries a seal 142 against loss of fluid or fluid pressure. Access to piston 133 and seal 143 for inspection and maintenance is effected by removal of plug 1141. In operation, as applied to Fig. 2, upon release of pressure from the spring compression chamber trfez ner actuator push rod is advanced under the influence of thc spring 41, acting through piston pin 39, and reacting on piston assembly held in place by pawl 4 engaging with the ratchet teetn 35. Should fluid pressure be permanetly lost due to leakage or cut off during service or maintenance the Lake may be released by striking end 121 as described previously disengaging pawl 4 from the ratchet teeth 35 and the outer push rod 34. This action moves piston 133 to the opposite end of cylinder 135.Thereafter re engagement of the pawl is effected only by the restoration of fluid pressure to the spring compression chamber 112, and consequently to cylinder 135, thereby acting on piston 133 to move pawl 4 into re engagement with the ratchet.Operation of the service brake after disengagement of the pawl will not result in the pawl preventing retraction of the push rod, as would be the case where the pawl re engagement was effected by means of a spring.
