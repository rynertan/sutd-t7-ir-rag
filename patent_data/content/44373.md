# Growth of single crystal magnetoplumbite.

## Abstract
Single crystal magnetoplumbite is grown at tempera tures under 1000 C from a fluxed melt having a selected concentration ratio of boron oxide to lead oxide and a selected concentration of iron oxide sufficient to cause magnetoplumbite to crystallize yet not so much iron oxide as will cause the melt s crystallization temperature to exceed 1000 C.
