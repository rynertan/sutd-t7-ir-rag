# COAL WATER FUEL PRODUCTION

## Abstract
A process and apparatus for producing coal water fuel comprises crushing and primary grinding of the coal to form a liberated granular material, multiple stage froth flotation of the granulated coal to reduce its ash content and pyritic sulphur content. The resulting product from the froth flotation opera tions is dewatered to yield a product having a selected solids content. A stable slurry is then produced from the product by establishing a selected particle size distribution. Refuse ac cumulated from the various previous steps is collected, dewa tered and the water is clarified for use in the process steps.
