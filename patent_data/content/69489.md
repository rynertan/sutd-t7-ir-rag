# Overhead electric transmission systems.

## Abstract
In an inexpensive and simple method of effecting a joint between two overhead electric conductors 1 incorporating optical fibres 3, or between an overhead electric conductor incorporating an optical fibre and an optical cable extending to a sub station or other location, at least a part of each of the overhead conductor is introduced into a metal sleeve 12 extending from a wall of a metal housing 10 and the sleeve is compression jointed to the conductor to effect a mechanical and electrical joint between the conductor and the housing. The part 2 of the conductor protruding into the housing is cut back and a joint 4 is effected between the optical fibres 3 of the two overhead conductors 1, or between the optical fibres of the overhead conductor and the optical cable that has been introduced into the housing. The housing 10 is sealed to render it fluid tight and is preferably filled with petroleum jelly 20. An elongage metal shroud not shown may be assembled around the metal housing and be so shaped as to provide aerodynamic and corona protection.
