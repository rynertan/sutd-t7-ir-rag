# Forming necks on hollow bodies.

## Abstract
A thin walled hollow body open at one end, e.g. a metal can body 76 , is given a terminal neck 74 by engaging a primary chuck nose 22 sealingly in the open end and pressurising the body internally to pre stress it and hold it against a lift pad 16 the latter is lowered so that the sidewall end portion 80 is progressively rolled by forming rolls 46 to form the neck partly in free space 38 and partly against a secondary chuck nose 30 which maintains the pressure seal when the seal between the sidewall and the primary chuck nose is broken. In a modification, the rolls 46 may be withdrawn early, so as to leave a terminal flange on the can body.
