# Internal downcomer for electrolytic recirculation.

## Abstract
In a filter press membrane electrolytic cell having a plurality of electrodes 11, 12 , each electrode 11, 12 being of predetermined thickness and separated from the adjacent electrode 11, 12 by an ion selective permeable membrane 22 all supported by a frame and in fluid flow communica tion with a gas liquid disengager 28, 29 there is provided an improved electrolyte return line 24, 26 having a first portion external to each electrode 11, 12 and a second portion internal to each electrode 11, 12 , wherein the second portion fits within the predetermined thickness in a structu rally reinforcing manner so that the structural rigidity of the electrode 11, 12 is increased while the electrode surface area available for fluid contact is maximized.
