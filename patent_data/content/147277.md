# PROCESS FOR SEPARATING A FEED STREAM GAS MIXTURE USING PRESSURE SWING ADSORPTION

## Abstract
A molecular sieve, pressure swing adsorption process employing two adsorbers for generating an enriched gas from a feed stream gas mixture is claimed, wherein each adsorber repeatedly passes through sequential steps com prising a high pressure adsorption b cocurrent partial depressurization by pressure equali zation c countercurrent venting to atmosphere d regeneration using a product gas purge e partial repressurization using product gas f cocurrent partial repressurization by pressure equali zation and g feed gas repressurization to the adsorption pressure.
