# Parallelepipedic packing container.

## Abstract
A parallelepipedic packing container is manufactured by the transverse sealing of a packing material tube filled with contents. On sealing and subsequent forming of the package, on one hand, sealing fins 11,12 extending over the end walls 4 of the packing container, on the other hand triangular corner lugs 3 located on the short sides of the end walls 4, 5 are obtained. The sealing fins 11, 12 as well as the corner lugs 3 are folded down during the forming so as to lie against adjoining container walls 4, 5 . The folding up of the fin 11 as well as the subsequent tearing up are facilitated in accordance with the invention in that one of the fins 11 is given a greater width at the end where the tearing indication 10 is situated. At the same time the opposite end of the fin is made narrower so as to facilitate the folding down of the triangular corner lug 3 located underneath the fin end.
