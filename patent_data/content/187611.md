# FLEXIBLE LINK DISK DRIVE FOR MULTIPLE DISK REFINER

## Abstract
A multiple disk refiner 10 which includes a housing 11 having an inlet 12 and an outlet 13 for a fiber suspension passing therethrough. Within the housing 11 there is a plurality of rotary refiner disks 20 to 25 positioned for rotation in the housing 11 and having refiner surfaces for providing a refining action on the fiber suspension as it passes from the inlet 12 to the outlet 13 . A second plurality of refiner disks 28, 31, 33, 35, 36, 39 interleaved with the rotary refiner disks 20 to 25 and having refiner surfaces confronting the refiner surfaces of the rotary refiner disks 20 to 25 are positioned to provide narrow working gaps 30,32, 34, 37, 38, 40 between the sets of disks. In accordance with the present invention, a plurality of flexible links 51, 58 interconnect a drive with the rotary refiner disks 20 to 25 to provide rotational drive to the disks while accomodating axial deflection between the rotary refiner disks 20 to 25 and the drive.
