# Altitude hold system with automatic ground effect compensation for vertical take off and landing aircraft.

## Abstract
During a transition of a VTOL aircraft such as a helicopter, from one altitude held without its ground effect zone to another to be held within it ground effect zone, or vice versa, a collective stick position synchroniser A2 which can memor ise the proper trim condition at the previous altitude in con junction with the stick force sensor 16 out of detent logic and a low vertical speed sensor, together constituting a ground effect zone detector, is used to drive the collective stick trim actuator 12 in a direction which relieves any force being exerted by the pilot in order to maintain the new com manded altitude.
