# Process for preparing base salts of piroxicam deposited on a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

## Abstract
A process has been developed for preparing the sodium, the monoethanolamine and the diethanolamine salts of pirox icam, in which the salt is deposited on a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The compositions so obtained are useful for preparing pharmaceutical dosage forms of piroxicam, from which piroxicam is rapidly absorbed from the gastroin testinal tract after oral administration to mammals. These latter dosage forms are particularly suitable when it is desired to use piroxicam as an analgesic agent, where rapid onset of action is necessary.

## Description
BASE SALTS OF PIROXICAM DEPOSITED ON A PHARMACEUTICAILY ACCEPTABLE CARRIER Piroxicam, which is identified chemically as 4 hydroxy 2 methyl N 2 pyridyl 2H 1,2 benzothiazine3 carboxyamide, is a non steroidal anti inflammetory agent which is finding increasing clinical use in the treatment of cheumatoid arthritis in man. For this purpose it is usually administered orally, in the form of capsules containing the anhydrous compound which has a low solubility in water and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.However, piroxicam also has analgesic properties, and for this indication it is prefer able to administer piroxicam as a water soluble salt, to facilitate rapid bioloical absorption Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide a process for preparing cartain water soluble, base salts of piroxicam.More particularly, this inven tion provides a process for preparing cartain watersoluble, base salts of piroxicam, in which the salt has been deposited on Ã…a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The compositions so obtained can be incopo rated into dosage forms which have a rapid rate o disintegration, a rapid rate of dissolution and a rapid rate of absorption after oral administration to 2 mammalian subject. Utilization of the process of this invention ofers advantages over conventional methods of preparing dosage forns of a salt of pirosicam in that it avoids the necessity for isolating, purifying and characterizing the particular salt, and also the mechanical losses and costs attendant upon isolating z particular salt. Conventional methods for preparing salts Of piroxicam are taught in United States patent No.3,591,584 and published European patent applicationNo. 66459 1982 . This invention provides a process for preparing a base salt of piroxicam deposited on a pharmeceutically acceptable carrier, said base salt of piroxicam being selected from the group consisting of the sodium salt, the ethanolamine salt and the diethanolamine salt, which comprises a combining piroxicam, a basic reagent selected from sodium hydroxide, trisodium phosphate, ethanolamine and diethanolamine and ap harmaceutically acceptable carrier, in a solvent selected from water, alkanols having one to four carbons and mixtures thereof, at a temperature in the range from 10 to 400 C. wherein the piroxicam and the basic reagent are contacted in substantially equimolar proportions, the ratio of the carrier to the piroxicam is in the range from 5 1 to 30 1 by weight and the ratio of the solvent to the carrier is in the range from 1 1 to 1 5 by weight with the proviso that when said basic reagent is trisodium phosphate, said solvent must be at least 90 water by weight . b granulating the product or step a and c removing the solvent from the product of step b . Typical pharmaceutically acceptable carriers which can be used are microcrystalline cellulose and lactose1 optionally in admixture with sodium citrate. In carrying out the process of this invention, the preferred ratio of the carrier to the piroxicam is in the range from 10 1 to 25 1, and the preferred ratio oz the solvent to the carrier is in the range from 1 1.2 to 1 3. This invention relates to a process for preparing salts of pisoxicam, which is the compound of the formulaEMI3.1 and when reference is made. to piroxicam in step Ca of the process of this invention, said reference is intended to refer both to anhydrons pirexican and also the various non toxic solvates thereof. Step Ca of the process of this invention involves combining piroxicam, a base, a carrier and z solvent and the manner and order in which they are combined is not critical. For example, the piroxicam can be blended with the carrier, and then this blend can be added with stirring to a solution of the base in the solvent. Alternatively, a solution of the piroxicam salt can be prepared by adding both piroxicam and the base to the solvent, and then the piroxicam salt solution can be used to wet the carrier. In yet another variation, Which can be used especially when a liquid base is being used, the piroxicam and the carrier are fist blended together, then the liquid base is added, and finally the mixture so obtained is wetted will the solvent. The solvent which is used in stap a of the process of this invention is selected from water and alkanols having one to four carbon atoms, and mixtures thereof.However, when using mixtures, it is advantageous to use a homogeneous mixture. Moreover, when trisodium phosphate is used as the basic reagent, the solvent system for step a must be at least 90 water by weight. During the process of step a of this invention, verious conventional mixing, agitating and blending techniques are commonly used. In regard to the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier to be employed in step CaL of the process of this invention, a variety of such agents can be employed The major requirenents of the phazmaceuticaIly acceptable carrier are that it is a solid, it does not adversely interact with either piroxicam or the solvent used in step Ca of this process, and it is non toxic to the mammalian host which is to be treated ultimately.Typical carriers which are used are microcrystalline cellulose, lactose, calcium sulfate and dicalcium phosphate, and mixtures thereof. Particularly preferred is microcrystallina cellulose, especially he foo grade, microcrystalline, partially depolymerized cellulose obtained by treating plant cellulose with mineral acid as described in United States patent No. 2,978,446. If desired, certain buffers such as sodium citrate can fo part of the phammaceutically acceptable carrier.The buffer will normally be present in an amount, by weight, which is equal to or less than the other ingradients. Also, if desired, small amounts, e.g. 10 or less by weight of the total carrier used, of other ingredients such as dispersing agents e.g. starch and alginic acid , binding agents e.g. polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose, gelatin and acacia and lubricating agents e.g. talc, megnesium stearate and sodium lauryl sulfatel. In step a of the process of this invention, the piroxicam and the basic reagent are normally contacted in equimolar proportions. However, a slight excess e.g. 5 molar percent of either component can be used.Larger excesses of either compound are not desirable. As far as the proportion of piroxicam and the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier in step a are concerned, the ratio of the carrier to the piroxican is usually in the range from 5 1 to 30 1, and preferably 10 1 to 25 1, by weight. In like manner, the ratio of the solvent to the carrier is normally in the range from 1 1 to 1 5, and preferably 1 1.2 to 1 3, by weight. Step b of the process of this invention involves granulating the product of step Car. The term granu lating, as used herein, has the normal, conventional meaning commonly used m standard pharmaceutical practice.Essentially, it refers to a process in which the individual particles of the material produced in step a are accreted to form agglomerates. This process converts the small particles in the material produced in step a into larger particles, the agglomerates, which are denser, more spherical in shape and generally for uniform in size. The granulation is carried out in conventional fashion, and basically it involves blending or kneading the product of step a until the desired amount of accretion has taken place.In the product of step b , the particle size will normally be in t range from 125 to 400 micrometers. Step c of the process of this invention involves removal of the solvent that was added in step t2 . This is carried out in conventional fashidn. It can be carried out simply by exposing the product of step h to air, or an inert gas such as nitrogen or argon, at relative humidity of less than 50E, at a temperature in the range from 20 to 30 C., and a pressure in the range from 0.1 mm of mercury to. atmospheric pressure. However, the preferred drying temperature is about 500 C., and it is usually convenient to carry out the drying at about atmospheric pressure.Under these later conditions, drying times of a few hours, e.g. 2 to 20 hours are commonly used In any event, drying is stopped when the solvent concentration in the product has been reduced to about 0.1 or less The compositions produced by the process of this invention can be used directly as a medicinal agent.However, more usually, they are converted into tablets suitable for oral administration to a human subject.For the latter purpose, the compositions are usually combined with further amounts of a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, e.g. microcrystalline cellulose, lactose or dioalcilm phosphate.Various disintegrants such as starch, a.g. potato starch or tapioca starch, and binding agents e.g. polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose, gelatin or acacia, can be added. Also, lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate and or sodium lauryl sulfate, ara commonly added. After blending, the final composition is compressed into tablets in conventional fashion Tablets so produced will normally contain a piroxicam salt in an amount equivalent to from 5 to 30 mg of piroxicam free acid, and they will normally be administered orally to human subjects once a day for the control of rheumatoid aftb itis. However, 25 indi cated hereinbefore, these tablets are particularly suitable for analgesic use, on account of their rapid disintegration, dissolution and absorption after oral administration to a human subject. The following Examples are being provided solely for the purpose of further illustration. EXAMPLE 1 Sodium Salt of Piroxicam Deposited on Microcrystalline Cellulose To a blended mixture of 1Q.0 g of piroxicam and 100.0 g of Avicel ph 101 Ca microcrystalline cellulose was added, with stirring, z solution of 1.20 g of sodium hydroxide in 80 g of ethanol.
