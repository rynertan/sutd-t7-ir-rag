# Apparatus for grooving tyres.

## Abstract
An apparatus for grooving a tyre comprises a tyre support shaft 21 for rotatable supporting the tyre and a support frame 31 having a cutter device 5 mounted thereon. The cutter device 5 and the tyre support shaft 21 are movable relative to each other in a transverse direction parallel with the tyre support shaft 21 and perpendicular to the tyre support shaft 21 . The cutter 5 is supportable at a desired angle with the tread surface and the cutter blade 5 is rotatable in the direction of the groove to be formed. The cutting position of the cutter 5 is on the axis 39 of an arm support shaft 38 and is controllable by the combination of orthogonal coordinates to simplify the control program for the apparatus. When required, the cutter 5 is swingably attached to a cutter holder 41 to enable the cutter 5 to cut the tyre rubber and to be released therefrom with ease without the need to heat the cutter 5 . When the cutter 5 is provided with a heater, the cutter heating temperature and operation speed are so controlled that the temperature of rubber around the cutter 5 is maintained at a predeter mined constant level.
