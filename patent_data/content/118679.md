# Oxygen partial pressure controller for a pressure swing adsorption system.

## Abstract
An oxygen partial pressure controller regulates the oxygen partial pressure PPO₂ of the product gas of a pressure swing adsorption oxygen enriching system by means of a bleed valve 16 which increases gas flow through the adsorptive system thereby decreasing the PPO₂ of the product gas. The controller includes a solenoid valve 28 which permits the bleed valve to function when the adsorption system pressure and PPO₂ is high.
