# A flocculating agent and a process for its production.

## Abstract
A flocculating agent for use in water purification tech nology and papermaking technology is described, as well as a process of producing the flocculating agent which is the reaction product of sulphate ion containing polymeric alumi nium hydroxy chloride and one or more cationic polymers preferably selected among polyacrylic amide, polyamide amine and polyethylene imine. The most preferred cationic polymer is polyacrylic amide. The flocculating agent is produced by mixing an aqueous suspension of sulphate ion containing aluminium polyhydroxy chloride having a solids content of 20 30 parts by weight with 0.3 60 parts by weight of cationic polymer, based upon 100 parts by weight of sulphate ion containing aluminium polyhydroxy chloride, and by heat ing the mixture for 2 4 h at a temperature varying from about 80 C to the boiling of the mixture.
