# Paper sizing composition.

## Abstract
A paper sizing composition which is suitable for use in neutral to alkaline paper making processes and which dis perses well in water, comprising 20 to 90 by weight of A a reaction product and or its hydrogenation product, which reaction product is obtained by adding maleic anhydride to branched internal olefins having 14 to 36 carbon atoms which are obtained by oligomerizing one or a mixture of olefin start ing materials having 6 to 18 carbon atoms and 10 to 80 by weight of B another reaction product and or its hydrogena tion product, which reaction product is obtained by reacting maleic anhydride with straight chain internal olefins having 14 to 36 carbon atoms.
