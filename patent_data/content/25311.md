# Non volatile semiconductor memory device.

## Abstract
A non volatile semiconductor memory device comprises a substrate 1 a source region 3 and a drain region 4 a channel region 5 between the source and drain regions first and second insulating layers 6, 8 over the channel region and a floating gate 7 or traps 7 min between the first and second insulating layers. In the first insulating layer the gap of an energy band thereof increases from the region of the substrate to the region of the floating gate or the traps.
