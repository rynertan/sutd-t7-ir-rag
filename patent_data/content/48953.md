The term cation , as used throughout the specification, refers to any positively charged atom or group of atoms. The SO3M substituent on the nitrogen atom of the B lactams of this invention encompasses all sulfohic acid salts.Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are, of course, preferred, although other salts are alsb useful in purifying the products of this invention or as intermediates for the preparation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts. The cationic portion of the sulfonic acid salts of this invention can be obtained from either organic or inorganic bases. Such cation portion includes, but is not limited to, the following ions ammonium substituted ammonium, such as alkylammonium e.g., tetra n butylammonium, referred to hereinafter as tetrabutylammonium alkali metal, such as lithium, sodium and potassium alkaline earth metal, such as calcium and magnesium pyridinium dicyclohexylammonium hydrabaminium benzathinium N methyl D alucaminium. Some of the compounds of this invention may be crystallized or recrystallized from solvents containing water. In these cases water of hydration may be formed. This invention contemplates stoichiometric hydrates as well as compounds containing variable amounts of water that may be produced by processes such as lyophilization. ss Lactams having a sulfonic acid salt substituent in the l position and an amino or acylamino substituent in the 3 position contain at least one chiral center the carbon atom in the 3 position of the ss lactam nucleus to which the amino or acylamino substituent is attached. This invention is directed to those ss lactams which have been described above, wherein the stereochemistry at the chiral center in the 3 position of the B lactam nucleus is the same as the configuration at the carbon atom in the 6 position of naturally occurring penicillins e.g., penicillin G and as the configuration at the carbon atom in the 7 position of naturally occurring cephamycins e.g., cephamycin C . With respect to the preferred B lactams of formulas I and Ia, the structural formulas have been drawn to show the stereochemistry at the chiral center in the 3 position. Because of the nomenclature convention, those compounds of formulas I and Ia wherein R2 is hydrogen have the S configuration and those compounds of formulas I and Ia wherein R2 is alkoxy have the R configuration. Also included within the scope of this invention are racemic mixtures which contain the above described B lactams. The compounds of this invention have activity against a range of gram negative and gram positive organisms and can be used as agents to combat bacterial infections including urinary tract infections and respiratory infections in mammalian species, such as domesticated animals e.g., dogs, cats, cows, horses, and the like and humans. For combating bacterial infections in mammals a compound of this invention can be administered to a mammal in need thereof in an amount of about 1.4 mg kg day to about 350 mg kg day, perferably about 14 mg kg day to about 100 mg kg day. All modes of administration which have been used in the past to deliver penicillins and cephalosporins to the site of the infection are also contemplated for use with the novel family of ss lactams of this invention. Such methods of administration include oral, intravenous, intramuscular and as a suppository. The lactamproducts of this invention are generally prepared by the introduction of a sulfonic acid substituent a sulfo group SO3 onto the nitrogen atom in the l position of the ss lactam nucleus. This sulfonation reaction is readily effected by treating the ss lactam with a sulfur trioxide complex or within equivalent sulfonating reagent such as a chlorosulfonate. The sulfur trioxide complexes most commonly used are pyridine sulfur trioxide lutidine sulfur trioxide dimethylformamide sulfur trioxide and picoline sulfur trioxide. Instead of using a pre formed complex, the complex can be formed in situ, e.g., using chlorosulfonyl trimethylsilyl ester and pyridine as reagents.Alternatively, sulfonation can be effected by way of an intermediate compound as for example first silylating the nitrogen atom of the ss lactam nucleus and then subjecting the silated compound to a silyl interchange reaction with trimethylsilylchlorosulfonate or a similar reagent. Exemplary silylating agents are monosilyltrifluoroacetamide, trimethylsilylchloride triethylamine and bis trimethylsilyl trifluoroacetamide. Generally, the sulfonation reaction is carried out in the presence of an organic solvent such as pyridine or amixture of organic solvents, preferably a mixture of a polar solvent such as dimethylformamide and a halogenated hydrocarbon such as dichloromethane. The product initially formed in the sulfonation reaction is a salt of the sulfonated S lactam. When pyridine sulfur trioxide is the sulfonating complex the product initially formed is the B lactam sulfonated pyridiniumsalt of the sulfonated ss lactam wherein M in the formula below is the pyridinium ion EMI13.1 These complexes can be converted to other sulfonic acid salts using conventional techniques e.g., ionexchange resins, crystallization or ion pair extraction.These conversion techniques are also useful in purifying the products. Conversion of the pyridine salt to the potassium salt using potassium phosphate or potassium ethyl hexanoate to the tetrabutylammonium salt using tetrabutyl ammonium hydrogen sulfate or to a zwitterian M hydrogen using formic acid are particularly useful. It should be appreciated that the sulfonation reaction which introduces the sulfo group onto the nitrogen atom of the ss lactam nucleus can be effected at various stages of the synthesis, including insertion prior to the formation of a ss lactam nucleus, where such procedure is followed as outlined below.The sulfonation reaction is effected in the presence of solvents previously described and usually at room temperature, Where the amino function is present it is preferably conducted with the amino function protected. Using a benzyloxycarbonyl protecting group as an example, the sulfonation reaction can be visualized as follows EMI14.1 Other protecting groups can be used to protect the amine function, for example, a t butyloxycarbonyl group, a simple acyl group such as acetyl or benzopl of phenylacetyl, a triphenylmethyl group, or having the amino function in the form of an azide group. The desired acyl group R1 can then be affixed by a conventional acylation redaction. Exemplary acylation techniques for converting a compound of formula III to a product of formula I include reaction with a carboxylic acid R1 OH , or corresponding carboxylic acid halide or carboxylic acid anhydride. When R2 is alkoxy, acylcation is best effected by use of an acid chloride or acid bromide. The reaction with a carboxylic acid proceeds most readily in the presence of a carbodiimide such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and a substance capable of forming an active ester in situ such as N hydroxybenzotriazole. In those instances when the acyl group R1 contains reactive functionality such as amino or carboxyl groups it may be necessary to first protect.those functional groups, then carry out the acylation reaction, and finally deprotect the resulting product.Alternatively, the sulfonation reaction can be effected with the acyl group already in place, i.e.,EMI15.1 In the case where R2 is lower alkoxy, there can be an additional variation in that the R2 lower alkoxy group can be inserted after the sulfonation as well as before the sulfonation using the conventional procedure of chlorinating the acylated nitrogen atom in the 3position followed by reaction with a lower alkoxide EMI16.1 The acyl groups in the above reactionalsoincludeeasily removable groups which function as a protecting group and which can be removed after the reaction to afford the deacylated product NH2 . In addition, the ss lactam ring can be formed via a cyclization reaction and the sulfonation reaction can be effected prior to cyclization as well as subsequent thereto, i.e.,EMI16.2 The acyl group in this reaction can also be an easily removable group which functions as a protecting group and which on removal affords the NH2 product. The azetidinone starting materials wherein R2 is hydrogen and one of R3 and R4 is hydrogen can also be prepared from amino acids having the formulaEMI17.1 one of R3 and R4 is hydrogen . The amino group is first protected with a classical protecting group, e.g., t butoxycarbonyl referred to hereinafter as Boc . The carboxyl group of the protected amino acid is then reacted with an amine salt having the formula XIII Y O NH3C1 wherein Y is alkyl or benzyl, in the presence of a carbodiimide to yield a compound having the formulaEMI17.2 one of R3 and R4 is hydrogen . The hydroxyl group of a compound of formula XIV is converted to a leaving group V with a classical reagent, e.g., methanesulfonyl chloride methanesulfonyl is referred to hereinafter as Ms .Other leaving groups V which can be utilized are benzenesulfonyl, toluenesulfonyl, chloro, bromo and iodo. The fully protected compound having the formulaEMI18.1 one of R3 and R4 is hydrogen is cyclized by treatment with base, e.g., potassium carbonate.The reaction is preferably carried out in an organic solvent such as acetone, under reflux conditions, and yields a compound having the formulaEMI18.2 one of R3 and Rd is hydrogen . Alternatively, cyclization of a compound of formula XIV can be accomplished without first converting the hydroxyi group to a leaving group.Treatment of a compound of formula XIV with triphenylphosphine and diethylazodicarboxylate, yields a compound of formula XVI wherein one of R3 and R4 is hydrogen. Removal of the protecting group from the 1position of an azetidinone of formula XVI can be accomplished via sodium reduction when Y is alkyl, and yields an intermediate having the formulaEMI19.1 one of R3 and R4 is hydrogen . If Y is benzyl, catalytic e.g., palladium on charcoal hydrogenation will initially yield the correspondingN hydroxy compound, which upon treatment with titanium trichloride yields an intermediate of formula XVII wherein one of R3 and R is hydrogen. Synthesis involving ring closure of the type described above results in inversion of the stereochemical configuration of the R3 and R4 substituents. As previously mentioned, the above azetidinone can be sulfonated to form a compound havina the formulaEMI19.2 one of R3 and R4 is hydrogen . An alternative procedure for preparing a compound of formula I wherein R2 is hydrogen and one of R3 and R4 is hydrogen, utilizes as a starting material an amino acid amide having the formulaEMI19.3 ene of R3 and R4 is hydrogen . Protection of the amino group with a classical protecting group, e.g., benzyloxycarbonyl reffered to hereinafter as Z or Boc, and conversion of the hydroxyl group to a leaving group V such as Ms yields a compound having the formulaEMI20.1 one of R3 and P4 is hydrogen , wherein A is a protecting group. Sulfonation of a compound of formula XX yields a compound having the formulaEMI20.2 one of R3 and R4 is hydrogen . Cyclization of a compound of formula XXI is accomplished with base, e.g., potassium carbonate. The reaction is preferably carried out in a mixture of water and an organic solvent e.g., a halogenated hydrocarbon such as l,2 dichloroethane under reflux conditions and yields a compound having the formulaEMI20.3 one of R3 and R4 is hydrogen, Deprotection of a sulfonated azetidinone of formula XXII, wherein A is a protecting group, as well as the counterpart compounds previously described having an R2alkoxygroup by catalytic hydrogenation yields a compound having the formula EMI21.1 one of R3 and R4 is hydrogen , wherein R2 is hydrogen or alkoxy which can be converted to the corresponding zwitterion having the formulaEMI21.2 one of R3 and R4 is hydrogen by treatment with an acid such as formic acid. Deprotection of a sulfonated azetidinone of formula XXII wherein A is a Boc protecting group using acidic conditions e.g., using formic acid yields the corresponding zwitterion of formula XIX. A 3 azido 2 azetidinone starting material can be prepared by first reacting an oleo in having the formulaEMI22.1 with a halosulfonylisocyanate preferably chloro sulfonylisocyanate having the formula XXVI O C N SO2 halogen to yield an azetidinone having the formulaEMI22.2 Reductive hydrolysis of an azetidinone of formulaXXVII yields an N unsubstituted i lactam having the formulaEMI22.3 For a more detailed description of the above described reaction sequence reference can be made to the literature see, for example, Chem. Soc. Rev., 5, 181 1976 and J. Org. Chem., 35, 2043 1970 . An azido group can be introduced in the 3position of an azetidinone of formula XXVIII or the sulfonated counterpart by reaction of the compound with an arylsulfonyl azide such as toluenesulfonyl azide to obtain a starting azetidinone having the formula EMI23.1 The reaction proceeds best by first protecting the azetidinone nitrogen with a silyl residue e.g., t butyldimethylsilyl, or t butyldiphenylsilyl , then generating the anion at the 3 position of the nucleus with a strong organic base e.g., lithium diisopropylamine at a low temperature, and then treating the anion with toluenesulfonyl azide. The resulting intermediate is quenched with trimethylsilyl chloride, and subsequent acid hydrolysis or fluoride solvolysis of the N protecting group yields the compound of formula XXIX. Alternatively, the compound of Formula XXXI can be obtained by first reacting a primary amine having the formulaEMI23.2 with an aldehyde of the formula R3CH O to yield the corresponding Schiff base. A 2 2 cycloaddition with an activated form of azido acetic acid yields a 3azido 2 azetidinone having the formulaEMI23.3 wherein Q isEMI24.1 Oxidative removal of the Q substituent yields the compound of formula XXIX. The 3 acylamino 2 azetidinones can be obtained by first reducing a 3 azido 2 azetidinone of formulaXXX. to obtain the corresponding 3 amino 2 azetidinone and then acylating the 3 amino 2 azetidinone. As previously mentioned in the case where R2 is lower alkoxy, the product can be prepared from the counterpart product wherein R 2 is hydrogen.Clorination of the amide nitrogen of a nonalkoxylated compound yields an intermediate having the formulaEMI24.2 Reagents and procedures for N chlorinating amides are known in the art. Exemplary reagents are tert. butyl hypochlorite, sodium hypochlorite, and chlorine. The reaction can be run in an organic solvent e.g., Ã  lower alkanol such as methanol or in a two phase solvent system e.g., water methylene chloride in the presence of a base such as sodium borate decahydrate.The reaction is preferably run at a reduced temperature. Reaction of an intermediate of formula XXIX with an alkoxylating agent, e.g., an alkali metal alkoxide yields a product of formula I wherein R2 is alkoxy, in combination with its enantiomer. The reaction can be run in an inorganic solvent, e.g., a polar organic solvent such as dimethylformamide, at a reduced temperature. An alternative synthesis for preparing the compounds of formula I wherein R2 is alkoxy comprises first alkoxylating an intermediate of formula VI wherein R1NH is a carbamate e.g., R1 is benzyloxycarbonyl and R2 is hydrogen and then introducing a sulfo group in the l position of the resulting compound. Chlorination of a compound of formula VI using the procedure described above for chlorination of a non alkoxylated compound of formulaI to yield a compound of formula XXX yields an intermediate having the formulaEMI25.1 Using the alkoxylation procedure described above for converting a compound of formula XXX to a product of formula I , and subsequently adding a reducing agent such as trimethylphosphite, the compound of formula XXX can be converted to an intermediate having the formulaEMI25.2 in a combination with its enantiomer. The above procedures yield those products of formula I wherein R2 is alkoxy as a racemic mixture.If desired the enantiomer having the R configuration can be isolated from the racemic mixture using conventional techniques such as fractional crystallization of a suitable salt with an optically active organic amine or by ion paired chromatography utilizing an optically active cation.
