# Valve mechanism for low temperature applications.

## Abstract
A low temperature valve mechanism has a housing 62, 64, 66 in which is mounted a valve stem 20 carrying at one end a valve member 52 which cooperates with a valve seat 60 surrounding a vent opening 56 in a cryogenic tank 14 . A bias spring 102 acts between the top of the valve housing and the rod 20 and biases the valve member 52 into the closed position. The housing is mounted externally on a heat insulating outer shell 12 surrounding the tank so that the bias spring 102 is not subject to the low temperature of the tank 14 . A pressure chamber 84 is formed between the rod 20 and the housing. By supplying fluid under pressure through a conduit 88 a force can be exerted on the rod 20 against the action of the spring 102 to open the valve 52, 60 .
