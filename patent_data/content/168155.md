# Method for testing components of a magnetic storage system.

## Abstract
A method for measuring bit shift and other characteris tics indicative of the performance of a magnetic storage system, particularly for a system employing a thin film magnetic head. In a preferred embodiment, complementary patterns are written many times around a circular track 10a of a magnetic disk 10 , each pattern including relatively closely spaced magnetic transitions TR2,TR3 as well as relatively widely spaced magnetic transitions TR1,TR2 . The relatively widely spaced transitions TR1,TR2 are chosen so as to be substantially unaffected by any other transitions. Measurements are made with reference to these widely spaced transitions TR1,TR2 and averaged for the many patterns recorded in the track so as to rapidly provide highly reliable measurements indicative of system performance.
