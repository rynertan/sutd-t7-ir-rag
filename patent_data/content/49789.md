# Screening apparatus.

## Abstract
Apparatus for screening pulp slurry has an annular screening zone 60 in the space between a screen 58 of circular cross section and a closed surface drum 18 carry ing pulse creating means 64 . The screen 58 and drum 18 are coaxially mounted for relative rotation about their common axis. Means 68 are provided for feeding the slurry which have at least one inlet 94, 96 to the space and extend substantially the full axial length of the screening zone 60 . Means 72, 74 are also provided for removing from the space rejects not passing through the screen 58 which means have at least one rejects outlet 82, 84 from the space extending substantially the full axial length of the screening zone 60 . Slurry passing through the screen is received in at least one accepts compartment 104, 106 from which it is discharged by means 70.
