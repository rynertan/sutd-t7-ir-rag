# FUNGICIDAL POLYPEPTIDE COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING L HISTIDINE

## Abstract
Polypeptides containing a substantial proportion of L histidine are effective fungicidal agents. They are particu larly effective against S. mutans and C. albicans and have a high degree of safety and nontoxicity because of their structural similarity to naturally occurring histidine rich polypeptides which are unique to the salivas of humans and old world monkeys.
