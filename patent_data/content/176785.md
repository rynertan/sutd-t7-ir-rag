## Description
This invention relates to a wheel slip control system for controlling a frictional force between a tire of a driving wheel and the road surface not only during braking but also during acceleration of a car, and more particularly to a wheel slip control system which controls rotation of a driving wheel in response to an output power of an internal combustion engine. A wheel slip control system is known from DE A 31 27 302 which discloses a system for controlling the propulsive drive applied to motor vehicle wheels, particularly having hydraulically operated disc brakes, in the sense of preventing undesired spinning of the driven vehicle wheels in order to obtain a desired vehicle behaviour in critical driving situations, especially under extreme road conditions. In the system, a comparator is provided which is triggered by at least one presettable or permanently preset threshold value corresponding to the speed of the vehicle, and which generates an output signal causing the drive torque to be reduced as soon as the threshold value is exceeded and a signal is present, which indicates that the individual wheel brake is being activated and or that one of the driven wheels is tending to spin. The control system comprises a first control loop which reacts to the state of motion of at least the driven vehicle wheels and which, when one of these wheels is tending to spin, activates its wheel brake, and comprises a second control loop applying a torque reducing control action to the drive unit of the vehicle when values preferably being determined from the wheel rotation speeds of the undriven vehicle wheels and representing the speed and the acceleration of the vehicle exceed the threshold value. The threshold value of the speed of the vehicle which value governs the control process, is preferably regulated in accordance with the transverse acceleration which acts on the vehicle whenever it follows a curved path, thus performing a control of the vehicle behaviour depending on the detected vehicle speed and being additionally adapted to the vehicle cornering state. This document also discloses the use of a conventional anti skid brake system in combination with the mentioned wheel slip control system. Furthermore, document DE A 18 06 671 discloses an electrically controlled system for preventing a spinning of the driven wheels of a vehicle in which the rotational slippage between the driven and non driven wheels is determined, and in which the rotational speed of the driven wheels is controlled dependent on the magnitude of such a slippage. To this end, the hydraulic circuit of the system is provided with a single pressure source including a pressure tank supplied by a pump and a plurality of valves being energized or deenergized in accordance with the detected slippage to supply the respective wheel brakes with the required hydraulic pressure. In a normal operating condition the vehicle brake can be actuated in a conventional manner by means of a brake pedal. When a slippage of the driven wheels in relation to a non driven wheel is detected, a special inlet valve is opened to provide the wheel brakes of the driven wheels with a hydraulic pressure. In order to deactivate the entire control system during the actuation of the brake pedal, a contact is connected with a brake light switch, the signal of which serves to control the respective magnetic valves accordingly, since the whole hydraulic circuit is based on only one single pressure source used for controlling both the acceleration and braking slippage. Such anti skid brake systems are known which control the rotation of a wheel to provide an optimum braking force during braking of a car without causing a wheel lock. In this type of system, a rotational speed of the wheel hereinafter referred to as the wheel speed is controlled, during braking of the car, rather below a travelling speed of the car hereinafter referred to as the car speed so as to provide a maximum frictional force between the tire of the wheel and the road surface. In particular, when the car speed is indicated by Vs and a wheel speed by V, a slip ratio S is determined by a following equation While various slip controls for braking a car have been proposed so far wherein safety steps are taken so that if a driver brakes the car very quickly, the car may be stopped at a minimum distance without causing a side slip of the car, proposals for traction control which is the control of a slip during the acceleration of the car have been limited only to such that an output power of an engine is controlled when an acceleration slip occurs at a wheel, and efforts have not been made enough to attain optimum control of the acceleration of the car. Moreover, conventional traction controls have a drawback that the running condition of an internal combustion engine may produce vibrations or cause deterioration of exhaust gas emission very quickly since an output of the engine is controlled by ignition timing and air fuel ratio. They also have another drawback in responsitivity of control since a time is required until the engine torque is lowered after the ignition timing control or the air fuel ratio control has been initiated. It is a first object of the present invention to provide an improved wheel slip control system which, when a slip occurs during acceleration or deceleration of a car, can control a frictional force between a tire of a driving wheel and the road surface in good responsitivity without deteriorating the drivability of the car. It is a second object of the invention to provide a wheel slip control system which can make use of pressure of a hydraulic oil source of a conventional anti skid brake system to attain quick responsitivity of control as a system for controlling a brake system without the necessity of wide modification of a conventional anti skid brake system. In order to attain these objects, a wheel slip control system according to the present invention comprises Accordingly, the wheel slip control system, in order to perform an accurate traction control of the driving wheels controls the frictional force between a tire of a driving wheel and the road surface by using a conventional hydraulic anti skid brake system without wide modifications of the same, thus, ensuring a good responsitivity of the traction control system. On the one hand, the anti skid brake system which is connected to the braking means operates such that a hydraulic pressure received from the braking means according to the driver s will and in response to a slip signal outputted from the slip detecting means during a decelleration of the car is supplied to the individual wheel brakes under control of the hydraulic pressure supplied from the pressure source of the anti skid brake system via a control valve in order to prevent a braking slip of the driving wheels. On the other hand, the traction control means, which is connected to the slip detecting means and to the anti skid control means operates such that depending on the detected slip of the driving wheels during an acceleration of the car, individual wheel brakes of the driving wheels are provided with a hydraulic pressure of the pressure source via the control valve in order to apply an appropriate braking source to the driving wheels to prevent the driving wheels from slipping during the acceleration of the car. With respect to the fact that two independent control processes use the same hydraulic control system of the anti skid control means for controlling the individual wheel brakes of the driving wheels and, thus, form two interconnected control loops, it is necessary to clearly define the conditions on the basis of which one of the control loops is given preference in using the hydraulic control system. Thus, according to the present invention, another hydraulic system is connected to the braking means, to the first hydraulic system and to the traction control means for providing the first hydraulic system with a higher pressure which can instantaneously be selected either from the hydraulic pressure of the braking means, if the driver intends to reduce the driving speed, or from the hydraulic pressure of the pressure source if a slip of the driving wheels under acceleration is detected. The higher hydraulic pressure is then supplied to the individual wheel brakes of the driving wheels. In particular, during the acceleration of the car and the traction control, or the brake means is sufficiently operated by the driver, the hydraulic pressure of the brake means is applied to the driving wheels via the other hydraulic system and the first hydraulic system. In order to have the present invention understood more concretely, the invention will be described in more detail in connection with a preferred embodiment thereof. Fig. 2 is a schematic diagram of a braking hydraulic system and a controlling system therefor in a car on which a wheel slip control system of a first embodiment of the present invention is installed. Referring to Fig. 2, reference numeral 1 denotes a first hydraulic system of a conventional anti skid brake system and 3 a further hydraulic system newly provided afresh for traction control. In particular, if a foot brake 5 is treadled to operate a master cylinder 7 of the tandem type, a braking force is produced at both of left and right front wheels FL, FR and left and right rear wheels RL, RR corresponding to a hydraulic pressure, and the first hydraulic system 1 of the anti skid brake system for suitably varying the hydraulic pressure of the hydraulic circuit is provided in the hydraulic circuit. Fig. 2 shows only a hydraulic oil path for the rear wheels RR and RL in detail for simplification. Rotational speeds of the front and rear wheels RR, RL, FR and FL to which a braking force is applied in such a manner as described above are detected by a car speed sensor 8A and a wheel speed sensor 8B and are transmitted to an electronic controlling device 9. The car speed sensor 8A calculates an average of rotational speeds of the left and right front wheels FL and FR and thus outputs a signal which is regarded as a travelling speed of the car while the wheel speed sensor 8B outputs a signal indicative of a rotational speed of a driving wheel RL only. Now, detailed construction of each system will be described. At first, the first hydraulic system 1 of the anti skid brake system includes a cut valve 14 to which a flow of oil is changed over by means of a three position solenoid valve 13 from a hydraulic source of an accumulator 12 which stores therein oil to be fed under pressure by a hydraulic pump 11, a bypass valve 15 for assuring operation of the braking hydraulic circuit when the hydraulic source gets out of order and so on, a reservoir 16 for temporarily storing excessive oil therein, and a hydraulic switch 17 for detecting a hydraulic pressure of the hydraulic source to provide an output when a predetermined hydraulic pressure is obtained. Fig. 2 indicates the first hydraulic system 1 when the anti skid brake system does not operate. A piston of the bypass valve 15 is normally held upward by oil pressure from the accumulator 12 which is maintained at a high pressure by the pump 11 so that oil from a pressure change over valve 31 which will be hereinafter described does not go into the bypass valve 15 and all flows into the cut valve 14. At this instant, a piston of the cut valve 14 is also held upward since the three position valve 13 is connected at an A port thereof to the cut valve 14. The upward pressure of the accumulator 12 is higher than the pressure of the pressure change over valve 31, and accordingly oil which flows into the cut valve 14 from the pressure change over valve 31 goes out of an upper chamber of the cut valve 14, passing a bypass path 18 and then an upper chamber of the bypass valve 15, and provides a braking force to the driving wheels RR and RL. In other words, the bypass valve 15 only acts as a bypass hydraulic path which imparts a braking force to driving wheels RR and RL via an upper chamber of the bypass valve 15 so far as the hydraulic pressure from the accumulator 12 is normal while the cut valve 14 holds the capacity of the upper chamber thereof to its minimum and unchangeable when the three position valve 13 is connected at the A port thereof to the cut valve 14 so that the braking hydraulic pressure can be controlled only by a pressure of the pressure change over valve 31. If the anti skid brake system discriminates in response to some signal that it is necessary to reduce the hydraulic pressure imparted from the pressure change over valve 31 to the driving wheels RR and RL to reduce the braking force thereof, the electronic controlling device 9 actuates the three position valve 13 to connect a C port of the latter to the first hydraulic system 1. Then, the pressure in a lower chamber below the piston of the cut valve 14 becomes equal to the low pressure of the reservoir 16, and as a result, the piston is pushed down by the pressure of the pressure change over valve 31 to increase the volume of oil and lower the hydraulic pressure in the upper chamber of the cut valve 14 which has provided the braking force to the driving wheels RR and RL, resulting in reduction in the braking force. Then, if a B port of the three position valve 13 is connected to the first hydraulic system 1 after the piston of the cut valve 14 has been lowered to a position at which a suitable braking force can be obtained, then the movement of the piston of the cut valve 14 will be ended and the pressure in the upper chamber of the cut valve 14 which provides a braking force will be fixed. In the meantime, if the first hydraulic system 1 of the anti skid brake system becomes out of order by any reason so that the pressure of the accumulator 12 becomes low, then the piston of the bypass valve 15 moves down so that a spherical valve at the top of the piston divides a valve body into an upper chamber and a lower chamber while the cut valve 14 is divided into two upper and lower chambers as the piston thereof moves down. Then, the pressure of the pressure change over valve 31 is introduced directly into the upper chamber of the bypass valve 15 to form a new further hydraulic system 3 which will provide a braking force to the driving wheels RR and RL to assure a braking operation at least based upon the will of a driver. Now, the further hydraulic system 3 which is provided anew for traction control will be described. At first, while a hydraulic system of a conventional anti skid brake system is constructed such that pressure oil from the master cylinder 7 of the foot brake is directly introduced into the cut valve 14 and the bypass valve 15, the pressure change over valve 31 is provided anew in the further hydraulic system 3 such that oil pressure may be introduced into the two valves 14 and 15 via the pressure change over valve 31. The pressure change over valve 31 is a valve of the 2 input 1 output type which selectively outputs one of two inputs which is higher in pressure than the other. The master cylinder 7 of the foot brake 5 is connected to one of the two inputs of the pressure change over valve 31 while another cylinder 32 is connected to the other input. The above described accumulator 12 serves as a power source for operating the cylinder 32, and a two position valve 33 which is controlled by the electronic controlling device 9 intermits connection between the accumulator 12 and the cylinder 32. The electronic controlling device 9 detects a condition of the braking hydraulic system 3 as described above and produces a controlling output depending upon such detection. In particular, the electronic controlling device 9 receives three output signals from the car speed sensor 8A, the wheel speed sensor 8B and the hydraulic switch 17 as detection information of the braking hydraulic system 3 and controls the pump 11, the three position valve 13 and the two position valve 33 within the hydraulic system 3 in accordance with results of such detection. Fig. 2 illustrates a block diagram wherein the electronic controlling device 9 is constructed as an example from digital circuits including a microcomputer at the center thereof. Referring to Fig. 2, reference symbol 9A 1 denotes a CPU which carries out operation, 9A 2 a ROM which stores a controlling program and various constants therein, 9A 4 an input output port which outputs controlling signals for operating several hydraulic valves and the pump 11 in the first hydraulic system 1 and which shapes and receives a signal from the hydraulic switch 17, 9A 5 an input port which receives signals from the two speed sensors 8A and 8B, and 9A 6 a bus line forming a passage of information. The wheel slip controlling system of the present embodiment having such a construction as described above operates in accordance with a flow chart illustrated in Fig. 3. The flow chart indicates a wheel slip controlling routine which is stored in prior in the ROM 9A 2 and is executed repeatedly every predetermined period of time to control a slip of wheels. If the CPU 9A 1 advances into a process of the wheel slip controlling routine, at first step 100 is executed to discriminate if the pressure of the first hydraulic system 1 is normal or not. The pressure of the accumulator 12 of the anti skid brake system is detected by the hydraulic switch 17 as described hereinabove, and if the pressure lowers, the hydraulic switch 17 will provide no output. Thus, the output of the hydraulic switch 17 is monitored, and if there is no output from the hydraulic switch 17, step 110 is once executed to operate the pump 11 to raise the pressure of the accumulator 12 until there appears an output of the hydraulic switch 17 again. On the contrary, if there is an output of the hydraulic switch 17 and thus the pressure is discriminated as normal, there is no necessity of executing the process of step 110 and control advances directly to next step 120. A step 120, it is discriminated if the car is now being accelerated or decelerated. In particular, acceleration is calculated from a frequency of pulse signals from the car speed sensor 8A and it is discriminated if a result of the calculation is equal to or over zero. And if it is discriminated that the result is equal to or over zero, that is, the car is being accelerated, control advances to step 130 to execute a following traction control. On the contrary, if it is discriminated that the result is below zero and the car is being decelerated, then step 140 is executed to reset a counter C which is used in the traction control as hereinafter described whereafter the present routine is finished and another routine for a conventional anti skid control not shown will be executed. At step 130, as a first discrimination for executing the traction control, it is discriminated if the driving wheels RR and RL are rotating at higher speed than an upper limit value for the driving wheel rotational speed. Here, the upper limit value means a speed represented by a line Vh illustrated in A of Fig. 4 and is a rotatinal speed at which a maximum frictional force acts on the driving wheels RR and RL as calculated from the detection result Vc of the car speed sensor 8A, that is, an upper limit value within a range of rotational speed of the driving wheels RR and RL at which the slip ratio becomes 10 or so. Reference symbol Vℓ in A of Fig. 4 indicates a lower limit value of the range. If at step 130 the detection result Vr of the wheel speed sensor 8B which is the rotational speed of the driving wheels RR and RL is discriminated as Vr Vh, then step 150 is executed to set the counter C to a predetermined positive integer, and then at the following step 160, a changing over operation is executed to change over the two position valve 33 to a pressurizing side wherein the pressure of the accumulator 12 is imparted to the pressure change over valve 31. By this changing over operation, a braking pressure is applied to the cut valve 14 so that a braking force acts upon the driving wheels RR and RL. Then, step 170 is executed to discriminate if the rotational speed Vr and the accerelation αr of the driving wheel RL exceed their respective upper limit values. Here, the upper and lower limit values of the acceleration mean predetermined values αh and αℓ as respectively, illustrated in B of Fig. 4, and represent upper and lower limit values of the acceleration which can assume while a large frictional force is maintained between the driving wheels RR and RL and the road surface as estimated from the weight of the car, a load to the driving wheels RR and RL, and so on. Accordingly, when the condition of step 170 is met, the rotation of the driving wheels RR and RL involves a large slip, and thus step 180 is executed to carry out a changing over control to the A port of the three position valve 13 wherein pressurization from the pressure change over valve 31 to the cut valve 14 all acts as a braking force. On the contrary, if at step 170 it is not discriminated that the condition is met, it is discriminated at step 190 if the actual rotational speed Vr and acceleration r of the driving wheels RR and RL are higher or not than the lower limit values Vℓ and αℓ for the speed and acceleration, respectively. Thus, if they are discriminated as higher, then the magnitude of a braking force to the driving wheels RR and RL is regarded as suitable at present and the three position valve 13 is changed over to the B port to maintain constant volume of the upper chamber which imparts the braking force of the cut valve 14 step 200 . Conversely, if it is discriminated at step 190 that either one or both of the speed and the acceleration are below the lower limit value or values thereof, it is regarded that a braking force greater than a required level is applied to the driving wheels RR and RL so that the C port of the three position valve 13 is connected to the hydraulic system to increase the volume of the upper chamber of the cut valve 14 and to reduce the braking force to the driving wheels RR and RL step 210 . Meanwhile, processes of steps 220 to 250 which are executed when it is discriminated at step 130 that the condition is not met are provided to set a delay time to control of the two position valve 33. As described hereinabove, when it is discriminated at step 130 that the condition is met, the two position valve 33 which is normally at a pressure discommunicating side wherein the pressure of the accumulator 12 is not imparted to the pressure change over valve 31, and thus the brake is rendered effective by the pressure of the accumulator 12. After then, the three position valve 13 is suitably actuated to accomplish traction control to obtain an optimum driving force in order to effect fine control of the braking force corresponding to variations of the rotational speed Vr and the acceleration αr of the driving wheels RR and RL. But when the present routine is executed again after lapse of the predetermined period of time, if at step 130 it is discriminated that the rotational speed Vr of the driving wheels RR and RL is not over the upper limit value therefor and the two position valve 33 is promptly changed over to the pressure discommunicating side, then the braking force which has acted upon the driving wheels RR and RL so far will disappear completely and thus vibrations due to such control may be brought about to the car. Therefore, while the two position valve 33 is held to the pressure communicating side to produce a braking force only for the predetermined period of time after it has been discriminated that the condition of step 130 is met no more, the braking force of the driving wheels RR and RL is controlled by the three position valve 13. Accordingly, if it is discriminated at step 130 that the condition is not met, at first step 220 is executed to determine if the contents of the counter C which was set at step 150 are greater than zero or not, and if C 0, then the counter C is decremented at step 230, and then if it is discriminated at step 240 that the new contents of the counter C are not zero, then the aforementioned steps including step 160 are executed again. However, if C 0, it is regarded that the two position valve 33 is held to the pressure communicating side for the predetermined period of time so that control now proceeds to step 250 at which the two position valve 33 is changed over to the pressure discommunicating side to effect control of the next steps including 180 is executed without decrementing the counter C again in accordance with the discrimination at step 220. Controls of the two position valve 33 and the three position valve 13 which are executed in the control of the present step are illustrated in C and D of Fig. 4. As shown in C and D of Fig. 4, once the two position valve 33 is rendered operative, it effects transmission of pressure to produce a braking force until the car is brought to a stabilized accelerating condition due to a delay time Td of the two position valve 33, that is, the time preset by the counter while the three position valve 13 suitably changes over the three ports thereof to adjust the braking force to execute the traction control. The present embodiment thus indicates an excellent example of constitution of a wheel slip controlling system which can attain traction control during acceleration of a car as shown in A of Fig. 4 only by additionally providing a hydraulic controlling system 3 for traction control as described above. In other words, if a first hydraulic system 1 of an anti skid brake system which is conventionally installed on a car is utilized and a constant braking force is provided to driving wheels RR and RL by means of a newly provided further hydraulic system 3, then the braking force is thereafter regulated by the same control with the anti skid brake system. Besides, even if the same electronic controlling device 9 with the anti skid brake system is used, since a slip controlling routine as illustrated in Fig. 3 is executed during acceleration of the car whereas another slip controlling routine for known anti skid braking not shown is executed during deceleration, the same electronic controlling device 9 is used commonly and thus a control system having good operability can be constructed. Moreover, since the hydraulic control of the anti skid brake system is designed to allow finer pressure control than a conventional one, fine traction control can be attained readily. It is to be noted that while in the present embodiment control of the braking force is all accomplished by the common three position valve 13 of the anti skid brake system in order to simply attain such excellent effects as described above, the two position valve 33 may otherwise be replaced by a three position valve which is controlled to regulate the braking hydraulic pressure itself which is provided to the pressure change over valve 31. Control of the three position valve 13 in the latter case may be one which executes substantially the same routine as that of Fig. 3, and when the rotational speed and acceleration of driving wheels RR and RL both exceed the respective upper limit values therefor, the pressure of the accumulator 12 may be imparted to the pressure change over valve 31, but when they are both lower than the respective lower limit values therefor, the pressure of the accumulator 12 may be reduced and when in any other conditions, the braking force may be maintained constant. Now, a second embodiment will be described wherein the electronic controlling device 9 is constructed from electronic circuits without using a microcomputer. The second embodiment has, in hardware, a circuitry construction as illustrated in Fig. 5. Referring to Fig. 5, reference symbols 9B 1 and 9B 2 denote F V converters for converting a frequency of pulse signals developed from left and right idle wheel speed sensors 8A 1 and 8A 2 and corresponding to rotations of idle wheels into a voltage signal, respectively, reference symbol 9B 3 designates an adder for adding the thus converted voltage signal to obtain a voltage Bf corresponding to the travelling speed of the car hereinafter referred to as a car speed voltage , 9B 4 a differentiator for differentiating the car speed voltage Bf to obtain a voltage Bf corresponding to an acceleration of the car hereinafter referred to as a car acceleration voltage , and 9B 5 a comparator for comparing the car acceleration voltage Bf with the ground voltage 0 volt to determine if the car is being accelerated or not. Further, reference symbol 9B 6 denotes an F V converter for converting a frequency of pulse signals developed from the wheel speed sensor 8B into a voltage signal, 9B 7 an amplifier for amplifying the voltage signal from the F V converter 9B 6 to a voltage corresponding to the car speed voltage Bf obtained from the adder 9B 3 to obtain a driving wheel speed voltage Br indicative of the speed Vr of driving wheels RR and RL, and 9B 8 a differentiator for differentiating the driving wheel speed voltage Br to output a driving wheel acceleration voltage Br. In addition, reference symbols 9B 9 and 9B 10 denote adders for adding predetermined voltages B1 and B2 to the car speed voltage Bf developed from the adder 9B 3 and corresponding to the travelling speed of the car to output reference voltages Bf1 and Bf2 for determination of a degree of an acceleration slip of the car, respectively, 9B 11 and 9B 12 comparators for comparing the reference voltages Bf1 and Bf2 output from the adders 9B 9 and 9B 10 with the driving wheel speed voltage Br output from the amplifier 9B 7 to output voltage signals Bfℓ and Bfh of a high level when Bf1 Br and Bf2 Br, respectively, and 9B 13 and 9B 14 further comparators for comparing the driving wheel acceleration voltage Br output from the differentiator 9B 8 with predetermined voltages B3 and B4 to output voltage signals Brℓ and Brh of a high level when Br B3 and Br B4, respectively. The voltage signals Bfℓ and Brℓ output from the comparators 9B 11 and 9B 13 are input to an AND circuit 9B 15. A voltage signal Bℓ output from the AND circuit 9B 15 is input to another AND circuit 9B 30 at the next stage, and a signal Bℓ output from the AND circuit 9B 30 is provided via an amplifier 9B 16 to the base of a transistor Tr1 as a controlling signal for changing over the three position valve 13 to the A port or to the C port. The voltage signals Bfh and Brh output from the comparators 9B 12 and 9B 14, respectively, are input to a further AND circuit 9B 17, and a signal from the hydraulic switch 17 is also input to the AND circuit 9B 17 via a NOT circuit 9B 18. A voltage signal Bh output from the AND circuit 9B 17 is input to a yet further AND circuit 9B 31 from which a voltage signal Bh is output The voltage signal Bh is applied via an amplifier 9B 19 to the base of another transistor Tr2 as a controlling signal for changing over the three position valve 13 to the B port. Further, an output of an AND circuit 9B 21 is input via the AND circuits 9B 30 and 9B 31 to the amplifiers 9B 19 and 9B 16, respectively. Accordingly, the three position valve 13 is normally controlled to the A port. Meanwhile, a voltage signal which is output from the comparator 9B 5 and indicates that the car is in an accelerating condition, another voltage signal output from the comparator 9B 12 via a delay circuit 9B 20 and a further voltage signal output from the hydraulic switch 17 via the NOT circuit 9B 18 are input to an AND circuit 9B 21. An output terminal of the AND circuit 9B 21 is connected to provide an actuating signal an amplifier 9B 22 via the two position valve 33. It is apparent that the circuit construction as described above can attain such control of the two position valve 33 and the three position valve 13 as seen in Fig. 4. In particular, the delay circuit 9B 20 corresponds to means for producing a delay of control of the counter C provided by the above described steps 220 to 240 while a signal amplified by the amplifier 9B 19 corresponds to results of determination provided by step 180 and a signal amplified by the amplifier 9B 16 corresponds to the process at step 200. In this manner, the components of the embodiments described above may be suitably chosen without departing from the scope of the present invention. Now, description will be given of a second embodiment of the invention. The second embodiment is different from the first embodiment in that it additionally includes a differential pressure switch 31a and the change over valve 31 is replaced by a pressure change over valve 31 while four new steps are additionally provided to the flowchart. In particular, referring to Fig. 6, the differential pressure switch 31a is additionally provided to the embodiment of Fig. 2 and develops a signal to the electronic controlling device 9 when the pressure on the master cylinder 7 side is higher. The pressure change over switch 31 is changed over in response to an output of the differential pressure switch 31a. The electronic controlling device 9 detects such conditions of the braking hydraulic system 1 as described above and develops controlling outputs depending upon results of such detections. In particular, the electronic controlling device 9 receives, as detection information of the braking hydraulic system 1, output signals of the car speed sensor 8A, wheel speed sensor 8B, hydraulic switch 17 and differential pressure switch 31a and controls the pump 11, three position valve 13, pressure change over valve 31 and two position valve 33 of the first hydraulic system 1 depending upon results of such detections. A flowchart of Fig. 7 will now be described. The flowchart is drawn for the second embodiment and includes additional steps 132, 134, 136 and 138 to the flowchart of Fig. 3. If the detection result Vr of the wheel speed sensor 8B which indicates the rotational speed of the driving wheels is determined as Vr Vh at step 130, then the two position valve 33 is energized at step 132 to prepare hydraulic oil pressure for traction control. Then at step 134, the differential pressure switch 31a is checked it develops an output or not. Here, if there is an output from the differential pressure switch 31a, it is determined YES as the brake pedal 5 is treadled down sufficiently, and then at step, the counter C is reset to zero whereafter the change over valve 31 is deenergized or held deenergized at step 138. Thereafer, step 180 is executed to change over the three position valve 13 to the A port. As described above, if the car is being accelerated and the brake pedal 5 is treadled down sufficiently, the hydraulic pressure of the brake master cylinder 7 is imparted to the wheels via the hydraulic pressure change over valve 31, cut valve 14 and bypass valve 15 as it is. Thus, slipping control in accordance with the will of a driver during acceleration can be attained. On the contrary, if there is no output from the differential pressure switch 31a at step 134 and it is determined NO , subsequently step 150 is executed so that a predetermined positive integer is set to the counter C. Then, by the process of next step 160, the solenoid of the pressure change over valve 31 is energized so that the pressure of the accumulator 12 is applied as a braking pressure to the cut valve 14 via the two position valve 33, cylinder 32 and pressure change over valve 31. Since the two brake oil pressures are instantaneously selected by the pressure change over valve 31 of the electromangetic type, interference of the two hydraulic circuits and inadvertent application of a pressure to wheel cylinders of the brake system for the wheels can be prevented. Accordingly, responsiveness and pedal feeling are improved comparing with a change valve such as a shuttle valve which automatically selects a higher pressure side depending upon a difference in pressure. Besides, oil consumption for changing over becomes unnecessary. It is to be noted that changing over of the hydraulic pressure by the pressure change over valve 31 as in the present embodiment would provide such effects as described below in assembly of a car. In particular, while de aeration of a hydraulic circuit is one of difficult works when the hydraulic circuit is to be constructed, such deairing operation can be carried out simply since air in the hydraulic circuit of the cylinder 32 can be extracted to the reservoir 16 if the hydraulic pressure of the hydraulic circuit of the brake master cylinder 7 is raised after the hydraulic circuit is deaired by a normal process and the pressure change over 31 is repeatedly turned on and off. A timing chart for the second embodiment is similar to that of Fig. 4 for the first embodiment. The present embodiment can also be constructed with an electronic circuit in place of the microcomputer. This modification is similar to that of Fig. 5 of the first embodiment and includes an additional electronic controlling device 9C as described below. In particular, the electronic controlling device 9C includes, as shown in Fig. 8, an inverter 9C 1 and an amplifier 9C 2 for inverting and amplifying an output signal of the differential pressure switch 31a to drive the pressure change over valve 31. When there is no output signal from the differential pressure switch 31a, the pressure change over valve 31 will impart the hydraulic pressure of the accumulator 12 side to the brake system for the wheels.
