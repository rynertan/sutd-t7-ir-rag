# Sintered stainless steel and production process therefor.

## Abstract
A sintered stainless steel exhibiting improved resistance to stress corrosion cracking which comprises a matrix phase and a dispersed phase and a process for manufacturing same are disclosed. The dispersed phase is of an austenitic metallurgical structure and is dispersed throughout the matrix phase which is comprised of an austenitic metallur gical structure having a steel composition different from that of the dispersed phase or a ferrite austenite duplex stainless steel.
