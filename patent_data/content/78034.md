# Data processing machine suitable for high speed processing.

## Abstract
A data processing machine for high speed processing especially of programs involving repeated executions of operational steps is disclosed, which comprises A first memory for storing destination addresses of data a second memory being accessed with the destination addresses output from said first memory and storing instructions therein a third memory for receiving the data and holding it therein temporarily a fourth memory allowing the data sent from said third memory to wait for another an arithmetic means executing arithmetic operation in accordance with the instructions read out from said second memory a bus for coupling said first memory, second memory, third memory, fourth memory and said arithmetic means into a ring shape and a means for storing the destination addresses and the instruction transferred from the outside into said first and second memories, respectively. By this structure the arith metic means and the first to fourth memories are formed in a pipe line mode, the instructions input through the interface part are stored in the second memory, and arithmetic processing for data flowing through the ring shaped bus is executed in the arithmetic means in accordance with instruc tions which are fetched from the second memory. The sequence of operations in the pipe line mode can be programmably controlled in accordance with the arranged instructions in the second memory.
