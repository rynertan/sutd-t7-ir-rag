# SPEED CONTROL APPARATUS AND METHOD

## Abstract
A rotary propeller 22 can act as the rotor of a ram air turbine for driving a load 64 or as a propulsion propeller driven by an engine 64 and the speed of the rotor 22 is controlled by rotating a reference shaft 37 at a controlled speed by a motor 58 and varying the pitch of the rotor blades 24 in dependence on any difference between the speeds of rotation of the rotor and the shaft 37 to tend to reduce that difference. In particular when the rotor is to be stopped, the shaft 37 is stopped and the blades 24 are feathered.
