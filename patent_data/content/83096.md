## Description
DESCRIPTION PRODUCTION OF URETHANE COMPOUNDSTechnical Field This invention relates to the production of urethane compounds. More particularly, it relates to processes for producing urethane compounds by oxidative carbonylation which comprise reacting at least one compound selected from the group consisting of a primary amine, a secondary amine and a urea compound with carbon monoxide and an organic hydroxyl compound in the presence of an oxidizing agent and a specified catalyst system.Background Art Urethane compounds are important compounds useful for carbamate type agricultural medicines, and for conversion to isocyanate compounds by thermal decomposition. Such compounds have heretofore been available principally by reactions involving dangerous phosgene.Thus, it is desired to produce urethane compounds as the starting materials for the production of isocyanate compounds without using phosgene, and to do so at low cost. Heretofore, there have been proposed mainly two methods for the production of urethane compounds using carbon monoxide. More specifically, one method comprises reductively urethanating a nitro compound in the presence of an alcohol. For example, in the case of nitrobenzene, the reaction may be represented by the following equation EMI1.1 wherein R represents an organic group. In this reaction, however, 3 mols of carbon monoxide are required per mol of nitrobenzene and two mols of the carbon monoxide are converted to carbon dioxide of no value. Thus, a disadvantage of the process is that only 1 3 of carbon monoxide is effectively employed. Moreover, in order continuously to carry out this reaction, carbon dioxide must be separated from a gaseous mixture of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide.This compounds the difficulties of commercial practice of the method. The other method comprises oxidatively urethanating by reacting a primary amino compound or a N,N disubstituted urea with carbon monoxide and an alcohol in the presence of oxygen or an oxidizing agent such as an organic nitro compound. This method has advantages compared to the above described method since carbon monoxide is effectively utilized. However, it is required that a chloride of an element which is a Lewis acid and yet capable of performing redox reaction, such as cupric chloride, ferric chloride, iron oxychloride, vanadium chloride and vanadium oxychioride, be dissolved in the reaction system as a promoter see U.S.PatentWo.4,297,501, European Patent No.36,895 and U.S.Patent No.4,304,922 . Solutions of these chlorides are highly corrosive to metallic materials of reaction vessels, pipelines and valves. As a result, expensive metallic materials must be used. Further, when an aromatic urethane compound is produced, complicated and expensive procedures are required for the separation and recovery of these chlorides which are dissolved in the high boiling aromatic products such as aromatic urethanes or diarylureas. In addition, these promoters cannot be completely regenerated even by reoxidation in the reaction system since the hydrogen chloride formed in the redox reaction is converted to a hydrochloride of unreacted amine. As a result, there is partially reduced catalyst in the catalyst recovered.Therefore these promoters must be freshly prepared for each reaction. Thus, there has been an urgent need to develop a new process which will avoid the above described problems, and extensive studies have been conducted to achieve this result.Disclosure of the Invention The present invention in one embodiment provides processes for producing urethane compounds which comprise reacting at least one compound selected from the group consisting of a primary amine, a secondary amine and a urea compound with carbon monoxide and an organic hydroxyl compound in the presence of a catalyst system comprising a at least one member selected from the group consisting of platinum group metals and com pounds containing at least one platinum group element and b at least one halogen containing compound selected from tne group consisting of alkali or alkaline earth metal halides, onium halides, compounds capable of forming onium halides in the reaction, oxo acids of halogen atoms and their salts, complex compounds containing halogen ions, organic halides and halogen molecules, in the presence of molecular oxygen and or an organic nitro compound as an oxidizing agent at a temperature of from about 80C to about 3O00C at a pressure of from about 1 Kg cm2 to about 500 Kg cm2. The present invention in another embodiment provides processes for producing urethane compounds which comprise reacting at least one compound selected from the group consisting of a primary amine, a secondary amine and a urea compound with carbon monoxide and an organic hydroxyl compound in the presence of a catalyst system comprising c a basic substance as an additional promoter in addition to the above described components a and b in the presence of molecular oxygen or an organic nitro compound at a temperature of from about 800C to about 3000C at a pressure of from about 1 Kg cm2 to about 500 Kg cm2 . Using the catalyst systems of this invention, urethane compounds can be obtained from primary or secondary amines and urea compounds with. m high selectivity and a high yield. In the catalyst system of this invention, the halogen atom in the halogen containing compound plays an important role as a promoter. The preferred halogen atoms are bromine and iodine, and iodine is more preferred. Such a fact is entirely unexpected from the prior art documents as described above U.S. Patent No.4,297,501 European Patent No. 36,895 and U.S. Patent No.4,304,922 . More specifically, in the prior art references a catalyst comprising, as the main catalyst, a platinum group compound and, as a promoter, a chloride of an element capable of performing redox reaction in the reaction system is employed. As the representative example there is described a combination of palladium chloride and ferric chloride or a trivalent iron such as iron oxychloride.In such a system, the principal product of urethane compound may be considered to be produced according to the so called Wacker reaction type catalyst cycle wherein divalent palladium participates in the reaction and is reduced as the reaction progresses to zero valence palladium which is then re oxidized with trivalent iron to form divalent palladium simultaneously with reduction of trivalent iron to divalent iron, which divalent iron is oxidized again with an oxidizing agent to be returned to trivalent iron. Thus, in the method of the prior art references it is apparent that the chloride of an element which will undergo redox action in the reaction system is essential as the re oxidizing agent for the main catalyst. As the element having such a function, there are mentioned those susceptible of redox reaction selected from the elements of Group IIIa to Va and Group Ib to VIIIb in the PeriodicTable, more specifically, such as copper, zinc, mercury, thallium, tin, titanium, arsenic, antimony, bismuth, vanadium, chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, manganese, iron, cobalt and nickel. Of these elements, only copper, vanadium, manganese, molybdenum, tungsten, antimony and iron are employed for the urethanation of an aromatic primary amine or an aromatic urea compound. There is no example for the urethanation of an aliphatic or alicyclic primary or secondary amine or an urea compound. In contrast, the method of this invention employs specifically selected halogen containing compounds and, if necessary or if desired, a basic substance as an additional promoter. It is completely unnecessary to employ a metal element such as described above which will undergo redox action in the reaction system. It is rather preferred not to utilize such heavy metals for more smoothly advancing the reaction. Furthermore, in the previously known processes a chlorine ion is essential as an activator of the metal element having redox action, while in the reaction of the present invention, chlorine is not essential. In fact, bromine and iodine are preferred and iodine is especially preferred since bromine and iodine appear to give higher yields, and iodine gives the highest.For these reasons, the reactions of this invention are clearly different from the reaction disclosed in the prior art. It may be possible that the halogen containing compound according to this invention contain the above described elements as one constituting component. The mechanism by which the halogen containing compound which can be employed in this invention participates in the reaction is not clear. However, in combination with platinum group metals or compounds containing platinum group elements, they clearly play important roles as the catalyst.components for the oxidative urethanation of primary and secondary amines and urea compounds. This is apparent from the fact that when only the halogencontaining compound is used or such a compound in combination with a basic substance as an additional promoter, the urethanation reaction does not take place.Also, if only the platinum group metal or a compound containing the platinum group element is employed, the urethanationhard ly proceeds under the reaction conditions of this invention, or if there is a reaction, only a small amount of urethane compound is produced. Particularly, when only a metallic platinum group metal is used, harly any urethane compound is obtained. For example, with the use of palladium black alone which is a metallic palladium with zero valency, there is practically no reaction although palladium is one of the more effective catalyst components when employed in accordance with the reaction of this invention.However, together with a halogen containing compound such as cesium iodide or tetramethylammonium iodide or with a combination of the halogen containing compound and a basic substance such as a combination of iodine and trimethylamine, or a combination of iodoform and rubidium hydroxide, it is possible to obtain close to a quantitative yield of urethane compound. There is a particular advantage of the processes of this invention compared to the known processes in which a platinum group metal or compound is employed together with a Lewis acid such as ferric chloride. In the prior art process, the platinum or platinum group compound is eluted out with the acid into the reaction mixture. Recovery is a cumbersome and expensive procedure.In contrast, according to the method of this invention, substntially no platinum group metal is eluted out into the reaction mixture and thus, the expensive platinum group catalyst components can easily be separated and recovered, for example, by filtration. The importance of this advantage in commercial practice will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. The use of a basic substance as an additional promoter markedly improves the yield and the selectivity of urethane compounds in accordance with the process of this invention. Any of a large selection of platinum group metals or compounds containing a platinum group element can be used in the process of the present invention. These include, for example, palladium, rhodium, platinum, ruthenium, iridium and osmium, metal blacks thereof and compounds containing these elements. These catalysts may be supported on any of a number of known carriers such as active carbon, graphite, silica, alumina, silica alumina, silica titania, titania, zirconia, barium sulfate, calcium carbonate, asbestos, bentonite, diatomaceous earth, polymers, ion exchange resins, zeolite, molecular sieve, magnesium silicate and magnesia. Metallic catalysts may be prepared by supporting compounds containing these metal ions on a carrier and reducing them with hydrogen or formaldehyde. Alloys and intermetallic compounds containing these metals may also be employed. These may include those between these platinum group metals or those containing other elements such as selenium, tellurium, sulfur, antimony, bismuth, copper, silver, gold, zinc, tin, vanadium, iron, cobalt, nickel, mercury, lead, thallium, chromium, molybdenum and tungsten. Exemplary compounds containing platinum group elements which may be employed include inorganic acid salts such as the halides, sulfates, nitrates, phosphates and borates organic acid salts such as the acetates, oxalates and formates cyanides hydroxides oxides, sulfides metal acid salts containing an anion such as a nitro group, a cyano group, a halogen atom and an oxalate ion metal complexes with salts or complexes containing ammonia, an amine, a phosphine and a carbon monoxide ligand and organometallic compounds having an organic ligand or an organic group.

In the case of the urethanation of a primary or secondary amine, the amount of the alcohol or phenol employed is typically at least one mol per amino group of the primary or secondary amine. In the case of the urethanation of a urea compound, the amount of the alcohol or phenol employed is at least two mols per urea group of the urea compound. In botn cases it is preferred that the alcohol or phenol is employed as a reaction medium. In such a case the amount of the alcohol or phenol is typically about 3 to 100 mols per amino group of the primary or secondary amine or per urea group of the urea compound. The carbon monoxide which can be employed as one starting material in this invention may be pure carbon monoxide or may contain other gases such as nitrogen, argon, helium, carbon dioxide, a hydrocarbon or a halogenated hydrocarbon. A small amount, i.e., less than about 10 by mol of hydrogen based on carbon monoxide does not affect adversely the urethanation using the catalyst system of this invention, and accordingly in this invention carbon monoxide containing such a small amount of nydrogen may be advantageously employed from the industrial viewpoint. The amount of carbon monoxide which can be employed is typically at least one mol, preferably about 2 to about 100 mols per amino group of the primary or secondary amine or per urea group of the urea compound. The oxidizing agent which can be used in this invention may be molecular oxygen or an organic nitro compound or a mixture thereof. Molecular oxygen is pre ferried. The molecular oxygen means pure oxygen or a gas containing oxygen such as air. The molecular oxygen may also be diluted by the addition of other gases not interfering with the reaction to air or pure oxygen including inert gases such as nitrogen, argon, helium and carbon dioxide. In some cases the molecular oxygen may also contain a gas such as hydrogen, carbon monoxide, a hydrocarbon and a halogenated hydrocarbon. The organic nitro compound which can be used in this invention may be either an alicyclic, aliphatic or aromatic nitro compound. Exemplary alicyclic nitro compounds include nitrocyclobutane, nitrocyclopentane, nitrocyclohexane, dinitrocyclohexane kespective isomers and bis nitrocyclohexyl methane.Exemplary aliphatic nitro compounds include nitromethane, nitroethane, nitropropane respective isomers , nitrobutane respective isomers , nitropentane respective isomers , nitrohexane respective isomers , nitrodecane respective isomers , 1,2 dinitroethane, dinitropropane respective isomers , dinitrobutane respective isomers , dinitropentane respective isomers , ainitrohexane respective isomers , dinitrodecane respec tive isomers , phenylnitromethane, bis nitromethyl cyclohexane and bis nitromethyl benzene.

When molecular oxygen is used as the oxidizing agent in the present invention, the urethanation of, for example, a primary amine proceeds according to the general reaction equation as follows EMI34.1 wherein R9 and R1 D eac represents an organic group and n represents the number of amino groups in one molecule of an amino compound. In the case of a secondary amine the urethanation proceeds substantially in the same way as described above. The urethanation of a urea compound proceeds according to the general reaction equation as follows EMI34.2 wherein R11, R12, R13 and R14 each represents a hydrogen atom, an aliphatic group, an ali cyclic group, an arylaliphatic group, a hetero cyclic group or an aromatic group and R10 re presents an organic group. The molecular oxygen may be less or more than its equivalent amount, but a mixture of oxygen and carbon monoxide or a mixture of oxygen and an organic hydroxyl compound should be used in the range outside the explosion limit. When an organic nitro compound is used as the oxidizing agent, the organic nitro compound also participates in the reaction to form a urethane compound. Accordingly, when the structure of the organic group in the organic nitro compound is different from that in the primary or secondary amine or the substituent in the urea compound, different kinds of urethane compounds are obtained corresponding to the respective structures. When both have the same structure, the same urethane compound is obtained.In this case, the urethanation of, for example, a primary amine proceeds according to the following reaction equation EMI35.1 wherein R9, R10, and n are the same as defined above, and R15 represents a residue of an organic nitro compound other than the nitro group and for simplicity the number of nitro groups in the organic nitro compound is assum ed to be the same as that of amino groups in the primary amine. In the case of the urethanation of a urea compound with, for example, an organic mononitro compound, the reaction proceeds as follows EMI35.2 R16NHCOOR10 2.H2O wherein R10 , R11 , R12 R 13 and R14 are the same as defined above, and R16 represents an organic residue of an organic nitro compound. When only an organic nitro compound is used as the oxidizing agent, the amount of the primary amine, secondary arnine or urea compound to the organic nitro compound may preferably be one mol of the nitro group per 2 mols of the amino group or the urea group. It is possib e to practice the invention at a ratio apart from the stoichiometric ratio but it is advantageous to adopt an equivalent ratio of the amino group or urea group to the nitro group of 1.1 1 to 4 1, preferably 1.5 1 to 2.5 . 1. When molecular oxygen or other oxidizing agents are employed at the same time, the organic nitro compound may be used in an amount less than the stoichiometric amount. In the process of this invention, it is preferred to use an excess of an organic hydroxyl compound as the reaction medium. If necessary, other solvents which do not affect the reaction adversely may also be used.Exemplary solvents which can be employed include aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene and mesitylene nitriles such as acetonitrile and benzonitrile sulfones such as sulforane, methylsulforane and dimethylsulforane, ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, 1,4dioxane and 1,2 dimethoxyethane ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone esters such as ethyl acetate and ethyl benzoate and amides such as N,N dimethylformamide, N,N dimethylacetamide, N methylpyrrolidone and hexamethyl phosphoramide. Further, it is also possible to lose, as a solvent, a halogenated aromatic hydrocarbon which is one kind of the organic halide to be used as the promoter in this invention such as chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene, trichlorobenzene, fluorobenzene, chlorotoluene, chloronaphthalene and bromonaphthalene a halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbon or a halogenated alicyclic hydrocarbon such as chlorohexane, chlorocyclohexane, trichlorotrifluoroethene, methylene chloride and carbon tetrachloride. The reaction according to this invention can hardly be affected adversely by the presence of a small amount of water. However, the presence of water might cause some side reactions such as the hydrolysis of urethane compounds and the water gas reaction of carbon monoxide and accordingly, it is possible to emplcy additives having a dehydrating action. Suitable examples of such additives include zeolites, orthoesters, ketals, acetals, enolethers and trialkyl orthoborates. In the process of this invention, the reaction is carried out at a temperature of from about 800C to about 3000C, preferably from 120 to 2200C. The reaction pressure is typically in the range of from about 1 Kg cm2 to about 500 g cm2, preferably from about 20 Xg cm2 to about 300 Kg cm2. The reaction time which may vary depending on the reaction system employed and other reaction conditions chosen is typically about one minute to about 10 hours. The reaction of this invention can be carried out either batch wise or continuously by removing continuously the reaction mixture from the reaction system while continuously feeding the reactants into the reaction system. A further understanding of the present invention, and the advantages thereof, can be had by reference to the following examples. The conversion of a primary or secondary amine, a urea compound, an organic nitro compound or molecular oxygen, the yield of a urethane compound, the selectivity of an urethane compound and the selectivity of molecular oxygen to the urethanation reaction were determined in the examples according to the following formulae Conversion of A Mol of A supplied Mol of remaining A x 100 Mol of A supplied or Mol of reacted A Mol of A supplied wherein A is a primary or secondary amine, a urea compound, an organic nitro compound or molecular oxygen.Yield of a urethane compound Mol of a urethane compound formed Mol of a primary or secondary amine supplied x 100 or Mol of a urethane compound formed x 1 x 100 Mol of a urea compound supplied X 2 in case of a syn urea compound employed as the starting material.Selectivity of a urethane compound Yield of a urethane compound x 100 Conversion of a primary or secondary amine or a urea compound Selectivity of molecular oxygen to the urethanation reaction Yield of a urethane compound Conversion of molecular oxygen x 100 The autoclave employed in the followir.g examples were internally lined with titanium or made of Hastelloy C Example 1 in a 140 ml stirring type autoclave were charged 40 mmols c aniline, 40 ml of ethanol, 0.5 mg atom of palladium black and 5 mmols of cesium iodide.After the air inside the autoclave had been replaced with carbon monoxide, carbon monoxide was pressurized into the autoclave to 80 Kg cm2 and then oxygen was pressurized into the autoclave to 6 Kg cm2, resulting in a total pressure of 86 Kg cmê The reaction was carried out at 160 C for one hour with stirring, and subsequently the reaction mixture obtained was subjected to filtration.

One gram of the iodine containing anion exchange resin, 40 mmols of aniline, 40 ml of ethanol and 0.5 mg atom of palladium black were charged into a 140 ml stirring type autoclave. After the air inside the autoclave was replaced with carbon monoxide, carbon monoxide was pressurized into the autoclave to 80 Kg cm2, and subsequently oxygen was pressurized into the autoclave to 6Kg cm2, resulting in a total pressure of 86 Kg cm2. The reaction was carried out with stirring at 1500C for one hour, and then the reaction mixture was subjected to filtration.As the result of analysis of the filtrate, the conversion of aniline was 83 and the yield of ethylN phenylcarbamate was 81 with a selectivity of 98 . When the above described procedure was repeated by using the palladium black and the anion exchange resin separated by filtration as such, the result obtained was as good as the above, i.e., the conversion of aniline was 82 al,a the yield of ethyl N phenylcarbamate was 80 with a selectivity of 98 . The reaction solution obtained in either case was yellowish and when the reaction solution was distilled under reduced pressure, yellow crystals were precipitated.

As a result, the conversion of aniline was 85 and the yield of ethyl N phenylcarbamate was 82 with a selectivity of 97 .In the filtrate obtained no palladium was detected. The selectivity of the oxygen reacted to the urethanation was 93 . When the above described procedure was repeated except that the rubidium was not employed, the conversion of aniline was 45 and the yield of ethyl N phenylcarbamate was 41 with a selectivity of 91 , and the selectivity of the oxygen to the urethanation was 70 . The reaction solution obtained in either case was transparent and yellowish. It is clear from this example that a urethane compound can be obtained at a high selectivity using only an organic halide and palladium, and the yield and the selectivity can be remarkably increaseS by additional use of a basic substance. Example 7 The procedure of Example 1 was repeated except that 1 mmol of iodine and 1 mmol of triethylamine were employed instead of the cesium iodide. As a result, the conversion of aniline was 90 and the yield of ethyl Nphenylcarbamate was 86 E with a selectivity of 96 . In the filtrate no palladium was detected. When the above described procedure was repeated except that the triethylamine was not employed, the conversion of aniline was 42 and the yield of ethyl Nphenylcarbamate was 28 with a selectivity of 67 t. Comparative Example 1 The procedure of Example 1 was repeated except that the cesium iodide was not employed. As a result, the conversion of aniline was 8 and the yield of ethylN phenylcarbamate was only 1.9 . Comparative Example 2 The procedure of Example 1 was repeated except that 1 mmol of triethylamine was employed instead of the cesium iodide. As a result, the conversion of aniline was 3 and the yield of ethyl N phenylcarbamate was only 1 .
