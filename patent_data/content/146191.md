# Alternately heatable and coolable moulding block.

## Abstract
An alternately heatable and coolable moulding block for manufacuring plate shaped information carriers from thermoplastic material, which block is composed of a plate of an electrically insulating material which has a thin metal mould containing the information and in which plate a duct for a cooling liquid is provided and of an electrical conduc tor wound to form a flat induction coil. Between the mould and the insulating plate, there are provided a layer of a ma terial of good thermal conductivity, which layer is in contact with the mould, and a layer of a ferromagnetic material.
