# Process for the preparation of a phenylalkylaminoethylsalicylamide.

## Abstract
There are disclosed a process for producing 5 R 1 hydroxy 2 R 1 methyl 3 phenylpropyl aminoethyl salicyl amide and its acid addition salts in high yields which does not require chromatography, and important intermediates in this process. The process is stereoselective for the desired R,R amine a preferred embodiment includes the steps of 1 reaction of an N R protected R 1 methyl 3 phenyl propylamine with a 4 O protected 2 bromo 3 carbamoyl acetophenone to produce the corresponding R,R glycyl benzamide, 2 reduction to produce a mixture of S,R,R R,R,R hydroxybenzamides, 3 removal of the protect ing groups, 4 resolution of the deprotected product and, if desired, conversion to the free R,R amine or to another salt. In this process, the selection of particular N protecting groups has a very favourable effect, especialy in steps 2 and 3 .
