## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTION 2 Aryl 1,2 Benzisothiazolinone l,l Dioxides and Pharmaceutical Compositions containing themABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE The invention concerns novel 2 aryl 1,2benzisothiazolinone l,l dioxide compounds methods for their preparation pharmaceutical compositions containing them as an active ingredient and methods of inhibiting proteases, especially elastase, and of treating emphysema, rheumatoid arthritis, and various inflammatory diseases, for example, bronchial inflammation.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention The present invention relates to novel 2 aryl 1,2 benzispthiazolinone l,l dioxide compounds and methods of selectively inhibiting proteases especially elastase, and of treating emphysema and rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases using the novel compounds. Description of the Prior Art Various 2 aryl 1,2 benzisothiazolinone l,ldioxide compounds have been prepared in the past. Louis L, Bambas, Chemistry of Heterocyclic Compounds, Vol. 4, pp. 330 339, Interscience Publishers 1952 , discloses 2phenyl , 2 4 nitrophenyl , 2 phenylsulfonyl , 2 2 chlorocyclohexylj , and 2 2 ,3 , and 4 tolyl 1,2 benzisothiazolinone l,l dioxide. However, none of these 2 aryl 1,2 benzi sothiazolinone 1,l dioxide compounds is the same as the compounds of the present invention, and they do not have and would not suggest the activity of the compounds of the present invention in methods of selectively inhibiting proteases, especially elastase, and of treating emphysema, rheumatoid arthritis, and other inflammatory diseases. R. Fischer and H. Hurni, in On Benzisothiazolones A Series with a Wide Range of Bacteriostatic and Fungistatic Activity , Arzneimittel Forschung, 14 12 1301 1964 , disclose a large number of benzisothiazolones. However, none of these benzisothiazolones are l,l dioxide compounds, and they are thus not the same as the compounds of the present invention. Moreover, they do not have and would not suggest the activity of the compounds of the present invention in methods of selectively inhibiting proteases, especially elastase, and of treating emphysema, rheumatoid arthritis, and other inflammatory diseases. German Offenlegungsschrift 26 36. 599 discloses certain acyl saccharins and methods of inhibiting elastase and treating emphysema with such compounds.However, those acyl saccharin compounds are not the same as the compounds of the present invention, and it is unexpected that the compounds of the present invention are more stable compounds and provide a greater degree of specificity of protease inhibition activity, which is therapeutically valuable.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Possibly a number of different proteases, or proteolytic enzymes, are involved in the initiation and perpetuation of the connective tissue destruction which occurs during the typical inflammatory response of various animals, including humans. The proteases are an important family of enzymes within the proteolytic enzyme group whose members are essential to a variety of biological activities, such as digestion, formation and dissolution of blood clots, the immune reaction to foreign cells and organisms, and the fertilization of the ovum by the spermatozoon. The proteolytic or protein cutting enzymes are proteins whose function is to alter or decompose other proteins by splitting them into fragments. Elastase is one of the proteases and it acts on bonds in the middle of the protein chain which are adjacent to aliphatic amino acids. Elastase is of particular interest because it has the broadest spectrum of activity against natural substrates. In particular, the elastase of the granulocyte is important because granulocytes participate in acute inflammation and in acute exacerbation of chronic forms of inflammation, which characterizes many clinically important inflammatory diseases. Granulocyte elastase can attack elastin, proteoglycan, and collagen of connective tissue, activate C5 to release C5a, a potent chemotactic factor, and generate Kinin from Kininogen. Also, an elastase has been reported to be a significant secretory product of activated macrophages, a cell type predominating in the chronic phase of inflammation. Proteases may be inactivated by inhibitors which block the active site of the enzyme by binding tightly thereto. Naturally occurring protease inhibitors form part of the control or defense mechanisms that are crucial to the well being of the organism, as the protease enzymes would destroy any protein within reach, including themselves. The naturally occurring enzyme inhibitors have evolved a configuration in the binding region that closely resembles the bound substrate, which is part of the reason they bind to the enzyme so tightly Stroud, A Family of Protein CuttingProteins Sci. Am. July 1974, pp. 74 88 . Q1 Antitrypsin, a glycoprotein in human serum, has a wide inhibitory spectrum covering trypsin, chymotrypsin, plasmin, kallikrein, elastase, and thrombin. The marked reduction in serum al antitrypsin has been associated with pulmonary emphysema Erickson, S. Pulmonary emphysema and alphal antitrypsin deficiency Acta. Med. Scand. 1964, 175, 197 . Subsequent studies have confirmed and extended this observation Morse et al. A Community Study of theRelation of Alphal Antitrypsin Levels to Obstructive LungDiseases The New England Journal of Medicine, Vol. 292, No.6, p. 278, February 6, 1975 . Emphysema has been experimentally induced in laboratory animals by aerosolization into the tracheobronchial tree of the proteolytic enzyme, papain, and more recently by dog polymorphonuclear enriched leukocyte homogenates Mass et al. Induction of Experimental Emphysema American Review of Respiratory Disease,Vol. 106, p. 384, 1972 . The pathological changes are similar to and closely resemble human pulmonary emphysema.Also, intratracheally instilled elastase produces marked alterations in lung elastin with dilatation of alveolar ducts and alveoli Johanson et al. Comparison of elastase, collagenase and papain on lung structure and function Amer. Rev. Resp. Dis. 1971, 103, 908 . Papain induced emphysema has been inhibited in the hamster by human alantitrypsin HAAT . Since papain is one of the few proteinases not inhibited by HAAT, it has been found that theHAAT works by inhibiting the elastase like enzymes released by polymorphonuclear PMN leukocytes and alveolar macrophages which invade the hamsters lungs following exposure Martorana et al. Inhibition of Papain Induced Emphysema in the Hamster by Human Alphal Antitrypsin, Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. Vol. 52, No. 3, pp. 758 759, 1974, and Kaplan et nThe induction of emphysema with elastase 1 Journal of Laboratory and Clinical Medicine, Vol. 82, No. 3, 349356, Sept. 1973 . Elastase inhibitors may be used in control of elastase like enzymes released by polymorpho nuclear PMN leukocytes and alveolar macrophages in emphysema. In rheumatoid arthritis, antigen antibody complexes have been demonstrated in the synovial fluid and as cytoplasmic inclusions in leukocytes which are chemotactically attracted to the sites of inflammation Oronsky et al. Release of Cartilage Mucopolysaccharide Degrading Neutral Protease from Human Leukocytes , Journal of Experimental Medicine, Vol. 138, pp. 461 472, 1973 . Polymorphonuclear leukocytes PMN enter acute inflammatory exudates to phagocytize the immune reactants or microorganisms. During phagocytosis,PMN enzymes are sometimes released extracellularly.When the extracellular release occurs to a degree sufficient to overwhelm the host inhibitors, tissue damage produced by the PMN substances may greatly diminish their beneficial effects. The major portion of neutral proteolylic activity in humans is usually attributed to elastin like enzymes Janoff, Alanine p nitrophenyl esterase activity of human leukocyte granules , Biochemical Journal, 114 pp. 157 159, 1969 . Accordingly, protease, especially elastase, inhibitors can be used to control tissue damage and undesirable conditions such as edema which occur during the course of various inflammatory diseases and conditions, whether those diseases and conditions are, or are not, of immunological origin. The tissue damage and undesirable conditions are mediated by certain cells at the sites of inflammation which release the proteases, especially elastase, which are the proximate causative agents of the tissue damage and undesirable conditions.Thus, protease, especially elastase, inhibitors are useful in treating emphysema, rheumatoid arthritis, and various inflammatory diseases, for example, bronchial inflammat on. However, an important improvement obtained with the novel 2 aryl 1,2 benzisothiazolinone l,1 dioxide compounds of the present invention is the selective, or specific, inhibition of certain proteases and elastases, while other proteases and elastases remain virtually unaffected, Particularly, the novel inhibitors of the present invention show excellent inhibition of human PMN polymorphonuclear leukocyte elastase and bovine chymotrypsin, while exhibiting almost no inhibition of porcine pancreatic elastase, bovine trypsin, and, in most cases, human PMN cathepsin G, as will be shown in more detail below. The use of animal proteases and elastases in studying inhibitors, as predictive of activity with human proteases and elastases, is well accepted because of the high degree of homology and similarity of amino acid compositions among the structures involved Methods in Enzymology, Vol. XIX,Academic Press, 1970 . The ability of the novel inhibitors of the present invention to inhibit PMN polymorphonuclear leukocyte elastase while not inhibiting trypsin, for example, is therapeutically valuable. The role of PMN elastase in the destructive phases of emphysema, rheumatoid arthritis, and other inflammatory diseases and conditions has already been described in detail above. Trypsin, on the other hand, is part of an important class of prptein processing hydrolases with various essential roles in human metabolism, whose normal functioning it is desirable not to inhibit Shaw, Synthetic Protease Inhibitors Acting by AffinityLabeling , Proteases and Biological Control, Cold SpringHarbor Laboratory, pp. 455 465, at 459, 1975 .Moreover, it is well understood that among the desirable properties of a synthetic inhibitor is specificity for one or a small number of proteases Powers et al., Synthetic Inhibitors of Granulocyte Elastase and Cathepsin G , NeutralProteases cf u.t.an Polymorphonuclear Leukocytes, pp. 221 233, 1978 Cohen, Report of the Working Group for Evaluation of Elastase Inhibitor Replacement Therapy in PulmonaryEmphysema, pp. 8 9, October 17 18, 1978, Bethesda Maryland Larsen and Shaw, Active Site Directed Alkylation ofChymotrypsin by Reagents Utilizing Various DepartingGroups , Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, Vol. 19, No. 11, pp. 1284 1286, 1976 Wong and Shaw, Inactivation ofTrypsin like Proteases by Active Site Directed Sulfonylation , Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics, 176, pp.113 118, 1976 Abeles and Maycock, Suicide Enzyme Inactivators , Accounts of Chemical Research, Vol. 9, No. 9, 1976 Kettner and Shaw, Synthesis of Peptides of ArginineChloromethyl Ketone , Biochemistry, Vol. 17, No. 22, pp. 4778 4783, 1978 Aoyagi, Structure and Activities ofProteinase Inhibitors of Microbial Origin , BioactivePeptides Produced by Microorganisms, Chapter 7, pp. 129140, Halstead Press, 1978 and Kuhn and Senior, Lung,Vol. 155, p. 191, 1978 .SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It has been found that certain novel 2 aryl 1,2 benzisothiazolinone l,l dioxide compounds are useful in methods of inhibiting proteases, especially elastase, and of treating emphysema rheumatoid arthritis, and other inflammatory diseases. These methods comprise the administration of a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the formula EMI7.1 wherein R is EMI8.1 where n is 1 to 5 and X is independently selected from 1 fluoro 2 nitro, except that where X is only nitro, n must be 2 and X must be 2,4 or 3, 5 dinitro 3 trifluoromethyl 4 cyano 5 C13 alkoxycarbonyl 6 C13 alkylcarbonyl 7 carboxyl 8 carbamoyl 9 C13 alkylacylamino 10 C13 alkylsulfonyl 11 N,N di Cl 3 alkyl sulfamyl 12 trifluoromethoxy 13 trifluoromethylthio and 14 trifluoromethylsulfonyl and 15 trifluoromethylsulfinyl orEMI8.2 where m has the same meaning as n above, and Y has the same meaning as X, except that it may additionally be mono nitro. In a preferred embodiment, n is 1 or 2 andY is nitro or cyano. In a more preferred embodiment, n is 2 andX is nitro, trifluoromethyl, or cyano and n is 5 andX is fluoro. Representative compounds of the present invention which inhibit proteases, especially elastase, and therefore are useful for treating emphysema, rheumatoid arthritis, and other inflammatory diseases are the following novel compounds 2 2,4 dinitrophenyl 1,2benzisothiazolinone 1, 1dioxide 2 2,3,4,5,6 pentafluoropheyl 1,2 benzisothiazolinone l,l dioxide 2 2 nitro 4 trifluoromethylphenyl 1,2benzisothiazolinone l,l dioxide 2 2 cyano 4 nitrophenyl 1,2 benzisothiazolinone l,l dioxide 2 4 nitro 5 trifluoromethylphenyl 1,2 benzisothiazolinone l,l dioxide 2 2, 4dicyanophenyl l , 2 benzisothiazolinone l,l dioxide 2 3,5 dinitrophenyl 1,2 benzisothiazolinone 1, l dioxide 2 3 nitropyrid 2 yl 1,2 benzisothiazolinone 1, l dioxide 2 5 nitropyrid 2 yl 1, 2 benzisothiazolinone l,l dioxide 2 5 cyanopyrid 2 yl 1,2 benzisothiazolinone 1, l dioxide 2 3,5 dinitropyrid 2 yl 1,2 benzisothiazolinone 1,1 dioxide The present invention is also concerned with novel methods of inhibiting proteases, especially elastase, and of treating emphysema, rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases which comprise administering to a patient in need of such treatment a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I. The present invention is still further concerned with novel pharmaceutical compositions comprising a nontoxic pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and a compound of Formula I. The inhibition of proteases, especially elastase, and the treatment of emphysema, rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases in accordance with the methods of the present invention is accomplished by orally, rectally, parenterally, or topically administering to patients the compounds of Formula I, or mixtures thereof, in a nontoxic pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The non toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carrier may be, for example, either a solid or a liquid.Exemplary of solid carriers are lactose, corn starch, gelatin, talc, stearic acid, magnesium stearate, terra alba, sucrose, agar, pectin and acacia. Exemplary of liquid carriers are peanut oil, olive oil, sesame oil and water. Similarly, the carrier or diluent may include a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate, alone, or with a wax. Different pharmaceutical forms of the therapeutically useful compositions of the present invention may be utilized for administration. For example, if a solid carrier is used, the compositions may take the form of tablets, capsules, powders, troches or lozenges, prepared by standard pharmaceutical techniques. If a liquid carrier is used, the preparation may be in the form of a soft gelatin capsule, a syrup, a liquid solution, a liquid emulsion, or a liquid suspension, or a liquid which may be sprayed by aerosol or nebulizer. Suppositories may be prepared in the conventional manner by mixing the compounds of Formula I with a suitable non irritating excipient which is solid at room temperature. Exemplary of such excipients are cocoa butter and polyethylene glycol. Gels, lotions and aerosol sprays for topical application may be prepared in conventional manner. The active compounds are administered in a therapeutically effective amount sufficient to inhibit proteases, especially elastase. The treatment of emphysema is one condition where the inhibition of elastase will arrest the condition, and accordingly the amount of active compound necessary to inhibit elastase is the amount required to treat emphysema.Advantageously, the active compounds will be administered, alone or in a pharmaceutical composition, in an amount of from about 1.0 mg. to 100 mg. per kilogram of body weight per day 50 mg. to 5.0 g. per patient per day of the active compound, preferably from about 1.5 mg. to 15 mg. per kilogram of body weight per day. The daily dosage may be given in either single or multiple dosages. The methods of treatment of the present invention comprise administering to a patient human or animal a compound of Formula I admixed with a non toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carrier such as exemplified above. It should be understood that although preferred dosage ranges are given, the dosage level for any particular patient depends upon the activity of the specific compound employed. Also, many other factors that modify the actions of drugs will be taken into account by those skilled in the art of therapeutic use of medicinal agents, for example, body weight, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, reaction sensitivities, and severity of the particular disease. The present invention is also concerned with novel compounds of the formula EMI11.1 where R has the same meaning as above. Preferred compounds are those wherein n is 1 or 2 and Y is nitro or cyano. More preferred compounds are those wherein n is 2 and X is nitro, trifluoromethyl, or cyano, and wherein n is 5 and X is fluoro. The present invention is still further concerned with a method of preparing the novel compounds of Formula T hy carrying out a series of reactions which may be represented by the following equations EMI12.1 where R has the same meaning as above, and Hal is chloro, bromo, or iodo, preferably chloro. In the first reaction step, 2,2 dithiodibenzoic acid di sulfide is treated with an agent for producing an acid chloride, such as thionylchloride. Other agents which may be employed include a phosphorous trihalide, a phosphorous pentahalide, a phosphorous oxytrihalide, and phosgene. Preferably, a thionyl halide is used, either by itself or in an inert solvent. The inert solvent may be a hydrocarbon such as toluene, xylene, and especially benzene. The mixture of 2,2 dithiodibenzoic acid and thionylchloride is refluxed with stirring until the reaction is essentially complete. In the second reaction step, halogenation may be carried out in an inert solvent which may be selected from chlorinated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride, chloroform and carbon tetrachloride, or hydrocarbons such as benzene. The halogenating agent may be N chlorosuccinimide, N bromosuccinimide, an organic hypohalite such as t butyl hypochlorite, liquid bromine, or preferably chlorine gas. The halogenation may be carried out at a temperature of from about OOC. to 1000C., preferably at ambient temperatures. The time of reaction is not critical and the reaction is preferably carried out until it is essentially complete. The pressure is not critical and the halogenation is generally carried out at atmospheric pressure in an open system.The 2halothiobenzoyl halide which is produced may be recovered in a conventional manner, such as by crystallization and filtration. In the third reaction step the 2 halothiobenzoyl halide is reacted with a compound of the formula R NH2 where R is as defined above. The reaction between these compounds, an intermolecular cyclization, may be carried out in an aprotic solvent which may be a hydrocarbon such as benzene, an ether such as diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran, an amide such as dimethylformamide, or a halogenated hydrocarbon such as methylene chloride, chloroform, or carbon tetrachloride. The reaction may be carried out in the presence of a mild base, which may be an alkali metal carbonate such as sodium carbonate, an alkaline earth metal carbonate such as calcium carbonate, an alkali metal bicarbonate such as sodium bicarbonate, an alkaline earth metal bicarbonate such as calcium bicarbonate, a tertiary amine such as triethylamine, or a pyridine. The mild bases which are liquids at ambient temperatures may also be used in excess as the solvent. The reaction may be carried out between 0 and 1500C., preferably at ambient temperatures. The time of reaction is not critical and the reaction is preferably carried out until it is esseiitlaw y complete. The pressure is not critical and the reaction is generally carried out at atmospheric pressure in an open system. The 2 aryl l,2 benzisothia zolinone which is produced may be recovered in a conventional manner, such as by crystallization and filtration. In the fourth and final reaction step the 2 aryl 1,2 benzisothiazolinone is oxidized to produce the compounds of Formula I. This oxidation may be accomplished with an appropriate oxidizing agent such as hydrogen peroxide or potassium permanganate, and is carried out in any alkanoic acid solvent, from ambient temperature to 1200C. The following examples will serve to illustrate the manner in which the compounds and compositions of the present invention may be prepared. All parts are given in parts by weight unless otherwise expressed.

Another method of preparing the 2 aryl 1,2benzisothiazolinone l,l dioxide compounds of the present invention which may be employed comprises the steps of 1 reacting an appropriately substituted aniline with o sulfobenzoic acid cyclic anhydride and 2 heating the product of step 1 in polyphosphoric acid at a temperature of from 1800 220 C. to give the desired product. These reactions are illustrated in the following scheme EMI19.1 where R has the same meaning as described further above. Yet another method of preparing the 2 aryl l, 2 benzisothiazolinone l,l dioxide compounds of the present invention comprises the steps of 1 heating an appropriately substituted aniline with o sulfobenzoic cyclic anhydride in the presence of phosphorus oxychloride and 2 refluxing the product of step 1 in hydrochloric acid to give the desired product. These reactions are illustrated in the following scheme EMI20.1 The following examples will serve to illustrate the manner in which the above methods of preparation may be carried out. EXAMPLE 24 2 2,3,4,5, 6 pentafluorophenyl 1, 2 benzisothiazolinone l,l dioxide To a solution of 10g. 0.054 mole of osulfobenzoic acid cyclic anhydride in 75 ml. of warm dioxane was added 10g. 0.054 mole of 2,3,4,5,6pentafluoroaniline. A precipitate immediately appeared.After warming on a steam bath for 15 hrs., the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and the precipitate was then washed with ether to give 14g. 75t yield of the salt. A mixture of 3G. of the salt and 15 ml. of polyphosphoric acid was immersed in a silicone bath heated at 2000C. After 7 min. the solution was cooled slightly and diluted with 50 ml. of water. The precipitate was removed by filtration. After several runs of this size the combined precipitate weighed 3.0g. 16 yield . This was recrystallized from 40 ml. of acetone by the slow addition of about 7 ml. of water. Total yield was 15 2.8g. , and the product m.p. was 168 1690C. EXAMPLE 25 2 4 fluorophenyl 1,2 benzisothiazolinone 1,1 dioxideA. N 2 4 fluorophenyl l,2 benzisothiazol 3 2H ylidene benzenamine S,S dioxide To a suspension of 5.52g. 0.03 mole of osulfobenzoic cyclic anhydride in 35 ml. of phosphorus oxychloride is added, in portions, 6.73g. 0.06 mole of p fluoroaniline over 5 min. The reaction gets warm and a clear solution results. This solution is heated under reflux for 2 hrs. and then the excess phosphorus oxychloride is removed in vacuo. The thick residue is stirred with 150 ml. of ice water until a filterable solid is formed. Filtration separates the solid which is then dissolved in 75 ml. of chloroform and diluted with ether to the cloud point.The solution is filtered through diatomaceous earth, after which petroleum ether is added to the filtrate, which causes crystallization of the final product.B. 2 4 fluorophenyl l,2 benzisothiazolinone l,l dioxide A mixture of 1.5g. of the compound prepared inStep A. above is stirred and heated under reflux with 60 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid for 2.5 hrs.A solid is always found to be present.
