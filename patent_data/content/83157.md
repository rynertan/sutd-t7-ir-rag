## Description
FLEXIBLE FILM LAMINATES The present invention relates to flexible film laminates for use in food pouches and tubes. In recent years, the food packaging industry has shown intense interest in the concept of pouch packed foods which, among other advantages, do not require freezing for their preservation and can therefore dispense with costly and energy intensive refrigerated transportation and storage facilities. Much effort has gone into the development of a flexible food pouch which not only can withstand the rigors of sterilization and later reheating, e.g., microwave heating, and provide various properties which are sufficient to adequately protect the contents during storage, but which also employ materials which are toxicologically safe. Certain packaging applications require that the packaging material constitutes a good barrier to the passage of oxygen. For example, the packaging of certain foods requires that a minimum of oxygen or air is transmitted to the contents. Cheese is one food product which should be packaged to the exclusion of oxygen. Oriented polyacrylonitrile PAN film has excellent oxygen barrier properties. One shortcoming, however, is that it is not heat sealable to itself. Because of this, joining of two PAN layers requires the imposition of an adhesive between the PAN layers which will act as an adherent bridge between the slayers. A further shortcoming of oriented polyacrylonitrile film is its relatively poor moisture barrier properties which is a particular problem in retortable food packaging. This deficiency can be overcome by applying to one surface of the PAN a layer of a thermoplastic material having good moisture barrier properties. The thermoplastic material can also provide a heat sealable coating on the PAN film.However, because of the significant chemical dissimilarity between PAN and thermoplastic moisture barrier polymers, such as polyolefins, adhesion between the two materials is poor and package integrity suffers. It is necessary, therefore, to impose an adhesive between thePAN and the thermoplastic moisture barrier which will act as a mutually adherent bridge between the two materials. It has been found, however, that materials which exhibit good adhesion to PAN do not in general exhibit good adhesion to materials such as a polyolefin film. U.S. Patent No. 3,453,173 describes a polyolefinpolyacrylonitrile laminate, which is said to possess superior heat seal strength and excellent barrier properties to the transmission of gases and is adaptable for the construction of food containers. The laminate is prepared by bringing the polyolefin surface and the polyacrylonitrile surface together and securing the surfaces together using an adhesive such as the ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers disclosed inU.S. Patent No. 2,200,429. Either or both surfaces can be pre treated in some manner in an effort to make them more adherent, e.g., by treatment with a gaseous mixture of boron trifluoride, as described inBritish Patent No. 834,196 by flame treatment or by treatment by corona discharge as described in U.S. Patent No. 2,632,921.However, because the conditions of preparation and the adhesives contemplated are not conducive to the formation of primary valence bonding, the interlaminar adhesion in boiling water would not be expected to be strong. It is also known to metallize a PAN film in order to employ the metal layer as an effective surface through which adhesion can be accomplished to a water vapor barrier film In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a flexible film laminate comprising a a first layer of a polyacrylonitrile homopolymer film b a second layer joined at one surface to the first layer and composed of i a polyacrylonitrile homopolymer film or ii a heat sealable polyolefin film contacted at said one surface by an adhesive in the form of a maleic acid anhydride adduct of an ethylene propylene copolymer and c an adhesive third layer joining said first and second layers, the adhesive of the third layer being a combination of a styrene butadiene block copolymer and a random terpolymer of from 30 to 40 parts by weight of 1,3 pentadiene 30 to 40 parts by weight of a monocyclic terpene and from 25 to 35 parts by weight of alphamethylstyrene, said combination consisting of from 1 to 3 parts by weight of the block copolymer to from 3 to 1 parts by weight of the terpolymer said first and second layers being bonded together by way of the adhesive s and the laminate having been subjected to ultraviolet radiation through the first layer during bonding. The homopolymer polyacrylonitrile tPANi film used as the first layer and optionally also as the second layer of the laminate of the invention is a known material and can be prepared by the polymerization and film formation methods described in U.S. Patent No. 4,066,731. It preferably has an oxygen permeability rate of less than about 10 cc 100 in.2 645 cm2 24 hr. atm. at 1000F 380c , more preferably less than 0.1 cc 100 in.2 645 cm2 24 hr. atm. at about 730F 230C , and a water vapor transmission rate preferably less than about 50 9 100 in.2 645 cm2 24 hr. at 1000F 380C and 98 relative humidity, 2 more preferably less than about 10 9 100 in.2 645 cm2 24 hr. at 1000F 38or . The aforesaid oxygen and water vapor transmission rates can be determined by various methods known in the art. For example, oxygen transmission rates can conveniently be measured with a DohrmannPolymeric Permeation Analyzer PPA 1 Dohrmann Envirotech Corp.,Mountain View, California . The Dow cell can also be employed for this purpose in accordance with ASTM Dl434. The polyolefins which are useful herein as the second laminate layer include the film forming homopolymers and copolymers formed by the polymerization of one or more C2 C8 alpha olefins, for example, ethylene, propylene, butene l, pentene l, hexene l, heptene l and octene l. The useful polyolefins also include film forming copolymers of one or more of the aforesaid alpha olefins copolymerized with up to 20 weight percent total, and preferably not more than 5 weight percent total, of one or more other monomers copolymerizable with the alpha olefin, for example, carbon monoxide sulfur dioxide acrylic acid or an acrylate ester such as methyl acrylate, amyl acrylate, hexyl acrylate, and cyclohexyl acrylate methacrylic acid or a methacrylate ester, such as methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, propyl methacrylate, butyl methacrylate and amyl methacrylate vinyl acetic acid or a vinyl ester such as vinyl formate, vinyl acetate, vinyl propionate, vinyl butyrate, vinyl benzoate and isopropenyl acetate. The polyolefins can be atactic, isotactic, syndiotactic, crystalline or amorphous or a iti of any of the fe ng. The preferred polyolefin films are the homopolymers and the copolymers of ethylene and propylene. A particularly preferred polyolefin film is a random copolymer of propylene with a minor amount of ethylene commercially available from Exxon Corporation as EX 24 . Good adhesion can be obtained without subjecting the films to a surface treatment but, where the second layer is a polyolefin film, better adhesion is obtained by subjecting the polyolefin film to corona discharge and or by other equivalent means. Among all the adhesives which have been studied for use when the second film layer is a polyolefin, one particular adhesive has been discovered to be effective as part of the bonding system between the heat sealable polyolefin layer and the PAN layer. This material is a maleic acid anhydride adduct of an ethylene propylene copolymer. One such material which is commercially available as Morprime 78LJ10 Morton Chemical, Division of Morton Norwich Products, Inc. has been found to be particularly effective. In addition, this material has been cleared for use in food packaging by the Food and DrugAdministration of the U.S Government. As indicated above, the prior art laminate disclosed in U.S.Patent No. 3,453,173 possesses properties which tend to make it a particularly worthwhile candidate for use in the construction of a food pouch. However, it has been observed that no, or at most very little, bonding of the polyolefin layer to the PAN layer is obtained if the sole adhesive is the aforementioned Morprime 78LJ10. This adhesive is an effective adhesive to the polyolefin but not the PAN film. The adhesive third layer not only must be an effective adhesive to the PAN film, but where the second layer is a polyolefin film, it also must be an effective bonding system to the maleic anhydride ethylene propylene copolymer adhesive applied to the polyolefin film. The third layer adhesive is actually a combination of two materials, the first of which is a styrene butadiene block copolymer and the other is a random terpolymer of 1,3 pentadiene a monocyclic terpene and alpha methylstyrene. This combination consists of from 1 to 3 parts by weight of the block copolymer and from 3 to 1 parts by weight of the terpcly. ner. The first terial of this combination is commercially available under the name Kraton 1000 SeriesProducts Shell Chemical Co., Polymers Division .One material Kraton 1102, styrene butadiene block copolymer has the following properties determined at about 230C on films cast from a toluene solution tensile strength, psi 4600 31716 kPa 300S Modulous, psi 400 2758 kPa Elongation percent, 880 hardness, shore A 62 Angle TearStrength Die C, pli 190 Specific Gravity 0.94 and Solution Viscosity 25S w, cps from a toluene solution, 1200. The second component of the third layer adhesive combination is a resinous random terpolymer which contains from 30 to 40 parts by weight of 1,3 pentadiene 30 to 40 parts by weight of a monocyclic terpene and 25 to 35 parts by weight of alpha methylstyrene. A preferred monocyclic terpene is beta phellandrene, although other monocyclic terpenes, or mixtures thereof, may be employed, such as dipentene, alpha terpinene, beta terpinene, alpha phellandrene, gamma terpinene, terpinolene, sylvestrene, origanene and the pyronenes. It is preferred that the terpolymer additive exhibits the following properties melting point range ring and ball 75 1250C specific gravity 1.08 0.90 bromine number 6 14 iodine number 79 acid value, less than 1 soponification number, less than 1 decomposition temperature in air 3000C color in 50 toluene solution Gardner 6 and viscosity in toluene 70 . A particularly preferred random terpolymer is prepared by polymerizing a feed stream containing 37.5 by weight 1,3 pentadiene, 37.5 beta phellandrene and 25 by weight of alpha methylstyrene in a toluene diluent in the presence of an aluminum chloride catalyst. The resulting terpolymer contains 34 0 parts by weight of 1,3 pentadiene, 36.5 parts by weight of beta phellandrene and 29.5 parts by weight of alpha methylstyrene. This material has a molecular weight weight average of 1880, a bromine number of 14, an iodine number 79, a glass transition temperature of 38or, a viscosity toluene f to g of 70 and a decomposition temperature in air of 3000C. The individual films comprising the laminate described herein can be prepared in widely varying thicknesses, for example, from 0.1 mils 0.003 mm to 10 mils 0.3 mm , and preferably from O.S mil 0.013 mm to 5 mils 0.13 mm . The film laminate can be prepared in any manner which will result in effectively forming the adhesive bond. For example, where the second film layer is polyacrylonitrile, the combination adhesive, i.e., a styrene butadiene block copolymer mixed with the random terpolymer, can be deposited from a suitable solution, e.g., a toluene solution onto one of the PAN layers. After drying, the adhesive coated film can then be laminated to the other PAN film. Where the second film layer is a polyolefin, the maleic acid anhydride adduct of ethylene propylene copolymer can be applied to the polyolefin film from a dispersion of the adhesive in a high boiling aliphatic hydrocarbon.Following this, the combination adhesive, styrene butadiene block copolymer mixed with the random terpolymer can be deposited on the PAN film from a suitable solution, e.g., a toluene solution. The two adhesive coated films can then be laminated together with the individual adhesive layers in face to face relationship. In both cases interfacial lamination can be facilitated by the use of pressure and or heat. Where the second film layer is a polyolefin, it is also possible to apply the adhesive combination of the styrene butadiene block copolymer and the random terpolymer to the PAN and thereafter apply the maleic acid anhydride adduct of ethylene propylene copolymer to this adhesive layer. After appropriate drying the polyolefin layer can be laminated by any suitable means to this adhesive arrangement. After the various layers have been laminated together an effective bond between the layers is accomplished by irradiating the layers through the PAN film with an appropriate amount of ultraviolet W radiation. Techniques for irradiating these films are well known to those skilled in the art. The degree of ultraviolet radiation should be such that it will produce a bond of greater strength between the layers than in the absence of said radiation. Typical sources for the W radiation are a one kilowatt, high pressure, water cooled, mercury vapor lamp, or a 140 watt Hanovia LW lamp, type 30600. The distance from the radiation source to the film will generally depend upon the ultraviolet radiation source but generally will be from 1 to 10 inches 2.5 to 25 cm and preferably from 1 1 2 to about 5 inches 3.8 to 13 cm . EXAMPLE 1 A strip of corona treated, three mil 0.08 mm thick film, of a random copolymer of propylene, with a minor amount of ethylene commercially available from Exxon Corporation as EX 24 was coated with a 15 weight percent dispersion of a maleic acid anhydride adduct of an ethylene propylene copolymer adhesive in a hydrocarbon vehicle and dried at a temperature sufficient to drive off the hydrocarbon vehicle, but below the melting point of the polyolefin film and the adhesive. A corresponding strip of biaxially oriented polyacrylonitrile homopolymer film of approximately 0.65 mil 0.002 mm thick, was coated with a toluene solution containing 25E by weight solids, of a combination containing 6 parts by weight of a styrene butadiene block copolymer and 13 parts by weight of a terpolymer of 34 parts by weight of 1, 3 pentadiene, 36.5 parts by weight of beta phellandrene and 29.5 parts by weight of alphamethylstyrene. This layer was dried at 2300F 110 C for 20 minutes. The adhesive coated films were pressed together under modest pressure at least sufficient to cause a substantially uniform interfacial contact between the adhesives. The laminate was then heated at 3800F 195 C for 45 seconds. The laminate was irradiated with ultraviolet light through thePAN using a 1 KW, high pressure, water cooled mercury vapor lamp for 2 minutes and 50 seconds. This yielded a laminate which could only be peeled apart with the application of substantial force, i.e., a force significantly greater than 1 1 2 Ibs,rr 10 kPa Attempts to laminate the polyolefin film to the PAN film with the individual adhesive materials, either with or without the contemplated irradiation, did not result in an effective laminate. The laminates of Example 1 could be fabricated into retortable pouches employing known methods. In accordance with one such procedure, the laminate was folded over upon itself with the heat sealable polyolefin sides facing each other and these faces were edge sealed between heated plates. Such a pouch could be filled with food or other material, the top heat sealed and an effective retortable pouch thereby obtained. EXAMPLE 2 A further strip of biaxially oriented polyacrylonitrile homopolymer 0.65 mil 0.02 mm thick was coated with a toluene solution containing 25 by weight solids of a combination containing 6 parts by weight of a styrene butadiene block copolymer Kraton 1102 and 13 parts by weight of a terpolymer of 34 parts by weight of 1,3 pentadiene, 36.5 parts by weight of beta phellandrene and 29.5 parts by weight of alpha methylstyrene. This layer was dried at about 2300F 110 C for about 20 minutes. A corresponding adhesive coated PAN film was pressed against the first film under a modest pressure which was at least sufficient to cause a substantially uniform interfacial contact between the adhesives. The laminate was then heated at about 3800F 1930C for about 45 seconds. This laminate was thereafter irradiated with ultraviolet light using a 1 KW, high pressure, water cooled mercury vapor lamp for 2 minutes and 50 seconds. Again the laminate could only be peeled apart by applying a force significantly greater than 1 1 2 lbs. in 10 kPa . Attempts to laminate the PAN film with the adhesive material without the contemplated irradiation, did not result in as effective a laminate. The laminate of Example 2 could be fabricated into pouches or pipe like tubes, employing known methods. In accordance with one such procedure, the PAN film was folded over upon itself and edge sealed with the subject adhesive, in the manner of the foregoing example. Such a pouch could be filled with food or other material, and topsealed and after LW treating, an effective pouch was obtained. It is to be understood that laminates as used herein includes both full film width lamination with the UV treated adhesive or comparatively narrow line lamination to form selective bonding ofPAN to PAN. Tubes or pipes of PAN can be prepared, for example, by forming the PAN into a cylinder or tube with a slight overlap and placing the adhesive combination between the overlap regions.Thereafter, pressure and or heat is applied to the line lamination region and the bonded region irradiated with W.
