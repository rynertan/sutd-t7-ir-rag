## Description
Carboxylic Acid Functional Polysiloxane Polymers, Process for Preparing the same and Use thereof The present invention relates to polysiloxane polymers, particularly to carboxylic acid functional polysiloxane polymers and more particularly to a process for preparing carboxylic acid functional polys iloxane polymers. Background of the Invention Carboxylic acid functional polysiloxane polymers have been described in U. S. Patent No. 3,960,574 to Lee as additives for automobile polishes to impart detergent resistant properties to the standard types of automobile polishes. Also, U. S.Patent No. 4,011,362 to Stewart describes carboxylic acidfunctional polysiloxanes and their use as release coatings for metal substrates. These carboxylic acid functional polysiloxane polymers are composed of from 0.1 to 50 mole percent of Ra R b SiOq a b units and from 50 to 99.9 mole percent of 2 Rc SiO4 c units, where R is a carboxylic acid functional radical, 2R is a hydrocarbon or halogenated hydrocarbon radical, a has an average value of from 1 to 3, b has an average value bf from 0 to 2, with the sum of a b being from 1 to 3, R is a hydrocarbon or halogenated hydrocarbon radical1 and c has an average value of from 0 to 3.The carboxylic acid functional radical represented by R in the above formula is one which has the structure HOOC Q , where Q is a divalent linking group attached to the silicon atom via a silicon to carbon hond. Examples of divalent linking groups are alkylene radicals containing from 2 to 10 carbon atoms and radicals containing from 2 to 10 carbon atoms which are composed of carbon, hydrogen and sulfur atoms in which the sulfur atoms are present as the thioether linkages. Even though these references describe carboxylic acidfunctional siloxanes as release coatings for metal substrates and as ingredients for detergent resistant polishes, they do not disclose carboxylic acid functional siloxanes in which the carboxylic group is linked through an amide linking group to a silicon atom. Moreover, these patents do not disclose carboxylic acid functional siloxanes in which the carboxylic acid group is linked through an amide group to a silicon atom and contain at least one hydrocarbonoxy group. Furthermore, these references do not disclose treating textile materials with carboxylic acidfunctional polysiloxane polymers in which the carboxylic acid group is linked to the silicon through an amide group. Therefore, it is an object of this invention to provide carboxylic acid functional siloxanes. Another object of this invention is to provide a process for preparing carboxylic acidfunctional siloxanes. Still another object of this invention is to provide carboxylic acid functional siloxanes which may be used to treat textile materials to impart softness and water repellency thereto. Summary of the Invention The foregoing objects and others which will become apparent from the following description are accomplished in accordance with this invention, generally speaking, by providing carboxylic acid functional polysiloxane polymers having at least one unit of the formulaEMI2.1 in which A is a carboxylic acid functional radical having the formulaEMI2.2 wherein R is a monovalent hydrocarbon radical having up to 30 carbon atoms, R is a divalent hydrocarbon radical selected from the group consisting of CH2 y, CH CH, C14H26 or a cyclic hydrocarbon radical selected from the group consisting of C3H4, C4H6, C5H8, C6H4, C6H6, C6H8, C6H10 and C10H6, or a bicyclic radical selected from the group consisting of C7H8, C7H10, C8H10 and C8H13, R is selected from the group consisting of saturated divalent hydrocarbon radicals, hydrocarbonoxy radicals in which the hydrocarbon group is linked to the silicon by a carbon bond and the oxygen is in the form of an ether linkage and unsaturated divalent hydrocarbon radicals, a is a number of from 0 to 2, b is a number of from 0 to 10, and y is a number of from 0 to 10.The carboxylic acid functional polysiloxane polymers may also contain siloxane units of the formula RCS io4 c 2 where R is the same as above and c is a number of from 0 to 3, in which the siloxanes may be terminated with silanol, hydrocarbonoxy or triorganosiloxy groups. Detailed Description of the Invention The carboxylic acid functional polysiloxane polymers are preferably prepared by reacting dicarboxylic acids or cyclic anhydrides thereof with aminofunctional polysiloxanes having at least one unit of the formula Ra NH2 R NHR bSio3 a 2 and copolymers containing at least one unit having the above formula and at least one siloxane structural unit of the formula R SiO c 4 c 2 where R is a monovalent hydrocarbon radical, R is a divalent radical selected from the group consisting of saturated divalent hydrocarbon radicals, hydrocarbonoxy radicals in which the hydrocarbon group is linked to the silicon by a carbon bond and the oxygen is in the form of an ether linkage and unsaturated divalent hydrocarbon radicals, a, b and c are the sQme as above. The aminofunctional polysiloxanes may be either linear or cyclic aminoalkylpol ysiloxanes or aminoalkylal koxypolysi loxanes which have terminal silanol, hydrocarbonoxy or triorganosiloxy groups. Suitable examples of carboxylic acid functional radicals represented by A areEMI4.1 EMI5.1 EMI6.1 Among sne monovalent hydrocarbon radicals represented by R are alkyl radicals having from 1 to 30 carbon atoms, e.g., methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, octyl, dodecyl, octadecyl, triacontyl and the like cycloalkyl radicals, e.g., cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl and the like mononuclear and binuclear aryl radicals, e.g., phenyl, naphthyl and the like aralkyl radicals, e.g., benzyl, phenylethyl, phenylpropyl, phenylbutyl and the like alkaryl radicals, e.g., tolyl, xylyl, ethylphenyl and the like. Suitable examples of divalent hydrocarbon radicals represented by R having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms are methylene, ethylene, trimethylene, tetramethylene, pentamethylene, hexamethylene and octamethylene and decamethylene radicals. Examples of divalent aryl radicals represented by R are phenylene, naphthylene and cyclohexylene radicals. Suitable examples of divalent hydrocarbon radicals represented by R are radicals such as ethylene, trimethylene, hexamethylene, octamethylene hydrocarbonoxy containing radicals of the formula C2H4O m CH2 2 z C3H6O m CH2 z and C4H8O m CH2 where m is from 1 to 50, and z is a number of from 1 to 10, such as ethylene oxide, trimethylene oxide, tetramethylene oxide and polymers and copolymers thereof and alkenylene radicals such as vinylene, propenylene, butenylene, hexenylene and the like. Examples of suitable aminoalkylalkylpolysiloxanes are cyclic trimers, tetamers, and pentamers of gamma aminopropylmethylsiloxane, delta aminobutylmethylsiloxane, epsilon aminopentylmethylsiloxane and the like, as well as the hydrolyzates of gamma aminoalkylalkyldialkoxysilanes, i.e., gamma aminopropyl methyldialkoxysilanes with the aminopropylalkoxy,oolysiloxanes and the aminobutylalkoxypolysiloxanes. These aminofunctional polysiloxanes may be prepared in accordance with the process described in, for example, U. S. Patent No. 2,947,771 to Bailey or U. S. Patent 3,033,815 to Pike et al. Other aminofunctional polysiloxane polymers which may be employed in the reaction with dicarboxylic acids or anhy drides thereof are those described in U. S. Patent 3who. 3,890,269 to Martin. These polysiloxane polymers are prepared by esuili brating a mixture containing an organopolysiloxane fluid and an aminofunctional silane or siloxane in the presence of a base catalyst. Suitable examples of cyclic anhydrides which may be used to prepare the compositions of this invention are succinic anhydride, glutaconic anhydride, maleic anhydride, 1,2 cyclo hexane dicarboxylic anhydride, 1 cyclohexane 1, 2 dicarboxylic anhydride, 3 cyclohexene 1,2 dicarboxylic anhydride, 4 cyclohexene 1,2 dicarboxylic anhydride, 1,8 naphthalic acid anhydride, phthalic anhydride, hexahydrophthalic anhydrid and methylbicyclo 2,2,1 heptane 2,3 dicarboxylic anhydride. Generally, any dicarboxylic acid can be used to make the compositions of this invention with the proviso that it does not contain a reactive functional group other than the carboxylic acid group which will react with the amine group. Examples of suitable dicarboxylic acids are oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, glutamic acid, adipic acid, pimelic acid, suberic acid, 1,1 cyclopropane dicarboxylic acid, 1,2 cyclopropane dicarboxylic acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid, 1,1 cyclobutane dicarboxylic acid, 1,3 cyclobutane dicarboxylic acid, 1,2 cyclopentane dicarboxylic acid, 1,3 cyclopentane dicarboxylic acid, phthalic acid and tetrahydrophthalic acid. The reaction between the dicarboxylic acid or cyclic anhydride thereof and the aminofunctional polysiloxane is exothermic and may be carried out at a temperature ranging from about 500C up to about 125 C or higher for a period of time varying from a few minutes up to several hours. When a cyclic anhydride is reacted with the amino functional polysiloxane, the resultant product contains an amide linkage, whereas when a dicarboxylic acid is reacted with the aminofunctional polysiloxane an ammonium carboxylate is formed and the resultant product must be heated to an elevated temperature, e.g., above about 1003C or higher to form the corresponding amide. The water by product thus formed may be removed at atmospheric pressure or at reduced pressure. In certain instances, it is preferred that an organic solvent capable of azeotroping with the water be employed to facilitate water removal. Examples of suitable organic solvents which may be used are heptane, toluene and xylene. Although it is not essential, it is preferred that the reaction between the.dicarboxylic acid or anhydride thereof and the aminofuncticnal polysiloxane be conducted in an inert atmos phere. The reaction may also be carried out in the presence or absence of a solvent. Generally, it is preferred that the mole ratio of dicarboxylic acid groups or cyclic anhydrides thereof to amine group to be reacted be about 2 1 to 1 2 and more preferably about 1 1. It is preferred, but not essential that all the amine groups be reacted with the dicarboxylic acid or cyclic anhydride. However, a slight excess of either reactant will not substantially alter the utility of the composition of this invention. These carboxylic acid functional polysiloxane polymers may be mixed with various diluents such as alcohols, e.g., ethanol and 1 propanol aliphatic solvents such as heptane and iso octane aromatic solvents such as toluene and xylene and chlorinated solvents such as chloroform and 1,l,1 trichloroethan e. Other diluents which may be employed are triorganosiloxy terminated diorganopolysiloxanes such as dimethylpolysiloxanes, silanol terminated dimethylpolysiloxanes, alkoxy terminated dimethylpolysiloxanes, cyclic siloxanes such as octamethylcyclo tetrasiloxane, and organofunctional polysiloxanes such as mercaptofunctional polysiloxanes. These carboxylic acid functional polysiloxanes may also be dissolved or dispersed in water. The carboxylic acid functional polysiloxane polymers may be used to treat textile fabrics to impart softness and water repellency to the fabrics. They may be applied to textile fabrics in concentrated form or diluted with a diluent. The amount of carboxylic acid functional polysiloxane present in the diluent may range from about 0.25 to 99 percent, preferably from about 2 to 50 percent by weight based on the weight of the carboxylic acid functional polysiloxane and diluent. These carboxylic acid functional polysiloxanes, and if desired other substances, may be applied to all textile materials, preferably organic textile materials on which organopolys iloxanes have been or could have been applied heretofore. Examples of such textile materials are wool, cotton, rayon, hemp, natural silk, polypropylene, polyethylene, polyester, polyurethane, polyamide, cellulose acetate, polyacrylonitrile fibers, and mixtures of such fibers. The textile materials may consist of staple fibers or monofilaments. The carboxylic acid functional polysiloxanes of this invention and other substances, if desired, may be applied to the textile materials by any means known in the art, such as by spraying, immersion, padding, calendering or by gliding the fibers across a base which has been saturated with the carboxylic acid functional polysiloxanes of this invention and other materials, if desired. Generally, the solids add on is in the range of from 0.001 to 20 percent and more preferably from about 0.05 to 10 percent, based on the original weight of the textile material. After the textile material has been treated, it is dried at an elevated temperature, e.g., from about 50 to 200 C for a brief period of time, e.g., from about 3 to 15 minutes. These carboxylic acid functional polysiloxanes ray be used alone or combined with aminoplast resins or certain crosslinking agents, e.g., melamine to achieve a durable finish. The carboxylic acid functional siloxane polymers of this invention may also be used as release coatings for metal substrates such as molds and fuser rolls. These carboxylic acid functional siloxane polymers may be applied to the substr ate alone or in admixture with a conventional silicone, e.g., dimethylpolysiloxanes. They also may be incorporated in polishes of all kinds to impart durability to the films formed on an article to be polished, e.g., automobiles and furniture. In certain applications it is advantageous to use these carboxylic acid functional siloxane polymers with aminofunctional polysiloxanes or silicone resins to further enhance the durability of the polishes.
