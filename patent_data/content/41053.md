## Description
Method for manufacturing heat insulating and soundproofing pebbles and balls.This invention relates to a method for manufacturing pebbles or balls of varying diameter, constituted by a mixture of powders or granules of heat insulating and soundproofing characteristics, which are either mixed or not mixed with inert powders, are bonded together by cement, includingPortland cement, and subjected to centrifugal action, together with a machine for carrying out said method.The main characteristic and object of the invention is to convert into pebbles or balls the powder or small granules deriving from mineral or vegetable materials having special insulating properties, such as mica, pumice, rockwool, asbestos, cellular concrete, sawdust, ground straw, rice or wheat husks, silica subjected to an expansion process known commercially as Perlite , biotic mica subjected to an expansion process known commercially as Vermiculite , tufa and vulcanic materials in general, granulated polystyrene, granulated rubber including that deriving from the demolition of used tyres, residues and slag deriving from the combustion of organic substances, ground plastics materials of any kind including those deriving from the collection of urban refuse , cork in powder or granular form, corn cobs, stems and leaves of corn, subflowers and the like, suitably ground algae and reeds, fruit stones and pee.., husks in general, grapeseeds and distillation residues, and other materials suitable for the purpose. The method consists substantially of preparing a mixture of powdery ingredients having special thermal, acoustic and lightness properties, in suitable proportions as specified hereinafter throughly mixing said substances and subjecting them to centrifugal action by feeding them into a suitable machine shown on the accompanying drawings in which it is diagrammatically illustrated.The method for manufacturing pebbles or balls is as follows the batch is firstly prepared using the following basic quan tities which have been found to be the most suitable and generally lying within a cement powdered material volume ratio of 1 30 to 1 35 using the following ingredients, by way of example only one part by volume of Portland cement two parts by volume of inert powdered stone ground to a very fine 00 powder, or powdered hydrated lime 30 parts by volume of powdered or granular mica that known commercially as Vermiculite is excellent .The aforesaid ingredients in these proportions are mixed together in, the dry state, and the mixture is gradually fed into the cylinder, a sufficient quantity of water is sprayed therein in an atomised state in order to moisten the mixture.Dry pure cement is also sprayed in, and by virtue of the rotation this coats the periphery of the pebbles, toform a type of outer crust which contributes to increasing their compression strength, and also gives the pebble constructed in this manner a certain degree of waterproofing. If considered necessary, the waterproofing can be improved by adding suitable normally used additives, and also fireproofing products in the case of vegetable powders.The component ingredients of the aforesaid mixture are given only by way of example, because many other heat insula ting materials suitable for this purpose can be used, either as powders or as materials for bonding the mix to be converted into balls.The proportions given can also vary according to the charac teristics and requirements of the raw materials used.In particular, the term cement refers to any cementing material, such as Portland cement, pozzuolana cement, refractory cerent, aluminous cement, iron cement, plaster, bitumens, tars, synthetic resin cements and the like.The inert powders possibly used as fillers in the mixture can for example be pozzuolana, lapillus, anhydrous calcium sulphate, raw chalk, powdered stone or marble, powdered granite, hydrated lime, powdered metals and the like. The raw materials of powder form with heat insulating properties indicated heretofore are at the present time sold in bags, and in the building industry are either used in their dry state or agglomerated with cement materials to form light insulating castings. The conversion of these materials into pebbles or balls leads to considerable economical and technical advantages, of which the main ones are indicated hereinafter 1 The ability to deliver material in bulk rather than in bags as is necessary in the case of powders. The cost of the bags and the bag filling operation is therefore obviated.2 As a consequence, the material can be transported loose using tipping trucks 3 The facility for pumping upwards from tankers using com pressed air, with consequent savings in the unloading operations and the raising of the material to a higher level.4 The possibility of particle size selection for the various types of concrete.5 Improved concrete mix yield. At the present time, one cubic metre of concrete requires on an average 1.3 cubic metres of powders.6 Use of the pebbles for hydroponic flower and garden cul tures.7 Roof insulation by speading the pebbles dry, and then applying a cement grout for stabilising purposes. 8 Replacing the polystyrene of sandwich panels with pebbles made from vegetable materials, so obviating the lethal polystyrene gas in the case of fire. 9 A smaller quantity of water in the mixes and thus accelerated drying of the castings.10 Construction of prefabricated blocks for partitions of the like.Further uses are not indicated because of their obvious nature.It should however be noted that, especially in the case of pebbles of vegetable materials, large dimension blocks can for example be constructed, and after curing can be sawn into slices of the required thickness, they then being incorpora ted into the thickness of any building casting for lightening and so sound and acoustic insulation purposes, as it at present done with other materials, and in particular with polystyrene.Particularly interesting are some results achieved by using a sand or little grain obtained from grinding or crushing a cellular concrete as starting material in the process according to the invention.It is known that the cellular concrete is a cement compound which lightness is due to the homogeneous distribution of little gas and or air bubbles in the bulk. By changing the quantities of gas or air dispersed in the bulk, materials may be obtained having specific gravities from 300 to 1600 kg 3 m , and therefrom insulating, soundproofing, and strength characteristics varying within a large range. Furthermore, concrete density may be varied also through the addition of powdered inerts chosen from those haviightness and insulating properties, such as pumice, lapillus, expanded clay, vermiculite, perlite, and others.The foams used for enclosing air into the connective Dulk may be of any type and quality, for example synthetic expanded resins.Other cellular concretes are already available, for example those sold with the trade marks Foamcem, Murfoam, Escumo 75,Cellum, Isoltav, and the like. In practice, the cellular concrete used as starting material in the process according to the invention is prepared by the following method a a cement mud is prepared, if necessary with the adddi tion of inert substances, dispersing therein little air bubbles, from 20 to 80 microns b after the cement prepared as above has setted, it will be crushed for obtaining sand or little grain having as characteristics closed alveolus formed from little air bubbles dispersed in the bulk.Then sand or little grain may be converted into pebbles.The centrifuging for producing the pebbles as described heretofore is done by using the machine shown diagrammatically in Figure 1, in which 1 is a container silo into which the mixed raw materials are fed in their dry state see example , and are then fed into the cylinder 3 which is rotated with a rotational speed adjusted according to the quantity of mixture to be centrifuged.The cylinder 3 comprises a pipe which, by way of various cocks, carries the water necessary for moistening the mixture which, by rolling under the influence of centrifugal force and by virtue of the inclination of the cylinder, begins to form balls and slides until it discharges into a hopper from which it is fed into the next cylinder 5 where, after being dusted with cement from the vessel 4, continues its centrifugal rolling and becomes wrapped with a subsequent layer of pure cement which completes the pebble by means of an outer resistant crust. A conveyor belt is disposed at the outlet of the cylinder 5 to discharge the pebbles on to screens for their selection and separation into the various particles sizes, they then being fed into store for curing. The pebbles are thus ready for use.Some examples of specific mixtures are given hereinafter in order to further illustrate the subject matter of the invention, but without in any way limiting it. EXAMPLE 1Pebbles of various sizes, especially suitable for constructing strong, light road embankments with high heat insuia ting power, for clay or peat ground having a low. load bearing capacity, and subject to very low external temperature a Powdered Perlite density 90 kg m3 3 m3 270 kg b Powdered pumice density 900 kg m3 4 m3 3,600 kg c Cement binder density 1,600 kg m3 0.25 m 400 kgAfter mixing the said ingredients with a minimum quantity of water and drying, a mixed block is obtained having a 3 volume of about 7.250 m and a weight of about 4.720 kg, with a density of 589 kg m3 If however the mixture is converted into pebbles according to the invention, there is an increase in volume due to ther voidetween the pebbles of 30 , thus giving an appa 3 rent density of about 413 kg m The pebbles manufactured in this manner are used instead of common gravel, with the advantage of reducing the weight 3 of the embankment gravel density 1,699 kg m3 in comparison 3 with 413 kg m for the new product The addition of pumice as an inert material makes the product considerably more economical.Because of its hear insulation and lightness characteristics, the material obtained can be very widely used for road embankments for example in the Scandinavian countries. If necessary, the pebbles can be waterproofed by adding a suitable waterproofing liquid to the mixing water used in the plant.EXAMPLE 2Pebbles of various sizes for heat and sound insulation.a Expanded clay, particle size 1 3 density 530 kg m 1 m3 530 kg b Powdered Perlite or Vermiculite 3 density 90 kg m3 2 m 180 kg c Portland cement 200 kgAfter being mixed and dried, the aforesaid materials have 3 a density of 330 kg m . When converted into pebbles, these materials show a volume increase of 30 , and thus an appa 3 rent density of 231 kg m3. As thermal conductivity is known to be also a function of the apparent density of a material, and is lower the lower the weight per unit volume, the new material in pebble form has insulating characteristics which are much better than expanded clay alone.Again, expanded clay has a pi of 0.08, whereas Perlite orVermiculite has aA of 0.04, and thus also for this reason the new material has a, which is much better than that of expanded clay, with the advantage of a weight per unit volume which is approximately halved.EXAMPLE 3Balls of vegetable materials bonded with cement or plaster.These balls are suitable for example for incorporation into plasterboard to form lightweight partition elements or air spaces in building.a sawdust or other ground vegetable materials, possibly treated with fireproofing additives T00 parts by weight b Portland cement, plaster or magnesite 10 parts by weightThe pebbles prepared with the said ingredients are incorporated into a plaster mix in quantity of up to 60 by volume to obtain castings having a weight less than the plaster mix alone, but with much better heat and sound insulation charcateristics.EXAMPLE 4Pebbles of various sizes, especially suitable for insulating intermediate floors.a powdered Perlite density 90 kg m3 1 m3 90 kg b granulated polystyrene density 60 kg m3 1 m 60 kg c cement type 350. 0.20 m3 300 kgAfter drying, the mixture obtained from the said materials 3 has a density of 204 kg m3. The same mixture when converted into pebbles according to the invention has an apparent density of 204 x 0.7 142.8 3 kg m The pebble material obtained has a compression strength of 2 about 120 kg cm In addition to the stated insulation of floors, it is par ticularly useful for manufacturing blocks and slabs having a weight considerably less than the blocks at present available on the building market.
