# Method of making a stiffened composite metal panel.

## Abstract
A stiffened composite metal panel is made by providing a layer of metal with spaced grooves of a depth less than the thickness of the metal layer for defining separable strips of the layer and, after arranging stripes of bond preventing ma terial between limited portions of the respective separable strips and a second metal layer, the metal layers are passed between pressure bonding rolls with reduction in the thick ness of the layer materials to metallurgically bond a portion of each separable strip to the second metal layer to form a composite metal panel while leaving a portion of each sep arable strip free of such bonding at the location of the bond preventing stripe. The separable strips are then broken apart along the grooves and folded away from the second metal layer to form precisely located stiffening ribs in the composite panel.
