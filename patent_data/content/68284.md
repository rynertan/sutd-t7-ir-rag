# Wear resistant alloy.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a wear resistant alloy which com prises, in terms of weight ratio, 10 to 45 of chromium, 3 to 15 of niobium, 4 to 20 of molybdenum, 0.01 to 2.0 of boron, and nickel as the remainder. The wear resistant alloy having a novel composition of the present invention is suitable for face portions of valves used in various plants such as a chemical plant and an atomic power plant, parts of jet pumps and sliding parts for various machines.
