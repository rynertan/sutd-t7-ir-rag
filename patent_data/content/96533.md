# An improved wire carrier and edge protector trim strip formed therefrom.

## Abstract
An improved channel shaped wire carrier is coated with elastomeric material to form an edge protector trim strip of substantially U shaped transverse cross section. The wire carrier is formed from a continuous metallic wire looped to form looped ends adjacent the edges of the carrier joined by transversely extending lengths of wire spaced from one another longitudinally of the carrier. A plurality of strands of material extend longitudinally of the carrier and are inter woven with the wires to maintain the spaced relation thereof. At least two of the strands are located along the looped ends at each edge of the carrier and are forced together by the curvature of the looped ends prior to the coating operation to form at least a pair of grouped edge strands. The remaining strands are located only along intermediate portions of the base and side flanges of the channel shaped wire carrier.
