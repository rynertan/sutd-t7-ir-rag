# Improvements in and relating to linear bearings.

## Abstract
A ball bearing for linear motion of the open type comprises a bearing sleeve 4 adapted to position a plurality of bearing segments 30, 32 on its inside surface. Each bearing segment 30, 32 contains a closed loop of circulating balls 14 . The closed loop has one straight track 13 of load bearing balls and one straight track 15 of non load bearing balls. The bearing segments 30, 32 are circumferentially positioned within the bearing sleeve 4 so as to maximize the capacity of the bearing when load is applied either toward or away from the open side 6 of the bearing.
