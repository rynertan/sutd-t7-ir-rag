## Description
DEVICE TO MOVE A CARRIAGE FOR DOFFING YARN PACKAGES AND PIECING UP YARN ON TWO FACES OF A TEXTILE MACHINE This invention concerns a device to move a carriage for doffing yarn packages and piecing up yarn on two faces of a textile machine and, in particular, of a machine for processing yarn, such as a twisting machine, winding machine or a normal or open end spinning machine. To be more exact, the invention concerns a device able to control the movement of a carriage for doffing yarn packages and piecing up yarn so that the carriage can pass from one face to the other face of an open end spinning machine or other machine for processing yarn, and also able to control the movement of such carriage along such faces. The invention also concerns a textile machine to process yarn, such as an open end spinning machine, ring spinning machine, winding machine, twisting machine, etc. which employs a device to move the carriage for doffing yarn packages and piecing up yarn in accordance with the invention. We shall refer hereinafter specifically to an open end spinning machine as being a preferred but not restrictive application, but it is understood that the invention can be applied to twisting machines, winding machines, ring spinning machines, etc. Embodiments are known which are intended to serve both faces of an open end spinning machine by means of one single carriage for doffing yarn packages and piecing up yarn. For this purpose guides or rails are provided which are shaped substantially like a U or even surround the spinning machine wholly and are able to permit the carriage doffing yarn packages to run along each face of the spinning machine. Moreover, such guides enable the carriage to rotate about the ends of the machine, or about one end of the machine when the guides are U shaped, so as to enable both faces of the machine and their relative spinning units to be serviced by one single carriage. Such embodiments entail many drawbacks. One drawback lies in the fact that the rails or guides for the running of the carriage are located in the upper part of the machine to which the carriage is fitted and in the lower part of the machine at the height of the spinning units. This involves difficulty in being able to have access to the machine, for instance, so as to change the slivers or for an inspection or cleaning or examination or maintenance. Furthermore, such known embodiments entail an excessive bulk of the immovable parts such as the rails or guides and the relative uprights or supports such a bulk may exist not only crosswise to the machine to which the carriage is fitted, but also lengthwise in correspondence with the ends where the guides or rails follow a substantially semi circular path. Besides, the presence of guides at the ends of the machine makes it hard, or may make it hard, to have access to the controls, which are usually to be found precisely at the ends of the machine. Embodiments in the name of the present applicant are known which disclose the employment of lengthwise guides placed above the machine, the carriage being supported at one end on an arm able to run on such guides by means of an appropriate central plate 112 of the trolley 12 which comprises two reentrant portions 212 for the arrival of the feed pipes 26 bringing the feed of aspiration air to the carriage 16. Side frame members 31 of the frame of the trolley 12 can be seen in the figure, as well as terminal axles 32 132, of which the axle 132 contains a shaft 33 which supplies motion from the reduction gear 119 to the wheels 18. In this instance two bars 34 having a tubular shape and superimposed, one on another, are solidly fixed to the frame of the trolley 12 and bear at their centre portion a collar 134 integrally fixed to them. A bar 35 having collars 135 at its ends can slide by means of such collars 135 on the cylindrical bars 34 and is kept in position by spring means 36. The bar 35 supports sets of stop means 37 having the form of catches 137 in this case. These catches 137 are normally kept in their extended position 137A by torsion spring means but can be retracted to position 137B through the action of actuation means 337. In this example the means 337 consist of pneumatic or hydraulic pistons connected to the carriage 16, but the invention visualises that the means 337 can be embodied in any required manner, namely as mechanical or electrical means, etc. The catches 137 engage stationary abutments 39 located on the spinning machine 11 along the rails 113 and visible inFig.3a as well. The particular form and positioning of the catches 137 have the effect that, when the catches 137 arrive in correspondence with the positioner abutments 39, they can move until they contain the positioner abutment 39 between them. When the first catch 137 has passed beyond the positioner abutment 39 during movement of the trolley 12, the catch 137 is tripped to position 137A by the action of the spring 38 so that both the catches 137 are at the sides of the abutment 39, and the abutment 39 acts against the catch at 137A which is further behind in relation to the direction of movement of the trolley 12. The trolley 12 is halted in this way against the positioner abutment 39 and is withheld by the catches 137. Springs 36 which cushion the halting of the trolley 12 are included so as to obtain a gentle stopping action, for the trolley 12 itself together with the collar 134 solidly fixed to the bars 34 compresses the springs 36, which firstly absorb the energy of motion of the trolley 12 and then bring it back to the position determined by the positioner abutment 39. When the trolley 12 has to be moved to take the carriage 16 so as to correspond with the spinning unit 23 to be serviced, the pneumatic pistons 337 are actuated and cause retraction of the catches 137 to position 137B. The catches 137 in this position 137B press no longer against the positioner abutment 39 and it is therefore possible for the trolley 12 to run lengthwise along the rails 113. Like abutment means 45 with catches 237 and abutments 139 serve to halt rotation of the arm 15 in relation to the trolley 12, as is shown in Figs.4a and 4b. In this case catches 237 positioned vertically are present, and in the example shown there is only one pair of catches 237. Positioner abutments 139 are comprised on both sides of the trolley 12 and engage the catches 237 in a manner fully analogous to that shown in Figs.3a and 3b. Moreover, so as to ensure an accurate alignment and rigid connection of the carriage 16 in relation to the trolley 12, a catch means 40 is included which consists of a rod with a tapered end 140 able to cooperate with a seating 240. The rod Each spinning unit 23 corresponds with a work position of the carriage 16. Fig.2 shows one of the spinning units 23 with a yarn package in the process of formation, the carriage 16 being positioned before the spinning unit 23. Fig.3a shows in greater detail the device 10 that rotates the carriage 16. The arm 15 which rotates the carriage 16 can be seen high up, and to the arm 15 is connected by means of the plate 14 see Figs.4 a rotation pivot 25 driven by a rotary piston 20. Two feed pipes 26 are solidly fixed to the rotation arm 15 of the carriage 16 and are alternatively connected to a sleeve 126 and blind sleeve 226 respectively, depending on the position of the arm 15 on one or the other face of the spinning machine 11. A seal is obtained with resilient collars 46. Likewise, another resilient collar 46 placed at the lower end of the sleeve 126 ensures an airtight seal for outlet holes 128 of a duct 28 which aspirates air. Each of the holes 128 is positioned in correspondence with a spinning unit 23 and is closed with a rotatable cover 27 see Fig.3c . On arrival of the trolley 12 at the spinning unit 23 to be serviced, the feed pipe 26 displaces the cover 27 from position 27A or 27C, depending on the direction of movement of the trolley 12 to position 27B in which the corresponding hole 128 is uncovered. The collar 46 ensures an airtight seal between the hole 128 and sleeve 126. In this way one of the two feed pipes 26 is always in communication with the duct 28 through the sleeve 126, whereas the other feed pipe 26 is engaged with the blind sleeve 226 and is therefore cut out. Both the feed pipes 26 form an end of one single aspiration duct 47. When the trolley 12 moves away, the cover 27 is thus taken to 27C or 27A, depending on the direction of movement , as is shown in Fig.3c. Moreover, two small channels 29 and 129 can be seen below the movable trolley 12 and serve to guide in a known manner a chain 30 which supports a hose for the pneumatic feed of compressed air and a cable for the electricity supply, so as to actuate the various functions of the carriage 16. Such chain 30 takes the feed and supply at the centre of the machine and can run respectively within the small channel 29 and small channel 129 each of the two small channels 29129 occupies half of the length of the machine 11 to which the invention is fitted. The small channels 29 129 are staggered in height or have guides staggered in height so as to enable the chain 30 to run on the two corresponding surfaces. In fact, starting from the centre and assuming the trolley 12 to be in a generic position along the machine 11, the chain 30 travels along a tract in the lower channel 29 and then withdraws and is supported lastly in the upper channel 129. When the trolley 12 moves, the chain 30 is unwound along the lower channel 29 to a limit position where it is lying completely in the lower channel 29, and to another limit position where it is lying completely in the upper channel 129. Fig.3b shows the device 10 of Fig.3a from below with a partial view. The rail 113 is evident on which the wheels 18, not visible in Fig.3a, run. Opposed rollers 118, which roll against the lower side of the rails 113, prevent the movable trolley 12 from being lifted from the rails 113 Rollers or wheels 218 are also included which run horizontally on the inner side of the rail 113 and thus ensure the stability and horizontal alignment of the movable trolley 12. In the view from below in Fig.3b it is possible to see a In the example of Fig.1 the arm 15 is shown diagrammatically as being single but the invention also envisages advantageously an arm 15 embodied with multiple elements such as tubular elements, or channel sections, or other elements of an equivalent type see Figs.4 so as to obtain the required rigidity. A doffing carriage 16 is supported at one of its ends in a rigid manner by the end of the arm 15. As can be seen in Fig.1 , the doffing carriage 16 can be rotated as shown by an arrow 17 when the trolley 12 reaches one or the other end of the spinning machine 11. The carriage 16 can be brought in this way so as to correspond with one or the other face of the spinning machine 11, as required. Fig.1 shows with lines of dashes the trajectory followed by the carriage 16 about the spinning machine 11. In Fig.2 the runway 13 on which the movable trolley 12 runs consists, in this instance, of two rails 113, one per face of the machine and positioned substantially in correspondence with the top 111 of the spinning machine 11. The trolley 12 has wheels 18, which are four in number in this case. Such wheels 18 are driven by a motor 19, which is shown in Fig.3b, through an appropriate reduction gear 119. The drive may be obtained on one axle, as in the example shown, or on more than one axle, according to requirements. Fig.2 shows also, in the lower part of the movable trolley 12, a rotary piston 20, which has the function of actuating the rotation of the arm 15 and therefore of the carriage 16 connected to the arm 15. Along both faces of the spinning machine 11 are provided devices 21 to convey tubes, the devices 21 having the task of feeding tubes 22 to spinning units 23 located on each face of the spinning machine 11. We shall describe now a preferred embodiment of the invention as a non restrictive example with the help of the attached figures, in which Fig.1 gives a plan diagram of an open end spinning machine with a carriage provided with a rotation device accor ding to the invention Fig.2 gives a view of the rotation device together with the arm and the carriage Figs.3a and 3b show details of the stop means and means to cushion the halt of the movable trolley Fig.3c shows a detail of the intakes which aspirate air and of the relative closure means Figs.4 lastly show the means to clamp and stop the arm in relation to the movable trolley. In Fig.1 a device of the invention is indicated with 10 and in this instance is fitted to a spinning machine of an openend type referenced with 11. Such an application should not be deemed restrictive as the invention can be fitted also to other types of machines, as was made clear earlier. In this case the device consists of a slidable trolley 12 which can move lengthwise along the spinning machine 11 by means of a runway 13 located on the centre line of the spinning machine 11. Such runway 13 can have one or more rails of any required shape, the trolley 12 being equipped with suitable means 18 able to roll, such as wheels, rollers or other equivalent means. It is also possible to obtain the movement of the trolley 12 by means of toothed wheels cooperating with one or more racks positioned lengthwise along the runway 13. A rotatable plate 14 is located on top of the trolley 12 and is connected rigidly to an arm indicated diagrammatically with 15. only in the immediate neighbourhood of the ends of the machine to which the carriage is fitted. In this way, during the ordinary working of the carriage along one or the other of the faces of the machine, the carriage itself remains solidly and rigidly connected by the arm which supports it, to the trolley able to move along the top guide. Only when the carriage reaches one of the end positions of the machine is the arm supporting the carriage able to rotate in relation to the movable trolley. The invention envisages also damper means intended to make the carriage halt gently both in correspondence with each spinning unit and also after its rotation so as to obviate heavy vibrations and stresses on the carriage and on the movable trolley and the relatve rails or guides. The invention is therefore embodied with a device to move a carriage for doffing yarn packages and piecing up yarn on two faces of a textile machine which processes yarn, such as openend spinning machines, winding machines, twisting machines, etc., the carriage being supported at one end on arm means by a trolley able to move on guides along the machine to which the device is fitted, the device being characterized by the facts that the guides are sole guides and are placed on the centre line of the machine and above the latter, and that the movable trolley comprises at least stop means, means to actuate rotation of the arm and catch means to clamp the arm means. Moreover, the invention is obtained with a textile machine to process yarn, such as open end spinning machines, ring spinning machines, winding machines, twisting machines, etc., the textile machine being characterized by the fact that it employs a device as described above. trolley. Although this embodiment is satisfactory from the bulk point of view since it requires neither lower guides nor guides surrounding the machine, yet it needs a carriage for each face of the machine. It is a purpose of this invention to eliminate the above drawbacks by providing a device to rotate the arm on which the doffing carriage is supported at one end. Such arm is rotatably connected to a trolley able to move along one single lengthwise guide or rail positioned at the top and on the centre line of the machine to which the carriage is fitted. According to the invention one single guide or rail arranged at the top and on the centre line of the machine is enough in this way, instead of a rail or set of rails located about the periphery of the machine or instead of a guide for each carriage, for one single carriage will service both faces of the spinning machine. Moreover, the fact that rails or guides surrounding the machine are not envisaged makes it possible to adopt an overall length of rail or guide equal to less than half, or substantially equal to half, of the length required by the known art. The invention envisages the use of simple stop means intended to determine the position of the halting of the carriage precisely in correspondence with each spinning unit. Such stop means are necessary because, for the operation of doffing a yarn package and piecing up the yarn, it is necessary for the traveller carriage to stop at a well determined position in front of the spinning unit to be serviced. Furthermore, the invention envisages means to clamp the rotation of the arm to which the carriage is solidly fixed such clamp means can be disactivated to permit such rotation 40 is guided in a guide 340, which is tubular in this instance and solidly fixed to a support 42. The seating 240 is made, in this instance, in the abutment 139 but could also be made separately, according to the invention, in another part rigidly connected to the trolley 12. The catch 40 is actuated here by a jack 41 but could have actuation means of another type, mechanical or electrical, for example. The jack 41 in its turn is connected by brackets 141 to a support element 42, which in turn supports the tubular bars 234. An element 43 that supports the catches 237 with relative release pistons, which are not shown here but are of the same type as the pistons 337 of Fig.3b, can run on the bars 234 so as to obtain a damping effect. When the carriage 16 is required to move from one face to the other of the spinning machine 11, it is brought into correspondence with one end of the spinning machine 11 by the trolley 12 running along the runway 13. When the trolley 12 reaches the end of the spinning machine 11, it stops in correspondence with a station for the start of rotation owing to the action of catches 137, this station being located beyond the last spinning unit. The catch means 40 and catches 237 are then released and the hydraulic piston 20 is L P rr F CTTTLactuated. a revolution and is halted on the opposite face of the spinning machine 11 by catches that engage the positioner abutment 139. The end of rotation is cushioned by the springs 136.The catch means 40 is actuated again by the jack 41 and creates a rigid and accurately aligned connection of the arm 15 to the trolley 12. The trolley 12 moves and brings the carriage 16 in front of the spinning unit 23 to be serviced. The pistons 337 remain actuated, with the catches at 137B, until the trolley 12 reaches the neighbourhood of the abutment 39 corresponding with the spinning unit 23 to be serviced. Means to sense the position of the carriage 16 and of the spinning unit 23 to be serviced can be envisaged for this purpose, the movement of the trolley 12 being controlled by a logical unit for corrective action. This can be obtained, for instance, by means of an electronic unit to control the actuation of the device 10. In the embodiment shown the arm 15 consists of two steel sections 115 solidly attached to the plate 14 and bearing the carriage 16 at one end. The carriage 16 in this example is suspended on the sections 115 by means of bolted brackets 116. In this case an adjustment screw 44 enables the exact position of the carriage 16 to be regulated at the time it is fitted after the bolts connecting the brackets 116 to the carriage 16 have been slackened off.
