# A pressurized cartridge for a writing instrument.

## Abstract
A writing instrument cartridge 10 contains a loose fitting ball follower 18 disposed within the cartridge between an end of a column of paste like ink 16 exhibiting a yield value, and compressed gas contained in a sealed end of the cartridge. The ball follower is adapted to help peel the ink from the tube walls 20 without contact to prevent the gas from channeling through the ink and escaping from the cartridge past a ball point 14 or nib during writing.
