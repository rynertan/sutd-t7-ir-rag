# Both side single layer, high speed submerged arc welding process.

## Abstract
A process for both side single layer, high speed submerged arc welding of steel plate for use in low temperature applications having a particular chemical composition with a welding flux and welding wire is disclosed. The welding flux comprises 20 to 30 wt of SiO₂, less than 25 wt of at least one of TiO₂ and ZrO₂, 10 to 20 wt of CaO, less than 10 wt of at least one of MnO and MgO, not more than 10 wt of Aℓ₂O₃ and 20 to 40 wt in total of CaF₂ and BaO each being not more than 20 wt , wherein a total content of acidic components SiO₂ TiO₂ ZrO₂ is 30 to 45 wt , a total content of basic components CaO MgO MnO is 20 to 30 wt and a weight ratio of the total content of basic components to the total content of acidic components is within a range of 0.5 to 0.8 said these components being compounded so that a surface tension F of slag is not more than 450 dyne cm as calculated from the following equation 1 F 285 SiO₂ 380 TiO₂ 470 ZrO₂ 640 Aℓ₂O₃ 653 MnO 512 MgO 602 CaO 400 CaF₂ 365 BaO 1 wherein a parenthesis represents a mol fraction of each component. The welding wire is composed of steel wire containing up to 0.10 wt of carbon, up to 0.4 wt of silicon, 1.0 to 2.5 wt of manganese, 0.015 to 0.05 wt of aluminum. not more than 0.008 wt of nitrogen, 0.10 to 0.18 wt of titanium and 0.01 to 0.02 wt of boron. The welding flux and welding wire are used in combination with each other so that a carbon equivalent C of the resulting weld metal is 0.35 to 0.43 as calculated from the following equation 2 C C 1 24Si 1 6Mn 1 4Mo 1 5Cr 1 40Ni 1 14V 2 to thereby obtain a weld metal containing not more than 0.008 wt of nitrogen, 0.025 to 0.035 wt of oxy gen. 0.0015 to 0.0030 wt of boron, 0.015 to 0.030 wt of titanium and 0.010 to 0.030 wt of aluminum and having a high low temperature toughness without weld defects.
