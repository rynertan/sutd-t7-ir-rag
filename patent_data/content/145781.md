## Description
The present invention relates to a gasket according to the preamble of Claim 1. A gasket of this kind is previously known from DE C 1 055 460. Thus, this document shows and describes a gasket in the form of a sealing sleeve for connecting an outlet stud of a water closet with the socket of a sewer pipe. The gasket according to DE C 1 055 460 has a substantially I shaped cross section in which the bars of the I form a sliding part and an attachment part respectively and the web forms a connection part extending substantially perpendicular to the axis of the sleeve and connecting the sliding part and the attachment part with each other. The sliding and attachment parts form with each other an angle of about 35 in the non mounted condition of the gasket with the spacing between them increasing from the front end of the gasket towards the rear. The object of the present invention is to provide a gasket of the type described above, which is improved in especially two respects. Thus, it is the object of the invention to provide a sealing gasket of the kind defined in the preamble of the main claim of the patent, which on the one hand is not deplaced from its correct position between the two sealing surfaces by the forces to which the gasket is subjected when the sealing surfaces are axially displaced to the jointed position in which the gasket is sealingly compressed between the sealing surfaces, and on the other hand can adapt to different widths of the gap between the sealing surfaces without causing the sealing pressure to be increased or decreased to an unacceptable value. The correct position of the gasket during the jointing of the sealing surfaces shall be maintained also in the case that the sealing surfaces are in a somewhat eccentric position in relation to each other when being axially displaced so as to provide the joint. An eccentric position between the sealing surfaces during assembly means that the width of the gap is different at different points around the gap so that the gap has a minimum width at one point and from this point successively increases its width to the diametrically opposite point at which the gap is of maximum width. In a gasket having a connection part extending substantially perpendicular to the axis of the gasket a force acting on the gasket when the sealing surfaces are being assembled will subject the gasket to a force striving to rotate the profile of the gasket at least at some points thereof. It is possible to reduce and even solve this problem in a gasket having a connection part extending perpendicular to the axis of the gasket by increasing the dimension of the connection part in the axial direction of the gasket. However, an increased dimension in the axial direction of the gasket causes other drawbacks, such as reduced possibilities of adapting the sealing sleeve to different widths of the gap between the sealing surfaces. In a gasket of the type described in which the connection part extends substantially perpendicular to the axis of the gasket this can adapt to different widths of the gap only by a more or less high compression of the elastic material of the gasket in the radial direction of the profile thereof. Thus, the axial dimension of the connection part of a gasket according to DE C 1 055 460 represents a compromise, i.e. said dimension shall be large so as to avoid rotation of the profile of the gasket when the sealing surfaces are being assembled while said dimension shall be small for facilitating the adaption of the gasket to different widths of the gap between the sealing surfaces. In accordance with the present invention the problems of obviating a rotation of the profile of the gasket when the sealing surfaces are being assembled as well as the problem of adapting the gasket to gaps of different widths are solved by the fact that the gasket body has in cross section a Z type general configuration with the connection part extending obliquely from the point of attack of the sliding part to a supporting surface on an axially opposite edge of the attachment part at an angle of 45 or less in relation to the axially extending attachment part. This Z type configuration of the gasket including an obliquely extending connection part provides that the force acting on the gasket in the proximity of the point of attack when the sealing surfaces are being assembled does not subject the gasket to a force striving to rotate the profile of the gasket. In the gasket according to the present invention said force acts in the longitudinal direction of the connection part. The gasket according to the present invention can adapt to different widths of the gap between the sealing surfaces by a translational movement of the sliding part in relation to the attachment part without any change of the compression of the connection part but only by a deflection thereof. This means that there are in a gasket according to the present invention no contradictory demands with regard to the dimensions of the connection part. The invention is illustrated with reference to the drawings, in which, Fig. 1 is a section through a first embodiment of the gasket profile. This can be said to be constructed from three main elements. The attachment part 1, the sliding part 2 and an inclined connection part 3 therebetween. The attachment part 1 can have a special shape, so that it matches a groove or similar, adapted thereto, but generally it will have a width which is substantially larger than the height, and it will preferably have a concave abutment side and the surfaces 7 and 8 with abrupt corners. The sliding part 2 shall have a concave surface 4. The surface can be evenly curved or for example consist of several inclined surfaces. The end surfaces 5 and 6 should preferably define acute angles together with the surface 4 so as to provide outwardly protruding sealing lips. To facilitate the insertion of one of the sealing surface into the other, the sliding part has an inclined position relative to the attachment part 1, so that the gasket height c is substantially less than the gasket height d. The connection part 3 is attached to the sliding part 2 at the front edge of the gasket, in the proximity of the point of attack A and extends therefrom obliquely downwards toward the inner surface 7 of the attachment part 1 at an angle of 45 or less. The twisting force which acts upon the gasket in the proximity of A, will then via the connection part 3 be directed towards the supporting surface and the limiting surface 7 of the attachment part 1, so that the gasket will be given a pivot point close to B, and the connection part 3 which has a greater length than the pivot radius, will act as a thrust bar and prevent rotation of the profile. Fig. 2 is an axial cross section of the gasket mounted on the spigot end of a pipe 9. For the fixing of the gasket on the pipe this can be provided with a step 10. Onto the pipe 9 there is pushed another pipe 11 having a socket 12. The socket 12 has a somewhat larger diameter D then the diameter d of the gasket and is additionally provided with a radius of entrance 13. As the socket 12 is pushed onto the sliding part 2 of the gasket it will hit the inclined concave sliding surface 4 thereof. The connection part 3 has less sectional area than the attachment and sliding part 1 and 2, respectively, and the sliding part 2 will pivot thereabout close to the attachment point B, and since this point is at a maximum distance from the point of attack A, the efficiency of the pivoting movement which results in increased thickness will be at a maximum at the point of attack A. The sealing lips 5 and 6 will thereby be placed under sufficient sealing pressure even if the gap between the pipe 9 and the socket 12 is substantially larger than the nominal dimension thereof, as is illustrated in Fig. 3. Due to its structure the gasket can also be used even if the gap between the sealing surfaces is substantially narrower than predicted. The approximate Z shape of the profile will then, as illustrated in Fig. 4, be converted into a flat compressed Z shape, substantially by bending the material, and the sealing pressure will therefore not increase above acceptable values. Of course the gasket can also be used having the attachment part fixedly connected to a socket 14, as illustrated in Fig. 6, in which the spigot end 15 is pushed into the gasket. In Fig. 5, a method of manufacturing the socket of the pipe is illustrated in which the gasket is mounted and compressed on a construction mandrel 16 with its gliding part 2 in contact therewith, on the outside of which mandrel the socket 14 of the pipe thereafter is constructed. After cooling or curing the mandrel 16 is pulled out of the socket, whereby the gasket is released and takes the shape as illustrated in Fig. 6, the pipe then being ready for use. Since the gasket is to be used in such a sealing system, the gasket must be prevented from being stretched when being mounted outside the construction mandrel 16. The gasket must therefore be provided with a non stretchable reinforcement 17. If this has a diameter which is adapted to the circumstances, the gasket will take a prestressed and compressed position as illustrated in Fig. 5. As previously described the gasket will then regain its original shape as soon as the construction mandrel 16 is removed. In addition to its primary function to compress the profile , the external reinforcement ring 17 also constitutes a substantial expedient for improving the pipe structure. Because the reinforcement is designed to absorb the maximum gasket pressure which can develop, the designer of the pipe need no longer take into consideration the uncertainty of what load this will exert on the socket. The designer should therefore be able to reduce the dimensions of the materials considerably since he need only take into account the transverse forces and similar forces which influence the socket. In use a gasket as illustrated in Fig. 1 must be provided with an appropriate lubricant on the surface 4 before assembly. To avoid this the gasket can be provided with a closed sliding jacket of the type described in U.S. Patent Specification No. 4 299 399. Such a closed jacket, during assembly, slides across the sliding surface of the gasket body and forms a double supporting layer in continuation of the gasket. Especially when the gasket is mounted on a construction mandrel, it must be compressed strongly, which may be disadvantageous primarily because this may make it difficult to mount on the construction mandrel. In such a case it would be more convenient if the gasket could have its thickness of material increased, and thereby its compression during the assembly of the pipes. If a relatively long assembly movement can be accepted and if also there is enough gap space inside the body of the gasket, such a gasket thickness can be achieved by increasing the thickness of the sliding jacket towards its connection to the gasket body. The long sockets necessary for achieving anything substantial by this approach are however frequently not wanted, and a substantially larger increase of thickness can be achieved by modification of the closed sliding jacket. The sliding jacket 22, shown in Fig. 7, is provided with an increasing thickness, and is at its thickest end attached to the front side of the body, whereas the other end of the jacket 22, which preferably has a bulge 25, is attached to the point of attack A of the gasket body in such a manner that the bulge 25 obtains a diameter 26 which is less than the diameter 27 of the gasket body. The largest width of the sliding jacket extends forwardly and outwards towards the socket opening 28. The inner surfaces 29 of the sliding jacket, which may be equipped with locking ribs, are in known manner provided with a suitable lubricant. When the pipe 9 is pushed into the socket 14, it will hit the double sliding jacket 22 at the bulge 25 thereof, and this will follow the movement of the pipe inwardly along the gasket body 2, whereas the lubricated inner surfaces 29 will slide relative to each other, the jacket at the same time rolling across the gasket body and forming a double layer thereover. The thickness of the material and the compression will then increase corresponding to two jacket thickness dimensions in the sealing gap. By adapting the width of the sliding jacket and the length of the assembly movement it is also possible to achieve a supporting layer 30 31, shown in Fig. 8, which may extend beyond the sealing width 32 in one or both directions. The jacket 22 may alternatively be of such a width that on being inserted by the pipe 9 a double jacket layer 20 forms only across the sealing width 32, so that the gasket can also be used even if no space is available inside the sealing gap, as illustrated in Fig. 9.
