# A method for forming a braking piston for a disc brake.

## Abstract
A method is provided for forming a braking piston for a disc brake of the type which includes a disc mounted for rotation about an axle. A brake housing is mounted on the axle in alignment with a friction surface of the disc. The piston has an interior end at least partially mounted within the housing and an external end outwardly of the housing adjacent the friction surface of the disc for axial movement toward and away from the disc. A flexible boot is secured to the housing and has an end extending into a circumferential channel around the piston. The housing has a plurality of first axially extending splines around an interior cylindrical surface thereof. The method includes the steps of providing the piston with an interior end having a cylindrical outer surface and forming a cylindrical groove thereabout. A plurality of second axially extending splines are shaped in the external surface of the piston to match the first splines of the housing with the second splines terminating at the circumferential groove. A ring element is formed of resilient, hard plastic the ring element in the circumferential groove with a first side toward the splines and the second side separated from the remainder of the groove to define the circumferential channel therebetween.
