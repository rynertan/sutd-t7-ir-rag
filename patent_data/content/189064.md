# Swirl chamber arrangement for diesel engine or the like.

## Abstract
In a pre chamber type diesel engine, in order to prevent droplets of liquid fuel finding their way into zones of the main combustion chamber 108 wherein they undergo slow combus tion and thus tend to form smoke, a recess 120 is formed at the main combustion chamber end of an auxiliary transfer passage 114 in a manner to provide a wall section 122 which deflects droplets of fuel, which have passed through the auxiliary passage during the induction phase and or initial stage of the compression phase, in a manner that they do not escape toward the perimeter of the piston crown and remain in a zone through which the flame produced by spontaneous combustion of the highly compressed airfuel mixture in the pre chamber 112 passes thus ensuring rapid vaporization and subsequent oxidation.
