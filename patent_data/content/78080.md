# A method and apparatus for dredging rock.

## Abstract
A method for breaking out rock from a rock bottom under water, in which a cutting means having at least one pick 1 is moved through the rock bottom. During the cutting procedure at least one water jet is directed from a nozzle 4 towards the desintegrating zone in front of the pick rake surface 1a wherein the starting energy of the jet is selected relative to the distance to be traversed through the water and relative to the nozzle diameter to such an extent that a cavitation cone forms around the water jet which continues up to the point where the jet hits the rock bottom.
