# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR USE IN PRODUCTION LINES

## Abstract
The invention relates to apparatus for operating on at least one article of a plurality of articles which are being continuously transported in succession along a path. A car shell 1 moves along a conveyor belt 2 in the direction from right to left as shown in the Figure. When the car shell moves adjacent the apparatus 4, slide legs 8 are urged to move upwards by, for example, pistons. Conse quently, the car body is engaged by holding means 30 provided at the top of slide legs and lifted clear of jig posts 3 which support the car shell on the conveyor belt. Thereafter, the rectangular support structure 10 which supports the slide legs 8 is moved in a leftward direction as shown in the Figure to move the car shell to the position indicated by a dotted line. At this position, means are ar ranged to operate on the car body shell, for example a glazing robot. After completion of the operation the support structure 10 can be lowered so that the car body shell again comes into contact with the conveyor belt 2 . By arranging the horizontal movement of the car shell to advance the shell relative to its original position on the track, it is possible for an operation to be carried out on the shell and thereafter to replace the shell onto the original, now moved, location on the track. In this way, it is unneces sary to have robots operating on the shell moving at the same speed as the track.
