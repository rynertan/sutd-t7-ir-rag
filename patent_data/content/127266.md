# Power transmission chain belt.

## Abstract
A power transmission chain belt, especially adapted to transmit power between the pulleys of a pulley transmission, such as a variable ratio pulley transmission. The chain belt is constructed of a plurality of ranks or sets 32, 36 of inter leaved links 34 , each rank being joined to the next adjacent rank by pivot means 40 , such as round pins, or a pin and rocker, to permit articulation of the belt. Trapezoidal load blocks 44 carried by the chain have angled edge surfaces 48 to drivingly contact the flanges of the pulleys. In one embodi ment of the invention, a block is located between each adja cent pair of pivot means and at least one block 45 has a different width than the other load blocks 44 , so that its edges 50 are free of contact with the flanges of the pulleys and thus do not drivingly engage the flanges. Substantially the same effect is achieved by skipping one or more load blocks in the assembly, i.e. by eliminating one or more load blocks in the chain belt. These arrangements change the generated noise pattern produced when the chain belt engages the pulley flanges.
