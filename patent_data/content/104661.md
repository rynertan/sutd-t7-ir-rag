# SCATTERING CELLS

## Abstract
A scattering cell can contain a sample whose scattering properties upon irradiation are measurable by a detector. The cell includes a central body having an input and output side spanned by a sample cavity. The cell also has an input window bordering the sample cavity on the input side. Also included is a prismatic output window bordering the sample cavity on the output side. This output window is operable to refract its incident radiation and vary the angle between its incident and transmitted radiation as a function of its angle of incidence.
