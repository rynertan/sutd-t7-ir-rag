## Description
Plastics tubing This invention is concerned with plastics tubing and its manufacture. Plastics tubing, in particular flexible PVC tubing, is used widely in many industries including applications in which contamination of fluids flowing through the tubing by toxic contaminants is unacceptable or highly undesirable. Examples of such applications are in brewing, biological and chemical processes, and especially in the field of medicine. Although other materials are available, polyvinyl chloride PVC tubing is most popular for medical use because it is clear and it is substantially cheaper. As a necessity, all PVC tubing currently available including that of medical grade, includes plastic isers, generally dethyl hexyl phthalate D.E.H.P. which is known to be very toxic, or in other cases Trimellitate which is less toxic but 5 more expensive. It is also known that plasticisers, fillers or other additives included in PVC material tend to seep from the surface of the material and a fluid flowing over the comparatively rough inside surface of an extruded PVC tube may easily become contaminated with the additives. D.E.H.P. is frequently found in the blood of patients on dialysis.Furthermore, the toxity of PVC is actually increased if it is subject to sterilisation by gamma radiation or ethylene oxide gas, which are commonly used methods. Thus the use of PVC tubing including toxic additives is potentially dangerous in medical equipment. The present invention seeks to provide a solution to the above problem associated with PVC tubing and in accordance with the invention there is provided flexible tubing comprising a main wall portion of polyvinyl chloride PVC , characterized in that a thin continuous layer of silicone rubber is firmly bonded to the whole of the inner surface of the main wall portion. The silicone rubber material, e.g. polydimethylsiloxane, and is preferably bonded to the PVC by a direct chemical linking obtained by applying the silicone to thePVC during extrusion of the latter. In this way a strong bond between the material is achieved through a copolymerisation of the PVC and silicone layers at their interface. The silicone layer may be very thin, e.g. only a few molecules or microns thick, so that the composite tubing can be substantially transparent, and still provide an effective barrier to prevent toxic additives included in the PVC contaminating fluid flawing through the tubing.The strength of the bonding between the material is believed to be responsible for the efficiency of the barrier provided by the thin silicone layer. The invention also provides a method of making a composite plastics tubing, including the step of forming a main wall portion of the PVC, characterized in that a thin layer of silicone rubber is then formed on the whole of the inner surface of the main wall portion. In a preferred manufacturing process to ensure a good chemical bond between the PVC and silicone layers a partially cured solution of polydimethysiloxane is atomised and sprayed onto the inside of the tube as it leaves the extruder outlet and before the polymerisation of the PVC is completed so that a co polymerisation of the two layers is achieved. Applying the silicone to the tube at a distance of about 0.2 to 0.5 cms from the outlet of the extruder has been found suitable. The silicone polydimethylsiloxane may be dissolved in a solvent having a boiling point up to 1700C, e.g. toluene and preferably crude n hexane fractions such as ESSO 10 boiling range 500 to over 1100C. According to the invention there is provided also an apparatus for making the composite tubing, comprising an extrusion press having an annular extrusion outlet, characterized by a spray nozzle positioned close to the extrusion outlet downstream thereof and operative to direct fine spray of silicone rubber in solution against the interior surface of the main wall portion as it leaves the extrusion outlet. In a preferred form, the nozzle comprises a plurality of outlet orifices spaced apart around the nozzle and inclined rearwardly towards the extrusion outlet. The orifices may be staggered in the axial direction and extend spirally outwardly from a central passageway with a view to increasing turbulence within the tube and hence ensuring a uniform layer of silicone deposited on the interior of the extruded tube. A full understanding of the invention will be had from the following detailed description given with reference to the accompanying drawing in which Figure 1 is a schematic illustration of an extruder embodying the invention Figure 2 is an enlarged scale section taken along the ine II 1I in Figure 1 and Figure 3 is a view similar to Figure 2 and showing a modified nozzle. The extruder shown in Figure 1 is illustrated schematically in axial cross section. It comprises an annular extrusion outlet defined between an outer die or body 1 and an inner core 2. The core has an axial air duct 3 the inlet end of which is connected to a source A of compressed air and at B to an atomiser not shown , for example of the ultrasonic type which atomises a solution of polydimethylsiloxane in toluene. Alternatively, a so called airless spray gun may be employed. Fixed to the end of the core 2 and commun3cating with the air duct 3 is a nozzle 4 made of metal or plastics. The nozzle has a central passage 5 which is closed at its outer end and from which radiate several orifices 6 which are inclined rearwardly towards the extrusion outlet.The outlets from the nozzle are preferably located at a distance of about 0.2. cms to 0.5 cms from the extruder outlet. As shown inFigure 1 adjacent orifices may be staggered along the nozzle to enable a greater number of orifices to be located around the nozzle periphery for producing a more uniform spray of silicone solution at the interior of the tube.The nozzle surface is spaced from the inside of the extruded tube by a clearance preferably not less than 1 5 of the diameter of the extrusion. In operation the extruder extrudes a continuous tube 8 of PVC material. Compressed air and atomised partially cured polydimethylsiloxane solution are supplied to the air duct 3 and a spray of the solution is directed towards the inside of the extruded tube through the orifices 6 of the nozzle 4. The polydimethylsiloxane is deposited on the inside of the tube as a continuous substantially uniform film 9 and its polymerisation is completed at the same time as that of the PVC so that a strong bond is obtained between the two layers by virtue of their co polymerisation. To aid the chemical bonding it is of advantage to allow the composite tubing product to run a little longer than usual before cooling. The nozzle orifices 6 may be adapted to enhance the atomisation of the silicone in order to obtain a more homogenous spray and hence a more uniform coating around the periphery of the PVC tube. In the modified nozzle shown in Figure 3 the orifices 6 extend spirally for producing a swirling spray also with a view to improving the uniformity of the silicone layers. The solvent vapour which is retained in the tubing can be removed by blowing through with filtered air and it can be recovered for re use if desired. It is possible that the need for subsequent sterilisation of the composite tubing may be eliminated by incorporating a bacterial filter at the inlet of the air duct.
