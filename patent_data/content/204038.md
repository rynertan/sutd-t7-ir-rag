## Description
The present invention relates to a method of operating a secondary battery to recondition it, involving repeated charge and discharge cycles, in which zinc Zn is used as the negative electrode active material. Examples of secondary batteries using zinc Zn as the negative electrode active material include a zinc bromine, zinc chlorine, nickel zinc, air zinc battery etc. The operation of this type of secondary battery is effected by a complete discharge method which is intended to completely dissolve the zinc on the negative electrode for the purpose of increasing the charge and discharge battery life. With this complete discharge operation, the secondary battery is discharged until the battery voltage and the load current are substantially reduced to zero. However, even if the complete discharge operation is performed, the zinc on the negative electrode is not completely dissolved and some of the zinc remains on the negative electrode. As a result, when the charge of the next cycle is effected, more zinc is electrodeposited on the zinc remaining on the negative electrode. Depending on the conditions, this electrodeposition of the zinc takes the form of an abnormal electrodeposition in the form of a dendrite. Thus, if the abnormal electrodeposition causes the zinc to extend to the positive electrode, this gives rise to a problem of battery short circuit. Moreover, where the battery has a large size and a large capacity, the above mentioned complete discharge operation consumes a large amount of electric power wastefully. The article in Journal of the Electrochemical Society, Vol. 115, No. 10 of October, 1968 pages 985 to 990 discloses a method for increasing the discharge capacity of an alkaline storage battery, especially those having silver and zinc electrodes. In one form pulses of charge are applied over a constant charging current. A reverse charge is superimposed over the charging current at intervals of between 1 minute and 4 hours. Patent Abstracts of Japan, Vol. 6, No. 243 E 145 1121 02.12.1982 relating to JP A 57143273 discloses a capacity restoring method for a lead acid battery. The polarity of the terminal voltage is reversed through compulsory discharge when the capacity of the battery is extremely low. Following the discharge compulsory charge is carried out at a constant current. GB A 1599076 discloses, as a background to apparatus for recharging dry electric power cells, a negative discharging current which is applied to a dry cell to polish the zinc electrode to improve the surface layer in between recharges. This is used to improve the recharging. It is an object of the present invention to prevent the occurrence of any abnormal electrodeposition of zinc during the charging of a secondary battery. It is another object of the invention to increase the charge and discharge cycle life of a secondary battery. It is still another object of the invention to ensure sufficient use of the electric power of a secondary battery. According to the present invention there is provided a method of operating a secondary battery 10 to recondition the battery, in which the secondary battery includes at least one unit cell using zinc as an active material for the negative electrode 10M in an electrolyte and which is adapted to be charged and discharged repeatedly, the method comprising the steps of During the reversed charge, and preferably also the reversed discharge, the energy generated from the secondary battery is preferably regenerated by means which is capable of converting the d.c power to a stepped up a.c. power. The above and other objects, features and advantages, of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description taken with the accompanying drawings. The invention may be carried into practice in various ways, but certain specific embodiments thereof will now be described by way of example only and with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which While the secondary battery operating method of the present invention is susceptible of being employed in numerous physical embodiments, depending upon the environment and requirements of use, substantial numbers of the herein shown and described embodiments have been made, tested and used, and all have performed in an eminently satisfactory manner. Firstly, the conventional secondary battery operating method will be described with reference to Figs. 1 and 2 of the accompanying drawings. Fig. 1 shows a circuit for effecting the complete discharge of a cell stack secondary battery 10. The secondary battery 10 is connected to a charging and discharging circuit which is not shown. The charging and discharging circuit includes a load which is supplied with the power from the secondary battery 10. In Fig. 1, the secondary battery 10 is shown connected to a series circuit of a switch 12 and a resistor 14. Referring now to Fig. 2, there are illustrated respectively in the characteristics A and B variations in the voltage and current of the secondary battery 10 when its charge, discharge and said complete discharge are effected. Shown at C are the modes of operation of the secondary battery 10. In Fig. 2, A to C , the secondary battery 10 is charged from a time t₁ to a time t₂ by the charging and discharging circuit which is not shown. During the time interval from t₂ to t₃, the charging and discharging circuit is opened. During the time interval from t₃ to t₄, the power is supplied to the load from the secondary battery 10 through the charging and discharging circuit and the secondary battery 10 is discharged. During the interval from t₄ to t₅, the charging and discharging circuit is again opened. Then, during the interval from t₅ to t₆, the complete discharge of the secondary battery 10 is effected. The switch 12 shown in Fig. 1 is turned on first at the time t₅. This operation connects the positive and negative electrodes of the secondary battery 10 to the resistor 14 and the complete discharge of the secondary battery 10 is started. Upon the discharge, the battery voltage gradually decreases as shown in A in Fig. 2, and also the battery current decreases gradually as shown in B . The battery voltage and current of the secondary battery 10 become substantially equal to zero at the time t₆. At the time t₆, the complete discharge operation is completed and the charge of the next cycle is started. In the case of a secondary battery using zinc as the negative electrode active material, generally the zinc deposits on the negative electrode during the charge, and upon the discharge the zinc on the negative electrode is dissolved into the electrolyte. When the complete discharge is effected, the whole zinc on the negative electrode must be dissolved into the electrolyte. However, even if the battery voltage of the secondary battery is reduced to zero as a result of the complete discharge, some of the zinc on the negative electrode is not dissolved completely into the electrolyte. Therefore, when the charge of the next cycle is effected, the zinc is further electrodeposited on the remaining zinc on the negative electrode. If this electrodeposition of the zinc develops into an abnormal electrodeposition in the form of dendrite, then the battery is finally short circuited. On the other hand, if the complete discharge of a large capacity secondary battery is effected, a considerable amount of electric power is wasted. Referring now to Figs. 3 to 6, a description will be made of a novel and improved secondary battery operating method embodying the invention which has overcome the foregoing disadvantages of the conventional operating method. Fig. 3 shows an exemplary circuit for performing an operating method according to a first embodiment of the invention. In the Figure, a cell stack secondary battery 10, which in this case uses zinc as the negative active material, has a positive electrode 10P connected to a contact 16A of a switch 16. A negative electrode 10M of the secondary battery 10 and the other contact 16B of the switch 16 are connected to a polarity reversing switch 18. The polarity reversing switch 18 includes fixed contacts 18A, 18C, 18D and 18F, and ganged movable contacts 18B, 18E. The fixed contacts 18A and 18F are interconnected and the fixed contacts 18C and 18D are interconnected. The contact 16B of the switch 16 is connected to each of the fixed contacts 18C and 18D of the polarity reversing switch 18. The negative electrode 10M of the secondary battery 10 is connected to each of the fixed contacts 18A and 18F of the polarity reversing switch 18. The contact 18B of the polarity reversing switch 18 is connected to a negative terminal 20M of a d.c. power source 20. Also, the contact 18E of the polarity reversing switch 18 is connected to a positive terminal 20P of the d.c. power source 20. In the polarity reversing switch 18, the contact 18B can be engaged with either of the contacts 18A and 18C. Also, the contact 18E can be engaged with either of the contacts 18D and 18F. The interengagements of these contacts are made in an interlocked manner. When the contact 18B is engaged with the contact 18A, the contact 18E is engaged with the contact 18D thus, the positive electrode 10P of the secondary battery 10 is connected to the positive terminal 20P of the d.c. power source 20 and the negative electrode 10M of the secondary battery 10 is connected to the negative terminal 20M of the d.c. power source 20. On the other hand, when the contact 18B of the polarity reversing switch 18 is engaged with the contact 18C, the contact 18E is engaged with the contact 18F thus, the positive electrode 10P of the secondary battery 10 is connected to the negative terminal 20M of the d.c. power source 20 and the negative electrode 10M of the secondary battery 10 is connected to the positive terminal 20P of the d.c. power source 20. The polarity reversing switch 18 can also be set into an open position in which its movable contacts 18B and 18E are out of engagement with all of the fixed contacts 18A, 18C, 18D and 18F. It is to be noted that the secondary battery 10 is also connected to a charging and discharging circuit which is not shown. The charging and discharging circuit includes a load which is supplied with the power from the secondary battery 10. The operating method according to the first embodiment will now be described with reference to Fig. 3 as well as Figs. 4 A to C . Fig. 4 A shows variations in the battery voltage of the secondary battery 10 when the operating method of the embodiment is performed. Shown in B are variations in the battery current of the secondary battery 10 in the similar case. Also, shown in C are the modes of operation in the similar case. The charge of the secondary battery 10 is effected first during the interval from t₁₀ to t₁₁ in Fig. 4. This charge is effected with a constant voltage e Then, during the interval from t₁₂ to t₁₃, the secondary battery 10 is discharged by the charging and discharging circuit which is not shown. In this period, the discharge current flows constantly throughout the period, and the discharge voltage remains essentially constant until the final stage of the period and then decreases gradually by a small amount, and the power is supplied to the load. This discharge voltage is lower than the open battery voltage e Then, during the interval from t₁₃ to t₁₄, the discharge is terminated and the charging and discharging circuit is again opened. In this period, the open battery voltage e Then, during the interval from t₁₄ to t₁₅, the reversed charge of the secondary battery 10 is effected. Firstly, at the time t₁₄, the polarity reversing switch 18 is operated to engage contact 18B with contact 18C, and to engage contact 18E with contact 18F. Then, the switch 16 is turned on. As a result of these switching operations, the positive electrode 10P of the secondary battery 10 is connected to the negative terminal 20M of the d.c. power source 20 and the negative electrode 10M of the secondary battery 10 is connected to the positive terminal 20P of the d.c. power source 20 thus, the reversed charge of the secondary battery 10 is effected. When the reversed charge is being effected, the battery voltage e At the time t₁₅, the battery voltage e At the time t₁₆, the battery voltage e As described hereinabove, in this embodiment the reversed charge of the secondary battery 10 is effected after the termination of its normal discharge. This reversed charge reverses the polarities of the electrodes 10P and 10M of the secondary battery 10. As a result, the zinc remaining on each negative electrode of the cell stack secondary battery 10 upon the termination of the normal discharge at the time t₁₃ is completely dissolved into the electrolyte by the reversed charge. Thereafter, the reversed discharge is effected and the secondary battery 10 is restored to the normal polarity and state. It is to be noted that in accordance with the present embodiment the open circuit mode t₁₆ to t₁₇ exists between the reversed discharge mode and the normal charge mode as shown in Fig. 4 C . However, this open circuit mode is not especially required at all time. Therefore, it is possible to arrange so that the normal charge of the secondary battery 10 is started at the time t₁₆. Also, where the cell stack secondary battery is of the electrolyte circulation type the electrolyte circulating pumps may be stopped during the operation in the reversed charge mode and the reversed discharge mode, respectively. If the electrolyte circulating pumps are stopped, the electrolytes in all the unit cells of the secondary battery 10 are made stationary. For example, the electrolyte circulating pumps which are not shown are stopped at the time t₁₄ in Fig. 4 and the operation of the pumps is restarted at the time t₁₇. The reversed charge and discharge operations are performed for every normal charge and discharge cycle of the secondary battery 10 or at intervals of several cycles. Enumerated below are the results of tests made by applying the operating method of the above mentioned embodiment to a zinc bromine battery 24 bipolar cells stacked secondary battery having each effective electrode area of 750 cm² and subjected to an 8 hour charge with a charging current of 15A and an average voltage of 46.5 V and then to a discharge with a discharge current of 13A until the battery voltage decreased to 24V , and the results obtained were satisfactory in all the cases. Next, a second embodiment of the invention will be described with reference to Figs. 5 and 6. Fig. 5 shows an exemplary circuit for performing an operating method according to the second embodiment of the invention. In the Figure, a secondary battery 10 is connected to an a.c. d.c. converter circuit 22 including a step up and step down circuit hereinafter simply referred to as a.c. d.c. converter circuit . The a.c. d.c. converter circuit 22 is also connected to a series circuit of a switch 24 and an a.c. power source 26. Connected to the a.c. d.c. converter circuit 22 are a battery voltage detecting circuit 28, a battery current detecting circuit 30 and a control circuit 32. The control circuit 32 controls the operation of the a.c. d.c. converter circuit 22 in accordance with the detection signals from the battery voltage detecting circuit 28 and the battery current detecting circuit 30. Next, the operating method according to the second embodiment will be described with reference to Fig. 5 and Figs. 6 A to C . Figs. 6 A to C show the battery voltage e Firstly, during the interval from t₂₀ to t₂₁ in Fig. 6, the switch 24 is turned on and the charge of the secondary battery 10 is effected. The a.c. power from the a.c. power source is converted to a d.c. power by the a.c. d.c. converter circuit 22. The charge of the secondary battery 10 is effected by this d.c. power. The charging voltage and the charging current during the charge are respectively detected by the battery voltage detecting circuit 28 and the battery current detecting circuit 30. In response to the detection signals, the control circuit 32 controls the a.c. d.c. converter circuit 22. This control maintains the charging voltage and the charging current at the desired values as shown in Figs. 6 A and B , respectively. During the interval from t₂₁ to t₂₂, the switch 24 is turned off and an open circuit condition is established. It is to be noted that this open circuit mode is not always required. Then, during the interval from t₂₂ to t₂₃, the switch 24 is again turned on and the secondary battery 10 is discharged. The d.c. power from the secondary battery 10 is stepped up and converted to an a.c. power by the a.c d.c. converter circuit 22. Alternatively, the d.c. power is converted to an a.c. power and then stepped up. Thus stepped up a.c. power is returned to the a.c. power source 26 or regenerated. The current flowing to the a.c. power source 26 during the discharge is detected by the battery current detecting circuit 30. In response to the detection signal, the control circuit 32 controls the a.c. d.c. converter circuit 22. As a result of this control, the current flowing to the a.c. power source 26 is controlled at the desired value. During, the interval from t₂₃ to t₂₄, the switch 24 is again turned off and the open circuit state is established. Then, during the interval from t₂₄ to t₂₆, the reversed charge of the secondary battery 10 is effected. In this reversed charge mode, the battery a.c. d.c. converter circuit 22 is connected to the secondary battery 10 in opposite polarity relation with each other. In other words, the secondary battery 10 and the a.c. d.c. converter circuit 22 are connected opposite in polarity to the connections during the charge in the interval from t₂₀ to t₂₁. As a result of this reversed charge, the battery voltage e Then, during the interval from t₂₆ to t₂₈, the reversed discharge of the secondary battery 10 is effected. In this reversed discharge mode, the terminal connections between the a.c. d.c. converter circuit 22 and the secondary battery 10 are interchanged. In other words, the secondary battery 10 and the a.c. d.c. converter circuit 22 are connected in the same polarity relation as in the case of the charge during the interval from t₂₀ to t₂₁. As a result of this reversed discharge, the battery voltage e Thus, at the time t₂₈, the battery voltage e Fig. 7 shows a detailed example of the embodiment shown in Fig. 5. In Fig. 7, the a.c. d.c. converter circuit 22 includes first and second converters 22A and 22B, a step up circuit 22c and a d.c. reactor 22D. Of these component parts, each of the converters 22A and 22B comprises switching elements such as thyristors or transistors arranged in a three phase bridge connection. This connection is generally referred to as a thyristor Ward Leonard type. The first and second converters 22A and 22B are connected so that they are opposite in polarity to each other, that is, they are arranged in an inverse parallel connection. The converters 22A and 22B are connected to the a.c. power source 26. In this embodiment, the a.c. power source 26 comprises a three phase power source. The battery voltage detecting circuit 30 includes two current transformers 30A and a converter 30B. The current transformers 30A are each provided in respective phases of a line for supplying the three phase a.c. current to the a.c. d.c. converter circuit 22. Each current transformer 30A detects the current flowing in one phase of the supply line. In other words, a current proportional to the current flowing in the three phase a.c. supply line is supplied to the converter 30B from each current transformer 30A. The converter 30B converts the value of the applied current to a form suitable for the control by the control circuit 32 and applies the resulting detection signal to the control circuit 32. The control circuit 32 incudes a setting means 32A, a battery voltage controlling amplifier 32B, a battery current controlling amplifier 32C, a gate controller 32D and signal generator 32E. of these component parts, the setting means 32A is provided to preset a desired charged voltage value of the secondary battery 10. A suitable voltage is applied to a terminal 32F and this voltage is divided by a variable resistor thereby presetting the desired charged voltage value. This desired charged voltage value is applied to comparing means 32G. Also applied to the comparing means 32G is the detected value of the battery voltage generated from the battery voltage detecting circuit 28. The detected value and the desired charged voltage value are compared by the comparing means 32G and the difference between the two is applied to the battery voltage controlling amplifier 32B. Then, the battery voltage controlling amplifier 32B applies its output to comparing means 32H. Also applied to the comparing means 32H is the detection signal generated from the converter 30B of the battery current detecting circuit 30. The comparing means 32H compares the inputs and the resulting difference is applied to the battery current controlling amplifier 32C. Then, the battery current controlling amplifier 32C applies its output to the gate controller 32D. The gate controller 32D applies a gate controlling signal or a gate signal to each of the converters 22A and 22B. The generation of the gate signals is controlled in accordance with the output from the signal generator 32E. More specifically, the phase of the gate signal is changed to effect the mode switching between the forward conversion and the inverse conversion operation of the converters 22A and 22B, respectively. In addition, the stopping of the conversion operations, etc., is also effected. The operation of the apparatus shown in Fig. 7 will now be described. This operation corresponds to a case where the operation shown in Fig. 6 is performed. Assume first that the gate signal generated from the gate controller 32D is controlled in accordance with the command generated from the signal generator 32E thus bringing the converter 22A into the forward conversion operation. As a result of the forward conversion operation, the a.c. power is converted to a d.c. power and the secondary battery 10 is charged. This period of operation corresponds to the interval between the times t₂₀ and t₂₁. During this interval, the battery voltage of the secondary battery 10 is compared with the desired charged voltage value by the comparing means 32G. The difference between the battery voltage and the desired charged voltage value is amplified by the battery voltage controlling amplifier 32B and it is then applied to the comparing means 32H. The comparing means 32H compares the applied difference signal with the detection signal from the battery current detecting circuit 30. The difference between the battery voltage and the detection signal from the battery current detecting circuit 30 is amplified by the battery current controlling amplifier 32C and then applied to the gate controller 32D. The applied difference signal controls the phase of a gate signal generated from the gate controller 32D. This control is effected so that the battery voltage of the secondary battery 10 attains the desired charged voltage value. Thus,as shown in the interval from t₂₀ to t₂₁ in Fig. 6, the secondary battery 10 is charged with a constant charging voltage and constant charging current. Then, at the time t₂₁, the signal generator 32E applies an open circuit command for the converter 22A to the gate controller 32D. This stops the application of the gate signal to the converter 22A by the gate controller 32D. As a result, the operation of the converter 22A is stopped. then, at the time t₂₂, the signal generator 32E applies an inverse conversion command for the converter 22B to the gate controller 32D. Thus, the gate controller 32D applies a gate signal to the converter 22B. When this occurs, the converter 22B starts its inverse conversion operation and the d.c. power from the secondary battery 10 is converted to an a.c. power. The converted a.c. power is sent back to the power source. Then, at the time t₂₃, the signal generator 32E applies an open circuit command for the converter 22B to the gate controller 32D. This stops the application of the gate signal to the converter 22B by the gate controller 32D. As a result, the operation of the converter 22B is stopped. Then, at the time t₂₄, the signal generator 32E applies a forward conversion operation command for the converter 22B to the gate controller 32D. Thus, the gate controller 32D applies a gate signal to the converter 22B. This gate signal differs in phase from the gate signal generated during the interval from t₂₂ to t₂₃. In other words, during the interval from t₂₂ to t₂₃ the control angle is a lead angle and the converter 22B is controlled correspondingly. On the other hand, during the interval from t₂₄ and on, the control angle is a lag angle thus correspondingly controlling the converter 22B. As a result of the forward conversion operation of the converter 22B, the reversed charge of the secondary battery 10 is effected. Then, when the battery voltage of the secondary battery 10 becomes e₂ at the time t₂₆, the signal generator 32E applies an open circuit command for the converter 22B to the gate controller 32D. At this time, the signal generator 32E also applies an operation command for the converter 22A to the gate controller 32D. consequently, the operation of the converter 22B is stopped and at the same time the operation of the converter 22A is started thus starting the reversed discharge of the secondary battery 10. Then, as the time t₂₈ is reached, the operation of the converter 22A is stopped in response to the command from the signal generator 32E. Note that the above mentioned operations are repeated on and after the time t₂₉. Fig. 8 shows another detailed example of the embodiment shown in Fig. 5. In Fig. 8, the a.c. d.c. converter circuit 22 comprises a thyristor Ward Leonard section 220, a step up circuit 222 and a change over switch section 224. The thyristor Ward Leonard section 220 includes converters 220A and 200B arranged in an inverse parallel connection. In this apparatus, the converter 220B operates in a different manner from that of the apparatus shown in Fig. 7. More specifically, the converter 220B performs only the inverse conversion operation and no forward conversion operation is performed. During the reversed charging of the secondary battery 10, the polarity change over by the changer over switch section 224 is effected and therefore the forward conversion operation of the converter 220B is not required. A smoothing capacitor 220B is connected across the battery voltage detection circuit. The change over switch section 224 is controlled by a switching controller 34. The step up circuit 222 is of the known type disclosed in Japanese Patent No. Publication No. 55 49519. Now beginning with a description of the step up circuit 222, a thyristor 222B which is in inverse parallel connection with a diode 222A is connected in series between d.c. reactors 220C and 222C. The thyristor 222B is connected with a polarity such that a current flows to the secondary battery 10 from the converters 220A and 220B, respectively. Connected to the cathode of the thyristor 222B is a thyristor 222E which is in inverse parallel connection with a diode 222D. The thyristor 222E is connected such that its anode is connected to the cathode of the thyristor 222B. The step up circuit 222 is controlled by a step up controller 36. The construction of the step up controller 36 is substantially the same as the construction of the control circuit 32 shown in Fig. 7. The step up controller 36 includes setting means 36A, a voltage controlling amplifier 36B, a current controlling amplifier 36C, a gate controller 36D and a signal generator 36E. A suitable voltage is applied to the setting means 36A from a terminal 36F. The step up controller 36 also includes comparing means 36G and 36H, a voltage detector 36I and a current detector 36J. The voltage detector 36I and the current detector 36J respectively detect the battery voltage and the battery current of the secondary battery 10. The control of the step up circuit 222 by the step up controller 36 will now be described briefly. This control is effected by controlling the duration in each of the alternately interchanging ON periods and OFF periods of gate signals which are applied to the thyristors 222B and 222E from the gate controller 36D in accordance with the command of said signal generator 36E. Specifically, with the thyristor 222B ON, the current flows through the converter 220A, the d.c, reactor 220C, the thyristor 222B, the d.c. reactor 222C and the secondary battery 10 sequentially. Under this condition, when the thyristor 222B is turned OFF, and ON gate signal is applied to the thyristor 222E even in this case, the thyristor 222E remains in OFF state, as will be described later , a high voltage of reverse polarity against the polarity shown in Fig. 8 is generated across both ends of d.c. reactor 222C due to the fact that the current flowing into the d.c. reactor 222C tends to keep flowing in the same direction. This reverse voltage causes the current to flow through a loop formed with the d.c. reactor 222C, the secondary battery 10 and the diode 222D. At this moment, a voltage drop occurs across both ends of said diode 222D. Since this dropped voltage has a reverse polarity in relation to the thyristor 222E, the thyristor 222E remains in OFF state no matter whether ON gate signal is applied thereto. Next, the current flowing through the diode 222D will not vanish rapidly, but will be reduced gradually to zero as time passes, depending on the amount of energy stored in the d.c. reactor 222C, and the terminal voltage of the secondary battery 10. At the zero level, the current will then flow reversely through a loop formed with the secondary battery 10, the d.c. reactor 222C and the thyristor 222E. Then, when the thyristor 222E is turned OFF and ON gate signal is applied to the thyristor 222B even in this case, the thyristor 222B remains in OFF state , the current flowing through the thyristor 222E is cut off, with the result that, similarly as mentioned above, a high voltage of same polarity against the polarity shown in Fig. 8 is generated across both ends of the d.c. reactor 222C, and causes the current to flow through a loop formed with the d.c. reactor 222C, the diode 222A, the d.c. reactor 220c, the converter 220B and the secondary battery 10. This current is reduced gradually to zero as time passes, and when the thyristor 222B is turned ON, the current flows in the reverse direction. In this manner, the thyristors 222B and 222E will repeat their respective ON OFF operation alternately. During this ON OFF repetitious operation, if the ON or OFF period of the thyristor 222B, for instance, is equal to the OFF period of the thyristor 222E, the mean value of the current id flowing through the d.c. reactor 222C is nil, but if the ON period of the thyristor 222E is longer than that of the thyristor 222B, the mean value of the current id becomes a negative value, in which case the current flows from the secondary battery side to the diode 222A side. Accordingly, in the case of the negative mean value of current id , the electric power is transferred from the secondary battery side to the converter 220B side, whereby the power regeneration is effected to the a.c. power source by means of the converter 220B. The following Table 2 shows the ON states of the converters 220A and 220B, the diodes 222A and 222D, the thyristors 222B and 222E and the change over switch section 224 during the respective operating modes shown in Fig. 6. As described hereinabove, In accordance with the second embodiment of Fig. 5 the a.c. d.c. converter circuit 22 is controlled such that after the normal discharge of the secondary battery 10 has been effected, the reversed charge of the secondary battery 10 is effected. Thus, the zinc remaining on each negative electrode of the cell stack secondary battery 10 after the normal discharge is completely dissolved into the electrolyte by virtue of the reversed charge. It is to be noted that in accordance with the second embodiment the use of the open circuit condition during the interval from t₂₈ to t₂₉ is arbitrary optional . Also, in the case of an electrolyte circulation type cell stack secondary battery, electrolyte circulating pumps are also stopped as previously during the reversed charge and the reversed discharge. In the second embodiment, the reversed charge and discharge operations may be performed for every charge and discharge cycle of the secondary battery 10 or at intervals of several cycles. Enumerated below are the results of tests made by applying the operating method of the above mentioned second embodiment to a zinc bromine battery 24 bipolar cells stacked secondary battery having each effective electrode area of 750 cm² and subjected to an 8 hour charge with a charging current of 15A and average charging voltage of 46.5V and then to a discharge with a discharge current of 13A until the battery voltage decreased to 24V , and the results obtained were satisfactory in all the cases. It is to be noted that in the tests, the voltage of the a.c. power source 26 was 200V and the a.c. d.c. converter circuit 22 comprised an inverse parallel connected circuit of a step up circuit and a thyristor Ward Leonard section as disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 55 49519. Also, the battery current detecting circuit 30 detected the currents corresponding to the charging and discharging d.c. current values in the form of alternating currents. From the foregoing it will be seen that in accordance with the second embodiment the energy stored in the secondary battery is regenerated or returned to the a.c. power source even in the reversed charge and discharge modes and effective utilization of the energy is ensured. As described hereinabove, the secondary battery operating method of this invention has the effect of satisfactorily preventing the occurence of abnormal electrodeposition of zinc and increasing the charge and discharge cycle life of secondary batteries. As many apparently widely different embodiments of this invention may be made without departing from the scope thereof, it is to be understood that the present invention is not limited to the specific embodiments thereof except as defined in the appended claims.
