## Description
IMPROVED SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR HYDROPONICALLY GROWING PLANTS BACKGROUND OF TiE D ENT1ON Field of the neticn The present invention generally relates to an improved system and method for growing of plants, more particularly for hydroponically growing plants in the presence of controlled amounts of growth promoting gas.Prior Art The importance of oxygen for plant growth is of long standing knowledge. It has been observed that most plants cannot survive growing in stagnant oxygen depleted water. Plant and root infections increase when root aeration is restricted.Anaerobic conditions in the root medium result in rapid excretion of sugars, amino acids and carboxylic acids such compounds are known to adversely affect plant growth. A logarithmic relationship has been observed between growth of tomato plants and oxygen tension and a relationship has also been observed between nutrient absorption and the extent of aeration of the root medium. Most commercial hydroponic plant growino systems employing recirculating nutrient solutions are vulnerable to and frequently exhibit plant root oxygen deficits. If insufficient oxygen is supplied to the roots, nutrient solids uptake is reduced and toxic organic compounds are released into the solution by the roots. Buildup of nutrient compounds in recirculating nutrient solution may reach toxic levels. Increased root sloughing due to the toxic compounds released into the solution causes increased system biochemical oxygen demand and consequent further reduction of available oxygen levels. This situation can continue to the point of total root death. In any event, roots insufficiently supplied with oxygen exhibit increased susceptibility to root pathogens. Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide an improved system and method for hydroponically growing plants on a commercial basis with assurance of improved oxygen supplies to the root systems of te plants througnout the growing Tericd. Such oxygenation should be controlled to optimize plant growth. In some instances, it would also be important to be able to supply through such system and method another type of plant growth promoting gas such as carbon dioxide or ammonia. Preferably, the system and method should be adaptable to continuous usage in an automated or semi automated mode. SUMMARY OF ThE INVENTION The foregoing needs are satisfied by the improved system and method of the present invention. The system and method are substantially as set forth in the Abstract above. In the system and method, 2 pressure zone such as a pressure vessel preferably at superatmospheric pressure is provided wherein liquid plant growth nutrient solution is increased in total surface area by, for example, contacting it with a splash plate to form droplets, and while in such form contacted with a selected plant growth promoting gas such as air, oxygen, ammonia, carbon dioxide or mixtures thereof.The gas is dissolved in the liquid to a sub stantial extent and then the gas enriched liquid is delivered to the plants being hydroponically grown in the liquid. Gas depleted liquid may be returned from the plant growing area to the pressure vessel for regasification. If the gas is carbon dioxide or ammonia, the pH of the liquid is adjusted to a desired range before the liquid is passed to the plants. Sensor means such as a gas level sensing probe may be inserted in the liquid return line and connected to a solenoid operated valve in the gas supply line to automatically regulate the concentration of gas in the pressure vessel in accordance with the concentration of gas in the gas depleted hydroponic plant growing liquid returning to the vessel.All or a portion of the liquid may be periodically passed to a, cleanup facility to remove plant waste products and other imbalances and then returned to the system, and controlled amounts of fresh makeup liveid are added to the system to replace the liquid which is absorbed by the plants. The system and method are inexpensive, are easily automated for continuous or semi continuous use and are very efficient in promoting maximum hydroponic growth of plants. Further features of the present invention are set forth in the following detailed description and accompanying drawings. DRAWINGSFiqure 1 is a schematic flow diagram illustrating a preferred embodiment of the improved system of the present invention and,Figure 2 is a schematic side elevation, partly broken away, of a preferred embodiment of the pressure vessel utilized in Fig. 1. DETAILED DESCRIPTION Fig . 1 Now referring more particularly to Fig. 1 of the accompanying drawings, a schematic flow diagram of a preferred embodiment of the improved system of the present invention is set forth therein,Thus, system 10 is shown which comprises a storage or recirculation tank 12 rrom which a hydroponic plant growth liquid 32 which is a nutrient solution such as Hoagland s solution, a well recognized aqueous solution, is pumped via line 14 and pump 16 to a cylindrical gas pressure vessel 18.Line 14 passes into vessel 18 and terminates adjacent to a horizontally disposed splash plate 20 depending from the upper portion of vessel 18. liquid 32 exiting line 14 in vessel 18 is directed upwardly perpendicular against splash plate 20 with sufficient force to cause liquid 32 to break up into a plurality of fine droplets which gravitate downwardly in vessel 18 and are contacted by plant growth promoting gas in vessel 18 to increase the concentration of that gas in liquid 32. That gas is, as indicated previously, oxygen, air, ammonia, carbon dioxide or a mixture thereof and is introduced into vessel 12 through a line 22 having a valve 24 therein. Line 22 originates at a aas source 26 which may e a cpmpressor, compressed gas cylinder or the like. Pressure vessel 18 is provided with a vent line 28 having a valve 30 therein. The bottom portion of vessel 18 is shown with gas enriched hydroponic plant growing liquid 32 therein and is provided with a bottom liquid outlet line 26 which passes gassified liquid 32 from vessel 18 to a hydroponic plant growth area 38 containing a plurality of plants 40 growing in liquid 32. Thus, line 36 connects to a manifold 42 containing a plurality of capillary conduits 44 opening adjacent separate ones of plants 40, specifically adjacent the roots thereof. Plants 40 are disposed in troughs, tubs, containers or other enclosures not sho . and a plurality of exit lines 46 are connected thereto, which lines run to a return manifold 48 which connect to a return line 50.Return line 50 passes into storage tank 12. In Fig. 1, manifold 42 is shown with an end cap 52 which permits additional lines 44 and plants 40 to be added to area 38. Return line 50 has connected thereto a sensor 54 which detects the level of dissolved gas in the gas depleted hydroponic plant growing liquid 32 in line 50 and which passes a signal through line 56 to solenoid operated valve 24, to direct the opening and closing of that valve so as to control the concentration of gas passing through line 22 into pressure vessel 18.Thus, the regasification of gas depleted hydroponic plant growing liquid 32 in pressure vessel 18 can be automatically controlled by operation of sensor 54 and valve 24, If desired, a liquid bleed off or pump out line not shown and a makeup line for passage of fresh makeup liquid not shown can be provided in system 10 to replenish nutrients and liquid utilized by plants 40 and to permit removal from systen 10 cf plant te roducts anchor ur.ceslraDy G 9 6 of nutrient solids produced by long continued circulation of liquid 32 in system 10. It will be understood that, if desired, line 50 can pass all or part of depleted liquid 32 directly to waste, rather than back to tank 12 for return to vessel 18 and reuse. Fig. 2 Now referring more particularly to Fig. 2 of the accompanying drawings, the details of pressure vessel 18 and assorted equipment such as are utilized in system 10 are shown therein. As can be seen from Fig. 2, plant growth promoting gas is pumped by compressor 26 via line 22 through a filter pressure regulator unit 60.A pressure relief valve 62 is installed between compressor 26 and filter pressure regulator unit 60 to prevent failure of compressor 26 due to abnormal line blockage. After passing through unit 60, the purified gas is conducted through line 22, a valve sight flow indicator 64 and valve 24. As noted above, valve 24 may be connected to sensor 54 and be a solenoid operated valve for control by sensor 54. For such purposes it can be a proportionating valve or an on off valve. A check valve 66 may be placed in line 22 close to vessel 18 to prevent back flow in the case of failure of compressor 26 or the like. Compressed growth promoting gas is injected into vessel 18 near the top thereof through line 22, terminating just below horizontal splash plate 20 suspended by struts 68 from the roof 70 of vessel 18 in the interior thereof. Hydroponic plant growing liquid 32 is passed from tank 12 Fig. 1 to vessel 18 by inlet line 14 which terminates directly below plate 20 and which includes a nozzel 72. Nozzle 72 directs a stream of liquid 32 against plate 20 at about a right angle thereto so that a plurality of fine droplets of liquid 32 are formed. These droplets gravitate to the pool of liquid 32 in the bottom of portion 74 of vessel 18. A sight ssindoal 76 may be provided in the side of vessel 18 to visually observe the liquid level in vessel 18. As the droplets of liquid 22 descend in vessel 18 they are intimately contacted with the gas introduced into vessel 18 through line 22, preferably at substantially elevated pressure so that gasification of the droplets occurs rapidly. For example, when vessel 18 is operated at an internal pressure of about 23.5 25 psia utilizing air as the growth promoting gas, a dissolved oxygen level approximately 50 higher than the equilibrium oxygen level of the liquid at sea level can be maintained in the liquid so that the same amount of oxygen can be supplied to plants 40 Fig. 1 in 1 3 less liquid 32 than would other wise be required for hydroponic plant growing, thereby reducing liquid pumping requirements.It will be understood, however, that if desired, vessel 18 could be operated at atmospheric pressure and that gas supplied thereto through line 22 could also be at essentially atmospheric pressure. Pressure vessel 18 may be provided with a ring baffle 78 which reduces the amount of liquid 32 draining dotm the inner .. surface of the side walls of vessel 18. An anti vortex elf fluent baffle 80 maybe provided in the lower portion of vessel 18 to prevent undissolved gas from entering exit line 36. At the desired liquid level in pressure vessel 18 there may be provided an outlet gas port connected to vent line 28 in which are disposed valve 30,filter 82 and float valve 84. Float valve 84 provides venting of gases when the liquid level is below the float and provides a positive seal against loss of gases and hydroponic plant growing liquid 32 when the liquid level is above the float in that valve 84. Inasmuch as valve 84, at its equilibrium position, may tend to pass fluid droplets as well as gases, line 28 can, if desired, be shunted to reservoir 12 not shown .In addition, vessel 18 may be provided with a separate safety pressure relief valve 86 in a line 88 at the upper end of vessel 18 to prevent an explosion in the unlikely event of flow bloce or other abnormal conditions. The following specific ambles fs er lust ate .er features of the present invention. EXAMPLE I The system of Figs. 1 and 2 is utilized in practicing the present method. Thus, liquid 32 is Hoagland s solution disposed in circulation tank 12 and passed from that tank line 14 by pump 16 to pressure vessel 18 at a constant rate of 140 gallons per minute. Pressure vessel 18 is formed of polyvinyl chloride and has a height of 8 feet and an internal diameter of 36 inches.Line 14 is fitted with nozzle 72 and is set at a 900 angle to the horizontal surface of a 6 inch x 9 inch diameter polyvinyl chloride splash plate 20. Large numbers of small solution droplets are produced which come into contact with air being supplied to vessel 18 from compressor 26 through line 22 at the rate of one standard cubic foot per minute. The concentration of oxygen in the gas enriched solution 32 is about 12 ppm. This gas enriched liquid 32 is then conducted via bottom exit line 36 to a plurality of European cucumber plants 40, passing through manifold 42 and capillary feed tubes 44. Plants 40 are hydroponically grown in elongated troughs containing the nutrient solution 32. The combined effect of the oxygen takeup of plants 40, effervescence of liquid 32 and the biochemical oxygen demand of the system is a reduction of the solution oxygen level in liquid 32 to 7 ppm. After contact with the plant roots, nutrient solution 32 that portion not absorbed by the plants is collected by return lines 46, exit manifold 48 and return line 50 and is cqnducted in line 5C to recirculation tank 12. Gas depleted liquid 32 is then passed to vessel 18, regassified in the manner described above and then passed back to plants 40 for reuse. Thus, the system operates on a substantially continuous recycling basis. The oxygen level in gas depleted liquid 32 is sensed by an oxygen sensing probe 54 in line 50, which probe generates a signal transmitted via line 56 to solenoid actuated valve 24 in line 22 so as to control the flow of air into vessel 18 and thus the extent of re oxygenation of gas depleted liquid 32 in vessel 18. Maximum yields of fully grown cucumbers are obtained with a minimal amount of labor, time and cost utilizing the described method and system. The described system is operated in an almost fully automatic mode, requiring a minimal of super vision. Additional amounts of fresh liquid 32 are periodically added to the system to replace that portion of liquid 32 which is absorbed by plants 40. EXAMPLE II The system and method described in Example I utilizing the equipment depicted in Figs. 1 and 2 are employed in the hydroponic growing of tomato plants utilizing in paraliel tests Hoagland s solution and other aqueous solutions containing conventional hydroponic plant growth minerals in dissolved form. In each test pure oxygen from a compressed cylinder is substituted for air.Since partial pressure of oxygen in vessel 18 is 100 , the necessity to vent vessel 18, such as is required with air to reduce the nitrogen content of gases in vessel 18, is eliminated.Substantially all oxygen in vessel 18 eventually is dissolved in liquid. 32. The level of dissolved oxygen in liquid 32 is about 4.8 times greater than when air is used, as in Example I, for comparable pressures in vessel 18. Since oxygen is a major limiting growth factor, the pumping capacity to plants 40 is substantially reduced below the low levels required for Example I. In further parallel tests, it is demonstrated that various mixtures of air or oxygen, ammonia and or carbon dioxide are successfully used in the system and method of the present invention for gasification of liquid 32 and supply to plants 40 in order to stimulate full, rapid and proper hydroponic growth thereof. When ammonia or carbon dixoide is used, pH adjustments are made in liquid 32 through the addition thereto of suitable conventional acids, bases, acidic or basic salts, etc. Various other modifications, changes, alterations and additions can be made in the system of the present invention, its components and parameters and in the method of the present invention, its steps and parameters. All such changes, modifications, alterations and additions as are. within the scope of the present claims form part of the present invention.
