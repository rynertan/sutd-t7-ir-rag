# Gold metallisation in semiconductor devices.

## Abstract
Gold is preferred as the conductor material in metallisa tion layer 4 of a semiconductor device because of its high conductivity and freedom from electromigration effects but gold is inclined to diffuse into the semiconductor substrate 1 , typically silicon, so degrading the p n junction characteris tics within the semiconductor substrate and rendering the device inoperative. Previously this problem has been over come by placing a protective barrier layer of titanium 3 between the gold layer 4 and the substrate 1 . The gold titanium interface is subject to corrosion and this corro sion adjacent the substrate 1 contrining the active areas of the device also leads to failure of the device. This is prevented by covering the gold metallisation layer 4 of the device on its top 5 , bottom 3 and side surfaces 7 with titanium. This prevents the diffusion of the gold into any other layer 1, 2, 8 of the semiconductor device above or below it and there is no gold titanium interface exposed adjacent any active area of the device.
