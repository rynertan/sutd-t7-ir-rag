# Semiconductor module cooling structure.

## Abstract
A semiconductor module cooling structure comprises a housing 33 having a passage 45, 46 through which a cooling fluid flows a cooling block 72, 75 to which the cool ing fluid is supplied from the housing and which has an electrical insulating layer 36, 59 at the bottom portion and is combined with a semiconductor chip 40 through the electrical insulating layer and a bellows 34 which is con nected between the housing and the cooling block. The cooling fluid is supplied to the cooling block through the bel lows. The bellows is formed in a manner such that a plural ity of substantially plane ring like metal plates 4 are lami nated, pressed, diffused, joined, and thereafter stretched and molded.
