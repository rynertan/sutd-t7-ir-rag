## Description
DEVICE FOR THE ADJUSTMENT OF THE REFRIGERATiNG FLUID FLOW IN AN APPARATUS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF COLD OR HOT CONDITIONS AND SYSTEM FOR REGULATING SUCH FLUID FLOW.The present invention refers to a contrivance for the adjustment of the refrigerating fluid flow in an apparatus for the production of cold or hot conditions, and to a regulating system of the refrigerating fluid in a refrigerator comprizing at least two r freratir cells evidencing different temperatures, each of which is cooled through an evaporator through which the refrigerating fluid is flowing, one of the said cells being meant for fresh food, whilst the other is intended for frozen food, further a condenser for the condensation of refrigerating fluid from the compressor and a system of capillary tubes for the transfer of the refrigerating fluid from the condenser to the evaporators.It is known that in refrigerating circuits of household appliances the expansion valve was replaced by a capillary device, out of practical and money sparing reasons.This capillary device evidences however some weak sides, which are essentially due to its scarce flexibility and adaptability to the different load conditions and to the different ambient temperature. As a matter of fact under light loads or with by high ambient temperatures, it is possible that outflowing from thc evanorftor there could still be some refr ermting fluid in liquid conditions this determines 2 considerable lowering of t refrigerator s perforrnance and also tne buildin r tjp of hoarfrost on the backflo8piping of the refrigerating flow returning to the comprLssor it could even occur thet sone liquid penetrates into the compressor , damaging it. Un ier heavy load conditions, or when ambient temperature is low, it is possible on the contrary that in the last portion of the evaporator there remains some refrigerating fluid as saturated steam with a limited cooling power. Under such conditions there would be an insufficient cooling of the cell to be cooled.Furthermore the two doors refrigerators equipped with two cooling rooms , one for fresh foods and one for frozen ones cell freezer with a single compressor and only one refrigerating fluid circuit raise the problem that by regulating temperature in one of the two cells, temarature changes also in the other cell, automatically. This link creates problems when for instance one must lower the temperature in the freezer cell because some fresh food was introduced and iS to be frozen , whilst the temperature in the fresh food cell is on desired level and is not to be further lowered. In such cases it would be very appropriate to be able to adjust the refrigerating fluid flow. To this end one could use either an expansion valve replacing the capillary contrivance or an electro magnetic valve.However the expansion valves require a rather careful machining and are obtainable at high costs. The electro magnetic valves instead could be inserted and connected in series to the refrigeratin circuit or on a branch line raraAlel to the ev,norrtor. jn the first case n, considering that such valves have only two positions, one for opening and one for closing , regulation should occur through the opening and the closing of the valve in a ranid sequence and with the desired frequenc 7 however such a kind of operation would imply within a shout lapse of time a barrage to the valve in the second case regulation should occur through opening for a necessary lapse of time the valve normally closed in order to short the evaporator , which under such conditions would no longer cool the cell. But in this case it would be necessary to supply the refrigerating circuit w th an additional branch, thus increasing production costs.Considering that the two evaporators can be connected in series or in parallel, an independent functioning of the two cells can be obtained through two three or four way valves of the electromagnetic kind,connected in the refrigerating circuit and allowing the passing through, the stopping or the deviation of the refrigerating fluid in the two evaporators.For instance by blocking the flowing of the refrigerating fluid into the evaporator of the fresh foods cell, it is possible to defrost said cell and to freeze the frozen foods cell alone. Such electro magnetic valves involve however a notable drawback, especially in the case of refrigerating circuits of household appliances which are to be produced in large quantities and at limited prices, because they cost a lot and their use in fThe rea of said appliances ap.e rs problematical. Hn ther drawback in the refrigertors entior. d above after the stopping of the compressor i.e. during the equalization jf the refrigerating fluid pressures is due to the fact that se fluid during its transfer from the condenser to the evaporators conveys external heat and thus reises the tr,mperature of the evaporators,degrading them in consequence.The present invention aims therefore at the overcoming of the above drawbacks by building a contrivance for the regulation of the fluid flow in a refrigerating circuit at a very low cost, whilst in case of damage to the electrical component of the device coil this can be easily replaced without damaging the circuit of the refrigerating fluid. Another scope of the present invention consists in setting up a refrigerating combined apparatus or a two doors one, in which the operation of the two cells used for cooling purposes is to be substantially independent, whilst the regulating system of the refrigerating fluid is in conditions to warrant the re balancing of the pressures of the refrigerating fluid without degrading the evaporators. The device is finally to be notably money staring through the use of electric valves having a low cost level.To reach this target, the present invention proposes a contrivance for the regulation of the flow of a refrigerating fluid in an apparatus for the production of cold or heat, characterized by the fact that it comprizes rather simple and economic means for she re uletion of said flow, said ars PcJuding an electro magnetic valve inserted into a capillary tube forming nart of the circuit of the refrigerating fluid arid said electro rr.a,ne tic valve comprizing a movable component for the regulation of said flow, the position of which is controlled through an electric pulse addressed to the coil of said valve and through the fluid pressure. inside the capillary tube.Further scopes and advantages of the present invention will appear clearly from the detailed description hereinafter drawn up and the enclosed drawings, which are to be understood purely as examples without any specific limitation.We have here three figure in,which In the figure 1 appears a cross section of the first realization of the above mentioned contrilvance forming the subject of the present invention in the figure 2 appears schematically a refrigerator arranged according to the regulating system of the refrigerating fluid subject of the present invention and applying the device mentioned before and appearing on fig.1 and in the figure 3 there appears a cross section of a second form of realization of the contrivance covered by the present invention.With reference to figure 1 a cylindrical copper container 11 is shown, with two apertures 12 and 14 opened in its end portions. In the lower aperture 12 a first part 13 of a capillary tube 13 is inserted and welded , from which the refrigerating fluid flows into the evaporator. In the upper aper ure 4 a second part of the e lle c niltfry tube 13 is inserted .d welded it is bent so as to adhere t the container 11 ind to remain na allel to the first part 13 of the capillary tube ,frdm this part 15 arrives the refrigertinU. fuid .proceeding from the condenser.Around the lower portion of the container 11 and of the capillary tube portion 15 a coil 16 is arranged1 fed by a continuous electric voltage. Inside the container 11, and in its lower portion, there is a circular partition 17 with a hole 18 having a cylindrical shape, whilst in the upper part of the container there is an iron core 19 with a tip 20 in its lower part,having an adequate size for occluding the hole 18. The feeding of the coil 16 could also occur through a.c. , but in consideration of the fact that all the outer coating is a copper one, an a.c. feeding would generate induced currents which would cause losses. Furthermore the functioning would be very noisy. In rest conditions, when no current circulates inside the coil 16, the iron core 19 and its bit 20 occlude completely the hole 18 due to their weight and especially to the pressure of some atmospheres of the refrigerating fluid arriving from the condenser which press them downwards in this way the electric valve remains closed and refrigerating fluid is not flowing through. When coil 16 receives electric current, a magnetic flux is generated which in turn generates a force which attracts the iron core 19 and its bit 20 upwards,against the resistance pf the pressure of the refrigerating fluid arriving from he con censer nd tending to thrust such components downwards nowever the attraction strength in upward direction is such that it overcomes such resistance and the final effect is an upward movement of the components mentioned above, so that tey no longer obstruct the hole 18. It is to be noted that the sustentation of the core 19 by the magnetic attraction of the coil 16 is made easier through the fact that the contrivance is inserted by cutting through the capillary tube so that same produces a decrease in the pressure exerted on the core 19 by the flow of refrigerating fluid. Furthermore when core 19 is completely lifted, the entire inner part of the container 11 is essentially under the same pressure.In this way the electrovalve is open and the refrigerating fluid can flow through. en the coil 16 is de energized, bit 20 falls down but the pressure force of the fluid keeps it compressed against the hole 18 so that the electrovalve is maintained closed. With the above described contrivance appearing on figure 1, one obtains therefore a regulation called digital for the refrigerating fluid, because in consequence of control current reaching coil 16 and obviously in dependence on the pressure of the refrigerating fluid, the elec trovalve remains open or closed.A continuous regulation of the refrigerating fluid flow, according to a system called analogue , can be obtained by using the contrivance appearing on figure 3, slightly different from that of figure 1, where parts of capillary tubes 13 and 15 are exchanged in respect of ..e end connections with the container 11. art 5 through wjiich arrives the fluid proceeding from the condenser is welded to the lower aperture of the container 11, whist the part 13 through which fluid flows to the evaporator is welded to the upper aper ture of the container 11. lWloreover the coil 16 is arranged around the lower area of the container 11 and the hole 18t cut into the circular partition 17 assumes the form of a truncated cone whilst the bit 20 of t e core 19 is adequately mae of nylon. In this case, and in rest conditions, when no current passes through the coil 16, the iron core 19 and its bit 20 should close due to their weight the hole 18 , but the pressure of the refri gerating fluid counterbalances the said weight, so that they assume a position which allows the flowing through of all the refrigerating fluid,thus permitting to obtain the maximum flow designed for the capillary tube. When a determined quantity of current passes through the coil 16 an appropriate magnetic flux is generated which in turn generates a force attracting the iron core 19 and its bit 20, which occludes partially the hole 18 , thus reducing the flow of the refrigerating fluid to a certain extent. The displacement of the iron core 19 and of its bit 20, and therefore the size of the occlusion of the hole 18 are a function of the quantity of current circulating through the coil 16, so that by varying continuously such a current, one can vary with the same precision said aperture of hole 18 . In dependence on the size of the capillary tube 13 and of the capillary e 3 and on the opening of said hole 8 ne can obtain an exact regulation of khe flow of the rerr er tin fluid which never lowers to nought due to the considerable contrary force exerted by the refrigerating fluid in regard to the core 19 against which the flow is striking.It is further to be noted that the different shape of the two holes 18 is cylindrical and 18 has the form of a truncated cone has its importance, because the shape of a truncated cone although useful in the instance of the figure 3 for an analogue regulation of the flow, is no longer applicable in the case of figure 1 for a digital regulation of same, in view of the fact that the faying surface between bit 20 and hole 18 would be then so largessthat extremely strong currents should be fed to the oil 16 to obtain a disjuction between such two components.It is therefore usefull to have in this case a small faying or contact surface between such components through a cylindrical hole 18.One can also note that the part of capillary tube which is bent on the side of the container 11 allows an easy replacement of the coil 16 Figure 1 and 3 as a matter of fact should said coil 16 be damaged for a whatsoever reason and be therefore replaced, it would be sufficient to extract it from its position, without disturbing in the slightest the refrigerating fluid circuit.With reference to figures 2 we can observe a compressor 1, condenser 2 connected to the outlet of compressor 1, a de hydr ting str ner for the refri r ting fluid 3 on the outlet of Sr cor. er.ser 2, a first canil7 ry tube 4F diameter 0,70 mm, length 2800 mm connected with the dehydrSt ng strainer 3, a first electrovalve with a removable coil 5F like that on fig.1 , inserted into the first capillary tube 4F which is appropriately interrupted, a first evaporator 6F connected with the capillary tube 4F, a second capillary tube 4C diameter 0,70 mm, length 3200 mm connected with the dehydrating strainer 3, a second electrovalve with removable coil 5C, just as on figure 1, inserted into the second capillary tube 4C, appropriately interrupted, a second evaporator 6C,the inlet of which is connected with the outlet of the first evaporator 6F and the second capillary tube 4C, and a return flue 7 connecting the outlet of the second evaporator 6C with the input of the compressor 1. j The functioning of the refrigerating assembly is carried out by a thermostatic circuit which does not appear on figure and is as follows when both cells require cold, the compressor 1 starts to function, the electrovalve 5F remains open , the electro valve 5C is closed . In this way the refrigerating fluid can circulate in both evaporators 6F and 6C and is cooling both cells.when only one cell that for frozen food needs cold, compressor 1 is always in operation, while the electrovalve 5F is closed and the electrovalve 6F is open. In this way no refrigerating fluid is circulating in the evaporator 6F and the fresh food cell is not cooled, while the circulation of refrigerating fluid in the evaporator 6 o ls the cell c ntaining frozen f od. It re dlately after the stopping of the compressor 1, the thermostatic circuit opens both lectrovalvns 5F and 5C and allows a quick re balancing of the pressures of refrigerating fluid, thus avoiding the degrading of the evaporators 6F and 6C. 7n a variant, said thermostatic circuit can open the first electrovalve 5F and close the second one 5C in this way the re balancing of the pressures of the refrigerating fluid is not occurring very rapidly but the whole of the outer heat is scattered on the evaporator of the cell for fresh food 6F, which is not worsening the operation because it finds itself in a phase of defrosting. In this way , as can be noted, it was possible to obtain an essentially independent functioning of the two cells used for cooling purposes and the drawbacks connected with the degracing of the evaporators were avoided. As can be noted from the description of the functioning, the electrovalve forming the subject of the present invention, may replace with the same performance an electrovalve of the known two ways type, while two of the same electrovalves connected as per figure 2 may replace a three ways electrovalve of a known type.It may even be added that this arrangement is advantageous as against the three ways electrovalve because the latter can have only two positions way A open and way B closed and way Aclosed and way B open, which can be indicated by symbols 01 and 10 The two electrovalves 5F nd 5C connected as shown flow four corbinations viz. 5F closed 5C closed, 5F closed 5 open, 5F open SC closed, SF open SC on which can be nndica ted as 00,01,10,11 and through which one can obtain a performance flexibility which is not obtainable with a three ways electrovalveIn a non a rearina variant for the refrigersting circuit of the figure 2, the capillary tube may be wanting in the relevant electrovalve 4C being the tube and 5C the electrovalve so that there remains only the capillary tube 4F, with an appropriate size and in which electrovalve 5F is inserted its type being the same of that appearing on figure 3 the regulation in this case is of the analogue kind. when both cells 6F and 6C are to be cooled, the electrovalve 5F finds itself in the maximum opening conditions and the flow of refrigerating fluid is at a maximum level with an efficiency able to cool both cells.When the fresh food cell in connection with evaporator 6C does not need any cooling, but this is the case of the frozen food cell connected with evaporator 6F one uses the electrovalve SF,in the way already described in reference to fig.3, in order to reduce the refrigerating fluid flow to a desired level, so that on the inlet of the evaporator 6Cthere remains essentially a saturated steam,practically deprived of any cooling power. In this way it is possible to cool the frozen food cell and not the fresh food one, thus obtaining an essentially indue indent functioning of the two cooling cells. in above specification shows clearly the ad ta s resented by the contrivance in respect of a refrigerating asr,e bly, al,c the same can be said of the regulation system for tax refrigeraGing fluid according to the present invention. 3uch advantages are evidenced by the fact that it is possible to use porbiclllarly cheap components for both analogue and digital regulations of the refrigerating fluid flows, that it is possible to replace the coil 16 of said contrivance without causing any damage to the circuit of the refrigerating fluid, that both cells can practically be regulated independantly for cooling purposes, that drawbacks connected with degrading of evaporators are eliminated, that the electrovalves have essentially the same performance of other known types which are more costly and finally that the functioning causes little noise. It is obvious that numerous variations are possible as far as the regulation system of the refrigera ting fluid is concerned e.g. a different way of. opening and closing the electrovalves or the shape and or the materials used for the coating or the partition or the ferromagnetic core of said electrovalves, without leaving the basic principles included in the area of the invention.
