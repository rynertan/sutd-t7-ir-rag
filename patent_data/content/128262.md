# Complex metal chalcogenides.

## Abstract
Complex metal chalcogenides which are useful for high temperature lubrication applications have the formula M Where m is a metal selected from the group consisting of Mg, V, Mn, Fe, Co, Al, Cu, Ga, In, Bi, As, Ni, Zn, Cd, Sb, Sn and Ce where M is a metal selected from the group consisting of Mo and W where A is S or Se where x ranges from 1 to 3 where p is 1 or 2 depending on the oxidation state of M where m ranges from 1 to 5 depending on the oxidation state of M and n ranges from 0 to 6.
