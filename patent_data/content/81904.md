# Variable voltage control for self excited self regulated synchronous alternator.

## Abstract
An electric generating device 1, 2 of the self excited, self regulated, brushless, synchronous type includes an alternator exciter 1 for producing an electrical output and an adjusting means 2 for adjusting the output voltage of the alternator exciter substantially independently of the winding arrangement thereof to control the no load or light load voltage of the electrical output 6 . A deactivating device 16 deactivates the adjusting control when maximum field current is demanded by a load.
