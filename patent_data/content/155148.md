# Size adjustable construction elements.

## Abstract
A size adjustable construction element uses channel spacers 30 to maintain spaced parallel relationship and positive physical contact between adjacent panel members 19, 21 . The construction element may be in the form of a multilayered mirror insulation that has an adjustement section 20 to permit use of a standard size component to fit non standard dimensions and that includes channel spacers 30 that effectively reduce convection between adjacent layers or sheets 16 , provide positive structural support, provide a bearing surface for ease of adjustement and maintain the parallel space relationship between adjacent sheets 16 .
