# Device for visually indicating a pressure or temperature condition.

## Abstract
Indicating device 10 suitable for visibly indicating con ditions such as the application of force or pressure or the exposure to a critical temperature. The device 10 includes a porous pad 20 containing an indicating dyed chemical, a wick 24 maintained in spaced relation to the pad 20 and a snap action activating means. The activating means forces the wick 24 into contact with the pad 20 and dyed chem ical migration provides visible indication of the application of force or pressure. The indicating dyed chemical may be frozen and the activating means engaged. Upon reaching a critical temperature the frozen chemical melts allowing dye migration into the wick 24 and a visible indication of expo sure to the critical temperature.
