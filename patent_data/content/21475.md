Although the silicates according to the invention may in principle contain two or three elements X with or without two or three elements Y, preference is given for the above mentioned applications to silicates containing only one element X with or without one element Y. Special preference is accorded to silicates which only contain one element X and no element Y, in other words, silicates with a general formula in which b O. As regards the presence of aluminium in the silicates according to the invention, the following should further be noted. The silicon compounds which are eligible from the economic angle for the preparation of crystalline silicates on a commercial scale usually contain a small quantity of aluminium as impurity. At least part of this aluminium is usually found in the prepared silicate.This means that if it is envisaged to prepare crystalline silicates according to the invention which contain one or more elements X with or without iron and or gallium, while starting from a basic mixture into which an aluminium contaminated silicon compound is incorporated, a crystalline silicate according to the invention will as a rule be obtained which contains a small quantity of aluminium.

The letters used in Table B to describe the reflections have the following significance SP sharp SR shoulder NL normal BD broad. g represents the Bragg angle. The crystalline silicates according to the invention may be prepared starting from an aqueous mixture containing the following compounds one or more compounds of an alkali or alkaline earth metal M , one or more compounds containing an organic cation R or from which such a cation is formed during the preparation of the silicate, one or more silicon compounds, one or more compounds in which an element X occurs in the trivalent form and optionally one or more compounds in which aluminium or gallium occurs, or in which iron occurs in the trivalent form. The preparation occurs by maintaining the mixture, preferably with stirring, at elevated temperature until the silicate has been formed and by subsequently separating the silicate crystals from the mother liquor.In the aqueous mixture from which the silicates are prepared the various compounds should be present in the following ratio, expressed in moles of the oxides M2 nO R2 q 01 20, R2 qO SiO2 0.01 0.5, SiO2 X2O3 Y2O3 10, H20 SiO2 5 50, n is the valency of M and q is the valency of R. In addition to novel silicates, the present patent application also relates to a process for the preparation of the novel silicates starting from an aqueous mixture having the above mentioned composition by maintaining this mixture at elevated temperature until the silicate has been formed and by subsequently isolating the silicate from the mother liquor. The preparation of the silicates according to the invention may be carried out both at atmospheric pressure and at elevated pressure.If reaction temperatures are used which are above the boiling point of the mixture, use is preferably made of an autoelave at autogenous pressure. The silicates are preferably prepared by maintaining the mixture at a temperature between 90 and 300 C and in particular at a temperature between 125 and 175 C for at least 4 hours. After formation of the silicates the crystals are separated from the mother liquor, for example by filtration, decanting or centrifuging. The crystal mass is subsequently washed with water and finally dried at a temperature between 100 and 2000C. Examples of suitable compounds which may be used in the preparation of the silicates according to the invention are nitrates, carbonates, hydroxides and oxides of alkali and alkaline earth metals primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl amines and quaternary alkyl ammonium compounds, such as bromides and hydroxides heterocyclic amines such as pyridine and piperidine sodium silicate, silica gels, silicic acid, aqueous colloidal silica sols and amorphous solid silicas such as precipitated silica sols aluminium hydroxide, sodium aluminate and activated aluminas, such as gamma alumina gallium oxide and gallium nitrate and compounds in which iron, scandium, rhodium and chromium occur in trivalent form, such as the oxides, the hydroxides, normal salts, in particular the nitrates and complex salts.In the preparation of the silicates according to the invention it is preferred to start from a basic mixture in which M is present in an alkali metal compound and R in tetra alkyl ammonium compound and in particular from a basic mixture in which M is present in a sodium compound and R in a tetra propyl ammonium compound. Silicates prepared by heating the above mentioned aqueous mixtures contain alkali and or alkaline earth metal ions and organic cations. By using suitable exchange methods the alkali and alkaline earth metal ions can be substituted by other cations, such as hydrogen ions, ammonium ions or ions of the rare earth metals. Organic cations can very suitably be converted into hydrogen ions by calcining the silicates. If the silicates according to the invention contain alkali metal and if it is envisaged to use the silicates as catalyst or catalyst carrier, it is preferred first to reduce the alkali metal content of these silicates to less than 1 w and in particular to less than 0.05 w. The reduction of the alkali metal content of the silicates can very suitably be carried out by contacting them once or several times with an aqueous solution which contains ammonium ions. From the NH silicates obtained in this way the H silicates can be prepared by calcination. Silicates according to the invention possess catalytic activity and may therefore by used as such as catalysts.They may also be used as catalyst carriers for one or more catalytically active metal components. Very suitable catalysts for a great variety of processes are catalysts which contain one of the following metals or metal combinations supported on a silicate according to the invention as carrier nickel, copper, zinc, cadmium, platinum, palladium, nickel tungsten, cobalt molybdenum, nickel molybdenum, zinc palladium, zinc copper and zinc rhenium. Supporting the metals on the silicates may be effected in a conventional manner, for example by impregnation, percolation or ion exchange. In order to augment the activity, selectivity and or stability of the catalysts, promoters may be incorporated such as halogen, magnesium, phosphorus, arsenic and antimony. When using the silicates according to the invention for catalytic purposes these materials should as a rule be available in the form of particles having a diameter of 0.5 5 mm. In the mode of preparation as described above the silicates are obtained in the form of a fine powder. The silicates may be formed to particles having a larger dimension, for example by moulding.During moulding the silicates may be combined with a binder such as kaolin, bentonite and synthetic inorganic oxides.When the silicates according to the invention are combined with a binder any mixing ratio may in principle be used. Preference is given to binders which contain very little alkali metal, if any. For the sake of brevity catalysts which at least partly consist of a silicate according to the invention will further be designated as 1,catalysts according to the invention in this patent application.When used for hydrocarbon conversion processes catalysts according to the invention as a rule display a higher stability according as the crystallite size of the silicate present in the catalyst is smaller. Mostly, silicates according to the invention are obtained with a smaller crystallite size according as a higher concentration of organic component is used in the basic mixture from which they are prepared. Although the catalysts according to the invention display a longer life, they still have to be regenerated from time to time. This may be effected in a simple manner by burning. Catalysts according to the invention may be used inter alia for the following processes 1. The catalytic cracking of heavy hydrocarbon oils for the preparation of light hydrocarbon oi3 distillates 2. The preparation of isoparaffins by isomerization of n paraffins 3. The hydrogenative desulphurization of hydrocarbon oil distillates 4. The conversion of naphthenes into aromatics 5. The polymerization of olefins for the preparation of polyolefins 6. The hydrocracking of heavy hydrocarbon oils for the preparation of light hydrocarbon oil distillates, such as the conversion of gas oil into gasoline 7. The hydrocracking of heavy hydrocarbon oils for the preparation of lubricating oils with a high viscosity index 8. The improvement of the light and oxidation stability of lubricating oils 9.The improvement of the octane number of gasoline 10. The preparation of olefins from lower alcohols and or ethers 11. The preparation of olefinic gasoline having a low aromatics content from lower olefins or mixtures thereof with lower paraffins 12. The hydrogenative dewaxing of hydrocarbon oils such as lubricating oil and fuel for jet engines 13. The transalkylation of alkyl substituted aromatics, such as the preparation of ethyl benzene from a mix ture of benzene and diethyl benzene 14. The alkylation of aromatics, such as the preparation of ethyl benzene from benzene and ethylene. Catalysts according to the invention are highly suitable for use in the following processes 1. The catalytic dewaxing of gas oil to improve the cloud point 2. The preparation of p xylene by isomerization of other C8 aromatics 3. The preparation of ppxylene by methylation of toluene with, for example, methanol, methyl chloride or di methyl ether 11. The preparation of p xylene by disproportionation of toluene. Although catalysts according to the invention may be successfully used for each of the above mentioned processes, the great importance of these catalysts is nevertheless in another field, for it has been found that these catalysts are eminently suitable for the preparation of aromatic hydrocarbons from acyclic organic compounds. As starting material for this aromatics preparation many groups of organic compounds are eligible, such as alcohols, ethers, olefins, diolefins, paraffins, aldehydes, ketones and esters. It has been found that these catalysts not only have the property to form aromatics from organic compounds having 6 or more carbon atoms per molecule, such as hexadecene, but surprisingly are also capable of forming aromatics in a high yield from organic compounds having fewer than 6 carbon atoms per molecule, such as methanol, ethanol and propylene. Another surprising property of the catalysts according to the invention is that when they are used for the above described preparation of aromatics, they yield a product in which the aromatics essentially contain at least 6 and at most 10 carbon atoms, irrespective of whether the preparation was started from organic compounds having 6 or more carbon atoms of from organic compounds having fewer than 6 carbon atoms.The latter property of the catalysts according to the invention is considered to be very important since aromatic compounds having 6 10 carbon atoms per molecule are eminently useful as gasoline components. During the preparation of aromatics with the use of catalysts according to the invention it is possible to start from both a certain acyclic, organic compound, such as methanol or propylene and of a mixture of mainly acyclic organic compounds. The aromatization process according to the invention is very suitable for the preparation of aromatics from methanol as well as for increasing the octane number of gasolines, such as straight run gasolines and gasolines obtained during the hydro , thermal and catalytic cracking of petroleum fractions. The preparation of aromatic hydrocarbons from aliphatic and or cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons is carried out by contacting the feed under aromatization conditions with a catalyst according to the invention. Examples of suitable starting materials for the preparation of aromatics are ethylene, propylene, butene, propane, butane, pentane, hexane, methyl pentane, methyl cyclopentane, Udex raffinates, straight run gasoline fractions, pyrolysis gasoline fractions and products obtained in the Fischer Tropsch hydrocarbon synthesis. In addition to aliphatic and cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons, it is also possible to use as feed for the aromatization process according to the invention hydrocarbons which contain a hetero atom such as an oxygen, halogen, sulphur or nitrogen atom. Examples of suitable compounds of this type are methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, 2 ethyl hexanol, mixtures of oxo alcohols, mixtures of pentanols, mixtures of methanol and propylene, methyl mercaptan, dimethyl ether, tri n butyl amine, methyl formiate, acetic acid, acetone, propion aldehyde, cyclopentanone, n butyl formiate, n propyl acetate and capronic acid. The aromatization process according to the invention is particularly suitable for use with hydrocarbons and or oxygen containing hydrocarbons obtained in the conversion of synthesis gas, iOe. a gas mixture comprising carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The conversion of an H2 CO mixture into an aromatic hydrocarbon mixture with the use of a catalyst according to the invention may be carried out in one stage or in two stages. In the two stage process an H2 CO mixture is contacted in the first stage with a catalyst which contains one or more metal components with catalytic activity for the conversion of an H2 CO mixture into hydrocarbons and or oxygen containing hydrocarbons. In the second stage the resultant product is converted into an aromatic hydrocarbon mixture by contacting it under aromatization conditions with a catalyst according to the invention.In the one stage process an H2 CO mixture is contacted with a bifunctional catalyst which, in addition to a crystalline silicate according to the invention contains gne or more metal components with catalytic activity for the conversion of an H2 CO mixture into hydrocarbons and or oxygen containing hydrocarbons. The process is preferably carried out as a one stage process.If the H2XCO mixture which is used as feed in the aromatization process according to the invention has an H2 CO molar ratio of less than loO H2 CO mixtures of this type are obtained inter alia by steam gasification of coal at elevated temperatures , the aromatization process is preferably carried out as a one stage process by contacting the gas with a trifunctional catalyst which contains one or more metal components with catalytic activity for the conversion of an H2 CO mixture into hydrocarbons and or oxygen containing hydrocarbons, one or more metal components having catalytic activity for the water gas shift reaction and a crystalline silicate according to the invention.The ratio in which the three catalytic functions are present in the catalyst may vary within wide limits and is mainly determined by the activity of each of the catalytic functions. When a trifunctional catalyst is used in the aromatization process according to the invention for the conversion of an H2 CO mixture with an H2 CO molar ratio of less than 1.0, it is envisaged that the maximum quantity of the acyclic hydrocarbons and or oxygen containing hydrocarbons which have been formed under the effect of a first catalytic function is converted under the effect of a second catalytic function into an aromatic hydrocarbon mixture mainly boiling in the gasoline range, while at the same time the maximum amount of the water which is liberated in the conversion of the H2 CO mixture into hydrocarbons and or in the conversion of oxygen containing hydrocarbons into an aromatic hydrocarbon mixture reacts under the influence of a third catalytic function with the quantity of CO present in the H2 CO mixture in excess with formation of an H2 CO2 mixture. Although the trifunctional catalysts which are used in the aromatization process according to the invention are described in this patent application as catalysts which contain one or more metal components with catalytic activity for the conversion of an H2 CO mixture into hydrocarbons and or oxygen containing hydrocarbons and one or more metal components with catalytic activity for the water gas shift reaction, this in no way means that separate metal components which each individually possess one of the two functions must invariably be present in the catalysts.For it has been found that metal components and com binations of metal components having catalytic acitivity for the conversion of an H2 CO mixture into mainly oxygen containing hydrocarbons as a rule also have sufficient catalytic activity for the water gas shift reaction so that it will in that instance suffice to ineorporate one metal component or one combination of metal components into the catalysts. Examples of such metal components are metals selected from the group formed by zinc, copper and chromium When trifunctional catalysts which contain these metals are used in the aromatization process according to the invention, preference is accorded to catalysts which contain combinations of at least two of these metals, for example the combination zinc copper, zinc chromium or zinc copper chromium. Special preference is given to a trifunctional catalyst which contains the metal combination zinc chromium in addition to the crystalline silicate. Metal components and combinations of metal components with catalytic activity for the conversion of an H C0 mixture into mainly hydrocarbons possess as a rule insufficient activity, if any, for the water gas shift reaction. When such metal components are used in the catalysts, one or more separate metal components having catalytic activity for the water gas shift reaction must therefore be incorporated. The trifunctional catalysts which are used in the aromatization process according to the invention are preferably composed of two or three separate catalysts which, for the sake of simplicity, will be designated as catalysts X, Y and Zç Catalyst X is the catalyst which contains the metal components with catalytic activity for the conversion of an H2 CO mixture into hydrocarbons and or oxygen containing hydrocarbons. Catalyst Y is the crystalline silicate. Catalyst Z is the catalyst which contains the metal components with catalytic activity for the water gas shift reaction. As has been explained above, the use of a catalyst Z may in some instances be omitted. If as catalyst X a catalyst is used which is capable of converting an H2 CO mixture into mainly oxygen containing hydrocarbons, a catalyst is preferredwhich is capable of converting the H2 CO mixture into mainly methanol and or dimethyl ether. For the conversion of an H2 CO mixture into mainly methanol, catalysts containing the above mentioned metal combinations are very suitable. If desired, the said metal combinations may be supported on a carrier. By incorporating an acid function into these catalysts, for example by supporting the metal combination on an acidic carrier, it is possible for the H2 CO mixture to be converted not only into methanol but also for a considerable part into dimethyl ether. Catalysts X having activity for the conversion of an H2 CO mixture into mainly hydrocarbons are known as Fischer Tropsch catalysts. As a rule these catalysts contain one or more metals of the iron group or ruthenium, together with one or more promoters to augment the activity and or selectivity and sometimes a carrier material such as kieselguhr. If in the aromatization process according to the invention starting from an H2 CO mixture use is made of a catalyst combination in which catalyst X is a FischerTropsch catalyst, preference is given to an iron or cobalt catalyst, in particular a catalyst of this type which has been prepared by impregnation. Examples of suitableFischer Tropsch catalysts are catalysts prepared by impregnation which contain either iron, potassium and copper, or cobalt, thorium and magnesium, supported on silica as carrier.If desired, it is also possible to use in the aromatization process according to the invention starting from an H2 CO mixture catalyst combinations which contain a catalyst X capable of con verting an H2 CO mixture into a mixture containing hydrocarbons and oxygen containing hydrocarbons in comparable quantities Such a catalyst also contains as a rule sufficient catalytic activity for the water gas shift reaction so that the use of a catalyst Z in the combination can be omitted.An example of a catalyst X of this type is an iron ehromium oxide catalyst. If desired, it is also possible to use in the aromatization process according to the invention starting from an H2CO mixture catalyst combinations which contain two or more catalysts of the type X, for example in addition to a first catalyst of the type X which is capable of converting an H2 CO mixture into mainly hydrocarbons a second catalyst of the type X which is capable of copverting an H2 CO mixture into mainly oxygen containing hydrocarbons. Catalysts Z which are capable of converting anH20 CO mixture into an H2 C02 mixture are known in the literature as CO shift catalysts. A very suitable catalystZ for the present purpose is a catalyst containing zinc and copper. The conversion of an H2 CO mixture into an aromatic hydrocarbon mixture according to the invention is preferably carried out at a temperature between 200 and 500 C and in particular between 300 and 450 C, a pressure between 1 and 150 bar and in particular between 5 and 100 bar and a liquid hourly space velocity of 50 5000 and in particular 300 3000 Nl of gasil of catalyst hour. In the preparation of an aromatic hydrocarbon mixture according to the invention starting from an H2 CO mixture with an H2 CO molar ratio of less than 1.6 use is preferably made of an H2 CO mixture which has been prepared by steam gasification of coal at elevated temperature. The aromatization process according to the invention is also very suitable for the preparation of p xylene from lower hydrocarbons such as propane, propylene, butanes, butenes, n hexane, cyclopentane and methyl cyclopentane. In addition to being suitable as catalysts or catalyst carriers, the silicates according to the invention are also suitable for a variety of other applications, for example as adsorption and extraction agent, desiccant, ion exchanger and molecular sieve. An important application of this type is, for example, the separation of p xylene from mixtures of p xylene with o xylene and m xylene. A number of processes which can be carried out using a silicate according to the invention are summarized below 1.

Three catalysts 1 3 were prepared by mixing aZnO Cr203 composition with the silicates I Ill. The atomicZn percentage of the ZnO Cr203 composition, based on the sum total of Zn and Cr, was 70 . All catalyst mixtures contained 10 parts by weight of the ZnO Cr203 composition per part by volume of silicate. The catalyst mixtures 1 3 were tested for the preparation in one stage of an aromatic hydrocarbon mixture from an H2 CO mixture. The experiment was carried out in a 50 ml reactor which contained a fixed catalyst bed with a volume of 7.5 ml. An H2 CO mixture with an H2 CO molar ratio of 0.5 was passed over the catalyst for 48 hours at a temperature of 375 C, a pressure of 60 bar and a liquid hourly space velocity of 1000 N1.1 1.hour 1.
