# Fluidised bed.

## Abstract
Fluidised bed combustor comprising a housing 10 and an air diffuser bed support arrangement 13,14,15,16 dis posed in the housing 10 to support and fluidise a bed of material 11 in the housing 10 in such a manner that there is formed in the bed 11 a combustion zone 17 in which material is burned, a feed zone 19 into which material or fuel to be burned may be fed and mixed with the material of the bed 11 and an ash segregation zone 20 in which ash resulting from combustion may be at least partially sepa rated from the bed material, and in which the diffuser 13,14,15,16 is arranged to cause the bed material to circulate in operation from the combustion zone 17 through the feed zone 19 , through the ash segregation zone 20 and back into the combustion zone 17 . In a second mode a circulation takes place through the combustion zone 17 , a drive zone 18 over and onto the surface 26 of the bed 11 , partly into the feed zone 19 and partly back into the combustion zone 17 .
