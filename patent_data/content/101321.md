# Method of producing grain oriented silicon steel sheets or strips having high magnetic induction and low iron loss.

## Abstract
Grain oriented silicon steel sheets or strips having high magnetic induction and ultra low iron loss can be obtained by the intermediate annealing cycle containing a rapid heating and rapid cooling just before final cold rolling, wherein a first cold rolled sheet is rapidly heated from 500 C to 900 C at a heating rate of at least 5 C sec and the steel sheet heated in the intermediate annealing is rapidly cooled from 900 C to 500 C at a cooling rate of at least 5 C sec.
