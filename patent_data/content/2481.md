# A process for preparing acetic acid by the vapor phase oxidation of lower aliphatic hydrocarbons.

## Abstract
The present invention provides a highly efficient process for use in the high pressure catalytic vapor phase reaction for the high yield conversion of lower aliphatic hydrocarbons such as n butane to corresponding monocarboxylic acids such as acetic acid. The oxidation reaction takes place under hydrocarbon rich conditions. The increased efficiency in this process is realized by the judicious use of steam and the catalyst systems set forth in the instant invention.
