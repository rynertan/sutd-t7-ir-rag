# Surface acoustic wave device.

## Abstract
This Surface Acoustic Wave SAW filter has a tilted, interdigital transducer 14 and a normal interdigital trans ducer 16 separated from each other on a piezoelectric substrate 12 . An input signal with a large bandwidth is applied to the tilted transducer, while an output signal is obtained from the normal transducer. Guaranteed attenua tion can be greatly improved, and ripple in the pass band markedly reduced, by grounding one 30 of the electrodes 30, 32 of the tilted transducer. This electrode 30 is the one containing the longer 46 1 of the two electrode fingers 40 1, 46 1 closest to the normal transducer.
