# Radio communication device and method of controlling transmitter output power.

## Abstract
A radio communication device comprises a portable communication device and a power amplifier device adapt ed to accommodating the portable communication device thereinto for amplifying a transmitter output therefrom. The radio communication device further comprises a detector circuit for detecting that an electrical coupling between the portable communication device and the power amplifier de vice, thereby effecting a control such that the transmitter output power level is kept at a minimum input level required for the power amplifier device. Thus, this can suppress ex cessive heat generation in the communication device when the portable communication device is used by being accom modated in the power amplifier device.
