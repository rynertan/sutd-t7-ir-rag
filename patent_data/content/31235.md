# Polymer bituminous material blends, process for making articles from such blends, and articles made by the process.

## Abstract
Blends of chlorosulphonated polyethylene and defined bituminous material are modified by the addition of not more than 15 by weight, based on total weight of chlorine containing syntheticelastomer, of a thermoplastic olefin polymer having a softening point in the range 110 160 C. The incorporation of this polymer reduces shrinkage when sheets formed from the blend are exposed to heat while in use.
