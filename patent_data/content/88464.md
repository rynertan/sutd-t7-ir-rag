# Digital colour television signal processing circuit.

## Abstract
In a phase control loop 3, 15, 85, 87, 89, 90 of a digital col our television signal processing circuit an input 13 and an output 23 of a delay circuit 21 are connected to a compara tor 19 to derive a control signal from the inequality of the sig nals at said input and output.
