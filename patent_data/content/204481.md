## Description
The present invention relates to a process for producing optically active threo 3 3,4 methylenedioxy phenyl serine represented by the formula More particularly, the invention relates to a process for producing a D or L phenylserine derivative II which comprises optical resolution of a D and L isomeric mixture including racemic form of threo 3 3,4 methylenedioxy phenyl serine alkyl ester hereinafter simply referred to as a phenylserine ester derivative represented by the general formula As regards processes for producing the optically active phenylserine derivative II , a process as described in U. S. Patent No. 4,480,109 is already known. As shown by reaction formula A below, this process comprises converting a racemic phenylserine derivative II into N benzyloxycarbonyl derivative thereof of formula III by using a benzyloxycarbonylation reagent such as benzyl oxycarbonyl chloride, optical resolution separation of the diastereomer salts and decomposition of the salts by mineral acid treatment by using an optically active amine such as ephedrine, quinidine, quinine or the like, and catalytic reduction of the obtained optically active N benzyloxycarbonyl derivative in the presence of palladium on carbon or the like to yield an optically active phenylserine derivative II . The process of the present invention, as shown by reaction formula B above, is distinguished from the known process the process described in U.S. Patent No. 4,480,109 by forming the final product via a phenylserine ester derivative I . According to the present process, the phenylserine ester derivative I is obtained without using any of expensive reagents such as benzyloxycarbonyl chloride and palladium but using a cheap lower alcohol such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, or butanol and the optically active phenylserine derivative II can be obtained by optical resolution of the ester I , followed by hydro lysis of the ester portion with a cheap base such as sodium hydroxide or the like. Hence it may be said that the present process is of great industrial value. The present inventors investigated the possibility of optical resolution of the phenylserine derivative I by using various optically active acids. The result showed that with optically active tartaric acid, mandelic acid, lactic acid, glutamic acid, or aspartic acid, or the like, the formed salt is noncrystalline or even when the salt is crystalline, the difference between solubilities of these two diastereomer salts in any of various solvents is not enough large to fractionate the salts by utilizing the above difference. However, it was found that pyroglutamic acid or dibenzoyltartaric acid, used in the present inven tion, forms two diastereomer salts between which large difference exists in solubility so that the fractionation is possible by utilizing this solubility difference. Based on this finding, the present invention has been accomplished. The phenylserine derivative II , which can be produced according to the process of the present invention, is useful as an intermediate for optically active threo 3 3,4 dihydroxyphenyl serine represented by the formula In general formula I above, the lower alkyl group includes linear or branched C₁ C₄ alkyls, for example, methyl, ethyl, n propyl, isopropyl, n butyl, and t butyl. The present invention is described below in more detail. According to the invention optically active threo 3 3,4 methylenedioxyphenyl serine represented by formula II can be produced as follows A D and L isomeric mixture including racemic form of the phenylserine ester derivative represented by general formula I above is reacted with optically active pyroglutamic acid or optically active dibenzoyltartaric acid in a suitable solvent to form two diastereomer salts of the derivative. Utilizing the difference between their solubilities, the less soluble one of them is precipitated to fractionate them. Then a base is added to one of the separated diastereomer salts to split it into the salt components and obtain the desired L or D phenylserine ester derivative. Further, this derivative is hydrolyzed at the ester portion to yield the desired optically active threo 3 3,4 methylene dioxyphenyl serine. The slightly soluble diastereomer salt precipitated in the above process, for instance, when dibenzoyl L tartaric acid is reacted on the phenylserine ester deriva tive of general formula I wherein R is methyl, is the salt of L phenylserine ester derivative with dibenzoyl L tartaric acid, while the salt of D phenylserine ester derivative with dibenzoyl L tartaric acid remains in the mother liquor. In the optical resolution step of the present inventive process, the diastereomer salts can be formed and fractionated at temperatures of 0 to 80 C or by heating a solution of the salts up to around the boiling point of the solvent and the cooling to a temperature of 0 to 30 C. In view of optical resolution efficiency, preferred temperatures of the salt formation and fractionation are 20 to 40 C. The salt formation is satisfactory in several minutes though several days may be taken for it. There is no particular restriction on the salt formation period. Optically active pyroglutamic acid or optically active dibenzoyltartaric acid, an optically resolving agent, is used in an amount of 0.5 to 1 mole per mole of a D and L isomeric mixture including racemic form of the phenyl serine ester derivative. Preferably the amount is from 0.8 to 1 mole in view of optical resolution efficiency. Suitable solvents for use to form and fractionate the above salts include alcohols, e.g. methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol dioxane, acetone, water, and mixtures of these solvents. Dioxane is preferred in view of optical resolution efficiency. The obtained salt of optically active phenylserine ester derivative I with optically active pyroglutamic acid or with optically active dibenzoyltartaric acid is split by treatment with a basic aqueous solution, and the precipitated crystals are taken by filtration or by extraction with an organic solvent. Thus the optically active phenylserine ester derivative I can be obtained. Suitable bases for the above basic aqueous solu tion are, for example, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, and sodium hydro gencarbonate. The salt can be split according to the ordinary method by using the above base in an amount equivalent to the salt or more. Suitable organic solvents for the extraction include, for example, ethyl acetate chloroform, dichloro ethane, dichloromethane, and diethyl ether. It is also possible to prepare a mineral acid salt of optically active phenylserine ester derivative I by adding an aqueous mineral acid solution to the above salt to split this, and washing the resulting aqueous solution with an organic solvent, followed by concentrating the aqueous solution. For example, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, or phorphoric acid is used as the mineral acid in an amount of 1 to 2 equivalents to the salt. Suitable organic solvents for the washing are, for example, ethyl acetate, chloroform, dichloroethane, dichloromethane, and diethyl ether. Conventional conditions of hydrolyzing esters are applicable to the hydrolysis of the optically active phenylserine ester derivative I obtained by the salt splitting. However, the hydrolysis is better carried out in a solution of an alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide e.g. sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, barium hydroxide etc. in a polar solvent such as methanol, ethanol, water, or a mixture of them at room temperature or under cooling. After completing of the reaction, the objective product can be isolated and purified according to techniques used for the isolation and purification of common amino acids. Since the objective compound of the present inventive process is an amino acid, it is possible, if desired, to transform the amino group into an inorganic salt of hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, or the like or into an addition salt of an organic acid such as acetic acid, methanesulfonic acid, or the like, or transform the carboxylic group into an alkaline salt, alkaline earth salt or ammonium salt. The phenylserine ester derivative represented by general formula I , which is used as a starting material in the process of the present invention, can be prepared, as shown in reaction formula B above, by subjecting a D and L isomeric mixture including racemic form of the phenylserine derivative II see U.S. Patent No. 4,480,109 to esterification. Conventional conditions of esterifying amino acids can be applied to this esterification. For instance, the phenylserine derivative II can be esterified in an excess of the corresponding alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst.
