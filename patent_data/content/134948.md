## Description
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This application is a continuation in part of U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 509,455, filedJune 30, 1983, now abandoned. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention This invention relates to the removal of acid gases from gaseous mixtures and to compositions useful in the manufacture of aqueous alkaline absorbents. The compositions are expressly characterized by their efficiency in removing acid gases, such as H2S, from gaseous mixtures. Such gaseous mixtures include natural gases, refinery gases, Claus gases, coke oven off gases, coal gasification gases, landfill gases, any synthetic gas product and the like. The composition is particularly effective in removing acid gas from low pressure gas streams containing H2S.Description of the Prior Art Much research and effort has been expended for the purpose of improving the treatment of gas streams to remove acid components. Aqueous alkanolamine solutions have been used for over 50 years to remove acid gas components from gas streams. Hydrogen sulfide H2S is very toxic and must be removed before high pressure natural gas streams can enter a pipeline system.H2S is also removed from lower pressure refinery gas streams and from atmospheric pressure Claus tail gas treating units. Two deficiencies exist in the state of the art amine based technology for these applications. First, H2S absorption into the amine solutions becomes more difficult at lower gas pressures simply due to the lower H2S partial pressure driving force. At the high pressures of most natural gas streams, H2S generally can be easily removed down to the 4 ppm pipeline specification. This specification often cannot be met at the lower pressure of refinery gas streams.The 10 ppm H2S specification for the very low pressure Claus tail gas streams is essentially impossible to achieve by amine treating and is dealt with by costly post incineration which converts theH2S not removed by absorption to SO, which has a higher specification. Unfortunately, SO, is suspected as being responsible for forming acid rain and it is highly desirable to avoid its introduction into the atmosphere. A second disadvantage is that the primary and secondary amines conventionally used in absorbent solutions also coabsorb CO2 which is often present and may not need to be completely or even partially removed. Removing CO2 adds directly to equipment sizes and processing costs which are significant at current energy prices.Furthermore, avoiding CO2 removal is vital toClaus tail gas processing when the absorbed H2S is recycled to the Claus unit. Recycling CO2, an inert gas, significantly dilutes the H2S stream, often to the point that a conventional Claus reactor cannot function. Diisopropanolamine DIPA and pethyldiethanolamine MDEA exhibit kinetic selectivity for H2S over CO2 due to a relatively slow hydration step that CO2 must undergo to form carbonic acid before reacting with these amines. H2 S does not have to go through this step and can react directly with these amines resulting in a much faster rate of absorption. These amines exhibit kinetic selectivity and can be used in processes which have been designated to exploit the much faster absorption rate of H2S compared to CO2 to achieve selective H2S removal. Nonetheless, some CO, is still removed in such methods of use and further improvement in the kinetic selectivity properties of such solvents is desirable. U.S. Patent No. 2,718,454 describes a process for using potash and similar alkali metal salts in conjunction with amines such as monoethanolamine, diethanolamine and triethanolamine to remove acid gases from a gas mixture. The combination of alkali metal compounds in conjunction with the designated amine allegedly yields the higher capacity for acid gases than systems using the amines alone. U.S. Patent No. 3,144, 301 discloses the use of potassium carbonate in conjunction with diethanolamine and monoethanolamine to remove CO2 from gas mixtures. U.S. Patent Nos. 3,637,345, 3,763,434 and 3,848,057 disclose processes for removing acid gases by using aqueous carbonate scrubbing solutions activated by an amine. U.S. Patent No. 3,848,057 describes in addition the addition of a weakly acidic C02 hydration catalyst such as boric acid, sulfurous acid or formaldehyde but specifies amounts of such acidic materials far in excess of those amounts that are useful in achieving the advantages of the present invention. Furthermore, U. S. PatentNo. 3,848,057 is concerned with the kinetics of C02 removal using boric acid and other weak acidic C02 hydration catalysts to speed up the absorption of C02 and is not concerned with altering the vapor liquid equilibria of gases containing H2S and absorbents in contact therewith.Boric acid which is the weak acid preferred by this patent is inoperative in the present invention. The amounts of the weak acidic C02 hydration catalyst disclosed as most advantageous by U. S. Patent No.3,848,057 are not only inoperative in the present invention but are counter productive in producing an off gas that is higher in H25 content than the H25 content of an off gas where no acid is used. U.S. Patent No. 3,856,921 discloses a process for removing acid gas by use of a basic salt of an alkali or alkaline earth metal and an amine activator. British Patent No. 1,063,517 also discloses the use of potassium carbonate and potassium borate in conjunction with particular amines to avoid corrosion problems and accelerate the absorption and subsequent deabsorption of C02 and H2S. U.S. Patent Nos. 3,856,926, 3,685,960 and 3,896,212 teach the improvement of CO, absorption rates into alkali metal salt solutions by adding small amounts of water soluble, substituted amines.The improvements as claimed in these patents as well as all those mentioned hereinabove are purely kinetic and none of these patents discuss any improvements due to alterations in the equilibrium curves. It is known that C02 absorption in substantially all regenerable basic mediums is mass transfer limited. Therefore, equilibrium changes at low CO concentrations could not be perceivable 2 under dynamic conditions and certainly could not be useful. U.S. Patent Nos. 3,622,267 and 4,336,233 both discuss improved C02 absorption rates obtained by adding small amounts of certain secondary amines to solutions of tertiary amines which, when used alone, exhibit extremely slow C02 absorption rates. The improved C02 absorption rates are however kinetic and not an equilibrium phenomenon. U.S. Patent Nos. 4,112,050 and 4,112,051 disclose improvements due to alterations in equilibrium curves for C02 absorption obtained at high C02 concentration levels. Increased absorption capacity results when sterically hindered amines are added to potassium carbonate solutions.Equilibrium effects resulting in lower C02 levels in the absorber off gas are not expressly disclosed or obvious in the disclosure of these patents U.S.Patent No. 4,112,051 discusses the application of the hindered amine concept to non aqueous solutions. U.S. Patent Nos. 2,937,071, 3,037,844, 3,086,838 and 3,395,978 each disclose the use of alkali metal arsenite compounds as additives to potassium carbonate absorbing solutions or alone in absorbing solutions to yield greater C02 absorption rates through kinetic means rather than equilibrium means. U. S. Patent No. 3,139,324 Housset discloses a process for removing C02 and H2S from gaseous mixtures using a mixture of ethanolamine and a weak acid. The only disclosed relative amounts of ethanolamine to acid are 2 1 molar. Such a process is disclosed as removing the disturbing action of C02 on the dissolution in water of sulfuretted hydrogen without hindering the dissolution of the actual carbon dioxide. U. S. Patent No. 4,080,423 Smith et al. discloses a system for improving the rate of acid gas adsorption by using an alkaline absorbent in combination with a weak acid having a pK greater than 7. U. S. Patent No. 2,722,500 Rippie et al. pertains to a process for removing H2S and C02 from liquid and gaseous petroleum products such as natural gas, by using an alkanolamine in conjunction with a dual ionizing acid. The disclosed process is directed towards removing volatile acidic substances from liquid hydrocarbons utilizing primarily triethanolamine phosphate. U. S. Patent No. 4,153,674 Verloop et al. concerns a process for recovering sulfur from sulfur compound containing gases by reducing all sulfur constituents of the gas mixture in the presence of recycled off gas followed by absorption using a liquid and regeneratable hydrogen sulfide absorbent such as alkanolamines. It is disclosed that a strong acidic compound may be added to the alkanolamine absorbent to reduce the amount of stripping steam required and to lower the amount of unabsorbed hydrogen sulfide. Preferably, enough acidic compound is added to acidify 0.1 to 15 mole of the alkanolamine. None of the above mentioned patents however disclose, teach or suggest the use of a relatively small amount of an acid having a pKa of 6 or less or acid forming material capable of forming an acid having a pK of 6 or less in aqueous medium wherein said acid or acid forming material are added to an alkaline scrubbing liquid containing a select alkaline absorbent in an amount sufficient to protonate more than 0 and up to 225 of said alkaline absorbent to provide enhanced acid gas removal. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention is based on the discovery that vapor liquid equilibria of aqueous alkaline absorbent solutions are favorably altered to yield more efficient absorption and stripping of acid gases containing H2S from gaseous mixtures containing same by the addition of very small amounts of acid or acid forming material to a specific class of absorbents. It has been found that this effect is pronounced at low acid gas concentrations in the gaseous mixture which results in even lower concentrations in the treated gaseous mixture.This can be of a particular benefit in treating Claus tail gas where H2S needs to be removed down to 10 ppm to satisfy environmental reg Jlations. Under current absorption technology heretofore available in the prior art, it has been possible to achieve H2S removal in Claus tail gas only down to 100 to 250 ppm. In order to bring the H25 content down to acceptable levels, it is current practice to incinerate the residual H2S to SO which has been accorded a higher allowable limit under current EPA regulations.Aside from the art rt such incineration is quite costly, it appears to be the consensus that the release of S02 into the atmosphere is the chief responsibility for the production of acid rain. The present invention provides a striking improvement in the efficiency of a cyclic absorptionlregeneratio process when small amounts of a relatively strong acid are added to particular aqueous alkaline absorbents. Surprisingly the relatively strong acid shifts the vapor liquid equilibrium curve at low acid gas H25 concentrations to afford a greater degree of acid gas H2S removal. The invention provides compositions for mixing with water to provide an aqueous alkaline liquid for scrubbing acid gases. The invention also provides aqueous alkaline solutions for scrubbing acid gases and it also provides procedures and methods for removing H2S as a constituent from gases by washing the gases with a select aqueous alkaline scrubbing material containing relatively small amounts of relatively strong acids and subsequently regenerating the scrubbing liquid. Tripotassium phosphate K3PO4 was promoted in the 1950 s as a selective solvent for absorbing H2S from gas streams containing H2S,CO2, and inerts. In pursuit of a goal to further improve the selective properties of an MDEA based formulation, a test program was conducted to determine if a combination of MDEA and K3P04 could provide a synergistic improvement. Initial absorber results showed no effect on CO2, but did show enhanced H2S removal. Improved selectivity was implied because fewer absorber trays would be needed for H2S removal and by using less trays C02 absorption could be reduced. However, it was found that the stronger basicity of K3P04 hindered regeneration which is essential in commercial practice.In fact, it was discovered that K3PO4 actually decreased H25 removal under cyclic use conditions. This result was unexpected and led to further investigation of the absorption regeneration nature of MDEA at low H2 S concentrations. It was theorized pursuant to this invention that perhaps a base weaker than MDEA or even an acid might produce the opposite effect when added to MDEA and thereby enhance H2S removal. Tests with K2HPO4 which has a basicity close to that of MDEA, produced results similar to that ofMDEA only. This is expected according to the theory of the present invention. Tests with small amounts of H3PO4 in MDEA have shown an increase in the total H2S removed under cyclic use conditions.The results also indicate that there is an optimumH3P04 concentration of about 1.4 in 50 50 MDEA water scrubbing solution which yields the maximum improvement. Other acids show similar results. It is theorized that the presence of a small amount of acid favorably alters the H2S MDEA vapor liquid equilibria curve and improves overallH2S removal particularly at low H2S concentrations found at the lean top end of the absorber and at the lean bottom end of the stripper. By studying the absorption of H2S and C02 in a laboratory absorber and focussing on the performance at the top of the absorber where H2 S concentrations are low, it was discovered that the addition of small amounts of soluble compounds with a pH different from 50 aqueous MDEA changed the degree of H2S removal or the concentrations ofH2S in the absorber off gas. To similate a cyclic process, MDEA solutions were prepared containing amounts of H25 and C02 representative of the rich solution following an absorption. These solutions were stripped under constant and identical conditions to produce a lean solution for the absorption experiments. It was recognized that additives that affect absorption are also likely to affect desorption which necessitates that the entire cyclic process be simulated.By this method, it has been found that compounds having a higher pH than that of MDEA hinder H2S removal and yield higher H25 levels in the absorber off gas. Compounds of lower pH enhance H2S removal. An explanation is offered that the compounds alter the shape of theMDEA H2S vapor liquid equilibrium curve which in turn affects the efficiency and degree of H2S removal in a cyclic system employing an absorber and a stripper, each having a finite number of trays.Adding a small amount of an acidic compound pursuant to this invention produces the favorable effect of enhanced H2 S removal. Acids, such as phosphoric acid, whose anions exhibit low corrosivity in basic medium are preferred. It was also learned that maximum H2S removal occurs when the phosphoric acid concentration is in the range of 0.5 2.55 based on the total weight of a 50 50 MDEA water absorbing solution containing same. At higher concentrations the MDEA becomes significantly neutralized by the acid and begins to lose the necessary basicity to remove H2S. The improvement of the MDEA acid aqueous mixture in enhancing the removal of H25 can be exploited in three ways 1 Maintain process conditions constant and produce an absorber product gas lower in H2S content. 2 Employ less absorber trays such thatH2S removal is the same as if no acid were present. This will result in less C02 absorption, thus improving the selectivity. A further benefit will be a reduced reboiler energy demand because of the reduced C02 load. 3 If employing less absorber trays is not possible because multiple lean solution feed points are not available, energy savings can be realized by reducing the reboiler rate until theH2S level in the absorber off gas increases to the level without the acid present. The effective concentration range is 0 4.5 H3PO4 and the optimum is .5 2.5 based on the total weight of a 50 50 MDEA water absorbing solution containing same. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In accordance with this invention, the novel compositions for mixing with water to provide aqueous, alkaline liquids for scrubbing acid gases containing H2S are prepared by simply mixing an acid having a pKa of 6 or less or an acid forming material capable of forming in an aqueous medium an acid having a PKa of 6 or less with a select alkaline material in an amount sufficient to protonate more than 0 but not more than 22 of said alkaline material. Preferably an acid having a of of5 or less and most preferably 4 or less are used and amounts sufficient to provide 0.1 to 22 and most preferably 2 to 135 protonation of the alkaline material are employed. The novel aqueous alkaline scrubbing solutions are prepared by simply mixing the above mentioned composition with water in an amount adequate to provide 5 to about 70 wt. X, preferably 20 to 60 wt. , of the alkaline material based on the total weight of the scrubbing liquid or solution. Alternatively, the novel scrubbing solution can be prepared by dissolving in water a sufficient amount of the alkaline material to provide a 5 to 70 wt. , preferably 20 to 60 wt. , aqueous solution of said alkaline material in said solution and mixing a sufficient amount of an acid having a pK of 6 or less, preferably 5 or less, most preferably 4 or less, or an acid forming material capable of forming an acid having PKa characteristics as defined above.The amount of acid or acid forming material being added is sufficient to protonate more than 0 and up to 22 , preferably 2 to 13 , of the alkaline material. The order of addition is not critical. For example, the alkaline material can be added to the water before, after or simultaneously with the acid or acid forming material. This invention applies to a select class of alkaline materials suitable for forming an aqueous absorbent, which do not evolve an acidic gas, e.g., CO, or S02, upon acidification, and which provide enhanced acid gas removal when combined with the appropriate amount of acid or acid forming material. For example, the invention is advantageously used in conjunction with alkaline solutions suitable for absorbing H2S gas and made from alkaline materials such as secondary or tertiary diethanolamines including methyldiethanolamine, diethanolamine, or mixtures thereof. Alkali metal carbonates are not suitable for forming an aqueous absorbent because the carbonates are converted to CO2 which leaves the system in the off gas and forms the alkali metal salt of the acid added pursuant to this invention.Thus, the acid content of the absorbent solution is not effectively increased. For example, when phosphoric acid is used pursuant to this invention the alkali metal carbonate is converted alkali metal phosphate, e.g., K3PO4, and Cm, gas which leaves the system. Thus, the addition of more and more phosphoric acid fails to effectively increase the acid content until all of the carbonate has been converted to the phosphate and CO2. Only alkaline materials providing enhanced acid gas removal, when combined with an appropriate amount and type of acid or acid forming material, are suitable in the present invention. The select class of alkaline materials providing such enhanced acid gas removal are readily determinable using well established procedures in the art by comparing the acid gas removal performance of two aqueous alkaline absorbent solutions, with and without the requisite protonation of the alkaline material. The alkaline absorbent solution which provides significant, i.e. measurable beyond experimental error, increases in acid gas removal when appropriately protonated, contains the select alkaline absorbent. The enhanced level of acid gas removal provides treated gaseous mixtures containing very low amounts of acid gas, typically 10 ppm or less, and preferably 1 ppm or less. Suitable alkaline absorbing solutions are selected from water soluble alkaline amines such as an alkanol amine, e.g. monoethanolamine and diethanolamine alkylalkanolamines such as methyldiethanolamine, ethylamino ethanol, cyclohexylaminoethanol, 2 amino 2 methyl l propanol and the like. Particularly preferred alkaline materials which have been found to provide enhanced acid gas recovery are secondary or tertiary diethanolamines, such as diethanolamine DEA , methyldiethanolamine MDEA , and mixtures thereof.The tertiary amines are preferred inasmuch as scrubbing solutions containing tertiary amines selectively absorb hydrogen sulfide over carbon dioxide. The primary and secondary amines provide little, if any, selectivity in absorbing the H2S over CO2. Mixtures of alkaline materials can also be used. In those instances where the selective absorption phenomena is not important, any aqueous alkaline solution providing enhanced acid gas removal, preferably an aqueous alkaline amine solution, is useful as a scrubbing solution. The concentration of alkaline material in the scrubbing solution can be varied over a wide range from about 5 to about 70 wt. of the alkaline material based on the weight of the scrubbing solution.Preferably, the scrubbing solution contains 20 to 60 wt. of the alkaline materials. Suitable acids that can be used in the present invention can be characterized as strong acids which include any organic or inorganic acid having a pKa of 6 or less, preferably 5 or less and most preferably 4 or less. Acids that can be used include phosphoric acid which is preferred because of its low corrosive effects, phosphorous acid, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, sulfurous acid, nitrous acid, pyrophosphoric acid, telurous acid and the like, Also, included as suitable acids are organic acids such as acetic acid, formic acid, adipic acid, benzoic acid, n butyric acid, chloroacetic acid, citric acid, glutaric acid, lactic acid, malonic acid, oxalic acid, o phthalic acid, succinic acid, o toluic acid and the like. InAddition, acid forming materials that are capable of forming acids upon contact with water can be used.The acids formed from such acid forming materials useful in this invention have a PKa of 6 or less, preferably 5 or less and most preferably 4 or less.A suitable acid forming material is sulfur dioxide. The absolute amount of acid or acid forming material can also vary over a wide range which is best expressed in terms of the weight percent of protonation of the alkaline absorbent. The amount of acid used in the invention relative to the amount of alkaline absorbent is narrowly critical and will vary depending upon the type of alkaline absorbent.For MDEA it has been found that protonation of more than 0 of the alkaline absorbent up to as much as 22 protonation of the alkaline absorbent, preferably not more than 20 protonation, is sufficient. Preferably the range extends from amounts sufficient to protonate 0.1 to 22 of the alkaline absorbent, preferably to protonate not more than 20 of the alkaline absorbent. More preferably the range encompasses those amounts sufficient to protonate 2 to 13 of the alkaline absorbent. In the case of the most preferable acid, namely, phosphoric acid, the preferred amount in a 50 50MDEA water solution is from more than 0 wt. up to about 4.5 wt. , preferably 0.5 to about 2.5 wt. based on the total weight of the aqueous alkaline absorbent solution containing the phosphoric acid. The alkaline absorbing solutions may contain optional adjuvants well known to those skilled in the art, such as corrosion inhibitors and physical solvents, in addition to water, the alkaline absorbent, and acid or acid forming material. If foaming becomes a problem, an anti foaming agent can be added to the absorbent solution at any stage of the process as is well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. The contacting of the novel aqueous alkaline scrubbing liquid and the acid gas may take place in any suitable contacting tower. The acid gas to be contacted and removed is hydrogen sulfide which may be present in trace amounts in the gaseous mixture. The contacting between the acid gas and the aqueous alkaline absorbent scrubbing liquid can be concurrent or countercurrent counter current being preferred. The contacting takes place in a single phase without regions of phase immiscibility. Temperatures during the contacting may vary between 400F. and 2500F., preferably 500F.to 2000F. Pressures may vary widely. Acceptable pressures are in the range from 0 to 2000 psia, preferably 10 to 1500 psia. As an illustration, the countercurrent contacting to remove the acid gas can take place over a period of 0.01 second or higher, e.g. up to 10 minutes or more. Contacting may take place when the acid gas containing gas is either in the liquid or gaseous state, although the gaseous state is much preferred. The contacting zone can be a packed tower, plate tower or any known gas scrubber. A stainless steel contacting tower is particularly effective.The tower can be equipped with bubble trays, preforated trays, Raschig rings or any other known packing material which facilitates contacting between the gas and liquid. After a period of time the absorbent liquid becomes substantially saturated with the acid gas H2S. The aqueous alkaline absorbing solution which is substantially saturated with acid gases such as H2S must then be regenerated to place it into condition for reuse.Illustratively, the aqueous alkaline absorbent liquid can be about 5 to 95 saturated, preferably about 10 to 90 saturated, when it is regenerated. The regeneration which can take place in a single liquid phase, is usually accompanied by flashing and passing steam through the liquid until the acid gases are stripped out. Upon entering the regeneration unit the absorbent liquid is substantially saturated as indicated above and in one phase. Stripping of the acid gas may be accompanied using known means by blowing with steam or inert gas according to known techniques. The absorbent liquid is tripped down to a very small amount, illustratively, 0.00004 to 0.02, preferably 0.0003 to 0.01, mol of H2S per mol of alkaline material, e.g. MDEA in the absorbent liquid. The absorbing liquid after being regenerated can be recycled back to the contacting tower. Makeup absorbent liquid may be added as needed. Alternatively the saturated absorbent liquid can be regenerated by inert gas, e.g. nitrogen stripping.Air is an example of an inert gas when the alkaline material in the absorbent liquid is inorganic. As an illustration, in desorption, i.e.regeneration of the absorbent liquid, the acid gas H2S rich solution from the absorber in which the acid gas containing mixture is contacted with the aqueous alkaline absorbent liquid, can be sent, in the case of high pressure absorption, first to a flash chamber wherein steam, and H2S, CO2, physically dissolved gases and entrained gases, are flased from the solution at lower pressure. The solution from the flash drum, or from the absorber, in the case of low pressure absorption, can then be steamed stripped in a packed or plate tower.Stripping steam can be generated in or at the base of the stripper. Illustratively, pressure in the flash drum and stripper can be from 1 to 100 psig for the stripper. Illustratively, the temperature of the flash drum can vary from 400F. to 25O0F., preferably 600F. to 200OF., and in the steam stripper can range between 1800F. to 3500F., preferably 1900F. to 2600F. depending, of course, on stripper pressure. Normally, the gas withdrawn from the top of the stripper contains a high percentage of H2S, e.g., 25 or more, and in such cases the gas withdrawn from the top of the stripper can be used in sulfur recovery units, e.g., Claus units, where the H2S content is converted into elemental sulfur by known techniques or it can be used as a source of sulfur dioxide in the production of sulfuric acid also according to well known procedures.In those cases where the H2S content in the stripper off gas is lower, e.g., 25 or less, the stripper off gas can be sent to modified Claus units which are equipped to convert relatively low concentrations of H2S into elemental sulfur. Alternatively, the stripper off gases of relatively low H2S concentrations can be incinerated, whereby the volume of gas subjected to incineration is much lower than the volume of the original gas before treatment according to this invention. By means of the present invention hydrogen sulfide can now be removed, under normal temperature conditions, from high pressure, e.g., more than 100 psia, gaseous mixtures containing same to very low values such as 1 ppm or less thereby eliminating a very serious safety hazard in the case of natural gas intended for residential use. By means of the present invention, H25 can now be removed, under normal temperature conditions, from low pressure, e.g., from 10 up to 30 psia, gaseous mixtures containing same to very low values each 10 ppm or less to comply with Federal EPA regulations.

Then the feed gas was passed to a knockout flash to remove any entrained water and thereafter was introduced at the rate of one liter min. to the bottom of the above described, trayed column which is maintained at a temperature of 1100F. In the column the feed gas was counter currently contacted with the MDEA solution.The off gas leaving the top of the absorber was measured in each Example for H25 content and the results are given in Table I below TABLE I Mols H3PO4 Proton PPM H2S Ex. , HzPO4 Per Mol MDEA ation In Off Gas A 0 0 0 52 1 0.1 0.0024 0.49 12.5 2 1 0.0245 4.9 1 3 2 0.04956 9.9 2B S 0.1278 25.6 100 Based on the weight of the solution These results suggest that there is a minimum amount of acid to be added in order to enhance the absorption of the H25 gas. These results also show that there is a maximum amount above which H25 removal is not enhanced. A comparison of Examples A and B clearly illustrates that at the rate of 0.1278 mols of phosphoric acid per mol of MDEA the H2S content in the off gas is actually increased over and above the amount removed when no acid at all is used. EXAMPLES 4 7 and C In each of these Examples an MDEA solution identical to that described in Example A above, that is, with no phosphoric acid addition, was prepared and fed to the top of the absorber at the rate of 7.15 cc min. The feed gas rate in each case was 0.5 liter min. Also, the absorber contained only ten sieve trays rather than 30. In Example C no acid was added to the MDEA solution whereas in Examples 4 7 there was respectively added 0.0321 H3PO4, 0.15 SO2, 0.14 formic acid and 0.1125 HC1 based on the weight of the MDEA solution. Thereafter, these Examples were carried out in the same manner as described for Examples 1 3, B and C. The amounts of H2S in the absorber off gas is presented inTable II below.

TheseExamples also illustrate the effectiveness of a wide range of acidic materials including an organic acid, another inorganic acid and an acid forming material. EXAMPLES 8 AND D The effect of adding phosphoric acid to aqueous MDEA on H2 S absorption was demonstrated in a commercial plant as described below. A 13 tray absorber was operated at 112OF. and 2.3 psig. The feed gas contained approximately 1 H2S, 20 CO2, 65 H2O and 72 nitrogen and was introduced at the bottom of the absorber at a rate of 1.5 mmscf d. The lean absorbing solution introduced at the top of the absorber contained 43 MDEA and 57 water. In Example D no acid was added to the absorbing solution. In Example 8, 1.61 wt. H3PO4 was added to the absorbing solution thus forming a solution containing 1.61 H3PO4, 42.31 MDEA and 56.08 water.The degree of protonation, the lean solution circulation and the ppm H2S in the absorber off gas are given in Table III for Example D and 8.

EXAMPLES 9 and E In each of these Examples an MDEA solution identical to that described in Example A above, that is, with no phosphoric acid addition, was prepared and fed to an absorber at the rate of 13 cc min.The feed gas rate in each case was 0.5 liter min.Also, the absorber contained 20 sieve trays. InExample E no acid was added to the MDEA absorbing solution whereas in Example 9 0.0321 H3PO4 was added before refluxing. Thereafter these Examples were carried out in the same manner as described forExamples 1 3, B and C. The amounts of H2S in the absorber off gas in each case is presented in TableIV below. These Examples show the improvements in using H3PO4 in very small amounts in the absorbing solution. The results of these twoExamples do not appear to be directly comparable with the results of other Examples because of differences in processing and analytical techniques. However, a noticeable reduction in ppm of H2S is demonstrated upon the addition of very small amounts of H3PO4 to the absorbing solution. TABLE IV Mols H3PO4 Proton PPM H2S InEx.

The phosphoric acid was added in each case prior to the refluxing step. Thereafter, theseExamples were carried out in the same manner as described for Examples 1 3, B and C.

The results of these Examples are not directly comparable with the results of other Examples described herein because of certain differences in processing and analytical techniques. EXAMPLES 14 18 and G Q These Examples demonstrate various alkaline materials which have been found useful in the present invention, as compared to alkaline materials which do not fall within the select class of materials which provide for increases in acid gas scrubbing, i.e., removal, when compared to the corresponding absorbent solution free of acid or a cid forming materials.

The results of these Examples demonstrate that only a select class of alkaline materials are useable in aqueous alkaline solutions providing increased acid gas removal. These Examples also demonstrate that the critical amount of S protonation will vary between different alkaline absorbents, with effective DEA 5 protonation narrower and effective DEA MDEA protonation broader relative to the range for MDEA.
