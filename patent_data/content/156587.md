## Description
TITLE IMPROVED PRESSBOARD AND PROCESS FOR ITS PREPARATION DESCRIPTION TECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to an improved aromatic polyamide pressboard having increased resistance to compression combined with relatively high oil absorption characteristics. The invention also relates to a process for preparing the improved pressboard. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Pressboard prepared from cellulosic materials has been known and commercially used for many years.While the cellulosic pressboard is extremely useful.its use at high temperature is limited by the low thermal stability of cellulosic materials. More recently. aromatic polyamide fibers U.S. patents 3.063.966 and 3.133,138 . fibrids U.S.patent 2.999.788 and paper U.S. patent 3.756.908 having excellent properties at high temperatures have become known. Pressboard comprised of aromatic polyamide fibers and fibrids is also known and can readily be prepared using the same procedures used in the preparation of cellulosic pressboard. Aromatic polyamide pressboard has been found to be useful in many applications. For example. in oil filled transformers it has been found to have a suitably high oil absorption which contributes to good electrical insulating properties. However, for some uses, it is necessary that the pressboard not only have a suitably high oil absorption but also provide resistance to compression so that the pressboard can provide suitable separation of electrically conducting components. It has been found that compaction processes as taught by the prior art either do not provide pressboard products having adequate resistance to compression, or that they do so only by providing a pressboard product which does not have adequate oil absorption. This invention provides an improved aromatic polyamide pressboard having a combination of good resistance to compression and adequate oil absorption. This invention also provides a process for the preparation of the improved pressboard.

The improved pressboard is prepared by a process whereby an aqueous slurry having 0.1 to 2 by weight total solids comprised of 20 95 by weight aromatic polyamide fibrids and 80 5 by weight high temperature resistant floc having a length of 2 to 12 mm.. said aromatic polyamide fibrids and high temperature resistant floc having a melting point higher than 320 C, is prepared the slurry is formed into a water leaf having a water content of 50 95 by weight the water leaf is combined into multiple layers to form a wet lap the wet lap is pressed at 100 to 2000C 2 under a pressure of 10 to 60 kg cm to form a low density pressboard having a calculated void volume of 30 to 60 by volume of the pressboard and the low density pressboard is dried. ultimately at 270 3200C. until substantially no further moisture is evolved and finally pressed at 8 to 350 kg cm2 at 270 3200C.Preferably the temperature is 275 300 C. Most preferably. the final pressing is at 275 2850C and the 2 pressure is 15 to 70 kg cm . Preferably the pressboard is cooled under restraint. Preferably the high temperature resistant floc consists of an aromatic polyamide. Preferably the aromatic polyamide fibrids and the high temperature resistant floc consist of poly m phenylene isophthalamide . DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONDefinitions By 1aromatic polyamidez is meant nonfusible polyamides wherein the amide group. i.e.. theEMI4.1 radical where R is hydrogen or a 1 6 carbon alkyl group. of each repeating unit is linked through the nitrogen atom and the carbon atom to a carbon atom in the ring of separate aromatic ring radicals. The term aromatic ring is defined herein as a carbocyclic ring possessing resonance. By aromatic polyamide fibrids is meant small. nongranular. nonrigid fibrous or film like particles of an aromatic polyamide having a melting point higher than 320eC. Two of their three dimensions are of the order of microns. Their smallness and suppleness allows them to be deposited in physically entwined configurations such as are commonly found in papers made from wood pulps.Fibrids can be prepared by precipitating a solution of the aromatic polyamide into a coagulant such as in apparatus of the type disclosed in U.S. patent 310181091. By whigh temperature resistant floc is meant short fibers, typically having a length of 2 to 12 mm and a linear density of 1 10 decitex. made of a material having a melting point higher than 3200 C. such as aromatic polyamides. aromatic polyamide imides. aromatic polyimides. polybenzimidazoles. etc.. or inorganic materials such as glass. ceramic materials. alumina, etc. Other high temperature resistant materials such as mica may also be present in relatively finely subdivided form. By aromatic polyamide floc is meant short fibers cut from fibers prepared by the processes described in U.S. patents 3.063.966. 3.133.138. 3.767.756. and 3.869.430. Conventional aromatic polyamide pressboard may be prepared by feeding an aqueous slurry of MPD I fibrids and MPD I floc to a cylinder paper forming machine whereby water is removed and multiple layers of fibrous material having a water content of 50 9SS by weight of the wet sheet is built up to a wet lap of the desired thickness. The wet lap is cut from the cylinder. laid flat and pressed at 100 200 C. under a pressure of 10 60 kg cm2.The resulting conventional pressboard usually has a high oil absorption of 20 50 by weight. a density of about 0.7 to 0.9 g cm3, a calculated void volume of about 35 to 50 by volume of the pressboard. mercury intrusion 3 volume of about 0.30 to 0.50 cm3 g, both at low and high surface volume. a ratio of total available 3 absorption volume in cm g, Va to the mercury intrusion volume at low surface volume. Vml, of about 1 and a compression set of 0.75 to 2.5 mm. However. for some uses. such as spacers used in oil filled transformers, the compression set desirably should be not less than about 0.12 mm or more than about 0.5 mm while maintaining an oil absorption of at least 8 . Pressboard with compression set values of less than about 0.12 mm do not have the combination of compressibility and resilience necessary to maintain proper spacing of electrical components in. e.g.. transformers.Pressboard with compression set values greater than 0.5 mm likewise do not maintain proper spacing of components. The above desired properties are provided by the product of this invention. It has been found that when a low density pressboard having a calculated void volume of 30 to 60 prepared as described above is further dried, ultimately at a temperature of 270 320 C, until substantially no further moisture is evolved and then pressed at 270 320 C and a pressure of 6 to 350 kgfe 2. preferably followed by cooling under restraint, a pressboard having the desired properties is obtained. The drying is preferably accomplished by step wise increase in temperature.Moisture evolution is facilitated by application and release of light pressure. In general. the pressing is preferably at 275 300 C at 15 to 70 kg cm2 for at least 5 minutes but thick products may require pressing for longer times. More than one layer of low density pressboard may be combined during high temperature pressing. In this case. longer pressing times should be employed. Preferably the high temperature pressing should be above the glass transition temperature Tg of the aromatic polyamide comprising the fibrids which in the case of the preferred polym phenylene isophthalamide fibrids is about 275C. It has been found that the process described above, wherein a wet lap is formed of multiple layers of water leaves having a water content of 50 95S and the wet lap is pressed at 100 200 C under a pcessure of 10 60 kg cm2 to prepare a low density pressbord having a calculated void volume of 30 60S. and the low density pressboard is then dried and pressed again at 2 270 320 C under a pressure of 8 350 kg cm , is essential for obtaining a pressboard product exhibiting good resistance to compression as well as adequate oil absorption. If the low density pressboard has a calculated void volume of less than 30 . the oil absorption of the final pressboard product tends to be very poor. The pressboard of this invention is useful in clamping rings and in axial and radial spacers in oil filled electrical transformers. Products of this invention have a calculated void volume of 13 to 28t by volume of the pressboard mercury intrusion volumes at low surface volume. Van1, of less than 0.20 cm3 g and at high 3 surface volume. Vmh. of 0.08 to 0.28 cm3Jg. an oil absorption by volume in cm3 g. VO, of 0.08 to 0.28 and by weight of 8 24 and a total available absorption volume in cm3 g. Va, equal to the largest of the values for Vml. Vmh and O the ratio of V a to Vml being at least 1.1. Pressboard having a calculated void volume of more than 28 or a ratio of V a to Vml of 1.0 generally exhibits poor compression set. while pressboard having a calculated void volume of less than 13 or Vmh less than 0.08 cm3 g generally exhibits poor oil absorption.The products of this invention have Va values which are quite different from Vml values. the ratio of these being at least 1.1 and as high as 4. TESTS Density. Dry pressboard is cut into a rectangular sample measuring at least 10 cm x 10 cm 4 in x 4 in , preferably at least 20 cm x 20 cm 8 in x 8 in . making sure that the corners are cut square so that the upper and lower faces of the sample are of the same area and that the dimensions can be measured accurately. The length and width of the rectangular sample are measured to an accuracy of at least 0.25 cm 0.1 in .The thickness of the rectangular sample of pressboard is measured in at least ten places spaced substantially equally apart around all sides of the pressboard. away from the edges. using a micrometer caliper which contacts the sample with surfaces having a diameter of about 0.6 cm 0.25 in at a preswsure of about 0.1 kg cm2 about 1.25 psi . to an accuracy of at least 0.00025 cm 0.1 mil . averaging the ten thickness measurements. The sample of pressboard is then weighed to the nearest 0.0001 g. The volume of the sample of pressboard Vb is then calculated in 3 cin and the weight is divided by the volume to give 3 the density in g cm Calculated Void Volume. The void volume in 3 cm .Vv, of a sample of the pressboard is determined from the relationship Vb VR Vv, or Vv Vb Vim, where 3 Vb is the volume of the pressboard in cm3 as determined above. vm is the total volume in cm3 of all the materials comprising the pressboard. and vv is the remaining volume in cm . which is taken as the void volume. V is determined from the weights and densities of each of the materials of which the pressboard sample is made. calculated as follows EMI8.1 Wf is the weight in g of the aromatic polyamide fibrids in the pressboard sample.Wi is the weight in g of the floc including any other non fibrid high temperature resistant material in the pressboard sample. and Pi is the density of the material of which the floc is made 1.38 g cm3 for MPD I and 1.44 g cm3 for poly p phenylene terephthalamide .When there is more than one kind of floc or other high temperature resistant material such as mica . W p is calculated as follows EMI9.1 where i . 1, .... nThe calculated void volume as a percentage volume. vv is then calculated as follows EMI9.2 In the case of a 100 MPD I pressboard sample having a weight in g of Wb and a volume in cm3 of Vb. and since for this caseEMI9.3 the equation reduces to EMI9.4 The calculated void volume is a measure of all of the voids. both isolated voids and interconnected voids. in a sample of pressboard. Oil Absorption. This test is carried out in accordance with the method described by theInternational Electrotechnical Commission. IECStandard. Publication 641 2. First edition 1979 . Specification for pressboard and presspaper for electrical purposes. Part 2 Methods of test, n pages 29 and 31 section 17 . published by Bureau Central de la Commission Electrotechnique Internationale Geneva.Switzerland. The result is expressed to the nearest 0.1 as a percentage by weight oil absorption on the original mass of the pressboard sample tested. The oil absorption by volume in cm3 g. VO, is then calculated by dividing the percentage by weight oil absorption by the density of the sample of pressboard. VO values are initially reported to the same number of significant figures as the percentage by weight oil absorption. then rounded to two decimal places. Compression Set. The pressboard to be tested is cut into rectangular strips 3.8 cm 1.5 in wide X 5.1 cm 2.0 in long and a sufficient number of the strips are stacked to make a stack approximately 5.1 cm 2.0 in high. The stack of samples is placed in an oven for 48 hrs. at 110 C. then taken from the oven and placed in a conventional machine for testing compressive properties. equipped for constant rate of crosshead movement and having a capacity of at least 10.000 kg 22.000 lb. e.g.. the Tinius OlsenUniversal Testing Machine. Model 60 SDT. Servo controlled. 60.000 lb. capacity. Super L UTAH. made by the Tinius Olsen Universal Testing MachineCo.. Inc.. Easton Rd.. Willow Grove, PA 19090 equipped with a Model He Flat Bed X Y Recorder manufactured byHouston Instruments. Inc. and Tinius Olsen Model D 2 and D 4 Deflectomers for accurately measuring the deflection of compressed samples at two different chart magnifications . In carrying out the test. the load is applied at the constant rate of 0.5 cm per min. 0.2 in. per min. and released. A load of 680 kg 1.500 Ib. . equivalent to 35 kg cm2 3.448 kPa 500 psi , is applied to the stack of samples. and the load is then immediately released to a load of 136 kg 300 lbs. . Tis load. equivalent to 7 kg cm2 690 kPa 100 psi . is designated as the bedding pressure.and the load is released to this bedding pressure between each cycle. The stack of samples is next cycled to 1361 kg 3.000 libs. , equivalent to 70 kg cm2 6.895 kPa 1.000 psi , returning to the bedding pressure. It is then cycled to 2.722 kg 6.000 lbs. . equivalent to 141 kg cm2 13.790 kPa 2.000 psi . returning to the bedding pressure.Figally it is cycled to 4.082 kg 9.000 lbs. equivalent to zll kg cm2 20, 685 KPa 3.000 psi .and back once more to the bedding pressure. The compression set is taken as the loss in height in mm alternatively in mils of the stack of samples. as measured by the deflectometer, upon the return to the bedding pressure after the final cycle. It is preferred to have the deflectomer readings continuously plotted on a chart so that the entire sequence of cycles is displayed on a graph for each sample tested. If the amount of sample material is limited.the 3.8 cm X 5.1 cm rectangular strips are stacked to a lesser height. preferably at least 2.55 cm 1.0 in. high. and the deflection after the final cycle is multiplied by the appropriate factor to scale the result to correspond to the result which would be obtained from a stack 5.1 cm 2.0 in. high. Mercury Intrusion Volume. In this determination a conventional mercury porosimeter Aminco Mercury 60,000 psig max. Newport Scientific Cho., Inc.. Silver Spring, MD 20910 is employed to determine the volume of mercury which can be forced into the pores, or interconnected voids, of a porous sample. To determine whether the surface area of a given weight of the pressboard has an effect on the volume of mercury which can be forced into its pores.determinations are made both on low surfacelvalume samples and high surface volume subdivided samples of the pressboard. The nominal weight of each sample tested is 0.3 g. To prepare the low surface volume and high surface volume samples. an initial sample slightly heavier than 0.6 g and preferably rectangular in shape is cut from the pressboard to be tested. The initial sample is then cut down in size e.g. with a pair of side cutters in a series of approximately 25 to 35 clean cuts straight through the pressboard near its edges to produce a corresponding number of fragments.leaving a preferably quadrilateral sample weighing about 0.3 g which is taken as the sample for the low surface volume measurement. This low surface volume sample should be of such shape that it will fit intact in the penetrometer bulb sample chamber of the porosimeter, if at all possible. If the sample is very thin and a single piece weighing 0.3 g which will fit in the penetrometer bulb cannot be prepared. the low surface volume sample is prepared in the form of two or even three pieces which will fit in the bulb.The low surface volume sample is weighed to the nearest 0.0001 g on glassine paper. A sufficient number of the pressboard fragments, preferably about 25 to 30, to weigh about 0.3 g are placed on glassine paper preferably they are collected on the glassine paper as they are cut as the high surface volume subdivided sample. The subdivided sample is weighed to the nearest 0.0001 g. To conduct the determination, a weighed sample is placed in the open penetrometer bulb, after which the bulb is capped and evacuated until the vacuum gauge displays a pressure of 50 microns of mercury or less. The filling device is then tilted backward until its stop is reached, so that the tip of the penetrometer is immersed in mercury. The stopcock on the filling device is gradually opened to admit air to the system slowly. causing mercury to enter the penetrometer bulb. tapping the tubes to aid in wetting the sample with mercury. After total wetting has been achieved. the filling device is returned to vertical position. The penetrometer is then moved from the vacuum chamber to the pressure chamber. The pressure is then gradually increased.recording penetrometer readings at intervals as the pressure increases. The equipment is customarily provided with more than one pressure gauge. e.g.recording maximum values of about 350 kg cm2 34MPa 5,000 psi and about 4200 kg cm2 414 MPa 60.000 psi , and if so the equipment is switched over to the high pressure gauge at the appropriate time as the pressure increases. The penetrometer reading at 4200 kg cm2 414 MPa 60.000 psi is recorded at the conclusion of the test. The mercury intrusion volume at 4200 kg cm is determined from the penetrometer reading in accordance with the instructions provided by the manufacturer of the equipment.For a particular specimen of pressboard, mercury intrusion volume values in cm3 g cm3 of mercury at 4200 kg cm2 pressure per g of pressboard are first determined to four decimal places, then rounded and finally reported to two decimal places both for the low surface volume and high surface volume subdivided samples. If desired, graphs of mercury intrusion volume values over the entire pressure range are constructed. based on the penetrometer readings taken at intervals throughout the test. The mercury intrusion volume at low surface volume is designated by the symbol. Vml, and the mercury intrusion volume at high surface volume is designated by the symbol. Vmh Total Available Absorption Volume. The total available absorption volume, Va I of a pressboard sample is taken as being equal to the largest of the values for Vim1 Vmh and V all values prior to 0 rounding for the sample. For any given sample of preswsboard. v. is a measure of the volume in cm3 a per g of the interconnected voids in the sample which are accessible to penetration by liquids. The ratio. V V1, is then calculated, using values of Va and Vml prior to rounding in making the calculation. In reporting the ratio, it is rounded to one decimal place. A value of this ratio equal to or greater than 1.1 is indicative of a structure of limited or partial accessibility of internal voids in the pressboard. a structure associated with good compression resistance of the pressboard when the calculated void volume of the pressboard is no more than 28 . EXAMPLE 1 At Preparation of standard Pressboard Filaments of poly m phenylene isophthalamide MPD I having an inherent viscosity of 1.5 were dry spun from a solution containing 19 MPD I, 70t dimethylacetatide DMAc , 9 calcium chloride. and 2S water. On leaving the drying tower the as spun filaments were given a preliminary wash with water so that they contained about 60 DMAc. 15 calcium chloride, and 100 150 water, based on the weight of dry polymer. The filaments were washed and drawn 4X at 900C in a counter current extraction draw process in which the calcium chloride determined as chloride content and DMAc content were reduced to about 0.1 and 0.5S. respectively.The filaments were crystallized immediately after drawing by passing them over hot rolls at a temperature of about 340etc. The filaments so produced had a linear density of 2.2 decitex 2.0 denier , a tenacity of about 3.7 dN tex 4.2 gfdenier . an initial modulus of 70 dN tex 79 gpd and an elongation of 34 . The filaments were cut to floc having a length of 3.4 mm 0.135 in . Fibrids of MI l having an inherent viscosity of 1.5 were prepared substantially as described byCross in U.S. Patent 3.756.908. issued September 4, 1973. column 5 lines 34 54. stopping short of the refining step. An aqueous slurry was prepared containing 1.0 wt. S fibrids and floc having a composition of 60 of the above MPD I fibrids and 40 of the above MPD I floc. The slurry was held in an agitated vessel and then pumped to a double disc refiner Beloit JonesModel 3000 20 inch Double Disc refiner. made by theJones Division of the Beloit Corporation. Dalton,Massachusetts 01226 . equipped with refining discs containing narrow bars and channels with surface dams. The plates of the refiner were positioned with a gap of 0.5 mm 20 mils between the rotor and the stator plates. The rotor plates were operated at 900 rpm. After passing through the refiner. the slurry was passed through a second refiner under the same operating conditions.After the two passes through the refiners the fibrids in the slurry were well reduced in size and well opened into fibrid films.while the floc fibers were well distributed among the fibrids. The slurry made in this way was then diluted to approximately 0.1 by weight solids and fed to a conventional cylinder wet paper making machine upon which a continuous sheet of wet paper was made and transferred to an endless felt. the moisture content being adjusted by suction and pressure to about 400 based on solids 80 by weight based on the wet sheet . The weight of the solids in the wet paper waes approximately 36 g m2. The continuous wet sheet was next delivered to a forming roll, where it was wound continuously on a cylindrical tube until it overlapped about 70 times.A longitudinal cut was then made in the layered paper and the entire thickness of wet lap wet layered paper was then removed and placed between the platens of a hot press. the platens being maintained at 140 C and having been covered with wire screen to facilitate moisture removal. The press was loaded at contact pressure. and the pressure was then raised to and maintained for one hour at 35 kg cm2 3450 kPa 500 psi while the platens of the press were maintained at l40eC. The product. herein designated as Standard Pressboard , was a low density aramid pressboard approximately 3.2 mm 126 mils thick.It was found to have a density of 0.82 pica3, a calculated void volume. Vy. of 41 by volume of the pressboard, a compression set of 2.13 mm 84 mils . and an oil absorption of 32.5 . V was 0.38 cm3 g, Val was 0.38 cm3 g rounded from 0.3791 . and Vmh was 0.42 cm3 g rounded from 0.4197 . V a for this Standard Pressboard sample was a 0.42 cm g and the ratio Va V11 was 1.1. B. PreParation of Comression Resistant Pressboard A 30.5 cm X 30.5 cm t12 in X 12 in square sheet of the Standard Pressboard prepared as in PartA above was predried at lSOeC for at least 2 hours and then placed between the platens of a flat press Machine No. 9175 M, Watson Stiliman Press Division.Farrel Company, Emhart Machinery Group. 25 Main St.. Ansonia, Connecticut 06401 . With the platens preheated to 280 C and maintained at that temperature.a pressure of 19.5 kg cm2 1910 KPa 277 psi was applied to the Standard Pressboard for a total of 20 minutes, releasing the pressure for a few seconds and then reapplying it after a total of 1. 2. 3, 6, 12.and 16 minutes to permit escape of any trapped gases.After a total of 20 minutes of hot pressing, the pressboard was taken out hot. placed in another press at room temperature. and allowed to cool under a pressure of 2.8 kg cm2 276 kPa 40 psi , just sufficient to keep the pressboard flat while cooling.The product, designated as Sample 1A , was an aramid pressboard approximately 2.45 mm 96.5 mils thick thickness range 2.35 2.53 mm . It was found to have a density of 1.11 g cm3. a S Vv of 20 . a compression set of 0. 30 mm 12 mils . and an oil absorption of 12.71 . VO was 0.15 cm3 g. Vm1 3 was 0.15 cm3 g counded from 0.1502 . and vmn was 0.17 cm3 9 497nded from 0.1700 . va for Sample 3 1A was 0.17 cm g and the ratio V a Vm1 was 1.1.
