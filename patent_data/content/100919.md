# Low temperature, high strength nickel based brazing alloys.

## Abstract
Brazing of metal parts employing a low temperature, high strength metal alloy is disclosed. The alloy has a composition consisting essentially of about 10 to 30 atom percent palladium, about 5 to 20 atom percent chromium, about 1 to 5 atom percent of at least one metal selected from the group consisting of copper and iron, about 10 to 20 atom percent boron, about 0 to 20 atom percent silicon and the balance essentially nickel and incidental impurities, the composition being such that the total of nickel, palladium, chromium, copper and iron ranges from about 80 to85 atom percent and the total of boron and silicon ranges from about 15 to 20 atom percent. Such an alloy is suitable for brazing Î³ superalloys and stainless steels at temperatures ranging from about 927 1010 C to provide strong, low cost joints.
