# THIN FILM SEMI CONDUCTOR DEVICE WITH ENHANCED OPTICAL ABSORPTION PROPERTIES, AND METHOD OF MAKING SAME

## Abstract
A thin film semi conductor device with enhanced optical absorption properties comprises a substrate 10 having a roughened or matte surface and a thin film 12 of semi conductor material deposited on the roughened or matte surface. The roughened or matte surface is obtained by the action of a jet or stream of abrasive particles on the surface which is to be roughened.
