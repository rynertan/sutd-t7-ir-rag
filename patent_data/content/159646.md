# A device for separating airborne particles in dependence on grain size.

## Abstract
A device is described for separating airborne particles into classes depending on grain size. The principle characteristic of the present invention lies in the fact that it comprises a hollow base body 2 , in which, in use, a depression is created an upper body 21 in which is formed a channel 23 to which there is conveyed, in use, the particle bearing air and which has a lower extremity 23 with a circular outline a mesh 8 positioned between the said base body 2 and the said upper body 21 and on which is positioned a filter 11 defining, with the lower face of the said upper body, a cavity 22 and a nozzle 28 housed in the said channel 23 and oper able to eject filtered air in proximity to the said lower end 23 of this latter in such a way that the particles flowing through the said lower end 23 are separated into various bands according to their aerodynamic diameter and are de posited on the said filter 11 .
