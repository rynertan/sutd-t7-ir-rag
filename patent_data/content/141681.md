# Test input multiplexing circuit.

## Abstract
A test signal, used to initialize an integrated circuit chip for testing, is multiplexed with a data input line 12 of the chip. The test signal circuitry 10 is inactivated during normal operation of the chip. The test circuitry 10 is activated only when a special input signal, which is a voltage at some midpoint between logic states, is applied to the data input 12 .
