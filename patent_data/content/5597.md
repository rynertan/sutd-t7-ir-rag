# Detonating gas generator.

## Abstract
A generator for oxyhydrogen gas comprises a plurality of flat metal electrodes 1 7 mounted parallel with ring like spacers 10 15 between each pair of adjacent electrodes and bolts 16,17 clamping the spacers and electrodes together to provide a sealed cell between each pair of electrodes and within the periphery of the respective spacer. An inlet 18 for electrolyte is connected to one outer cell and an outlet 19 for the gas is connected to the other outer cell. The electrodes 3 7 are imperforate except for apertures 20 adjacent the tops of the cells and in use a DC power source 21 is connected across outer electrodes 1,2. The generator is of simple construction and achieves good cooling, high mechanical strength against internal explosions and ensures a minimal quantity of explosive gas in the upper regions of the cells.
