## Description
This invention relates to a compound superconducting coil, and more particularly to a compound superconducting coil wherein a compound superconducting wire is held in a pipe, and a coolant such as liquid helium is forced through said pipe. A compound superconducting coil is a superconducting coil of compound superconducting material. To date, a superconducting coil constructed by winding a superconducting wire, containing a compound superconducting material such as Nb₃Sn, has been put to various applications, for example, superconducting coil for nuclear fusion, NMR coil for research, and strong magnetic field coil for determining properties of matter. The conventional compound superconducting coil has been mainly constructed by simply winding a compound superconducting wire into a coil. The superconducting coil thus formed has been put to practical use by dipping it in a coolant such as liquid helium and applying a magnetic field to the surrounding of said coil. Though possessed of an excellent superconducting property, the conventional superconducting coil is accompanied with the drawback that it has little mechanical strength and close care should be taken in working it into a coil, and cracks easily develop in such a coil during operation. In Selection of a cryostabilized Nb₃Sn conductor cooling system for the Large Coil Program, 7th Smp. on Eng. Problems of Fusion Research , J.W.H. Chi et al describes a superconducting coil constructed by holding a compound superconducting wire in a tube and forcing a coolant through the tube by means of a pump. However, this proposed coil has the drawback that when the coil is continuously subjected to great bending strains, the critical current sharply drops. When the critical current of the coil stands at less than 80 of that observed during the strain free state of the wire, the superconducting wire is damaged and fails to retrieve a superconducting property even after the current load is released. Thus, it has been impossible to manufacture a superconducting coil with a small diameter which withstands great bending strains. DE B 1 564 722 discloses a compound superconducting coil comprising a plurality of compound superconducting wires. The wires are received by a passage. It is accordingly an object of this invention to provide a compound superconducting coil, which, even when subject to great bending strains, enables a larger amount of current than 80 of the critical current observed during the strain free state of the superconducting coil to be conducted in a superconducting state, and is unlikely to crack during operation. According to this invention there is provided The compound superconducting coil according to this invention, offers the following advantages. Even if undergoing great bending strain, the coil ensures the superconductivity of a current whose magnitude is at least 80 of the critical current observed during the strain free state of the coil, and while being operated, the subject coil is unlikely to crack, thereby allowing the manufacture of a small diameter superconducting coils. This invention can be more fully understood from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which A compound superconducting It is theoretically possible to insert the above mentioned superconducting wire in the tube. To effect the uniform passage of a coolant, however, the preferred practice comprises the steps of twisting together a plurality of wires into a cable and holding said cable in the tube. A preferred cable has a structure of 3 The aforementioned wire or cable is held in a tube 20. This tube may be prepared from any of different materials such as stainless steel, tantalum and incolloy. The thickness of the tube may be selected in accordance with the application of the subject superconducting coil. The wall of the coil is prescribed to have such a thickness as imparts a sufficient mechanical strength to the coil and allows for its easy formation. When a tube is prepared from stainless steel, the wall thickness thereof may be, for example, about 1 mm. As cleary seen from Fig. 2, a void space is provided in the tube 20 between the cable 18 and the inner wall of the tube 20, between the adjacent individual wires 12, between the adjacent primary triplet strands 14, and between the adjacent secondary triplet strands 16 . A coolant of, for example, liquid helium is forced by a pump through the void spaces provided as described above. A total area of void spaces as compared with the cross sectional area of the tube interior is herein referred to as a void fraction . For example, when a superconducting cables of 3² x 6 structure consisting of 54 wires having a cross sectional area of 1 mm² is inserted into a tube whose interior cross sectional has an area of 100 mm², the void fraction is expressed as The above mentioned cable in conduit is wound to form a superconducting coil. The manner of this winding is the same as that of the conventional superconducting coils. The winding manner include the widely known solenoid winding and pancake winding. When the tube is wound into a coil, those portions of the turns of the wound tube brought into close contact with other wound portions are preliminarily insulated. This insulation can be effected by interposing a thin sheet 22 see Fig. 1 or 2 prepared from an appropriate resin such as formal resin, epoxy resin, polyimide resin or glass fiber reinforced resin between the aforesaid adjacent turns of the wound tube. The insulation sheet may be preliminarily sticked on the outer surface of the tube 20, or inserted between the adjacent turns of the tube while it is wound into a coil. The foregoing embodiment referred to the case where all the wires are superconducting wires. However, some of the superconducting wires may be ordinary conducting wires. In this case it is preferred that those non superconducting wires account for less than 10 of all wires. The replacement of some of the superconducting wires by ordinary electrically conducting wires favorably stabilizes the superconducting property of the resultant coil. When the subject superconducting coil is put into practical application, both ends of the coil are connected to a pump not shown . A proper coolant, for example, liquid helium, is forced through the aforementioned void spaces of the tube interior. The process of forcing the coolant is the same as that which has been applied in the conventional superconducting cable in conduit. The above mentioned superconducting coil of this invention is prepared by the following steps. First, wires are provided. The wires are twisted into a cable. The cable is received in a bendable tube. To put the cable into the tube, the cable is first placed on a narrow plate prepared from the tube constituting material. The plate is folded to wrap the cable. Last, the seam of the plate is welded to provide a tube containing the cable. The cross section of the tube is reduced by being passed through a die or between two adjacent rolls, to obtain the void fraction of 45 to 70 . Last, the cable held in the tube is heat treated to form a superconducting layer on the outside of the filaments contained in the wire. It is preferred that the heat treatment be continued for about 10 to 100 hours at a temperature of 650 to 750 C. This invention will be more apparent from the following example. Wires having a diameter of 0.3 mm including 500 Nb filaments embedded in a matrix of Cu Sn were provided. A plurality of said wires were twisted together into cables of the previously defined 3³ x 6 structure. The cables were each held in a stainless steel tube. The tubes had the respective cross sections reduced by means of a die to such an extent that the void fractions of the tubes accounted for 31 , 35 , 40 , 43 , 45 , 47 , 50 , 60 , 70 and 75 of the tube interior. To find out the lower limit of the void fraction of the coil, comparison was made between the magnitude of a critical current running through a compound superconducting cable held in the tube in a strain free condition and the magnitude of a critical current running through a plurality of sample compound superconducting cables held in the respective tubes which were bent to sustain a bending strain and having, respectively, void fractions of 31 , 35 , 40 , 43 , 45 , 49 and 50 . The measurement of the critical current was carried out by the conventional widely accepted process. The process comprised the following steps. An object section of the superconducting coil was soldered between electrodes. The whole mass was dipped in a bath of helium liquid. A magnetic field having a magnitude of 7 Tesla units was applied to the test piece from the outside of the electrodes. Determination was made of the relationship between the current running through the superconducting body and the resultant voltage. In this case, the magnitude of a current measured when the voltage of said superconducting body stood at 1 microvolt was defined as a critical current. The bending strain ε is defined as follows Assuming, as shown in Fig. 3, a tube having a width of 2r is bent in the circular form, the distance between the inner surface of the tube and the center of the circle being expressed by R. Then the bending strain ε is defined as To find out the upper limit of the void fraction, the relationship between the intensity of the current flowing through the coil and the generated voltage was studied in a magnetic field of 5 teslas for the superconducting coils having the void fractions of 60 , 70 and 75 . The results about the coil with void fraction of 75 is shown in Fig. 5. In Fig. 5, the abscissa indicates the intensity of the flowing current and the ordinate indicates the electric voltage generated. As to the coils having the void fraction of 60 and 70 , substantially no voltage was generated i.e., the coils did not move when a current up to 2,000 A electromagnetic force of 10.2 kg cm flowed. However, the coil having the void fraction of 75 presented a lot of voltage spikes as shown in Fig. 5. Thus, it can be seen that the upper limit of the void fraction is 70 . Note that although the electromagnetic force of 10.2 kg cm is 1 10 of the force which superconducting coils in practical operation receive, the magnitude of the movement of the coil tested is the same as the coil in practical use since the mechanical strength of the tested coil is 1 10 of the practically used coils.
