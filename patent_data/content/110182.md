# DOWN HOLE DRILLING APPARATUS

## Abstract
A down hole drilling apparatus having a drill tool as sembly with a cutting head at one end connected to an umbilical which extends to a retrieval reel on the surface. The umbilical provides electrical power, drilling fluid and means for instrumentation and control signals to be trans mitted between the drill tool assembly and a processing device on the surtace The drill tool assembly can propel itself into or out of a bore hole by the cyclical actuation of anchor and ram units or change the direction of drilling by actuation of thruster assemblies in response to control sig nals sent manually by an operator or automatically by the processing device.
