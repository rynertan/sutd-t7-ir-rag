# CAPACITOR BUILT IN INTEGRATED CIRCUIT PACKAGED UNIT AND PROCESS OF FABRICATION THEREOF

## Abstract
A capacitor built in integrated circuit packaged unit comprising an electrically conductive support member, first and second lead elements associated with the conductive support member, a stack of a plurality of layers comprising a first insulating layer of a highly dielectric material formed on the conductive support member, an electrically conduc tive layer on the first insulating layer, and a second insulat ing layer on the conductive layer, the conductive layer hav ing a portion exposed by the second insulating layer, a semiconductor integrated circuit chip having first and sec ond electrodes which are electrically isolated from each other, the second insulating layer intervening between the conductive layer and the semiconductor integrated circuit chip, a bonding wire electrically connecting the first elec trode to the first lead element, and a bonding wire electri cally connecting the second electrode to the exposed por tion of the conductive layer and to the second lead element. The dielectric material forming the first insulating layer pro vides a capacitor between the first and second electrodes on the semiconductor integrated circuit chip.
