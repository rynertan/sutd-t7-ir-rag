# Production of a mannan oligomer hydrolysate.

## Abstract
A method of hydrolyzing a coffee extraction residue material to produce a mannan oligomer solution having oligomers from DP 1 to DP 10 is disclosed. The coffee material, preferably spent grounds from a commercial percolation system, is hydrolyzed in a reactor in the presence of an acid catalyst. A tubular plug flow reactor is convenient, although any reactor providing for the relatively high temperature, short time reaction will suffice. Particular acid catalysts include sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, acetic acid and carbon dioxide gas. Depending on the specific time, temperature and catalyst concentration selected, a mannan oligomer solution having any desired distribution of oligom ers between DP 1 and DP 10 is produced.
