# Control apparatus for internal combustion engine provided with permanent magnet type starting motor.

## Abstract
Disclosed is an internal combustion engine control ap paratus in which an operation of a starting motor 2a is detected so as to drive an engine start control device 5 , the starting motor being provided with a permanent magnet as a field magnet, the control device being provide with a start ing state detector 6, 7 having a function for distinguishing a voltage associated with an induced voltage owing to inertia rotation of the starting motor from a voltage associated with application of a supply voltage so as not to detect the starting state of the engine when the starting motor is rotating by inertia.
