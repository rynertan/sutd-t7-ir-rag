## Description
NARROW CHANNEL WIDTH FET The present invention relates to a narrow channel width FET. The achievement of high packing density is an important factor for integrated semiconductor circuit IC devices such as large scale integration LSI circuit devices or very large scale integration VLSI circuit devices. For the realization of high packing density, provision of MISFET channel widths and channel lengths which are narrow and short respectively is desired. The provision of channel stopper regions also contributes to the realization of high packing density, because the use of channel stopper regions between aMISFET and other electrical elements of an IC device can permit the distances between MISFET and the other electrical elements to be reduced. However, when channel width is small, a problem has been experienced in that the provision of a channel stopper region can cause an increase in MISFET threshold voltage. Generally, a channel stopper region has a high concentration of impurities and there is a tendency for a proportion of the impurities to invade the channel region of a MISFET. When the width of the channel region is reduced to 2 microns or less, a proportion of the impurities of the channel stopper region diffuses into the whole of Fa substantial part of the channel region, which causes an increase in the impurity concentration in throughout or substantially throughout the channel region. Generally, in a MISFET, threshold voltage Vth and impurity concentration of a channel region have a relationship such that the threshold voltage Vth is proportional to the square root of the impurity concentration. Accordingly, the threshold voltage Vth is increased to a high level when channel width is small and a channel stopper region is provided.Therefore, there is a requirement for a MISFET structure such that the impurity concentration of the channel region does not increase even though a channel stopper region is provided in relation to the MISFET and channel width is narrow. Figures l a , l b , and l c are schematic cross sectional views illustrating the fabrication of a previously proposed MISFET. Generally, MISFETs are divided into two types anN channel type and a P channel type. Taking an N channel type as an example, a previously proposed MISFET can be fabricated as shown in Figures l a , l b and 1 c . The cross sections of Figures lea , l b and 1 c are taken in the channel length direction of the previously proposed MISFET. In the previously proposed MISFET of Figures lea , 1 b and let , a transistor forming area transistor area 13 is fabricated in relation to a P type silicon substrate 11. First, as shown in Figure lEa , a thin silicon dioxide SiO2 layer 12 is formed on a surface of the silicon substrate 11 and an anti oxidation layer pattern, such as a silicon nitride Si3N4 layer pattern 14, is formed on the SiO2 layer 12. The Si N layer pattern 14 has a pattern suitable for forming transistor area 13. Second, p type impurities such as boron ions B are injected with high concentration, so that a injection region 115 is formed in the silicon substrate 11 beneath the SiO2 layer 12 as shown by dots in Figure lEa . In this injection process the Si3N4 layer pattern 14 works as a mask so that there is no B injection region 115 beneath the Si N layer pattern 14. Third, selective oxidation is effected using the Si3N4 layer pattern 14 as a mask, so that a field oxide 34 layer 16 is formed at the surface of the Si substrate 11 except under the Si3N4 layer pattern 14. At the same time, a P type channel stopper region 15 is formed beneath the field oxide layer 16 by activating and re distributing the B injection region I15 as shown inFigure l b . Fourth, a gate oxide layer 17 is formed on the transistor area 13 after chemical removal of the Si3N4 layer pattern 14 and the SiO2 layer 12. A poly crystalline silicon poly Si gate electrode 18 is formed on the gate oxide layer 17 so as to be extended to a part of the field oxide layer 16. Fifth, n type impurities for example, arsenic ions As are injected into the transistor area 13 with high concentration using poly Si gate electrode 18 as a mask. Sixth, source and drain regions 19 a and 19 b are formed by activating and re distributing the As injection region when a re flow treatment of an insulating layer not shown in Figure l c existing between the layers is performed. As mentioned above, in the fabrication of the previously proposed MISFET, the B injection region 115 is formed by using the Si N layer pattern 14 as a mask and thence the channel stopper region 15 is formed by activating and re distributing the B injection region 115 when field oxide layer 16 is formed using the Si3N4 layer pattern 14 as a mask. The channel stopper region 15 is laterally extended at right angles to the plane of the drawing of Figure l c . In other words, the channel stopper region 15 spreads in a channel width direction of the MISFET. Figure 2 is a cross section along a channel width direction of the MISFET, and illustrates the resulting problem.As shown in Figure 2, channel stopper regions 15, provided on opposite sides of the channel region and having high impurity concentration, invade the channel region of the MISFET, reducing a channel region width Ach to an effective channel width Wch. The concentration of impurities in the channel region substantially increases, so that a threshold voltage Vth of the MISFET increases. The extent of the lateral diffusion at one side of the channel stopper region 15 i.e. the extent of the invasion of the channel region by lateral diffusion of channel stopper impurities is approximately equal to the depth of the channel stopper region 15. The depth of the channel stopper region 15 is usually 0.8 micron, so that the extent of the lateral diffusion is approximately 0.8 micron. Therefore, when the channel region width Ach is more than 10 microns, the extent of the lateral diffusion is relatively small compared with the effective channel width Wch, so that increase of threshold voltage Vth becomes negligible.However, when the channel region width Ach is as small as 2 microns affording increased packing density and decreased power consumption for theMISFET the effective channel width Wch becomes extremely small, for example 0.4 micron 2 microns 0.8 micron x 2 0.4 micron . This leads to difficulties in controlling the driving capability of the MISFET and designing the IC device. In extreme cases, impurities for the channel stopper region diffuse laterally throughout the whole of the channel region. Accordingly, the threshold voltage Vth of the MISFET becomes high. Thus, in the previous proposal there has been a problem in that there is a limit on the extent to which channel width Wch can be reduced, which causes problems in the design of IC devices. According to the present invention there is provided an integrated semiconductor circuit device, formed on a semiconductor substrate of one conductivity type, having a field area for electrical isolation and a transistor area surrounded by said field area, the device comprising, a metal insulator semiconductor field effect transistor, formed in said transistor area, having, a source region, formed in said substrate and having a conductivity type opposite to said one conductivity type, a drain region, formed in said substrate andhaving a conductivity type opposite to said one conductivity type, a channel region, formed in said transistor area between said source region and drain region, a gate insulating layer, formed on said channel region, a gate electrode, formed on said gate insulator layer, and a channel stopper region, formed in said field area, having said one conductivity type with a higher impurity concentration than said substrate, said channel stopper region being formed in contact with said source region and said drain region, but a part of said channel stopper region adjacent said channel region being spaced apart from said channel region. According to the present invention there is provided an integrated semiconductor circuit device, formed on a well formed on a semiconductor substrate of one conductivity type, said well having a conductivity type opposite to said one conductivity type and having a field area for electrical isolation and a transistor area surrounded by said field area, the device comprising, a metal insulator semiconductor field effect transistor formed in said transistor area, having, a source region, formed in said well and having a conductivity type opposite to the conductivity type of said well, a drain region, formed in said well and having a conductivity type opposite to the conductivity type of said well, a channel region, formed in said transistor area, between said source region and drain region, a gate insulating layer, formed on said channel region, and a gate electrode, formed on said gate insulator layer, and a channel stopper region, formed in said field area and having the same conductivity type as the conductivity type of said well with higher impurity concentration than that of said well, said channel stopper region being formed in contact with said source region and said drain region, but a part of said channel stopper region adjacent to said channel region being spaced apart from said channel region. An embodiment of the present invention can provide a MISFET which operates with a low threshold voltage even though the MISFET has a channel stopper region around it and has a narrow channel width. An embodiment of the present invention can facilitate design of an IC device which includes a plurality of MISFETs having different channel widths, by making each MISFET operate with substantially the same low threshold voltage, even though channel width may be small for some MISFETs. An embodiment of the present invention can offer an increased yield rate of a characteristic of eachMISFET in an IC device which includes a plurality ofMISFETs the characteristic being such that the MISFET has a narrow channel width and operates under a low threshold voltage even though a channel stopper region is provided around the MISFET. An embodiment of the present invention can provide an integrated semiconductor circuit device including a metal insulator semiconductor field effect transistor MISFET and a channel stopper region, in which , even when the MISFET has a channel region having narrow channel width ,the structure is such that effective extension of the channel stopper region into the channel region is avoided, for preventing the threshold voltage of the MISFET from increasing to a high level. An embodiment of the present invention can provide a structure including a channel stopper region which is provided around a MISFET, for preventing leakage current from flowing between the MISFET and other electrical elements of an IC device in which the MISFET is included, but which does not go into the channel region of theMISFET, so that the threshold voltage of the MISFET does not increase. The structure is provided by employing a mask in fabricating of the channel stopper region such that the channel stopper region does not invade the channel region even though channel width may be extremely narrow. Reference is made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings, in which FIGURES lea , l b and lXc are schematic cross sectional views illustrating fabrication of a previously proposed MISFET FIGURE 2 is a cross sectional view, taken in a channel width direction, of the previously proposedMISFET FIGURE 3 a is a schematic plan view illustrating a MISFET in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention FIGURE 3 b is a schematic sectional view, taken along the line A A in Figure 3 a t FIGURE 3 c is a schematic sectional view taken along the line B B in Figure 3 a FIGURE 4 a is a schematic plan view illustrating a CMOSFET structure according to a second embodiment of the present invention FIGURE 4 b is a schematic cross sectional view, taken along the line A A in Figure 4ta , and FIGURES 5 a , 5 b , 5 c , 5 d , 5 e and 5 f are respective schematic cross sectional views illustrating fabrication of the CMOSFET structure. In Figures 3 a , 3 b and 3Xc , relating to aMISFET in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention, similar reference signs designate similar elements or parts. In Figure 3 a , oblique line hatching indicates a channel stopper region 4, which surrounds a transistor area 2, for avoiding leakage current flowing between transistor area 2 and neighboring electric elements of anIC device not shown in Figures 3 in which the MISFET is formed. A source region 8a and a drain region 8b are provided in the transistor area 2. In Figures 3 a , 3 b and 3 c , reference sign 7 indicates a gate electrode under which there is a channel region 3 which is indicated by cross hatching. Since the channel region 3 has a narrow channel width 301, as seen in Figure 3 b , and a short channel length 302, as seen in Figure 3 c , a gate terminal part 71 appears relatively large as compared with the channel region 3. Since the channel stopper region 4 is adjacent to the transistor area 2 and since the channel region 3 has narrow channel width 301, if the MISFET were as previously proposed the threshold voltage of the MISFET would increase because the channel stopper region would effectively invade the channel region, as explained above. However, in the first embodiment, a part, which is near the channel region 3, of the channel stopper region 4 is retreated by a channel stopper retreat region 9 as shown in Figures 3 a and 3 b . Accordingly, the channel width 301 can be kept narrow as desired i.e. effective channel width 301 can be determined by a field insulating area field arSaa e5 to be called a field insulating layer or a field provided for restricting the channel region 3 without additional restriction of the channel region due to invasion by the channel stopper region . Therefore, increased MISFET threshold voltage can be avoided when the channel width 301 is extremely narrow.Thus, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention a channel stopper retreat region 9 is afforded.Formation of such a channel stopper retreat region 9 will be discussed below. In Figures 3 a to 3 c , 1 is a semiconductor substrate, 6 is a gate insulator. Figures 4 a and 4 b schematically illustrate a complementary metal oxide semiconductor FET CMOSFET structure in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention Figure 4 a is a plan view of theCMOSFET structure and Figure 4 b is a cross sectional view taken along line A A in Figure 4 a . Figure 5 a 5 f are cross sectional views schematically illustraing fabrication of the vwCMOSFET structure shown in Figures 4.In Figures 4 and 5, similar reference signs designate similar elements or parts. In Figures 4 a and 4 b , TNB is an n type wide channel width MISFET, TNC is an n type narrow channel width MISFET, TPB is a p type wide channel width MISFET, and TPC is a p type narrow channel width MISFET. Providing wide channel width and the narrow channel width MISFETs in a CMOSFET structure should be valuable because any combination of MISFETs, such as a combination of two wide channel width MISFETs, of two narrow channel width MISFETs, or of narrow and wide channel width MISFETs, can be selected in the design of the CMOSFET structure. In Figures 4 a and 4 b , p type wide channel width MISFET TPB and p type narrow channel width MISFETTPC are fabricated on an n type silicon Si substrate 21, and n type wide channel width MISFET TNB and n type narrow channel width MISFET TNC are fabricated on a p type well 22 fabricated in the Si substrate 21. The p type wide channel width MISFET TPB has a transistor area consisting of a drain region 29D1, a source region 29S1, and a channel region ch3 having a wide channel width. A poly Si gate electrode 27c has a contact window 31 formed in insulator 30 and under the gate electrode 27c the wide width channel region chg is located, between the regions 29D1 and 2951r below the gate electrode 27c with an intervening gate insulating SIO, layer 26. The transistor area is formed by a fieldSiO2 layer 23 under which an n type channel stopper region 24 is formed. The n type channel stopper region 24, in the vicinity of the channel region ch3, extends into the channel region, so that the effective width of the channel region ch3 is reduced, as indicated by cross hatching in Figures 4 a and 4 b .However, the extent to which the channel region is invaded by the n type channel stopper region 24 is small each end of the length being invaded to the extent of approximately 0.8 micron as mentioned before. Compared with a nominal or design channel width which is generally more than 10 microns, the resultant reduction of the effective channel width of the MISFET TPB is negligible. The p type narrow channel width MISFET TPC has a transistor area consisting of a drain region 29D2, a source region 29S2, and a channel region ch4. A poly Si gate electrode 27d has a contact window 31 and a narrow width channel region is located between regions 29D2 and 29S2 below gate electrode 27d with the intervention of a gate insulating SiO2 layer 26. The transistor area is formed by a field SiO2 layer under which a n type channel stopper region, 24 is formed.The above mentioned structural features of MISFET TPC are similar to features of MISFET TPB. However, in the case of TPC, n type channel stopper region 24, near the channel region ch4, cannot invade the channel region ch4 because a channel stopper retreat region 32b, shown by broken lines in Figure 4 a , is provided, so that effective channel width of the channel region ch4 can be maintained to a designed value. Moreover, the threshold voltage of theMISFET TPC can be maintained substantially the same as that of the MISFET TPB even though the channel width is as little as 2 microns. Wide channel width MISFET TNB and narrow channel width MISFET TNC have structures similar to those of TPB and TPC except that the former employ a p type channel stopper region 25. In the MISFET TNB, a transistor area consists of a drain region 28D1, a source region 28sly and a gate electrode 27a having a contact window 31 and an effective channel region chl having a wide channel width. InMISFET TNC, a transistor area consists of a drain region 28D2, a source region 28S2, a gate electrode 27b having a contact window 31 and an effective channel region ch2 having a narrow channel width, and a channel stopper retreat region 32a indicated by broken lines in Figure 4Xa . The function of the channel stopper retreat region 32a is similar to that of the channel stopper retreat region 32b of the MISFET TPC. The CMOSFET structure in Figures 4 a and 4 b can be fabricated easily, at low production cost, as illustrated in Figures 5 a , 5 b , 5 c , 5 d , 5 e and 5 f , in order, which give cross sectional views in channel width directions of channel regions of MISFETs as seen in Figures 4 a and 4 b . Figure 5 a shows silicon nitride Si3N4 layer patterns 42a to 42d and a first SiO2 layer 41 formed on, and a p type well 22 formed in, a substrate 21 as follows 1 providing n type Si substrate 21 having a resistivity of approximately 1 ohm cm 2 forming first SiO2 layer 41, with a thickness of 500 to 600 angstroms, on the substrate 21 3 forming the Si3N4 layer patterns 42a, 42b, 42c and 42d on the first siop layer 41 using chemical vapor deposition CVD and photo lithography so that theSi N layer patterns selectively cover respective transistor forming areas the Si N layer patterns 42b and 42d covering transistor forming areas for transistors having a narrow channel width such as 2 microns andSi3N4 layer patterns 42a and 42c covering transistor forming areas for transistors having a wide channel width such as 10 microns 4 selectively injecting boron lÏns at a 13 2 dose of approximately 1 x 10 ions cm 2 into the n typeSi substrate 21 using a resist mask which is not shown inFigure 5 a , the Si3N4 layer patterns 42a and 42b, and the first SiO2 layer 41, for forming the p type well 22 and 5 performing a designated annealing treatment in relation to the ion injected portion of substrate 21, so that the p type well 22 is formed with approximately 5 microns thickness. Figures 5 b and 5 c illustrate formation of a channel stopper retreat region as provided in this embodiment of the present invention. As seen in Figure 5 b , a first resist layer pattern 43a is selectively formed so as to cover over layer 41 the n Si substrate 21 outside the well 22 , and a second resist layer pattern 43b is selectively formed so as to cover over layer 41 a region of the p type well 22 destined for the formation of a transistor having a narrow channel width. The second resist layer pattern 43b is selectively formed so as to cover over layer 41 areas to both sides of the Si N layer pattern 42b as seen in Figure 5 b the coverage being such as to have an excess width wl beyond each side of layer pattern 42b of approximately 2.5 microns. The amount, 2.5 microns, of the excess width w1 is determined taking into consideration channel stopper region depth and positioning margin for succeeding patterning processes. Boron ions B are then selectively injected into the p type well region 22 at a dosage of approximately 5 x 1013 ions cm for forming a p type channel stopper region 125, which is shown in Figure 5 b , through the first SiO2 layer 41, using the first resist layer pattern 43a, the second resist layer pattern 43b, and the Si3N4 layer pattern 42a as masking. Broken lines 125 inFigures 5 b and 5 c indicate the B ion injection region. After removing the first and the second resist layer patterns 43a and 43b, a third resist layer pattern 44a is formed over layer 41 , as seen in Figure 5 c , so as to selectively cover the p type well 22. Also, a fourth resist layer pattern 44b is formed so as to selectively cover over layer 41 the Si3N4 layer pattern 42d on the n type Si substrate 21. The fourth resist layer pattern 44b is formed to selectively cover areas to both sides of the Si3N4 layer pattern 42d the coverage being such as to have an excess width wl of approximately 2.5 microns beyond each side of pattern 42d as seen inFigure 5 c . The amount, 2.5 microns, of excess width wl is determined in consideration of channel stopper region depth and positioning margin for succeeding patterning processes. Phosphorus ions P are then injected into the n type Si substrate 21 at a dosage of approximately 3 x 1012 ions cm 2, for forming a n type channel stopper region, through the first SiO2 layer 41, using the third resist layer pattern 44a, the fourth resist layer pattern 44b, and the Si3N4 layer pattern 42c as masking. Dashes 124 in Figure 5 c indicate the P ion injection region. After removing the third resist layer pattern 44a and the fourth resist layer pattern 44b, a field SiO2 layer 23 for separation of elements MISFETs of an IC is formed by selective oxidation using Si N layer patterns 42a, 42b, 42c and 42d as masking. Then, the ion injection region 125 and the P ion injection region 124 are activated and re distributed, so that a p type channel stopper region 25 and an n type channel stopper region 24 are formed respectively to depths extending as much as 0.8 micron below the field SiO2 layer 23. As indicated with reference to Figures 5 b and 5 c , when impurity ions such as the boron ions B or the phosphorus ions P are injected, the impurities are not injected into regions adjacent the ultimate channel regions of narrow channel width transistors TNC andTPC , because channel stopper regions 25 and 24 respectively relating to channel regions ch2 and ch4 are retreated from those channel regions to an extent w2 of at least 0.8 micron as a result of the covering processes used in relation to the resist layer patterns 43b and 44b. w2 is determined in consideration of the margin required in masking positioning and the lateral extension of the channel stopper region occurring in MISFET fabrication. Further processes for fabricating the CMOSFET structure are performed as explained with reference toFigures 5 e and 5 f . As seen in Figure 5 e , after removing Si3N4 layer patterns 42a, 42b, 42c and 42d and first SiO2 layer 41, a gate SiO2 layer 26 is formed by thermal oxidation, and poly Si gate electrodes 27a, 27b, 27c and 27d are formed using CVD and photo lithography processes. In Figure 5 e , cross sections of the poly Si gate electrodes in gate electrode width direction are seen. As indicated in Figure 5 f , arsenic ions As are selectively injected into the p type well 22 using the gate electrodes 27a and 27b and a resist layer pattern, which is not shown in Figure 5 f , as masking, and boron ions B are selectively injected into the n type Si substrate 21 using gate electrodes 27c and 27d and a resist layer pattern, which is not shown in Figure 5 f , as masking. Then, after a designated high temperature anneal treatment, n type source regions and n type drain regions, and p type source regions and p type drain regions are formed. The source and drain regions cannot properly be shown in Figure 5 f , because they are outside the plane of the cross sectional view of Figure 5 f . Accordingly, n type drain regions 28D1 and 28D2 and p type drain regions 29D1 and 29D2 are indicated by broken lines. Then, the CMOSFET structure is completed by forming insulating layers and circuit wiring not shown in Figure 5 f . As mentioned above, the n type wide channel widthMISFET TN B and the n type narrow channel width MISFET TNC are formed on in a p type well formed on in the semiconductor substrate and they constitute CMOSFETs with the p type wide channel width MISFET TPB or the p type narrow channel width MISFET TPC formed on the semiconductor substrate of the IC device. However, each of TN B and TNC can form a CMOSFET with only one of TPB and TPC. An integrated semiconductor circuit IC device comprising a metal insulator semiconductor field effect transistor MISFET having a narrow channel width, a field area for isolating a source region, a drain region, and a channel region of the MISFET from other electrical elements of the IC device, and a channel stopper region, formed in the field area, for avoiding flow of leakage current between the MISFET and other electrical elements of the IC device. The source and the drain regions are separately arranged with the channel region between them, and the channel stopper region has structure such that it directly touches the source and the drain regions but is spaced apart from the channel region so that impurities of the channel stopper region do not go into the channel region, so that threshold voltage of the MISFET is not increased even when its channel width is as little as 2 microns.
