# Gutters.

## Abstract
A connection between two gutter components is made between a connecting element 4 bonded to one of the components and a projecting portion of the other compo nent. A self supporting gasket 18 is disposed between the projecting portion and the connecting element 4 and the connection is made by bolts 22 which enter tapped bores in inserts 16 in the connecting element 4 . Each gutter component may comprise upper and lower skins 2, 12 which provide a cavity 14 filled with thermally insulating material. The component is formed by applying foamable material to the lower skin 12 and then placing the upper skin 2 on the lower skin 12 so that the edge regions of the skins 2, 12 are in contact. The foamable material then expands to fill the cavity 14 . The upper skin 2 is made from GRP by a pultrusion process.

## Description
GUTTERS This invention relates to a gutter assembled by interconnecting gutter components. Such gutters may be used, for example in the valleys between inclined roofs of industrial buildings. According to the present invention, the connection between two gutter components is made between a connecting element, including a tapped bore, which is bonded to one end of one of the gutter compontnets and a connecting portion at the adjacent end of the other gutter component, the connecting portion overlying the connecting element, and a self supporting gasket being disposed between the connecting portion and the connecting element, a bolt extending through an opening in the connecting portion into the tapped bore to secure the gutter components together. The connecting element may be made from glass reinforced plastics GRP in which case the tapped bore may be provided in a threaded metal insert. It is becoming increasingly common for the roofs of industrial buildings to be insulated. In order to extend the insulation to areas of the roof which are provided with gutters, the gutters themselves have also been insulated. Hitherto, this has been done by securing sections of insulating board to the underside of the gutter after installation of the gutter. This is a labour intensive operation and is not always effective. In addition, it creates difficulties in replacing damaged gutter sections. According to an embodiment in accordance with the present invention the gutter component comprises an upper skin, of water impervious material providing a trough for carrying rainwater, a lower skin, the edge regions of which engage the edge regions of the upper skin and the central region of which is spaced from the central region of the upper skin to provide a cavity between the upper and lower skins, and a body of thermally insulating material disposed within the cavity. The upper and lower skins may comprise glass reinforced plastics material GRP , and the insulating material may comprise foamed plastics material, such as polyisocyanurate foam. A convenient method of manufacturing a gutter component in accordance with the present invention begins with laying up the lower skin in a mould by applying a gel coat of a suitable resin to the surface of the mould. Glass fibre rovings are then sprayed onto the gel coat. The lower skin thus formed can be removed from the mould for storage if required.The upper skin may be formed by the so called pultrusion process, in which the material is pulled through a suitably shaped die under tension. When the complete gutter component is to be assembled, the lower skin is fitted into a mould which is capable of holding the lower skin rigid under pressure. A dosed quantity of foamable plastics material is deposited on the lower skin, and the upper skin is then clamped firmly, in sealing engagement, with the lower skin. Within a very short time, the foamable material begins to foam and expands to fill the cavity provided between the upper and lower skins.The foamed material bonds together the upper and lower skins, so that no further bonding is required at the adjoining edges of the upper and lower skins. For a better understanding of the present invention, and to show how it may be carried into effect, reference will now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 shows, in longitudinal cross section, two interconnected gutter components and Figure 2 is a sectional view taken on the lineII II of Figure 1. Each gutter component comprises an upper skin 2 which is made from GRP by means of the pultrusion process. Each upper skin 2 incorporates woven glass fibre matting, and to provide the necessary rigidity and strength there may be, for example, five layers of this matting. To one end of each upper skin 2 is bonded a connecting element 4. This element 4 is shown bonded to the left hand upper skin 2, but it will be appreciated that a similar connecting element 4 will be bonded to the right hand upper skin at the end which is not visible in Figure 1. The connecting element 4 comprises a rib 6 from which extend two flanges 8 and 10, the flange 8 being bonded to the upper skin 2. A lower skin 12 adjoins the upper skin 2 at its lateral edges. At one end, the lower skin 12 adjoins the flange 10 of the connecting element 4, and at the other end the lower skin 12 adjoins the upper skin 2 at a position spaced from the end of the upper skin 2, so that a portion of the upper skin 2 projects beyond the lower skin 12. The upper skin including the connecting element 4 and the lower skin provide a cavity 14 which is filled with a polyisocyanurate foam. The thickness of this cavity i.e. the distance between the upper skin 2 and the lower skin 12 is selected to provide the desired degree of thermal insulation as governed by current building practice and or regulations. At present, it is thought that a thickness of approximately 25 mm is sufficient for most purposes. The lower skin is made from GRP by laying up in the conventional manner in a suitably shaped mould.A gel coat is applied to the surface of the mould, and glass fibre rovings are sprayed on to the gel coat. The connecting element 4 is made from GRP in a hot press moulding process. A row of holes is provided across the width of the flange 10, and a threaded insert 16 is force fitted into each hole.Each insert 16 may have a serrated cylindrical surface in order to retain it against rotation in its hole.Between the upper skin 2 of the right hand gutter section and the flange 10 there is a self supporting gasket 18 which is bonded to the flange 10. This gasket 18 can, for example, be made from paper or board, as is commonly used for gaskets in automobile engines, or it may be made from bard rubber or other resilient materials. In the preferred construction, the upper skin 2 and the connecting element 4 can be formed with great accuracy, and so the gasket 18 does not have to be excessively resilient. In particular, the use of flowable sealants such as mastic can be avoided. The gasket 18 has, at each end, an upturned lip 20 which increases the pressure between the upper skin 2 and the flange 10 to improve the seal between these parts. The two gutter components are secured together by bolts 22 which pass through holes drilled in the upper skin 2, through pre punched holes in the gasket 18, and into the inserts 16. A rigid and water tight joint can thus be obtained, and it will be noted that the upper surfaces of the upper skins 2 and of the rib 6 are flush with one another. The Figures and the description given above relate to gutter components which are both thernally insulated and interconnected by the connecting element 4. However, it will be appreciated that the connecting element 4 can be used to interconnect gutter components which are not thermally insulated and which comprise, for example, only the upper skin 2. Similarly, thermally insulated.gutter components can be inteiconnected by means other than the connecting element 4.
