## Description
This invention relates in general to the preparation of maleic anhydride by oxidation of benzene benzol , and more particularly to a catalyst useful in the preparation of maleic anhydride. In conventional processes for the preparation of maleic anhydride by oxidation of benzene in vapor phase with an oxygen containing gas, supported catalysts are currently employed which comprise in most cases, as the active portion thereof, various combinations of metal oxides, such as vanadiummolybdenum, tin vanadium, iron chromium, chromiumvanadium, etc., with minor additions of some auxiliary compounds, and as the carrier portion thereof, non reactive particulate material, notably silica or alumina, which provide the required surface area, strength, and stability of the catalyst. The maleic anhydride catalysts used heretofore, comprised supports or carriers of either irregular shape, or preferably, shaped as balls or cylinders. While such known catalysts exhibit a satisfactory catalytic activity in the preparation of maleic anhydride, they are not entirely devoid of shortcomings, as connected with their potentiality and selectivity levels, as well as their capabilities to perform in mixtures at relatively high benzene concentrations. It is a principal object of the present invention to provide a catalyst for use in the preparation of maleic anhydride, which has improved properties over conventional catalysts as relates to its performances and in particular its potentiality and selectivity, even where benzene air mixtures of higher than normal concentrations are used. It is another object of the present invention, to provide a catalyst which has a higher activity or durability life . According to the present invention, there is provided a catalyst for use in the preparation of maleic anhydride by oxidation of benzene with an oxygen containing gas, comprising an active portion distributed over a support or carrier, characterized in that said support or carrier is selected from particles having an open and closed arcuate configuration. The detailed description which follows will serve to make the structure and advantages of the catalyst according to this invention more clearly understood. In the description, the expression potentiality of the catalyst refers to the amount of raw material which can be converted by contacting the catalyst per unit volume of catalyst in the reactor. Thus, the catalyst for the preparation of maleic anhydride comprises, in accordance with this invention, a support or carrier made up of open or closed arcuate shape particles. The arc defined by the support particle may be an arc of a circle, or of an ellipse, or parabola, etc., thereby said arc may have different radius portions. Preferably, the arc defined by the support particles is an arc of a circle, and the preferred support particles are those in the form of either half rings or full rings1 although other forms may be utilized in the present invention. Accordingly, in the following description, specific reference will be made to the half ring or full ring forms of the support, without the possible configurations for the catalyst support being limited to such forms. Of preference, rings are utilized whose outside diameters range from 4 to 8 mm, inside diameters from 1 to 6 mm, and lengths from 3 to 8 mm. By way of example, a preferred configuration of the ring has, in accordance with this invention, an outside diameter of 5 mm, an inside diameter of 2 mm, and a length of 5 mm. Half rings are preferably utilized which have outside diameters in the 4 to 10 mm range, inside diameters in the 1 to 8 mm range, and lengths in the 3 to 8 Z range. As an example, a preferred half ring configuration has, in accordance with the invention, an outside diameter of 7 mm, an inside diameter of 4 mm, and a length of 5 mm. The ring or half ring support of the catalyst of this invention has a geometric specific surface area geometric surface area per reactor unit volume which is higher than that of conventional supports or carriers for oxidizing benzene to maleic anhydride, affording a considerable improvement of the catalyst overall performance4 In Table 1 herein below, comparative data are given for the geometric surface areas provided by catalyst supports in the form of balls of various diameters, cylinders, and ring or half ring supports according to the invention.

Thus, for the same selectivity, it becomes possible to achieve a higher potentiality, in that one can have a larger amount of active mass in the reactor, correspondingly to the increased surface area of the support , without increasing the thick ness or depth of the catalytic layer.Thus, a higher flow rate of reactant to be treated e.g. benzene can be achieved for a given thickness of the catalytic layer in the reactor Table 2 herein below, illustrates in fact a comparison of the potentialities of conventional catalysts using knows supports, and of a catalyst according to this invention, said potentiality being expressed in terms of benzene mass flow rate versus the same given thickness or depth of the catalytic layer. TABLE 2Support TÃ¶taI geometric Benzene mass dimensions in mm. surface area in flow rate the reaction tube g hour m2 Rings, 5x2x5 1.13 146Half rings, 7x4x5 1.17 151Cylinders, 5x5 .93 120 Balls, Dia, 5 . .78 101 By converse, by maintaining a constant reactant feed at the start , relatively to other supports, it is possible to achieve, with the inventive catalysts, improved selectivities thanks to the possibility of having the same total amount of active catalytic mass in the tubev with a lower thickness of the catalytic layer, and accordingly less overoxidation phenomena actually, it is a well known fact that the thickness of the catalytic layer in a reactor is to reconcile conflicting requirements, since on one side, an increased thickness affords a larger active catalytic mass and a higher conversion output, whilst on the other side, a high thickness may result in overoxidation phenomena and the production of undesired byproducts. Thus, it is of import that a catalyst should present a larger active mass distributed over a thinner catalytic layer, which is indeed accomplished by the catalyst according to this invention. Of course, the catalyst of this invention ensures a simultaneous increase of both the potentiality and selectivity of the catalyst with a smaller thickness catalytic layer with respect to conventional supports and a slightly lower feed than shbwn inTable 2, but still much higher than is afforded by other conventional supports. A smaller thickness or depth of the active portion results in a temperature pattern through the catalytic bed, for a given set of conditions, which is flatter than in conventional catalysts. Thus for example, for the same feed, the catalyst of this invention enables one to operate at lower temperatures, and temperature peaks can be avoided in the catalytic mass which would affect the desired product yield. By virtue of said flatter temperature pattern, and accordingly reduced thermal stresses, it also becomes possible to operate at higher concentrations of benzene in air, and to achieve a longer life or durability of the catalyst activity than in conventional catalysts. Por manufacturing the supports or carriers of the catalysts according to this invention, any inert material may be utilized which is normally used in the manufacture of catalyst supports, such as alumina, with the addition of minor amounts of silica and oxides of alkaline and alkaline earth metals, or silicates e.g. steatite .An exemplary composition of a support or carrier useful in implementing this invention is the following Al2 3 87.02 percent SiO2 9.63 TiO2 .85 CaO 1.38 Fe203 .52 MgO .12 NaSO .21 2 .27 2 The method for preparing the catalyst is characterized in that it comprises the following steps a porous support is impregnated with a solution of the active catalyst components, then dried for 7 to 8 hours at a temperature below 100 CS and finally calcined at a temperature above 4000C for 3 to 7 hours in an enclosed environment. The active mass of the catalyst for the preparation of maleic anhydride, to be used in conjunction with the catalytic support according to the invention preferably comprises, as its basic components, molybdenum oxide and vanadium oxide, with the addition of various auxiliary components having promoting, stabilizing, and other functions.The composition of the active mass of the catalyst, as expressed in terms of parts by weight of oxides in the starting materials for the preparation of the catalyst, may vary within the following ranges MoO3, 1 V205, 1.2 2.5 Bi203, 0.02 0.64 P205, 0.020.05 Na2O, 0.03 0.06 NiO, 0.03 0.06. An exemplary composition may be the following I part O0 2.1 parts V205 0.03 parts P205 0.04 parts Na20 0.04 parts NiO and 0.06 parts By 203. The advantages to be secured with the catalysts of this invention will be illustrated by the examples which follow, by way of illustration only and not of limitation of the invention true scope.EXAMPLE 1 Preparation of the Catalysts In a suitable vessel of an acid resistant material, there are introduced 71.43 parts by weight of 33 concentrated hydrochloric acid, 6.07 parts of ammonium paramolybdate, and 13.22 parts of ammonium metavanadate, which are then stirred for a few minutes. The following solutions are prepared in suitable vessels in a first vessel, a solution of .79 parts trisodium phosphate dodecahydrate in 3,59 parts water, in a second vessel, a solution of .64 parts bismuth nitrate pentahydrate in 1.28 parts water and in a third vessel, .71 parts nickel nitrate hexahydrate in 2.27 parts H20. These three solutions are then added to the hydrochloric solution prepared in the first mentioned vessel, and the whole is stirred occasionally until the time of using it. With this solution, some supports are impregnated which have the same chemical composition but different shapes and dimensions. One operates with different amounts of the solution for each support, taking into account the different specific geometric surface areas of the supports, such as to maintain the thickness or depth of the active catalytic layer on the carriers practically at the same value. The coating operation is carried out by slow evaporation of the solution in accordance with conventional practices. Finally, the catalyst is calcined at above 4000C for 4 hours in an enclosed environment. The characteristics of the resulting catalysts are indicated in the following table.
