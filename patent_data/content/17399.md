# A window lining arrangement, particularly for inclined windows.

## Abstract
In a window lining the corner between two adjoining planer lining members 1 and 2 is tightened by a wedge effect provided by engagement between a displaceable rail 12 on the first member 1 and a rail 9 fixed on the second member 2 . After the mounting of said second member the first members can be brought into its place adjacent the fixed rail 9 and can be tightened by hammer blows which may be transmitted to the end of the displaceable rail 12 via a thin punch so that the gap between the lining and the wall surrounding the window opening may be correspondingly narrow.
