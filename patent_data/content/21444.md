# Process for producing two carbon atom oxygenated compounds from synthesis gas with minimal production of methane.

## Abstract
A process for selectively preparing a mixture of two carbon atom oxygenated hydrocarbons, namely, acetic acid, ethanol and acetaldehyde, by continously contacting a gaseous reaction mixture containing hydrogen and carbon monoxide with a solid catalyst comprising rhodium in combination with one or more alkali metals selected from the group consisting of lithium, potassium, cesium and rubidium at reaction conditions correlated so as to favor the formation of a substantial proportion of such two carbon atom products.
