# Display tube.

## Abstract
In a display tube comprising an envelope 10 having parallel front and rear walls 12 and 14 containing implosion preventing support walls 22 dividing the envelope into a plurality of modules, each module includes a low current electron emitter 24 , for example a thermionic wire emitter, a switching electrode arrangement 25 comprising a plurality of electrode carrying layers each having a plurality of apertures spaced in a row vertically of the module which apertures serve to define one of a plurality of electron beam paths directed towards a cathodoluminescent screen carried on the front wall 12 , and a channel electron multiplier intermediate the switching electrode arrangement 25 and the screen for beam current multiplication. The switching electrode arrangement comprises a stack of mutually insulated electrodes associated with each aperture selectively operable to allow or prevent electrons to pass therethrough thereby to effect frame scanning, line scanning and electron acceleration being achieved by means of electrodes 32, 34, 36 carried by the support walls 22 .
