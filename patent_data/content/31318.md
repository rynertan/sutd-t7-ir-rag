## Abstract
An apparatus for cutting cigar wrappers with a preselected shape from a natural tobacco leaf L comprises a vacuum supporting structure on a leaf receiving member 300 . An arrangement is provided for selecting a cut position on the leaf and oriented with respect to the leaf receiving member 300 and a cutting table 750 is provided including a leaf supporting surface 752b and an arrangement for creating a vacuum on the surface to support a leaf. The table is positioned in a known leaf receiving location and a transfer means 202 is provided for transferring the leaf from the leaf receiving member 300 to the leaf supporting surface of the cutting table. A cutter 810a is provided for cutting the preselected shape from the leaf. The table 750 is then shifted from its leaf receiving position to a leaf cutting position with the support surface 752b of the table 750 spaced from the wrapper cutter 810a . After orienting the platen relative to the cutter to align the cutter with the cut position for the leaf the cutter is forced against the table 750 to cut a wrapper from the leaf. The wrapper is then moved and transferred by transfer device 870 to a selected location for subsequent use.
