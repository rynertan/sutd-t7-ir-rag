# Production of aluminum lithium alloy by continuous addition of lithium to molten aluminum stream.

## Abstract
A continuous process for forming aluminum lithium alloys is disclosed which comprises continuously monitoring the ingot casting rate and continuously adding 26 a measured and controlled amount of molten lithium beneath the surface of a molten aluminum stream 12 as it flows toward an ingot casting station 300 . The amount of molten lithium to be added is based on the ingot 320 casting rate, the ingot size and the lithium content of the alloy being cast.
