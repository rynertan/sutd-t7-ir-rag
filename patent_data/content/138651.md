The reference circuit 500 also helps to limit custom resistors in each xi otherwise required because of the different loads, depending on how many emitter contacts are connected to each x line in the ROM. Only a constant resistor is required for each of 200 X addresses, shortening layout time for the ROM 400. Base 502 of transistor QB1 draws very little current, and 10 is essentially equal to 10. Figure 7 shows reference circuit 520, which is connected to node B Figure 5 . Emitter 522 is set at 3vbe Due to high current requirements for the microprocessor integrated circuit 50, i.e., a total Iinj of about 1.4A, careful control of voltage drops in both injection and ground busses 602 and 604, respectively, is important. In order to maintain proper biasing for all parts of the integrated circuit 50, a maximum voltage difference of 25mV on all the I2L transistors VBE must be maintained over the operating temperature range of the the integrated circuit 50. Figures 8 and 9 show details of I2L power distribution in the microprocessor integrated circuit. For the injector busses 602, voltage drops across the busses 602 is accounted for in the value of the drop off resistors 606 Figure 8 The value of the drop off resistor 606 will determine the current in the injector branch 608, which is set by the number of I 2L transistors connected to that branch 608. For ground busses 604, normally the width of the ground busses 604 is increased, hence reducing ohmic voltage drop to approach a perfect ground, zero voltage everywhere.However, in order to achieve this result, the size of the busses 604 would be prohibitively large, due to the high currents involved. In accordance with this invention, ground balancing is achieved to overcome this limitation. Rather than attempting to reduce the ground voltage to zero, the actual ground voltage is raised to some reference voltage valueVGref through a ground balancing resistor 610. The voltage drop across the main ground busses 604 is therefore accounted for through the value of that resistor 610. In order to maintain the chip 50 total power dissipation to a minimum, it is essential to maintain VGref as small as possible. The value of VGref is determined by essentially the maximum voltage drop VGMAX across the main ground bus 604 and the maximum voltage drop VGR across a ground balancing resistor closest to the point of VGMAX. The value of VGR in turn is determined by ground current Ig and the minimum achievable resistor value Rmin. Figure 10 shows the register file data path bus structure 600 forming a part of the invention. The busing structure shown in Figure 10 is implemented in the microprocessor circuit 50 for its data path. The busing structure reflects a two level addressing scheme, i.e., main address and local address. The main address determines the inputs to the ALU, erg., register file, IR, MDR, IC, MAR, or the like. In the register file, a local address determines the particular register being selected. The addressing scheme is identical for the two inputs to the ALU A and B busses . Operation of only one of these busses will therefore be explained. A 5 bit address 1 of 32 is required for addressing the register file 82, 5 bits for the A address and 5 bits for the B address. Two pages each consist of up to 16 registers 622, addressed in parallel usinq 4 bit addresses 1 of 16 . Each page is connected to a separate local bus 624. The fifth address bit is combined with the register file 82 main address select signal in order to select, i.e., multiplex one of the two local busses 624 onto the main bus 626. Fundamentally, this busing scheme reduces the total propagation delay. A simple bus structure may have all registers connected into a single local bus. The local bus will then have a total loading capacitance of a maximum of 32 collectors, in addition to wire capacitance. Using a two local bus 624 structure instead reduces the capacitance on each local bus by a factor of two. As a result, there is about an 8 nanosecond reduction in local bus access time.The simplified address decoder l of 16 instead of l of 32 reduces the propagation delay in an ALU cycle by one additional gate delay. Therefore the above described addressing scheme reduces the propagation delay in an ALU cycle by approximately 12 nanoseconds. Some additional benefits in chip layout are obtained through use of the busing scheme. Each register requires three control signals, i.e., one clock signal WRITE and two out enable signals for dual port registers READ . Using the two local bus scheme, two registers may share the same READ signals, but not WRITE signals, therefore reducing the number of control signals by a third. The number of control signals is particularly important in the chip layout, since it will determine the width of the data path.That saving in chip area offsets to a great extent the increase in area due to the additional local bus per bit. Figure 11 shows an improved latch dual port random access memory RAM circuit 900 used in the register file 82 of the microprocessor integrated circuit 50. In place of theD type flip flop normally used for this purpose, the circuit 900 provides a number of advantages. A dual port D type flip flop requires 12 gates to implement, and the circuit 900 only requires 10 gates. In terms of the microprocessor integrated circuit 50 of this invention, the significance of this reduction in gates is shown by the fact that 25 of the I2L gates in the microprocessor integrated circuit 50 are in the register file. The two gate saving in each cell of the register file results in a 15 reduction in input power for each cell and a 10 reduction in cell area. Implementing the register file cells with latches required solving a timing problem and a problem with glitches in the latch output signal. The timing problem arises from the fact that data input to the register file is shared by other registers on a common input data bus. These other registers are implemented in D type flip flop form, and they are edge triggered. It is therefore necessary to generate a special latch enable signal EN from the main clock pulse used in edge triggering the D flip flops of the other registers.The pulse width of the EN signal is adjusted so that only the proper data input is latched into a cell 900. The EN signal is generated from the circuits shown in Figures 16 and 17, as explained above. Corrective action was also required in order to avoid a glitch in the latch output signals QA and QB following the leading edge of the EN signal. Since the output enable signal OEA or OEB reaches the register file from the address decoder later in the cycle after the data has been latched into the register file, no glitches will appear on the register file output busses. The dual port latch cell 900 shown in Figure 11 consists of a basic latch cell 920, comprising gates 1 5, with an input buffer 922, consisting of gate 8, and two output gates 924, consisting of gates 6 and 7. There are also output enable buffers 926, consisting of gates 9 and 10.If desired, the output gates 924 can be connected to gate 5 to change the polarity of the output signals QA and QB. In operation, as the latch enable signal EN becomes assertive, active low , the latch 920 becomes transparent and the input data D are latched on gates 4 and 5. The latch outputs 924 remain open circuit as long as the output enable signals D l and Z S are non assertive. The latch enable signal EN may now be turned non assertive, and the latch 920 becomes non transparent. The output enable signals OEA andOEB may become assertive active low at any time and the latched data on gates 4 and 5 are transferred to QA and QB outputs, independently of one another. During the WRITE operation, a glitch may appear at the output of gate 4. That glitch will not appear at the QA and QB outputs if the READ operation is allowed to lag behind WRITE operations by more than two gate delays. Figure 12 shows a D type flip flop circuit 700 with asynchronous clear and preset in accordance with the invention. Figure 13 is a truth table for the circuit 700.Figures 14 16 are waveform diagrams useful for understanding operation of the circuit 700.The flip flop 700 has a master section 702 and a slave section 704. The outputs of the master section 702 are at nodes A and B. The inputs of the slave section are at nodes A, B, C and D. The CLK clock input signal controls both the master and slave sections 702 and 704. Operation of the circuit 700 will now be explained, with reference to Figures 13 16. When the V clk waveform 720 Figure 14 is less than V m , the minimum master loading voltage, the outputs of the master section 702 are fixed regardless of any change in the inputs at node D. Therefore, nodes A and B can only be changed when waveform 720 is greater than V m . When waveform 720 is greater than V s , the maximum slave loading voltage, the inputs of the slave section 704 at nodes C and D assume control, independently of the state of nodes A and B. Therefore, outputs from the master section 702 can be loaded to slave section 704 only when waveform 720 is less than V s . Since the circuit 700 is negative edge triggered,V m is always larger than V s . Inputs to the master section are controlled by the clock pulse 720. The clock pulse 720 also regulates the state of the coupling transistors 730 which connect the master and slave sections 702 and 704. The sequence of operation is as follows at point 732, isolate slave 704 from master 702 at point 734, enter information from D input to master section 702 at point 736, disable D input at point 738, transfer information from master section 702 to slave section 704. For asynchronous clear and reset, asynchronous inputs are as follows HIGH input to CLEAR sets Q to LOW level HIGH input to PRESET sets Q to HIGH level simultaneous HIGH on CLEAR and PRESET makes both outputsHIGH. Also, the asynchronous CLEAR and PRESET inputs will force the flip flop 700 into a fixed state, regardless of previous state, independently of clock waveform 720. TheCLEAR and PRESET inputs are designed to reduce current hogging, even if a series of CLEAR and PRESET inputs are tied together. Figure 17 shows a block diagram of circuits 800, 802 and 804, comprising a three input AND gate 800, a two input WAND gate 802 and a set 804 of inverters 806. Figure 18 shows details of isoplanar 12L, i.e., 13L trademark ofFairchild Camera and Instrument Corporation latch enable circuits 800, 802 and 804. Figure 19 shows waveforms 830, 832 and 834 used in the circuits 800, 802 and 804. The three inputs to AND gate 800 will generate a signal through the AND gate 800 at node A. The signal at node A is delayed by the inverters 806 to give a signal at node B. The NAND gate 802 utilizes the signals at nodes A and B to generate a negative going pulse 834 at its output 810. The width of this pulse 834 is controlled by the gate delays of the inverters 806. However, the polarity of the pulse 834 is determined by the output WAND gate 802. Figures 20 and 21 provide further details on the generation of the three inputs to AND gate 800 in the latch enable timing circuits of Figure 17. A clock pulse CP is supplied to D flip flop circuits 1000, 1002 and 1004, through inverter amplifier 1006. System timing signals are provided to the D inputs of the flip flops 1000 1004 on lines 1008, 1010 and 1012. The Q outputs of flip flops 1000 1004 on lines 1014, 1016 and 1018 constitute the three inputs to AND gate 800. These Q outputs are also supplied on lines 1020, 1022 and 1024 to AND gate 1026. AND gate 1026 provides an additional set of A pulses on line 1028 for edge triggering the D flip flop 700 Figure 12 also used in register file 82. Figure 21 shows the timing relationship between the clock pulses CP and the A and B pulses.
