# ALUMINOBOROSILICATE GLASSES AND THEIR USE AS PROTECTIVE AND LUBRICATING COATINGS IN THE HEAT TREATMENT OF METALS

## Abstract
The coatings are glass compositions which consist es sentially of from 18 to 45 mol of the alkaline oxides CaO and one or both of Na₂O and K₂O and from 5 to 22 mol of Al₂O₃, the balance being B₂O₃ and SiO₂ in such amounts that the mo lar ratio of B₂O₃ B₂O₃ SiO₂ lies in the range from 0.575 1 to 0.85 1. These compositions are particularly suitable for use dur ing the heat treatment and hot working of titanium and its al loys.
