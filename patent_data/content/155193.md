# Methods of assay.

## Abstract
In its broadest aspect, the present invention provides a method of assaying a ligand in a sample which comprises contacting the sample with a predetermined quantity of a specific binding partner to the ligand, said specific binding partner being immobilized on the effective gate electrode of a field effect transistor, and determining whether and, if de sired, the extent to which an appropriate transistor charac teristic is changed as a result of complex formation between the ligand and the specific binding partner.
