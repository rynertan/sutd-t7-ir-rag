# AN IGNITION CONTROLLING MEANS FOR A LINEAR OR ROTARY TYPE OF ENGINE

## Abstract
An ignition controlling means for a linear or rotary engine comprises means to sense the vacuum in the engine intake and convert the so sensed value of vacuum into a corresponding analog or digital signal means to sense the engine speed and convert the so sensed value of engine speed into a corresponding analog or digital signal means for storing ignition timing correction values and means for comparing the vacuum and speed signals with the stored correction values and generating a servo driving signal for adjustment of the ignition timing of the engine.
