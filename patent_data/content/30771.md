## Abstract
A novel process for the preparation of 6 aminopenicillanic acid 1,1 dioxide and its non toxic, phar maceutically acceptable salts by deacylation of a penicillin 1,1 dioxide or its salts of which the 3 carboxylic acid is pro tected by such an easily removable group that a one pot process is possible.
