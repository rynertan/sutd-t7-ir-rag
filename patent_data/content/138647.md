# SOLID STATE X RAY RECEPTOR AND METHOD OF MAKING SAME

## Abstract
An X ray receptor for producing electrical signals repre sentative of an X ray image. An array of semiconductor el ements is mounted on at least one support, each element being formed of semiconductor material which is 1 an element of Group 4A of the Periodic Table of Elements or a compound of such an element, or which is 2 at least one element of Group 3A of the Periodic Table of Elements together with at least one element of Group 5A of the Periodic Table of Elements, and having at least one PN junction therein. The array is positioned to receive impinging X rays and to produce electrical signals in response thereto. Electrical conducting leads are supported on the support, and the electrical signals which are produced by respective one of the semiconductor elements are coupled to these electrical conducting leads. Output terminals also are supported on the support to provide output image signals and circuitry including multiplexing circuits additionally is sup ported on the support for processing and multiplexing the elec trical signal from the electrical conducting leads to the output terminals. Also disclosed is a method by which the X ray recep tor is made.
