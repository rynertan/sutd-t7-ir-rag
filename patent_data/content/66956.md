# Enkephalinase enzyme inhibiting compounds.

## Abstract
Chiral 2 2 benzyl 3 mercaptopropionylamino 1 alkanol derivatives and chiral 2 2 benzyl 3 mercaptopropionyl amino 4 methylthiobutyric acids are inhibitors of en kephalinase enzyme, reflecting their clinical utility as analgesics or anticonvulsant agents, or as therapy for disorders in which endogenous enkephalin levels are below normal.
