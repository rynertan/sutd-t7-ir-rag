## Description
The present invention is concerned with a process for removing one or more contaminants of the formula TiCl₃OR in which r is an alkyl or aryl group from a liquid phase conprising TiCl₄. Whilst it would in principle be possible to remove these compounds by fractional distillation of the liquid phase, this method is however not adequately energy efficient and in cases where the contaminants have a boiling point close to that of TiCl₄, this being so for TiCl₃OC₂H₅, the distillation route requires elaborate equipment and is not easy to implement in industrial plants. A simpler method is therefore desirable and the technical problem underlying this invention is to achieve this. The TiCl₄ working up method of this invention is based on the following principles According, the invention provides a process for removing one or more contaminants of the formulatTiCl₃OR, in which R is an alkyl or aryl group, from a liquid phase comprising TiCl₄, characterized in that the contaminants are reacted with an organic acid halide R C Whilst the invention includes the use of a binary liquid phase system comprising TiCl₄ and TiCl₃OR components, it is preferred to employ a liquid phase that in addition contains a liquid halohydrocarbon diluent, provided the presence of this diluent does not bring about a substantial modification of the limited solubility of the envissaged addition complex in the liquid phase. When halohydrocarbons are employed, preferred weight ratios to TiCl₄ vary in the range of from 30 70 to 70 30. Suitable halohydrocarbons are aliphatic halohydrocarbons with up to 12 carbon atoms, e.g. 1,2 dichlorethane, trichloropropane, hexachloroethane, tetrachloromethane, 2 chlorobutane, 1 chloroisooctane, etc. and aromatic halohydrocarbons, e.g. 2,3 dichloronaphthene, 1,2 1,3 or 1,4 dichlorobenzene, 2 chlorotoluene or monochlorobenzene, the latter being a preferred compound. The organic acid halide can be selected from aromatic and aliphatic acid halides, from the latter group of compounds those in which R represents an alkyl group with from 1 to 12 carbon atoms, e.g. ethyl, n propyl, isopropyl, hexyl or cyclohexyl are preferred. Particularly suitable are acid halides in which R represents substituted or unsubstituted phenyl. Most preferred is benzoychloride. In the complex nTiCl₄.R C These values can be produced by adjusting the amount of organic acid halide to be added to the contaminated TiCl₄ comprising a known amount of TiCl₃OR. The concentration of the latter in the liquid phase shall normally be less than 300 g kg TiCl₄ and more than 15 g kg TiCl₄. In the most preferred reactions one will employ the acid halide in a stoichiometric amount, thus enabling the reaction TiCl₃OR R C This reaction proceeds rapidly when the temperature of the liquid phase is above 60 C, preferably at least 90 C. At lower temperatures, more time is needed for the required conversion. At the aforesaid elevated temperatures the addition complex is relatively soluble in the liquid phase, however, a rapid precipitation occurs when the liquid phase is cooled to a temperature of less than 15 C. At higher temperatures the precipitation is more slowly and less quantitative. The process of the invention is of particular interest for the preparation of solid catalyst components for the polymerization of 1 alkenes, such as ethylene, propylene, butene 1, octene 1, etc., based upon the halogenation of e.g. magnesiumalkoxy or aryloxychloride or magnesiumdialkoxide or diaryloxide with TiCl₄ in the presence of a liquid halohydrocarbon as disclosed in EP 19330. Upon filtering the liquid phase to isolate the solid product of the halogenation reaction one obtains a liquid phase comprising TiCl₄, a halohydrocarbon and a contaminating compound of the formula TiCl₃OR. The process of EP 19330 further prescribes a second step to produce the desired solid catalyst component. This step involves the reaction of the aforesaid solid reaction product with liquid TiCl₄. In that reaction the co presence of TiCl₃OR contaminants is not desired but when these contaminants are removed with the process of this invention the purified liquid TiCl₄ can very well be used as the reactant for the second step of the process of EP 19330. Accordingly this invention is also concerned with a process for preparing a solid catalyst component for 1 alkene polymerization which comprises It is preferred to carry out the first reaction step in the co presence of an electron donor Lewis base , preferably an aromatic ester of an aliphatic alcohol, e.g. ethylbenzoate. The liquid phase obtained in step 6 may be recycled into step 1 , optionally following purification in line with the method of steps 3 and 4 . The latter would be particularly useful if in step 3 an excess of organic acid halide instead of the stoiciometric amount is employed. In polymerizing 1 alkenes, particular propylene or mixtures of propylene and up to 20 mol of ethylene the solid catalyst components may be applied in any manner known per se, preference is given to the method disclosed in EP 19330. The best catalyst systems comprise as co catalyst a combination of a trialkylaluminium compound and an aromatic ester of an aliphatic alcohol, e.g. one of the compounds referred to in GB A 1,387,890, preferably p.ethoxyethylbenzoate or p.methoxyethylbenzoate. Instead of using a single trialkylaluminium compound one may also employ such compound in admixture with a dialkylaluminium halide. The invention is illustrated by the following examples 135 g of magnesiumethoxychloride and 61 g of ethylbenzoate are stirred in 4.3 kg of a 50 50 vol mixture of TiCl₄ and monochlorobenzene at 100 C during 1.5 hours. 175 g of solid reaction product A is removed from the liquid phase to which 183 g of benzoylchloride is added at 95 C. The liquid phase is stirred at 95 C for 10 min, then cooled to 10 C to precipitate 485 g of the solid yellow complex TiCl₄.C₆H₅COOC₂H₅. Subsequent to filtration, the volume ratio of the liquid phase is readjusted to 50 50 by addition of 285 g of TiCl₄ and product A is dispersed in the latter liquid phase. The temperature is increased to 105 C and the dispersion is stirred during 3 hours. Upon filtration 172 g of the solid product A are washed with isopentane at 30 C during 1.5 hours. 150 g of magnesiumethoxychloride and 57 g of ethylbenzoat are stirred in 4.5 kg of a 50 50 vol. mixture of TiCl₄ and monochlorobenzene at 105 C during 1.7 hours. 172 g of solid reaction product B is removed from the liquid phase to which 370 g of benzoylchloride is added at 90 C. The liquid phase is stirred at 90 C for 20 min., then cooled to 15 C to precipitate 970 g of the solid yellow complex TiCl₄.C₆H₅COOC₂H₅. Subsequent to filtration, the volume ratio of the liquid phase is readjusted to 50 50 by addition of 560 g of TiCl₄ and product B is dispersed in the latter liquid phase. The temperature is increased to 100 C and the dispersion is stirred during 2.7 hours. Upon filtration 169 g of the solid product B are washed with isopentane at 25 C during 1.7 hours. Solids A and B were tested as solid catalyst components for liquid propylene polymerization using the following standard conditions
