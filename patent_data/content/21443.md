## Description
BACKGROUND This invention concerns an improvement in the selective preparation of two carbon atom oxygenated hydrocarbons, namely acetic acid, ethanol, and or acetaldehyde, from synthesis gas. More particularly, the invention concerns the reaction of synthesis gas in the presence of a rhodium sodium catalyst under heterogeneous reaction conditions correlated to produce such two carbon atom products. The preparation of hydrocarbons and oxygenated hydrocarbons from synthesis gas essentially a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen has received extensive study and has achieved commercial adoption. Reaction conditions generally involve temperatures on the order of 150 450 C, pressures from atmospheric to about 10,000 psig, and hydrogen to carbon monoxide ratios in the range of 4 1 to about 1 4, with an iron group or a noble metal group hydrogenation catalyst. One serious disability of most synthesis gas processes for the production of oxygenated hydrocarbons containing two or more carbon atoms has been the nonselective or non specific nature of the product distribution. Catalysts which possess acceptable activity generally tend to give a wide spectrum of products, for example, hydrocarbons and oxygenated hydrocarbons having a broad distribution of carbon atom contents. This not only complicates the recovery of desired products, but results in the wastage of reactants to commercially uninteresting byproducts. United Kingdom Patent No. 1,501,892 is directed to a process for selectively preparing a mixture of twocarbon atom oxygenated compounds, namely, acetic acid, ethanol and acetaldehyde, using a rhodium catalyst.United Kingdom Patent No. 1,501,891 describes a process for favoring the production of ethanol relative to acetic acid and acetaldehyde by incorporating iron into the rhodium based catalyst. U. S. Patent Nos. 4,096,164, 4,014,913 and copending application Serial No. 841,054 filed October 11, 1977, concern themselves with enhancing the productivity and or varying the distribution of the aforementioned two carbon atom oxygenated compounds by the addition of elements such as molybdenum and or tungsten, manganese, and thorium and or uranium, respectively, to the rhodium based catalyst. Rhodium catalysts supported on carriers containing sodium, among other materials, have been used for the production of oxygenated hydrocarbons from synthesis gas. In the aforementioned United KingdomPatent 1,501,892, Table V describes the various rhodium catalysts used in the experiments of the patent, several of which catalysts are shown to have been supported on Davison 59 silica gel. The chemical composition of such Grade 59 silica gel is provided in GraceTechnical Bulletin IC 773 15 which indicates the presence of 0.10 weight Na20 corresponding to 0.074 wt. Na in the gel. A lower sodium value for gels of this type is disclosed in Grace Technical Bulletin 202 1958 at page 2, where a sodium level of 0.02 weight is indicated to be typical of Davison silica gels.In The Journal of Catalysis, Vol. 54, pp. 120 128 1978 ,Bhasin et al. disclose synthesis gas reactions with rhodium catalysts supported on Davison Grace 59 silica gel. At page 121, Table 1 of this publication, the sodium content of the silica gel support is reported to be 0.085 weight . Thus, the sodium content of silica gel supports of the type used in conjunction with the rhodium catalysts described in the aforementioned United Kingdom patent and the Bhasin et al disclosure is reported in the technical literature to be as low as 0.02 weight and as high as 0.085 weight An undesirable feature of the synthesis gas process disclosed in the aforementioned patents andThe Journal of Catalysis publication is the production of methane along with the desired two carbon atom oxygenated hydrocarbons.In general, the greater the efficiency of the reaction to methane, the lower the production of the desired oxygenated hydrocarbons.Since methane is a significantly less valuable commercial chemical than either ethanol, acetic acid or acetaldehyde, methane formation is economically undesirable. Moreover, inasmuch as carbon monoxide and hydrogen, the reactants in these processes, are generally produced commercially by steam reforming of methane, the formation of methane, in turn, from synthesis gas necessarily detracts from the overall process efficiency. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention describes a catalyst for the production of two carbon atom oxygenated hydrocarbons from the reaction of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The catalyst of the invention acts to inhibit methane formation and shift the distribution of two carbon atom oxygenated hydrocarbons produced by the reaction in favor of acetic acid while retaining the selectivity of the overall reaction toward such two carbon atom compounds. The process of the invention involves contacting a catalyst comprising rhodium in combination with sodium under suitable reaction conditions with synthesis gas to selectively produce acetic acid, ethanol and or acetaldehyde, the concentration of sodium in the catalyst being at least 0.1 weight percent.The catalyst may optionally be combined with an alkali metal such as lithium, potassium, cesium or rubidium to inhibit methane formation as a coproduct among the desired oxygenated compounds. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the catalyst additionally contains manganese to improve the rate of the reaction with regard to the formation of two carbon atom products. PROCESS DISCUSSION The reaction is conducted at reaction conditions of temperature, pressure, gas composition and space velocity. correlated so as to collectively produce acetic acid, ethanol, and or acetaldehyde in an amount which is at least about 50 weight percent, preferably at least about 75 weight percent, of the two or more carbon atom compounds obtained by the reaction. Desirably, the reaction is conducted at these correlated conditions to achieve carbon efficiencies to the specified products based on carbon consumption in excess of 10 , and frequently in excess of 50 . At optimum reaction conditions, and particularly at relatively low conversions, there is little conversion to three carbon atom and higher hydrocarbons and oxygenated hydrocarbons, and conversion to methane and methanol may be minimized. The reaction efficiency, or selectivity to the two carbon atom compound is at least about 10 , s and is usually upwards of about 25 under the preferred conditions it exceeds 50 and, under optimum conditions, can reach 90 or more. Selectivity is defined herein as the percentage of carbon atoms converted from carbon monoxide to a specified compound or compounds other than CO2. Thus, the independent reaction variables are correlated so as to favor the formation of a substantial proportion of the desired two carbon atom oxygenated hydrocarbons acetic acid, ethanol, and acetaldehyde .This proportion, expressed as carbon conversion efficiency, is usually greater than 25 and frequently exceeds 50 . In one aspect of the invention, this correlation is a combination of conditions which result in maintaining moderate reaction conditions to thereby limit the conversion of CO to not more than about one fourth, preferably not more than about one eighth, such fractional conversion being expressed on a single pass basis. As will be discussed in detail below, this may be achieved primarily by a combination of high space velocity and low temperature, but other factors e.g.,H2 CO ratio, catalyst activity, pressure, bed geometry, etc. also affect the conversion. At high conversions, it has been noted that hydrocarbons and higher carbon number oxygenated hydrocarbons are produced in excess, with a resulting loss in efficiency to two carbon atom compounds. Conditions of temperature, of pressure, and of gas composition are usually within the ranges that are essentially conventional for synthesis gas conversions, particularly those employed in the production of methanol.Thus, existing technology and, in some instances, existing equipment may be used to effect the reaction. The reaction is highly exothermic, with both the thermodynamic equilibrium and the kinetic reaction rates being governed by the reaction temperature.Average catalyst bed temperatures are usually within the range of about 150 4500C., but for optimum conversions, bed temperatures are kept within the range of about 200 4000C., typically about 250 3500C. The reaction temperature is an important process variable, affecting not only total productivity but selectivity toward one or more of the desired twocarbon atom products. Over relatively narrow temperature ranges, as for example 10 or 20 C., an increase in temperature may somewhat increase total synthesis gas conversion, tending to increase the efficiency of ethanol production and decrease the efficiency of acetic acid and acetaldehyde production. At the same time, however, higher temperatures favor methane production, and apparently methane production increases much more rapidly at higher temperatures than do conversions to the more desirable two carbon atom products.Thus, for a given catalyst and with all other variables held constant, the optimum temperature will depend more on product and process economics than on thermodynamic or kinetic considerations, with higher temperatures tending to increase the production of oxygenated products but disproportionately increasing the co production of methane. In the discussions above, the indicated temperatures are expressed as average, or mean, reaction bed temperatures. Because of the highly exothermic nature of the reaction, it is desirable that the temperature be controlled so as not to produce a runaway methanation, in which methane formation is increased with higher temperature, and the resulting exotherm increases the temperature further. To accomplish this, conventional temperature control techniques are utilized, as for example the use of fluidized bed reaction zones, the use of multi stage fixed bed adiabatic reactors with inter stage cooling, or relatively small catalyst particles placed in tube and shell type reactors with a coolant fluid surrounding the catalyst filled tubes. In this regard, reference is made to U. S. Patent 4,125,553, issued November 14, 1978. The reaction zone pressure is desirably within the range of about 15 psig and about 10,000 psig, economically within the range of about 300 5,000 psig.Higher reaction zone pressures increase the total weight of product obtained per unit time and likewise improve the selectivity toward two carbon atom compounds. The ratio of hydrogen to carbon monoxide in the synthesis gas may vary widely. Normally the mole ratio of hydrogen to carbon monoxide is within the range of 20 1 to 1 20, or preferably within the range of about 5 1 to about 1 5. However, in some instances, it may be advantageous to operate with a hydrogen to carbon monoxide mole ratio as low as about 1 200. In most of the experimental work reported herein the mole ratio of the hydrogen to carbon monoxide is about 1 1. Increasing the ratio tends to increase the total rate of reaction, sometimes quite significantly, and has a smaller though favorable effect on the rate of production of two carbon atom products, but concurrently increases selectivity to methane. Increasing the hydrogen to carbon monoxide ratio also favors the formation of more highly reduced products, that is, ethanol rather than acetaldehyde or acetic acid.Carbon dioxide, which may be present in a typical case in an amount of up to about 10 mole percent in the synthesis gas, has essentially no effect. One of the features of the present invention is the recognition that a low conversion, e.g., preferably less than 20 of the CO per pass, favors the formation or production of a substantial proportion of acetic acid, ethanol, and or acetaldehyde, generally in excess of 10 . This conversiotl is conveniently achieved by employing a high space velocity correlated with other reaction variables e.g., temperature, pressure, gas composition and catalyst . Space velocities in excess of about 103 gas hourly space velocity volumes of reactant gas, at OOC and 760 mm mercury pressure, per volume of catalyst per hour, commonly referred to as GHSV are generally employed, although it is preferable that the space velocity be within the range of about 104 to about 106 per hour.Excessively hig space velocities result in uneconomically low conversions, while excessively low space velocities cause the production of more diverse spectrum o reaction products, including higher boiling hydrocarbons and oxygenated hydrocarbons. The rhodium sodium catalyst of the invention comprises rhodium provided in combination with sodium upon a support material. This is typically effected by depositing rhodium and sodium onto a particulate support material and placing the supported combination into the reaction zone. For purposes of the invention, the catalyst composition may advantageously include other elements, such as an alkali metal selected from among lithium, potassium cesium and rubidium iron, manganese and molqbdenum tungsten, the use of which in conjunction with rhodium are disclosed, respectiveLy, in copending applications Serial No. 052,841, filed on June 28, 1979 herewith, Serial No. 676,129, filed April 12, 1976, U. S.Patent 4,014,913 and U. S. Patent 4,096,164. On the basis of experience to date the amount of catalyst on the support should range from about 0.01 weight percent to about 25 weight percent, based on the combined weight of the metal catalyst nn the support material. Preferably, the amount of catalyst is within the range of about 0.1 to about 10 weight percent. The mole ratio of sodium to rhodium in the catalyst should generally vary from about 0.01 to 10, preferably from about 0.1 to 5 to effect a reduction in the methane carbon efficiency in accordance with the in vellt.on. Most preferably, the sodium rhodium mole ratio should be within the range of about 0.2 to 1. A relatively high surface area particulate support, e.g., one having a surface area upwards of about 1.0 square meters per gram BET low temperature nitrogen adsorption isotherm method is preferred, desirably upwards of about 10 square meters per gram, although surface area alone is not the sole determina tive variable. Based on research to date, silica gel is preferred as the catalyst base or support, with graphite, graphitized carbon, alpha alumina, manganese oxides, magnesia, eta alumina, gamma alumina, and active carbon being less desirable. For the purpose of this invention, it is believed that rhodium deposited on either particles of sodium oxide or a carrier containing sodium is substantially the same as rhodium and sodium codeposited on any of the above support materials. The rhodium and sodium may be deposited onto the catalyst base or support by any of the techniques commonly used for catalyst preparation, as for example, impregnation from an organic or inorganic solution, precipitation, coprecipitation, or cation exchange.Conveniently, a solution of a heat decomposable inorganic or organic rhodium compound and a sodium compound is appropriately contacted with the support material, and the support then dried and heated, the latter advantageously under reducing conditions, to form the finely dispersed sodium containing rhodium catalyst. Any of these materials may be deposited concurrently or sequentially. It suffices for the present to say that inorganic or organic compounds of rhodium and sodium are appropriately contacted with the support material, and the support then dried and heated, the latter advantageously under reducing conditions, to form the finely dispersed rhodium and sodium. The rhodium deposited is typically in metal form, desirably as fine discrete particles. The form of the sodium component is, however, not completely appreciated. It may be chemically asscciated with the rhodium or it may be in a physical admixture with the rhodium. For example, the sodium may be alloyed with the rhodium or not, in the form of a metal or an oxidized state of the metal, or it may be in the form of an oxide, a silicate, a carbonate, or the like. DESCRIPTION OF TEST REACTOR The reactor used in these studies was a 316 stainless steel, bottom agitated Magnedrive autoclave of the J. M. Berty design with a centrally positioned catalyst basket and a side product effluent line. It is of the type depicted in Figure 1 of the paper by Berty,Hambrick, Malone and Ullock, entitled Reactor ForVapor Phase Catalytic Studies , presented as Preprint 42E at the Symposium on Advances in High Pressure Technology Part II, Sixty Fourth National Meeting of theAmerican Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE , atNew Orleans, Louisiana, on March 16 20, 1969 and obtainable from AIChE at 345 East 47th. Street, New York, N. Y.10017. A variable speed, magnetically driven fan continuously recirculated the reaction mixture over the catalyst bed. The following modifications were found to facilitate operation and inhibit run away methanation reactions. 1. Hydrogen feed gas was introduced continuously at the bottom of the autoclave through the well for the shaft of the Magnedrive agitator. 2. Carbon monoxide feed gas was introduced continuously through a separate port at the bottom of the autoclave, in order to avoid a hydrogen rich zone in the autoclave. Effluent gases were removed through a port in the side of the reactor. Condensable liquid products were removed from the exit stream in a brine cooled condenser at ca. 5 to 10 C. and were collected in a holding tank under pressure. The non condensable components of the exit stream were vented through a wet test meter at atmospheric pressure to determine their total volume. A rubber septum in the atmospheric pressure line permitted syringe sampling of the noncondensable gases. No external recycle was employed. DESCRIPTION OF THE TEST PROCEDURE The bulk volume of the weighed catalyst sample was determined and the sample was placed in the catalyst basket. The quantity of catalyst charged varied from about lOcc to about 100cc. The quantity of catalyst to be charged was chosen to give an estimated reactant gas conversion of less than 10 percent.Gold plated screens and thin layers of glass wool were placed above and below the catalyst bed to prevent circulation of solid fines. The catalyst basket was charged to the reactor, and the reactor then sealed.The sealed reactor and the process lines were pressure tested at ambient temperatures to a pressure about 500 to 1000 psig in excess of the maximum anticipated working pressure. Nitrogen, hydrogen, or a mixture of the two was used for this test. When the reactor was shown to be leak free, pure hydrogen was passed through the reactor, and the temperature raised to about 240 C. The hydrogen and carbon monoxide flows were then adjusted at a mole ratio of 1 1 to give an approximate purge rate of 500 STP liters hr. This corresponds to a space velocity of from about 5000 to about 50,000 STP volumes of gas per volume of catalyst per hour depending upon the volume of catalyst charged in the particular example. The hydrogen carbon monoxide ratio was determined by gas chromatographic analysis of an effluent gas aliquot. When the appropriate gas composition was obtained, the reactor temperature was raised to the value desired. A period from about 0.5 hour to about one hour was allowed for the reactor to reach a steady state at the new temperature. The liquid product trap was then drained, a wet test meter reading was taken, and the time was noted as the beginning of a run. During the course of a run, one or more effluent gas samples were analyzed for hydrogen, carbon monoxide, acetaldehyde, methane, and other volatile hydrocarbons. At the end of a run, the liquid product was collected, and the volume of effluent gas was noted. The.liquid product was analyzed by gas chromatography. Succeeding runs with the same catalyst were made either at the same conditions or at new conditions of temperature of feed gas flow rates. If any of the conditions were changed, approximately one hour was allowed for the reactor to come to a new steady state before beginning a new run. STP means standard temperature and pressure defined as OOC. and 1 atm. pressure. PREPARATION OF CATALYSTS The catalysts cited in the examples below were all prepared by essentially the following sequence of steps The desired quantities of rhodium trichloride or rhodium III nitrate, manganese II nitrate, and sodium nitrate, depending upon the desired catalyst composition, were dissolved in distilled water at ambient temperature. The volume of distilled water taken for the preparation of this solution was chosen to just fill the void volume pores of the support sample being impregnated. DavisonTM Grade 59 silica gel 8 20 mesh U. S. Sieves was placed in a vacuum flask.The top of the flask was sealed with a rubber septum, and the flask was evacuated through the side arm. A syringe needle was then used to inject the solution onto the evacuated support. When addition was complete, the impregnated support was allowed to stand at one atmosphere for ca. 30 minutes. It was then carefully dried in a nitrogen atmosphere using the following sequence 80 C. for 1 hr. 1l00C. 2 hrs. 1500C. 2 hrs. and about 250 C. 2 hrs. . The dried, impregnated support was placed in a quartz tube through which hydrogen was continuously passed. The temperature was raised from 100C to 5000C., over a five to six hour period and then held at 5000C. for 1 hour. The reduced catalyst was cooled to ambient temperature in an atmosphere of flowing nitrogen or hydrogen. In order to remove significant amounts of impurities which were present in the support material as received from the manufacturer, the DavisonTM Grade 59 silica support was initially washed with oxalic acid prior to being used as the catalyst support. Such treatment consisted of passing a mixture of oxalic acid, glycerine, and water in proportions of 1 1.5 2.5 by weight, respectively, through a bed of support material length diameter ratio of about 20 to 25 contained within a glass tube which drained through a stopcock at its base. The contents of the tube were maintained at about 900C by means of resistance heating wire wrapped around the exterior of the tube.About 2.5 volumes of oxalic acid solution were used to wash one volume of 8 20 mesh silica gel over a three hour period. The material was then washed with about six volumes of distilled water at 900C. over a period of about four hours and then dried at 3500C for about four hours. The chemical analysis of the silica gel for iron, aluminum, sodium and calcium impurities following the above described treatment was as follows Iron as Fe203 0.01 wt. 0.004 Aluminum as A1203 0.01 wt. 0.004 Sodium as Na20 0.01 wt. 0.004 Calcium as CaO 0.02 wt. 0.01 Table I which follows summarizes the data for a series of silica gel supported rhodium catalysts containing manganese and sodium. The catalysts were tested at 3000 C., 1000 psig total pressure, and a hydrogen to carbon monoxide mole ratio of about unity, according to the aforementioned test procedure in the above described test reactor. Ethyl esters and acetates which were formed were included as ethanol and acetic acid in determining pro duct ivities and selectivities as used in the data presented herein.That is, in calculating ethanol and acetic acid values, credit was taken for quantities obtainable by hydrolyses of esters determined to be present. The examples in the table illustrate the effect of sodium addition of rhodium catalysts, namely, a significant decrease in the carbon efficiency to methane and an increase in the acetic acid selectivity among the two carbon atom oxygenated hydrocarbon products.
