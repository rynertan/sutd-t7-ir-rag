# Well tool.

## Abstract
A well tool intended to be carried in a drill string for maintaining bottom hole contact while absorbing angular and axial shock forces of a rotating drill bit has an elongated body with pipe joint ends and includes a tubular mandrel rotationally and slidably mounted within a tubular barrel. A groove preferably helical and roller connection guides the mandrel from the barrel during drilling. Resilient shock absorbing members between metal guide rings are carried between stop elements on the mandrel and barrel. Shock forces are absorbed initially by the rotating telescoping movements of the mandrel within the barrel. Excess shock forces are absorbed in the members acted on by the stop elements on further inward outward movements of the mandrel rotating in the barrel. Unique crossover rings graphite filled Teflon
