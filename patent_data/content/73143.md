## Description
Background of the Invention Angiotensin converting enzyme peptidyldipeptide hydrolase, hereinafter referred to as ACE occupies a central role in the physiology, of hypertension. The enzyme is capable of converting the decapeptide angiotensin I, having the sequence AspArgValTyrIleHisProPheHisLeu to an octapeptide, angiotensin II, by removal of the carboxy terminal HisLeu.The symbols for the foregoing chemical moieties and others used throughout this application are explained in the following table Arg arginine Asp aspartic acid Boc t butyloxycarbonyl Cbo carbobenzyloxy Glu pyro L glutamic acid Gly glycine Hip Hippuric acid Benzoyl glycine His histidine Ile isoleucine Leu leucine Phe phenylalanine Pro proline Pro 3,4 dehydroproline Ser serine Tos tosyl Trp. tryptophan Tyr tyro3ine Val valine Pht phthaloyl ACE angiotensin converting enzyme Hepes N 2 hydroxyethylpiperazine N 2 ethanesulfonic acid In each instance the symbol for any amino acid is also used herein at times to refer to a mono or di valent radical of such acid and those of ordinary skill in the art will readily understand the context of each specific use. Angiotensin I is formed by the action of the enzyme renin, an endopeptida se found in kidney, other tissues and plasma, on a serum alpha 2 globulin. Blood pressure is affected by certain pep tides found in the blood. One of these angiotensin II, is a powerful pressor blood pressure elevating agent. Another, brady kinin, a nonapeptide with the sequence ArgProProGlyPheSerProPheArg is a powerful depressor blood pressure lowering agent. In addition to a direct pressar effect, angiotensin II stimulates release of aldosterone which tends to elevate blood pressure by causing, retention of extracellular salt and fluids. Angiotensin II is found in measurable amount in the blood of normal humans However, it is found at elevated concentrations in the blood of patients with renal hypertension. The level of ACE activity is ordinarily in excess, in both normal and hypertensive humans, of the amount needed to maintain observed levels of angiotensin II. However, it ha s been found that significant blood pressure lowering is achieved in hypertensive patients by treatment with ACE inhibitors. Gavras, I. et al., New Engl. J. Med. 291, 817 1974 . ACE is a peptidyldipeptide hydrolase. It catalyzes the hydrolysis of the penultimate peptide bond at the C terminal end of a variety of acyl ated tripeptides and larger poly peptides having an unblocked alpha carboxyl group. The action of ACE results in hydrolytic cleavage of the penultimate peptide bond from the carbox yl terminal end yielding as reaction products a dipeptide and a remnant. The reactivity of the enzyme varies markedly. depending on the substrate. At least one type of pepti de bon d, having the nitrogen supplied by proline, is not hy drol yzed at all. The appa rent Micha elis constant Km varies from substrate to substrate over several orders of magnittrde . For general discussion of the kinetic parameters of enzyme catalyzed reactions, see Lehninger, A., Biochemistry, 2nd. Ed., Worth Publishers, Inc., New Yark, 1975, pp. 189 195. Many pep tides which are called inhibitors of the enzymatic conversion of. angiotansin I to angiotensin II are in fact substrates having a lower Km than angiotensin I. Such peptides are more properly termed competitive substrates. Examples of complete itive substrates include bradykinin, and the peptide BPP 5a also called SQ20475 from snake venom, whose sequence is GluLysTrpAlaPro. Numerous synthetic peptide derivatives have been shown to be ACE inhibitors by Ondetti , et al. in U.S. patent 3,832,337 issued Augst 27, 1974. The role of ACE in the pathogenesis of hypertension has prompted a search. for inhibitors of the enzyme that could act as.antihypertensive.dru.gs... See for example U.S. Patents 3,891,616, 3,947,575, 4,052,511 and 4,053,651. A highly. effective inhibitor, with high biological activity when orally administered, is 0 3 mercapto 2 methylpropanoyl L proline, designated SQ14225, or captopril disclosed in U.S. patent 4,046,889 to Ondetti et al., issued Septamber 6, 1977, and in scientific articles by Cushman, D.W. et al., Biochemistry 16, 5484 1977 , and by Ondetti, M. et al., Science 196, 441 1977 . The inhibitor SQ14225 reportedly has an I value of 2.3 x 10 8M.The I5 3 value reported by Cushman, et al. su r a is the concentration of inhibitor required to produ,ce 50 inhibition of the enzyme under a standard assay system containing substrate at a leve sub stantially above Km. It will be understood that I50 values are directly comparable when. all potential factors affecting the reaction are kept constant. The se factor s include the source of enzyme, its purity, the substrate used and its concentration , and the composition of the assay buffer. All I50 data reported herein have been parformed with the same assay system and same enzyme human urinary ACE and with the. same level of substrate and are therefore internally consistent. The mode of action of SQ14225 has b een based upon a model of the active site of ACE developed by analogy with the better known related enzyme, carboxypeptidase A. The active site was postulated to have a cationic site for binding the carb ox yl end group of the substra te and a pocket or cleft capable of binding the side chain of the C terminal amino acid and providing especially tight bind ing for the heterocyclic ring of a terminal proline residue.A similar pocket for the penultimate amino acid residue was postulated, and the published data suggested a rather stringent steric requirement, since the D form of the inhibitor was substantially more potent than its stereo isomer or the 3 methyl and unsubstituted analogs.The sulfhydryl group on the inhibitor, postulated to be bÏund at the active site near the catalytic center, was believed to play a centraL role in inactivation of the enzyme. by combining with the zinc moiety known to be essential for catalytic activity. Substituents on the sulfhydryl, such as a methyl group, and a S acetyl derivative, substantially reduced potency of the inhibitor. See Cushman, D.W., et al., Biochemistry, supra. In vitro study of the mechanism by which SQ14225 and its analogs act to inhibit ACE has b een somewhat hampered by the instability of these molacules under ambient cnditions. For example, it has been observed that a fresh aqueous solution of concentration, e.g., 1 mg per ml of SQ14225 et a pH of about 8 becomes substantially less active upon standing for as little as 30 minutes, and that activity continues to decrease as the solution stands for longer periods.It is believed that this loss in activity is mainly the result of dimerization of SQ14225 occurring at the sulfhydrylend groups, whereby a disulfide is formed which is largely inactive a s an inhibitor Since the free sulfhydryl group is highly reactive and may be readily oxidized to polar acidic moieties such as sulfone and sulfoxide groups, it may also be that the observed in vitro loss of activity of aqueous solutions of SQ14225 on standing is in some part a consequence of one or more such oxidation reactions, with formation of a sulfone or sulf oxide which does not function effectively as an inhibitor for ACE. Such reports of SQ14225 clinical testing ,as are currently available, some of which refer to the compound under th.e name Captopril or Capoten , suggest that the product is sufficiently stable in. the normal gastric and intestinal environments of most patients to be an effective inhibitor of ACE when administered orally It is not yet clear, how ever, whether there may be a group of patients for which SQ14225 is substantially ineffective.Because of the high reactivity of the free sulfhydryl group, SQ14225 could readily form mixed disulfides with serum, cellular proteins, pep tide or other free sulhydryl group containing substances in. the gastric or intestinal environments, in addition to the possibility for dimer formation or oxidative degradation reactions. A mixed disulfide with protein may be antigenic and, indeed, occaional allergic reactions have been clinically observed. See Gavras, et al., New England J. Med. 298, 991 1978 . Disulfides and oxidative degradation products of SQ14225, if formed, may at best be expected to be largely ineffective. as inhibitors.It may be postulated accordingly that dose response to SQ14225 may vary with conditions of administration and among individual patients. Moreoever, in at least some patients, unwanted side effects may occur and maintenance of an effective concentration of the inhibitor in the body may be difficult to control Adverse effects or 5014225 in man include fevers and rashes Gavras et al. surpa . Hoorntje et al. , The Lancet, i , 1212 1214 1980 describe the performance of renal biopsies on 13 patients treated with SQ14225.All biopsies showed evidence of immune complex deposition aldng the glomerular basement membranes, although 9 of 13 patients were asymptomatic at the. time of the biopsy. These authors also discussed simila rities of their findings with those induced by another drug with a free mercapto group, D penicill amine. In an effort etc devise better inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme that are more stable than captopril and less likely. to induce D penicillamine like adverse effects, applicants have prepared a series of compounds having side chain structure analogous to an effective substrate for the enzym e, be.nzoyl Phe Ala Pro and disclosed them in cop enduing U.S. application Ser. No. J87992 filed September 17, 1980. Also relevant are the class of carboxyalkyldipeptides derivatives disclosed in European publishe d application of Patchett et al. published on or about aune 25, t980. The present application defines compounds such as N L 1 carboxy 3 carbonalide propyl D,L Ala L Pro, N L 1 carboxy 3 carbo 4 iodoanilide propyl D, L Ala L Pro, and analogs i.e., amides and imides of N Iawer alkylene Ala Pro. The se two named compounds were found to be unexpectedly effective in inhibiting angio tensin converting enzyme in vitro, that is they have a very low I50, in the order of 10 9M.In contrast another closely related analog of the two hammed compounds, i.e., N L 1 carboxy 2 carbopyrrolide ethyl D,L Ala Pro, was found to have a much higher I50, in the order of 10 7M, a potency of inhibitor likely to be too low for anti hyper tensive effectiveness. It is believed, therefore, that amides and imides of N lower alkylene Ala Pro and related compounds have unpredictable effects on angiotensin converting enzyme In addition , the removal of iodine from N L 1 carboxy 3 carbo 4 iodoanilide propyl D,L Ala L Pro increases intra venous effectiveness three feld, an unexpectedly large difference in the in vivo effect of the anti hypertensive compounds of this Invention.Hence, amides and imides of N lower alkylene D,L Ala Pro and related compounds are new agents with surprising effectiveness in lowering blood pressure in vivo. Moreover, since the compounds of this invention do not have the free sulfhydryl group. of SQ14225, they are most likely to be stable and have durations of action much longer than that of SQ14225.

A variety of known methods can be employed to esterify or block any carboxyl group of a multi carboxyl amino acid or an alpha keto carboxylic acid. See, for example, Schroder E. et al, The Peptides Vol 1, Academic Press 1965 pp. 181 207, and Merrifield, R.8., Adv. Enzym. 32, 221 1969 . Furthermore, many of these precursors can be obtained commercially, eg., from Chemical Dynamics, South Plainfield, N.J. or from Bachem Chemical Co., Torrance, California. Another method for synthesizing compounds of Formuia I involves the use of a diagomethyl intermediate. See, for example, Boyer, J.H. et al Chem. Rev. 54, 1 57 1954 Aldrichimica Acta, 3 4 9 1 970 an article available fromAldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, Wisconsin Lieber, E. et al,Chem.. Rev. 65 377 384 1965 L L Abbe G. Chem. Rev.. 69. 345363 1969 .This method is especially useful for synthesizing compounds of the invention wherein A3 w C,H2 . Typically a carboxylic acid is reacted with diazomethane via a mixed anhydride reaction, e.g., EMI34.1 the product is then reacted with an acid such as HBr or HCl, in a solvent such as ethyl acetate, to form an alpha haloketone as follows EMI34.2 The o haloketone can then be reacted with an equivalent of diethylformamidomalonate, then decarboxyleted in aqueous HCl to form derivatives af 2 amino 4 keto carboxylic acid, that is compounds of the formulaEMI34.3 Compounds of this general formula can then be coupled with compounds or general formulaEMI34.4 in the presence of a reducing agent such. as sodium cyanoborohydride in aqueous solution with an organic solvent for example CH2Cl2 or CHCl3 to form compounds of the invention.Alternatively,EMI34.5 can be coupled withEMI35.1 to formEMI35.2 which in turn is coupled withEMI35.3 in the presence of, DCC or DPPA.to form a compound of this invention. The di azomethyl intermediate can be formed with virtually any carboxylated organic compound. Thus,EMI35.4 can be a difunctional or trifunctional amino acid, any dicarboxylic acid or any carboxylic acid. Appropriate protecting groups may also be necessary. The thioether compounds of this invention can be produced by several methods of synthesis. In the examples of synthesis which follow for the thioether as well as the ether and secondary amine compounds, proline will be utilized as prototype amino acid moiety. It is to be understood that this is done for illustration purposes only and. that the other ring structuresEMI35.5 can be substituted for proline in these methods unless noted otherwise.According to one preferred method the compoundEMI35.6 is reacted with P2S5 to form the compoundEMI35.7 The compoundEMI36.1 is reacted with Pro to formEMI36.2 The two products of these reactions are reacted together to yield the compounds EMI36.3 Sapon fication removes the ethyl alcohol radical and forms the corresponding salt. The free acid can be formed there .from by acidification. In this method, A Pro cannot be sub stituted for Pro. In a second preferred method, the compoundEMI36.4 is, reacted with isobutylene in the presence of sulfuric acid to form the t butyl ester ofEMI36.5 This compound is then reacted withEMI36.6 form the product EMI36.7 Next, the t butyl ester of Pro is coupled to this product using conventional coupling methods, such as the dicyclohexylcarbodiimide DCC method. Other useful coupling methods include the mixed anhydride, symmetrical anhydride, acid chloride, active ester, Woodward reagent K, or the like, methods. For a review of the coupling methods, see Methoden der Organischen Chemie Houben Weyl , Vol. XV, part IS, page 1 et seq. 1974 . The product formed, EMI37.1 ester, is deprotected, i.e., the t butyl ester groups are removed by conventional means such as treatment with trifluoroacetic acid TFA and anisole to produce the desired product. For a review of other deprotecting methods, seeMethoden der Orqanischen Chemie Houben Weyl, Vol. XV, partI, page 376 et seq. 1974 . An alternative method is the reaction ofEMI37.2 to form the desired product. This alternative method will not work for Pro although the original method will.EMI37.3 HBr in the presence of NaNO2 or with KBr in 2.5 N H2S04 in the presence of NaN02 to yield the desired product. The ether compounds of formula I can also be prepared by several other methods. According to one preferred method, the compound R1CH2C1 is reacted with the diethyl ester of malonic acid to yield R1 CH COOC2H5 2. This product is then reacted with bromine to produce R1 C Br COOC2H5 2.The compoundEMI38.1 is couplod to an ester of Pro using conventional coupling means These two products are then reacted to form the compoundEMI38.2 ester,The vorious ester groups are removed by conventional means and one carboxyl group is removed by acidf ication and heat produce the desired product. By substitutingEMI38.3 and following this procedure, the thioether compounds can be formed but this will not work with Pro. In still another method, the compoundEMI38.4 is reacted withEMI38.5 t butyl ester to produce EMI38.6 t butyl ester The ester is removed, the product reacted with Pro, and the blocking group is removed to yield a final product s according to this invention. The secondary amino compounds of this invention wherein R8 is H and X is NH can also be synthesized by the II following method. the compoundEMI39.1 is coupled with thiophenol using the, mixed anhydride method to produceEMI39.2 This product is then ,reacted withEMI39.3 to yieldEMI39.4 This compound is reacted with NaSH to formEMI39.5 Compoundsof this Invention in which R1 and R2 are bridged to form a lactone ring can be prepared using 2 hal.olactones, e.g., alpha Br gamma valerolactone and alpha Br gamma butylrolactone.The c bromo group is reactive withEMI39.6 or those analogs in which an, Nh2 or OH group is substituted for the HS group ta form compounds in which X is S, 0 or NH in the general formula for compounds of. this invention. Pro cannot be used in. this procedure unless added asEMI40.1 as a final step, i.e., after theEMI40.2 bond has been formed. The lactone ring can be opened, e.g., kith a base such as Ba CH 2 to form the corresponding gamma OH 1 carboxymethul compounds. The hydroxy group can be converted ta a salt with sodium, potassium or an organic cation such as that from arginine, or can be converted to an ethyl or methyl ester.CompoundsEMI40.3 used in any of the procedures disclosed herein may be selected from known ketocarboxylic acids, including, but not limited to, pyruvic acid, phenylpyruvic acid. 3 c,ycloh exyl 2 oxop ropionic acid, 6 methyl 2 oxoheptanoic acid, 4 methyl 2 oxopentano ic acid, 2 oxobutyric acid, 3 methyl Z axobutyric acid, 2 exoglutaric acid, 2 oxoadipic acid, Z oxo 4 phenylbutyric acid, 4 3 indolyl 2 oxobutyric acid, N acetylaminoethyl 2 oxo 4 phenylbutyrate, dimethylaminoethyl 2 oxo 4 phenylbutyrate, 2 oxo 5 methylhexanate, phenoxypyruvic acid, phenylthiopyruvic acid, 4 p chlorophenyl 2 oxobutyrate, indole 3 pyruvic acid, 2 oxo 3 p cyanophenylpropionate, 4 alpha naphthyl 2 oxobutyrate, 4 3,4 dichlorophenyl 2 oxo butyrate , or 2 oxo 4 p phenoxyphenylbutyric acid.

The compounds accordingly exist in stereoisomeric forms or in racemic mixtures thereof. All of these are within the scope of f the invention. The above described syntheses can utilize a racemate or one of the enantiomers as starting material. When the racemic starting material is used in the synthetic procedure or a racemic mixture results from the. synthesis, the stereoisomers obtained in the product can be separated by conventional chromatographic or fractional crystallization methods. In general the S isomer with respect to. the carbon bearing R1 constitutes the preferred isomeric form.Also the . S isomer of the carbon bearing R5 is preferred.

Example 31In vitro assays of the potency of selscted compounds as inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme. Compounds of this invention were assayed through the following protocol 25 microliters of buffer 0.05M Hepes buffer, pH 3.0, plus 0.1 M NaCl and 0.75 M Na2SO4 or 25 microliters. of an inhibitor in buffer was added to the bottom of a 7 ml liquid scintillation viaL. To this was added 100 microliters of buffered substrate S , 3H benzoyl Gly HisLeu, 80 oM 25 Ci mmole . The reaction was started by adding 100 microliters of partially purifie d human plasma angiotensin converting enzyme, or 100 microliters o f buffer alone.The cancentration of anzyme E used was that required to hydrolyze 8 2 of substrate when incubated at 370C for 1S.minutes, The scintillation vials and their contents were incubated at 370C for 15 minutes, and the reactions were stopped by adding 200 microliters of 0.5 M CHl to each vial. The radioactive reaction product, 3H benzoyl Gly hippuric acid , was separated from unhydrolyzed substrate by adding and mixing by inversion 3 ml of VentrexCocktail No. 1 Ventrex Laboratories, Inc., Portland, Maine , a fluid disclosed in copending U.S. patent application No.184, 653, filed September 6, 1980. Extractable 3H was.quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Substrate, in c p m , was quantified by sciatillation counting of a vial cootaining 100 l of buffered substrate in 5 ml of RIAfluor New England Nuclear . The reaction mixture containing all constituents except for inhibitor was termed the control. C . The reaction mixture lacking enzyme and inhibitor was called the blank B . Reaction mixtures containing inhibitor varied over the range of 304 10 12M were called the teat T reactions. Under the conditions of this assay, the reaction obeys first order enzyme kinetics, thus the con centration of inhibitor required to inhibit the rate of hydrolysis by half I50 approximate the Ki value. The results were estimated by use of the formula E C B x 100 x 1 5 15 min where C control c.p.m. B blank c.p.m. S substrate c.p.m. The factor 100 converts fractional substrate utilization into percentage utilization, and 1 15 minute connects to percentage substrate utilization minute. Thus, È is enzyme activity in percentage substrate utilization minute.By substituting T for C, hydrolysis rates are computed for the test reaction mixtures. By comparing a given test rate against the control rate, the degree of inhibition can, be computed Compound Product of Example No. 50 28 5.2 X 10 9 M 29 2 .3 X 10 10M 30 1.4 X 10 7,M Example 32Intravenous effactiveness of N L 1 carboxy 3 carbo 4iodoanilide propyl D,L Ala L Pro.
