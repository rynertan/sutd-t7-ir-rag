# Current source arrangement.

## Abstract
A transconductance amplifier 3 comprises a differential amplifier T₁₁, T₁₂ , whose collector load is a current mirror T₁₃, T₁₄, T₁₅, R₉, R₁₀ having a current output 8 . A current source transistor T₁₀ arranged in the common emitter line supplies a current having a positive temperature dependence. This cur rent is obtained from a current stabilising circuit 1 . By means of a voltage divider R₇, R₈ a fraction of a temperature independent voltage is applied between the control elec trodes of the differential amplifier T₁₁, T₁₂ , which voltage is taken from a voltage stabilising circuit 2 . Depending on the value of this fraction the output current on the output 8 is temperature independent or has a negative temperature dependence.
