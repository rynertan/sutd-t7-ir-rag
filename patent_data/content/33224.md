# Magnet wire.

## Abstract
A magnet wire comprises a conductor having thereon an outermost insulating wire enamel layer, either directly or over another insulating layer. The wire enamel consists essentially of a polyamideimide wherein one or both ends of at least one polyamideimide molecule is a terminal linear alkyl group hav ing at least 21 carbon atoms. The magnet wire has a high resistance to refrigerant as well as to thermal or mechanical damage and has a high lubricity.
