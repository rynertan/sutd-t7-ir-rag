## Description
This invention relates to a display system for use primarily in shops for the display of goods to be sold. Many forms of display systems currently exist, in the form of stands, shelving racks, and similar arrangements.Some of these tend to be unsatisfactory, however, in that they lac flexibility in use and are cumbersome to handle.An object of the invention is to provide a display system which is adaptable to provide various possibilities of arrangement, in use, to an extent not normally attainable by conventional systems, and which is relatively easy to handle. According to the invention, a display system comprises a column of open work form providing a plurality of suspension bars for the attachment to the column of main and or supplementary article supports, and means for supporting the column at a desired location. In one preferred arrangement, the supporting means is in the form of a base having an upwardly extending spigot for the attachment thereto of the column. Preferably, the spigot is so shaped and arranged that it may be inserted closely within the column to support the column in an upright attitude. In a composite arrangement of the system, a pair of columns may be placed in spaced relationship and interconnected by an open worli panel itself constituting a main article support to which supplementary article supports may be attached. The invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a general perspective view of one form of the display system of the invention Figure 2 is a plan view, partly in cross section, of the display system of Figure 1 incorporating a shelf Figure 3 is a perspective view of one form of composite arrangement of the display system of the invention Figure 4 is a fragmentary view showing part of the system of Figure 3 to an enlarged scale, and Figure 5 is a fragmentary view showing part of an alternative form of column of the display system of the invention. Referring to Figure 1 of the drawings, this shows a display system which includes a column of rectangular cross section, indicated generally by the numeral 1, and consisting of four longitudinal members 2 interconnected by transverse members 3 to form an open work configuration, the transverse members constituting suspension bars for the attachment to the column of article supports in the manner to be described. The column is supported on a base, indicated generally by the numeral 4. The base has an external cover, in this embodiment of generally pyramidal form, the cover being supported on an internal frame 6 which fits closely within the base and has a central pillar 7, the upper portion of which protrudes from the cover 5 in the manner of a spigot 8 and is inserted within the column 1 to maintain the latter in an upright attitude. The system includes a large variety of article supports for use in conjunction with the column 1 to support a wide variety of merchandise and ancillary items such as advertisements and lighting, for display purposes.In the example illustrated, the column is provided with a main support in the form of an arm 9 adapted to receive a series of coat hangers, one of which is illustrated at 10 supporting a garment 11. One end of the arm is provided with an attachment bracket 12, generally of channel form, the base 13 being secured to the arm 9 and one of the channel sides 14 being turned over to form a hook for attachment of the arm to the column. Also supported on the column is the display sign, indicated generally by the numeral 15 and being constituted by a right angled support 16 of channel shaped cross section containing a display sign 17, the upright part of the support being provided with a pair of spaced support brackets 12 for hanging the sign on the column 1. Figure 2 illustrates one way of mounting a shelf 17 on a column 1. A pair of T section supports 18 is secured to a respective upright member having a pair of brackets 12 spaced therealong and similar to those supporting the sign 17 in Figure 1. The supports 18 are hung on the column 1 so as to extend in mutually perpendicular directions and the shelf 17 is laid on respective flanges 18a thereof. Each support 18 is provided with a respective pin 19 projecting from its web 10 and spaced from the adjacent flange 18a by slightly less than the thickness of the shelf 17. The shelf has recessed portions 17a which are engaged beneath the pins 19 to retain the shelf in position. A composite arrangement of the system of the invention is illustrated in Figure 3. This consists of a pair of column assemblies, in this case identical to that illustrated in Figure 1, spaced apart and interconnected by an open work or mesh panel 21 which, in this embodiment, forms a main support. The panel 21 is connected to the columns by a plurality of brackets 12 similar to that used with the arm 9 in Figure 1. It will be seen that the panel 21 can be used to support a variety of supplementary article supports such as a bagsupporting arm 22, an arm 23 supporting a lamp 24, and various shelves 25. The columns themselves may also be provided with appropriate article supports, as desired. A further type of composite arrangement of the display system of the invention can be formed by suspending a column 1 horizontally between a pair of upright columns to form a type of portal frame, a part of which is illustrated in Figure 4. The vertical and horizontal columns are interconnected by brackets 25 of generally channel shaped section, one side 22 of the channel being bent over to form a hook for attachment over one of the suspension bars 3 of the column 1, the other side of the channel 25b being arranged to engage under another of the bars 3. The outwardly facing side of the channel base 25c is provided with an outwardly and upwardly extending tongue 27 behind which a bar 3 of the horizontal column 1 may be engaged for supporting the horizontal column with respect to the vertical columns.With this arrangement, both the horizontal and vertical columns may be used for the suspension of goods to be displayed. The open work construction of the columns and panels can take various alternative forms, one of which is illustrated in Figure 5. It will be seen that the suspension bars 3 are disposed obliquely with respect to the uprights 2, making generally diamond shaped formations when viewed in side elevation. The corresponding attachment brackets 12 are provided with side portions 12a inclined in a manner corresponding to the bars 3 and being provided with bent over tongues 12b for engagement over the bars 3 in the manner illustrated. The bracket shown in Figure 5 is adapted for connection to dosmwardly inclined bars 3, but it will be understood that the sides of the bracket and their corresponding tongues may be arranged for engagement over upwardly inclined bars. It will be seen that the invention provides a very convenient and adaptable display system for use in shops and other locations for the display of goods, for example.As has already been indicated, the nature of the open work columns and the types of connecting brackets may be varied as desired to permit a wide range of structures to be produced and to be used with various supporting devices.
