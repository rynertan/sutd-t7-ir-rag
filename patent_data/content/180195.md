# WIRE ELECTRODE DISCHARGE MACHINING APPARATUS

## Abstract
A wire electrode discharge machining apparatus in which there is provided at least one groove 19, 20 at the end portion of a jet nozzle 17, 18 through which a machining liquid 10 is jetted in order to obstruct the flow of the liquid 10 flowing into the gap space between the end portion of the nozzle 7, 8 and a workpiece 12 , thereby increasing the flow of the liquid flow ing along a machined slit and further improving the chip 14 exhausting performance.
