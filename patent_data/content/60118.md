# Stable photographic developing solution containing an indazole antifoggant and a lignosulfonate.

## Abstract
Lignosulfonates are incorporated in photographic de veloping solutions containing an indazole antifoggant in order to prevent or retard the precipitation of the indazole. Both black and white developing solutions, containing such developing agents as dihydroxybenzenes and or pyrazoli dones, and color developing solutions, containing primary aromatic amino color developing agents, are effectively stabilized against precipitation of indazole antifoggants by the lignosulfonates.
