## Description
FLEXIBLE ABSORBENT LAMINATES This invention relates to flexible absorbent laminates wherein a cross linked polyelectrolyte film is bonded to wicking substrates, dried, and crushed to give laminate flexibility and high water absorption rates It is known from U.S. Patent 3,669,822, Cowen,June 13, 1972, that tissue polyethylene film tissue laminates can be crimped or embossed to give an improved hand or flexibility or cloth like feel. It is also known from French Patent 2,375,985,September 1, 1978, that non woven fiber sheet tissue absorbent layer tissue polyethylene film laminates can be made flexible with adhesion to the film by adding an adhesive between the tissue and the polyethylene film followed by transverse creasing or crimping. In U.S. Patent 4,117,184, Erickson, September 26, 1978, it is disclosed that tissue aerated absorbent film tissue laminates can be prepared with improved absorption rates. While the laminates disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,117,184 have good absorption rates for water, urine, and other body fluids or exudates they have a tendency to become brittle and inflexible in atmospheres of low relative humidity. The result is an unacceptable rattling sound when the laminate is flexed and the laminate has a stiff or board like feel. It now has been found, according to the present invention, that laminates can be prepared which are both highly absorbent and flexible at both high and low relative humidities. The present invention is a flexible hydrophilic absorbent laminate that is flexible at low and high relative humidities, and characterized in that it comprises a a central, discontinuous and crushed film consisting of a cross linked, water swellable poly electrolyte that is water soluble in the salt form and b a layer of wicking substrates bonded to both sides of said film. The present invention also is directed to the laminate described above and further characterized in that the polyelectrolyte is a lightly cross linked carboxylated polyelectrolyte. While the absorbent film can be a solid film as in U.S. Patent 4,076,673, Burkholder, February 28, 1978, it is preferably an aerated film as disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,117,184. The present invention also embraces a process for making the flexible laminate described above, comprising a reducing the moisture content of a lami nate of a film, prepared from a cross linked water swellable polyelectrolyte that is water soluble in the salt form, with wicking substrates to less than 8 percent by weight by passing said laminate through a drying zone and b passing said dried laminate through a crushing zone wherein said film breaks into a plu rality of pieces which remain laminated to said sub strates. The laminates are useful to make absorbent articles such as baby diapers, or adult diapers for incontinent patients, since the laminates and or articles readily absorb aqueous solutions such as blood, urine, and other body exudates. The absorbent articles contain one or more layers of the laminate and non woven fiber mats or cellulose fluff, together with a water impermeable bottom sheet such as polyethylene and a water permeable top sheet such as non woven fiber mat. The drawing is a photographic reproduction of one species of the present invention. Figure 1 shows a view taken with a scanning electron microscope of the laminate with the top layer of paper tissue fibers partially pulled back to expose the crushed film underneath. The bottom layer of paper tissue fibers is clearly evident beneath the crushed film. Figure 2 is an enlarged view of the center portion of Figure 1, showing in greater detail the craters and bubbles in the aerated film and the bonding of the film to the fibers. The polyelectrolytes used in this invention must be water soluble in the salt form. Examples of useful polyelectrolytes include ammonium or alkali metal salts of homopolymers of acrylic or methacrylic acid and copolymers with one or more ethylenically unsaturated comonomers. Preferably the polyelectrolyte is a partially saponified polyacrylate carboxylic polymer. The polymer before saponification is the result of reacting a mixture of monomers which comprises 1 30 to 92 percent by weight of an alkyl acrylate wherein the alkyl group has from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, an alkyl methacrylate wherein the alkyl group has from 4 to 10 carbon atoms, or mixtures thereof 2 8 to 70 percent by weight of an olefinically unsaturated carboxylic acid and 3 0 to 15 percent by weight of an omega hydroxyalkyl acrylate wherein the hydroxyalkyl groups have from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Also included as a reactant is a polyfunctional or difunctional cross linking agent. By use of the term polyfunctional cross linking agent is meant a cross linking agent having three or more reactive sites available for cross linking. Example of useful alkyl acrylates include methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, propyl acrylate, butyl acrylate and hexyl acrylate. Examples of useful alkyl methacrylates include methyl methacrylate, ethyl meth acrylate, hexyl methacrylate, n octyl methacrylate and n decyl methacrylate. Examples of useful omega hydroxyalkyl acrylates include 2 hydroxyethyl acrylate, hydroxymethyl acrylate, 3 hydroxypropyl acrylate and 4 hydroxybutyl acrylate. The olefinically unsaturated carboxylic acids useful in this invention are mono or polycarboxylic acids.Examples of monocarboxylic acids include acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, crotonic acid, and isocrotonic acid.Examples of polycarboxylic acids include maleic acid, fumaric acid, and itaconic acid. The foregoing polyacrylates are then dissolved in an aqueous alkali metal hydroxide solution. The amount of hydroxide solution employed is sufficient to saponify some of the polymerized acrylate esters to alkali metal carboxylates and to neutralize the carboxylic groups of the polyacrylate to alkali metal carboxylates so that the saponified polyacrylate polymer has from 30 to 70 weight percent alkali metal carboxylates. The partially saponified polyacrylate polymer is employed as a solution containing from 5 to 60 percent by weight of the polymer. Other types of acrylic copolymers that can be employed to make the polyelectrolytes for the present invention include copolymers of acrylic esters or acrylic acids with starch or other polysaccharides, monosacchrides such as glucose, mannose or galactose, and disaccharides such as sucrose. Illustrative examples of the polyfunctional cross linking agents useful in this invention are set forth in U.S. Patents 2,926,154 3,224,986 and 3,332,901.These polyfunctional cross linking agents are generally known as polyamide polyamine epichlorohydrin adducts. The structure of these adducts has been discussed in an article by M. E. Carr et al., Journal of Applied Polymer Science, Vol. 17, pages 721 735 1973 . Illustrative examples of the difunctional cross linking agents useful in this invention are polyhaloalkanols such as 1,3 dichloroisopropanol 1,3 dibromoisopropanol sulfonium zwitterions such as the tetrahydrothiophene adduct of novolac resins haloepoxyalkanes such as epichlorohydrin, epibromohydrin, 2 methyl epichlorohydrin and epiiodohydrin polyglycidyl ethers such as 1,4 butanediol diglycidyl ether, glycerine 1,3 diglycidyl ether, ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether, propylene glycol diglycidyl ether, diethylene glycol diglycidyl ether, neopentylglycol diglycidyl ether, polypropylene glycol diglycidyl ethers having an epoxy equivalent weight range from about 175 to about 380, bisphenol A epichlorohydrin epoxy resins having an epoxy equivalent weight range from about 182 to about 975, and mixtures of the foregoing. Also useful as cross linking agents are monomeric amine epihalohydrin adducts prepared by reacting at least two moles of an epihalohydrin with one mole of various monoamines, diamines or triamines, at a temperature in the range from 00C to 900C for 0.5 to 8 hours. The reaction is carried out in a reaction media containing 10 20 weight percent polymer solids, and the remainder water, a lower alcohol such as methanol or ethanol, or aqueous solutions of the lower aliphatic alcohols, i.e., those containing 1 4 carbon atoms, can be used. The amine epihalohydrin adducts are used directly as made without separation or concentration. Sul.fonium zwitterions are known from U.S.Patents 3,660,431 3,749,737 and 3,749,738. These cross linking agents are used in an amount from about 0.05 to about 5.0 percent based on the weight of the polyelectrolyte used. This is generally sufficient to cause the polyelectrolyte to become lightly cross linked. It is sometimes desirable to add a small amount of a surfactant to the polyelectrolyte composition to aid in flowing on and removing the continuous film from the water impervious substrate. A secondary benefit of using a surfactant is to increase the wettability of the final dry absorbent film. Either anionic or nonionic surfactants may be used. Examples of the useful surfactants are the sodium alkyl sulfonates and the ethylene oxide derivatives of alkylated phenols. For the purpose of this invention, a moistureor water absorbent or water swellable polyelectrolyte is defined as one which absorbs greater than about 15 times its weight of synthetic or natural urine. Preferably the absorbency should be in the range from about 30 60 grams of urine per gram of polyelectrolyte or in the range of 90 250 grams of deionized water per gram of polyelectrolyte. The amount of cross linking agent used is a variable factor which is dependent upon the particular polyelectrolyte used and the molecular weight of the polyelectrolyte. Preferably, the amount used varies from 0.25 to 3.0 percent based on the weight of the polyelectrolyte. However, this range is varied for each polyelectrolyte in order to adjust the absorbency of the final cross linked gel. The water swellable laminates of this invention may be combined into absorbent pads with wicking or non wicking substrates Examples of wicking substrates include woven fabrics, non woven fiber mats, cellulose fluff, polymeric foams, tissue paper, crepe paper and paper toweling. The flexible laminates of this invention are made by first reducing the moisture content of the aerated laminates prepared by U.S Patent 4,117,184 in a drying zone. It is to be understood that similar flexible laminates can be made using the non aerated laminates or films of U.S Patent 4,076,673. The moisture content of the laminates must be reduced from their normal content of about 14 percent moisture to less than 8 percent and preferably in the range from 1 6 percent. If the moisture content is greater than about 8 percent, there is substantially no crushing or shattering of the film in the subsequent cracking zone since the film remains flexible. If the moisture content is less than 1 percent moisture, there is substantial tearing or rupturing of the wicking substrates, such as the fibers of the paper tissue mats. The above drying step can be accomplished with conventional drying equipment such as a steam heated drying drum, microwave heaters, infrared heaters, or similar equipment The second step of the process involves passing the dried laminate through a crushing zone wherein the film breaks into a plurality of pieces which remain substantially bonded to the substrates. This can be accomplished by passing the dried laminate together with a wire mesh screen through a pair of rollers where one of the rollers should have a yieldable or flexible surface. Suitable rollers are commercially available. They have an elastomeric surface with a Durometer A hardness from about 40 to about 100 and preferably in the range from 50 to 70.Generally these rollers are made from synthetic rubber such as neoprene, but other elastomeric materials such as polyvinyl chloride and polyurethane surfaces are acceptable provided that they have the requiredDurometer hardness. A preferred method is to use a yieldable roller coacting with a second steel roller having an engraved or etched pattern on the surface thereof. The choice of the pattern is not critical as long as it gives a patterned imprint to the laminate. It is to be noted that merely embossing the laminate does not improve its hand and or absorption. There must be a substantial amount of film breakage. There are several variables in the crushing zone which must be considered in order to obtain an acceptable product. The degree of moisture in the laminate, the degree of pressure between the rolls, and the relative hardness of the yieldable roll are all interrelated. For example, if the yieldable roll is too soft and the pressure is too great, there will be substantial amounts of tearing of the substrates. At the other extreme, with a relatively hard, yieldable roll and little pressure there will be little or no film crushing and thus little or no flexibility in the final laminates. By suitable adjustments in the foregoing variables, one can obtain a sufficient crushing of the film within the laminate without tearing or destroying the wicking substrates which are bonded to the film. The following examples illustrate the invention.Examples 1 3 Various samples of a paper aerated film paper laminate having the dimensions 3 x 12 inches 7.62 x 30.5 cm and prepared by the method set forth in Example 9 ofU.S. Patent 4,117,184 were dried on a steam heated drum roll at 2300F 2400F 1100C 115.60C for varying lengths of time. The samples each had a moisture content of 8 13 percent by weight prior to drying. Each sample was then combined with a 16 mesh stainless steel wire mesh screen and run through a pair of calendar rolls at a rate of twenty feet 6.1 m per minute with a pressure of 40 50 psig 2.82 3.52 kg cm2 . The upper roll was a 3 inch diameter by an 18 inch 7.62 x 45.7 cm long steel roll with a synthetic rubber surface 1 2 inch 1.27 cm deep and having a 78 to 80 Shore A Durometer hardness.The lower roll was a relatively smooth steel roll of 5 inches diameter by 18 inches long 12.7 x 45.7 cm . Two control runs were also conducted under the same conditions except that the samples were not subjected to heat and crushing. The samples were then compared and observed for their softness or hand at 30 40 percent relative humidity on an arbitrary scale of 1 to 10 where 1 represents the high stiffness of writing paper and the loud rattle of cellophane and 10 represents the low stiffness and the soft rustle of facial tissue paper. Any rating of 7 or more is considered satisfactory.

The results are set forth in Table II.

The laminate was unwound from the feed roll and dried on a steam heated rotating drum having a surface temperature of 220 F 2300F 104.4DC 1100C and with variable speed and take off times so as to obtain variable drying times. The laminate was immediately fed at 20 feet 6.10 m per minute to a pair of calendar rolls having a pressure of 40 50 psig 2.82 3.52 kg cm2 as in Example 1 except that the lower roll was tightly covered with a cylindrical cloth screen of 16 mesh with .023 inch 0.58 mm diameter wires. The results are set forth in TableIII. TABLE III Dried Laminate Laminate, Drum, Contact Percent Softness Example RPM Time, sec.

The above examples were tested for their absorp tion rate by the following test A sample of the laminate on a glass plate was placed under a 6 x 6 inch 15.2 cm x 15.2 cm square metal box having 0.25 inch 0.64 cm thick walls. The box was weighted with lead weights on each corner to prevent leak age. Since the capacity of film to absorb water in the laminate grams of saline solution per gram of film and the weight of the film per square foot 0.093 m2 is known, it can be calculated what the capacity of the laminate sample will be.The saline solution used is 1 percent sodium chloride in water to simulate urine. Into this box is poured 75 percent of the capacity of sample and a timer is started. When the liquid is absorbed completely as shown by lack of gloss due to free liquid, the timer is stopped. The time in seconds is the absorption rate. The test results are given in Table IV.

This laminate was dried to 4 percent moisture and crushed as set forth in Example 8 at a nip pressure of 40 50 psig 2.82 3.52 kg cm2 . The flexible crushed laminate had a softness rating of 7.Example 12 The procedure of Example 11 was repeated using a pressure of 75 psig 5.30 kg cm2 . The resulting flexible cracked laminate had an increased softness rating of 9.Example 13 The procedure of Example 9 was repeated using microwave heating and radiant infrared heating in place of the steam heated drum. The same softness rating was obtained .Example 14 An absorbent laminate containing a film weight 2 of 3 grams per square foot 32.4 g m and a tissue weight of 2.8 grams per square foot 30.2 g m2 , 1.4 grams per 2 square foot 15.1 g m on each side, was prepared as described in Examples 9 and 10 of U.S. Patent 4,117,814.The tissue was removed from one side of a large sample of the film and placed on the surface of a laboratory table. Deionized water was sprayed on the surface of the film and a fibrous, non woven fabric with a weight of 8.37 grams per square foot 90.2 g m2 was placed on the tacky surface and pressed firmly with a hand rubber roll. After conditioning for one week at 720F 22.20C and 50 percent relative humidity, a sample of the laminate was dried to 4 percent moisture content. The dry laminate was placed on a screen, 16 mesh, .023 diameter 0.58 mm wire and run between a rubber covered steel roll 78 Durometer A hardness and a steel roll at a pressure of approximately 50 psig 3.52 kg cm2 . The laminate had a softness rating of about 8 9.Control 5 Absence of drying An absorbent film tissue laminate was made by the technique described in Examples 9 and 10 of U.S. Patent 4,117,184. The weight of the laminate was approximately 6.5 grams per square foot 70.Q g m2 with an absorbent film weight of 3.7 grams per square foot 39.9 g m2 and a total tissue weight of 2.8 grams per square foot 30.2 g m2 , 1.4 grams per square foot 15.1 g m2 on each side of the film. The laminate had about 14 percent moisture by weight. The laminate was cut into 3 inch wide 7.62 cm strips about 12 inches 30.5 cm long. A strip of laminate was run between two matched, engraved steel rolls under 40 psig 2.82 kg cm2 pressure at 20 feet 6.1 m per minute. The pattern was perfectly reproduced in the laminate but the flexibility of the laminate was not increased as evidenced by visual observation. Two different, deeply engraved patterns were used with no evidence of increased flexibility in the laminate. This illustrates the fact that with a high moisture content laminate, there is no crushing of the film because the film remains flexible and does not break. Control 6 The laminate described in Control 5 is run between a rubber covered steel roll rubber hardness of about 50 60 Durometer A and a 2 inch wide 5 1 cm engraved pattern roll. Sufficient pressure was used to transfer the engraved roll pattern into the laminate.The flexibility of the laminate was not significantly increased by this action. Ten different engraved pattern rolls were tested with no significant improvement noted in flexibility. Example 15 The laminate described in Control 5 was placed on a fibrous belt that was heated from the underside by an infrared heating bar to a temperature of about 1600F l800F 71,10 C 82 .20C . The laminate was exposed to the heated belt for about 20 30 seconds to reduce the moisture content and immediately run between the rolls described inControl 6. The engraved roll pattern was transferred to the laminate and the flexibility of the laminate was significantly increased. The laminate was soft and pliable with a hand similar to paper tissue.Example 16 Five engraved roll patterns were selected and tested according to Example 15. All of the patterns produced a significant increase in the flexibility of the laminate when the laminate was preheated and dried prior to running between the rolls. Example 17 An absorbent composition was made as follows Parts by Parts by Wt. drv Wt. wet Acrylic Polymer Solution 94.4 374.6Polyoxyethylene Sorbitan 5.0 5.0 monolauratePolyamidepolyamine Epichloro 0.6 14.4 hydrin resinDeionized water to reach 20 106.0 solids Made according to Example 1 of U.S. Patent 4,076,673. A glass plate 6 x 18 inches 15.2 cm x 45.7 cm was precoated with a hard surface silicone release coating resin. The plate was preheated to 2500F 1210 C in a forced hot air oven and a 15 mil 0.38 mm wet film of the absorbent composition was cast on the hot, release coated, glass plate and placed in the hot air oven for 1 minute. The plate was removed from the oven, the film lifted from the plate, and placed in a room at 50 percent relative humidity and 720F 22.20C for 24 hours. The film was placed on a large glass plate and sprayed with a light mist of dionized water to make the surface tacky. A piece of woven cotton textile 65 x 65 count was immediately placed on the surface of the absorbent film and pressed firmly in position with a hard rubber roll. The one sided laminate was placed with the film side up and a second piece of the cotton textile was a ered to the film surface as previously described. The absorbent laminate was placed in a controlled environment at 750F 23.90C and 50 percent relative humidity for 24 hours and then dried in a 2000F 93.30C oven to a moisture content of approximately 3 percent. The laminate was placed on a wire screen, 16 mesh, .023 diameter 0.58 mm wire and run between a rubber covered steel roll Rubber hardness of 78 Durometer A and a steel roll at a pressure of approximately 40 psig 2.82 kg cm2 and roll speed of 20 ft minute 6.10 m min . The laminate flexibility was greatly increased. Originally it was stiff and boardy and after calendering, it is soft and pliable. Example 18 An absorbent film was obtained as described inExample 17. A piece of 1 8 inch thick 0.32 cm , flexible, open cell urethane foam of about 1.5 to 2.0 lb ft3 0.68 0.91 kg 0.028 m3 density was laminated to each surface of the film by the method described in Example 17. After 24 hours aging the moisture content of the laminate was reduced to about 2 3 percent by drying and the dry laminate was run between the calender rolls as described. The mechanical operation significantly increased the flexibility of the laminate from a rather stiff material to a soft flexible material.
