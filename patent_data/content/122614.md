## Description
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase is known and has been employed to catalyze the polymerization of deoxynucleoside triphosphates for the elongation of polydeoxynucleotide chains or molecules DNA . The utilization and effectiveness of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase is described by F. J. Bollum in the article entitled Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase , in the publication Another publication of interest with respect to terminal transferase terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase and its utilization for the addition of homopolymers to the 3 ends of DNA is the article by T. Nelson and D. Brutlag entitled Addition of Hompolymers to the 3 Ends of Duplex DNA with Terminal Transferase , which appeared in Of additional interest is the article by P. R. Langer, A. A. Waldrop D.C. Ward entitled Enzymatic synthesis of biotin labeled polynucleotides Novel nucleic acid affinity probes , Of special interest related to the practices of this invention is U.S. Patent 4,358,535 which issued to S. Falkow, and S. Mosley entitled Specific DNA Probes in Diagnostic Microbiology . Accordingly, the disclosures of the Falkow et al U.S. Patent 4,358,535 are also incorporated and made part of this disclosure. It is an object of this invention to provide special terminally labeled DNA molecules useful as DNA probes. It is another object of this invention to provide materials, reagents and techniques for the preparation of terminally chemically labeled DNA probes. How these and other objects of this invention are accomplished will become apparent in the light of the accompanying disclosure. The terminal chemical labeling of DNA molecules, such as DNA probes, is effected by employing terminal deoxynucleotide transferase TdT . In the terminal chemical labeling of DNA molecules, there is employed in combination with TdT, as a substrate therefor, a chemically labeled nucleotide, such as a biotinylated nucleotide, e.g. 2 deoxyuridine triphosphate 5 allyl amine biotin also identified as biotin 11 dUTP, or other biotinylated nucleotides capable of acting as a substrate for TdT for terminal attachment to the DNA. In the practice of this invention any nucleotide, preferably chemically labeled, useful as a substrate for TdT and capable of terminal attachment via TdT to the DNA being labeled is usefully employed. Although it is desirable that the nucleotides so terminally attached to the DNA comprise at least one biotinylated nucleotide, it is desirable that the nucleotides terminally attached to the DNA consist of more than 50 by number biotinylated nucleotides. However, nucleotides terminally attached to the DNA via TdT may consist of or comprise only a minor portion or percentage, in the range from about 2 to about 40 by number, biotinylated nucleotides, i.e. biotinylated deoxyribonucleotides. In accomplishment of the above, i.e. the terminal labeling of DNA probes, such as the end or terminal biotinylation of DNA probes via terminal deoxynucleotide transferase TdT, there are provided, in accordance with the practices of this invention, reagents and procedures employing the same for the In a kit provided for the practices of this invention, i.e. for the terminal labeling of DNA probes employing terminal deoxynucleotide transferase, the kit would contain the following components or reagents or tubes A preferred procedure for the preparation of the DNA for terminal labeling employing the DNase component of a kit in accordance with this invention is as follows In a plastic tube place It is important to note that if the DNA solution is dilute and contains EDTA, and is concentrated by lyophilization prior to digestion, the concentration of EDTA must be accounted for so that the MgCl₂ concentration is at least 5mM during digestion. After inactivating the DNase, the DNase treated DNA is ready for terminal labeling. After treatment of the DNA by DNase to prepare the DNA for terminal labeling, the following procedure is employed Terminal transferase tube 1 should be diluted prior to each use by adding 1.5 µl of TdT to 4.5 µl of TdT dilution buffer tube 2 . Lyophilize 8µl of 3H dTTP in a plastic tube in which the reaction will be performed. Upon removal of ethanol by lyophilization, the remaining reagents are added to 3H dTTP in the following order Incubate the reaction at 37 Using the protocol described above and the reaction as described in part C, calculate the nanomoles of nucleotides incorporated by the following equation To estimate the content of the biotinylated dUTP per ug of probe DNA, multiply the total incorporated nucleotides by 0.10 the fraction of Bio dUTP in reaction . The amount of Bio dUTP per µg of DNA should be from 1 3 nanomoles. Alternatively, DNA may be separated from unincorporated nucleotides using the spin column protocol described below As another alternative, DNA can be isolated by ethanol precipitation by the following procedure Phenol extraction of biotinylated DNA samples should be avoided because of extraction into the phenol layer or retention at the phenol water interface. In the practice of this invention it is preferred to employ as the chemically labeled nucleotide for the terminal labeling of DNA, the biotinylated nucleotide 2 dexoyuridine triphosphate 5 allylamine biotin referred to hereinabove as biotin 11 dUTP or bio dUTP. The amount of the chemically labeled nucleotide employed for the terminal labeling of the DNA is usually about 10 of the total deoxynucleotide content so employed. The percentage bio dUTP, if desired, can be increased up to 100 or decreased to about 1 to produce terminally labeled DNA probes of higher or lower specific activity, respectively. Usually, 10 bio dUTP content is suitable for most terminal labeling purposes. As indicated hereinabove, it is to be emphasized that bio dUTP may be replaced by any of the chemically labeled specially modified deoxynucleotides described or referred to hereinabove. With respect to the utilization of ³H dTTP, this component can be replaced with any other radiolabeled deoxynucleoside triphosphate or, if desired, the radiolabeled nucleoside can be completely omitted. It is pointed out also that the use of more terminal transferase per reaction results in a more rapid synthesis and, conversely, the use of less terminal transferase reduces the rate of reaction or synthesis of the terminally labeled DNA. It has been found that the concentrations of the components or constituents in the reaction have a marked effect on the resulting terminally labeled probe. For example, adding more or less deoxynucleotide, with time, the terminal tranferase will polymerize up to 90 of the added dCTP or dTTP. Accordingly, as one increases the amount of the added nucleotide longer and longer, tails are formed. Also, if the concentration of DNA to be labeled is varied, the number of moles of nucleotide incorporated changes. For example, as the amount of DNA in the reaction increases, a plateau region is reached wherein the total nucleotide incorporation is constant but absolute tail length and numbers of the incorporated chemically labeled nucleotide, e.g. bio dUTP, per molecule of DNA,decreases. Further, the concentration of metal or metal ion content, e.g. Co and or Mg , influences the terminal labeling operation and resulting terminally labeled DNA. It is mentioned hereinabove that the DNA terminally labeled with the chemically labeled or modified nucleotides can be detected by non radioactive techniques, such as by means of anti antibodies directed to the terminally linked special nucleotides or by the use of detectors, such as avidin or streptavidin, or α enzyme linked avidin or enzyme linked streptavidin, which would then attach themselves to the biotin component or moiety of the chemically labeled nucleotide. If desired, the terminally linked special nucleotides could be detected by means of radioactive techniques, such as the use of radioactive avidin, to detect or locate terminally linked biotinylated nucleotide in accordance with the practices of this invention. As mentioned hereinabove, it is preferred in the practices of this invention to employ as the terminally linked nucleotides or as substrate for the terminal transferase, biotinylated nucleotides, either biotin or iminobiotin labeled nucleotides. See the disclosures hereinabove and the nucleotides disclosed in the above identified Langer et al.publication P.N.A.S. Vol. 78, No. 11, pp. 6633 6637 1981 . Of special interest as the chemically labeled nucleotides are the glycosylated nucleotides. These special nucleotides, which are also capable of being incorporated into double stranded DNA and employed, as disclosed herein, as substrate for terminal transferase or for terminal linking to DNA, are capable, when terminally linked to DNA, of being readily detected by means of a lectin, such as Concanavalin A. The determination or detection of such glycosylated terminally linked deoxynucleotides can be carried out by employing a radioactive labeled lectin or by means of an antibody or anti antibody or by means of enzyme linked lectin in the manner mentioned hereinabove with respect to the detection or determination of biotin labeled terminally linked nucleotides. The practices of this invention, as indicated hereinabove, are applicable to the preparation of terminally labeled single stranded and double stranded DNA. Also, as indicated hereinabove, the chemically labeled terminal portion or tails of the DNA molecules or probes in accordance with this invention can be detected by a variety of techniques, such as radioactive detection techniques, enzyme based techniques and immunoassay or antibody based techniques. For example, when the chemically labeled nucleotides making up the tail portion of the DNA molecule contains a biotin moiety, the presence or location of the chemically labeled tail the biotin moiety could be detected employing a radioactive avidin or streptavidin or avidin linked to a biotinylated enzyme, such as a complex made up of avidin biotin alkaline phosphatase, or streptavidin biotin horseradish peroxidase. After attachment of the complex to the biotin moiety of the chemically labeled nucleotide, its presence, for example, would be elicited by a suitable color response or change by the action of the enzyme horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase on a suitable color generating or color changing substrate. Further, also, the presence of a chemically labeling moiety, such as biotin, in the chemically labeled nucleotide could be elicited or detected by contact with an antibody, such as goat antibody, to biotin and then by contact with a rabbit anti goat antibody, which would be a linked to an enzyme. A similar approach would be applicable to the detection of a chemically labeled nucleotide wherein the labeled nucleotide making up the tail is glycosylated or includes a glycosidic linkage. Such glycosylated nucleotides could be detected by means of, for example, radioactive lectin, e.g. radioactive Concanavalin A, or by means of other chemicals or antibodies responsive to lectin or enzymes linked to a lectin. Lectin would elicit the presence of a glycosylated nucleotide in accordance with this invention since lectin readily attaches itself to a glycosyl moiety, like avidin readily attaches itself to a biotin moiety. Enzyme based techniques applicable to the practices of this invention for the detection of the chemically labeled nucleotides are described in copending European Patent Application 84 10 0836.0. The disclosures of patent application 84 10 0836.0 are herein incorporated and made part of this disclosure. Like the DNA probes described in patent application 84 10 0836.0 the specially terminally labeled DNA or RNA molecules described herein are also capable of being fixed to a transparent substrate, such as glass, and utilized in the manner described in patent application 84 10 0836.0. Although in the practices of this invention described herein the enzyme DNase has been employed for the preparation of the DNA to be terminally labeled, other enzymes are also usefully employed. For example, restriction endonucleases can be used for the production of 3 OH termini for subsequent terminal chemical labeling with terminal transferase in accordance with this practice of this invention. Restriction endonuclease Pst 1 which produces protruding 3 OH termini and restriction endonuclease Bam HI which produces recessed 3 OH termini have been employed for this purpose. Successful labeling requires an extended incubation with an approximate 2 to 4 fold increase in the amount of terminal transferase in each reaction. Lambda exonuclease, which exposes the recessed 3 OH termini produced by most restriction endonucleases further enhances the effectiveness of these DNAs as primers for terminal transferase. Flush 3 OH termini, produced by enzymes such as Hae III, are also suitable. However, restriction enzyme digested DNA must be purified by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation prior to terminal labeling. For this reason DNase digestion is preferred. Also, randomly sheared DNA, sheared by sonication or other means, can also be terminally labeled. However, there is little or no advantage of this technique over the use of DNase to generate primer termini.
