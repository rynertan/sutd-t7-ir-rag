# Composition and process for zinc phosphate coating a metal surface and a process for painting the coated surface.

## Abstract
An acidic aqueous coating solution containing from 0.4 to 1 g l of zinc, from 5 to 40 g l of phosphate, and from 0.01 to 0.2 g l of nitrite. The solution is useful for forming on metal sur faces zinc phosphate coatings that exhibit excellent adhesion to a paint film and excellent corrosion resistance after painting when used as an undercoat for the cationic electrodeposition of a paint film.
