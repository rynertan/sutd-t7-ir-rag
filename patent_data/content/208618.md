# A MESH AND PRINTING SCREEN FOR SCREEN PRINTING AND A METHOD FOR THE PREPARATION THEREOF

## Abstract
A greatly improved printing screen used for screen print ing is provided in respect of the durability in printing, resist ance against solvents and antistatic performance based on a mesh of polyester or nylon filaments. According to the inven tion, the base mesh is subjected to exposure to low tem perature plasma of an inorganic gas prior to coating with a photosensitive resin composition in the form of an aqueous emulsion. When the plasma treated mesh is coated, prior to coating with the photosensitive resin emulsion, with a surface active agent or when the photosensitive resin emulsion is admixed with a surface active agent, further improvement can be obtained in the antistatic performance of the screen. When a base screen dyed in yellow is used, the drawbacks caused by halation in the pattern wise exposure of the screen to light can be greatly reduced.
