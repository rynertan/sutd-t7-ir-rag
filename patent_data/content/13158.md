# Electrographic stylus writing apparatus.

## Abstract
In a matrix array for the supply of an electrographic stylus writing apparatus, a plurality of styli 10, 11, 12, 13 are driven by short pulses through R C networks. The styli are divided into subgroups and parallel capacitors 22, 24 connect the styli of each subgroup to a high voltage switch 23, 25 which is responsive to a capacitor pulse driver 35 . Each stylus is also driven through a resistive line 14, 15, 16, 17 which completes the R C circuit. The resistive lines are connected in parallel for similar styli of each group to a resistor enable pulsing circuit 33 and all resistive lines are connected via isolation diodes to a resistor reset means. In operation, a short pulse from the capacitor driver circuit 35 is applied to all the capacitors 22 or 24 of a single group and an enabling pulse is applied to a predetermined single resistive line 14, 15, 16 or 17 of each group so that the combined, enabled R C circuit for a single stylus within one of the groups is activated.
