# MULTIPLE STAGE PROCESS FOR PREPARING MIXED HYDROXYALKYLCELLULOSE ETHERS

## Abstract
Mixed hydroxyalkyl cellulose ethers are prepared in a multi stage etherification process, for example, hydroxyethyl methylcellulose is prepared by reacting alkali cellulose se quentially with ethylene oxide, chloromethane, ethylene oxide and chloromethane to form a product having uniform substitu tion. Products made by this process have improved solubility and other properties.
