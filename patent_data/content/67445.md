# TURBOCHARGER CONTROL SYSTEM

## Abstract
A turbocharger control system has a waste gate 3 operative to cause engine exhaust gases to bypass the turbocharger 7 and 8 to protect the engine when the supercharging pressure Pc2 exceeds a predetermined pressure level. A pressure modulator 30 50 is provided to mix pressures derived from points 19 and 20 upstream and downstream of a compressor 8 to produce a controlling pressure Pc3 which is modulated to be of a pressure level between the compressor upstream and downstream press ures and which is also adjusted as a function of the atmospheric pressure. A waste gate actuator 40 compares the supercharging pressure Pc2 and the controlling press ure Pc3 to control the operation of the waste gate. When a motor car equipped with the system is moved to a high land where the atmospheric pressure is lower than that obtained at a low land, the controlling pressure is adjusted to be substantially the same as the controlling presure obtained on the low land, whereby the waste gate 3 is opened only at a predetermined pressure level of the supercharging press ure Pc2 to assure a good engine operability.
