# Method of heating piping arrangement and heating coil.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method of heating a piping arrangement and a heating coil used in the heating process by heating pipes through a high frequency wave induction. A spacing between the pipe outer surface and the heating coil is varied in compliance with a change in configuration of the heating coil. According to the invention, even if the coil configuration is particularly changed, it is possible to heat the pipes uniformly to obtain a uniform temperature distribu tion.
