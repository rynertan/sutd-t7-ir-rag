# Audio signal transmission system having noise reduction means.

## Abstract
An audio signal transmission system having a noise reduction circuit 6 , which includes a transmission medium 101 such as a magnetic tape to be used to transmit a digital signal converted from an input audio signal and thereafter to output the audio signal reproduced from the digital signal, a digital signal transmitter having a pulse code modulator and demodulator MODEM 9 . The noise reduction circuit 6 includes a compressor 20 for compressing the dynamic range of the input audio signal according to the detection level obtained by detecting at least the high frequency components thereof in order to supply the output from the compression to the digital signal transmitter and an expan der 21 for expanding the dynamic range of the demod ulated signal from the transmitter according to the detection level of at least the high frequency components thereof. The transmission system has a low pass filter which limits the frequency band of the input signal to be supplied to the dynamic range compressor 20 to at most half the sampling frequency of the MODEM 9 and thus permits the noise reduction circuit 6 to compress and expand signals sup plied thereto in the same frequency band without causing any erroneous operation.
