# Method for producing hydrophobic reinforcing silica fillers.

## Abstract
Hydrophobic reinforcing silica fillers for silicone rubber are produced by the steps of mixing an alkyl silicate, preferably methyl orthosilicate, at least 70 of one half of the stoichiometric amount of water required to hydrolyze the alkoxy radicals present in the alkyl silicate, an alcohol and at least 0.05 moles per mole of theoretical SiOâ‚‚ units present in the alkyl silicate of a hydrophobe agent such as hexamethyidisilazane together in the presence of a basic catalyst, said hydrophobe agent being added prior to the gelation of the mixture, and aging the mixture to obtain a composition containing a hydrophobic reinforcing silica filler for silicone rub ber. Preferably, the hydrophobe agent is added prior to or concurrently with the addition of the alkyl silicate. Vulcanized silicone rubbers possessing tensile strengths in excess of 12.4 megapascals and tear strengths of greater than 31 kiloNewtons meter can be prepared us ing the above fillers.
