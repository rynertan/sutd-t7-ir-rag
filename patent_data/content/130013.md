## Description
CRYSTALLINE GALLO SILICATES, A PROCESS FOR PRODUCING THEM AND THEIR USE AS CATALYSTS The present invention relates to novel gallosilicates and to methods of preparing the same. More particularly, this invention relates to novel crystalline gallosilicates having a mordenite type structure, to methods of preparing the same, and the use thereof as catalysts in hydrocarbon conversion reactions. Zeolites are well known natural and synthetic compositions.Many of them have been demonstrated to have catalytic properties for various types of hydrocarbon and related reactions. Zeolites can be defined as ordered porous crystalline aluminosilicates having a framework structure sufficiently open to accommodate at least water molecules. Such structures generally contain a regular array of small voids interconnected by channels or pores. The dimensions of the voids and channels can range from those of water to those of quite large molecules. For a given framework structure, the dimensions of the voids and channels are limited to a small number of values, which can vary from structure to structure. Thus these structures are capable of absorbing molecules of certain dimensions while rejecting those of dimensions larger than a critical value which varies with structure. This has led to zeolites being used as molecular sieves.Zeolites belong to a class of materials that can be termed tectoaluminosilicates which comprise in addition to zeolites felspars and felspathoids. They can be defined as having a framework structure conststing of a rigid regular three dimensional network of SiOt and A104 tetrahedra in which the tetrahedra are cross linked by larding the oxygen atoms. All oxygen atoms are shared, thus the ratio of total aluminium and silicon atoms t sxygen atoms is 1 2. The inclusion of aluminium in the framework leads to a net negative charge which is balanced by the inclusion in the crystal of an electrochemical equivalence of cautions, for example alkali metal, alkaline earth metal, hydrogen or ammonium cations or mixtures thereof.This can be expressed by a formula in which the ratio of Al to the number of the various cations such as Ca 2, Sr 2, Na, K, Li or generally M n where n is the normal oxidation state of the cation is equal to unity.Additionally in zeolites, but not in felspars and some felspathoids, the framework is sufficiently open to accommodate water molecules as well as cations. This enables these cations to be exchanged in their entirety or partially by other cations using ion exchange techniques in a conventional manner. These materials can exhibit specific affinities for specific cations and can thus be used as selective ion exchangers. By means of ion exchange, it is possible to vary the size of the pores in a given crystalline zeolite material, modifying its molecular sieve properties. Also by means of ion exchange the catalytic properties of these materials can be altered.In addition to the framework and charge compensating cations, zeolites can contain other materials such as water and organic molecules, hydrated salts and oxides of eg Na, Al and Si introduced during synthesis, or formed or added during subsequent treatments. Zeolites are best characterised according to framework structure type, ie the topology of the framework, irrespective of composition, distribution of different tetrahedral atoms, cell dimensions and symmetry.A code consisting of three capital letters has been adoptedsfor each known structure type following the recommendations by IUPAC on zeolite nomenclature ChemicalNomenclature, and Formulation of Compositions, of Synthetic andNatural Zeolites, IUPAC yellow booklet, 1978 and a compilation of 38 known zeolite structure types has been published by The StructureCommission of the International Zeolite Association Atlas ofZeolite Structure Types, by Meier, W.M. and Olsen, D.H. 1978 , distributed by Polycrystal Book Service, Pittsburgh, Pa, USA .In addition to the groups classified by known structure type, there is a further group of crystalline zeolite materials whose X ray diffraction patterns, sorption, ion exchange and related properties indicate that they do not have known structure types but appear to have new, as yet undetermined structure types. An example of such a material is the novel porous crystalline aluminosilicate designatedTheta l and described in our published copending European patent specification No 0057049. Our copending European application published under No. 14023 describes a process for preparing crystalline aluminosilicates of the mordenite type, by crystallising from a mixture containing a source of silica, a source of alumina, a source of alkali metal and a nitrogenous organic base which is for instance a neopentylamine. Zeolites and other tectoaluminosilicates belong to a larger class of materials that can be termed tectometallosilicates which can be defined in the same way as tectoaluminosilicates except that the aluminium is replaced by a range of elements, which includes, it is claimed, Ti, Zr, V, Cr, Mo, Mn, Fe, Co, Rh, Ni, Zn, B, Al, Ga,Ge, Sn, As and Sb, but in some cases the claimed materials have not been well characterised. In some cases where the element has the same formal oxidation state as Si ie 4 the resultant framework is electro neutral and the resultant materials resemble crystalline silicas. In other cases there is a resultant framework negative charge which must be compensated by cations as in tectoaluminosilicates. In some cases the materials have porous frameworks like those of zeolites or porous crystalline silicas which they therefore resemble. A number of crystalline gallosilicates useful in catalytic applications have been previously disclosed. For example, gallosilicates having the following structure types see Atlas ofZeolite Structures above have been disclosed FAU USP 3431219 ,ANA UK Patent Application GB 2102779A and MFI UK PatentApplication GB 2053960A . It has now been found that a novel crystalline gallosilicate, having a mordenite MOR type structure but with different acidity properties to the analogous MOR type aluminosilicates, can be produceS by crystallisation from a mixture containing a source of gallia, a source of silica, a source of alkali metal s , water and a template such as an organic nitrogen containing base. Accordingly, the present invention provides novel crystalline gallosilicates having the following composition in terms of the mole ratios of the oxides 0.9 O.25M2 nO Ga203 xSi02 yH20 zQ wherein M is at least one cation having a valence n, x is at least 3, y x is from 0 to 5, Q is a template used in the synthesis of the gallosilicate and z is 0 20, and wherein the gallosilicate in the calcined hydrogen form has an X ray diffraction pattern substantially as set forth in Table A of this specification. By the term calcined hydrogen form is meant here and throughout this specification that the gallosilicate has been calcined to render it substantially free of the template introduced during synthesis or subsequent treatments, and the cation M is hydrogen. The hydrogen form of the gallosilicate may also be produced by known methods such as exchange with hydrogen ions or with ammonium cations followed by one or more calcinations or a combination of the two followed by one or more calcination stages, if the gallosilicate still contained ammonium ions. By template is meant throughout this specification a chemical agent which encourages crystallisation to proceed towards a particular framework structure or structures. The H20 content y of the gallosilicate will depend, within the ratios set out above, upon the conditions under which it is dried, calcined, subjected to further aqueous treatments or combinations thereof after synthesis. The content z of template Q in the gallosilicate will also depend upon the conditions under which it is washed, calcined or subjected to further aqueous treatments or combinations thereof after synthesis, and also on the synthesis parameters of the gallosilicate, particularly the proportion of Q present in the original hydrogel. The template content is usually highest for the parent gallosilicate. Complete removal of the template is usually only posglble by degradation of the template using a process involving thermal or oxidative reactions or both. By the parent gallosilicate is meant throughout this specification the gallosilicate as synthesised and washed, with an optional drying step as hereinafter described. The cation M in the gallosilicate may be selected from H , ammonium, alkali metal cations, alkaline earth metal cations, template containing cations, aluminium cations, gallium cation and mixtures thereof. The cations present in the gallosilicate may be replaced using conventional ion exchange techniques either wholly or partially by other cations e.g. hydrogen ions or metal cations. The gallosilicates according to the present invention have in their calcined hydrogen form an X ray diffraction pattern shown inTable A below. The specific values in the Tables were determined using copper K alpha radiation and a computer step scan. The peak heights, I, and their position as a function of 2 theta, where theta is the Bragg angle, were read from the spectrometer output. From this output the relative intensities 100 x I Io, where 1o is the intensity of the strongest peak, and d the interplanar spacing in A, corresponding to the recorded peaks were calculated. It will be understood by those skilled in the art that theX ray diffraction pattern of gallosilicates may vary in the values of I Io and the d spacing depending for example upon whether the sample being examined is calcined or uncalcined, upon the temperature of calcination, upon the nature of the cation present in the gallosilicate, the mole ratio of silica to gallia, and the particle size of the gallosilicate. The gallosilicate is suitably produced from an initial mixture containing a source of silica, a source of gallia, a source of alkali metal s , water and a template such as an organic nitrogen containing base. The silica to gallia mole ratio in the initial mixture is at least 3 1. The silica to gallia mole ratio is suitably from 4 1 to 25 1 preferably in the range 8 1 to 20 1. The free alkali metal s hydroxide to water mole ratio, defined as Number of moles of total alkali metal s Number of moles of alkali metal s required to convert gallia present to alkali metal gallate s , ie MGa0 j Number of moles of water present is greater than 1x1O5 1, suitably from 1x10 3 1 to 2x10 2 1, preferably in the range 2x10 3 1 to 8x10 3 1. Similarly the mole ratio of silica to free alkali metal s hydroxide may suitably be greater than 1, preferably from 2 1 to 500 1, most preferably from 5 1 to 100 1. The mole ratio of water to silica may suitably be less than 500 1, preferably from 6 1 to 30 1, even more preferably from 9 1 to 30 1. In preparing the gel, sources of silica which may be used include for instance sodium silicate, silica hydrosol, silica gel, silica sol and silicic acid. It is preferable to use an aqueous colloidal dispersion of silica particles, eg the Ludox RegisteredTrade Mark varieties manufactured by DuPont. The sources of gallia used may include for instance inorganic gallium salts such as the oxides, hydroxides and gallates. The source of gallium is preferably gallium hydroxide activated by the addition of aqueous alkali hydroxides and a nitrogen base to the appropriate proportion of freshly precipitated gallium hydroxide, and then the source of silica is slowly added to the activated gallium hydroxide. The alkali metal s used in the initial mixture may similarly be the inorganic salts containing these metals, their oxides and their hydroxides. Sodium is the preferred alkali metal. The template is suitably selected from one or more of the following a an alkene diamine or a dialkenetriamine or a polyalkylene polyamine which may be ethylene diamine, propylene diamine, butylene diamine, pentylene diamine, diethylene triamine, triethylene tetraamine, tetraethylene pentamine or pentaethylene hexamine, or the like, b an alkanolamine which may be mono , di or tri alkanol amine and in which the alkanol group is derived from ethanol, propanol or butanol, c ammonia, and d an alkylene glycol, a C1 C6 polyol or a polyoxyalkylene glycol in which the alkylene groups may be ethylene, propylene or butylene. Of these, the templates referred to in b above are most preferred. The gallosilicate is suitably prepared by forming a mixture of all the reactants, by simply mixing them together while maintaining the mixture suitably at a temperature from 0 to 100 C, preferably from 20 and 600C, until a homogeneous gel is formed and cry stalli sing the gel so formed at a temperature above 70 C, preferably from 100 to 2200C for a period of at least 2 hours, preferably for 6 to 240 hours. The optimum crystallisation period can vary and may depend upon such factors as the temperature, agitation, pH, gel composition and seeding. The mixing and digestion of the ingredients is suitably carried out under autogenous pressure although the pressure can be further increased by pressurisation with a suitable gas, eg nitrogen. It is preferable to agitate the mixture during the crystallisation stages. It is preferable that the silica source is added to the other reagents in such a manner as to commence gelation at a relatively high pH within the range specified above. The product obtained in this manner contains cations which may be hydrogen, alkali metal s , gallium, or template cations or any combination thereof. The cations in the product may be converted to hydrogen to give rise to the hydrogen form of the product. This may be achieved by techniques known to those skilled in the art, e.g. a ammonia exchange followed by calcination, b acid exchange or a combination of a and b . The product or the hydrogen form thereof may also be loaded with additional metals or oxides suitable for imparting a specific type of catalytic activity. The loading may be achieved by conventiMnal ion exchange or impregnation techniques. The metal compounds which may be used for ion exchange and or impregnation may be compounds of any one of the following metals or groups of metals, namely those belonging to Groups IB, IIB, IIIA, IVA, VA, VIB, VIIB and VIII according to the Periodic Table due to Mendeleef.Specifically, compounds of copper,silver, zinc, aluminium, gallium, indium, thallium, lead, antimony, bismuth, chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, iridium, platinum, rhenium, thorium and the rare earth metals are preferred. The gallosilicate products of the present invention may be admixed or bound with other catalytic components or supports such as e.g. other zeolites or gallosilicates before or after impregnation or after exchange with one of the aforementioned metal compounds to produce an attrition resistant catalyst. The conventional alumina or silica binders may also be used. The gallosilicates of the present invention may be used, whether or not impregnated and or ion exchanged, admixed, supported or bound as catalysts for any of the following reactions alkylation, dealkylation, dehydrocyclodimerisation, aromatisation, transalkylation, isomerisation, dehydrogenation, hydrogenation, cracking, hydrocracking, cyclisation, oligomerisation, polymerisation, and dehydration reactions, particularly dehydration of alcohols and ethers. The gallosilicate catalysts may also be used for conversion of carbon monoxide hydrogen mixtures to hydrocarbons. The gallosilicates may be used in the form of fixed, fluidised or moving beds. The present invention is further illustrated with reference to the following Examples.
