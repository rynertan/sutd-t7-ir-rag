# Dye transfer type thermal printing sheets and method for printing.

## Abstract
The dye transfer type thermal printing sheet and method for printing of this invention are a printing sheet comprising a transfer sheet in which a smooth heat resistant layer composed of fine particles, a liquid lubricating material and a polymer is formed on one side of a substrate, and on the other side is formed a coloring material layer containing at least one sublimable dye, non sublimable particles and a binder, a part of said non sublimable particles jutting out from the reference surface of the sublimable dye layer and an image receiving sheet having, on a substrate for image receiving sheet, a development layer composed of, at least, inorganic fine particles, a binder having dye affinity and another binder immiscible with said binder and a dye transfer type thermal method for printing which comprises placing the aforesaid coloring material layer and develop ment layer of the above mentioned printing sheet face to face with each other, heating the printing sheet selectively from the smooth heat resistant layer side of the transfer sheet, and thereby forming an image on the image receiving sheet. By the above mentioned sheet and method, there can be given stable running of transfer sheet and a printed image which is reduced in dropout and noise, has a good depth of color and a good quality of image, and is excellent in storage stability. Further, a full color image also can be obtained by using three kinds of transfer sheets which develop a cyan color, a magenta color or a yellow color, respectively.
