# FOAMABLE POLYETHERIMIDE RESIN FORMULATION

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a foamable polyether imide resin. These foamable polyetherimides have an effec tive amount of a chemical blowing agent which decomposes at a temperature equal to or greater than the glass transition temperature of the polyetherimide resin and does not have an adverse effect on the polyetherimide.
