# Large pore alumina supported transition metal alkyl.

## Abstract
In a process for polymerizing 1 olefin with a catalyst system comprising a reaction product of a porous alumina and an organometallic compound of the formula RCH₂ ₄M wherein M is Ti, Zr, or Hf and R is a group which is such that there is no hydrogen atom attached to an atom which is in the β position to M, and more specifically, R is aryl, aralkyl, tertiary alkyl, for example, trialkylmethyl, or trialkylsilyl, the improvement characterized in that the alumina has an average pore diameter of at least about 150 A and or at least about 10 of the total pore volume of the alumina is provided by pores having diameters greater than about 200 A.
