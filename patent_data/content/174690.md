## Description
This invention relates to a clearance sensing slack adjuster built into a railvehicle brake unit, including a non rotatable,axially movable, tubular piston rod for introducing a force in a brakingdirection and being attached to a piston in afixed housing of the unit a non rotatable, threaded spindle arranged coaxiallyinside the piston rod to deliver a brake force from the adjuster an adjuster nut, which is in non self locking engagement with the spindle in thebraking direction abuts a bearing in the piston rod and isclutchable over a main clutch to the piston rod for transmitting brake force abarrel spring, which is stronger than a return spring for the piston and acts inthe braking direction between the piston rod and the spindle and a non rotatablelocking sleeve, which is axially movable in the braking direction only adistance corresponding to a set control distance under the action of a lockingspring, supported by the piston rod, and isclutchable to the adjuster nut over a control clutch,the following members with increasing diameters being arranged coaxially outside each other the barrel spring, the spindle, the piston rod and the locking sleeve with its locking spring. It is well known in the art that different requirements are put on railvehicle slack adjusters. Generally speaking, these requirements are the sameirrespective of whether the slack adjuster is of the so called axial type usedas a self contained cylinder shaped member with slack adjusting function in arail vehicle brake rigging or is combined with a brake cylinder to a brake unitfor use at a wheel or disc to be braked. However, as the slack adjuster with which the present invention isconcerned is primarily designed for use in a brake unit, the requirements onbrake unit adjusters are of most interest in this case. The invention is,however, also applicable to axial type adjusters, and no limitation to a brakeunit adjuster is intended. The present invention is concerned with a so called one nut adjuster,i.e. the design and function is entirely based on the use of one nut inengagement with a spindle. There is presently a tendency towards morefrequent use of this type of adjuster, as such a design can be made simpler,cheaper, and more compact than a two nut design. Numerous examples ofthis general type are known in the art. Other requirements on an adjuster of this type is that it shall have ahigh mechanical efficiency and high accuracy as regards the obtained slackunder differing working conditions. Further the design shall be sturdy andeasy to protect against the influence from the harsh environment. It shall when need arises be easily serviceable. Last but not least the design shall be easy to adopt to different sizes and working lengths with a minimumnumber of differing parts. These and other requirements are fulfilled by a slack adjuster of thetype referred to at the outset, if according to the inventiona spring washer is arranged between the bearing and the piston rod behind thebearing in the braking direction so as to assist the engagement of the main clutch. In this design the arrangement is such that when during a brakingoperation the set control distance has been consumed, the control clutch isopened unloaded from the force of the locking spring leaving the adjusternut free to rotate on the spindle against the bearing provided that the mainclutch is not closed under the influence of a counter force in the spindle. The design principle behind the design according to the invention is thatthe control clutch is unloaded from the force of the barrel spring or in otherwords that there is a separate locking sleeve with its locking spring. Thisprinciple is earlier suggested in a quite different and much more complicateddesign shown in FR A 1 461 497 or in a later version US A 3 610 376. The closestprior art, however, is represented by FR A 2 296 793. In most cases it is preferred to have a single acting slack adjusterreducing any excessive slack. In this instance the control clutch is formeddirectly with the adjuster nut. It is, however, also possible to obtain a double acting slack adjuster. Inthis instance the adjuster nut extends forward in the braking direction pastthe bearing and is there provided with a flange for cooperation therewithwith a certain play. Further, a clutch ring is arranged between on one handthe bearing and on the other hand the adjuster nut and the locking sleeve, thecontrol clutch being formed between the locking sleeve and the clutch ring,which in parallel therewith forms a nut clutch with the adjuster nut. The invention will be described in further detail below reference beingmade to the accompanying drawing, in which Fig. 1 is a side view, mostly in section, of a rail vehicle brake unit with a slackadjuster embodying the invention and Fig. 2 is asection corresponding to a part of Fig. 1 andshowing a modified embodiment in which theslack adjuster is made double acting instead ofsingle acting. In Fig. 1 is shown a rail vehicle brake unitincorporating a single acting slack adjuster of theclearance sensing type according to the invention.As is well known in the art a unit of this kindis to be mounted in the vicinity of a wheel or discto be braked, and it may equally well be used fortread braking as for disc braking. A housing 1 shown in simplified form is provided with attachments 2 for its mounting to asuitable part of the vehicle. A piston 3 with asealing 4 is axially movable in the housing 1under the influence of brake fluid, in the showncase air under pressure, admitted through an inlet5. A return spring 6 is arranged between thehousing 1 and the piston 3. A tubular piston rod 7 is attached to the piston 3and extends forwards or to the left in the drawingin the housing 1, it thus being understood that theterms forwards and backwards as usedthroughout this specification have the meaning to the left and to the right in the drawing,respectively. Inside the piston rod is a likewisetubular spindle 8, provided with an externalthread over most of its length. At its forward endthe spindle 8 is provided with a tool grip 9 for thepurpose of allowing manual rotation of the spindleas will be described below, Towards its forward end the spindle 8 is providedwith clutch teeth for forming a clutch 10with corresponding teeth on an ear 11 insertedinto the spindle. The clutch 10 is normally heldengaged by a helical compression spring 12between the spindle and a spring ring 13 held onthe ear 11 by the flange of a screw 14 in the end ofthe ear 1. In spite of the fact that the ear 11 in themounted condition of the brake unit is nonrotatablymounted to a part of a brake rigging notshown , it will be possible to manually rotate thespindle 8 by the provision of the spring loadedclutch 10. For the purpose of preventing moisture, dustand dirt from entering the slack adjustermechanism a flexible bellows 15 is attached onone hand to the housing 1 and on the other handto a cap 16 on the spindle 8 just inside the toolgrip 9. Coaxially outside of the piston rod 7 and integraltherewith is a piston rod sleeve 17 with aninternal axial ball bearing 18 backed by a springwasher 19. The connection between the pistonrod 7 and its sleeve 17 is broken at circumferentiallyspaced locations for allowing axialmovements of a fingered locking sleeve 20. This locking sleeve 20 is biased forward by alocking spring 21 of the helical compression typeacting on a flange 20 of the sleeve 20 andsupported by an edge to be described on thepiston rod 7. The forward movement of thelocking sleeve 20 is, however, limited by a controldistance sleeve 22 threaded into the housing 1and together with the sleeve flange 20 defining acontrol distance A, which easily can be adjustedby rotating the control distance sleeve 22. The housing 1 is provided with an internalguide ring 23 in spline type engagement withexternal guide ridges 24 on the piston rod 7,which thus will only move axially in the housing1. The spindle 8 in turn is guided by the piston rod7 as well as the piston rod sleeve 17. There is alocking ring 25 on the spindle 8 in front of thepiston rod sleeve 17. By the provision of anunthreaded spindle part to the right in the drawing,the spindle 8 is prevented from unintentionally leaving its engagement with the nut 26 andthus from leaving the unit. In non self tacking engagement with the spindle8 is an internally threaded adjuster nut 26abutting the bearing 17. The adjuster nut isprovided with two clutch teeth rings for cooperationwith corresponding clutch teeth at the end ofthe piston rod 7 and the locking sleeve 20,respectively, for forming a main clutch 27 and acontrol clutch 28, respectively. A barrel spring 29 of the helical compressiontype acts between the piston 3 and the spindle 8.The spring 29 is arranged between respective endflanges of two mounting sleeves 30 and 31, whichare only axially movable relative to each other bya pin and groove arrangement. The initial mountingis made possible by the provision of a bayonettype joint, which is indicated at the forward end ofthe inner sleeve 30. The provision of the subassemblyconsisting of the barrel spring with itstwo mounting sleeves greatly facilitates the finalmounting of the unit. The inner sleeve 30 abuts the piston 3 with itsend flange having a ridge in cooperation with acorresponding groove in the piston 3. The oppositeend of the other sleeve 31 has a socketshaped as and passed over the hexagonal screw14. In this way it is possible before the mountingof the unit to adjust the length of the unit orin other words the position of the spindle 8relative to the nut 26 by turning the ear 11 andthereby the whole sub assembly consisting of thefollowing main component the ear 11, the spindle8, the sleeves 30 and 31, and the barrel spring29, which acts on the spindle over a locking ring32. Based on the assumption that the slack isexcessive, or in other words that the slackbetween a wheel or disc to be braked by the brakeunit with its brake rigging and the brake block orbrake pad is greater than what corresponds to theset control distance A, the function of thedescribed unit is as follows At the admission of pressurized brake fluidthrough the inlet 5 the piston 3 with its piston rod7 will be pushed forward to the left in thedrawing . Concurrently therewith the lockingsleeve 20, the adjuster nut 26 the control clutch28 being closed by the spring 21 , the spindle 8,and the ear 11 will also move forward under theforce from the spring 21 as well as from thebarrel spring 29, always applying its force on thespindle 8 . When the locking sleeve flange 20 hitsthe control distance sleeve 22, the control clutch28 opens leaving the adjuster nut 26 free to rotateon the spindle 8. The application stroke can now continue underthe force from the barrel spring 29 pushing thespindle 8 with the ear 11 forward, until theapplication stroke is finished in that the brakeblock or pad hits the wheel or disc to be braked.During this fast application stroke consuming theexcessive slack the adjuster nut 26 rotates on thespindle 8 against the bearing 18. At the continued axial movement forward of the piston 3 with the piston rod 7 the main clutch 27will soon be closed assisted by the spring washer19 preventing any further rotation of the nut 26.After consumption of the thread play between theadjuster nut 26 and the spindle 8, the elasticity inthe brake unit and the brake rigging with which itis connected will be taken up, whereupon thebrake force corresponding to the brake fluidpressure on the piston 3 will be transmitted viathe piston rod 7, the adjuster nut 26, the spindle 8,and the ear 11. At the subsequent lowering of the fluidpressure against the piston 3 a brake releasemovement under the action of the return spring 6will commence. At the beginning of the returnstroke the adjuster nut 26 is held against rotationby the main clutch 27 being closed, whereascontrol clutch 28 is open due to the fact thatduring the elasticity and braking parts of theapplication stroke the piston rod 7, the nut 26 andthe spindle 8 has moved forward as a unit acertain distance, whereas the locking sleeve 20has stopped because of its engagement with thecontrol distance sleeve 22 . This condition prevails until the counter forcefrom the brake block or pad lowers or in otherwords the block or pad is just about to leave thewheel or disc, so that the main clutch 27 opens. Ifas usual a certain excessive slack has developedduring the braking, the control clutch 28 willremain open, so that the adjuster nut 26 is free torotate aided by the spring 19 until a slackcorresponding to the control distance A has beenrestored and the control clutch 28 is closed. At the end of the release stroke the differentparts of the brake unit assume the positionsshown in the drawing. It appears that the slack adjuster of the unitshown in Fig. 1 is single acting, consuming anexcessive slack in one brake operation. It alsoappears that the adjuster is of the clearance sensingtype. If as is most normal theexcessive slack develops during the braking operationas a result of wear, the slack adjustmentoccurs during the release stroke. In a brake operation with correct slack norotation of the adjuster nut 26 will occur neitherduring the application stroke nor the releasestroke. Manual adjustment in either direction forexample after the replacement of a worn outbrake block or pad can be performed by turningthe spindle 8 over the tool grip 9 overcoming theclutch 10 normally held engaged by the force ofthe spring 12. In some cases it may be preferred to have adouble acting adjuster in the unit i.e. an adjusterremoving not only a slack which is too large butalso one which is too small. Based on the single actingdesign shown in Fig. 1 only relativelyminor modifications are necessary for arriving ata double acting version, as appears from Fig. 2,where members common with the Fig. 1 versionhave the same numerals with the addition of theletter A. Thus the following members differing only slightly from those of Fig. 1 may be foundin the Fig. 2 version a piston rod 7A with a pistonroad sleeve 17A, a spindle 8A with a tool grip 9A,a clutch 10A, an ear 11A, a bearing 18A, a springwasher 19A, a locking sleeve 20A, a locking ring25A, an adjuster nut 26A, and a main clutch 27Abetween the piston rod 7A and the nut 26A. In this case a separate clutch ring 33A isarranged on the bearing 18A. This ring havingtwo sets of clutch teeth forms a control clutch 28Awith the locking sleeve 20A and a nut clutch 34Awith the adjuster nut 26A. If the slack is too small adjustment occursduring the application stroke, when the controlclutch 28A is closed and the main clutch 27A isopen, allowing the nut 26A to move out ofengagement with the nut clutch 34A and rotate onits forward flange, until the flange 20 hits thecontrol distance sleeve 22 Fig. 1 . It is to be noted that in spite of its compactdesign and comparatively limited length thebrake unit due to the inventive slack adjuster has a very long working stroke. Also, only fewchanges are necessary in order to adopt the unitto different working forces and strokes. Anotheradvantage to be noted is that a mechanicalparking brake, which is necessary in many cases,may easily be arranged without any encroachmentin the described mechanism any parkingbrake mechanism can be attached to the cap 16,thus acting in the brake application direction onthe tool grip 9 of the spindle 8. Modifications are possible within the scope ofthe appending claims. Especially it should benoted that the disclosed slack adjuster design,although being specified as of the pushing typebuilt into a brake unit, can equally well be modifiedto an axial rod type adjuster of pushing or more common of pulling type, as is well knownto any person skilled in the art.
