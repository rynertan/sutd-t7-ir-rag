# Process for preparing pourable solid shortening.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of discrete pieces of pourable solid shortening wherein molten fat at a temperature at which no visible solids are present is super cooled and is rapidly crystallized in droplets. By rapidly crystalliz ing the melted fat a uniform, firm network of crystals is formed. It has been found that rapid crystallizing, as opposed to crystal seeding or initial partial crystallization, yields fat particles having improved resistance to agglomeration. The resulting shortening composition is softer at ambient temperature for easy cleanup of cooking surfaces and utensils after use while maintaining improved resistance to agglomeration.

## Description
PROCESS FOR PREPARINGPOURABLE SOLID SHORTENING Technical Field This invention relates to a process for preparation of discrete pieces of pourable solid shortening wherein molten fat is rapidly crystallized in droplets on a chilled surface. Background of the Invention Practically all pourable solid frying fats which have been produced previously in powdered, flaked or particle form have a tendency, particularly after storage at room temperature for a short time or during shipment in warm climates, to become sticky and to form lumps which are not easily broken apart. The powdered particles or flakes agglomerate to form larger lumps or a solid mass. This tendency is increased by exposure to high storage temperatures, and can result in the melting of particulate fats suitable for cooking. Refrigerated storaye can be employed to help prevent agglomeration and melting but is costly and not always practical.These problems of agg lomeration upon storage have been countered primarily by three means 1 encapsulation or enrobing, 2 use of high melting fat materials, often in combination with flow conditioning agents, and 3 tempering processes. Shortening compositions with high melting point ranges having a solid fat content high enough to retain particle integrity at high storage temperatures are believed to impart a waxy or greasy taste to food cooked therein. A solid coating is formed on the food as it cools to below the high melting point range of a substantial percentage of the fats in the shortening. For this reason shortening compositions with lower melting point ranges, particularly those available in liquid or solid block form, have been extensively used for cooking. A composition which has both a high melting point range to prevent agglomeration on storage and a low melting point range at food eating temperatures to prevent a yreasy taste perception on food cooked therein is ciisclosed by U.S.Patent 4,469,710 of Rielley, Krause s Fishter. This patent describes a pourable solid shortening wherein the solids content index is a minimum of 15 at 1100F to aid in avoiaing agglomeration on storage and a maximum of 78 at 920F to aid in preventing a greasy taste on food cooked therein.However, use of a product having high solids can result in problems in cleaning cooking surfaces and utensils. A solid coating of the fat forms on the cooking surfaces and utensils upon cooling after use. A product which retains its resistance to agglomeration at elevated temperatures while minimizing a waxy taste impression on foods cooked therein, but which is softer or has less solids content at lower temperatures, would be easier to clean from cooking surfaces and utensils after use. The process employed in making the Rielley et al product comprises a hydrogenating or hardening and optionally deodorizing the starting material fats, b heating the fats to a temperature above the clear melting point of the fat mixture with stirring to obtain an homogeneous molten fat composition, c rapidly chilling the homogeneous molten fat composition to crystallize sufficiently for further processing, d extruding the crystallized fat composition into rods which are cut into small segments or pieces, and e optionally tempering the fat segments at about 850F to about 950F for up to 6 days. U.S. Patent 4,343,826 of McNaught discloses a process for preparing beads of fat that are uniform in size similar to the process used in making chocolate chips. A fat is melted at a temperature below about 80do, cooled to about 1.50C to 4.5cm below the clear melting point of the fat, allowed to form an amount of solids sufficient to permit the fat to hold its shape when formed into drops, formed into drops, and cooled and collected. McNaught employs equipment similar to that used in making chocolate chips. An example suitable for use is a chocolate depositer wherein the depositer contains a dropping head which is a series of nozzles through which the fat is forced by means of pistons. The fat forms drops at the end of the nozzles and the drops fall onto a belt as truncated cone shaped beads. The beads are directed by the belt to a cooling chamber in order to promote further crystallization.Unlike the Rielley et al product, the McNaught composition requires refrigeration at 400F 500F 40C 100C to avoid agglomeration. The processes of Rielley et al. and McNaught are complicated and require meticulous control of fat viscosity.In McNaught s process if the fat is too fluid it can flow through the nozzles too fast and collect in puddles on the conveyor. If the fat is too viscous it solidifies in and clogs the nozzles. Likewise, in Rielley et al. s process if the fat is too soft when extruded it cannot be properly cut into pieces and will not retain its shape. Thus, these processes are not suitable for preparation of a softer product which provides the performance benefit of easy cleanup after use while having improved resistance to agglomeration. It is also known in the art to prepare fat particles by means of spray drying, spray chilling, flaking rolls, or chilling rolls. These processes have several disadvantages in that several complicated steps and expensive pieces of equipment are required. Spray drying or chilling is niore suitable for preparing small fat particles having diameters measured in microns and not larger particles. Chilling and flaking rolls have the disadvantage of creating flakes having generally flat surfaces. These flakes have a high particle to particle contact area which contributes to agglonieration. Thus, an efficient process is needed for producing discrete pieces of fat which are storage stable at elevated temperatures and yet suitable for cooking with easy cleanup properties. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an efficient process for the preparation of discrete pieces of fat. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a process for the preparation of discrete pieces of pourable solid shortening having improved resistance to agglonieration. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a process for the preparation of discrete pieces of pourable solid shortening which is easy to clean from cooking surfaces and utensils after use. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a process for the preparation of discrete pieces of pourable solid shortening by means of rapid crystallization on a chilled surface, in a chilled mold, or in an immiscible liquid. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a pourable solid shortening composition having improved resistance to agglomeration at elevated temperatures, but which is suitable for use in cooking and easy to clean up after use. These and other objects will become apparent from the following description and examples. All percents are by weight unless otherwise specified. Summary of the Invention This invention relates to a process for the preparation of discrete pieces of pourable solid shortening wherein molten fat which is above its melting point is supercooled and is rapidly crystallized in droplets, and the product formed thereby. By rapidly crystallizing the melted fat a uniform, firm network of crystals is formed. It has been found that rapid crystallizing, as opposed to crystal seeding or initial partial crystallization, yields fat particles having improved resistance to agglomeration. The resulting shortening composition is softer at ambient temperature for easy cleanup of cooking surfaces and utensils after use without decreasing its agglomeration resistance.Description of Preferred Embodiments The present invention is a process for the preparation of discrete pieces of pourable solid fats having improved resistance to agglomeration and improved cleanup performance comprising a rapidly crystallizing melted fat from a temperature at which no visible solids are present by depositing the fat onto a chilled surface, chilled mold, or immiscible liquid and b collecting the crystallized fat pieces.The present invention further comprises the pourable solid shortening prepared by this process. As used herein, the term particle denotes discrete pieces of pourable solid fats. The term solids content index as used herein denotes the percent by weight of solids in a sample of fat at a given temperature as determined by pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance, hereinafter described. Starting materials suitable for use in the process of the present invention comprise edible fats and oils and mixtures thereof. Any of a variety of glyceride based fat materials can be used in the present invention provided that the solids content is such as to be suitable for use in cooking foods.The starting fats should have been refined, bleached and may optionally be deodorized to remove off flavors. Refining, bleaching and deodorizing are well known processes and will not be described herein. Specific reference to such treatments can be found in D. Swern, Ed., Bailey s IndustrialOil and Fat Products, 3rd ed., Interscience Publishers, 1964. The term fat used herein shall refer to edible fats and oils comprising triglycerides, fatty acids, fatty alcohols, and esters of such acids and alcohols. Especially appropriate for use in the present invention are triglycerides of straight chain or branched chain, saturated or unsaturated, monocarboxylic acids having from 10 to 28 carbon atoms.Suitable sources of such fats are 1 vegetable fats and oils such as soybean, olive, corn, safflower, sunflower, cottonseed, canola, rapeseed, sesame seed, nasturtium seed, tiger seed, ricebran, wallflower, and mustard seed 2 meat fats such as tallow or lard 3 marine oils such as menhaden, pilcherd, sardine, whale or herring 4 nut fats and oils such as coconut, palm, palm kernel, babassu kernel, or peanut 5 milkfat, butterfat 6 cocoa butter ana cocoa butter substitutes such as shea, or illipe butter and 7 synthetic fats. The preferred starting materials are edible polymorphic vegetable fats, and mixtures thereof, comprising triglycerides having saturated or unsaturated acyl groups predominately in the range of from 12 to 24 carbon atoms such as lauroyl, lauroleoyl, myristoyl, myristoleoyl, palmitoyl, palmitoleoyl, stearoyl, oleoyl, linoleoyl, arachidoyl, arachidonoyl, behenoyl, erucoyl, and the like. Branched chain saturated or unsaturated acyl groups are also useful herein. In particular, the preferred starting fat comprises a blend of beta tending vegetable oils. A stabilizer can be employed herein to protect against oxidative deterioration at high temperatures, such as increases in viscosity and fatty acid content, formation of polymerized fatty matter, increase in refractive index, destruction of tocopherols, and intensification of foaming tendencies due to the formation of oxidized and polymerized constitutents. Silicone oils, particularly methyl and ethyl silicones, are useful for this purpose. Suitable viscosities of the silicones are in the range of from about 50 to about 1,000,000, preferably from about 100 to about 1000 centistokes at 25to. In the present invention it is appropriate to employ the silicone at a level of 0 to 10 parts per million ppm by weight, and 1 to 5 ppm by weight is preferred.Appropriate means must be used to assure substantially uniform dispersion of the small amount of silicone throughout the shortening composition. The silicone is added to the starting material after completion of the refining, bleaching and optional deodorizing processes. Various other additives can be used herein provided that they are edible and aesthetically desirable and do not have a detrimental effect upon the melting and crystallization characteristics of the shortening. The types of additives employed should be consistent with the ultimate end use of the shortening, which primarily comprises various frying or griddling, in particular, deep fat frying. The process of the present invention is used to prepare fats which can normally contain minor amounts of optional flavorings, emulsifiers, anti spattering agents, anti sticking agents, or the like. Fats have been categorized in accordance with the overall tendency of their triglyceride solids to crystallize in a specific polymorphic phase as alpha tending, beta tending, and beta prime tending. As used herein, the term betatending denotes a triglyceride hardstock which has a propensity for crystallizing in the beta polymorphic phase rather than in either the alpha or beta prime phases. The term non beta tending is used herein to denote triglyceride hardstocks with a propensity for crystallizing in either the alpha or beta prime polymorphic phases. Triglyceride hardstocks known as beta tending include fats and oils such as lard, sunflowerseed oil, linseed oil, hazelnut oil, soybean oil, peanut oil, olive oil, corn oil, and other fats containing acyl groups of at least 8 carbon atoms.Non beta tending hardstocks include fats such as cottonseed oil, palm oil, tallow, whale and other fish oils, and other fats containing a substantial portion of acyl groups having 20 to 24 carbon atoms. Both beta tending and non beta tending fats can be used as starting materials for the present invention. However, beta tending fats are preferred due to the higher melting point of the beta crystals formed in the solid shortening.The result is a product with a greater amount of solids at high temperatures which provides improved storage stability.Non beta tending materials require hardening to achieve a higher level of solids in the starting material. With non beta tending materials a higher level of solids, and the corresponding thermodynamic stability, cannot be achieved through tempering. This preference for the beta phase is in contrast to currently available solid shortenings which are formulated to contain a major amount of the beta prime phase to provide a softer texture suitable for spooning or dipping in handling. Compositions with less than about 1056 beta phase crystals present can be capable of resisting agglomeration at 1100F and yet not impart a greasy or waxy taste to food cooked therein. It is believed this can be achieved due to the combination of starting material selection and processing.The solids content of fat varies with the fat chain length and with the degree of saturation. The selection of fats containing a high solids content, or hardening of the selected fat, will enable it to resist agglomeration at high storage temperatures without the presence of a large amount of beta phase crystals. A starting material fat containing sufficiently high solids content may be obtained by either 1 hydrogenating, or by 2 blending of fats of different iodine values. Hydrogenation can be carried out by conventional methods and usually consists of a batch process wherein the fat composition is contacted with hydrogen in the presence of a nickel catalyst.The solids content index of a fat also can be increased by adoring to it a small amount of the corresponding fat with a low iodine value. The iodine value of a fat indicates the number of grams of iodine equivalent to the halogen absorbed by a 100 gram sample. In general, the lower the iodine value of a given fat the greater will be its solids content at a given temperature and the more saturated it will be. The iodine value can readily be determined by known methods. Although starting materials generated by either method are suitable for use in the present invention, blending of fats of different iodine values is preferred. Blending of starting materials of different iodine values allows greater flexibility in control of the melting profile. The starting material fats for use in the process of the present invention must be completely melted. This can be achieved by heating the fats, preferably with mixing to a temperature well above the clear melting point of the fats to assure dissolution of all fat crystal nuclei. Tile heating vessel can be blanketed with an inert gas such as nitrogen to eliminate the oxidation of the fat. Excessive heating should be avoided as it is uneconomical and also could result in degradation of the fat composition. The process of the present invention comprises rapidly crystallizing fat by depositing drops of the fat onto a chilled surface, chilled mold, or immiscible liquid. The surface, mold, or liquid is kept as cold as possible, and has a maximum temperature dependent upon the melting point of the fat composition. Suitable liquids which can be employed include water, glycol, alcohol, or mixtures of liquids immiscible with fat. Preferably a chilled surface is employed at a temperature of from about 200F 70C to about 700F 210C and comprises a conveyor belt cooled by appropriate means, such as by inert gas, air, cold water, or other suitable coolants, having a temperature as cold as possible, preferably at from about OOF 180C to about 700F 210C . The term rapid crystallization as used herein denotes immediate crystallization from the molten state, at which no solids are visible, without use of agitation or working. The fat is at a feed temperature at which no visible solids are present. Typically, this is about 300F 1CC to about 2000F 930C . The maximum feed temperature is that at which the fat drop is distorted in shape prior to its crystallization on the chilled surface or mold. Preferably, the fat is supercooled to below this distortion temperature range by suitable equipment in a precooling step. The term supercooling as used herein denotes that the fat is cooled below the melting point but is substantially free of visible solids. The supercooling can be achieved by pumping the fat through a scraped wall heat exchanger, a plate and frame heat exchanger, other equivalent equipment, or a combination thereof. The fat is then fed into equipment, hereinafter denoted as a dropformer, suitable for depositing droplets of the fat onto a conveyor, chilled surface or mold, or immiscible liquid. Preferred for use herein is a type of unit wherein the fat is pumped into a cylinder having multiple orifices for dropping the melted fat therefrom. An example of suitable equipment for use herein is disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,279,579 of Froeschke, issued July 21, 1981. Any conditions that delay rapid crystallization have an adverse effect upon the product generated. For example, an increase in hold time prior to deposit which allows partial crystallization to occur in the fat is undesirable. A lower hold temperature prior to rapid crystallization of the fat is also detrimental. Any conditions which allow the initial formation of crystals from the high melting point fats prior to solidification adversely affect the product generated by increasing agg lomeration and or increasing any tempering time required for the fat particles to reach a stable polymorphic state. This is apparently due to fractionation of the high and low melting solids.If the high melting point fats are precrystallized, the low melting fractions comprise the substantial portion of the crystal lattices formed upon deposit on the chilled surface, chilled mold, or immiscible liquid. This increases product agglomeration. If sufficient precrystallization of high melting point fractions occurs, particles cannot be formed because the fat is too soft. Rapid and immediate crystallization from the molten fat avoids this and generates fat particles having improved resistance to agglomeration. Continuous chilling of the crystallized fat, such as by means of a cooling tunnel along a conveyor, is desired but not necessary to further solidify the fat as rapidly as possible The final step of the process of the present invention comprises collecting the crystallized fat pieces from the chilled surface, chilled mold, or immiscible liquid.This can be achieved by any suitable means, such as by use of a scraper bar or doctor blade to remove the fat particles from the conveyor belt directly onto a packaging line, inverting the mold to permit the fat to be removed, use of a screening device to remove the fat from the liquid, or allowing the fat to float to the top of the liquid and removing it by means of n scraper bar. The shape of the resulting fat particles can vary depending upon the dropformer employed. Suitable shapes include large particles, pellets, spears, hemispheres, ellipsoids, cubes, cylinders, half cylinders, and the like.The geometric form of the particles is preferably that of a hemisphere like shape. The hemisphere like particles preferably have a diameter of from about 3 mm to about 25 mm and a height of from about 1 mm to about 10 mm. The pieces may be either substantially uniform in size and shape or irregular in size and shape. Preferably the particles are substantially uniform in size and shape to minimize contact and thereby minimize agglomeration. Optionally, the fat particles are tempered by maintaining them at a temperature of about 850F 290C to about 950F 350C for a period of 0 to about 144 hours. This permits transformation of the fat crystals to the higher melting thermodynamically stable beta polymorphic phase. The speed of crystal transformation is temperature dependent, with the speed becoming faster in proportion as the temperature becomes higher. The preferred tempering conditions are at a temperature of 880F 31 C to 920F 330C for a minimum of 72 hours. The fat particles have a minimum solids co ntentindex about 10 at 1100F 430C and a maximum solids content index of about 78 at 920F 330C . A solids content index of less than 14 at 1100F 430C is preferred. This constitutes an improvement in resistance to agglomeration. Previously known compositions required a higher solids content to resist agglomeration at 1100F 430C . The maximum solids content index of 78 at 920F 330C is necessary to obtain acceptable organoleptic quality for foods cooked therein. The fat particles of the present invention provide the additional performance benefit of easy cleanup after use.Because the fat is softer, or has a lower solids content index at ambient temperature, it is easier to wash from cooking surfaces and utensils. The softer fat also aids in producing better eating quality for foods cooked therein because it helps eliminate waxiness. This results without impairment uf the resistance to agglomeration of the fat at elevated temperatures and is due to the specific selection of starting materials and processing conditions. The process described herein provides softer fat particles having stronger crystal lattices.TESTING METHODS A. Solids Content Index Method The solid contents index represents the percent by weight of solids in the sample of fat at a given temperature as determined by pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance. The measurements were all determined using the general method described in Madison and Kill, J. Am. Oil Chem. Soc., 55, 328 331 1978 , hereinafter denoted PNMR, using a PraxisPulsed NMR SFC 900 Solid Fat Analyzer. Specifically, the solids content indices were measured using the following sample preparation procedure. Fat samples were melted and added to PNkF tubes. They were melted at 1400F 600C and held for 30 minutes.The samples were then shaken and tempered at 800F 270C for 5 minutes, 320F 0 C for 5 minutes, 800F 270C for 30 minutes, and 320F OOC for 5 minutes. Thsamples were tempered at 900F 50F for 0, 1, 3 or 6 days and then stored at 400F 4 C to prevent any further crystal phase transformations.To determine solids content indices the samples were then placed into baths of increasing temperatures, i.e., 500F looC , 700F 210C , 800F 270C , 920F 330C , 1050F 410C , 1100F 430C , and 1200F 49to . After allowing 20 minutes for equilibration at each temperature, the solids content index reading was measured in the instrument. B. Agglomeration Test Methods 1. Vial Agg lomeration Method The level of agglomeration was determined by assigning grading numbers of 1 to 15 to each sample, wherein 1 represented no agglomeration and the higher numbers corresponded to increasing levels of agglomeration. The fat samples were removed to ovens maintained at 1100F 20F 430C 10C .After a storage period of 48 hours at this temperature, the vials were removed and allowed to equilibrate at room temperature overnight. The samples were then agitated and graded by visual inspection. Agglomeration grades up to level 6 were considered acceptable because agglomeration was minimal and the product easily flowed from the container with shaking or tappiny. Grades 1 through 4 were preferred.Grades 5 and 6 were considered marginally acceptable.Grades 7 to 15 represented unacceptable levels of agglom eration. At grades 7 and 8 an agglomerated mass of product formed and hard blows to the container were required to cause the product to break into large clumps of pellets. At higher grades the product was agglomerated sufficiently to prevent any flowability and began melting. The following grading scale was employed 1. Product poured out easily, no agglomeration. 2. Slight shaking of container required to initiate flow.3. Hard shaking of container required to initiate flow.4. Light blows tapping of container on hard surface required.5. Hard blows of container on hard surface required.6. Hard blows required to break pellets apart into groups of 2 or 3 pieces.7. Hard blows to container required to break pellets apart into groups of 4 or more.8. Repeated hard blows required to break away a few pellets. 9. No pieces or lumps broke away from mass. Pellets have slight disfigurement. 10. Pellets melted together and disfigured, but distinguishable as pellets.11. Product approximately 20 melted, 80 disfigured. 12. Product approximately 50 melted, 50 disfigured.13. Product approximately 70 melted, 308 disfigured.14. Product approximately 90 melted, 108 disfigured.15. Product 100 melted into a liquid. 2. Case Agglomeration Method A second agglomeration test method, hereinafter denoted as case agglomeration test, was employed to test product packaged in 15 or 20 pound bags with two such bags packed into a carton or box. The cartons containing product were stored at 1100F 430C for at least 48 hours followed by storage at 700F 210C for at least 24 hours. The pourable shortening particles were removed from the packaging and poured through a screen having one inch 2.54 cm square openings. A grading number of 1 to 4 was assigned to each sample based upon the size and number of agglomerated clumps of fat pieces which did not pass through the screen.Grade 4 had no agglomeration and was preferred. Grade 3 was considered acceptable. Grade 2 was marginally acceptable and Grade 1 represented unacceptable levels of agglomeration.The following grading scale was employed 4. Preferred All product passed through screen and was not sticky. 3. Acceptable Four or less 2 to 3 inch clumps or one 4 inch clump remained on screen but were easily broken to pass through the screen. Alternatively, a 1 foot drop of the product caused all of it to pass through the screen or only a few 2 to 3 inch clumps remained on the screen. 2. Marginally acceptable After a 1 foot drop of the product, two or more 4 to 6 inch clumps that were easily broken apart, or sticky product with three or more 2 to 3 inch clumps that were not easily broken apart. 1. Unacceptable After a 1 foot drop of the product, one or more 7 inch clumps, or sticky product with four or more 2 to 4 inch clumps not easily broken apart. C. Beta Crystal Measurement The perccntage of beta phase crystals present in the shortening compositions was determined by X ray diffraction using the following method. Samples were prepared by slicing three fat segments, either untempered or previously tempered at 900F 50F 31cm 3cm , and fastening them into a 15 mm. by 20 mm. window of a 38 mm. by 38 mm. aluminum sample holder backed with transparent tape. Minimal pressure and friction was applied in sample placement to avoid heating the samples which could cause phase changes. APhillips XkG 3100 X ray Diffraction Spectrophotometer was employed to measure the presence of beta and beta prime crystal phases. The following examples illustrate the present invention without intending to be limiting thereof. All percentages are by weight unless otherwise stated. Example 1 Example 1 demonstrates that the process of the present invention provides fat particles having improved agglomeration compared to the Rielley et al process and to processes using a precrystallizing step. A blend of refined, bleached, and deodorized soybean oils having an iodine value of 57 was heated to 1400F 600C to assure no crystal nuclei were present. It was then pumped through a scraped wall heat exchanger where it was supercooled to 1200F 450C , and contained no visible solids.The cooled fat was then deposited onto a cold metal plate having molds hemispherical in shape to form solid shortening particles designated as A 1. The temperature of the plate was 400F 40C . A portion of the stream of the above fat which was heated and pumped through a scraped wall heat exchanger was then pumped into a crystallizer tank and held at 1200F 490C under agitation. The fat was then deposited onto a cold metal plate held at a temperature of 4ocF 40C in the same manner to form particles designated as A 2 and A 3 after being held in the crystallization tank for 2 and 4 hours, respectively. The same fat was used to prepare pourable solid shortening designated as A 4, as described in U.S. Patent 4,469,710 of Rielley et al., said method herein incorporated by reference. The fat pieces were tested for agglomeration at 11 00F 43CC and percent beta crystal phase and were then tempered at 930F 34cm , The fats were then tested periodically for agglomeration at 1100F 430C and percent beta crystal phase. The resulting data is summarized inTable 1. Fats A 2 and A 3 prepared using the crystallizer tank, and Fat A 4 prepared using and the method of theRielley et al. patent, had increased tempering tint and increased aggjomeration compared to Fat A 1 prepared using the process of the present invention with rio hold tine for crystal formation prior to depositing.

The process of Example 1 was employed to prepare solid shortening particles of the same formula as Example 1 composition A 1 through A 4 except that the fat was held under agitation in the crystallizer tank at temperatures of 1050F 410C , 1100F 430C and 1200F 490C for only the time period required to cool to the respective temperatures.Visible solids formed in the feed oil for the fat at 1050F 410C and 1100F 430C . The particles were formed, tempered and analyzed for beta crystals and agglomeration as in Example 1. The resulting data is summarized in Table III.The fat particles prepared using the lower temperatures had increased tempering time and increased agglomeration compared to the fat held at 1200F 490C and Fat A 1 of Example 1 prepared using no hold time.

A soybean oil blend having the formula of Example 1 composition A l through A 4 was heated to 1400F 600C to assure no crystal nuclei were present. It was then cooled to 1 200F 49 C . The cooled fat was then pumped through a dropformer as described in U.S. Patent 4,279,579 ofFroeschke, issued July 21, 1981, available from SandvikProcess Systems, Inc. of Fellbach, West Germany. This unit deposited the fat in drops from a cylinder having multiple orifices onto a chilled conveyor belt. The feed temperature of the fat was 1200F 490C and its discharge temperature was about 610F 160C . The conveyor belt was cooled by chilled water at a temperature of about 660F 190C and the belt speed was about 6 meters per minute.The fat deposits were cooled for about 1 minutes, during which time crystallization occurred. The crystallized fat pieces, denoted herein as A 5, were removed from the conveyor belt by means of a doctor blade. Portions of the fat were tempered at 930F 340C and again analyzed for these attributes. Three other process runs were conducted using the above equipment except that for run A 6 the feed temperature was 125CF 52GC for run A 7 the feed temperature was 1400F 600C and for run A 8 the feed temperature was 110F 430C and the fat was held in a precrystallizer tank at 1100F 430C for about 2 hours, prior to depositing on the cooled belt. Portions of the fat samples were tempered at 930F 340C . The product in run A 8 did not crystallize well and was soft and mushy. Runs A S, A 6 and A 7 resulted in acceptable product. Samples from all runs were analyzed tor percent beta crystal phase and agglomeration. The data are summarized in Table IV.The percent beta for the tempered product was measured after 8 days of tempering at 930F 340C . The data demonstrate that precrystallization of the feed oil yields unacceptable product and that a high level of beta crystals is not necessary to have product resistant to agglomeration.

Pourable solid shortening was prepared as in Example 3 from two formulas. Fat D was prepared from a blend of soybean oils having an iodine value of about 70. Fat E was prepared from a blend of 65 soybean oil and 35 of refined bleached cottonseed oil having an iodine value of about 70.Fat A 9 was prepared from the blend of soybean oils used inExample I accordiny to the process of Rielley et al. Fat F was bought commercially and was a solid block plastic shortening, which was spoonable and had a solids content index of 1 at 1100F 430C and an iodine value of about 69.The fats were analyzed for agglomeration and subjected to cleanup perforriance evaluation. Each fat sample was melted in a 1500F 660C water bath. A syringe was used to transfer 3 cc of each fat onto an aluminum tray. A 250 ml beaker was placed on top of the fat to aid in spreading it evenly. The trays were placed in a constant temperature room at 700F 210C for at least 3 hours. Ten panelists were given a bowl of 1150F 460cm R. solution of 0.15 Joy in water. Joy is a commercially available liquid soap for washing dishes by hand. The panelists cleaned the fats from the tray using paper towels which had been immersed in the Joy solution. Fat F was used as a reference and the ease of cleaning the fats from the tray compared to fat F using the following scales.If the panelist rated a fat more difficult to clean than fat F a grade was assigned as follows 9 Extreme difference 8 ltiuch difference 7 Moderate difference 6 Slight difference 5 ko differenceIf a panelist rated a fat as easier to clean than fat L a grade was assigned as follows 5 No difference 4 Slight difference 3 Moderate difference 2 Much difference 1 Extreme differenceThe resulting data were analyzed statistically and are summarized in Table V.

Example 5 Example 5 demonstrates improved agglomeration and cleanup performance of fat prepared by the claimed process when compared to that prepared by the process of Rielley et al. A pourable solid shortening G was prepared from a blend of soybean oils having an iodine value of about 71, using the process of Example 3. A shortening similar to Example I, A 10, was prepared using the method of Rielley et al. The shortenings were analyzed using the methods described previously for solids content index, cleanup performance, and agglomeration using the case agglomeration method. The resulting data are summarized in Table VI and demonstrate improved agglomeration and cleanup performance for the shortening of the present invention.
