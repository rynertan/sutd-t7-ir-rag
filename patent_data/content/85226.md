# SWITCHING NETWORK FOR USE IN A TIME DIVISION MULTIPLEX SYSTEM

## Abstract
A non blocking switching network for use in a TDM time division multiplex system for switching digital signals carried on incoming buses to outgoing buses e.g. in a telephone switching office is disclosed. Each outgoing bus has associated therewith storage devices capable of storing, at least temporarily, all the data received from all the incoming buses. Appropriate control equipment controls which of the incoming channels, stored in the respective storage devices, is applied to the respective outgoing bus. In short, each outgoing bus has associated with itself, dedi cated storage devices from which data is applied only to that respective outgoing bus. By this technique, every outgoing bus has access to all the channels on all the incoming buses.
