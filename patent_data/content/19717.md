## Description
CONCENTRATING ALKALI METAL iH DROXIDE IN HYBRID CELLSBackground of the Invention The present invention relates to the concentration of alkali metal hydroxide solutions, having for its object the provision of an electrochemical process for such a purpose that is especially applicable to the treatment of cell liquor from a chloralkali cell to separate the sodium ions from the cell liquor and concentrate them in another liquor as a sodium hydroxide solution. The production of chlorine and crude caustic sodium hydroxide solutions by electrolysis of brine is a major industry. Two types of electrolysis cells are primari 5 used in the production of chlorine and caustic. They are the diaphragm cell and the mercury cell. Membrane cells are also used to a minor but growing extent.Considerable quantities of energy are required for electrolysis of the brine to produce chlorine and subsequent treatment of the cell liquor resulting from electrolysis in diaphragm cells is necessary to obtain caustic solution of the desired purity and concentration. A 50 weight percent aqueous caustic solution of low sodium chloride content is a commercially desired product. Knows processes for electrolysis of brine in diaphragm, mercury and membrane cells produce cathode cell liquors having a caustic content ranging from about 10 to 12 percent by weight in the case of daphrae m cel s to as high as about 40 percent by afeight in the case of membrane cells, and as much as 50 percent by weight in the case of mercury cells. The liquor produced in diaphragm ccli may contain up to 15 percent by weight of odin chloridc, but this is virtually absent in the liquor of membrane cells and essentially absent in the liquor of mercury cells.Although they produce the most desirably concentrated and pire caustic liquor, mercury cells have envirojunental problems and are no longer the technology of choice in industrialized countries. In the diaphragm cell, brine is continuously fed to an anode corinartment, where chlorine is produced, and then flows through a diaphragm, usually made of asbestos, to a cathode compartment. Hydrogen gas is discharged from the solution at the cathode, with attendant generation of hydroxyl ions. To minimize back migration of hydroxyl ions from the cathode compartment to the anode compartment, a positive flow rate is always maintained that is a flow in excess of the conversion rate. As a consequence, the resulting catholyte solution, i.e., the cathode cell liquor as the term is used herein, contains unconsumed sodium chloride in addition to product sodium hydroxide.The cathode cell liquor containing, typically, only 10 to 12 percent of sodium hydroxide and about 15 percent of sodium chloride must be purified and concentrated to obtain a saleable caustic solution. A membrane cell, which employs a membrane selectivel permeable to certain cations in place of a diaphragm, yields a catholyte of low salt content and having a caustic content of up to about 40 percent by weight. The highly corrosive chlorine medium, however, is harsh on membrane materials. Accordingly, specifications for the membrane must be rigid and the membranes useful in. the presence of chlorine are quite expensive. In addition, voltage drop within the membrane cell is relatively high which increases consumption of electricity. In sum, membrane cells are costly in regard to investment and operating costs. Typical processes for concentrating cell liquor and separating the sodium chloride from the caustic involve evaporation and crystallization with the consumption of large mnounts of stearn and consequently, fuel required to generate steam. Investment in such processes is considerable. One solution to the problem of obtaining cell liquor having high caustic concentration is described in U.S.Patent No. 3,899,403 to Cook, Jr., et al. A threecompartment electrolytic cell produces solutions of high and low caustic concentration. A two compartment cell then concentrates the solution of low caustic concentration.Current efficiency in the two compartment cell is lower than that in the three compartment cell. U.S. Patent No. 4,036,717 to Babinsk et al describes a three chamber electrolyti cell for concentrating and purifying cell liquor containing sodium or potassium hydroxide. The Babinsky cell has a porous catalytic anode, a porous asbestos diaphragm between the anode chamber and a central chamber, and a cation permselective membrane between the central chamber and the cathode chamber. Cell liquor is passed through the central chamber and cozlcentrated caustic is withdrawn from the cathode chamber. Hydrogen gas generated by the eletrolysis is supplied to the anode to decrease tne potential across the cell below the evolution potential for chlorine and coincidentally reduce the power requirements for the cell. The use of hydrogen air fuel cells to consume hydrogen gas from chloralkali cells and to produce electricity for powering a portion of the chloralkali cells Is described in Canadian Patent No. 642,449. In the process described, hydrogen formed by the electrolysis of brine in a chloralkali cell is fed to the anode of a fuel celi and air is fed to the cathode. The fuel cell employs an aqueous elect yte of sodium or potassium hydroxide naving a coneentration of 5 to 50 weight percent. There is no suggestion in the patent that the cell liquor from the chloralkali cells can be purifified or concentrated by using such cell liquor as the electrolyte in the fuel cell. U.S. Patent No. 3,511,712 to Giner describes a process for removing carbon dioxide from gas streams using a fuii cell. An alkali metal carbonate solution formed by absorption of carbon dioxide is introduced to the anode compartment of a fuel cell operating by consumption of an oxidant and a fuel to generate hydrogen ions, consume hydroxyl ions and generate electricity. Operation decreases the pH of the electrolyte in the vicinity of the anode to a point where carbon dioxide is evolved with a simultaneous increase of pH. This restores the carbon dioxide absorptive capacity of the solution.The patent does not suggest the use of a fuel cell to purify and concentrate chloralkali cell liquor arid, in fact, the Giner process would not be suitable for the treatment of cell liquor because the required lowering of the anolyte pH to 9 results in polarization of the anode and a se ere lowering of the current efficiency of the cell.Summary of the Invention In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a process for the simultaneous production of alkali metal hydroxide and the generation of electrical energy using a hybrid cell. The invention is particularly useful in forming a purified and concentrated caustic solution from the effluent of a ciiloralkali oell with attendant generation of electrical energy for use by the chloralkali cell. The process of the invention is characterised by a introducing flow of an aqueous solution of at least one alkali metal hydroxide as anolyte to an anode compartment of at least one hybrid cell, the hybrid cell comprising a gas diffusion anode having first and second surfaces, a diffusion barrier selectively permeableto cations and having first and second surfaces, and a gas diffusion cathode having first and second surfaces, the first surface of said anode and the first surface of said diffusion barrier defining said anode compartment, the first surface of said cathode and said second surface of said diffusion barrier defb ing a cathode compartment, said anode compartment having an inlet and an outlet, said cahode compartment having an inlet and an outlet, said anolyte flowing from the inlet to the outlet of said anode compartment b introducing flow of an aqueous fluid medium receptive to alkali metal ions as catholyte through said cathode compartment from inlet to outlet c causing, by a flow of current through an external load between said cathode and said anode and generated by oxidation of hydrogen supplied to the second surface of said gas diffusion anode and generation of hydroxide ions by reduction of an oxygen containing gas supplied to the second surface of the gas diffusion cathode, alkali metal ions to selectively pass from the anolyte through said diffusion barrier to the cathnlynse in the cathode compartment to form with cathode generated hydroxide ions, an aqueous solution of alkali metal hydroxide d withdrawing from said cathode compartment catholyte which is more concentrated in respect to alkali meta hydroxide than the aqueous medium introduest to said cathode compartment and e withdrawing from the outlet of said anode compartmert anolyte depleted in alkali metal hydroxide. The process may be conducted in a three compartment hybrid cell comprising a diaphragm permeable to both cations and anions and having first and second surfaces located between the first surface of the cathode and the second surface of the diffusion barrier,EMI5.1 the first surface of the riaphragm defining with the second surface of the diffusion barrier a central compartment, the second surface of tbc diaphragm defining with the first surface of the cathode the cathode compartment, the central compartment having all inlet and an outlet in flow communication with the inlet of the cathode compartment and wherein said flow of an aqueous fluid medium receptive to alkali metal ions is introduced as catholyte to the central compartment. Preferably air, the most economical supply of oxygen, is passed over the surface of the cathode opposite to the cathode surface in contact with the catholyte, i.e., the second cathode surface, in a quantity sufficient to remove water from the cathode to concentrate the solution of alkali metal hydroxide flowing through the cathode compartment. In sum, separation of alkali metal ions from the solution introduced to the anode compartment occurs by alkali metal ions migrating through the diffusion barrier and concentration of caustic in the cathode compartment occurs by diffusion and electrolytic consumption of water with reduction of oxygen and evaporation of water. The net result of the process is to cause the aqueous solution of alkali metal hydroxide, as it passes through the anode compartment, to be continuously depleted of hydroxyl ions, and alkali metal ions for ionic neutrality, resulting in an alkali metal ion and hydroxide concentration gradient existing between the inlet and outlet of the anode compartment. As a consequence of acceptance of alkali metal ions by the aqueous media passing through the cathode compartment and, in the case of a three compartment cell, through the central compartment as well, and generation of hydroxide ions by reduction of oxygen, the aqueous media becomes more concentrated in alkali metal hydroxide as it progresses through the cathode compartment and, if employed, the central compartment.The catholyte leaves the cathode compartment as a solution more comentrated in alkali metal hydroxide than the aqueous media introduced to the cathode or central compartment. The present invention, in its preferred application, is for the treatment rf a chloralkali cell liquor to produce a purified and concentrated aqueous caustic solution. In this application, chloralkali cell liquor containing sodium hydroxide and sodium chloride is introduced into the anode compartment of a two or three compartment hydrid cell which preferably employs thin compartments. Hydrogen, generated by the chloralkali cell, is contacted with one surface of the gas diffusion anode of the hybrid cell. The hydrogen is oxidized at the anode with the production of water.The anode of a hybrid cell is separated from the cathode compartment by a diffusion barrier selectively permeable to cations, preferably a membrane. Although the electrical energy generated as a consequence of the electrochemical oxidation and reduction reactions which occur in the hybrid cell may be fed to any load, it is advantageous to combine a number of hybrid cells in a circuit and feed the power output to a chloralkali cell to provide part of the electrical energy required to operate the chloralkali cell. The following occurs in the hybrid cell when operated on chloralkali cell liquor. Sodium ions from the introduced chloralkali cell liquor pass transverse to the flow of the anolyte chloralkali cell liquor in the anode compart mentv through the diffusion barrier and into the catliolyte flowing in the cathode compartment. If a three compartment cell is employed, the sodium ions pass through the diffusion barrier and into the catholyte flowing in the central compartment, and enter the cathode compartl.,ent as part of the aqueous medium flowing from the central compartment to the cathode compartment and by passage through the diaphragm. Hydroxyl ions generated as a consequence of reduction of oxygen at the cathode combine with the transferred sodium ions to form sodium hydroxide. Consumption of water by generate of hydroxyl ions also serves to concentrate the sodium hydroxide solution b eing formed in the cathode compartment. Additional concentration occurs by evaporation of water through the cathode into air passing over the surface of the cathode opposite to the surface in contact with the catholyte. This water evaporation also serves to cool the hybrid cell. A plurality of hyrid cells may be staged in a cascade.The cells are operated hydrodynamically in series. The anolyte flows sequentially through the anode compartments of the hybrid cells. The catholyte flows sequentially through the cathode compartments of the two compartment hybrid cells, or through both the central and cathode compartments in a three compartment cell cascade. Each hybrid cell is operated under conditions which are effective for removing only a fraction of the alkali metal from the anolyte and concentrating it Sn the catholyte.The anolyte flow may be cocurrent or countercurrent to the catholyte flow. The fluids may either ascend or descend the cascade. The cascade may include a bypass collecting a cathode compartment outlet with the initial cathode compartment inlet to improve the conductivity of the catholyte by addition of some of the produced alkali metal hydroxide to the cathode feed.

Detailed Description Alkali metal hydroxide solutions, especially solutions containing alkali metal halides, can be treated in accordance with this invention. For convenience of explanation, the feed solution typically has an alkali metal concentration between about 5 and 30 weight percent, calculated as the alkali metal hydroxide. Preferably, the solution is a chloralkali cell liquor, having a sodium hydroxide concentration of up to about 25 weight percent, preferably between about 10 and 25 weight percent sodium hydroxide, and up to about 26 weight percent sodium chloride, preferably up to about 15 weight percent sodium chloride.Solutions of other alkali metal hydroxides, such as potassium hydroxide and lithium hydroxide, can also be treated. The cell liquor can also contain other alkali metal salts, such as sodium bromide, potassium iodide, and the like. The invention is adaptive to treating liquor from chloralkali cells, including diaphragm cells, membrane cells, and the like. Methods of operating such cells and the nature of the cell liquor produced in their operation a e well known to those skilled in the art ard have been described in an extensive body of technical publications and patents. Accordingly, the ensuing description will be directed primarily to the operation of the hybrid cells alone and in combination with choralkali cells. FIG. 1 schematically depicts the operation of a two compartment hybrid cell of this invention A chloralkali cell l gltor, containing about 10 weight percentNaOH and about 15 weight percent NaCl is introduced, as anolyte, into the anode compatment of the hybrid cell.The compartments of the hybrid cell are designed to provide flow substantially in one direction from inlet to outlet without appreciable mixing, back convection, or diffusion parallel to the electrodes of molecules and ions in the compartments. Preferably a condition of plug flow is maintained. This is more easily achieved when the average distance d between anode and membrane and membrane and cathode are respectively abut lmm or less, typically about O.lmm to about lmm. The cell liquor contacts a gas diffusion anode.Hydrogen gas from any sourceiand pleferably from the chloralkali cell, contacts the opposite side of the anode.The anode provides a surface for intimate contact between the hydrogen gas to the anolyte. Hydrogen gas undergoes an oxidation reaction with the anolyte hydroxide ion at the anode which may be schematically represented as H2 20H 2H20 2e As the anolyte flows through the anode compartment, its hydroxide ion content is progressively reduced and Is water content progressively increased. FIG. 4 schematically depicts tne operation of a three compartment hybrid cell of this invention. The anode, anode compartment, and anolyte used in the threecompartment hybrid cell of FIG. 4, and the operation thereof, are substantially the same as in the twocompartment hybrid cell of FIG. 1. Separating the anode compartment from the cathode compartment of FIG. 1, or from the central cathode compartment hereinafter referred to as the central compartment of FIG. 4, is a cation permselective diffusion barrier, preferably a membrane. This is a barrier which is permeable to cations such as a sodium ion, but is relatively impermeable to anions such as the chloride ions. To maintain electroneutrality and to account for depletion of hydroxide ions from the anolyte, sodium ions, under condition of current flow through an external load, separate from the anolyte and pass through the cation permselective barrier into a catholyte passing through the cathode compartment of the hybrid cell ofFIG. 1, or the central compartment of the hybrid cell ofFIG. 4.Substantially all of the chloride ions remain in the a. alyte, along with sufficient sodium ions to electrically balance the chloride ions. The cathode compartment of the two compartment fuel cell of FIG. 1, and the central compartment of the threecompartment fuel cell of FIG. 4, are separated from the relevant anode compartment by the above mentioned catron permselective diffusion barrier. The central compartment of the three compartment cell is separated from the cathode compartment by a diaphragm which is permeable both to anions and cations, such as a semi per teable asbestos diaphragm. In the two compartment ceil of FIG. 1, an aqueous medium sucih as water or a dilute ionic solution, which may be part of the solution drawn from the anode compartment, is introduced as cathOlyte into the cathode c rparment and progressively picks up sodium ions moving through the cation permselective membrane. The catholyte contacts one surface of a gas diffusion cathode where oxygen gas, preferably from sir, undergoes a reduction reaction with the catholyte water which may be schematically represented as follows H20 1 2 2 2e 20H The generated hydroxide ions balance the sodium ions which enter the catholyte to form a caustic solution having increased caustic concentration in the direction of flow of the catholyte. Concentration is due in part to consumption of water at the cathode. In the three compartment hybrid cell of FIG. 4, an aqueous medium such as water or a dilute ionic solution, which may be part of the solution drawn from the anode compartment, is introduced as catholyte into the central compartment, and progressively picks up sodium ions moving through the cation permselective membrane. Catholyte in the cathode compartment contacts a gas diffusion type cathode where oxygen is reduced by the schematic equation H20 1 2 02 2e 20H preferably as a consequence of the passage of air over the cathode. Some of the hydroxide ions pass from the cathode compartment to the central compartment. The net effect is that the sodium hydroxide content of the catholyte increases as it flows thro ugh the central compartment. A catholyte, now of intermediate sodium hydroxide concentration, is withdrawn from the central compartment and introduced into the cathode compartment of the threecompartment hybrid cell. A proportion of the sodium ions entering the central compartment through the cationpermselective membrane continues on through the ion permeable barrier or diaphragm into the cathode compartment. When sodium hydroxide solution from the central compartment is introduced into the cathode compartment, the sodium ions which pass through the ion permeable barrier accumulate in the catholyte contacting the gas diffusion type cathode.Oxygen from the air is reduced, forming hydroxide ions to balance the sodium ions and consume water of the catholyte thus partially concentrating the sodium hydroxide solution. Contemporaneoulsy, in the operation of either the two compartment or the three compartment cell, some water from the catholyte evaporates at the opposite surface of the cathode into the air stream. For a given cathode surface area and permeability, the flow of air may be regulated to control evaporation of water from the surface of the cathode to modify the concentration of sodium hydroxide in the catholyte. In practice, the rate of addition of water to either the cathode or the central compartment, the rate of transpor of water through the cation permselective diffusion barrier into the catholyte, the rate of consumption of water at the cathode, and the rate of evaporation of water from the cathode, are all correlated so as to provide a product catholyte of desired caustic concentration. Thus, when the cell liquor, the water and the catholyte introduced to the two or three compartment hybrid cell all flow through their respective compartments concurrently, as shown in FIG. 1, and in FIG. 4, the sodium hydroxide concentration of the relevant anolyte decreases from about 12 by weight at the appropriate inlet and approaches 0.5 or. less. at tho outlet. The sodium hydroxide concentration of the relevant catholyte, by contrast, increases from about 0 at the appropriate inlet to about 40 more at the outlet.High concentration differences are achievable with currently available membranes and diaphragms. As indicated, the anolyte withdrawn from the anode compartment is substantially depleted of sodium hydroxide.However, even when the effluent from the anode compartment contains as little as 0.1 weight percent or 0.01 weight percent of sodium hydroxide, the pH of the effluent is high, i.e., above 12. The high pH of the effluent from the anode compartment is advantageous in that polarization and loss of current efficiency which can be associated with a change from an alkaline to a neutral or acid pH within the cell is minimized. The process and hybrid cell illustrated in FIG. 1 orFIG. 4 can, of course, be used to treat cell liquors having differing concentrations of alkali metal hydroxide and alkali metal halide. By regulating the flow of water or dilute aqueous alkali hydroxide into the cathode compartment of FIG.1, or into the central compartment of FIG. 4, and by the evaporation of water from the porous cathode, the concentration of the product flowing from the cathode compartment can be varied over a wide range. Thus, the range of concentrations of product alkali metal hydroxide ean be achieved at will. The hybrid cell can be arranged in a filter press type structure with a multitude of ,lementary hybrid cells connected in series forming a net hybrid cell. FIG. 2 is a partial cross sectional view of a portion of a filter press hybrid cell unit showing the sequence and arrangement of elements in the cell. There is provided gas diffusion cathodes 10 and electrically conductive gas separator and current collectors 12 which helps to define air channels 14 and hydrogen channels 16 gas diffusion anodes 18 an anolyte compartment 20 a catholyte compartment 24 and membrane 26. The following conduits are formed by insulating ported spacers 30 conduit 28 serves hydrogen channels 16 conduit 32 is for the anolyte liquor to be processed conduit 34 is for the aqueous catholyte media and conduit 36 is for the air fed to channels 14. FIG. 5 is a partial cross sectional view of a portion of another filter press type o.f hybrid cell unit showing the sequence and arrangement of elements in the cell. There is provided gas diffusion type cathodes 110 and electrically conductive gas separator and current collectors 112 which help to define air channels 114 and hydrogen channels 116 gas diffusion type anodes 118 an anolyte compartment 120 central compartment 122 the catholyte compartment 124 membrane 126 and diaphragm 128. The following conduits are formed by insulating ported spaces 132 conduit 130 which serves hydrogen channels 116 conduit 134 is for the liquor to be processed conduit 136 for water conduit 138 for fluid flow to cathode compartment 124 while conduit 140 is for feed of air to channels 114. Given the sequence of elements, such variables as the thickness and spacing of elements, the shape of the air and hydrogen channels are subject to wide variation. In addition, many different materials of construction may be employed because ths process of this invention is practiced under relatively mild conditions, phrticularly when compared with the highly oxidative and corrosive conditions found in a chloralkalki cell. Thus, any material stable to alkali metal.hydroxide and cell operating temperature may be used. Materials of construction and cell construction arrangements are described, for instance, in U.S. Patents 3,098.762 3,196,048 3,296,025 3,511,712 3,516,866 3,530,003 3,764,391 3,899,403 3,901,731 3,957,535 4,036,717 and 4,051,002 and British Patent Specifications 1,211,593 and 1,212,387, each incorporated herein by reference. The cation permselective membranes may be perfluorosulfonic aÃ…ad polymers manufactured by du Pont under the trade name Nafion and perfluorocarboxylic acid polymers manufactered by Asahi Chemical Co. Other low cost membranes prepared from sulfonated polymers, carboxylated hydrocarbon polymers, phenolic resins, polyolefins and the like, may also be used. Whatever the selected material, the membrane should, preferably have a permselectivity in 40 NaOH of at least about .0.95, an ohmic resistance not more than about 3 ohm cm and an electrosmotic coefficient of not more than about 74 gms of water per Faraday. The gas diffusion anodes and cathodes currently employed in the fuel cell att may be ased in the construction of the hybrid cells and are semi hydrophobic. They generally consist of a gas diffusion layer which may be catalytic per se or have catalytic properties induced or promoted by a noble metal and the like A suitable gas diffusion type cathode nd or anode may be formed of activated carbon which may be cdtalyzed by a noble metal and combined with a support material such as Teflon. The porous diaphragms can be made of fuel cell grade asbestos films, porous rubber battery separators, or ion exchange membranes which are permeable to both anions and cations. For the three comr artment type of hybrid cells, it is contemplated that the catholyte can be transferred from a central compartment of the hybrid cell to the cathode compartment in either or both of two ways.First, the atholyte can be withdrawn from an outlet of the central compartment and introduced into an inlet of the cathode compartment. Second, by establishing a pressure differential across a porous diaphragm, the catholyte from the central compartment can be made to flow through the diaphragm into the cathode compartment.Both means of transferring catholyte from the central compartment to the cathode compartment can be employed simultaneously. Liquid permeable polymeric films and woven or non woven fabrics may also be used as materials of construction for the porous diaphragm. The hybrid cell can be operated at any temperature which maintains the electrolytes in a liquid state and avoids the precipitation of dissolved constituents such as alkali metal halide or alkali metal hydroxide. Temperatures of from about 200C to 100 C, more preferable 400C to 700C, may be employed. Because the cell liquor from a chloralkali cell is warm and because heat is generated within the fuel cell during its operation, it is necessary to cool the cell to maintain a desired operating temperature. The cell is conveniently cooled as an incidence of evaporation of water from the catholyte through the gas diffusion cathode into the stream of air which is passed across the surface of the cathode opposite to the surface in contact with the catholyte to supply oxygen to the cathode.In a filter press type of construction, the individual cells are so thin that there is excellent heat transfer between the anode, cathode, and fluid compartments. To achieve effective cooling through the cathode by evaporation, it may be desirable to continuously introduce fresh, dry air inte the hybrid cell at a point removed from the air intake which supplies the hybrid cell. Air can be dried conveniently be passing it over cooling coils or through desiccant such as silica gel in accordance with known methods. The flow of electrolytes through the compartments of the fuel cell can be cocurrent as shown in FIG. 1 or countercurrent. Cocurrent flow is presently preferred. Air is the lowest cost source of oxygen required for the cathode and serves to carry off evaporated water. Other oxygen containing gases as well as oxygen enriched air can also be used but at greater expense. FIG. 3 shows the interr61ationships between chloralkali cells and hybrid cells used to treat the cell liquor from the chloralkali cells in accordance with this invention.

Air is supplied to the gas diffusion cathode 52 and water to cathode compartment 54. With current flow, as induced by reduction of oxygen at the cathode and oxidation of hydrogen at the anode, sodium ions pass through diffusion barrier 56 to the cathode compartment.

With current flow as induced by reduction of oxygen at the cathode and oxidation of the hydrogen at the anode, sodium ions pass through the membrane to the central and cathode compartments. Catholyte is drawn from compartment 162 by line 164.Line 166 connects the central compartment with the cathode compartment. The membrane is shown as 168 and the diaphragm as 170. The hybrid cell of either FIG. 3 or FIG. 6 is in series with the chloralkali ell and will produce a fraction of the power consumed by the chloralkali cell.Thus, while additional electric current from an outside source is required to operate the chloraliali cell and is shown as power supply , the external energy required to operate the chloralkali cell is reduced. In a typical operation of the two compartment hybrid cell, a cell liquor containing about 10 percent by weightNaOH and 15 percent by weight NaCl is supplied to anode compartment 50. Water is introduced to cathode compartment 54. In a three compartment hybrid cell, the cell liquor is supplied to anode compartment 154 and water is introduced to central compartment 160. The products withdrawn from either cell may be approximately a 15 to 22 percent by weight NaCl solution, containing a small amount of NaOH and from the appropriate anode compartment, a purified, substmatially chloride free 40 percent by weight NaOH solution from the appropriate cathode compartment. Althcugh the hybrid cell may be operated in such a manor as to remove substantially all of the alkali metal hydroxide from the cell liquor, as indicated, it can be more efficient to operate the cell so as to leave a small proportion of the sodium hydroxide in the effluent from the anode compartment. This is done to improve the efficiency of the hybrid ce l. The effluent from the anode compartment of a maiik hybrid cell run at high efficiency may contain about 2 alkali metal hydroxide but this can then be fed to the anode compartment of another, finishing , hybrid cell operated under conditions which are effective for removing the last few percent of the alkali metal from the anolyte. The conditions in such a finishing cell can be regulated to produce a concentrated alkali metal hydroxide product even though the feed to the anode compartment is relatively dilute. However, because the concentration of alkali metal hydroxide from such a dilute feed is accomplished at lower current efficiency than the concentration from more concentrated feed, the cell produces a smaller amount of useable power. In the latter case, the cell can be rifle under short circuited conditions which are effective for concentrating the alkali metal hydroxide but produce no useable power. However, because the bulk of the separation is accomplished in the main hybrid cell under cou itions providing higher efficiency, the overall efficiency of the process is not seriously diminished. Although a main hybrid cell and a finishing cell may be operated in such a manner as to remove first the bulk and then the remainder of substantially all of the alkali metal hydroxide from the cell liquor, it can be more efficient to operate a cascade of hybrid cells hydrodynamically in series so as to remove only a small proportion of the sodilan hydroxide in each anode compartment. When this is done, the current efficiency of the individual hybrid cells can be kept high to maximize the yield of electric current in each stage of the cascade. FIG. 7t is a schematic illustration of a cocurrent cascade of individual hybrid cells showing the sequence and arrangement of the cells in the cascade. There are provided individual hybrid cells 70 which may be either two compartment or three compartment hybrid cells as discussed herein. The individual cells which each include an anode compartment 72 separated from a cathode compartment 74 by diffusion barrier 76, are preferably stacked in a vertical cascade ard are operated hydrodynamically in series. Cell liquor from a chloralkali cell is introduced as anolyte to the inlet of the anode compartment of hybrid cell 78 at one end of the cascade. The anolyte flows through this anode compartment and is partially depleted of alkali metal hydroxide.The effluent from the anode compartment is withdrawn from the outlet and is introduced as anolyte into the anode compartment inlet of a second hybrid cell 80. The anolyte passes through the remainder of the cascade in this manner. The effluent withdrawn from the anode compartment of the hybrid cell 82 at the other end of the cascade is substantially depleted of alkali metal hydroxide. The catholyte also flows in series through the cells.For two compartment cell cascades, the catholyte is introduce into the cathode compartment inlet of hybrid cell 8 at one end of the cascade. The catholyte is made to flow serially through the individual cathode compartments and is partially enriched in alkali metal hydroxide during each stage of the cascade. For three compartment cell cascades, the catholyte flows t hrough both the central and cathode compartmenLs of an individual cell before passing to the next stage of the cascade. The flow of catholyte is preferably cocurrent through the central and cathode compartments, although it need not be cocurrent to the flow of the anolyte. The catholyte withdrawn from the appropriate cathode compartment outlet at the opposite end of the cascade contains P purified solution of caustic concentrated alkali metal hydroxide. Each hybrid cell is operated under conditions which are effective for removing only a fraction of the alkali metal from the anolyte and concentrating it in the catholyte. The fraction may be determined by the number of cells operated in the cascade. Any number of stages can be employed in the cascade. There is no upper limit except for economies of cost and size required by the user. Consequently, in the cascade, as distinguished from a sizzle hybrid cell or the filter press hybrid cell systems previously described, each individual anode operates under a proportionately smaller anolyts concentration gradient between the inlet and outlet of the anode compartment.As a consequence voltage efficiency of the individual cells, and of the cascade as a whole, may be increased to its practical maximum using diffusion anodes commercially available. For hybrid cell cascades using these anodes, the greater the number of stages, the smaller the concentration gradient of alkali metal hydroxide in each stage, and the higher the voltage efficiency of the individual cells. As depicted in FIG. 7A, both the anolyte and the catholyte enter the cascade in the same stage. Cocurrent flow maintains a condition of plug flow in the compartments and to minimize any cross diffusion of caustic related to membrane imperfections such as holes, for example. As depicted in FIG. 7B, the anolyte and the catholyte enter a opposite ends of the cascade. Hybrid cell 84 at one end of the cascade serves both as the final stages for the anolyte and as the initial stage for the catholyte. The concentrations of sodium hydroxide in this cell are at their minimum values e.g. anolyte at 0.5 NaOH or less, catholyte at about 10 NaOH. Hybrid cell 86 at the opposite end of the cascade, serves as the initial stage for the anolyte and as the final stage for the catholyte, sodium hydroxide concentrations are maximized anolyte at about 10 NaOH, catholyte at about 40 NaOH. However, within a countercurrent cascade, as compared to a cocurrent cascade, there is the least possible average difference in caustic concentration across the diffusion barriers. Countercurrent circulation may be practiced to minimize concentration differences of the caustic across the diffusion barrier of each cell. As concentration gradients increase across the diffusion barrier, chemical driving forces are thought to promote back diffusion of the caustic product from a high strength catholyte to the lower strength anolyte, which reduces the concentration of sodium hydroxide in the product and the overall efficiency of the process. Many commercially available diffusion barriers, such as the membranes discussed previously, exhibit a decrease in permselectivity at concentration differences across the membrane above about 300 by weight caustic to the detriment of their efficiency in a hybrid cell in the process of the invention. A counter current circulation may increase efficiency and product purity by minimizing the average concentration differential of sodium hydroxide throughout the cascade. The cascade may be operated with either ascending or descending electrolytes for cocurrent circulation modes.A countercurrent cascade may be operated either with an ascending anolyte or an ascending catholyte. It may be desirable to add a small portion of product catholyte to the catholyte entering the cascade, which may be pure water, to increase its conductivity. For this purpose, bypass 88 shown in both FIG. 7A and FIG. 7B may be included to provide flow of product catholyte from the last catholyte stage of the cascade to the feed of the first catholyte stage. Feed strengths ranging from aboveO to 25 percent by weight NaOF. and preferably between about 10 and about 15 percent by weight are representative of by pass caustic provided for efficient operation. Although the present invention has been described with reference to particular details and embodiments thereof, these details are intended to illustrate the invention, the scope of which is defined in the following claims.
