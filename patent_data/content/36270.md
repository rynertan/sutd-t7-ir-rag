## Description
ADDITIVES FOR HYDROCARBON FUELSThis invention relates to additives for hydrocarbon fuels.According to the invention there is provided an additive for a liquid hydrocarbon fuel comprising the following components in the following ranges of relative proportions in by volume of the total volume of these components halogen substituted aromatic compound 33 57,5 aliphatic ketone 30 0 aromatic amine 30 10 organic phosphate 5 2 aromatic alcohol . 2 0,5Preferred additives have the components in the following relative proportions halogen substituted aromatic compound 44.31 54.00 aliphatic ketone . 25,31 21.60 aromatic amine 25.31 21.60 organic phosphate 3.80 2.16 aromatic alcohol 1.27 The additive is preferably dispersed in a carrier, preferably a liquid hydrcarbon carrier, e.g. oil in the range 10 second to 60 second,preferably 35 second oil.Preferred additives in such a carrier have the components within the following ranges in by volume halogen substituted aromatic compound 35.0 15.0 aliphatic ketone 30.0 O aromatic amine 30.0 5.0 organic phosphate 1.0 0.01 aromatic alcohol 1.0 O. 3 carrier balance to make up 100 Apreferred carrier dispersed additive has the following composition in by volume carrier 37.35 halogen substituted aromatic compound 30.00 aliphatic ketone 15.00 aromatic amine 15,00 organic phosphate 2,00 aromatic alcohol 0,65Also according to the invention, a liquid hydrocarbon fuel comprises additive with or without a carrier as defined above, preferably in the proportion by volume of to 1 part additive to 1000 parts of fuel, preferably 1 part additive to 1000 parts of fuel.The invention may be performed in various ways and some specificExamples will now be described by way of illustration Example 1The additive comprises the following components ip the following ranges in S by volume dichlorobenzene 33 to 57.5 diisobutylketone 30 to 20 aniline 30 to 20 trixylyl phosphate 5 to 2 xylenol 2 to 0.5 Example 2An additive dispersed in a carriervhas the following components by volume 35 second oil carrier 37.35 dichlorobenzene kazoo diisobutylketone 15.00 aniline 15.00 trixylyl phosphate 2,00 xylenol 0,65 The components are of commercially available quality. The hydrocarbon carrier is preferably oil in the range 10 second to 60 second, preferably 35 second. Other suitable carriers are for example petrol, paraffin, white spirit or fuel oils.The viscosity of the fuel oil may vary.The additive may, for example, be used with the following liquid hydrocarbon fuels petrol, diesel oil, paraffin for domestic heaters, kerosene and other fuels for jet engines, industrial fuel oil.The additive with carrier is preferably added to the fuel in the proportion of 1 part additive, including carrier, per 1000 parts fuel by volume, but the amount of additive added may be varied to suit requirements, for example it may be more than 1 part per 1000 or it could be as low as v part per 1000 or even less.An alternative carrier is a vegetable oil for example castor oil or palm oil.It is possible to add the additive direct to the fuel without prior dispersion in a carrier. This is particularly applicable where the fuel is present in a large volume, for example in a commercial jet propelled aircraft.The specific formulation of the additive of the invention may need to be adjusted according to the kind of fuel to which it is to be added. For example when the additive is to be used with heavy fuel oils, for example 900 seconds oil, the quantity of amine present is preferably towards the lower end of the range particularly in the range 15 10 percent by volume based on the total volume of additive excluding carrier or 15 5 percent by volume based on the total volume of additive plus carrier.In the case of an additive for petrol that is to say gasoline the aliphatic ketone can be omitted completely.Consumption of hydrocarbon fuel with the additive present for the same output is less than the consumption of the same fuel but without the additive.It is thought that the additive achieves this reduction in fuel consumption by increasing the proportion of fuel usefully burnt. In the case of a vehicle internal combustion engine there is an increase in achieved brake horse power and it may be possible to achieve an equivalent performance with a lower grade of petrol. The halogen substituted aromatic compound is preferably a polychlorinated aromatic compound such as o or mdichlorobenzene, dichlorotoluene or trichlorobenzene. The aliphatic ketone is for example 2,6 dimethyl heptan LJ one, 2 ethyl6 methyl heptan 4 one, 2 propyl 6 methyl heptan 4 one or 2 propyl 6 ethyl heptan Il one. The 2,6 dimethyl heptan 4 one diisobutyl ketone is preferred.The aromaticfiamine is preferably aniline or methyl aniline.The aromatic alcohol may preferably be chosen from one of the xyleneols.
