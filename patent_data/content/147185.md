## Description
THERAPEUTIC USE OF CYTIDYL DIPHOSPHOCHOLINE TO INCREASE NEURONAL ACETYLCHOLINE BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to the administration of cytidyl diphosphocholine CDP choline that dissociates to form choline, along with a drug, in order to treat human disorders by increasing acetylcholine levels in brain and other tissues. There are a number of diseases which affect acetyl choline containing neurons in the brain or other tissues, and which are treated by drugs that cause undesired side effects by diminishing acetylcholine S release there also exist diseases now treated by other drugs in which ne potency and or efficacy of the drugs could be improved by combining them with a source of choline in order thereby to enhance the release of acetylcholine.Such diseases include both those primarily involving the brain including diseases of higher cortical functions, psychiatric illnesses, movement disorders, old age, senility,Alzheimer s disease, Tardive dyskinesia, Parkinson s disease certain affective disorders including mania, ataxias includingFriedreich s ataxia, the dyslexias, the behavioral and neurological syndromes seen after brain trauma and or anoxia, and those involving the peripheral nervous system, e.g., neuromuscular disorders such as myasthenia gravis as well as post stroke rc habilitation.Tardive dyskinesia, for example, is a particular ly common movement disorder associated with inadequate release ofbrain acetylcholine as a result of drug administration for the initial brain disease e.g., psychosis . Tardive dyskinesi is a choreic movement disordex characterized by involuntary twitches in the tongue, lips, jaw and extremities. It typical occurs in susceptible persons after chronic ingestion of neuro leptic.drugs and may involve an imbalancein the postulated relation between dopaminergic and cholinergic neurons and the basal ganglions.Thus, drugs that.either block catecholamine synthesis e.g., alpha methyl p tryosne , deplete the brain of monoarnines e.g., reserpine, tetrabenazine or phenothiazines, haloperidol often suppress tardive dyskinesia, whereas drugs that indirectly stimulate dopamine receptors e.g. amphetamine, 1evodopa often exacerbate the abnormal movements. Drugs assumed to increase the amount of acetylcholine within brain synapses e.g., physostigmine, deanol , also tend to suppress the chorea of tardive dyskinesia, whereas anticholinergics e. g., scopolamine , make it worse. Not all choline analogues result in an increase in brain choline levels when administered to an animal. For example, deanol is a choline analogue which does not cause increased brain choline levels. However when choline is administered by injection or by dietary supplementation increa sed blood choline levels in the rat results this, in turn, increases choline levels in cholinergic neurons within the brain and elsewhere in the body, thereby accelerating the synthesis of acetylcholine, increasing tissue acetylcholine levels, and increasing the amounts of acetylcholine released into brain synapses.In human beings, oral doses of choline or of lecithin, a naturally occurring compound that dissociates to choline,were found to cause dose related increases in blood choline levels of sufficient magnitude based on the studies on rats to enhance brain acetylcholine synthesis and release choline levels in the cerebrospinal fluid also rose in parallel.It has also been re ported in four human patients that the administration of choline decreased the choreiform movements of tardive dyskinesia no data were provided as to whether or not the drug given concur rently for psychosis haloperidol, 3 mg per day continued.to be effective during the brief period of choline administration, and it was concluded that the apparent effectiveness of choline had to be interpreted with caution, since ... all four patients .with tardive dyskinesia could have been gradually improving during the study since this disease is characterized by extreme variability of clinical course.Thus, prior to this invention, it was known that choline and some choline analogues can be utilized to increase brain choline levels while other choline analom es do not result in increased brain choline levels. SUvRRY OF THE INsENTIoM This invention is based upon the discovery that cy tidyl diphosphocholine CPD choline , when administered concom . itantly with a drug, can, by increasing neuronal acetylcholine levels, 1 reduce or prevent undesirable side effects of the drug associated with inadequate acetylcholine release, and or 2 potentiate the effectiveness of the drug. The CDP choline and drug may be administered orally such as in tablet, capsule or liquid form. or parenterally by intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. The process of this invention is usefu even with patients having a prior history of the undesirable side effect or of suboptimal therapeutic response, or of therapeutic responses requiring a very large drug dose, but who con tnue taking the drug. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS In accordance with this invention, CDP choline is orally administered to a patient alone or prior to or together with a drug in order to increase blood levels of choline, and thereby to increase the level of acetylcholine in the brain.The acetylcholine is synthesized from choline and acetyl CoA in a reaction catalyzed by choline acethyltransterase CAT . Xt has been found that the administration of CDP choline potentiates the drug by reducing the incidence or suppressing side ef feces of he primary drug and or that lower dosages of the primary drug are needed to attain the desired effects of the drug.While the results obtained will vary from patient to patient, the reduced side effects and increased efficacy observed are sufficiently significant as to justify the conclusion that their reduction is caused by administration of CDP choline. It is surprising that the administration of CD choline results in increased levels of brain choline since CDP choline is known to be incorporated directly by cells into their own membrane lecithin. Rence, it would be anticipated that the gut cells would utilize the CUP choline rather than breaking it down to liberate choline. There are a number of brain and peripheral diseases involving cholinergic neurons that are presently treated with drugs that are only sometimes effective, or that require very large doses of the drugs with correspondingly greater cost and incidence of side effects some of these diseases can be more effectively treated by combining the existing drug therapy with concomitant choline or natural or synthetic compounds that dissociated to form choline. Onebexample is the mania phase of manic depressive psychoses, which is currently treated with lithium salts. These salts, as.a biochemical side effect, interfere with the uptake of choline into the brain this tends to reduce brain acetylcholine levels, which exacerbates the mania.The co administration of CDP choline with the lithium salts would allow more effective treatment of the mania, and a reduction in the lithium dose needed by most patients. Another example is myasthenia gravis, a peripheral disease involving the cholinergic nerves that innervate skeletal muscle. The current mode of treatment involves giving drugs like neostigmine Protigmin that increase acetylcholine levels in neuromuscular synapses by blocking the degr2dation of this neurotransmitter. Were.CDP choline, a compound that dissociates to form choline, to be given concomitantly with the choline sterase inhibitor, the resulting increases in acetylcholine levels would both potentiate the effect of the cholinesterase inhibitor and allow for a reduction in its dose. T,7hen CDP choline is administered alone, it is useful in treating the following.disorders which may be associated with inadeauate release of acetylcholine old age, senility, Alzheimer s disease, tardive dyskinesia,Parkinson s disease, certain affective disorders including mania, ataxias including Freidreich s ataxia, the dyslexias, the behavioral and neurological syndromes seen after brain trama and or anoxic, and peripheral neuromuscular disorders including myasthenia gravis and post stroke rehabilitation. Some of the drugs utilized in the present invention are those which cause significant undesirable effects. Repre sentative of such drugs are neuroleptics, such as the pheno thiazines including thioridozine MELLARIL , fluphenazine PROLIXIN , trifluoperazine and chlorpromazine THORAZINE the thioxanthenes including chlorprothixene TRARACTON and thiothixene NAVANE , the butyrophenones including haloperi dol HALDOL an indolic compounds incuding molindone MOBAN that are used in the treatment of such diseases as schizophrenia, Buntington s disease and Tourette s syndrome. Other drugs that cause undesired effects include psychomotor OR date RITALIN that are used to treat patients with minimal brain dysfunction, hyperactivity and specific dyslexias. The effects of some other drugs utilized in this in vention are potentiated. Representative of such drugs are 1 isoxsuprine VASODILAN and dihydroergotamines HYDERGINE e or piracetam or the like that are used in the treatment of senility 2 gluco cortico steroids such as triamcinotone ARISTOCORT and predinsone METICORTEN and anti choline sterase drugs such as neostigmine PROSTIGMIN and pyridostig mine MESTINON that are used to treat neuromuscular dis eases, including polymyesitls and myasthenia gravis 3 lithium ESKALITH that is used to treat manic depressive illness and 4 tranquillizers such as phenobarbitol LUMINAL and diazepam VALIUM that are used to treat anxiety psychoneur osis. The CDP choline is administered so that a choline level of at least about 20 30 nanomoles ml and usually between about 10 and 50 n moles ml is attained in the patient s blood stream. Por example, when administering CDP chloride in the form of capsules or tablets, suitable dosages are from about 1 to 30 g day, preferably 3 20 g day taken in divided doses 500 to 1000 mg cap or tab. When CDP chloride is administered in liquid form admixed with a conventional liquid Carrier such as a sweetened elixir or the like, from about 1 to 10 grams 15 ml, preferably from about 2 to 5 grams 15 ml can be utilized. In the process of this invention, the CDP choline is adminLstered alone or prior to or concomitantly with the drug . When administered prior to the drug, the period of time betweenCDP choline administration and drug administration must be less than when acetylcholine concentration reduction begins to occur in the brain. Generally, the period of time between administrations is less than about 36 hours, preferably less than about 24 hours. The following example illustrates the present inven tionbar.d is not intended to limit the same. EXAMPLE I This example illustrates that CDP choline, when admin .istered to laboratory rats causes an increase in blood plasma and brain choline levels. In this study, the effects of CDP choline 2.25 g kg body weight were compared to the effects of equimolar choline chloride or phoschatidylcholine PC 6n plasma choline levels in rats with jugular cannulas. CDP choline.ele vated plasma choline evels by 50 after 4 hours its time course being more similar to PC than to choline chloride. In a separate experiment, whole brain choline levels in rats were measured. Laboratory rats were given CDP choline 1.5 g kg body weight or eguimolar choline chloride and were killed after 1, 5 and 24 hours by focussed microwave irradia tion to the head as were controls which were not administered choline chloride or CD choline. Whole brain choline was ele vated relative to controls at all times and at all times tested in both choline treated and CD choline treated animals. Peak values of choline occurred at 5 hours. Choline levels returned near baseline by 24 hours. Since administration of CDP choline raises brain choline, brain acetylcholine levels also are raised, Cohen et al, Life Sciences, 16 1095 1102, 1975, and thereby caudate tyrosine hydroxylase is activated, Ules et al, Science, 194 1060 1061, 1976.
