# VEHICLE DETECTING SYSTEM

## Abstract
There is a vehicle detecting system for detecting the number of vehicles which pass the roadway, thereby realiz ing the smooth flow of vehicles. This system comprises a transmitting coil 2 and a receiving coil 4 which are arranged on both sides of the vehicle detection area set over the roadway a driving circuit 3 to supply a high frequency exciting current to the transmitting coil and vehicle detect ing circuit 5 to output a vehicle detection signal in response to a change in level or phase of the electrical signal which is induced in the receiving coil. The detection signal is output ted when the signal level exceeds a predetermined value or when the signal phase exceeds a predetermined angle. One or a plurality of pairs of transmitting and receiving coils may be buried under the roadway surface or on or above the roadway at regular intervals. With this system, the installing construction of the coils is simplified and the possibility of the occurrence of the accident such as disconnection of the coil is reduced. The vehicle on the roadway can be certainly detected.
