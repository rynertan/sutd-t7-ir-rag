# Optical apparatus for monitoring for thread breakage.

## Abstract
A laser beam scanning device 17 is provided for monitoring for thread breakage in tufting machines 31 in which a carrier web 16 is passed from below to a spiked roller 11 and is deflected by the spiked roller into a substan tially horizontal direction so that it can be passed beneath a row of needles 12 . The row of needles 12 periodically intro duce threads into the carrier web 16 by up and down move ment in order to form tufted material. A narrow retro reflecting strip 14 is arranged directly below and behind the tips of the needles and directly above the tufted material 15 parallel to the row of needles 12 and substantially at right angles to the surface of the tufted material. The scanned light beam 18 is regularly interrupted by the threads which pass through the needles 13 when the needles are in the elevated open position and, after reflection at the retroreflecting strip 14 and other optical elements is received by a photoelectric receiver 19 where it generates an AC output signal. If one of the threads is broken then the scanning beam 18 is not interrupted at this position and this is recognised in the output signal from the light receiver 19 .
