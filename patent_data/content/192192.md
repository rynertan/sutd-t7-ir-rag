# Wire stub retainer and handle opening spring.

## Abstract
A clip like, resilient wire stub retainer and handle open ing spring adapted for secure positioning on the pivoting joint area of a wire cutting pliers having a pair of cutting edges extends along a first cutting edge of the pliers in an overlap ping manner so as to engage and retain a severed wire stub portion in contact with a second cutting edge of the pliers until the pliers are released in preventing the wire stub from being projected away from the pliers. The resilient clip like retainer spring biases the pliers to the open configuration and includes a sheath like covering on the wire engaging portion thereof to enhance its wire retention characteristics.
