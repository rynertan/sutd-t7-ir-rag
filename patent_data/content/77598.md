# Electrohydraulic doser actuator.

## Abstract
An electrohydraulic doser actuator of the kind compris ing a step piston the axial position of which is variable as a function of metered doses of pressurized fluid which are vented to or from a control chamber by a first on off valve connecting the latter to a high pressure source or a second on off valve connecting it to a low pressure source, said valves being normally closed and thus establishing a hydraulic lock on the piston to maintain same in its last reached axial position. In order to improve the precision of positioning of the piston 58, 60 , the invention provides for a pair of additional on off valves 52, 53 mounted in parallel relationship to the main on off valves 51, 54 , respectively, and having a smaller opening than said main valves for the control of small adjustments of the position of the piston. For use particularly in gas turbine control systems.
