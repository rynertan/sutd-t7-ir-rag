# A sealing assembly, particularly for bearings.

## Abstract
A sealing assembly is described, composed of a rigid reinforcement and an annular elastomeric sealing element provided with a radially inner lip extending and projecting from a root portion of the elastomeric element the lip is shaped in section as an oblique V with respect to the axis of the elastomeric element and is provided with two portions of reduced thickness formed in correspondence with the root portion and the vertex of the V, which sub divide the lip into two body portions able to cooperate with sealing sur faces of one of the members between which the sealing assembly is mountable, and which can rotate relatively with respect to one another.
