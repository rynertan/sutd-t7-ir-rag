## Description
The present invention relates to biologically active peptides, their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, processes for their preparation and their application as therapeutic agents,namely for the treatment of addictive behavior and opiate and alcohol dependence. Opiate and alcohol dependence constitutes one of the major problems plaguing modern civilization. In an attempt to curb the desire for alcohol or opiates by persons addicted to such substances, a variety of chemical substances have been investigated. However, while some of these substances have the ability to lessen the desire for alcohol or opiates, many of these substances are, themselves, addictive and cause the recipient to experience withdrawal symptoms at the cessation of administration. Accordingly, a need continues to exist for substances which can curb the desire of alcohol or opiate dependent mammals, particularly humans, for alcohol or opiates, without eliciting addictive behavior, themselves. Peptides 1982, pages 481 486 discloses that synthesized double peptides of formula Tyr X Phe NH ₂ have opiate agonist and antagonist activities where X represents D Ala or D Thr. EP A 0083849 discloses that dimers of peptide amides including the bridging group NH CH₂ Highlights in Receptor Chemistry, pages 149 168, 1983 disclose various dermorphin like peptides which include a D Ala moiety as an essential moiety. Peptides are disclosed having opiate like activity which include the sequence Tyr D Ala Phe . Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide peptides and compositions containing them which are able to curb the desire of alcohol or opiate dependent mammals for alcohol or opiates. It is also an object of this invention to provide peptides and compositions containing them which are able to curb the desire of alcohol or opiate dependent mammals for alcohol or opiates without eliciting addictive behavior, themselves. Further, it is also an object of the present invention to provide a method of preparing the peptides of the formula I as herein under defined. According to the present invention, peptides are now provided having the formula I wherein Salts of peptides according to the invention with pharmaceutically acceptable salts are within the scope of the invention. Such acid addition salts can be derived from a variety of inorganic and organic acids such as sulfuric, phosphoric, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, nitric, sulfamic, citric, lactic, pyruvic, oxalic, maleic, succinic, tartaric, cinnamic, acetic, trifluoroacetic, benzoic, salicylic, gluconic, ascorbic and related acids. wherein Y, A and B are as defined above, and X has the same meanings of X stated above but not hydrogen atom, with a compound of the formula III For the protection of the carboxyl group the following protective groups may, for example, be employed methyl, ethyl, t butyl, benzyl, p nitrobenzyl or fluorenylmethyl. The hydroxy functions of hydroxy amino acids may be protected by suitable protecting groups, throughout all the synthesis or only during a few steps, or may be kept unprotected. Deprotecting reactions are carried out according to methods known in polypeptide chemistry. The condensation between an amino group of one molecule and a carboxyl group of another molecule to form the peptide linkage may be carried out through an activated acyl derivative such as a mixed anhydride, an azide or an activated ester, or by direct condensation between a free amino group and a free carboxyl group, in the presence of a condensing agent such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, alone or together with a racemization preventing agent, such as N hydroxysuccinimide or 1 hydroxybenzotriazole. The condensation may be carried out in a solvent such as dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, pyridine, acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran or N methyl 2 pyrrolidone. The reaction temperature may be from 30 C to ambient temperature. The reaction time is generally from 1 to 120 hours. The scheme of synthesis, the protecting groups and the condensing agents are selected so as to avoid the risk of racemization. The compounds according to the invention exhibit a therapeutic utility for the treatment of addictive behaviour and alcohol and opiate dependence. These compounds are of particular interest as they are devoid of opiate activity in vivo after systemic administration. Moreover, these compounds have no addicting liability. The studies were carried out on experimental animals as follows Male rats were instrumentally conditioned to the i.c.v. self administration of morphine following the technique described by J.R. Weeks and R.G. Collins Psychopharmacol. 1979 Repeated administration of raising doses of the compounds were performed in mice and rats in order to exclude, after the discontinuation of treatments and or after the administration of the opioid antagonist naloxone 10 mg Kg, s.c. , the precipitation of signs of withdrawal. No signs of withdrawal syndrome were ever observed, nor did the present compounds prove able to substitute for morphine when administered to morphine dependent rats. Dermorphin, an opiate like heptapeptide was used as a standard compound. The pharmacological profiles of dermorphin,compound XV and compound X are set forth in the following table The compounds according to the invention have also been shown to exhibit a similar activity observed in studies in mice. The studies were carried out on experimental animals according to the procedure described in D.B. Goldstein in J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. Preferred compounds according to the present invention are listed below In this specification symbols and abbreviations are those commonly used in peptide chemistry see Allyl group and Ppa, pipecolic acid.
