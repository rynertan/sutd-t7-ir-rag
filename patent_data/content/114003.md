## Description
ANTIANDROGEN AND ANTIBIOTIC TREATMENT OF ACNE AND PHARMACEVTICAL PREPARATIONS THEREFORThe present invention relates to the treatment of acne vulgaris in male and female subjects.This condition is in certain cases resistant to conventional treatment with oral antibiotics and topical preparations such as benzoyl peroxide or chlorhexidine. Severe cases may fail to resolve despite years of such conventional treatment and may involve progressive scarring of the face which causes distress in later life when the active phase has abated.It has now been found that the administration of an antiandrogen, in combination with an antibiotic can produce a very remarkable improvement in severe cases of acne vulgaris in both men and in women and is an effective treatment also in milder cases.Accordingly, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical formulation for use in treating acne vulgaris ty topical or systemic administration Which formulation oarprises in oombination at least one anti androgen and at least one antibiotic. For systemic administration, the formulation provides for the use of the antiandrogen with progesterone like properties e.g. cyproterone acetate in unit dosage form of an arrount of at least lOmg daily given over 10 days or lOOng or more in total given during a complete cycle over 21 28 days e.g. about 3.5mg to 5.0mg daily or as a single or divided dose.An anti androgen is herein defined as an agent which suppresses the secretion of androgens frcm either the adrenal glands or testes or ovaries either by suppressing gonadotrophins or ACTH secretion or reducing androgen secretion directly from the adrenal glands, ovaries or testes themselves, or is effective locally within the tissues by either displacing androgen from its tissue receptor or competing with its action, or which has opposite actions to androgens e.g. oestrogen or impairs the conversion of an androgen substrate to its biologically more active form as testosterone or dihydrotestosterone e.g. azelaic acid, cimetidine, or 5 alpha reductase inhibitors such as progesterone , or inhibits any other way the synthesis and or the secretion and or the action of androgens.Preferably, the formulations according to this invention include at least one oestrogen e.g ethinyloestradiol or oestradiol benzoate, preferably in combination with at least one non oestrogenic antiandrogen such as a progesterone like compound such as medroxyprogestosterone acetate or cyproterone acetate. Among the nose nonocestrogenic anti androgen compounds which may be employed cyproterone acetate is particularly preferred, particularly for formulations other than topical preparations, e.g. oral or injectable systemic preparations.The anti androgens used are preferably ones Which have a subatantial effect in decreasing sebum secretion.For topical preparations, medroxyprogesterone acetate with an oestrogen and the antibiotic is a preferred codbination, since cyproterone acetate is not absorbed through the skin. The present invention includes a pharmaceutic21 fontulation for topical use in treating acne vulgaris in Which ooqprises medroxyprogesterone acetate, at least one oestrogen and at least one antibiotic with or without retinoic acid or its derivatives or analogues or salicylic acid .The invention includes a systemic method for the treatment of acne vulgaris which method comprises administering in combination an antiandrogen, e.g. a oombination of cyproterone acetate and at least one oestrogen, and at least one antibiotic.For oral formulations administration of the antibiotic is preferably at least once per day, more preferably twt daily.The oral administration of cyproterone acetate and the oestrogen to ferrale patients should however be cyclic, the combination being effective as an oral contraceptive.Cyproterone acetate may be administered orally for up to 21 days of each cycle depending on dosage. Since cyproterone acetate in larger doses enters the tissues and accumulates producing a depot effect, a single large dose may be sufficient in each cycle.The oestrogen is preferably administered orally for from 21 to 28 days of the cycle, perferably about 21 days. Only one oral dose per day is required of the cyproterone acetate and oestrogen but the dose for any day may be split if desired.Cyproterone acetate is an anti androgenic compound of the formula EMI4.1 CYPROTERONE ACETATE 1,2 methylene 6 chloro 4,6 pregnadiere 3,20 dione 17 acetate 91 It has been used previously in the treatment of men for control of libido in severe hypersexuality and has been proposed for use in treating precocious puberty.The formulations of the present invention may be designed for oral or parenteral administration. Although the formulations could be for administration by injection, they will most conveniently be for oral administration, e.g. as tablets, capsules or solutions or suspensicns. They may however be formulated as Creams or Lotions for topical administration or as injectable solutions or suspensions for subcutaneous injection or for other forms of injection. They may generally be formulated for any of the know routes of pharmaceutical administration. Preferably, a formulation for oral administration will contain from 10 to 300mg, preferably about 50mg, of cyproterone acetate per unit dosage form, e.g. per tablet, the suitable daily dose being from 10 to 300mg, preferably 50 to 100mg e.g. 50mg The identity of the oestrogen used is not critical. Ethinyl cestradiol is preferred. The oestrogen may be present as an antiandrogen or may be provided to provide a contraceptive effect in oral preparations for wanes since administration of anti androgens such as cyproterone acetate during pregnancy would be highly undesirable. Oestrogen has the beneficial effect when administered orally to women of raising plasma sex hormone binding globulin SHBG levels thereby diminishing free biologically active testosterone and other androgen levels. A suitable dose rate for ethinyloestradiol would be 20uy to 60ug per day orally, preferably 30 to 40ug. The antibiotic used may be any of those generally know as being suitable for use in treating acne. In particular, the antibiotic may be a tetracycline type antibiotic such as tetracycline itself or ch lortetracycl ine, erythromycin, trimethoprim, sulphamethoxazole, clindamycin, demeclocycline, minocycline or a mixture of two or more of these. Generally, the nature of the antibiotic is not critical and it may be any antibiotic normally considered suitable for topical application or any antiseptic agent. These antibiotics may of course where appropriate be in the form of their pharmaceutically acceptable salts or other derivatives. The antibiotic employed may be used in one of the commercially available forms. These include septrin , trimethaprim and sulphamethoxazole. Deteclo is a combination of tetracycline hydrochloride, chlortetracycline hydrochloride and demeclocyclinethydro chloride. Suitable antibiotic contents for unit dosage forms of a composition according to this invention will by way of example be as follows Tetracycline 25mg to 2g, more preferably 50mg to 1g, e.g. 62.5 to 500 mg Demeclocyline tetracycline chlortetracycline 3 to 700mg tetracycline, 3 to 700mg chlortetra cycline, 18 to 420mg demeclocyline, or most preferably, 30 to 350mg tetracycline, 30 to 350mg chlortetracycline, 18 to 210mg demeclocycline, or still more preferably, 60 to 130mg tetracycline, 60 to 130mg chlortetracycline, and 35 to 140mg demeclocycline.Clindamycin 13mg to 4g, more preferably 25mg to 2g, eg 25mg to 1.5gTrimethoprim sulphamethoxazole 20 to 320mg trimethoprim 100mg to 3.2g sulphamethoxazole, more preferably, 40 to 160mg trimethoprim 200mg to 1.6g sulphamethoxazole,Erythromycin 250mg to 3g, more preferably 50mg to 1.5g, eg 65mg to ig. Suitable dosage rates for the antibiotic constituent of the treatment of the invention are Erythromycin 50mg to 3g per day, preferably 125mg to lg per day.Deteclo half to 6 tablets per day preferably 1 to 4 tablets per day.Clindamycin 25mg to 4g per day, more preferably 50mg to 3g per day eg. 150mg per day preferably in two equal doses.Septrin half to 8 tablets per day, preferably 1 to 2 tablets per day.Minocycline hydrochloride Minocin 20 to 500mg per day, Preferably 25 to 250mg per day. More preferably 50 to 100mg per day. It should be understood that any antibiotic generally suitable for treating acne may be used. In order to facilitate the accurate maintenance of the dosage required when the active components are to be orally administered to female subjects, it is desirable that all of the active ingredients be presented in a calendar pack. Accordingly, the present invention provides a calendar pack containing pharmaceutical formulations doses for use in treating female acne vulgaris comprising spaced locations corresponding to days of a menstrual cycle, dosage forms in a first series of said locations providing at the or each location of the series a daily dose of an anti androgen and a dose of antibiotic in pharmaceutically administerable form, and dosage forms at a further series of locations foll gate first series providing a daily dose of antibioti X phÅaluaceutically e lmini sterable form without anti androgen More preferably, the invention provides a calendar pack containing pharmaceutical formulation doses for use in treating female acne vulgaris, comprising spaced locations corresponding to days of a menstrual cycle, dosage forms in a first series of said locations providing at the or each location of the series a daily dose of cyproterone acetate and a daily dose of an oestrogen and a dose of antibiotic in pharmaceutically administerable form and dosage forms at a second series of locations following the first series providing a daily dose of the oestrogen and a dose of antibiotic in pharmaceutically administerable form without cyproterone acetate. Each dosage location may contain more than one dosage form. For instance, the location for day 1 may contain a formulation in accordance with the invention of cyproterone acetate, oestrogen and antibiotic in a single dosage form. Alternatively, the location for day 1 may contain a dosage form containing cyproterone acetate and oestrogen and a separate dosage from containing antibiotic. These dosage forms may be presented at the one days location, one e.g. form for each active ingredient. An example of a pack according to the invention would be a bubble pack of the conventional kind having a tablet or other dosage form contained in a bubble at each of a series of spaced locations, normally positioned in a closed loop running around the edge of the pack.The locations may be numbered, normally 1 to 28. A first series of bubbles or other destructible receptacles may contain either one tablet or other dosage form containing all three active ingredients or two or three tablets or other dosage forms, e.g. one containing oestrogen another cyproterone acetate and another antibiotic. Where more than one dosage form is provided they may of course be put in separate bubbles at the same day s location. The first series of locations will preferably correspond to up to the first 21 days e.g. from 7 to 10 days of a 28 day cycle. The second series of locations may then contain only one dosage form per location containing oestrogen and antibiotic but not cyproterone acetate. The second series may comprise enough locations to bring the user to from the 21st day of a cycle to the 28th day, preferably to about the 21st day. Further locations may be provided containing a dosage form containing antibiotic but neither of the other active ingredients. An example of a tablet formulation according to the present invention would for instance be 1. ethinyloestradiol 40pg 70mg lactose cyproterone acetate lOOmg 94mg corn starch lOmg talcum 3.2mg gelatin erythromycin 500mg 2.8mg magnesium stearate In order to suppress adrenal androgen production it may be desirable to administer a compound such as prednisolone or dexamethasone which acts as a suppressor for adrenal androgen production. Predisolone is best given in so called reverse rhythm, ie with a higher dose such as 5mg on retiring to suppress the normal early morning rise 3 to 5am of pituitary ACTH thereby diminishing early morning adrenal gland stimulation. A lesser dose such as 2.5mg taken on waking will then maintain suppression throughout the morning.Suitable dosages for prednisolone would generally be 3 to 15 mg on retiring and 1 to 5 mg on waking. If dexamethasone is used, a single dose of from 0.5 to 2 mg on retiring will generally suffice. Naturally, other adrenal androgen suppressors may be used. The adrenal androgen production suppressor may be included in the formulations according to the invention.It may be included in the calendar packs described above either as separate dosage forms or in combination with one or none of the other active materials. The calendar packs provided by the invehtion may provide dosages for each day split between two or more locations each location containing one or more dosage forms, so that the daily dose of the cyproterone acetate, oestrogen antibiotic and optionally suppressor may be split as desired for e.g. morning and night doses. Not all of the ingredients need be present in any one dose. Other agents known for use in the treatment of acne may be included in formulations according to the present invention. For instance, 13 cis retinoic acid may be included, suitably in amounts sufficient to provide a dose of about 2.0 mg per kg body weight of the patient to be treated. For instance, a preparation to be taken twice daily might contain from 50 to 80 mg of 13 cis retinoic acid. This compound appears to have a direct inhibitory effect cn sebum secretion. Also Zinc as Zinc Sulphate up to 250mg of elemental zinc daily in divided doses orally may be combined with the treatment.Other compounds used in the treatment of acne Which may be included are retinoic acid as Retin A or other retinoids Vitamin A or its derivatives or analogues or salicylic acid or its salts. Examples of topical preparations according to the invention are as follows 1 a. Clindamycin 0.5 5.0 Medroxyprogesterone Acetate 0.1 1.0 Oestradiol Benzoate 0.001 up to 1.0 Retinoic Acid 0.0125 0.4 Salicylic acid 0.1 5.0 1 b.Clindamycin 0.5 5.0 Medroxyprogesterone Acetate 0.1 1.0 Oestradiol Benzoate 0.0018 up to 1.0 Retinoic Acid 0.0125 0.4 1 c. Clinssamycin 0.5 5.0 Medroxyprogesterone Acetate 0.18 1.0 Oestradiol Benzoate 0.001 up to 1.0 1 d. Clindamycin 0.5 5.0t Medroxyprogesterone Acetate 0.1 1.0 1 e. Clindamycin 0.5 5.0 Medroxyprogesterone Acetate 0.1 1.0 Salicylic Acid 0.1 5.0 1 f. Clindamycin 0.58 5.0 Medroxyprogesterone Acetate 0.1 1.0 Salicylic Acid 0.1 5.0 Retinoic Acid 0.0125 0.4 or g. Any caribination of any two ingredients.It should be understood that any antibiotic generally suitable for treating acne may be used in a topical dose range 0.5 5.0 . Each of the above could be made up either as an ointment,. in which case the balance of each would be an ointment base such as unguentum Mercy , or as a lotion using an appropriate lotion base. Lotions are suitably applied to the entire affected area whilst creams may be applied to particularly large lesions to maintain contact through the day.Treatment may involve the simultaneous use of both oral and topical preparations according to the invention. Thus the treatment might suitably include the cyclical administration of oral preparations using calendar packs as described above and continuous use of a topical preparation.SYSTEMIC PREPARATIONSClinical Examples a Severe pustular cystic acne with extensive previous scarringTwo female patients aged 17 years and 26 years had a history of severe pustular and cystic acne of the face, chest and shoulders both for five years previously despite long term antibiotic therapy. In both patients there was evidence of extensive scarring of the tissues involved. Both patients had noted scalp hair loss and one had mild facial hirsuties and both had irregular periods prior to therapy. In order to effect resolution of the infected areas as rapidly as possible in these patients who were greatly distressed by their appearance, and to prevent further scarring treatment was begun with the following combination of drugs Daily therapy Prednisolone 5.Omg nocte 2.5mg maneDeteclo Chlortetracycline HC1 115.4mg Tetracycline HC1 115.4mg Demtclocycline HC1 69.2mg one nocte and mane.Cyclical therapy Ethinyl oestradiol 40ug mane daily for 25 daysCyproterone acetate 50mg mane and 50mg nocte for 21 daysFollowing the period the cyclical therapy was restarted.One patient continued this pattern of treatment for four months. The number of days per month of cyproterone acetate treatment was then reduced to 15 for 4 months and to 10 for the remaining period of treatment. The dosage of ethinyl oestradiol was reduced to 3Cug per day after nine months. The morning dose of prednisolone was stopped after five months and prednisolone treatment ended after seven months. In the other patient, the daily therapy was maintained for 10 months when the prednisolone was reduced to Smg nocte for three months and then stopped completely. After 12 months the Deteclo was changed to Erythromycin stearate 250mg mane and nocte. The cyclical therapy continued as above for four months when cyproterone acetate was reduced to 50mg mane and nocte for the first 15 days of the cycle ant then after a further eight months th s to 50mg mane and nocte for 10 days only. After three months of such treatment the cyproterone acetate was. stopped and the patient continued with ethinyl oestradiol 30ug daily for 21 days together with medroxyprogesterone acetate lOmg daily from days 16 21 of the cycle together with erythromycin 250mg mane and nocte only. Within six months the patient s acne had returned although not as severe as previously and therefore treatment with ethinyl oestradiol 40ug for 21 days together with cyproterone acetate 50mg twice daily for the first 7 days of each cycle was restarted. This resulted in complete clearing of the acne in two months. In both female patients the initial combination of cyclical anti androgen cyproterone acetate and ethinyl oestradiol and antibiotic therapy together with reverse rhythm prednisolone resulted in rapid improvement of the patients acne on the face, chest, shoulders and back with a substantial clearing within 6 to 8 weeks and complete resolution of the active lesions at five months and at 10 months. In both patients hair fall was reduced after 6 8 weeks with regrowth noticeable after 6 7 months. The patient with facial hirsuties noted an improvement after 7 months. In one patient at 12 months dermabrasion was carried out to the deeply scarred but now inactive areas, with good effect and continued cosmetic improvement over the subsequent six months. At thirty months of therapy the patient still retained clear skin.During therapy both patients noted regular but light withdrawal bleeds 4 7 days after stopping the ethinyl oestradiol. After 24 and 30 months cervical smears were normal and there were no significant changes in blood pressure and clinical examination was otherwise normal. Prior to therapy one patient was within the ideal range for weight 58.3kg ideal 49 59 while the other was below this 57.5kg ideal 62 69 . During treatment their maximum weights were 62.4 and 65.5kg respectively.b Severe pustular cystic acne with limited previous scarring Five female patients were in this group with involve ment of the face, chest, shoulders and back aged 16 30 years with a history of resistant acne for 3 15 years. The patients received the following treatment for 4 15 months. Daily therapy Deteclo one mane and one nocte or erythromycin stearate 250mg mane and nocte. Cyclical therapy Ethinyl oestradiol 40pg mane for 21 days Cyproterone acetate 50mg mane and nocte for the first ten days of the cycle. Treatment was restarted following the period . In all patients within four weeks there had been an improvement in the skin lesions. Within six months all patients had clearing of the lesions on the body and by 6 12 months complete resolution of the facial lesions. In the first 1 3 weeks two patients noted an increase in facial lesions. In one of them addi tional new lesions appeared over the front of the neck. In both patients complete resolution of these treatment induced lesions occured within 3 6 weeks on the same therapy. All patients experienced lighter periods beginning 4 7 days after stopping ethinyl oestradiol. Two patients noted an unwanted increase in body weight together with an increase in breast size. Their basal weights were 50kg ideal 47 53 and 49.9kg ideal 45 49 increasing to a maximum of 57kg at 7 months and 54kg at 6 months respectively. In both patients resolution of their skin lesions had resulted in a more cheerful disposition and increase in their food consumption as a result of an enhanced social life. One patient was started on Apt sate diethylpropion HC1 75mg, thiamine HC1 5mg, riboflavine 4mg, pyridoxine HC1 2mg, nicotinamide 30mg with successful appetite suppression and weight loss. The other patient despite an attempt to diet did not manage to lose weight. Two patients with hair loss noted a reduction in hair fall after 2 4 months of therapy and improved growth thereafter.c Moderate acne with minimal scarring One female patient 19 years with moderate facial acnenzithout scarring which had failed to respond to antibiotic therapy alone over one year was started on cyclical anti androgen treatment with erythromycin as in b with complete resolution within 3 months. Her weight remained unchanged. d Mild acne Two female patients with mild facial acne 17 and 20 years the latter with gross hirsuties of 1 7 years duration and resistant to antibiotic therapy alone were treated with cyclical anti androgen treatment and erythromycin as in b . There was complete resolution of the lesions within 1 2 months. After six months therapy in tUe hirsute patient there was a marked reduction in the rate of hair growth on the face and body with the replacement of coarse dark hairs with finer lighter coloured hairs. Neither patient had any significant change in weight or breast size.e Effect of reducing anti androgen dosage Initially, female patients were treated with Ethinyloestradiol 40ug daily for 21 days combined with Cyproterone Acetate lOOmg as 50mg twice daily for the first 10 days of each cycle combined with either Deteclo one b.d. or Erythromycin 250mg twice daily. Subsequently, as the acne has cleared the amount of Cyproterone Acetate was reduced. Patient No 1 Aged 20 years on starting treatment had been resistant to 1G of Erythromycin daily for a mini mum of one year before. Within 4 months the acne was completely cleared from the face. She continued with the full dosage for 2 years and then she continued with Ethinyloestradiol 40ug daily for 21 days of each cycle.Cyproterone Acetate 5Omg daily for the first 10 days of each cycle.Erythromycin 250mg b.d.She continued on the above treatment without the return of her acne for 2 months when the dose was reduced to Ethinyloestradiol 40ug daily for 21 days of each cycle,Cyproterone Acetate 25mg daily for the first 10 days of each cycle. Erythromycin 250mg b.d.Again she remained clear of acne so that one month later she continued with Ethinyloestradiol 40ug daily for 21 days of each cycle,Cyproterone Acetate 25mg alternate days over 10 days i.e. on S occasions equivalent to 125mug Erythromycin 250mg b.d. 2 months later the patient had the return of her first acne lesion, a small pustule to the left side of the chin, the first for approximately one year. Patient No 2 This patient was aged 30 years when she began with the following treatment Ethinyloestradiol 40ug daily for 21 days of each cycle. Cyproterone Acetate lO0mg daily for the first 10 days of each cycle. As 50mg b.d. Deteclo one tablet b.d. She continued on the above regimen with complete clearing of the pustular lesions and in particular hard painful lesions around the chin at 6 months such that after a further 2 months she continued with Ethinyloestradiol 40ug daily for 21 days of each cycle.Cyproterone Acetate 100 50mg alternate days over 10 days.Deteclo one tablet b.d.After 2 months she then continued with Ethinyloestradiol 40ug daily for 21 days of each cycle.Cyproterone Acetate 50mg daily for 10 days.Erythromycin 250mg b.d.The following month the patients skin was still com pletely clear, and so she continued with the same dose for a further five months. Then she continued with Ethinyloestradiol 40ug daily for 21 days of each cycle.Cypro erone Acetate 50mg daily for 7 days. Erythromycin 250mg b.d.On this her skin remained completely clear, and so after a further four months she continued with Ethinyloestradiol 40ug daily for 21 days of each cycle.Cyproterone Acetate 25mg daily for 7 days i.e.175mg per cycle .Erythromycin 250mg b.d.The next month she had her first acne lesion for approximately one year. The patient then continued with Ethinyloestradiol 40ug daily for 21 days of each cycle.Cyproterone Acetate 25mg alternate days of 4 occasions. i.e. lOOmg per cycle .Erythromycin 250mg b.d.Two months later there was worsening of the acne in that the previous hard painful lumps around the chin were beginning to return. The patient was asked to continue with Ethinyloestradiol 30ug daily for 21 days of each cycle.Cyproterone Acetate 25mg on alternate days on 3 occasions i.e. 75mg per cycle .Erythromycin 250mg b.d.When the patient was seen the following month the acne was clearly worsening and she noted that her hair was beginning to fall again as it was when she was first seen.From this study the following points emerge 1. Deteclo one b.d. or Erythromycin 250mg b.d.appear to be of equivalent effect. However, Erythromycin is preferable in view of the photosensitivity which may occur with Tetracyline contained in Deteclo.2. The first patient s acne had failed to clear withErythromycin 1G a day for the previous year. However, when this dose was reduced to 250mg b.d. 500mg per day and combined with Ethinyloestradiol and CyproteroneAcetate the acne cleared completely in 4 months. The addition of cyclical antiandrogen therapy therefore appears to allow the dose of antibiotics to be reduced and for a beneficial response to be seen with complete clearing of acne despite the reduced dose of antibiotics. By a synergistic action the inclusion of an antibiotic allows a lower dose of antiandrogen to be used which is highly desirable in clinical practice. 3. In both of the above patients as the total dose of Cyproterone Acetate per cycle was reduced to 125mug in the first patient and 175mg in the second patient the acne began to return. TOPICAL PREPARATIONS Clinical examples f A female patient aged 18 years had facial acne and also some lesions over the bade for the last 5 years beginning at puberty. The patient had not been without acne during this time despite various topical preparations being suggested to her or which she obtained herself from the pharmacy. The patients treatment regimen was as follows Wash face with a neutral soft soap, dry skin gently, and apply over all the lesions a lotion of formulation l a above with Clindamycin at 1.5 , Medroxyprogesterone Acetate at 0.1 , Oestradiol Benzoate at 0.1 , Retinoic Acid at 0.05 , Salicylic Acid at 0.1 . To individual, raised or painful lesions a cream was applied of formulation l c above with Clindamycin at 1.5 , Medroxyprogesterone Acetate at 0.1 and Oestradiol Benzoate at 0.1 in Ung Mere. The applications were carried out in the morning and in the evening and the amount used in each application was generally between 1 and 2 ml. At two weeks the lesions on the patient s back cleared and did not return although the topical applications were dis continued. The patient applied the lotion and cream initially to the right side of the face only. After 4 weeks there was some clearing on the right extending also across to the left side of the midline.At nine weeks there were no active lesions on the face nor back.During the 9 weeks that the patient had been using the applications to the face, there were no ill effects, the menstrual cycle was not disturbed and there was clear evidence of healing.Subsequently, on stopping the twice daily applications the patient s f t4n.d back remained clear for 4 weeks.After 5 weeks and 4 days without treatment, a few acne lesions began to appear around the chin and at the angles of the nose and on the forehead. These were in the central area previously affected, although at this time just discernible under the skin. At the same time the acne had clearly returned to the back and had been present for 2 days only. The patient therefore continued with the treatment as follows FORMULATION C 2 Times daily Clindamycin 1.5 Medroxyprogesterone Acetate 0.1E Oestradiol Benzoate 0.01 Salicylic acid 0.1 Retinoic Acid 0.05 was omitted from this preparation After one week the acne again began to clear and there were no active lesions remaining on the face.On the back, approximately 40 of the previous spots were healed completely. 30 were still active and the rest were of intermediate severity. During the following week the patient continued with FORMULATION S 3 Times daily Erythromycin 1.5 Medroxyprogesterone Acetate 0.5 Oestradiol Benzoate 0.02 Salicylic Acid 2 The patient continued with this for one week and all the remaining acne lesions on the face cleared. The back was clearing also with fading of the lesions.She then continued on FORMULATION S six times a day to the face and back. There was no peeling with this regimen and no undue dryness. The face remained comp letely clear and on the back the lesions were fading.The following week the patient continued on F0Q.MULATI0N S again six times daily. The face remained clear and the back continued to clear. The following week the patient started with FORMULATION P 3 Times dailyErythomycin 1.5 Progesterone 2.5 Oestradiol Benzoate 0.01 Salicylic Acid 3.0 The patients face was coMpletely clear. The back was continuining to clear with rapid fading now of the lesions.There was some peeling of the skin around the chin and on the back.The patient then continued for a week with FORMULATION PK 3 Times dailyErythromycin 0.75 Progesterone 1.25 Oestradiol Benzoate 0.0058 Salicylic Acid 1.5 Retinoic Acid 0.0125 The skin cn both face and back was now completely clear i.e. 8 weeks after re appearance of the acne. The patient continued to date using FORMULATION PK once per day with the skin of both face and back still completely clear. Topical preparations both Lotions and Creams according to the invention are also efective in the treatment of male acne.Clinical Examples g A male patient aged 20 years had severe pustular acne and greasy skin since the age of 13 14 years. Previously be used topical preparations fran the chemists, using items such asClearasil, also benzoyl peroxide, and Retin A, combined with oral tetracycline 500mg b.d. for five years. More recently he used benzoyl peroxide 5 gel together with two septrin tablets b.d.None of these medications was effective. All were stopped.He therefore started started using the topical preparations of the present invention as for female patients using the Lotion, ClindaEycin 1.5 , Medroxyprogesterone Acetate 0 1 , OestradiolBenzoate 0.1 , Retinoic Acid 0.05t, Salicylic Acid 0.1 for wide application the cream ClindaEycin 1.5 , Medroxy progesteroneAcetate 0.1 , Oestradiol Benzoate 0.1 to localised lesions, together with a neutral cream soap. He also used a polytar shaqpco and hair conditioner.The patient applied the Lotion and Cream to the right side of the face only for one week and then subsequently to both sides.After six weeks there had been a narked improvement in the skin in that the pustular lesions were actively resolving and the patient noted a rapid decrease within boors of the application in the tenderness previously associated with his lesions. The patient also had pustular acne over the back and shoulders and again at six weeks this was resolving. After 17 weeks of the original formulaticn he continued with a preparation cmitting the retinoic acid. The patient used this once per day only or on some instances only 3 4 times per week. After a total of 25 weeks of treatment, 8 weeks of treatment without retinoic acid his shoulders were completely clear and his face clearing still further, There were no significant changes in the haematology, biodhemistry or endocrine sperm count profiles nor in potency.h A male patient aged 18 years with severe cystic acne fran the age of 15 years affecting predkxçfaantly the back. He had received Tetracycline 1G per day or Septrin 2 tablets b.d. c combined with a variety of skin washes. Recently he had been receiving Erythromycin 1G per day together with Prednisolone and had returned front Bermuda where he had been sunbathing in an effort to produce resolution of his acne. This had been supplemented also in the previous year by ultra violet light from a sunbed cn a regular basis. It was clearly evident that these forms of treatment were ineffective.Therefore, he was started on the present topical preparations, Cream and Lotion as in the previous male patient, applied twice daily to the back. Within 12 weeks there had been a great improvement with a reduction in the number of active lesions. By 26 weeks there were no active lesions remaining on the back. The previously active pustules were replaced by pine blemishes in the process of healing. By the end of 26 weeks there had been no significant change in the haematology, biochemistry or endocrine sperm count profiles nor in potency. i A male patient aged 15 years had recurrent pustular acne with comedones present since the age of 12 years. Previously he had used topical preparations fran the Pharmacy without effect. He was started on the topical preparation, Lotion only, containing Formulation ST Clindamycin 1.5t Medroxyprogesterone Acetate 0.5 Oestradiol Benzoate 0.1 Retinoic Acid 0.2t Salicylic Acid 0.1 The patient applied the Lotion aver the complete face, forehead, chin and sides of face hich were affected by acne. After 3 weeks there was a great improvement in the patients acne with clear evidence of resolution and after 9 weeks the skin was clear of active lesions. The patient then continued to apply Formulation ST to the left side of the face only. After a further 5 weeks, acne again appeared an the right side of the chin with some lesions on the forehead. The left side of the face remained clear.The treatment was without side effects apart same dryness to the left nasal fold and left side of the nose after 14 weeks of continuous treatment. This dryness disappeared on using the preparation onoe daily without the return of the acne. The use of oral or other systemic modes of administration of anLi androgens will not be suitable for male patients in general because of undesired effects of the hormcsal constituent of the fcrmulations. However, there may be special cases in which such administration routes would benefit a male patient. The formulations, according to the invention should not include any active ingredients incompatible with the treatment of acne or intended for treatment of wholly different conditions. For the sake of illustration, the inclusion of, for instance, cytotoxic drugs, such as cytidine derivatives, would not be within the scope of the invention. A fornulation containing such drugs would nok be suitable for use in treating acne. Further clinical trials have established that the anission of the antibiotic from the formulations of the present invention results in incomplete clearing of the acne.
