# WEIGHING, PRICING, PRINTING AND LABELLING MACHINES

## Abstract
A combined weighing, pricing, printing and labelling machine 10 comprises a weighing station 15 through which a set 12 of belt conveyors traverse a package 20 to be weighed. Station 15 is formed by a weigh cell 13 preferably of the vibrating string type and conveyor 12C which is mounted over the cell 13 continuously traverses the package 20 through the station 15 so that at least one weight measurement is established by cell 13 during the transit of the package 20 through the station 15 . The weight measurement is delivered electrically to a computa tional facility 18 having an output which drives a label printer 17 which in turn delivers the printed label to a labeller 16 arranged to affix the printed label to the weighed package 20 at a labelling station through which the set 12 of conveyors move and which is downstream of the weighing station 15 . Associated with the weighing station 15 is a detector X₂ for providing a gating signal to the computational facility 18 when a package 20 is located in the station 15 . A further detector arrangement X₂, X₃ is provided in station 15 for inhibiting operation of the printer 17 and labeller 16 consequential to the pre sence of more than one package 20 simultaneously in said weighing station 15 . A still further detector X₁ is provided at the input end of the weighing station 15 for interrupting motion of the conveyors 12A, 12B which deliver the pack age 20 to the station 15 , this interruption being of a predetermined duration sufficient to permit transit of a package 20 through the station 15 prior to a subsequent package 20 being delivered to the station 15 for weighing.
