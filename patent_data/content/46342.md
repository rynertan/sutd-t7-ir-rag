# Detergent compositions and processes of making thereof.

## Abstract
Foam controlled detergent compositions comprising alkoxylated nonionic surfactant, polydimethylsiloxane foam controller dispersed therein, and siloxane oxyalky lene copolymer as dispersing agent therefor, the weight ratio of polydimethylsiloxane to dispersing agent lying in the range from 2 1 to 20 1. The compositions prefer ably also contain particulate silica in a weight ratio of polydimethylsiloxane to silica of from 20 1 to 200 1.
