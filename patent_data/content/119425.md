## Description
Brief Summary of the InventionTechnical Field This invention is directed in general to coating compositions and, in particular, to photocopolymerizable compositions comprising an epoxide containing two or more epoxy groups, a poly active hydrogen organic compound, a photoinitiator and, as a reactive diluent, a substituted cycloaliphatic monoepoxide.Background Art Governmental regulations have placed ever increasing restrictions on the amounts and types of organic volatiles permitted to escape into the atmosphere from coatings compositions. Considerable efforts have been expended to develop coatings compositions having a minimal amount of volatile organic components and this has led to development of radiation curable coatings, powder coatings, water borne coatings and high solids coatings. In these recent developments the amounts of organic solvents present are minimal and consequently there is little or no atmospheric pollution. In the field of radiation curable coatings, it is well known that coating compositions containing cycloaliphatic epoxides and hydroxyl containing materials can be radiation cured by the use of onium salts such as FC 508 available from the 3M Company and UVE 1014 available fromGeneral Electric Company. The onium salts form shelf stable forlnulatiols with cycloaliphatic epoxides and hydroxyl containing materials in an environment free of ultraviolet light irradiation.When such onium salts are irradiated with ultraviolet light, a cationic catalyst composition is formed that cures the formulation into a coating film with little or no organic volatiles escaping into the atmosphere. However, the cycloaliphatic epoxides used in the radiation curable coatings have a relatively high viscosity of about 300 to 500 centipoise or more. In addition, hydroxyl containing materials such as organic polyols are oftentimes blended with the cycloaliphatic epoxide to improve certain coating properties such as flexibility and toughness of the coating. When the organic polyols are of sufficient molecular weight to improve flexibility of the cured coatings, the viscosity of the blended formulations is oftentimes increased even further.The high viscosity of the blended formulations precludes the application thereof to a suitable substrate by conventional techniques such as roll coating, spray and other methods of application.Solvents in general can be used to reduce the viscosity of the curable blended formulations.However, the solvents must be volatilized at some point in the curing process and such volatilization will negate the atmospheric pollution control benefits of radiation curable coatings which are considered to be essentially 100 percent solids coating systems. Thus, radiation curable coatings such as the ones hereinafter described which exhibit desirably low viscosity and produce good satisfactory cured coating films, are of great importance. It has been found as a result of the present invention that certain substituted cycloaliphatic monoepoxides can be used as reactive diluents in photocopolymerizable coating compositions based on epoxy and hydroxyl containing organic materials to produce curable coating formulations having desirable low viscosity. Such curable coating formulations require little or no organic solvent to improve flowability during application thereof by conventional methods to a suitable surface or substrate. The cured coating films prepared from these low viscosity photocopolymerizable coating formulations also exhibit highly desirable film properties as described more fully hereinbelow.Disclosure of the Invention The present invention is directed to photocopolymerizable compositions comprising an epoxide containing two or more epoxy groups, a poly active hydrogen organic compound, a photoinitiator and, as a reactive diluent, a substituted cycloaliphatic monoepoxide. The invention is also directed to blend formulations comprising an epoxide containing two or more epoxy groups, a poly active hydrogen organic compound and a substituted cycloaliphatic monoepoxide. The above compositions can optionally contain a surfactant, filler, additives and an organic solvent where necessary.The photocopolymerizable compositions have desirably low viscosity and can be applied in a conventional manner such as roll coating, spray and the like and, after exposure to any source of radiation emitting actinic radiation at a wavelength within the ultraviolet and visible spectral regions, can be cured to dry coating films. The cured coating films are useful as automotive finishes, can finishes, appliance finishes, business machine finishes, coil coating, house siding, general metal finishes, adhesives, printing inks and the like. The invention is further directed to a process for preparing a cured film coating comprising 1 mixing until homogeneous a photocopolymerizable composition comprising an epoxide containing two or more epoxy groups, a poly ctive hydrogen organic compound, a substituted cycloaliphatic monoepoxide and a photoinitiator 2 applying the homogeneous photocopolymerizable composition as a film coating on a suitable surface or substrate and 3 exposing the film coating to actinic irradiation at a wavelength within the ultraviolet and visible spectral regions or electron beam irradiation for a period of time sufficient to cure the film coating.The cured film prepared by the above described process is also a part of this invention.

Cycloaliphatic epoxides suitable for use in preparing the polycaprolactone hexols include 3, 4 epoxycyclohexylmethyl 3, 4 epoxycyclohexane carboxylate, bis 3, 4 epoxycyclohexylmethyl adipate, vinyl cyclohexane dioxide and the like.Many of these cycloaliphatic epoxides are commercially available from Union CarbideCorporation. A suitable polymerization catalyst is diethylammonium triflate which is commercially available from the 3M Company as FC 520. A preferred method for preparation of the polycaprolactone hexols comprises adding one or more polycarpolactone triols to a reactor, heating the polycaprolactone triols to a temperature of about 1000C and adding the catalyst using a nitrogen sparge as soon as the polycaprolactone triols are molten. The polycaprolactone triols and catalyst mixture is then heated to a temperature of from about 1500C to about 2000C and a cycloaliphatic epoxide is added to the mixture. The reaction is carried out for about one hour to about three hours or until the oxirane content has been reduced to almost a nil value. A modification of this process can involve initially adding all of the ingredients into the reactor.A further modification of this method can involve a vacuum treatment of from 10 to 30 minutes after the catalyst addition and or the use of a vacuum during the heating of the polycaprolatone triols to a molten state. Preferred polycaprolactone hexols suitable as ingredients in the coating compositions of this invention have an average molecular weight of from about 600 to about 1500. Although not specifically mentioned above, it is appreciated that other lactone based polyols can be used in the coating compositions of this invention. Illustrative of other lactone based polyols include those derived from beta propiolactone, elta valerolactone, zeta enantholactone and the like including derivatives thereof such as gamma methyl delta valerolactone an the like. The polymer polyols that can be used to prepare the coating compositions of this invention are known materials. Such polymer polyols can be produced by polymerizing one or more ethylenically unsaturated monomers dissolved or dispersed in a base polyol in the presence of a free radical catalyst. The production of polymer polyols is more fully described in U.S. Patent Reissue 28,715, U.S.Patent Reissue 29,118, U.S. Patent 3,652,639, U.S.Patent Reissue 29,014, U.S. Patent 3,950,317, U.S.Patent 4,208,314, U.S. Patent 4,104,236, U.S. Patent 4,172,825 and U.S. Patent 4,198,488. While poly oxypropylene polyols are preferred, substantially any of the polyols previously used in the art to make polymer polyols can be used as the base polyol. Illustrative of the base polyols useful in producing polymer polyol compositions are the polyether polyols such as polyhydroxyalkanes and polyoxyalkylene polyols, or the like. Among the base polyols which can be employed are those selected from one or more of the following classes of compositions, alone or in admixture, known to those skilled in the art and described more fully hereinabove a Alkylene oxide adducts of polyhydroxyalkanes b Alkylene oxide adducts of non reducing sugars and sugar derivatives c Alkylene oxide adducts of phosphorus and polyphosphorus acids d Alkylene oxide adducts thereof of polyphenols e The polyols from natural oils such as castor oil, and the like.The most preferred base polyols employed in the polymer polyols which are useful as ingredients in the coating compositions of this invention include the poly oxypropylene polyols. It should be appreciated that a blend or mixture of more than one base polyol can be utilized, if desired, to form the polymer polyol. Conceptually, the monomers used in preparing the polymer polyols can comprise any ethylenically unsaturated monomer or monomers. A variety of monomers are disclosed in the patents relating to polymer polyols previously referred to.The selection of the monomer or monomers used will depend on considerations such as the relative cost of the monomers and the product characteristics required for the intended application. The preferred monomer and monomer mixture used to make the polymer portion of the polymer polyols is acrylonitrile and a mixture of acrylonitrile and styrene respectively. The relative weight proportions of acrylonitrile to styrene can range from about 80 20 to about 20 80.It may be desirable in some applications to utilize, with acrylonitrile, a comonomer other than styrene.Representative examples of suitable comonomers include methyl methacrylate, vinyl chloride and vinylidene chloride. The polymer and polyol content of the polymer polyols can vary within wide limits, depending upon the requirements of the anticipated end use application. In general, the polymer content will vary from about 10 to about 50 percent, based upon the weight of the polymer polyol. The polyol content of the polymer polyols varies from about 50 to about 90 percent, based upon the weight of the polymer polyol. The polymer polsols may, if desired, be blended with other conventional polyols described hereinabove to reduce the polymer content to the level desirable for the particular end use application. Blends in which the resulting polymer content is as low as 4 percent of the total weight of the blend or even less may be useful in the coating compositions of this invention. The most preferred classes of polyols employed in the coating compositions of this invention are the polycaprolatone polyols such asTONE 0200 and TONE 0305 commercially available fromUnion Carbide Corporation, the dihydroxyl functional polytetramethylene oxide polyols such as Polymeg 650, 1000 and 2000 commercially available fromQuaker Oats Company, the polymer polyols such asNIAX Polymer Polyol 31 23 and 34 28 commercially available from Union Carbide Corporation, and of course the ethylene oxide and propylene oxide adducts including ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, the poly oxyethylene glycols, the poly oxypropylene glycols, triols and higher functionality polyols such as LHT 67, LHT 112 andLG 56 commercially available from Union CarbideCorporation A preferred alkylene oxide derived polyol suitable for use in the coating compositions of this invention has the following formula EMI26.1 wherein Rlo is alkane of 3 to 10 carbon atoms, preferably 3 carbon atoms, and n is an integer of from about 10 to about 25 These polyols also include poly oxypropylene oxyethylene polyols however, desirably, the oxyethylene content should comprise less than 80 percent of the total and preferably less than 60 percent. The ethylene oxide when used can be incorporated in any fashion along the polymer chain.Stated another way, the ethylene oxide can be incorporated either in internal blocks, as terminal blocks, such as the propylene oxide polyols capped with ethylene oxide, i.e., NIAXPolyol 11 27 and 11 34 and E 474, commercially available from Union Carbide Corporation, or may be randomly distributed along the polymer chain. As is well known in the art, the polyols that are most preferred herein contain varying small amounts of unsaturation. Unsaturation in itself does not affect in any adverse way the formation of the coating compositions in accordance with the present invention. Other preferred representative examples of organic polyols that may be employed in the coating compositions of this invention include copolymers of hydroxypropyl and hydroxyethyl acrylates and methacrylates with other free radical polymerizable monomers such as acrylate esters, vinyl halides, vinyl acetate or styrene copolymers containing pendent hydroxy groups formed by hydrolysis or partial hydrolysis of vinyl acetate copolymers, polyvinylacetal resins containing pendent hydroxyl groups modified cellulose polymers such as hydroxyethylated and hydroxypropylated cellulose hydroxy terminated polyesters and hydroxy terminated polyalkadienes. The polyester polyols are the reaction products of polyfunctional organic carboxylic acids and polyhydric alcohols and include, for example, poly hexamethylene adipate , poly ethylene adipate , poly butylene adipate and the like. Many of these organic poZyols crn be prepared by conventional methods and are commercially available from a number of manufacturers such as polyvinylacetal resins commercially available from Monsanto ChemicalCompany as Butvar B 72A, B 73, B 76, B 90 and B 98 and as Formvar 7 70, 12 85, 7 95S, 7 9 SE, 15 9so and 15 95E an aliphatic polyester diol commercially available from Rohm and Haas as Paraplex U 148 saturated polyester polyols commercially available from Mobay Chemical Company as Multron R 2, R l2A, R 16, R 18, R 38, R 68, and R 74 a hydroxypropylated cellulose having an equivalent weight of approximately 100 commercially available from Hercules, Inc. as Klucel E and a cellulose acetate butyrate ester having a hydroxyl equivalent weight of approximately 400 commercially available from Eastman Kodak as Alcohol Soluble Butyrate. The poly active hydrogen organic compounds utilized in the coating compositions of this invention can be mixtures or blends of organic polyols. For example, when utilizing a polycaprolactone polyol, it may be desirable to mix or blend one or more of a propylene oxide polyol, a propylene oxide polyol capped with ethylene oxide, a polytetramethylene oxide polyol or a polymer polyol therewith. Other mixtures or blends may similarly be used if desired. The concentration of the organic polyols in the photocopolymerizable and blend compositions of this invention can range from about 1 to about 60 weight percent, preferably from 5 to 40 weight percent, and most preferably from 10 to 30 weight percent of the total weight of the coating composition.The ratio of the equivalent weight of epoxide to the total hydroxyl equivalent weight of organic polyol in the coating compositions of this invention can range from about 120 1 to 1 1, preferably from 110 1 to 2 1 and most preferably from 100 1 to 3 1 depending upon the equivalent weight of the polyol and the properties desired in the final coating composition. The blend compositions of this invention comprise an epoxide containing two or more epoxy groups, a poly active hydrogen organic compound and a substituted cycloaliphatic monoepoxide. A preferred blend composition of this invention comprises from about 40 to about 70 weight percent of 3, 4 epoxycyclohexylmethyl 3, 4 epoxy cyclohexane carboxylate, from about 1 to about 40 weight percent of a polycaprolactone triol and from about 5 to about 65 weight percent of 4 vinyl cyclohexene monoepoxide.Another preferred blend composition comprises from about 55 to about 85 weight percent of 3, 4 epoxycyclohexylmethyl 3, 4 epoxycyclohexane carboxylate, from about 10 to about 40 weight percent of a mixture of a polycaprolactone triol and at least one propylene oxide polyol, e.g., a mixture of TONE 0305, LHT 67 and LHT 112, and from about 5 to about 30 weight percent of 4 vinyl cyclohexene monoepoxide. The photoinitiator suitable for use in the coating compositions of this invention may be any one of the well known photoinitiators such as described in, for example, U.S. Patents 4,231,951 4,256,828 4,138,255 and 4,058,401, which patents are incorporated herein by reference. Preferred photoinitiators alone or in admixture include triarylsulfonium complex salts as described in U.S.Patent 4,231,951, aromatic sulfonium or iodonium salts of halogen containing complex ions as described in U.S. Patent 4,256,828 aromatic onium salts of Group VIa elements as described in U.S.Patents 4,058,401 and 4,138,255 aromatic onium salts of Group Va elements as described in U.S.Patent 4,069,055. Such salts are commercially available as FC 508 and FC 509 available fromMinnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company , and asUVE 1014 available from General Electric Company .Other preferred photoinitiators for use in the coating compositions of this invention are described more fully in copending U.S. Patent ApplicationSerial No. D 13814 , filed on an even date herewith. The photoinitiators are used in conventional amounts such as from about 0.1 to 30 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the combination of cycloaliphatic epoxide and the poly active nydrogen organic compound. The coating compositions may preferably include additives in conventional quantities such as oils, particularly silicone oil, surfactants such as silicone alkylene oxide copolymers, e.g., L 5410 commercially available from Union CarbideCorporation, silicone oil containing aliphatic epoxide groups, fluorocarbon surfactants such as FC 171 commercially available from the 3M Company and FC 430 also commercially available from the 3MCompany low molecular weight alcohols such as RJ 100 commercially available from Monsanto ChemicalCompany cellosolves, such as butyl CELLOSOLVE commercially available from Union CarbideCorporation carbitols, such as butyl CARBITOL diethyleneglycol low molecular weight hydroxyl containing vinyl polymers such as UCAR Solution Vinyl VYES commercially available fromUnion Carbide Corporation glycidyl ether monomers of the formula EMI31.1 wherein R11 is alkyl or aryl and n is an integer of 1 to 6. Examples are glycidyl ethers of polyhydric phenols obtained by reacting a polyhydric phenol with an excess of chlorohydrin such as epichlorohydrin. Further examples of this type are described in, for example, U.S. Patent 3,018,262 alpha olefin epoxides epoxy novolaks, and the like.If desired, one may also include in the coating compositions various conventional non basic fillers e.g., silica, talc, glass beads or bubbles, clays, powdered metal such as aluminum, zinc oxide, etc. up to about 508 by volume or more, viscosity modifiers, rubbers, tackifying agents, pigments, and so forth. The particular additives or fillers selected are of no consequence to the basic invention. In preparing the coating compositions, the ingredients are mixed by conventional procedures used in the production of inks, paints and coating compositions. These procedures are so well known to those skilled in the art that they do not require further discussion here. However, it should be noted that when the photoinitiator is incorporated into the coating compositions, it is necessary that the curable coating formulation be mixed or blended under wsafe light such as a yellow light source to obviate or minimize photocopolymerization. The coating compositions can also contain an organic solvent as an optional component. Any of the conventional solvents used in the coatings industry can be used at a concentration preferably below 30 weight percent of the total weight of the coating composition.Suitable solvents are acetone, methylene chloride and any solvent that does not react appreciably with the substituted cycloaliphatic monoepoxide, the epoxide containing two or more epoxy groups and the photoinitiator.While larger amounts of solvent could conceivably be used, the use of larger amounts would negate the benefits of radiation curable coating which are considered to be essentially 100 solids coating systems. The solvents are generally added in the small amounts indicated to improve flowability during application of the coating composition to the substrate. The curable coating compositions of this invention are applied to a suitable surface or substrate by conventional means such as roll coating or spray. Curing or photopolymerization of the coating compositions occurs on exposure of the compositions to any source of radiation emitting actinic radiation at a wavelength within the ultraviolet and visible spectral regions. Suitable sources of radiation include mercury, xenon, carbon arc and tungsten filament lamps, sunlight, etc.Exposures may be from less than about 1 second to 10 minutes or more depending upon the amounts of particular polymerizable materials and photoinitiators being utilized and depending upon the radiation source and distance from the source and the thickness of the coating to be cured. The compositions may also be polymerized by exposure to electron beam irradiation. Generally speaking the dosage necessary is from less than 1 megarad to 100 megarad or more. Generally speaking the rate of polymerization increases with increasing amounts of photoinitiator at a given light exposure or irradiation. The rate of polymerization also increases with increasing light intensity or electron dosage. The curing or photopolymerization of the coating compositions is a triggered reaction. Once the degradation of the photointiator to a cat ionic catalyst has begun by exposure to a radiation source, the curing or photopolymerization reaction proceeds and will continue after the radiation source is removed. The use of thermal energy during or after exposure to a radiation source, i.e., post cure thermally, will generally accelerate the curing reaction, and even a moderate increase in temperature may greatly accelerate cure rate. The photocopolymerizable compositions of this invention can be useful as automotive finishes, can finishes, appliance finishes, business machine finishes, coil coating, house siding finishes, general metal finishes and the like. The compositions can also be used as adhesives, printing inks, casting and molding compounds, potting and encapsulating compounds, caulking and sealing compounds, impregnating and coating compounds and the like. The photocopolymerizable compositions are particularly suitable in a variety of applications in the fields of protective coatings and graphic arts due to their superior impact resistance and abrasion resistance and adhesion to rigid, resilient and flexible substrates such as metal, plastic, rubber, glass, paper, wood, and ceramics. The coating compositions were evaluated according to the following procedures Solvent Resistance Double Acetone Rubs a measure of the resistance of the cured film to attack by acetone in which a film coating surface was rubbed with an acetone soaked cheesecloth back and forth with hand pressure. A rub back and forth with hand pressure over the film coating surface with the acetone soaked cheesecloth was designated as one double acetone rub . The effect that a certain number of double acetone rubs had on the film coating surface was reported by a number in parenthesis following the number of double acetone rubs. The rating system for evaluating acetone resistance for a given number of double acetone rubs was as follows Number in Parenthesis After Number of Rubs 1 No change in coating appearance. 2 Scratched surface. 3 Dulled, marred, some coating removed. 4 Breaks in coating appearance. 5 About one half of the coating removed. Pencil Hardness pencil leads of increasing hardness values were forced against the film coating surface in a precisely defined manner as described in AST D 3363 74 until one pencil lead marred the surface of the film coating. The surface hardness was considered as the hardest pencil grade which just failed to mar the film coating surface.The pencil leads in order of softest to hardest were reported as follows 6B, SB, 4B, 3B, 2B, B, HB, F,H, 2H, 3H, 4H, 5H, 6H, 7H, 8H, and 9H. Crosshatch Adhesion a lattice pattern with ten cuts in each direction was made in the coating film to the substrate and pressure sensitive adhesive tape was applied over the lattice pattern and then removed. The adhesion was evaluated by comparison with descriptions and illustrations as more fully detailed in ASTM D 3359 78. Forward Impact Resistance Gardner Impact a measure of the ability of a cured film coating to resist rupture from a falling weight. A GardnerImpact Tester Model IG 1l20 using an eight pound dart was used to test film coatings cast and cured on steel panels. The dart was raised to a given height in inches and dropped onto the coated side of the coated steel panel. The inches times pounds, designated inch pounds, absorbed by the film without rupturing was recorded as the films forward impact resistance. Reverse Impact Resistance Gardner Impact a measure of the ability of a cured film coating to resist rupture from a falling weight. A GardnerImpact Tester Model IG 1120 using an eight pound dart was used to test film coatings cast and cured on steel panels. The dart was raised to a given height in inches and dropped onto the uncoated side of the coated steel panel. The inches times pounds, designated inch pounds, absorbed by the film without rupturing was recorded as the films reverse impact resistance. Moisture Resistance the cured film coating was immersed in water for a specified period of time and at a specified temperature. After removal from the water, the hydrolytic resistance of tne cured film coating was determined by the pencil hardness test and the crosshatch adhesion test described hereinabove. Results obtained were compared with the results of identical tests performed on cured film coatings not immersed in water to determine moisture resistance.
