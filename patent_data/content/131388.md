# Fused cast high chrome refractory and production thereof.

## Abstract
A fused ceramic composition characterised in that it comprises a solidified fusion of from 65 to 98 weight percent Cr₂O₃, from 0.75 to 4 weight percent MgO and from 1 to 34.25 weight percent alumina is disclosed. A process for the production thereof which comprises fusing the components in a furnace and then slowly cooling the resulting composition is also disclosed. The present fused cast ceramic composition has superior corrosion and stoning resistance in the presence of E glass when compared with prior art compositions having compar able chromia content.
