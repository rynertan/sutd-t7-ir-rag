# COATING APPARATUS

## Abstract
Electrostatic or electrogasdynamic coating apparatus includes a coating gun, e.g. for use with dry powder, whose structure defines a through passage leading from an inlet tube 10 operatively connected to a source of particulate coating material to a discharge barrel 12 . A central needle cathode electrode 15 is mounted in a constricted region of the passage, its tip being adjacent an annular porous metal anode electrode 25 whose central opening defines part of the passage. A flow of the material is induced along the passage by a first pressurized gas e.g. air stream fed from a first supply formation 24 to enter the passage in the region of the electrodes, in which region the particles receive an electric charge from the latter. At the same time a second pressurized gas steam, which is controlled independently of the first stream, is fed from a second supply formation 24 through the porous electrode itself to prevent build up of particles on the acting portion thereof.
