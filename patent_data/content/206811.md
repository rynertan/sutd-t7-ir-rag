# Microwave container.

## Abstract
A container for heating material in a microwave oven, said container comprising a metal, for example aluminium, foil tray 100 having a bottom 102 and sides 104 . Bottom 102 is formed with two rectangular apertures 106 and 108 . The container lid 110 is formed of microwave transparent material and has two metallic, for example aluminium, plates 112 and 114 located thereon. The plates 112 and 114 are located in registry with the apertures 106 and 108 respectively. Each of the apertures 106 and 108 and plates 112 and 114 are operable to generate a microwave field pattern having a higher order than that of the container, said field pattern propagating into the container to heat the material. This is achieved in the arrangement illustrated by amplifying the 2nd order mode within the container which has been found to give improved heat distribution within the material being heated. Several other alternative arrangements are possible, some of which are illustrated in the specification.
