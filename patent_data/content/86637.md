# Treatment of molten materials.

## Abstract
The invention concerns the promotion of stirring of molten material eg. steel within a receptacle 1 such as a mould, vessel or shell of a partially solidified metal strand emerging from a mould. Polyphase alternating currents are passed through electrically conductive elements 3 located on, or forming part of, or lying adjacent to the receptable surface by joining both current connections of one or more transducers 2 to the conductive elements to cause electrical currents to flow along paths in the elements to induce magnetic fields within the molten material and to promote stirring of the ma terial.
