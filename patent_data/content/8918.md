# Production of loop chenille type yarn.

## Abstract
Apparatus and method for making loop chenille type yarns comprising elongated spindle having a tapered needle surfce 32 at one end thereof, the spindle 30 having a pas sage therein in communication with the needle surface for feeding a core thread 48 to the needle surface. Effect thread 60 is overfed to the needle location where nose piece member cooperating with the needle aids in wrapping the effect thread about the needle to form loops. The binder yarn 68 is fed to the needle 32a and twisted about the core and effect threads 60 . In a preferred embodiment, means 94, 86, 90, 88 are provided for reciprocating the nose piece rela tive to the needle between effect thread loop forming and effect thread non loop forming dispositions. In this manner, thick and thin novelty yarns are provided in which the thick sections of the yarn comprise looped effect threads whereas the loops are not provided in the thin yarn sections. Means may also be provided for twisting the effect thread about the binder and core threads. Further, by utiliza tion of a novel lateral feed of the effect thread with respect to the needle surface, the effect thread is not twisted about the core thread, but rather is disposed in side by side adjacent relationship to the core with the binder being twisted about the core and effect thread.
