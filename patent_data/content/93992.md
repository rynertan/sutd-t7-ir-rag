# Shielded connector and method of forming same.

## Abstract
A shielded connector 10 for a shielded electrical cable 20 which reduces radio frequency and other electromag netic interference. The shielded connector 10 comprises a pair of opposed, interconnected shield members enclos ing insulated conductors extending from the cable and a unitary outer housing enclosing the shield members 14, 15 . The shield members 14, 15 are electrically connected and bonded at opposite ends to a metallic connector hous ing 17 and a shield layer 24 extending from the cable 20 . Adhesive is interposed between the outer housing 12 and the shield members 14, 15 and cable 20 . The shield members 14, 15 have neck portions 31 that are connected to the shield layer 24 in the cable.
