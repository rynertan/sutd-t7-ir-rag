# Apparatus for testing integrated circuits.

## Abstract
A system for statically and dynamically testing an inte grated circuit die in wafer form at various temperatures includes a multilayer support fixture 10 in which the probes 50, the static test switching circuitry, and the dynamic test switching circuitry are mounted on separate, spaced apart, planar layers detachably connected to one another, the probe 50 and the probe support board 40 being formed of material having a low temperature coefficient of thermal expansion. A heated cooled wafer positioning chuck 12 controls the temp erature of the wafer 14 thereon during static and dynamic testing.
