# Fluid flow transducer.

## Abstract
A high pressure hydraulic fluid flow transducer 10 has a frusto conical throat 13 obturated by a valve member 14 which is fixed to a spindle 16 slidingly carried in a bearing 17 which is fixed to the one piece housing 11 . The bearing 17 engages a substantial length of the spindle, to prevent wobbling, closely adjacent the smaller throat end 15 . The housing 11 has internal screw threads 21, 22 at both ends, for connecting the sensor into an hydraulic system. Because the compression spring 18 is upstream of the valve member 14 , and acts upon the upstream end 25 of spindle 16 , the valve member 14 and throat 13 are both readily accessible through the downstream end of the housing, both for inspection purposes and for machin ing of the throat before insertion of the valve member and spindle. Reverse fluid flow is possible by virtue of a second spring 29 , acting between valve member 14 and spindle 16 .
