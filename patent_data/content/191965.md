# Centrifugal separator.

## Abstract
In a separator, a basket 7 is rotatably mounted on a drive shaft 5 within a cylindrical casing 1 closed by a lid 3 . At its bottom the basket has a central recess 12 in which a vertical discharge pipe 24 terminates. A scraper blade 23 is mounted on a rotatable drive shaft 22 from the open top of this basket. In use the basket is lined with a filter and is rotated, a solid liquid mixture e.g. for making a pharmaceutical is fed in through a supply pipe 20 through the open top of the basket liquid is flung out of holes 16 in the side of the basket and is drawn off from a peripheral guide 17 which slopes to an outlet 18 liquid in the central recess 12 is flung out due to the slanting sides of the recess. The solids form a layer see Fig. 4A on the basket side a which is periodically removed by slowing the speed of the basket and turning the scraper blade to the position shown in Fig. 1 and by lowering its shaft 22 to scrape the solids into the central recess where it is sucked by vacuum through the discharge pipe 24, the bottom of which may slant so as to almost touch the bottom of the recess. The basket may alternatively Fig. 6 be imperforate and liquid is removed through a skimming pipe.
