# Navigation system.

## Abstract
Apparatus for determining the position and velocity of a vehicle over a given area as represented by stored data includes a radar terrain sensor 10 responding to radar pulse returns and generating video signals to a terrain clearance estimator 16 . Also input to the terrain clearance estimator are vehicle vertical position data and vertical speed data which along with the video output of the terrain sensor generates by means of a time of arrival estimator observed clearance signals which are sampled and input to a buffer 24 . Also stored in the buffer are vehicle position and velocity signals from an inertial navigation system 18 with the buffer data accessed by an error correction estimator 30 . The error correction estimator responds to stored data to generate a sequence of position and velocity error correction signals each comprising three components. These error correction estimates of vehicle position and vehicle velocity are input to a data register 32 which is accessed by the inertial navigation system to provide update information on the position and velocity of a vehicle.
