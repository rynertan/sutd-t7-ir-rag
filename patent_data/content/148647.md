# A paper making method and a combination of ingredients to be used in it.

## Abstract
The retention properties of an aqueous cellulose fibre pulp and the bonding of the sheet prepared by a paper making meth od from this pulp within a pH range of 4 8 are improved by adding to the pulp, either together or separately, an organic natural or synthetic polymer and a Ti, Zr, Sn or B compound as inorganic oligomer or as a compound which in an aqueous liquid hydrolyses to form such an oligomer.
