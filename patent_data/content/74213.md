# Non volatile semiconductor memory circuits.

## Abstract
Memory circuits having a floating gate transistor as a non volatile storage element are constructed with a shunt transistor across the floating gate transistor which in the event of a short circuit between the floating gate and the transistor substrate causes the memory to go into a predeter mined fail safe condition. The circuits are cross coupled flip flops with a driver and a complementary driver or load connected in series in each of the circuits, one driver or complementary driver or load being a floating gate transistor such as a FATMOS. Short circuiting of the floating gate to the control gate of the floating gate transistor gives the same fail safe condition.
