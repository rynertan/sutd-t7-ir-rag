# Lock mechanism for webbing retractor.

## Abstract
A lock mechanism for a webbing retractor is designed to prevent unwinding of an occupant restraining webbing for a vehicle when an emergency situation of the vehicle occurs. The lock mechanism has a lock wheel adapted to rotate by means of biasing force in unison with the rotation of a webbing take up shaft in a direction in which the webbing is unwound, and a pawl lever activated by the action of an accel eration sensor to engage with the lock wheel, thereby causing the rotation of the lock wheel to be delayed with respect to the rotation of the take up shaft, and thus stopping the take up shaft from rotating in the webbing unwinding direction. The lock mechanism further has a leaf spring member adapted to receive the rotational force from the take up shaft through friction at three points and limit the action of the pawl lever when the take up shaft rotates in a direction in which the webbing is wound up. Accordingly, when the vehicle is running on a rough road, the webbing is prevented from being gradually wound up onto the take up shaft.
