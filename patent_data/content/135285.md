# Improvements relating to seals.

## Abstract
A sealing assembly comprises three non compressible and relatively movable members, the first and second members 3,2 having a first elastomeric sealing element 5 located between them, the second 2 and third members 1 having a second elastomeric element 6 located between them to urge the second member away from the third member and towards the first member. Spaces are provided between the second and third members and are occupied by an elastomeric spring 8 biassed to urge the second member away from the first member and a metallic spring 7 biassed to urge the second member towards the first member. The force exerted by the elastomeric spring is greater than and opposite to that exerted by the metallic spring.
