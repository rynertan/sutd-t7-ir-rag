# Process of preparing instant, flaked, wheat farina.

## Abstract
Process of preparing a dry, instant, wheat or farina like product in flake form which will readily rehydrate upon the addition of hot water. Farina and an effective amount of guar gum in powder form are admixed. The homogeneous mixture is impregnated with a sufficient amount of water to saturate the mixture. The mixture is tempered, preferably with agitation, to produce a material having uniform mois ture. The tempered material is cooked, the average particle size of the cooked material being increased thereby. The average particle size of the cooked material is then reduced. The particulate, cooked material is dried. The dry, particulate material is then tempered to provide a uniform moisture content. The tempered, particulate material is flaked to form a dry product in flake form, which is capable of being readily rehydrated by the addition thereto of hot water to provide a food product having the texture, etc., of cooked farina.
