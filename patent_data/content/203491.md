## Description
The present invention relates to a bistable circuit, and more particularly to a bistable circuit capable of stably operating even if a data signal is out of time with a clock signal. Bistable circuits alternatively assume two stable conditions in response to two inputs. Namely, if a signal is applied to a first input, the bistable circuit is brought into a first stable condition until a signal is applied to a second input. The two stable conditions of the bistable circuits can be regarded to correspond to binary information 0 and 1 , respectively. Therefore, the bistable circuits have been used in various digital circuits such as counters, shift registers, and the likes. These bistable circuits are mainly divided into two types, i.e., the asynchronous type and the synchronous type. In the asynchronous bistable circuits, the application of an input signal triggers the bistable circuit immediately. On the other hand, in the synchronous type, changes of state will occur only at selected times, i.e., when or after a clock signal is applied. In the case of a plurality of asynchronous bistable circuits being used, uncontrolled delays are inevitable, although individually very small typically of the order of a few nanoseconds , and these delays will introduce differential delays between signals that must travel through different numbers of logic circuits. Unwanted signal combinations may therefore appear for short periods and may be interpreted erroneously. The synchronous bistable circuits do not suffer from such a problem, because they conform to the control signals only when the clock signal is present. Therefore, the synchronous bistable circuits are widely used in logical circuits. However, the synchroneous bistable circuits involve another problem in which the outputs take an intermediate potential when the transistion of a data signal encounters the transition of a clock signal. If such an intermediate potential is outputted to the next bistable circuit, the state of the next circuit is not determined, which would result in malfunction of a circuit including the bistable circuits. EP A 0 058 752 discloses a clock synchronized master slave flip flop, wherein both outputs of the master flip flop are forcibly brought into a low level condition in case the master flip flop outputs an intermediate level so that the condition of the slave flip flop is maintained. For this purpose, there is provided a Schmitt trigger circuit for detecting said both outputs of the master flip flop are at the intermediate level and for outputting the result of the detection of the master flip flop. US A 4 179 628 discloses a circuit which offers a preference to a resetting in an asynchronous bistable circuit having a set terminal and reset terminal. It is an object of the invention to provide a bistable circuit capable of stably operating even if a data signal is inputted in asynchronous with a clock signal. Another object of the present invention is to provide a bistable circuit which can output a logically clearly distinguishable voltage signal so that a circuit connected to the bistable circuit will not malfunction even if the transistion of the input signal to the bistable circuit encounters the transition of a clock signal applied to the same bistable circuit. This object is achieved by a bistable circuit as defined in claim 1 dependent claims are related to further developments of the invention. Specifically, the lock circuit includes first and second insulated gate field effect transistors series connected between the first output of the flip flop and the predetermined supply voltage. The first transistor has a gate connected to receive the signal indicative of the condition of the second output of the flip flop, and the second transistor has a gate connected to receive the control signal. If a data signal is applied to the flip flop in asynchronism with a clock signal, more specifically if the transition of the inputted data signal encounters the transition of the applied clock signal, the first and second outputs of the flip flop will assume intermediate voltage conditions, respectively. With the arrangement mentioned above, however, the intermediate voltage in the predetermined one of the two outputs is applied to the first control input of the lock circuit, and then, in response to the control signal applied to the second control input, the lock circuit is rendered conductive so as to short circuit the first output of the flip flop to the predetermined supply voltage. As a result, the first output of the flip flop is brought into the predetermined supply voltage. Namely, the flip flop is forcedly caused to assume one stable condition. Therefore, the next circuit connected to the output of the flip flop will receive the output of a logically clearly distinguishable voltage, and so, can stably operate without malfunction. In one embodiments, the gate of the first transistor is directly connected to the second output of the flip flop. Further, the predetermined supply voltage is a source supply voltage, and the first and second transistors are n channel transistors, respectively. In a cascade of bistable circuits, the first and second outputs of the flip flop are respectively connected to a pair of inputs of a second flip flop having a clock input, and the gate of the second transistor are connected to the clock input of the second flip flop. In another embodiments, the predetermined supply voltage is a drain supply voltage and the first and second transistors are p channel transistors, respectively. Further, the gate of the second transistor is directly connected to the clock input of the flip flop itself. In a third embodiment, the lock circuit further includes a third insulated gate field effect transistor having a gate connected to the second output of the flip flop and a source connected to the predetermined supply voltage, a fourth insulated gate field effect transistor having a gate connected to the first output of the flip flop and a drain connected to a second supply voltage, and an inverter having an input connected to the drain of the third transistor and the source of the fourth transistor. The output of the inverter is connected to the gate of the first transistor. More specifically, the first predetermined supply voltage is a source supply voltage and the second supply voltage is a drain supply voltage. Further, the first to fourth transistors are n channel transistors, respectively. The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following description of preferred embodiments of the invention with reference to the accompanying drawings. Referring to Figure 1, there is shown a bistable circuit embodying the present invention. The shown bistable circuit comprises a flip flop FF I which includes a three input AND circuit 1 having an output connected to one input of a NOR circuit 2. The flip flop FF I also includes a two input AND circuit 3 whose output is connected to one input of another NOR circuit 4. This second NOR circuit 4 has another input connected to the output of the first NOR circuit 2, and an output connected to a second input of the first NOR circuit 2. With the above arrangement, two inputs of the three input AND circuit 1 and one input of the two input AND circuit 3 constitute data inputs A, B and C, respectively, and the remaining inputs of the AND circuits 1 and 3 are commonly connected to form a clock input F₁. The input A is adapted to receive a signal in asynchronism with the clock signal F₁, and the inputs B and C are adapted to receive either the same signal of logical level 0 or a pair of signals in reverse to each other, i.e., the signals 0 and 1 or the signals 1 or 0 , respectively. The outputs of the two NOR circuits 2 and 4 constitute two outputs Q and The flip flops mentioned above are well known in the art. In accordance with the present invention, furthermore, a n channel insulated gate field effect transistor Q₁ is connected at its drain to the output In the cascade of flip flops as explained above, assume now that as shown in Figure 2 the inputs B and C are a high voltage and a low voltage, respectively, and the signal applied to the input A varies in asynchronism with the clock input F₁.

In the circuit shown in Figure 3, the output Q of a flip flop FF IA is connected to a transfer gate 6 and a source of a p channel insulated gate field effect transistor Q₁₁ whose gate is connected to the output The circuit shown in Figure 3 operates as follows. As shown in Figure 4, under the condition that the input B is kept at a high level and the input C is a low level, when the clock pulse pulse F₁₁ falls down from a high level to a low level, if the input A rises up from a low level to a high level, the outputs Q and In the circuit as shown in Figure 3, if the transition of the input A is separated from the transition of the control signal F₁₁, the flip flop FF IA will operate in a similar manner to conventional ones, and do not suffer any adverse effect from the transistors Q₁₁ and Q₂₂ because either the transistor Q₁₁ or Q₂₂ is put in an off condition. Referring to Figure 5, there is shown a third embodiment of the bistable circuit in accordance with the present invention, in which the elements similar to those shown in Figure 1 are given the same reference numerals and explanation thereon will be omitted.
