## Description
Automatic dishwashing machine for domestic use with means for producing an oxidising solution of sodium hypochlorite The present invention relates to an automatic dishwashing machine for domestic use comprising a washing space, a container for salt NaCl , a water reservoir connectable to a water supply, and a cell for the electrochemical production of sodium hypochlorite NaClO , which cell is hydraulically connected both to the water reservoir via the salt container and to the washing space.Italian patent application No. 24213 A 83 of 16.12.83 in the name of the present applicants describes an automatic laundry washing machine of a similar construction, in which the water reservoir and the electrochemical cell are also hydraulically connected to one another by a further hydraulic connection through which the cell can be filled with water to a predetermined level which determined by level determining means. However, it is known that the problems relating to dishwashing machines are in certain respects different from those of laundry washing machines, so that it is not always possible to apply methods which are designed and valid for one type of machine to the other. The main object of the present invention is to provide a dishwashing machine in which the teachings deriving from the aforesaid Italian patent application are adapted to the different context to which they are required to apply. According to the present invention there is provided an automatic dishwashing machine for domestic use comprising a washing space, a container for sodium chloride, a water reservoir connectable to a water supply, and a cell for the electrochemical production of sodium hypochlorite, which cell is hydraulically connected to the washing space and is hydraulically connected to the water reservoir via the salt container, the electrochemical cell also being connected to the water reservoir by a further hydraulic connection through which the cell can be filled with water to a predetermined level which is determined by level determining means, characterized in that said water reservoir is in permanent communication with the salt container whereas said further hydraulic connection is connected by valve means. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the water is fed into the water reservoir by way of an air gap which, together with a valve located downstream of the air gap, is interposed in a conduit through which water from the water supply can flow to an ion exchanger provided for softening the water. The electrochemical cell may be hydraulically connected to the washing space by way of an ejector, of which the drive fluid is constituted by water from the water supply which has passed through the ion exchanger. The invention will be more apparent from the detailed description of a preferred embodiment given hereinafter by way of non limiting example with reference to the accompanying drawing, in which Figure 1 is a diagrammatic illustration of a dishwashing machine according to the invention Figure 2 is a sectional view of a modification of this machine, the modification comprising an ejector by means of which the sodium hypochlorite solution is fed into the washing environment by the water used in the wash cycle itself. In Figure 1 the reference numeral 101 indicates generally the housing of a dishwashing machine, which defines a conventional washing space 104 closed by a door, not shown. The bottom of the washing environment is conventionally connected to a discharge pipe 107 by way of a filter 102 and drainage pump 106. Arranged inside the housing 101, but shown outside the housing for reasons of clarity, are a water reservoir 117 which is disposed in a collection receptacle 127 connected at its bottom to the washing space 104 by a connection 128 an electrochemical cell 120 provided with electrodes 121, 121A which can be connected to a direct current electricity source a container 110 for the salt NaCl a container 115 containing an ion exchange resin, the purpose of which is to soften the water used in at least one of the wash programme stages and a timer, not shown, for controlling the various wash programme stages. At its bottom the water reservoir 117 is in permanent communication through a conduit 116 with the salt container 110, which is disposed at a lower level than the water reservoir. In addition, at a predetermined height above its bottom, the reservoir 117 is connected to the electrochemical cell 120 by an overflow conduit 131 in which is incorporated a solenoid valve EV2 B controlled by the timer. The cell 120 also is disposed at a lower level than the water reservoir 117. The electrochemical cell 120, which in the embodiment of Figure 1 is situated at a level higher than the highest level K reached by the water in the washing space 104, is connected at its bottom to the bottom of the washing space 104 by a conduit 129 in which is incorporated a solenoid va ve EV4 controlled by the timer. In addition, at a predetermined height above its bottom, the cell 120 is connected to the filter 102 by an overflow conduit 122. Finally, the cell 120 is connected to the salt container 110 by a conduit 150 in which is incorporated a solenoid valve EV3 controlled by the timer. The container 110 is also connected to the ion exchange resin container 115 by a conduit 151 in which is incorporated a solenoid valve EV5 controlled by the timer.The container 115 is connected at its bottom to the washing space 104 by a conduit 137 and at its top to the water main 103 by a conduit 133 in which the following are arranged in succession in the downstream direction a solenoid valveEV1 controlled by the timer an air gap 140 situated di rectly above the water reservoir 117, and a solenoid valve EV2 A controlled by the timer. In the modification of Figure 2, which can be used when part or all of the electrochemical cell 120 has to be located at a level lower than the level K in the washing space 104, an ejector 180 is incorporated in the conduit 137, and the conduit 129 opens into the ejector throat so that when water flows through the conduit 137 to the washing space, a suction is created in the conduit 129 which draws liquid from the cell 120 to mix with the water before reaching the space 104. The operation is as follows. At the commencement of the wash cycle, the washing space 104, the cell 120 which is usually positioned above the highest level K in the washing space 104 and the reservoir 117 are open.NaCl, various calcium salts and other substances are present in the resin container 115. The timer opens only the solenoid valves EVI and EV2 A, all the others remaining closed, and starts the drainage pump 106. The mains water is drawn through the container 115, ashes the resins contained therein and is discharged through the pipe 107. The timer stops the pump 106 after a given time when discharge is complete. On termination of this first stage, the timer keeps the solenoid valve EV1 open, closes valve EV2 A, opens valve EV2 B and keeps valves EV3, EV4 and EV5 closed. The mains water, fed through valveEV1, cannot pass through valve EV2 A which is closed and therefore falls from the air gap into the reservoir 117, which starts to fill up. When the water level in the reservoir 117 reaches the height of the overflow conduit 131 the water, which continues to flow into the reservoir since valve EV1 is still open, discharges through the valve EV2 B into the cell 120. When the water reaches the inlet of the overflow conduit 122 it flows through this conduit to the bottom of the washing space 104 and effects a certain cleaning of the water filters 102.Af ter a predetermined time, the timer closes valve EV1 and starts the drainage pump 106 in order to discharge all the water. In the meantime, the water level in the reservoir 117 stabilises at the level of the inlet to the overflow conduit 131. The timer then stops the pump 106. The timer then opens the solenoid valves EV2 A and EV3 and keeps the solenoid valves EV1, EV2 B, EV4 and EV5 closed. Water flows from the bottom of the reservoir 117 along the conduit 116 and enters the salt container 110 to cause the brine therein to enter the cell 120 through the valve EV3. This thus effects automatic dispensing of the brine to be electrolysed in the cell 120. When dispensing is complete, the timer closes the valve EV3 and supplies electricity to the electrodes of the cell 120, which then begins to produce the sodium hypochlorite by electrolysis. The dishes are then washed in the conventional manner, if desired after a prewash with cold water.The wash water is fed to the washing space 104 through the valve EV1 which is open in this stage , the air gap 140, the conduit 133, the valve EV2 A now open , the resin container 115 where it is softened and the conduit 137. Some of the water falls from the air gap 140into the reservoir 117, which is filled to the top. Water does not flow from the conduit 131 because the timer keeps the valve EV2 B closed. The excess water falls from the reservoir 117 directly into the washing environment 104 via the receptacle 127 and the connection 128 which can be a simple aperture . When electrolysis is finished, the timer disconnects the direct current supply from the electrodes 121 of the cell 120. The sodium hypochlorite can be used in two possible ways. In all cases it can be used either during the actual washing of the dishes or in one of the first two rinsing stages of the three generally provided . In the first alternative, the water is fed into the washing space 104 as hereinbefore described, and then when the timer opens the valve EV4 the siduum hypochlorite is fed from the cell 120 into the washing space 104 along the conduit 129. In the second alternative, instead of separately entering the washing space 104, the conduits 129, 137 see Figure 2 meet at the ejector 180.When the valve EV4 is opened, a pre mixing takes place between the water arriving from the resin container 115 by way of the conduit 137 and the sodium hypochlorite arriving from the cell 120 by way of the valve EV4 and conduit 129 . This mixture then enters the washing space 104. With respect to the first alternative the second has the advantage that the cell 120 could be positioned below the washing space 104, i.e., in a zone which creates fewer constructional problems if the present invention is used on an existing dishwashing machine. The rinsing stage or stages which follow the use of the sodium hypochlorite are carried out in an entirely conventional manner. The last stage of the dishwashing cycle consists of regenerating the resins contained in 115. For this, the timer keeps all the solenoid valves closed except valve EV5. Consequently, the reservoir 117 empties of water, which is discharged through the conduit 116 and into the salt container 110 to cause the brine therein to enter the resin container 115 through the valve EV5 and conduit 151. The water which occupied the container 115 is thus transferred to the washing space 104 along the conduit 137. After a certain time the timer operates the pump 106 in order to empty the machine.
