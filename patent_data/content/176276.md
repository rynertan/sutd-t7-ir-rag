# A MULTIPLE SPEED SCANNER SERVO SYSTEM FOR PROTECTING THE HEADS AND TAPE OF HELICAL RECORDERS

## Abstract
A multiple speed servo is provided which measures and controls the speed of a head scanner 14 below approxi mately 900 rpm, to maintain a preselected, relatively re duced, scanner speed which is fast enough to aid threading and unthreading tape about the scanner in the reverse direction, but not fast enough to damage the heads or tape. The safe handling is enhanced by selectively reducing the tape speed during reverse threading and unthreading of the tape, to maintain a preferred ratio of scanner circumferential velocity equal to, or slightly greater than, the tape speed. To this end. a slow speed scanner servo 30, 34 is employed to continually monitor and maintain the scanner at the pre selected reduced scanner speed while the tape is maintained at the associated reduced tape speed.
