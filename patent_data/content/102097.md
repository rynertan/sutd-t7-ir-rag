# Process for oxidising vinylbenzene compounds to beta phenylaldehydes.

## Abstract
A process for oxidising vinylbenzene compounds, con sisting of reacting said compounds with an aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide in the presence of synthetic zeolites containing titanium atoms, of general formula xTiO₂. 1 x SiO₂ where x lies between 0.0001 and 0.04, and possibly in the presence of one or more solvents, operating at a tempera ture of between 20 and 150 C.
