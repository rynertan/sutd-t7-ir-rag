# Robot joint angle detecting system.

## Abstract
In a system for detecting an angle of a joint 2 coupled through a reduction mechanism 3 to a drive motor M , an ab solute type rotation angle detector RE and an incremental type rotation number detector PG, 4 are coupled to the mo tor for detecting the rotational angle and the rotation number of the motor M , respectively. The detected rotational angle and the detected rotation number are used to calculate the ro tational angle of the joint. The incremental type rotation num ber detector is provided with a battery 9 for energization dur ing interruption of a power supply.
