# Photodiode having heterojunction.

## Abstract
The photodiode comprises a substrate 6 with an optical epitaxial layer 7 carrying a light absorbing, avalanche layer 8 formed of InGaAs. This forms a heterojunction with a layer 10 of wider bandgap InP. This in turn forms a PN or Schottky junction with a T region 11, 12 . In order to improve the response time there is introduced into the heterojunction a thin layer 9 which is not more than 0.1 micron thick. The thin layer may be InP more highly doped than the contiguous InP layer 10 and or a thin layer of InGaAs more highly doped than the contiguous InGaAs layer 8 .
