# A process for conducting reactions using a circulating magnetically stabilized bed to control reaction temperature profile.

## Abstract
A process for conducting a chemical reaction in a reac tor comprising a subjecting a flowable bed containing magnetizable particles to an applied magnetic field b circulating a reaction fluid through the reactor in a plug flow manner at a rate such that the fluid exerts pres sure against and levitates the particles in the bed c circulating the bed of particles through the reactor in a plug flow manner, and thereafter recirculating the bed to the reactor, the circulating and recirculating of the bed being conducted at a rate such that the temperature profile of the bed and reaction fluid results in maximisation, at each position in the reactor, of conversion, selectivity and or product yield and d recovering one or more reaction products.
