## Description
ORAL COM206ITIONS The present invention relates to oral coEpositions containing antimicrobial agent effective against plaque and a sufficient amount of a carboxylate compound and optionally a water soluble magnesium salt to reduce the stain on teeth caused by the antimicrobial agent. The use of antimicrobial agents to reduce plaque has been recognized for many years. The staining problems associated with such agents have also been recognized. Included among references disclosing antiplaque antistain coqpositions areUS A 3,937,805, US A 3,937,807, US A 4,080,441, US A 4,118,474, US A 4,241,049, US A 3,925,543 and US A 4,256,731. The use of magnesium salts in oral products generally has also been disclosed in the prior art. See for example US A 4,217,342, US A 4,259,316 and US A 4,309,409. While the prior art discloses the usefulness of antimicrobials and attempts to reduce the stain caused ty the antimicrobials, completely satisfactory answers have not been obtained. Plaque is believed to be the result of bacteria in the mouth which react with nutrients in saliva to form a deposit on tooth surfaces. Antimicrobials have been shown to be able to interrupt this cycle and thereby reduce the level of plaque formed. However, the antimicrobials are believed to induce mineralization of plaque, thereby trapping coloured entities. It has now been found that by combining a carboxylate compound with the antimicrobial, a reduction in staining can be achieved while still providing the therapeutic efficacy of the compositions and the decrease in staining can be extended by the addition of a water soluble magnesium salt. tt is therefore an object of the present invention to formulate effective antiplaquelantigingivitis compositions. By reducing plaque, caries, and or calculus may also be reduced It is a further object of the present invention to formulate antiplaquelantigingivitis compositions which have reduced staining. It is still a further object of the present invention to provide a method for reducing plaquelgingivitis. These and other objects will become more apparent from the detailed description which follows. All percentages and ratios herein are by weight unless otherwise specified The present invention relates to oral compositions which provide antiplaquelantigingivitis benefits while causing less stain, comprising a a safe and effective amount of an antimicrobial b a carboxylic acid having a PKa in the range of about 3 to about 6 or a water soluble salt thereof or mixtures of said salts and acids, wherein both the acid and the counter ion of the salt are compatible with the anti microbial c optionally, a water soluble magnesium salt and d a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier wherein the molar ratio of the carboxylic acid or salt thereof to the antimicrobial is at least 70 1, the molar ratio of magnesium, if present, to the antimicrobial is at least 10 1 and the pH of the composition is from about 3 to about 6, preferably from about 4 to about 6, and or has such a pH when dissolved in water or saliva. The compositions of this invention employ an antimicrobial in combination with a carboxylic acid or water soluble salt thereof and, optionally and preferably, a water soluble magnesium salt. These and other components will be described in detail hereinafter. By safe and effective amount of an antimicrobial, as used herein, means sufficient compound to reduce plaque while being safe to the hard and soft tissues of the oral cavity. By compatible with the antimicrobial as used herein is meant that the carboxylic acid or the counter ion of a salt thereof or any other material present will not form an insoluble pre cipitate with the antimicrobial. By the term comprising, as used herein, is meant that various additional components can be conjointly employed in the compositions of this invention as long as the antimicrobial and the carboxylic acid or salt thereof can perform their intended functions. By the term carrier,1, as used herein, is meant a suitable vehicle which is pharmaceutically acceptable and can be used to apply the present compositions in the oral cavity. By the term water soluble, as used herein, is meant having a solubility sufficient to provide the quantities required herein at least about 0.023 g 100 g. at 25 C .Antimicrobial The antimicrobials used in the compositions of the present invention can be any of a wide variety of materials which may function in many different ways to reduce plaque gingivitis.Included among these materials are cationic antimicrobial agents such as quaternary ammonium e.g. cetyl pyridinium chloride compounds and substituted guanidines such as chlorhexidine and the corresponding compound alexidine phenolics e.g. salicylanilide tertiary amines. e.g. hexetidine peroxides such as hydrogen peroxide and material such as antibiofics e.g. pent cilin . The preferred materials are the cationic antimicrobials, the substituted guanidines. Antimicrobial quaternary ammonlum compounds include those in which one or two of the substituents on the quaternary nitrogen has a carbon chain length typically alkyl group of some 8 to 20, typically 10 to 18 carbon atoms while the remaining substituents typically alkyl or benzyl group have a lower number of carbon atoms, such as 1 to 7 carbon atoms, typically methyl or ethyl groups. Dodecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide, dodecyl dimethyl 2 phenoxyethyl ammonium bromide, benzyl dimethylstearyl ammonium chloride, cetyl pyridinium chloride, quaternized 5 amino l ,3 bis 2 ethyl hexyl 5 methyl hexa hydropyrimidine and benzethonium chloride are exemplary of typical quaternary ammonium antibacterial agents. Cetyl pyridinium chloride is a preferred quaternary ammonium compound. The substituted guanidines of this invention include bisbiguanide compounds having the generic formulaEMI4.1 wherein A and A each represent either 1 a phenyl radical which optionally is substituted by an alkyl or alkoxy group containing from 1 to about 4 carbon atoms, a nitro group, or a halogen atoms 2 an alkyl group containing from l to about 12 carbon atoms or 3 alicyclic groups containing from 4 to about 12 carbon atoms wherein X and X each represent an alkylene radical containing fron 1 to 3 carbon atoms wherein Z and Z each can be either 0 or 1 wherein R and R each represent either hydrogen, an alkyl radical containing from 1 to about 12 carbon atoms, or an aralkyl radical containing from 7 to about 12 carbon atoms wherein n is an integer frorn 2 to 12 inclusive wherein the polymethylene chain tCH2 n may optionally be interrupted by oxygen or sulfur atoms, aromatic nuclei, etc. The water soluble salts of the above compounds are preferred for use herein. Suitable water soluble salts include the acatate,the fluoride, and especially the giuconatz saJ The preferred sub stituted guanidine is chlorhexidine 1,6 di N5 p chlorophenyl N diguanido hexane . The above compounds are offective anti plaque antigingrvitis agents However, when coinpositions containing these compoun are used continuously in a program of oral hygiene, a rather offensive brown stain forms on the oral surfaces which is resistant to removal. This stain problem prevents compositions containing these compounds from being accepted by the consumer when used at levels sufficient to deliver a significant anti plaque benefit. The antimicrobial is used in an amount that is effective while yet being safe to use in the oral cavity. Such amounts are easily determined tXy the skilled artisan and are generally froth about 0.001 to about 10 , preferably from about 0.918 to about 2 , most preferably from about 0.05 to about 1.08. Many more acceptable antimicrobials and their properties are found in Franklin, T.J. and Snow, G.A., Biochemistry ofAntimicrobial ActionS, Chapman and Hall, London and John Wiley Sons, N.Y. 2nd. Ed. 1975 , incorporated herein by reference Carboxylic Acid or Water Soluble Salt Thereof The carboxylic acids suitable for use in the present compositions are those water soluble acids which have a pKa of from about 3 to about 6, preferably is from about 4.5 to about 5.5 and are compatible with the antimicrobial. The carboxylic acicf and or its water soluble salt is present in a molar ratio of at least 70 1, preferably from about 75 1 to about 750 1.The water soluble salts of such acids found most useful are those whereon the counter ions are sodium, lithium, potassium, magnesium and zinc.

The carboxylic acid may be a mono, di, tri or polycarboxylic acid. It may also be substituted, saturated or unsaturated. The substituents should also be compatible with the antimicrobial. The preferred acids include acetic acid, gluconic acid, adipic acid and mixtures thereof.Pharmaceutically Acceptable Carrier The carrier for the antimicrobial, the carboxylate compound and the preferred magnesium salt can be any vehicle suitable for use in the oral cavity. Such carriers include the usual components of mouthwashes, toothpastes, tooth powders, prophylaxis pastes, and the like and is more fully described hereinafter. One embodiment of the present invention is a dentifrice, especially a toothpaste. Dentifrices preferably contain from about 0.18 to 2.0 by weight of the antimicrobial component. Dentifrices also contain an abrasive polishing material and typically also contain sudsing agents, flavoring agents and sweetening agents. Toothpaste compositions additionally contain binders, humectants and water. The dentifrice abrasive, generally has a particle size of from about 0.1 to about 10 microns in diameter and can be any abrasive polishing material which does not excessively abrade tooth dentÃ®n. These include, for example, silica, both precipitated and gels, calcium carbonate, dicalcium orthophosphate dihydrate, calcium pyrophosphate, calcium polymetrphosphate and insoluble sodium polymetaphosphate. Preferably, however, the abrasive is one which has a high degree of compatibility with the bisbiguanides. These include, for example silica xerogels such as those described in U.S. Patent 3,538,230 to Pader et al, issuedNovember 3, 1970 hydrofluoric acid treated amorphous silica abrasives such as those disclosed in U.S.Patent 3,862,307 to DlGiulio, issued January 21, 1975 mineral abrasives coated with cationic polymers such as those disclosed by J. 3. Benedict in U.S. Patent 4,157,387, issued June 5, 1979 and condensation products of urea and formaldehyde such as those disclosed inCooley et al, in U.S. Patent 3,070,510, issued December 25, 1972 All of these patents are incorporated by reference. The total amount of abrasive materials in the dentifrice embodiments of this invention can range from about 0.58 to about 95E by weight of the dentifrice. Preferably toothpastes contain from about 6 to about 608 by weight and toothpowders contain from about 20 to about 95 by weight abrasives. Dentifrice compositions can also corrtain emulsifying agentsSuitable emulsifying agents are those which are reasonably stable and foam throughout a wide pH range, and which will not react with the bis biguanide compound, i.e., non soap nonionic, cationic, zwitterionic and amphoteric organic synthetic detergents.Many of these suitable surfactants are disclosed by Gieske et aI in U.S. Patent 4,051,234, September 27, 1977, incorporated herein by reference. It is common to have a water soluble fluoride compound present in dentifrices in an amount sufficient to give a fluoride concentration of from about 0.0025 to about 5.090 by weight, preferably from about 0.005 to about 2. 0 by weight, to provide additional anticaries effectiveness. Preferred fluorides are sodium fluoride, stannous fluoride, indium fluoride, and sodium monofluorophosphate. Norris et at, U.S. Patent X,946, 2S, issued July 26, 1960 and Widder et al, U.S. Patent 3,678,154, issuedJuly 18, 1972. In preparing toothpastes, it is necessary to add some thickening material to provide a desirable consistency. Preferred thickening agents are carboxyvinyl polymers, hydroxyethyl cel lulose and water soluble salts of cellulose ethers such as carboxymethyl cellulose and sodium carboxymethyl hydroxyethyl cellulose. Natural gums such as gum karaya, gun arabic, and gum tragacanth can also be used. ColloÃ®dal magnesium altiminum silicate or finely divided silica can be used as part of the thickening agent to further improve texture. ThJckening agents in an amount from 0.5 to 5.0 by weight of the total composition can be used. It is also desirable to include some humectant material in a toothpaste to keep st from hardening. Suitable humectants in clude glycerin, sorbitol, and other edible polyhydric alcohols. The humectant can comprise up to about 65 by weight of the toothpaste composition. Flavoring agents can also be added to dentifrice com positions. Suitable flavoring agents include oil of wintergreen, oil of peppermint, oil of spearmint, oil of sassafras, and oil of clove. Sweetening agents which can be used include aspartame, acesulfame, saccharin, dextrose, levulose and sodium cyclamate, Flavoring agents are generally used in dentifrices at levels of from about 0.052 to about 2 by weight. A preferred embodiment of the instant invention is a mouthwash composition. Conventional mouthwash composition com ponents can comprise the carrier for the antimicrobial and car boxylate of the present invention. Mouthwashes generally com prise about 20 1 to about 2 1 of a water ethyl alcohol solution and preferably other ingredients such as flavor, sweeteners, humectants and sudsing agents such as those mentioned above for dentifrices. The humectants, such as glycerin and sorbitol give a moist feel to the mouth.Generally, on a weight basis the mouthwashes of the invention comprise 5 to 60 prefcfably 10 to 25 ethyl alcohol, 0 to 20 preferably 5 to 20 of a humec tant, 0 to 2 preferably 0.01 to 0.158 emulsifying agent, 05 to 0,59 preferably 0.005 to 0.068 sweetening agent such as saccharin, 0 to Q.3t preferably 0.0396 to 0.3 flavoring agent, and the balance water.
