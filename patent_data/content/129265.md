# Methods of manufacturing semiconductor devices with reduction in the charge carrier trap density.

## Abstract
A plasma and heating treatment is performed to reduce the density of charge carrier traps adjacent the interface of an insulating layer 12 e.g. of thermally grown silicon dioxide and a semiconductor body 10. During this plasma and heating treatment the device structure so far formed 12 to 16 is covered with an additional layer 20 e.g. of silane deposited silicon containing hydrogen, and this additional layer 20 protects the insulating layer 12 from direct bombardment by the plasma. After the plasma and heating treatment the addi tional layer 12 is removed from at least most areas of the semiconductor device structure 12 to 16 . The heating e.g. at about 400 C or less may be effected during and or after the plasma treatment.
