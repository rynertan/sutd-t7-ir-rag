# Magnetic reluctance sensing apparatus and method.

## Abstract
Disclosed is an improved method and apparatus for sensing magnetic reluctance variations. The invention may be used for magnetic ink character reading, such as is employed on bank checks, or for any of a variety of magnetic reluctance pickup applications. An improved magnetic re luctance sensor head 3 utilizes an essentially U or C shaped magnetically permeable member 2 having a magnetizing coil encircling it. The coil is arranged to deliver essentially a constant magnetic flux to the U or C shaped member. The tips of the U or C are placed adjacent to the element whose variation of reluctance is to be detected, e.g. a sheet of paper 12 having magnetic ink 13 deposited thereon, and a magneto resistive or other similar magnetic sensor is connected in the magnetic circuit either in parallel or in series with the variable reluctance which is to be sensed.
