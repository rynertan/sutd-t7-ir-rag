# Capped electric lamp.

## Abstract
A capped electric lamp has a lamp cap 9 of synthetic material comprising a cup shaped part 10 having a circular cylindrical wall portion 11 with an axis 12 and a bottom 13 , further a panel 16 in which contact members 20 are anchored and a sleeve shaped part 17 which surrounds these contact members. There is fixed in the cup shaped part 10 a metal sleeve 7 which is telescopically joined at one end 8 with a flanged edge 6 of a metal clamping plate 5 and is connected thereto, while a seal 2 of a lamp vessel 1 is fixed in an opening of this clamping plate. The lamp is of a simple construction that can be readily manufactured and permits positioning of an electric element 3 in a predetermined position with respect to the lamp cap 9 . Little space is required in the direction of the axis 12 because a plug in connector member is arranged at right angles to the axis 12 , while the presence of the sleeve shaped part 17 prevents corrosion of the contact members 20 .
