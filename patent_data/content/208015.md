# Transmission apparatus.

## Abstract
A transmission has a torque converter with an impeller I , primary and secondary turbines T1, T2 and a stator 5 . In a first planetary gear set PL1 the carrier C1 is connected to the primary turbine T1 , the sun gear S1 is connected to the secondary turbines T2 and the ring gear R1 is connected to a one way clutch OWC1 . A second planetary gear set PL2 has a second carrier C2 connected to the output shaft T0 and a second ring gear R2 connected to the first carrier C1 . A brake BR 2 is connected to the one way clutch OWC1 ands to the second sun gear S2 for low forward operation. The one way clutch OWC2 is used in the first phase of low forward and in reverse. A clutch CL1 locks up the second planetary gear set PL2 in drive operation. The one way clutch OWC1 is centrifically dis abled before and during drive operation. A second brake BR2 brakes the primary turbine T1 , the first carrier C1 , and the second ring gear R2 in reverse operation, causing the secondary turbine T2 to drive the first sun gear S1 and the first ring gear R1 to drive the second sun gear S2 through the one way clutch OWC1 to turn the output shaft T0 slowly in reverse. A second one way clutch OWC2 connected to the stator S provides phase differentiation in low forward and drive operations.
