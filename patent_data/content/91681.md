# APPARATUS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF REINFORCING NON WOVEN FABRICS FOR COMPOSITES

## Abstract
The disclosure relates to an apparatus for the production of reinforcement non woven net fabric NW which is provided with selvage nipping devices 17 for nipping selvages of a weft sheet WE or loop end portion of weft thread reaches at both sides and advancing the weft sheet WE with thread reaches laterally tensioned, adhesive applying device 16 for coating thermoplastic adhesive to the weft sheet WE being nipped by the selvage nipping devices 17 except the selvage portion of the weft sheet WE , heat device 18 fo drying and melting the adhesive on the weft sheet WE , a sheet pressing device 21a,21b for pressing and bonding to each other the weft sheet WE with melted adhesive thereon and a preheated warp sheet WA . Accordingly, during applying of the adhesive the thread reaches can be maintained exactly straight and in parallel and spaced relationship, and no adhesive is applied to most portion of the warp thread 6 , other than the intersection points to the weft sheet WE . Further, the sheet press device 21a,21b has its peripheral surface which is controlled so as to keep the temperature lower than softening point of the adhesive, whereby the composite of weft and warp sheets can be easily and rapidly released from the sheet pressing device 21a, 21b .
