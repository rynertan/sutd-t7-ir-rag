# Method and apparatus for controlling electrode drive speed in a consumable electrode furnace.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for controlling electrode drive speed in a consumable electrode furnace. The electrode drive speed is regulated at a base speed computed from measured changes in physical characteristics of the elec trode 18 or ingot 34 , such as changes in weight, as the melt proceeds. The base speed also takes into consideration the known geometry of the electrode 18 , the furnace mould or crucible 12 , the density of the ingot material 34 , and the speed of movement of the bottom of the ingot if any. This base speed is increased or decreased by a trim speed determined from measurement of an electrical phenomenon associated with the consumable electrode process, which electrical phenomenon has a relatively long term value related to the distance between the bottom surface of the electrode 18 and the top surface of the ingot 34 .
