## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates generally to radiography and more particularly to an X ray image producing system incorporated in a TV system. When a shadow image of an object irradiated by X rays in an X ray TV system is stored in a picture memory, the reproduced image is coarse and of low quality. This is because the object is given a relatively small X ray dose, so that the image is substantially disturbed by the quantum noise of X rays. The situation may be compared to that in which an underexposed photograph is taken in a conventional optical camera. In optical cameras it is easy to obtain an amount of light necessary for a proper exposure and it is quite rare to be unable to increase the amount of light. In diagnostic radiography, however, if the amount of X rays for exposure is increased, the patient will receive a higher radiation dose, which must be avoided from the medical point of view. Therefore, practically radiographs are always underexposed. Accordingly, it is one object of the invention to provide an apparatus for recording X ray shadow images, in which the influence by X ray quantum noise is substantially reduced when the intensity of X ray available is not sufficient for proper exposure, so that a shadow image of high quality can be obtained. One of the most important and useful applications of radiography is diagnosis of diseases, and there have been developed various radiographical techniques, amoung which the digital subtraction technique has recently made a marked technical advance in its application to angiography.In the digital subtraction technique, a video processor is used to convert on real time basis the video signal to digital signals, so that subtraction is conducted to produce a subtraction image. In the digital subtraction technique the resolution is remarkably improved in comparision with the conventional subtraction technique employing photographic films, so that it becomes possible to make diagnosis with angiographs obtained with contrast material injected intravenously. Since the digital subtraction technique makes angiography easier to conduct, it is possible to obtain angiograms on a TV screen. This certainly is a great advantage. In the digital subtraction technique, in order to reduce the adverse influence of X ray quantum noise it has been customary to use a radiation dose of much the same level as is used in ordinary direct radiography, with resulting substantial increase in the radiation dose received by the person under examination. The radiation dose to the person must be the minimum required to provide necessary diagnostic information. Accordingly, another object of the invention is to provide a digital subtraction radiographic system which can produce an X ray image of high quality with as low a radiation dose as is used for X ray fluoroscopy by reducingX ray quantum noise. The invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawing. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING Fig. 1 is a block diagram of one embodiment of the invention Fig. 2 is a block diagram of another embodiment of the invention and Fig. 3 is a waveform diagram for explanation of the principle of operation of the invention. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention provides an X ray image producing system, in which a patient to be examined is irradiated so that anX ray image of the irradiated portion of the patient s body is obtained on the screen of an image intensifier. TheX ray image is converted by a TV camera to a corresponding video signal, which is digitized to provide digital video signals corresponding to the picture elements of the X ray image. The level of each of the digital video signals corresponding to one of the picture elements in one frame is stored in the corresponding one of the memory sections of a frame memory for comparision with the level of the corresponding one of the digital signals in the next frame so that the lower or higher one of the two levels compared in each of the picture elements is stored in the frame memory for comparision with the level of the corresponding digital signal in the succeeding frame. After a predetermined period of time corresponding to, e.g., 30 frames, the highest or lowest level of the digital video signal in each of the picture elements of the X ray image has been stored in the frame memory. The digital signals in the memory are read out and converted to a corresponding analog video signal for display of the X ray image from which the influence by X ray quantum noise as well as noise inherent in the electronic circuits has been substantially eliminated. The invention also provides a digital subtraction system, in which both mask and live X ray images from which the influence by X ray quantum noise and other noises has been substantially eliminated are formed by using the above mentionedX ray image producing system, so that the mask image is subtracted from the live image to produce a subtraction image of high quality. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Referring now to the drawing, first to Fig. 1, there is shown an X ray TV system which comprises an X ray generator 11, an X ray image intensifier 13, a TV camera 14, a camera control unit, a video processor 20 and a TV monitor 16. The X ray generator 11 projects a beam of X rays onto a person 12 being examined. As the beam passes through the person, it forms an X ray shadow image of the irradiated portion of the body of the person 12 in accordance with theX ray absorption characteristics of the body portion. The image intensifier 13 receives the X ray image and converts it to a visible optical image, with simultaneous amplification of the brightness of the image. The m camera 14 is so controlled by the unit 15 as to convert the optical image on the screen of the intensifier 13 to a corresponding video signal, which is transmitted to the TV monitor 16 directly or through the video processor 20. The video processor 20 comprises an input switch 21, an A D converter 23, a switch 24, a comparator 25, a frame memory 26, a D A converter 27, an output switch 22 and a sequence controller 28. The frame memory 26 has a plurality of sections each corresponding to one of the picture elements which constitute a frame. When the X ray image is to be displayed on the screen of the monitor 16 in on line mode just as it is taken by the camera 14, the input and output switches 21 and 22 are so operated that the respective switch arms are kept at the illustrated position, whereupon the video signal from the TV camera 14 is transmitted through a bypass lineL connected between the switches 21 and 22 to the TV monitor 16 without any image processing having been conducted. To record the image taken by the TV camera 14 while observing the image, a knob or the like on a control panel not shown is operated to change from the on line image display mode to the recorded image display mode, whereupon the sequence controller 28 first initializes all of the memory sections of the frame memory 26 to the maximum value. Upon completion of the intiallization the controller 28 causes the input and output switches 21 and 22 to be changed over to the position opposite to the illustrated position and the switch 24 to the illustrated position, whereupon the video signal from the camera 14 is digitized by the A D converter 23, so that the digital signals are applied to the comparator 25. On the other hand, the sequence controller 28 causes the frame memory 26 to apply the digital data previously stored in the sections of the frame memory to the comparator 25, in which the digitized video signals from the A D converter 23 and the digital data read out from the frame memory 26 are compared in each and every one of the picture elements of each frame, so that the smaller one of the two values in each of the picture elements is stored in the corresponding one of the sections in the frame memory 26. The above operation is repeated for a period of time, say,l second, covering a predetermined number of frames, say, 30 frames, set by a suitable device such as a digital switch not shown but provided on the previously mentioned operating panel. When the above period of time has elapsed, the sequence controller 28 causes the input and output switches 21 and 22 to be changed over to the illustrated original position thereby to terminate the recording operation. In the course of the above recording operation, the digital signals to be successively stored in the frame memory 26 are also applied to the D A converter 27, which converts them to a corresponding analog signal. The TV monitor 16 receives the analog signal and converts it to a corresponding picture to be displayed on its screen. Each of the sections of the frame memory 26 sufficiently has the same number of bits as the A D converter 23. The recorded picture obtained at the end of the abovementioned recording operation conducted for a period of time covering a plurality of frames that is, the picture stored in the frame memory 26 at the end of the recording operation is composed of the digital signals from the A D converter 23 which have the lowest level attained in each of the picture elements during the period of time for recording. Fig. 3 shcematically shows the video signal from theTV camera 14 corresponding to one of the horizontal scanning lines of a frame, with the horizontal synchronizing pulses being designated by H. Due to X ray quantum noise, the signal bl fluctuates minutely and at random about what is believed to be the true value or level a of the signal, so that the waveform of the signal bl contains a number of minute peaks and valleys. Next time the same horizontal line is scanned for the next frame, the video signal fluctuates differently as shown at b2. Thus every time the same line is scanned for successive different frames, the video signal fluctuates differently and at random. This is true with all the other scanning lines of the frames. Therefore, to select the lowest level of the video signal attained in each of the picture elements during the period of time over the predetermined number of frames is to form an envelope c passing through the lowest points of the valleys of the fluctuating curves bl, b2, ... . The envelope c can be considered as the true value a having been shifted downwardly in parallel. In othe words, the video signal corresponding to the true value a has been recorded withX ray quantum noise having been substantially eliminated.Therefore, by reading out the signal values stored in the frame memory 26 it is possible to display on the screen of the TV monitor 16 an image substantially equivalent to the true image without appreciable influence by X ray quantum noise. Not only the random X ray quantum noise but also any random noise in the TV camera system are eliminated in the course of the above mentioned recording operation. In the above mentioned operation the lowest value of the video signal in each of the picture elements are selected.It is possible to select the highest values or peaks of the fluctuating video signal to form an envelope c shifted upward in parallel with the true value a. In accordance with the invention, by comparing the video signal in each of the picture elements of each of the successive frames which constitute an X ray shadow image and the video signal in the corresponding one of the picture elements of the succeeding frame, and storing the lowest or highest value of the signal in each of the picture elements, it is possible to make the video signal substantially equivalent to the true signal, that is, to substantially eliminate the adverse influence of X ray quantum noise thereby to obtain a recorded picture of the X ray shadow image of a higher quality than the recorded picture obtained by recording the X ray shadow image in a single frame. Turning to Fig. 2, there is schematically shown a digital subtraction system constructed in accordance with the invention. In Fig. 2 the same reference numerals as inFig. 1 designate the corresponding parts or elements so that no explanation will be given to them except when necessary. The video signal from the TV camera 14 is applied to a video processor 20S, wherein digital subtraction is conducted on the X ray image taken by the camera 14 in the following manner. The video processor 20S comprises an input switch 21S, a logarithmic converter 30, an A D converter 23, a comparator 25, a frame memory 26M for storing the mask image, a frame memory 26L for storing the live image, a subtractor 40, a frame memory 41 for storing the subtraction image, an enhancement circuit 42, a D A converter 27, a sequence controller 28 and switches 32, 33 and 34 controlled by the controller 28. The video signal from the camera 14 is applied to the logarithmic converter 30 for logarithmic conversion. This makes it possible to obtain the ratio of the level of the signal caused by the object to the level of the signal caused by the background regardless of the absolute value of the video signal and to obtain a sharp picture of the object such as blood vessels no matter whether or not bones are superimposed on the blood vessels. When it is desired to make the video signal bypass the logarithmic converter 30, the switch 21S is changed over to the side opposite the illustrated position. The video signal is then digitized by the A D converter 23. When the sequence controller 28 causes the switch 32 to be closed to the illustrated side and the switch 33 to be closed, the image of the object before injection of contrast material is stored as a mask image in the frame memory 26M, with the comparator 25 and the memory 26M cooperatively functioning as a picture memory of the peak or bottom holding type in the same manner as the comparator 25 and the frame memory 26 in the system of Fig. 1. In particular, the digital video signals from the A D converter 23 which correspond to each of a predetermined number of frames of the picture and the digital video signals of the immediately preceeding one frame stored in and read out from the frame memory 26M are compared by the comparator 25 in each and every one of the picture elements of the frame, so that the smaller or greater one of the two signal values in each of the picture elements is stored in the frame memory 26M. The operation is repeated for a predetermined period of time, e.g., 1 one second corresponding to a predetermined number, e.g., 30 frames, whereupon the lowest or highest level of the video signal reached in each of the picture elements during the above mentioned period of time has been stored in each of the corresponding sections of the frame memory 26M. In other words, the X ray shadow image of the object under examination before injection of contrast material has been stored in the frame memory 26M as a mask image from which the influence of X ray quantum noise has been substantially eliminated as previously explained with reference to Fig. 3. When contrast material is injected into the object under examination, with the controller 28 operating to cause the switch 33 to be opened, the switch 34 to be closed and the switch 32 to be closed at the position opposite the illustrated position, the comparator 25 and the frame memory 26L cooperate to function as a picutre memory of the peak holding type in the same manner as mentioned above, so that the peak value of the digital video signal attained in each of the picture elements in each frame during a predetermined period of time, say, 1 one second covering 30 frames is stored in the frame memory 26L. In other words, a live image substantially free of X ray quantum noise has been stored in the frame memory 26L. The mask image stored in and read out from the frame memory 26M and the live image stored in and read out from the frame memory 26L are applied to the subtraction circuit 40, which subtracts the former from the latter image to produce a subtraction image to be written in the subtraction image memory 41 by the instruction from the sequence controller 28. When the above mentioned period of time for recording, that is, 1 one second corresponding to 30 frames has passed, the frame memory 26L is cleared of the live image stored therein so as to be ready for recording a new live image which will be obtained in the next recording period of one second or 30 frames. In this manner, the live image stored in the frame memory 26L and consequently the subtraction image stored in the memory 41 are renewed upon lapse of every predetermined period of time, that is, one second. During the above mentioned period of time before the next new subtraction image is written in the subtraction image memory 41, the subtraction image stored in the memory 41 is read out repeatedly as many times as is necessary to provide the number of frames, say, 30 frames required by the TV monitor 16 for display. The subtraction image read out from the memory 41 is applied to the enhancement circuit 42, which increases the contrast of the image. The output in digital form from the enhancement circuit 42 is converted by the D A converter 27 to a corresponding analog signal, which is applied to theTV monitor 16. As is apparent from the foregoing descrip tion, the TV monitor 16 displays the subtraction image which is renewed every one second. In the system of Fig. 2 the person under examination continuously receives as low a radiation dose as in fluoroscopic examination. The mode of operation, however, is similar to the serial mode since the subtraction image obtained changes at predetermined intervals. The subtraction technique of the invention requires a relatively low radiation dose to obtain a subtraction image of high quality and can be operated with not only intravenous but also intra arterial injection of contrast agent.In the intra arterial injection method, a smaller radiation dose to the patient than is required for radiography with photographic films suffices for a subtraction image of higher quality to be obtained. In this method, although the injected contrast agent moves through the artery, the peak holding effect the system of the invention has on the area where the injected contrast agent exits enables a relatively small amount of contrast agent to produce a subtraction image with sharp contrast. Therefore, the amount of contrast agent to be injected to the body can be substantially reduced.
