# Improved fabric coating composition with low formaldehyde evolution.

## Abstract
An improved polymeric latex coating composition, which substantially comprises an aqueous emulsion of alkyl acrylate monomers copolymerized with acrylonitrile, itaco nic acid, and N methylol acrylamide and containing a glyoxal curing resin and an acid catalyst, substantially reduces the evolution of formaldehyde and exhibits good durability.
