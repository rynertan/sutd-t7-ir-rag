# METHOD OF RECOVERING URANIUM

## Abstract
Method of recovering uranium from a silicate uranium co precipitate by leaching the coprecipitate with a leachate having a pH of from 2 to 3, followed by filtering the coprecipitate. The uranium is dissolved in the filtrate but the silicate is insoluble. The leachate is preferably an aqueous solution of nitric acid which is also used to wash the coprecipitate. The uranium can be extracted from the filtrate using an organic extractant con taining DEPA TOPO.
