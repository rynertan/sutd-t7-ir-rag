## Description
COATED CATION EXCHANGE RESIN AND METHOD FOR FORMINGThe present invention relates to a method of forming a component of an ion exchange composition useful for performing liquid ion chromatography.Ion chromatography is useful for anion or cation analysis, as described in U.S. Patent No. 3,920,397. A useful ion exchange composition includes insoluble synthetic resin substrate particles, having ion exchange sites at least on their exposed or available surface, and finely divided synthetic resin layering particles, having ion exchange sites at least on their outer surfaces. The layering particles are irreversibly attached as a monolayer to the support particles to produce a low capacity pellicular type ion exchanger, as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,101,460. At column 5, lines 21 24 of that patent, it is stated that the best performances are generally obtained using a latex to prepare the monolayer of layering particle, since a highly uniform monolayer can be obtained from a latex system. In accordance with conventional polymer terminology, a latex is a stable dispersion of fine polymer particles in an aqueous medium.Even though the 60 patent recognizes the benefits of forming the pellicular resin using a latex of the layering particles, the specific disclosure is of forming the pellicular resin from a latex comprising the use of a latex with anion exchanging sites herein, an anion latex , and does not disclose a latex with particles containing cation exchanging sites herein, cation latex . Instead, to form a pellicular cation exchanging site resin, the patent only discloses the grinding of conventional ion exchange resin to a fine powder. It is recognized that such particles are not spherical, have a wide size distribution, and generally do not perform as well as ones formed from a latex. There are significant advantages in Ion chromatography in forming the pellicular resin using very small layering particles, as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,3S3,0S7. That patent refers specifically to layering particle having a volume average diameter of less than 900 microns, and only discloses the formation of the pellicular resin using the layering particles in latex form. This is because the other technique disclosed in the i60 patent of forming the layering particles, namely grinding, is not capable of forming suitable layering particles in this size range. However, the 9087 patent is limited to anion exchange pellicular resin.The logical conclusion to be drawn from this b that the patentee was unable to produce a cation latex.One might assume that it would be r simple matter to provide an analogous technique for forming cation exchange latexes based upon the techniques disclosed for forming anion exchange latexes, e.g., in the 460 patent. That patent describes producing a neutral, water insoluble polymer latex from crosslinked vlnylbenzyichloride, and then functionalizing the latex to the desired form by reaction with a tertiary amine. The analogous procedure to form a cation latex would be to use the same procedure except that sulfite or bisulfite ion is used in place of the tertiary amine. The resulting product would be the sulfonated vinylbenzylchloride polymer instead of the quaternked vinylbenzyl polymer. This is an example of the Strecker reaction, in which alkyl halides are reacted with suifites to synthesize sulfonate. However, attempts to use this procedure were unsuccessful.In German patent 1,07S,l33 to Dow Chemical Company, the vinylbenzylchloride polymer is first converted to a dialkyl sulfonium intermediate, and then the sulfonium group is displaced with sulfite to form the sulfonate. However, the use of this procedure destabilizes the latex.We have now developed a cation latex of fine insoluble synthetic resin particles with strong acid cation exchanging sites on their exposed sur faces, which latex may be used to form a pellicular resin on support particles having an opposite charge, which is particularly suitable for use in an ion chromatography. Accordingly, the present invention provides a cation exchange latex formed of dispersed fine insoluble synthetic resin particles with strong acid e.g., sulfonic cation exchanging sites at least on their exposed surfaces. The invention further relates to a method of forming such a latex, in which a monomer phase comprising a base mortomer e.g., styrene and a cross linking monomer e.g., divinylbenzene , is mixed with an aqueous phase including a polymerization catalyst and a surfactant, preferably a ncn ionic one, and the monomer phase is polymerized to form the latex. Thereafter, a sulfonating agent, preferably sulfuric acid, fuming sulfuric acid, or a mixture thereof, is used to sulfonate the resin while maintaining the latex in a stable form.A strong acid cation exchange composition is formed by mixing the above latex with synthetic resin support particles having anion exchanging sites at their exposed surfaces, which attract the cationaexchange sites of the latex particles to form layering particles which are irreversibly attached as a monolayer to the support particles. Such layering particles are characterized by a narrow width of distribution, sigma, and are capable of formation in a very fine size, i.e., less than 0.1 micron. Cation exchange compositions of the above type are particularly effective for the separation of cations by ion chromatography.Figure 1 is a schematic representation of apparatus in which the cation exchange composition of the present invention is effectively used for chromatographic separation. The ion exchange composition of the present invention includes synthetic resin support particles with anion exchange sites at their exposed surfaces to which fine synthetic resin layering particles with cation exchange sites on their exposed surfaces are irreversibly attached by attraction of the respective ion exchange sites. The present description will refer first to the support particles. The support particles may be formed from the same type of synthetic resin as described in the aforementioned tri60 and 087 patents, incorporated herein by reference.The support particles typically are sized with a median diameter between 3 microns and 100 microns, and preferably between 3 microns and 23 microns. In general, smaller substrate particles lead to higher chromatographic efficiencies.The substrate particles may be relatively nonporous, or substantially porous, such as of the type known as macroreticular or macroporous resin. Substrate particles of the latter type are described in U.S. Patent No. 4,331,909. Typically, such particles will be nonporous, that is, retaining the porosity typically present in forming conventional nonporous resins.The substrate particles have anion exchange sites on their exterior or outer available surfaces. Such sites are preferably strongly basic generally of aminated functional groups.Although any of the polymers described in the above patents may be used as the substrate particles, particularly effective ones are synthetic resin beads of a styrenedivinylbenzene copolymer containing at least about 0.S divinylbenzene cross linking agent, where the beads are in the surface aminated form, and, preferably containing about 20 divinylbenzene for a fully aminated form of bead particle.An important feature of the present invention is the method of forming the cation exchanging partick and their use. Such layering particles are formed in a cation latex comprising an aqueous latex of dispersed fine insoluble synthetic resin particles with strong acid cation exchanging sites on their surfaces.Suitable strong acid functional groups are sulfonate and phosphonate, while sulfonate is preferred.Layering particles formed in a latex have certain highly desirable characteristics. Firstly, since the latex is a stable colloidal dispersion, the particles are readily distributed in a monolayer over the surface of the substrate particles. In addition, such particles are characterized by a relatively narrow width of distribution, sigma, of less than 10 and typically less than 5sub. Furthermorc, such particles are in relatively spherical form. Also, there is a great deal of flexibility in the ability to produce a median diameter of the desired size. This is particularly important with respect to the capability of forming extremely small particles. For example, as set forth in the 087 patent and in U.S. Patent No. 4,376,047, there are major advantages in effectiveness of ion chromatography by using layering particles of relatively small size. By the use of the latex procedure, the layering particle may have a median diameter below 1 micron, or even 0.1 micron or less, to as low as 0.002 micron or less. As used herein, the term median diameter is defined in the 460 patent. The latex procedure is to be contrasted with formation of small particles by grinding which cannot form particles in the low end of this size range.The most common form of strong acid cation exchange functional group is sulfonate, and so the present description will refer to such sulfonate functional groups. The base polymer for forming such sulfonate groups may be the ones described in the 460 and 087 patents. Preferable ones are poly aromatic and alkylaromatic resins such as cross linked polystyrene and mono, di and trisubstituted alkylpolystyrenes. A preferred cross linking agent is divinylbenzene in a ratio of 0.3 to 13 of the polystyrene. Typical ratios of cross linking agent to polymer are the same for the substrate particles as for the layering particles.A suitable method of forming the cation exchange latex of the present invention is as follows. A monomer phase is formed including the base monomer to be polymerized, typically styrene, and the cross linking agent, divinylbenzene. This monomer phase is mixed with an aqueous phase including water, an appropriate buffer, and a polymerization catalyst. Pre mixed monomer phase is contacted with the aqueous phase to form micelles of monomer phase in a continuous aqueous phase. Polymerization proceeds until the monomer micelles are formed into finely dispersed particles formed of insoluble cross linked resin in the aqueous phase, in the form of a latex.After the above polymerization procedure is completed, a sulfonating agent is added to sulfonate the resin while maintaining the latex in stable form. In this manner, a cation latex of resin particles containing sulfonate cation exchanging sites on their available surfaces is formed.Certain processing conditions have been found to be desirable to maintaining the latex in a stable form, and to forming an ultimate cation exchange pellicular product of effective ion exchange capacity. One such parameter is the choice of the sulfonating agent and its method of addition. Preferable sulfonating agents are sulfuric acid, fuming sulfuric acid, or mixtures thereof. The rate of addition should be relatively sow to avoid precipitation. A preferable procedure is to first add concentrated sulfuric acid e.g., 96 , followed by the addition of fuming sulfuric acid e.g., 30tri sulfur trioxide .Another important parameter of sulfonation is the concentration of water in the mixture during sulfonation. It has been found that effective sulfonation proceeds best when the water content is less than 30 and, preferably, less than 20 . To accomplish this reduction in the initial water content, which is typically in excess of 90 , sufficient fuming sulfuric acid may be added so that the sulfur trioxide reacts with the water and thereby lowers the effective quantity present in the mixtures so that it does not interfere with the sulfonation reaction. To accomplish this objective, suitable effective acid concentrations are on the order of 30 to 130 based on sulfuric acid, and preferably 80 to 100 . With reference to fuming sulfuric acid, effective acid concentration is meant to include the sulfuric acid in the added acid, added to the sulfuric acid which would be formed by the sulfur trioxide in the aqueous mixture.The temperature of polymerization may vary over a wide range, e.g., from 0 to 100 C. A preferable temperature range is 20 80 C, while a most preferable oneis23 600C. The type of surfactant is important to the maintenance of a stable latex. In that regard, while anionic surfactants may be suitable, it has been found that nonionic surfactants are particularly effective In maintaining the stability of the latex.Suitable nonionic surfactants include ethoxylated alkyiphenols, ethoxylated fatty alcohols, alkylphenolated fatty acids and ethoxylated oils. One such surfactant is a nonylphenol 40 mok ethylene oxide adduct nonionic surfactant manufactured by GAF Corporation under the designation Igepal CCL897. After the completion of sulfonation, the latex may be diluted with water or neutralized with an appropriate base such as sodium hydroxide. Thereafter, the latex is contacted with substrate to produce the pellicular resin of the present invent ion.Contact of latex with substrate may be accomplished in a number of different ways. For example, a column may be prepared by packing the substrate particles to which a latex is added as by using pressure packing, a technique described in the 087 patent. Alternatively, the latex particles may be pumped to the substrate particles in a column, with or without pressure. A still further alternative is to mix the substrate particles and latex, as in a beaker.It has been found that the pellicular cation exchange composition formed as set forth above is particularly effective for use as a low capacity ion exchange resin for use in ion chromatography.The pellicular cation exchange resin of the foregoing type is particularly useful as packing material for columns to be used in ion exchange chromatography.There, a mixture of cations is resolved by passing through the column, wherein the different ions are separated due to different degrees of attraction by the cation exchanging sides on the packing material. To remove the ions from the column, an eluent, also attracted by such sites, is passed through the column to drive the ions so that they may be collected for analysis. Such eluents typically are of the same charge as the ion to be resolved, and of a different chemical type.The ion exchange compositions of the present invention are particularly useful for use in high performance low capacity chromatography as described in PatentNo. 4,101,460. A typical minimum ion exchange capacity for the resin is at least 0.01 meq.l8. The range of eluents to be employed, their flow rates and other parameters of the ion exchange chromatography are well known to those skilled in the art. The ability to use the high chromatographic efficiency made possible with the packing described herein for cations is also apparent to a skilled worker in the field.The basic technique for using the cation exchange composition of the present invention for ion chromatography can be found in United States Patent No.3,920,397. As described therein, two ion exchange resin columns are employed in series, followed by a flow through conductivity detector. The first column separates the ions of injected sample by elution of the sample through the column using an electrolyte eluent. In the second column, termed a suppressor, electrical conductivity of the electrolyte in the eluent, but not that of the separated ionic species, is suppressed so that the ionic species can be determined by a conductivity cell. This technique is described, for example, In U. S. PatentNos. 3,897,213, 3,920,397, 3,925,019 and 3,926,339. Thai portion of the separation technique relating to the separation of cations is incorporated herein by reference.An improvement over the ion exchange resin type of suppressor is described in published European patent application 32,770, in which an Ion exchange membrane, preferably in the form of a fiber, is used. The sample and eluent are passed from the chromatographic separation through the fiber with a flowing regenerant at the outside wall of the fiber. The fiber constitutes an ion exchange membrane partitioning the regenerant from the effluent of chromatographic separation. The membrane passes Ions of the same charge as the exchangeable ions and membrane to convert the electrolyte of the eluent to weakly ionized form, followed by the detection of the ions. This type of suppressor is useful in the ion chromatography method of the present invention.A further disclosure of the nature of the invention is provided by the following specific examples of its practice.Example IThis example illustrates the formation of the cation latex of the present invention. A first step, cross link polystyrene latex is formed using the following aqueous and monomer phases.Aqueous Phase Monomer Phase deionized water 93.31 styrene 17.so sodium bicarbonate .84 divinylbenezene 10 potassium persulfate .5 impurities 2.59r Igepal Cm897 5.0516 sodium metabisulfite .35 Monomer phase ratio weight ratio of monomer phase to aqueous phase is 0.25.Procedure The aqueous phase ingredients except sodium bisuflite are dissolved together and heated to 310 C, while purging the bottle with nitrogen. Next, the premixed monomer phase is added. Nitrogen purging is continued for another minute, then sodium bisulfite dissolved in water is added. The reaction mixture is placed in a 310 C water bath and tumbled end for end at about 30 RPM for 48 hours. A styreneldivinylbenzene latex results with particle diameters about 1000 angstroms. The latex is filtered or centrifuged to remove coaggu um. Then, while cooling, 16 g of concentrated, 96 sulfuric acid is added slowly, to 1.83 g of the raw styrene latex. Next, 8.3 g of 30 fuming sulfuric acid, M2So4. SO is added and the acidified latex is heated to 1400 C for 23 minutes. The resulting latex is diluted with water or neutralized with sodium hydroxide and agglomerated with appropriate substrate to produce a media useful for ion exhange chromatography.Example 2This example illustrates the formation of an agglomerate in which a monolayer of the cation particles of the preceding example is attached to substrate particles.The substrate particles are formed by surface amination with a polyvinylbenzylchloride resin with 8 divinyl benzene cross linking at a nominal average diameter of fifteen microns. Amination is performed by first swelling the particles in a suitable solvent, dichlorolomethane. The swelled particles are formed into a slurry with water buffered by sodium carbonate at a pH of 11.3. Then amination proceeds with an appropriate tertiary amine, trimethylamine, in an amount to aminate approximately 3 of the available chloride sites. Such surface aminated particles are packed into a chromatographic column 4mm I.D.by 250 mm long .Dilute sulfonated latex formed as an Example 1 in 20 to 306 sulfuric acid in water is pumped through the packed column wherein the layering particles irreversibly bind in a monolayer to the latex surface. When the substrate particles are fully loaded, additional latex passes through the column unretained.Approximately 3 ml is sufficient to load the column. The end point of loading is determined by observing the effluent and discontinuing pumping when the latex flows through. After loading, the column is flushed with 0.3 molar Cacti2 solution and then 0.1 NHCI to remove excess latex which may be trapped loosely in the column. This column is now ready for use in ion chromatography. Example 3This example illustrates the use of the column of Example 2 for the separation of cations to be detected by ion chromatography. The apparatus employed comprises the above column in series with a packed bed suppressor column sold by Dionex Corporation of Sunnyvale, California under the designation CationicSuppressor Column . The suppressor column is, in turn, connected to a flow through conductivity cell of a conductivity detector also sold by DionexCorporation.The cationic sample comprises 30 microliters of a solution including sodium ion 5 ppm , ammonium ion 3 ppm , and potassium ion 10 ppm . The eluent comprises 0.00S molar HCI aqueous solution at a flow rate of 2 mllminute. The above run produced a chromatogram with three distinct peaks in the sequence of sodium, ammonium, and potassium.
