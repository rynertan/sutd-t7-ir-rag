Particularly preferred members within the thienamycin thienamycin class of compounds are the N formimidoyl and N acetamidoyl derivatives of thienamycin. The crystalline form of N formimidoyl thienamycin, which has recently been described, is also useful in the practice of this invention. An example illustrating a preferred way of making this compound follows ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE N Formimidoyl thienamycin, NFT crystallineStep A. Benzylformimidate hydrochloride A 3 1. three necked flask fitted with an addition funnel, overhead stirrer, and a reflux condenser, was charged with a mixture of benzyl alcohol 125 g., 1.15 mol formamide 51 g., 1.12 mol and anhydrous ether 1200 ml. .The mixture was stirred vigorously at room temperature 20 250C under a nitrogen atmosphere and benzoyl chloride 157 g., 1.12 mol in 50 ml. of anhydrous ether was added dropwise using the addition funnel. The addition required approximately 50 minutes. The reaction mixture was stirred an additional 60 minutes at room temperature. The ether was removed by decantation and 300 ml. of acetic anhydride in 500 ml. of anhydrous ether was added. The mixture was stirred 30 minutes at room temperature.The precipitate was allowed to settle and the etheracetic anhydride was again removed by decantation.The solid was collected by filtration, washed with 500 ml. of ether and dried in vacuo over KOH at 250C for 2 hrs. to give 130 g. 67 of benzylformimidate hydrochloride as a white solid. The product was assayed by NMR g DMSO 5.7 s, 2H, CH2 r 7.5 s, 5H, , 9.0 s, lH, HC N .The product is thermally unstable. It decomposes to formamide and benzyl chloride at OOC and above.However, no appreciable decomposition was detected on storage at 200C for 2 months. Step B. Derivatization of Thienamycin Thienamycin in the form of a 6 1. aqueous solution, pH 6.5, concentrate from the fermentation broth, containing 28 g. thienamycin was placed in a large beaker 12 1 and cooled to OOC. The beaker was equipped with a pH meter and an efficient high speed stirrer. The pH was raised to 8.5 by the careful addition of 3N KOH KOH was added dropwise via syringe to the stirred solution . The solution was treated with 6 equivalents of solid benzyl formimidate hydrochloride r l00 g. in portions while maintaining the pH at 8.5 0.3 by the addition of 3N KOH 200 ml. using a syringe. The addition required 3 5 min. The reaction mixture was stirred for 6 min. at 0 C and then assayed by liquid chromatography to insure completion of the reaction.The solution was adjusted to pH 7 with lN HCl. The volume of the reaction mixture was measured, and the solution was assayed by UV. The neutralized reaction mixture was concentrated to 15 g. l. on the reverse osmosis unit at l00C. The volume of the concentrate was measured and the pH was adjusted to 7.2 7.4, if necessary. The concentrate was filtered through a medium porosity sintered glass funnel to remove any solids present after concentrate tion. Step C. Dowex 50W x 2 Chromatography The concentrate 750 1000 ml., 15 20 g. was applied to OOC. to a precooled 18 1. column ofDowex 50W x 2 in the potassium cycle 200 400 mesh resin and the column was eluted at 0 5 C with distilled deionized water a flow rate of 90 ml min. and a head pressure of 0 45 psig.

METHODS OF USING THE INVENTION As mentioned above, the thienamycin type compound is used in combination with the dipeptidase inhibitor. The combination of the novel chemical inhibitors of this inventiofl and the thienamycin class compound can be in the form of a pharmaceutical composition containing the two compounds in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The two can be employed in amounts so that the weight ratio of the thienamycin class compound to inhibitor is 1 3 to 30 1, and preferably 1 1 to 5 1. The components can also be separately administered. For instance, the thienamycin class compound can be administered intramuscularly or intravenously in amounts of 1 100 mg kg day, preferably 1 20 mg kg day, or 1 5 mg kg day, in divided dosage forms, e.g., three or four times a day. The inhibitor can be separately administered, orally, intramuscularly, or IV, in amounts of 1100 mg kg day, or preferably 1 30 mg kg day, or 1 5 mg kg day. The amounts of the two components administered during one day ideally are within the ratio limits denoted above. One preferred dosage form known to applicants is as a single dose, of two crystalline compounds, one being N formimidoyl thienamycin and the other being Z 2 282 dimethylcyclopropanecarboxamido 2 octenoic acid, co administered in a sterile aqueous IV injection form sodium salt , at a level of 150 mg. of the thienamycin and either 75 or 150 mg of the octenoic acid. This dose is given to humans each assumed to weigh about 80 kg. from 1 to 4 times a day, or 2 8 mg kg day of the thienamycin class compound and 1 8 mg kg day of the inhibitor. The most preferred dosage regimen and level is the combination of crystalline N formimidoyl thienamycin and the other being the crystalline form of 7 L amino 2 carboxyethylthio 2 2 ,2 dimethylcyclopropanecarb oxamido 2 heptenoic acid, co administered in a sterile aqueous IV injection form sodium salt , at a level of 250 or 500 mg of the thienamycin and about 1 1 weight of the heptenoic acid, or 250 or 500 mg. This dose is given to humans each assumed to weigh about 80 kg. from 1 to 4 times daily, or 3.1 25 mg kg day of each drug. The components, whether administered separately or together are employed in pharmaceutically acceptable carriers such as conventional vehicles adapted for oral adminstration such as capsules, tablets, or liquid solutions or suspensions. The components separately or together, can also be dissolved in a vehicle adapted for administration by injection. Suitable formulations for oral use, may include diluents, granulating agents, preservatives, binders, flavoring agents, and coating agents. The example of an oral use composition in the combination of active ingredients, or the acid component alone, intermixed in the dry pulverulent state with gelatin, starch, magnesium stearate, and alginic acid, and pressed into a tablet. As noted above, the presently known preferred method is parenteral administration of the thienamycin class compound and either co parenteral administration or oral administration of the inhibitor compound. METHODS OF TESTING THE COMBINATION ANTIBACTE RI AL AGENT As noted, disposition studies with thienamycin, its natural analogs and its semi synthetic derivatives have revealed a major metabolic degradation pathway of elimination in the various species examined mouse, rat, dog, chimpanzee, Rhesus monkey . The extent of metabolism is reflected in low urinary recovery and short plasma half lives.The nature of this degradation was demonstrated to be lactam cleavage by the renal dipeptidase E.C.3.4.13.11 , described first by Bergmann, M.and Schleich, H., Z. Physiol. Chem., 205 65 1932 see also Greenstein, J.P., Advances in Enzymology,Vol. VIII, Wiley Interscience, 1948 , New York, and Campbell, B.J. Lin, Y C., Davis, R.V. andBallew, E., The Purification and Properties ofParticulate Renal Dipeptidase , Biochim. Biophys.Acta., 118, 371 1966 . In order to demonstrate the ability of the compounds of Formula I to suppress the action of the renal dipeptidase enzyme, an in vitro screen procedure was followed. This measured the ability of compounds to inhibit hydrolysis of glycyldehydrophenylalanine GDP by a solubilized preparation of dipeptidase isolated from hog kidneys. The procedure is as follows to a 1 ml. system containing 50 mM MOPS 3 N morpholino propanesulfonic acid buffer, pH 7.1, is added 5pg of lyophilized enzyme, and the test compound at a final concentration of 0.1 mM. After a five minute incubation at 370C, GDP is added to a final concentration of 0.05mM. Incuba tion is continued for 10 minutes, at 37tC and hydrolysis of GDP is measured by the change in optical density with time at 275 nm.Inhibit ion of the enzyme is gauged by comparison to a standard run containing no inhibitor and is expressed as the inhibitor binding constant, Ki. This is the concentration of the inhibitor which achieves 50 inhibition of enzyme. The substrate GDP is employed in preference to thienamycin in this screen because it has a much higher maximal velocity of hydrolysis by renal dipeptidase, thereby reducing the amount of enzyme required. Both GDP and thienamycinyhave a similar affinity for renal dipeptidase furthermore, Ki s of inhibitors tested have been identical for the two substrates. In addition to this in vitro screen procedure, an in vivo screen was followed to measure the test compound 5 ability to inhibit metabolism as reflected by increase in urinary recovery of thienamycin from the mouse. The procedure involves co administration of the test compound by the intravenous or subcutaneous route at a dose rate of 10 100 mg kg, with 10 mg kg thienamycin. Thienamycin recovery in the urine over a 4 hour period is then compared with its recovery in a control group to which test compound was not co administered. Urinary recovery of thienamycin was measured in all cases with the use of a cylinder or disc diffusion assay, conducted in a manner described inU.S. Patent 3,950,357. This bioassay, with Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 as the test organism, has a useful response range from 0.04 Fg ml to 3.0 Wg ml. Examples which illustrate this invention follow.SECTION 1. EXAMPLES ILLUSTRATING ACTIVITYIn Vitro Test Data A 1 ml. system of 50 mM MOPS buffer, pH 7.1, is used. To this is added 5Rg of the pig renal enzyme and an amount of the test compound to bring its final concentration to 0.1 mM. After a five minute incubation at 370C, an amount of GDP is added to bring its final concentration to 0.05 mM. The system is again incubated for 10 minutes, at 370C. Hydrolysis of GDP is measured by its change in optical density with time at 275 nm. Inhibition of the enzyme is gauged by comparison to a standard run containing no inhibitor and is presented as percent inhibition. The K. is a constant indicating the concentration of inhibitor necessary to produce 50 inhibition of enzyme. It is a calculated value obtained from running multiple in vitro as says, as above, at concentrations resulting in inhibition below and above the 50 inhibition point.

EXAMPLES ILLUSTRATING CHEMICAL PREPARATIONS The inhibitor compounds are made by condensing directly the appropriate 2 keto acid or ester and an amide EMI17.1 wherein R2 and R3 are as defined, and R is hydrogen or alkyl. The general reaction conditions involve mixing approximately 1 4 1 parts of the acid to the amide in an inert solvent such as toluene or methyl isovalerate and heating at reflux with azeotropic removal of water for from 3 48 hours, preferably 5 2 4 hours. The solution when cooled normally yields the product in crystalline form, but the product can also be isolated using a base extraction process.The product can be recrystallized by using generally known techniques. Condensations of keto esters require use of small amount of p toluenesulfonic acid as catalyst. The catalyst also is helpful in some condensations with keto acids. Another route to the novel inhibitor compounds uses an a amino acid, t butyl ester in reaction with an acid chloride EMI17.2 This reaction takes place in the presence of base, such as triethylamine, in a solvent such as methylene chloride. The resulting N acylated product VII is then oxidized by treatment with t butyl hypochlorite followed by addition of sodium methoxide.This yields the 2 methoxy derivative VIII and or its elimination product, the a,ss unsaturated ester IX . Further treatment with anhydrous hydrochloric acid converts either VIII or IX or the mixture of both to the desired a, unsaturated free acid II . EMI18.1 EMI18.2 Some compounds wherein R3 has a terminal substituent which is an amino, quaternary nitrogen, thio derivative, alkoxy, guanidino, acyloxy or cyano can be made most conveniently from an intermediate having a terminal bromine. In this case, the bromo or chloro intermediate has the structureEMI18.3 wherein n is the number of carbons in the desired hydrocarbon chain e.g., from 3 7 . In order to prepare R3 having a terminal trimethylammonium substituent, the bromo intermediate is reacted with trimethylamine to yield the amino the bromo intermediate is reacted with ammonia the guanidino, reaction is with guanidine to prepare the thio derivatives, including 2 amino 2 carboxyethylthio, the bromo compound is reacted with cysteine Hel, or the appropriate mercaptan.Derivatized amino, such as formamidino, ureido, and acylamido acetamido can be made from the compounds having an amino group by reacting with o benzyl formimidate HCl, potassium cyanate and the appropriate acyl anhydride acetic dehydride , respectively. Another route for preparing compounds when R3 is a terminally substituted thio derivative utilizes a chloro keto ester intermediateEMI19.1 in reaction with the desired amide,EMI19.2 in toluene at reflux in the presence of a catalytic amount of p toluene sulfonic acid. The resulting intermediate is hydrolyzed to the acid the chloro group is then displaced in reaction with the appropriate mercaptan.This reaction is valuable since it permits use of the chiral amide IV, thereby preparing a functionalized side chain. In addition, the mixture of Z E isomers prepared after the mercaptan condensation can be directly isomerized into the Z form by adding acid to a pH about 3, and heating to about 90 C for 30 minutes. Only the Z form remains, and recovery is simple and straight forward.More detail about preparation of the compounds is found in the following examples. EXAMPLE 1 Z 8 Brorno 2 2, 2 Dimethylcyclopropanecarboxamido 2 octenoic acid To a suspension of 14.4 g 0.3 mole of 50 NaH dispersion in 360 ml of toluene cooled in an ice bath and in a N2 atmosphere was added over 45 min. a solution of 146 g 0.6 moles of 1,6dibromohexane and 57.6 g 0.3 mole of ethyl 1,3dithiane 2 carboxylate in 120 ml of DMF. The cooling bath was removed and the mixture stirred at room temperature for 20 hrs. The reaction mixture was washed with water 3 x 210 ml , dried over MgSO4 and evaporated under reduced pressure to give 179.5 g of a yellow oil containing the desired alkylated dithiane, 1,6 dibromohexane and mineral oil. This crude material was used in the next reaction without purification. To a suspension of 426 g 2.4 moles ofN bromosuccinamide in 800 ml of acetonitrile and 200 ml of H20 was added over 45 min. a solution of the crude dithiane in 100 ml of acetonitrile. The temperature of the reaction mixture was maintained below 250C with an ce bath. After stirring at 200C for 10 min. the dark red reaction mixture was poured into 2 1. of hexane CH2Cl2 l l . The solution was shaken with saturated NaHSO3 2 x 400 ml and water 1 x 500 ml . Then 400 ml of saturatedNa2CO3 solution was added in small portions vigorous CO2 solution . After the foaming subsided the funnel was shaken and the aqueous phase separated. The organic layer was extracted with saturated Na2CO3 solution 400 ml and water 500 ml and dried over MgSO4.
