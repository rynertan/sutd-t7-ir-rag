# SYNERGISTIC COMPOSITIONS OF NALBUPHINE AND NON NARCOTIC ANALGESIC COMPOUNDS

## Abstract
Pharmaceutical compositions of nalbuphine and non narcotic analgesic compounds such as ibuprofen, zomepirac, indomethacin, tiflamizole, sulindac, and flurbiprofen have been found to exhibit unexpectedly enhanced analgesic activity by applying an analysis model which considers data characterizing the analgesic effect of both the pure compo nents as well as the fixed dose ratio combinations. This synergism enables the use of lower doses of either or both drugs with a concomitant reduction in risk of possible side effects.
