## Description
The present invention relates to a magneto optical memory medium which is formed with a plurality of magneto optical data storage layers, to improve the density of information stored per unit area of the medium. The invention also relates to a magneto optical apparatus for writing information on selected one of the storage layers of such a magneto optical memory medium, and a magneto optical apparatus for reading information from the selected storage layer. There is known a magneto optical recording and reproduction apparatus for recording or writing information on a magneto optical material which has a self magnetizing property and through which a beam of light may be transmitted. The information is written by means of local magnetization of the magneto optical material in one of opposite directions normal to the surface of the magneto optical material. The written information on the magneto optical memory medium is read out or reproduced by utilizing a magneto optical effect. A commonly used magneto optical memory medium for information storage comprises a thin data storage layer of a magneto optical material formed on a substrate layer made of an acrylic resin, glass or other suitable material. A magneto optical medium of such a laminar structure in the form of a disk is generally known as a magneto optical disk. The data storage capacity of such a known magneto optical memory medium, i.e., the number of data bits recordable on the memory medium, is determined by the size of a spot of a light beam used for information recording or reproduction. Since the size of the beam spot is closely related to the wavelength of the light beam, the number of data bits per unit area of the memory medium is limited by the wavelength of the beam of light used. Thus, the density of information stored on the known memory medium has a limitation in relation to the wavelength of the light beam. In the meantime, a magneto optical memory medium has a limitation in its size, due to increasing tendencies of deformation of its substrate layer and dimensional errors of the medium as the size is increased. For example, the maximum permissible diameter of a magneto optical disk is 30 cm. As indicated above, the known magneto optical memory medium suffers a limitation in its memory capacity. WO A 8,402,603 EP A 128 960 discloses a magneto optical recording medium with a laminar structure comprising two magneto optic layers with a non magnetic layer sandwiched between them and a metal or semi metal film backing. Information may be recorded on the two magneto optical layers using two lasers of different frequency. The present invention was developed in view of the aforementioned background of the related art. It is therefore a first aim of the invention to provide a magneto optical memory medium which has a considerably increased density of information recordable thereon. A second aim of the present invention is the provision of a magneto optical apparatus suitable for recording information on such a memory medium. A third aim of the invention is to provide a magneto optical apparatus suitable for reading out information from the memory medium. According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a magneto optical memory medium, consisting of a laminar structure comprising The magneto optical memory medium of the invention constructed as described above is capable of storing information on each of the plurality of magneto optical layers which are separated from each other by the appropriate non magnetic layer, whereby the amount of information recordable per unit area is increased. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, each of the magneto optical storage layers consists of a first magneto optical film having a comparatively low Curie point, and a second magneto optical film having a comparatively high magneto optical effect. This arrangement is advantageous in that information is easily written on the first magneto optical layer with the low Curie point, and the recorded information on the first layer is read out from the second magneto optical layer magnetically connected to the first magneto optical layer, with relatively high reliability of information reproduction thanks to the comparatively high magneto optical effect of the second layer. In accordance with a further advantageous embodiment of the invention, the plurality of magneto optical storage layers have different Curie points, so that information may be written on desired one of the plurality of storage layers by changing an intensity of a light beam incident to the memory medium. According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a magneto optical apparatus for recording information on a magneto optical memory medium, the apparatus comprising In the magneto optical recording apparatus of the second aspect of the invention, the laser beam emitted from the laser device is converged on the selected one of the plural storage layers of the memory medium, whereby a spot of the selected storage layer is heated by the laser beam. Accordingly, after the heated spot has been cooled, information may be written on the spot by generating a magnetic field to magnetize the spot in one of opposite directions normal to the surface of the selected storage layer. Since the laser beam is converged on the selected storage layer only, i.e., the laser beam is not converged on the other storage layers, the corresponding spots of the other storage layers will not be heated by the laser beam, and consequently the information stored thereon will not be erased for writing of new information. In the second aspect, the laser device may comprise an object lens having a depth of focus which is smaller than a thickness of each of the at least one non magnetic layer of the memory medium. This arrangement makes it possible to heat only the selected storage layer, without affecting the information stored on the other storage layers. According to a third aspect of the present invention, there is provided a magneto optical apparatus for recording information on a magneto optical memory medium, comprising In the third aspect, a difference in Curie point Curie temperature of the different storage layers permits easy writing of information on the desired one of the storage layers by adjusting the intensity of the laser beam, even if the plural storage layers are disposed in relatively close relation with each other. In the above case, it is preferred to reduce the intensity of the laser beam successively so as to write information on the storage layers, in the order of the Curie point, beginning with the storage layer having the highest Curie point. In this case, the information may be written only on the selected storage layer without reducing the depth of focus of the laser beam, or increasing the thickness of each non magnetic layer which separates the magneto optical storage layers from each other. According to a fourth aspect of the invention, there is provided a magneto optical apparatus for recording information on a magneto optical memory medium which consists of a laminar structure including a plurality of magneto optical storage layers having different Curie points, and at least one non magnetic layer each of which is interposed between adjacent two layers of said plurality of magneto optical storage layers, said apparatus comprising In the above apparatus, the change of the laser beam of a wavelength corresponding to the selected storage layer of the memory medium is obtained as a change in the Kerr rotation angle of the corresponding laser beam in relation to the direction of magnetization magneto optical anisotropy of the selected storage layer, irrespective of the direction of magnetisation of the other storage layers. Thus, the information recorded on the individual storage layers may be retrieved by detecting the changes in the Kerr rotation angles of the laser beams having the different wavelengths corresponding to the storage layers. The magneto optical apparatus of the fourth aspect may further comprise The foregoing and optional aims, features and advantages of the present invention will be better understood from reading the following detailed description of several exemplary embodiments of the invention, when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which The invention will be described in detail by reference to the accompanying drawing showing preferred embodiments of the invention. Referring first to Fig. 1, there is generally shown at 11 an embodiment of a magneto optical apparatus of the invention for reading information from a magneto optical memory medium of the invention in the form of a magneto optical memory disk 10. The mangeto optical memory disk 10 consists of a laminar structure comprising a non magnetic layer 14, a first magneto optical storage layer 16, an intermediate non magnetic layer 18, a second magneto optical storage layer 20, another non magnetic layer 22 and a reflector layer 24, which are formed in this order on one surface of a transparent substrate layer 12, with vapor deposition, sputtering or other suitable known methods. The transparent substrate layer 12 may be formed of a glass material, transparent resin, or other suitable transparent material. In this specific embodiment, the substrate layer 12 is made of an acrylic resin such as polymethyl methacrylate PMMA . The use of acrylic resins for the substrate layer 12 facilitates the manufacture of the memory disk 10, and permits easy handling of the same. The non magnetic layers 14, 22 are provided to protect the first and second thin magneto optical storage layers 16 and 20, and are formed of a transparent non magnetic or dielectric material such as aluminum nitride AlN , silicon oxide SiO , silicon dioxide SiO₂ , or metallic silicon Si . More specifically, the non magnetic layers 14, 22 protect the first and second storage layers 16, 20 from their chemical change oxidation, etc. , and have thicknesses of about 1421Å 0,1421 µm and 1336Å 0,1336 µm , respectively. However, these non magnetic layers 14, 22 may be eliminated if a chemical change of the first and second storage layers 16, 20 is hardly anticipated. The first and second storage magneto optical layers 16, 20 are separated by the intermediate non magnetic layer 18, and the laminar structure of these three layers 16, 18, 20 are sandwiched by the non magnetic layers 14, 22. The first magneto optical storage layer 16 has a thickness of about 110Å 0,011 µm , and the second magneto optical storage layer 20 has a thickness of about 800Å 0,08 µm , while the intermediate non magnetic layer 18 has a thickness of about 17830Å 1,783 µm . The first and second storage layers 16, 20 are formed of magneto optical materials having an excellent magneto optical effect. For example, the storage layers 16, 20 may be formed of amorphous GdTbFe, TbFe, TbFeCo, GdCo or GdDyFe, polycrystalline MnCuBi, monocrystalline TbFeO₃, or rare earth iron garnet. In this embodiment, the storage layers 16, 20 are made of GdTbFe. The intermediate non magnetic layer 18 is made of a translucent non magnetic or dielectric material as used for the non magnetix layer 14. The layer 18 may be a liminar structure consisting of a plurality of translucent non magnetic films. This laminar structure is preferred for easy formation of the non magnetic layer 18 with a large thickness. For instance, the laminar non magnetic layer 18 may be formed by alternate films of SiO₂ and SiO. The reflector layer 24 is made of various materials which reflect light, typically a layer of aluminum formed by vapor deposition. However, the non magnetic layer 22 and the reflector layer 24 may be replaced by a plastic layer having a large thickness. A relatively thick plastic layer may serve to sufficiently reflect incident light at its interface with the magneto optical storage layer 20, and may function at the same time to protect the storage layer 20 from oxidation. The magneto optical memory disk 10 is rotated by a driving device not shwon about its axis which is oriented vertically, for example. In the meantime, the magneto optical reading apparatus 11 has an optical system including an object lens 38. The optical system is adapted to be movable relative to the memory disk 10 in a horizontal plane and in a radial direction of the memory disk 10, so that a beam of light incident to the memory disk 10 for information reproduction may be moved in the radial direction of the disk 10. The optical system further includes first and second laser light sources 26 and 28 which emit laser beams of different wavelengths in the form of linearly polarized light, such that the laser beams are directed to a dichroic mirror 34 through collimator lenses 30, 32, respectively. In the present embodiment, the laser beam hereinafter referred to as first laser beam produced by the first laser light source 26 has a wavelength λ1 of 8300Å 0,83 µm , while the laser beam hereinafter called second laser beam of the second laser light source 28 has a wavelength λ2 of 7800Å 0,78 µm . The dichroic mirror 34 permits the first laser beam of the wavelength λ1 to pass therethrough, and reflects the second laser beam of the wavelength λ2. The composite laser of the wavelengths λ1 and λ2 from the dichoric mirror 34 is transmitted through a half mirror 36 and the object lens 38 positioned opposite to the memory disk 10, whereby the composite laser beam is incident to the memory disk 10. As indicated above, the optical system includes the laser light sources 26, 28, collimator lenses 30, 32, dichroic mirror 34 and object lens 38, which cooperate with each other to apply laser beams to the magneto optical memory disk 10 for reading information therefrom. The composite laser beam incident to the memory disk 10 is reflected by the reflector layer 24, and transmitted to a dichroic mirror 40 through the object lens 38 and the half mirror 36. The dichoric mirror 40 permits the first laser beam to pass therethrough, and reflects the second laser beam, whereby the composite laser beam from the half mirror 36 is separated. The first and second laser beams of the wavelengths λ1 and λ2 are received by a first and a second detecting device 42, 44, respectively. The first and second detecting devices 42, 44 detect angles of the Kerr rotation of the first and second laser beams of the different wavelengths λ1, and λ2, respectively. The Kerr rotation angles of the first and second laser beams λ1, λ2 are changed depending upon the magneto optical anisotropy or the direction of magnetization of the parts of the first and second magneto optical storage layers 16, 20 which are exposed to the laser beams. Therefore, by detecting the Kerr rotation angle of the first or second laser beam, it is possible to reproduce the information which has been recorded in the first or second storage layer 16, 20 by means of magnetization of each memory location thereof in one of opposite directions perpendicular to the surface of the memory disk 10. Thus, the object lens 38, half mirror 36, dichroic mirror 40, first detecting device 42, and second detecting device 44, cooperate to constitute a detecting device for detecting angles of the Kerr rotation of the first and second laser beams. The detecting devices 42, 44 are identically constructed. By way of example, the first detecting device 42 is illustrated in Fig. 2, whrein the first laser beam of the wavelength λ1 reflected by the memory disk 10 is split by a half mirror 46 into two beams one of which is received by a photodiode 52 through an analyzer 48, and the other of which is received by a photodiode 54 through an analyzer 50. The analyzers 48 and 50 have planes of polarization which are perpendicular to each other, and are inclined 45 degrees with respect to a plane of polarization of the incident laser beams. Accordingly, the rotation of the polarization plane of the first laser beam will cause, for example, an increase in the amount of light received by the photodiode 52, and a decrease in the amount of light received by the photodiode 54. Outputs of the photodiodes 52, 54 are applied to corresponding inputs of a differential amplifier 56, which provides an output representative of the information stored on the first magneto optical storage layer 16. This differential amplifier 56 eliminates noises due to output variations of the laser light sources 26, 28. While the present embodiment uses the laser light sources 26, 28 of semiconductor or external resonance type for producing linearly polarized laser beams, it is possible to use laser sources of internal resonance type which produce circularly polarized light. In this case, the laser beams emitted from the laser sources are applied through a polarizer. The operation of the instant magneto optical reading apparatus 11 will be described. The information stored in the first storage layer 16 of the memory disk 10, and the information stored in the second storage layer 20 spaced from the first storage layer 16 by the intermediate non magnetic layer 18, are read out independently of each other. For reading the information from the first storage layer 16 independently of the information stored in the second storage layer 20, an amount of change in the Kerr rotation angle of the first laser beam should represent the direction of magnetization N or S of the fisrt storage layer 16 as indicated at a and b in Fig. 3, irrespective of the direction of magnetization of the second storage layer 20. Similarly, an amount of change in the Kerr rotation angle of the second laser beam should represent the direction of magnetization N or S of the second storage layer 20 as indicated at a and b in Fig. 4, irrespective of the direction of magnetization of the first storage layer 16. Through extensive research and investigations, the inventor of the present invention has obtained the following findings in connection with an amount of change or difference in the Kerr rotation angle of each of the first and second laser beams of the different wavelengths λ1 and λ2, depending upon the four possible combinations of the magnetization directions of the first and second magneto optical storage layers 16, 20. More specifically stated, it was found that the Kerr rotation angles of the four combinations with respect to each other are changed differently as the thickness of one of the first and second storage layers 16, 20 is changed. In addition, it was found that when the above one storage layer 16, 20 is given a specific thickness, the amount of change of the Kerr rotation angles of the four combinations with respect to each other represents the direction of magnetization of each one of the first and second storage layers 16, 20, irrespective of the direction of magnetization of the other storage layer 20, 16. The principle of the present invention is based on the above findings. Described in greater detail, a simulation conducted by the inventor revealed characteristics curves of the first laser beam wavelength λ1 8300Å 0,83 µm as shown in Fig. 5. The curves show differences in the Kerr rotation angle of the four combinations N S, N N, S N and S S of the magnetization directions of the first and second storage layers 16, 20, relative to each other. The curves N S and N N indicate the cases where the first storage layer 16 is magnetized in the N direction, while the second storage layer 20 is magnetized in the S and N directions, respectively. The curves S N and S S indicate the cases where the first storage layer 16 is magnetized in the S direction, while the second storage layer 20 is magnetized in the N and S directions, respectively. As indicated in the figure, an amount of change in the Kerr rotation angle of the first laser beam among the four combinations N S, N N, S N, S S relative to each other distinctly represents the magnetizating direction of the first storage layer 16, irrespective of the magnetizating direction of the second storage layer 20, if the first storage layer 16 has a thickness in the neighbourhood of 100Å 0,01 µm . For example, the Kerr roation angle is changed by an approximate amount of 0.6 degrees δϑ k when the magnetizating direction of the first storage layer 16 is changed from S to N, regardless of whether the second storage layer 20 is magnetized in the N or S direction. Similarly, the simulation revealed characteristics curves of the second laser beam wavelength λ2 7800Å 0,78 µm as shown in Fig. 6. As indicated in the figure, an amount of change in the Kerr rotation angle of the second laser beam among the four combinations N S, N N, S N, S S relative to each other distinctly represents the magnetizating direction of the second storage layer 20, irrespective of the magnetizating direction of the first storage layer 16, if the first storage layer 16 has a thickness in the neighbourhood of 120Å. As previously indicated, the first magneto optical storage layer 16 of the memory disk 10 has a thickness of 100Å 0,01 µm . Accordingly, a difference or change in the Kerr rotation angle of the first laser beam reflected by the memory disk 10, which is obtained due to the magneto optical anisotropy N or S of the first storage layer 16, identifies one of the opposite magnetizating directions N or S of the first storage layer 16, with a sufficiently high level of distinction. Therefore, the detection of the Kerr rotation angle of the first storage layer 16 by the first detecting device 42 enables the reading apparatus 11 to provide an output signal which indicates the information N or S stored on a part of the first storage layer 16 to which the first laser beam is incident. In the same manner, a change in the Kerr rotation angle of the second laser beam reflected by the disk 10 permits reliable identification of the magnetizating direction of the second storage layer 20, and the detection of the Kerr rotation angle of the second storage layer 20 by the second detecting device 44 enables the reading apparatus 11 to provide an output signal indicative of the information stored on the corresponding part of the second storage layer 20. As described hitherto, the instant magneto optical reading apparatus 11 is capable of reading out information selectively from the first and second magneto optical storage layers 16, 20, as needed. Hence, the density of information recordable on the memory disk 10, i.e., the amount of information that can be stored on the memory disk 10, is almost doubled, as compared with that of a known magneto optical disk having a single storage layer. This is a drastic increase in the memory capacity of the disk. The aforementioned simulation which demonstrated the characteristics of Figs. 5 and 6, was conducted based on Equation 1 indicated below. Equation 1 is obtained by using Maxwell s electromagnetic equations. Conditions of each of the layers of the magneto optical memory disk 10 are applied to the Maxwell s equations to obtain relations between incident and reflected light beams when linearly polarlized light is incident to the memory disk 10. Based on these obtained relations, an angle of the Kerr rotation of the reflected light beam is expressed by Equation 1 , provided an electric field strength of the reflected light beam consists of a component Ey having the a polarization plane parallel to that of the incident light beam, and a component Ex having a polarization plane perpendicular to that of the reflected light beam. In this connection, it is noted that the relative amount of change δϑk of Figs. 5 and 6 is expressed as a difference from the minimum value of the four values of the Kerr rotation angle , since the angle is changed depending upon the directions of magnetization of the first and second storage layers 16, 20. Assuming b₁₁ and b₂₁ are expressed as complex numbers indicated by Equations 5 and 6 , the components Ex and Ey of the electric field strength are expressed by Equations 7 and 8 The characteristic curves shown in Figs. 5 and 6 are obtained where the first storage layer 16 of the memory disk 10 is formed of GdTbFe. If other materials are used for the first storage layer 16, the characteristic relations between the Kerr rotation angles of the first and second laser beams and the thickness of the first storage layer 16 will be obviously changed accordingly. Therefore, it will be understood that the optimum thickness of the first storage layer 16 of the memory disk 10 must be changed accordingly. Although the instant embodiment uses the first storage layer 16 as a layer whose thickness is determined according to the concept of the invention, it is possible that the thickness of the second storage layer 20 is determined so as to permit reliable detection of the magnetization directions of the layers 16, 20 based on the amount of change in the Kerr rotation angles. The magneto optical memory disk 10 may comprise three or more magneto optical storage layers, as illustrated in Fig. 7 wherein a second intermediate non magnetic layer 58 and a third magneto optical storage layer 60 are interposed between the second storage layer 20 and the non magnetic layer 22. In this instance, three laser beams of different wavelengths are necessary to read out information from selected one of the three magneto optical storage layers 16, 20 and 60. Apparently, the memory disk 10 of Fig. 7 has a memory capacity about three times as large as a conventional memory disk with a single storage layer. Further, each of the storage layers 16, 20 of the memory disk 10 may consists of a plurality of magneto optical films superposed in direct contact with each other without a non magnetic layer interposed therebetween. For example, each of the storage layers 16, 20 consists of a GdFe film 62 and a TbFe film 64, as illustrated in Fig. 8. The TbFe film 64 has a comparatively low Curie point, so that information may be written with a relatively low level of electric power. The GdFe film 62 which is magnetically connected to the TbFe film 64, has a comparatively large magneto optical effect, which therefore permits easier writing and reading of information on and from the storage layer 16, 20. The illustrated memory medium 10 in the form of a disk may be replaced by a magneto optical memory medium of other shapes such as a tape or drum. In the illustrated embodiment, the two laser light sources 26, 28 are provided for producing the first and second laser beams of different wavelengths λ1 and λ2. However, It is possible to use a semiconductor laser array, argon laser device or other light source devices which generate beams of different wavelengths, or a chromatic light source emitting a light beam of a variable wavelength. In this case, the information reproduction may be accomplished with a single light source, or a plurality of light sources which is smaller in number than the magneto optical storage layers of the memory disk 10. While the wavelengths λ1 and λ2 of the first and second laser beams produced by the laser light sources 26, 28 are 8300Å 0,83 µm and 7800Å 0,78 µm , respectively, which are readily obtainable with a commercially available semiconductor laser element, it will be understood that the wavelengths of the laser beams of the light sources 26, 28 may be changed as desired. In the illustrated embodiment, the first and second laser beams of the wavelengths λ1 and λ2 are used corresponding to the first and second storage layers 16, 20, so that the information stored on these layers 16, 20 may be read out by detecting amounts of change in the Kerr rotation angle of the first and second laser beams, respectively. However, the information may be reproduced, for example, by obtaining a signal representative of a sum of changes of the Kerr rotation angles of the first and second laser beams λ1 and λ2 incident to the first and second storage layers 16, 20, and a signal representative of a difference between these changes of the Kerr rotation angles, and processing these signals to detect the information stored on the first and second storage layers 16, 20. There will next be described an embodiment of a magneto optical recording apparatus for writing information selectively on the first and second storage layers 16, 20 of the memory disk 10. In the following description, the same reference numerals used in the preceding description will be used to identify the corresponding elements. In the interest of brevity and simplification, repeated description of these elements will not be provided. Referring to Fig. 9, the recording apparatus comprises a laser light source 66 which includes a collimator lens and produces a laser beam. The laser beam is directed to the memory disk 10 through an object lens 70 which is supported at one end of an object lens sleeve 68. The apparatus further comprises a frame 67 which carries a positioning mechanism 69 for positioning the object lens sleeve 68 relative to the memory disk 10. The sleeve 68 carries a drive coil 71 wound in the form of a ring, so that the sleeve 68 is movable with an electromagnetic force of the coil 71 between a first position near the memory disk 10, and a second position remote from the memory disk 10. More particularly, the sleeve 68 is supported by the frame 67 through sheet springs 73, so that the sleeve 68 is movable along an optical axis of the object lens 70 in the vertical direction of Fig. 9 , relative to the frame 67. To the frame 67 are attached an annular permanent magnet 75, and yoke members 77, 79, such that the coil 71 on the sleeve 68 is located in a magnetic field produced between the two yoke members 77, 79. With the coil 71 energized, the object lens 70 is moved to a position corresponding to an amount of an electric current applied to the coil 71. Thus, the positioning mechanism 69 serves as positioning means for positioning the object lens 70 relative to the memory disk 10 so that the laser beam produced by the laser light source 66 is converged selectively on the first and second storage layers 16, 20. In other words, the positioning mechanism 69 serves as selector means for positioning a focal point of the laser beam on selected one of the storage layers 16, 20. The object lens 70 has a depth of focus δf which is smaller than the thickness 17830Å 1,783 µm of the intermediate non magentic layer 18 of the magneto optical memory disk 10. It is known that the depth of focus δf of the object lens 70 is given by Equation 19 Upon energization of the coil 71, the object lens 70 is moved to the second postion remote from the memory disk 10 as shown in Fig. 10, the laser beam from the light source 66 is converged on a part of the first storage layer 16 of the memory disk 10. Accordingly, the information recorded on the heated part is erased, and new information may be written thereon, in the same manner as described previously. In this case, too, the laser beam for erasing the information on the first storage layer 16 passes through the second storage layer 20. However, the dpeth of focus δf of the object lens 70 which is smaller than the thickness of the intermediate non magnetic layer 18, contributes to preventing the laser beam from heating the corresponding part of the second storage layer 20 to a temperature over its Curie point. Thus, the erasure of the information on the second storage layer 20 is avoided. While the instant recording apparatus is adapted such that the object lens 70 is moved toward and away from the stationary memory disk 10, it is possible that the memory disk 10 is moved with respect to the object lens 70. The linearly polarized light from the light source may be replaced by circularly polarized light, since the laser beam from the light source 66 is used to locally heat the first and second storage layers 16, 20. Further, a monochromic light beam may be substituted for the laser beam from the light source 66. Modified embodiments of a mangeto optical recording apparatus using object lens or lenses 70 will be described, by reference to Figs. 11 14. The recording apparatus of Fig. 11 includes a pair of laser light sources 66, 66, and a pair of object lenses 70, 70 for converging the laser beams from the light sources 66, 66, on the first and second storage layers 16, 20, respectively. These two assemblies of the light source 66 and the object lens 70 are disposed at fixed positions relative to the memory disk 10 in the direction perpendicular to the surface of the memory disk 10. This modified embodiment eliminates a drive device for positioning the object lens 70 and the memory disk 10 relative to each other. Another modified embodiment is shown in Fig. 12, wherein a second laser beam parallel pencil rays from the laser light source 66 is transmitted through a half mirror 76 and the object lens 70, and thus converged on the second storage layer 20. In the meantime, a first laser beam paralle pencil rays of a wavelength shorter than that of the first laser beam is produced by another laser light source 78. The first laser beam is reflected by the half mirror 76 and transmitted through the object lens 70, whereby the first laser beam is converged on the first storage layer 16. That is, the focal length of the object lens 70 is changed by means of chromatic aberration. In the present embodiment, the erasing and writing operations of the first and second storage layers 16, 20 may be effected at the same position as viewed in a plane parallel to the memory disk 10. Another advantage of this embodiment is the elimination of a drive device for positioning the object lens 70 relative to the memory disk 10 along the optical axis of the object lens 70. A further modified embodiment is illustrated in Fig. 13, wherein the object lens 70 is positioned stationary with respect to the memory disk 10 in the direction perpendicular to the memory disk. A pair of laser light sources 80, 82, and a pair of collimator lenses 84, 86 are disposed, so that a first laser beam from the light source 80 is transmitted through the collimator lens 84, a half mirror 88 and the object lens 70 and is converged on the first storage layer 16, while a second laser beam from the light source 82 is transmitted through the collimator lens 86, reflected by the half mirror 88, and converged by the object lens 70 on the second storage layer 20 of the memory disk 10. Namely, the laser light sources 80, 82 and the collimator lenses 84, 86 are so positioned that the first and second laser beams generated by the first and second laser light sources 80, 82 are converged on the first and second storage layers 16, 20 of the memory disk 10, respectively. In the present embodiment, the first and second laser beams may have the same or different wavelengths. In the embodiments of Figs. 11 13, the two laser beams from the two laser light sources are selectively incident to the memory disk 10 according to a currently selected circumferential position of the memory disk 10, i.e., while the memory disk 10 is rotated. To this end, for example, shutters 67 as indicated in Fig. 11 or a power switch 83 may be provided for selective application of the two laser beams to the corresponding first and second storage layers 16, 20. The shutters 67 are associated with the light sources 66, 66 to shut one of the laser beams, for allowing application of only one of the laser beams corresponding to one of the first and second storage layers 16, 20 on which information will be written. The power switch 83 selectively activates one of the first and second laser light sources 80, 82 to emit the corresponding laser beam to one of the storage layers 16, 20. A still further embodiment of a recording apparatus is illustrated in Fig. 14, wherein a collimator lens 90 and the object lens 70 are positioned stationary relative to the memory disk 10 in the direction perpendicular to the disk 10. In this embodiment, a laser light source 92 is adapted to be movable along the optical axis of the object lens 70 so that the laser beam from the light source 92 is converged selectively on the first or second storage layer 16, 20 of the memory disk 10. Described in detail, the light source 92 is attached to a slide 98 which engages a lead screw 96 driven by a stationary drive motor 94. With the screw 96 rotated, the slide 98 is moved parallel to the screw 96, whereby the light source 92 is moved toward or away from the collimator lens 90 and object lens 70, along their optical axes. The slide 98 may be driven by the positioning mechanism 69 of Fig. 9, or by an electrostrictive or magnetostrictive element. While various embodiments of a magneto optical recording apparatus of the invention have been illustrated and described, the information recording on the individual storage layers of a magneto optical memory disk may be effected by a magneto optical apparatus using a conventional object lens with a relatively large depth of focus, by means of selecting the magneto optical material of the storage layers of the memory disk. There is shown in Fig. 15 a magneto optical memory disk 100 which, like the memory disk 10, includes the first and second storage layers 16, 20 separated by the intermediate non magnetic layer 18, the layers 16, 20, 18 being formed on the transparent substrate layer 12. The first and second storage layers 16, 20 are made of magneto optical materials the Curie points of which are different from each other. For example, the first storage layer 16 is made of GdDyFe having a Curie point of about 120 In the apparatus described above, information may be written simultaneously on the first and second storage layers 16, 20 in the following manner. The coil 102 is energized to form a magnetic field in the direction indicated at M in Fig. 15. At the same time, a power source 103 to apply power to the light source 101 is set in its high output position to activate the light source 101, so that the laser beam of high intensity is produced from the light source 101 and directed to the memory disk 100. Consequently, the appropriate parts of the first and second storage layers 16, 20 are heated to a temperature beyond 150 While the present invention has been described by reference to schematic views of the accompanying drawing, it is to be understood that these views are used for illustrating the concept of the invention, and that the invention is not confined to the disclosure of the drawing. While the magneto optical memory disk 10, 100 is partially shown in cross section in the several figures, the thicknesses of the individual layers of the memory disk as shown are determined for easy understanding of the memory disk. Therefore, a proportion of the thicknesses as shown does not represent a proportion of the actual thicknesses. While only the important optical elements are schematically illustrated in Figs. 1, 2, 9 15 and 17, it is possible that the illustrated elements are replaced by other functionally equivalent elements, or used together with other optical elements as needed. Further, the two or more elements such as the lens and half mirror may be provided as a single composite element. As typical modifications, the half mirror 76, 88 may be replaced by a dichroic mirror or a polarizing prism, and the dichoric mirror 34, 40 may be replaced by a combination of a half mirror and a filter. In the latter case, however, the operating efficiency of the optical system is slightly reduced. Although the magneto optical recording and reading apparatus have been illustrated as separate devices, for easy understanding of the invention, the recording and reading apparatus are generally provided as a single apparatus. The laser light sources used in the illustrated embodiments may be used for both recording and reading operations, if the output capacity of these sources may be increased as required. Therefore, the illustrated magneto optical reading system may be used for magneto optical recording operations. As indicated above, the recording apparatus as illustrated include only the elements which are necessary for a magneto optical recording operation, while the reading apparatus as illustrated include only the elements which are necessary for a magneto optical reading operation.
