# Dielectric compositions stabilized against water treeing with organo silane compounds and electric wire or cable insulated with these dielectric compositions.

## Abstract
Dielectric compositions comprising ethylene polymers which are susceptible to electrical breakdown by water treeing are protected against such breakdown by the incorporation therein of organo silanes.
