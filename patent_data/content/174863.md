# Process for producing propylene block copolymer.

## Abstract
A process for producing a propylene block copolymer in the presence of a highly stereospecific olefin polymerization catalyst which comprises comprising producing a crystalline polymer or copolymer of propylene in a first stage and random copolymerizing propylene and another alpha olefin in a mole ratio of from 10 90 to 90 10 in the presence of the propylene polymer or copolymer in a second stage wherein in the random copolymerization, 0.0001 to 0.5 mole, per gram atom of aluminium in the catalyst, of an oxygen containing compound being gaseous in a standard condition or 0.001 to 1 mole, per gram atom of aluminium in the catalyst, of an active hydrogen containing compound being liquid or solid in a standard condition is fed into the random copolymerization reaction system.
