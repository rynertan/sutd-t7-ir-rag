# Device for reversibly occluding a body duct.

## Abstract
A device and method for reversibly occluding a body duct 41 , such as the vas deferens, to prevent fluid flow therethrough. The device comprises two spaced flexible plugs 12, 14 connected to each other by a flexible connecting member 16 , such as a suture or other filament. The plugs are of size so as to be snugly received by the lumen 44 of the body duct at implantation without exerting excessive pressure therein. The device is preferably im planted in the duct by insertion of each plug through a respective puncture hole 46 in the wall 42 of the duct, with a portion of the connecting member being retained external ly of the duct to prevent migration of the plugs.
