# POLYOL ALLYL CARBONATE COMPOSITIONS AND POLYMERIZATES PREPARED THEREFROM

## Abstract
Polyol allyl carbonate , e.g., diethylene glycol bis allyl carbonate , are polymerized in solution, i.e., in an organic solvent, until from 15 to 50 percent of the allylic carbon carbon linkages are consumed. The solvent is then removed yielding a product that is gel free, syrupy viscous liquid of unpolymerized monomer and polymer. This liquid polymer can be polymerized to a hard, transparent material with less shrinkage. Also described is the addition of mono or polyfunctional acrylates to the liquid polymer to produce a polymerizable mixture that can be cured quickly with the addition of a free radical initiator.
