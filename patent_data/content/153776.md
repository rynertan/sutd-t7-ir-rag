# Mains voltage incandescent lamp.

## Abstract
A mains voltage incandescent lamp has inside the lamp vessel 1 a frame 5 8 composed of current supply conduc tors 5,6 and glass beams 7,8 , in which a filament 9 comprising several parallel sections 10 13 is stretched. Two sets of supports 17 and 18 are anchored in the beams 7 and 8, respectively . The supports 17,18 each consist of a wire hook which engages the filament 9 between a respective pair of adjacent sections 11, 12 and 10, 11 . The supports 18 of at least one set each have an end portion 19 extending in a direction which is transverse to the main length of the respective support and is located at a given distance from the bend 20 of the hook. This permits the sections 10 13 to be under the same tension.
