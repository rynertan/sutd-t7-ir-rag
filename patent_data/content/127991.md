# Improvements in and relating to throttled fluid mixing devices.

## Abstract
A throttled fluid mixing device comprises a valve having an axially extending valve casing 2 containing a disc shaped valve member 3 located axially within said casing and arranged for axial movement relatively to a flared inner wall portion 2C of said casing which is arranged to widen con tinuously in a direction away from its upstream end. Axial movement of the valve member 3 serves to throttle the flow of fluid through said casing, and the valve member 3 has, on its downstream side, one or more orifices 3C from which a second fluid can be introduced into the valve casing 2 immediately on the downstream side of the valve member 3 , whereby turbulent flow immediately downstream ofthe valve member 3 is effective to cause mixing of the two fluids. Preferably, the disc shaped valve member has a domed or radiused frontal face, and, on its rear face, an annular recess 3A located adjacent the rim of the disc and coupled to the orifice or orifices 3C .
