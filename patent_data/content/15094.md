# An electrical fuse holder.

## Abstract
A fuse holder for a miniature cartridge fuselink, com prises a hollow body 1 and a fuse carrier 2 , formed as plastic mouldings, and two spring metal contact members 4 engagable with the outside of the body and having central parts 14 which project into the cylindrical chamber 5 of the body through slots 11 in the body wall. The construction is such that the fuse carrier can only be inserted into the body when it is oriented in one predetermined position relative to the body and, in this position, there are barriers 33 of insula tion material between the end caps of a fuselink snapped into the carrier receptacle 19 and the potentially live electrical terminals 4 on the body. When the fuse carrier is fully inserted into the body, it can be rotated through one half turn to engage the end caps of the fuselink with the contacts 4 . The fuse holder prohibits a user from touching any live termi nals and the end caps of the fuselink cannot engage the contacts of the holder whilst the fuselink is being inserted into or removed from the holder.
