# Integrated notch filter.

## Abstract
A notch filter is provided having a low pass section and a summing section which are capable of being integrated on a single semiconductor chip. The summing section provides an output signal which is the sum of a first component signal proportional to an output signal V₂ of the low pass section and a second component signal proportional to current flowing i₁ in a capacitor 12 in the low pass section such that the high frequency response of the low pass section is compensated to provide an output signal V₀ characteristic of a notch filter.
