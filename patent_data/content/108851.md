Disclosed here is an automatic brightness limiter cir cuit in which a separate digital signal display from a per sonal computer is superposed on a television broadcast screen and displayed simultaneously. The beam current of the cathode ray tube is detected and if found to exceed a prescribed value, feedback is applied to the video amplifier circuit only of the television broadcast display. Feedback is not applied to the amplifier circuit of the digital signal dis play. The amplifier of this digital signal display is arranged so that independent limiting action is carried out corre sponding to the amplitude of the digital signal.
