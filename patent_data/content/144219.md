# Process for the production of hydrocarbons from C1 to C4 monohaloalkanes.

## Abstract
A C₁ to C₄ monohaloalkane is converted to hydrocarbons having a greater number of carbon atoms than the monoha loalkane reactant, in particular to aliphatic hydrocarbons in the gasoline boiling range, by contacting the monohaloal kane at elevated temperature with a clay containing either hydrogen ions and or metal cations introduced either by exchange and or by deposition. Preferred as catalysts are the layered clays including stabilised pillared layered clays.
