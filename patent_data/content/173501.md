## Description
SELECTIVE ADSORPTION OF CARBON DIOXIDE ON ZEOLITES The present invention relates to a process for selective adsorption of carbon dioxide from gaseous mixtures. Several methods are known for the removal of carbon dioxide from gaseous mixtures. These include, for instance, absorption in solvents by chemical or physical mechanisms, separation using membranes and adsorption over zeolites. Solvent absorption is most widely used of these processes as it can achieve bulk C02 separations with high recovery. Examples of chemical solvent systems are monoethanolamine and hot potassium carbonate. More recently, physical solvent systems such as Selexol have been used due to their reduced energy costs however, capital costs are still high. Membrane processes are increasingly used in the oil gas field separations of CO2 CH4 where the recovered C02 can be used for enhanced oil recovery. In this case, capital cost and equipment size are both low but C02 recovery and purity are also low. In the zeolite adsorption technique zeolite A is used for removing trace levels of C02 from gas streams. Substantially complete C02 removal is possible due to the high sorption energy between zeolite A and 002. However, regeneration must be carried out by thermal swing, hence this process is not suitable for bulk C02 separations. Accordingly, the present invention is a process for selectively adsorbing carbon dioxide from a mixture thereof with nohacidic gases by passing the mixture over a zeolite and subsequently recovering the adsorbed carbon dioxide during a regeneration cycle of the zeolite characterised in that the zeolite has a faujasite type structure which has been orrexchanged with akali or alkaline earth metal ions and as a silicon to aluminium atomic ratio from 1.2 3. Zeolites of the faujasite type are described in standard texts including Zeolite Molecular Sieves, Structure, Chemistry and Use by Breck, D.W., pp 92 93, published by John Wiley Sons Inc. 1974 and in Molecular Sieve Zeolites l , Advances in Chemistry Series 101, edited by Gould, R.F., pp 171 et seq. and published by theAmerican Chemical Society 1971 . These zeolites are classified as having an FAU type structure as characterised by their X ray diffraction pattern and listed in the book by Meier, W.M. andOlsen, fl.H. entitled, Atlas of Zeolite Structure Types , p 37, published by the Structure Commission of the International ZeoliteAssociation 1978 and distributed by Polycrystal Book Service,Pittsburgh, Pa., USA. Examples of the zeolites of the FAU structure type that may be used include zeolites X a nd Y provided that they have a silicon to aluminium atomic ratio from 1.2 to 3. Zeolites having a silicon to aluminium ratio from 1.5 3, especially those having a ratio from 2 to 3, eg zeolite Y are preferred. The zeolites used may be ion exchanged with alkali or alkaline earth metal ions, such as sodium, by any of the conventional techniques. For instance, sodium ions may be introduced into the zeolite during synthesis by using sodium hydroxide as the alkali.Alternatively, the hydrogen form of the zeolite may be exchanged initially by treatment with sodium hydroxide solution, washed, dried and then granulated with colloidal silica and then dried. The resultant sodium ion exchanged zeolite having a silicon to aluminium atomic ratio from 1.2 to 1.5 hereafter termed NaX or 1.5 to 3 hereafter termed NaY is used for the selective adsorption of carbon dioxide from mixtures thereof with non acidic gases. Examples of the non acidic gases from which carbon dioxide can be separated by the present process include carbon monoxide, nitrogen and methane. Separation of mixtures of C02 and methane isparticularly important in the petroleum industry especially as the C02 recovered can be used in the enhanced oil recovery process. rhe selective adsorption is SULLddiy carried out by passing the gaseous mixture containing carbon dioxide over the alkali alkaline earth metal ion exchanged zeolite at ambient temperature eg 200C and pressure eg 1 bar absolute. The adsorbed carbon dioxide may be recovered and the ion exchanged zeolite regenerated by applying a moderately low vacuum e.g. 10 mbar absolute at ambient temperature or by reducing the C02 partial pressure by use of a gas purge. For instance, using NaY with a silicon to aluminium ratio of 2.4, carbon dioxide was adsorbed from a 50 50 mixture thereof with nitrogen at 200C and 1 bar absolute. The adsorption capacities for carbon dioxide and other non acidic gases are shown in Table 1.The advantage of using a NaY zeolite is that it is highly selective for C02 in the presence of N2, CO and CH4 and it can be regenerated by the application of a vacuum or by a gas purge which enables a bulk C02 separation to be carried out. The adsorption and regeneration cycles can be carried out at pressures from 1 mbar absolute to 40 bar absolute, preferably from 10 mbar absolute to 20 bar absolute. The loading on the zeolite increases with the partial pressure of the adsorbed component.Desorption occurs rapidly as the partial pressure of C02 is reduced. Adsorption can be carried out in the temperature range 800C to 150 C, preferably 500C to 100 C. Loading is increased at lower temperatures whilst rapid adsorption and desorption rates are maintained. It is preferable that the gaseous mixture being treated does not contain moisture as this will reduce the adsorption capacity of the zeolite. The present invention is further illustrated with reference to the following Examples.EXAMPLES A standard NaY zeolite powder obtained from Laporte Industries plc was granulated with oolloid 1silica Ludnx AS 40 Registered Trade Mark obtained from Du Pont to give granules containing 30 silica. Ihe granules were acLivaLeu by heating at 3500C for four hours. The adsoprtion capacity was determined by passing gas at 200C through the granules at atmospheric pressure. The zeolite was regenerated by applying a vacuum of 1 mbar absolute for 10 minutes. Capacities of NaY for C02, N2, CO and CH4 are given in Table 1. Table 2 lists adsorbed gas compositions for variousC02 N2 feed gas mixtures. C02 CH4 and C02 CO separation factors were found to be similar.
