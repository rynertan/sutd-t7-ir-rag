# Thermal coupling.

## Abstract
A thermal coupling which can be interposed between a source of refrigeration and an object to be cooled. The thermal coupling comprises an elongate housing having a first end for receiving said source of refrigeration, a second end for mechanically contacting said object to be cooled and com prises means within said housing defining a flow path whereby when said thermal coupling is positioned with its first end above its second end and is in use, warm fluid rises from said second end toward said first end where it is cooled and returns to said second end along a separate path without contacting warm rising fluid.
