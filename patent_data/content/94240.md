# AUTOMATIC FLOPPY DISC DRIVE LOADER

## Abstract
An automatic floppy disk loader allows a stack of floppy computer disks to be fed into a disk drive, one at a time, and fed out of the drive into selector bins. The loader has an improved, self aligning construction so that the mechanisms used to transport and control the motion of the floppy disk are placed in correct alignment during manufacturing without requiring manual, individualized adjustment. The disk drive is sur rounded by a unitary, partially enclosed frame construction which also serves to support rollers, and disk sensors so that precise alignment is achieved. The alignment improvements also ensure that misalignment does not gradually occur as the loader is used. The loader also includes an improved picker mechanism for feeding floppy disks into a disk drive, where the picker follows a slot in a plate in order to properly align the feeding of the disks and include a hinged, spring loaded feed inhibit bracket which controls the feeding of the disks. The loader includes a pivoting flap which serves to separate the floppy disks which are ejected from the disk drive into one of two vertically separated bins. Improved loader construction allows the automatic feeding of floppy disks while minimizing the chances of jamming or damaging the disks.
