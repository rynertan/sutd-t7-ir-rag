# Ribbon cartridge.

## Abstract
A ribbon cartridge 10 for use in impact printers, typewri ters or the like, in which an inked ribbon is mounted on a sup ply spool 22 and a take up spool 52 enclosed within a hous ing 12, 14 with the center of each spool being supported for rotation and for floating movement along its own guide path. A drive capstan 66 having a fixed center is also located within the housing. The supply spool 22 is mounted upon a torsion arm 26 for movement in an arcuate path and is urged by spring 30 toward and against the take up spool 52 which it self is constrained to move in a straight line along rails 58 be tween the supply spool 22 and the fixed center drive capstan 66 . When the capstan 66 is rotated by an external drive, it rotates the take up spool 52 in order to wind the inked ribbon thereupon while simultaneously unwinding ribbon from the supply spool 22 .
