# Cutting insert and method of making the same.

## Abstract
The wear resistance and toughness of a coated ceramic insert comprising a ceramic substrate and at least one thin surface layer of ceramic oxide is improved by applying at least one thin intermediate layer of hard borides of the subgroups or of the III V groups of the periodic table, or of hard yttrium compounds. The layers are deposited from a gaseous phase.
