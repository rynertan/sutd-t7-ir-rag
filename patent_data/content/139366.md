# Method of manufacturing a soldi state image pickup device.

## Abstract
When a two level solid state image pickup device is manufactured, part of a first metallic electrode 28a electric ally connected to a signal storage region 24b is made to project to the highest position above a substrate on which it is formed. A coating of an organic insulating film 29 is then applied to produce a flat surface. The entire surface of the organic film is then etched to expose the projections A of the first metallic electrode 28a and a second metallic electrode 28b constituting a pixel electrode is connected to the first electrode 28a at the exposed portion thereof.
