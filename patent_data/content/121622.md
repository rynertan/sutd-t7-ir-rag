# Method of and apparatus for continuous casting by the use of mold oscillating system.

## Abstract
A method of continuous casting uses an oscillating system adapted to oscillate a casting mold 4, 104 and involves starting the oscillation of the mold at a preselected frequency higher than the natural frequency of the oscillat ing system and increasing the amplitude of oscillation of the mold to a predetermined value in a range as defined herein. The preselected frequency of oscillation of the mold is preferably approximately 1.5 times higher than the natural frequency of the oscillation system. In an analogous method the rigidity of the frame is preferably such as to provide a natural frequency at least six times higher than the oscillation frequency. Apparatus for performing the methods is also disclosed.
