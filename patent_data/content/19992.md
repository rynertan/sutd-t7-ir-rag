# Thermionic electron emitters and methods of making them.

## Abstract
A thermionic cathode comprises an emitter 3 comprising a matrix 4 of tungsten impregnated with an alkaline earth activator. The matrix is coated with a coating 5 of about 20 30 osmium fully alloyed with tungsten formed by cosputtering osmium and tungsten onto the matrix. A diffusion barrier 6 of osmium may be interposed between the matrix 4 and coating 5 and, optionally, osmium may be diffused into the matrix 4 . Alternatively the whole matrix may comprise a mixture of about 20 30 osmium fully alloyed with tungsten. Alternative to osmium and tungsten may be used, and various modifications may be made, and other methods of making the emitter may be used. In particular the proportion of osmium may be about 40 .
