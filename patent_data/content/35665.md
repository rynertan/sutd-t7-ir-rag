## Abstract
The assembly 10 is provided wherein the support shaft 31 for the retractor spool having a belt S wound thereon is directly mounted on a pair of integral raised flanges 22 on a vehicle structural support member 11 . The ends of the shaft 31 engage the flange by a J shaped anchor 22 and the load caused by the restraining force of the belt S is thus transmit ted directly to the structural support member 11 . In addition, the lock dog 35 is directly supported in a V shaped cutout 24 for direct transmission of the force to the structural sup port. A plastic cover 40 having openings 46 in the sides locate the ends of the shaft 31 and the lock dog 35 during pre assembly. A crosspiece for the pendulum actuator is also pre located in the cover 40 .
