# Gas sensor.

## Abstract
A gas sensor with its photosensitivity allayed which a hydrogen ion sensitive FET transducer having the structure of a gate insulated field effect transistor and an Ag AgCl refer ence electrode 12 are housed inside a flexible tube 11 in such a way that the gate part 2 of said FET transducer 1 and the reference electrode 12 are located at the front end open ing of the tube 11 . Lead wires 13 connected to the FET transducer 11 and the reference electrode 12 extend along the tube 11 which is closed by filling an electrical insulation resin 14 at least in the space of the part inside the tube wall housing the parts connecting the lead wires 13 to the FET transducer 1 and the reference electrode 12 . A hydrophilic polymer 15 containing an electrolyte is put around at least the gate part 2 of said FET 1 and part of the reference electrode 12 , to envelop both of them. All of the surface of the hydro philic polymer 15 and of at least that part of the insulator tube 15 which houses the FET transducer 1 are coated with a gas permeable membrane 16 formed of a colored silicone rubber with a low optical transmittance.
