## Description
Plotters Drawing Aids and like Devices This invention relates to plotters drawing aids and like devices. The invention is particularly, though not exclusively, concerned with chart plotters for maritime navigation. In maritime navigation most chartwork involves the transfer of bearings and courses, usually with reference to a compass rose printed on the chart. Such transfer is commonly carried out using a parallel ruler or parallelogram plotter. Both of these have disadvantages. In particular the ruler requires two handed operation and must be walked painstakingly across the chart it is very difficult to do this in rough weather without slipping and losing accuracy. The disadvantages of the parallel ruler can be readily overcome using a parallelogram plotter instead, but the conventional form of such a plotter requires space extending beyond the draughting or chart area itself this is of especial disadvantage in small boats where the space available is limited and chart space often doubles as a food preparation area or cabin table. British Patent Specification No. 155,153 describes apparatus for facilitating drawing which is intended for application to a drawing board so as to displace a set square in a parallel manner over the board. This apparatus utilises a parallelogram arrangement and comprises a travelling member on which the set square is pivoted to which two flexible tension members are connected at equal distances,one each side of the pivot point for the set square. The tension members lead,via a pair of guides, to a tension equalisation arrangement in the form of a pulley system carried on a fixed element on the apparatus, the guides being so spaced that the two tension members are drawn out and retracted to vary their length together in a parallel manner by manipulation of the travelling member over the board, against the action of the tension equalisation arrangement.Because of the need to provide a pulley system, the fixed element is sufficiently large to require space extending beyond the draughting area of the drawing board as clearly shown in the Figures of the drawings attached to the Patent Specification. Thus, even if the described apparatus was modified for use as a chart plotter, it would be no more suitable for small boats than the conventional parallel plotter referred to above It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved form of plotter drawing aid which is readily applicable where space is at a premium and which is simple and relatively inexpensive to produce. According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a plotter drawing aid of the kind comprising a pair of flexible tension members which are connected at respective common outer ends to a travelling member and which lead back over a pair of guides to a tension equalisation arrangement, the spacing between the tension members where they connect to the travelling member and where they pass over their respective guides being such that the tension members maintain a parallel relationship during movement of the travelling member, this movement causing the tension members to vary their length together, characterised in that the tension equalisation arrangement comprises a single rotatable member to which the inner ends of both tension members are attached at angularly spaced positions, in that said guides are located with respect to the rotatable member such that the tension members approach the rotatable member from opposite directions, and in that said rotatable member is biased in one rotational direction whereby both the tension members are wound onto said rotatable member. Preferably, the tension members are in the form of tapes, the inner ends of which are so connected to the rotatable member that they wind upon one another in bifilar fashion. This and other aspects and features of the present invention will be apparent from the following description with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 illustrates the principle of a conventional parallelogram plotter Figure 2 illustrates the principle of a parallelogram plotter in accordance with the present invention Figure 3 is a plan view, with cover plate removed, of an example of parallelogram plotter in accordance with the present invention Figure 4 is an end elevation of the parallelogram plotter of Figure 3 Figure 5 is a perspective view of the parallelogram plotter of Figure 3 and Figures illustrate details of construction of 6 and 7 the parallelogram plotter of Figure 3. Referring to Figure 1, the conventional form of parallelogram plotting or draughting device utilizes two intercoupled parallelograms with fixed length sides one of which, side AA , is normally fixed to the chart or draughting table T. The sides are pivoted to one another, but wherever side BB is placed within the limits of extension of the intercoupled parallelograms, the angle of the side BB with respect to the side AA remains constant.A straightedge SE is pivoted to side BB and may be locked to it so that once the straightedge SE has been aligned with a vector or otherwise set to a desired angle and then locked to the side BB , it may be transferred from one place to any other of the table T to lay on a parallel vector or line accurately, without difficulty. However there is the disadvantage with this form of plotter that for some positions of the straightedge SE the arms extend well beyond the boundaries of the table T. Furthermore parts of the table area are obscured from view by the arms, and the general construction of the device is bulky and cumbersome. The parallelogram plotter of the present invention as illustrated in Figure 2, seeks to overcome the above disadvantages of the conventional parallelogram plotter by applying the parallelogram principle in a different way.Instead of two coupled parallelograms, only one having a pair of opposite sides CD and C D of variable length, is used. In this way a straightedge S E pivoted on the side DD opposite the fixed side CC , may be positioned anywhere on the table T to preset a vector or angle. When the straightedge S E is locked to side DD , it may be moved to any other positionwon the table T and will maintain the same vector angle provided that the lengths of the adjustable sides CD and C D remain equal to one another. A plotter incorporating the above described principle of the present invention is illustrated in Figures 3 to 7 and will now be described. Preferring to Figures 3 to 5, a straightedge 1 is pivoted on a travelling nebber in the form of an arm 2 to which are attached flexible tension members in the form of tapes 3 and 4. The tapes 3 and 4 feed round a pair of guides in the form of posts 5 and 6 and thence to wind upon one another in bifilar fashion round a rotatable iriter in the form of a drum 7. The drum 7 is rotated to tension the tapes 3 and 4 under the action of a helical torsion spring 8 inside the drum, so as to draw the arm 2 in, up towards the posts 5 and 6. Post 5 and 6 are moulded integrally with a base 9 for example of glass filled polypropylene which may be fixed to any convenient point around the plotting table or draughting surface.The drum 7 Cfor example of nylon is rotatably mounted plain bearing on a stud 10 that projects upwardly from the base 9, between the base 9 and a coverplate 11 omitted from Figure 3,and for example of glass filled polypropylene that is clamped onto the two posts 5 and 6 anc a third post 12 of the base 9. The posts 5 and 6 are provided with respective outer sleeves 13 and 14 for example of polytetrafluorethylene on which the tapes 3 and 4 run this eases passage of the tapes 3 and 4 round the posts 5 and 6 as the arm 2 is moved in and out, and avoid any need for use of special pulleys. The outer diameters of the sleeves 13 and 14 are the same as those of posts 15 and 16 to which the outer ends of the tapes 3 and 4 are respectively anchored on the arm 2. This ensures that an accurate parallelogram is maintained irrespective of the position of the arm 2 relative to the base 9. The tapes 3 and 4 are anchored at their inner ends to the periphery of the drum 7 and their lengths set so that the arm 2 is parallel to a line joining the centres of the two posts 5 and 6. More particularly, the tapes 3 and 4 are anchored to the drum 7 at diametrically opposite points so that equal tape lengths to the arm 2 are accurately maintained due to the positioning of the posts 5 and 6 there is an Ir rement of half a revolution in the winding diameter i.e. draw off positions of the tapes 3 and 4, but since the tape anchorage points on the drum are diametrically opposite one another, the same increment is experienced simultaneously by both tapes.Because the tapes 3 and 4 are wound on the same drum and are interleaved helically, they always wind and unwind in unison and by equal amounts, so maintaining the parallelogram. The tapes 3 and 4.must be very flexible, but at the same time must exhibit minimal stretch they may advantageously in this respect be of thin e.g. 0.19 mm thickness polyester material such as sold as Melinex 226 Melinex being a trade mark . Furthermore, the tapes 3 and 4 may be formed by opposite end lengths of a single tape that extends across the inside of the drum 7 to emerge through diametricallyopposed anchorage slots in the drum periphery. On the other hand, and as provided in the specific plotter illustrated, separate lengths may be used with their inner ends anchored to the drum periphery this enables a more compact drum 7 to be utilized. The separate length tapes 3 and 4 may be enlarged at both ends formed by subjecting the ends to heat to facilitate their anchorage both to the drum 7 and the posts 15 and 16.In the latter respect, the outer enlarged ends of the tapes 3 and 4 engage to be retained respectively in parallel slots 17 and .18 of the posts 15 and 16, whereas, as illustrated in detail in Figures 6 and 7, their inner enlarged ends engage in respective diammetrically opposed slots 19 and 20 in the drum periphery.to effect their firm retention to the drum 7. The slot 19 also provides a convenient outer anchorage for the spring 8 within the drum 7, as illustrated in Figure 6. The spring 8, which is preferably a constant tension stainless steel spring with a torque selected in the range of 750 to 1200 gm cm such as sold under the trade mark Tensator ,is anchored at its inner end in a slot 21 of a downwardly projecting hollow arbor 22 that is formed integrally with the cover plate 11 and engages upon the stud 10. Clamping pressure between the straightedge 1 and the arm 2 can be slackened off to enable the straightedge 1 to be angularly oriented as desired with respect to the arm 2 by rotating a knob 23 atop the arm 2. Once the desired orientation of the straightedge 1 which may be pivoted centrally of its length, or otherwise, to the arm 2 has been achieved,it may again be clamped tightly to the arm 2 to retain that relative orientation, simply by tightening up the knob 23 . Thus in order to transfer a vector using the plotter of Figures 3 to 7 it is simply necessary first to loosen the knob 23 and orientate the straightedge 1 into alignment with, or to be otherwise parallel to, the required vector. The straightedge 1 is then locked by tightening of the knob 23, and may then be moved to a new position to transfer that vector.The tapes 3 and 4 automatically retract onto the drum 7 to take up any slack under the tension of the spring 8 as the straightedge is moved, and can be readily extended against the action of the spring 8 as desired to enable unrestricted movement of the straightedge 1 anywhere over the chart. Because of its compactness and portability, the extending parallelogram plotter of Figures 3 to 7 offers advantage over the conventional fixed parallelogram plotter. Furthermore it provides minimal obscuration within the chart area, and does not need to extend outside the boundaries of that area in use. The base 9 is preferably mounted in one corner of the chart table so as to avoid inaccuracies that can arise where an overflattened configuration of parallelogram is utilized. Mounting by means of two screws may be facilitated by provision of a slot 24 opening from the base periphery, and an aperture 25 of key hole shape in the base 9, as illustrated in Figure 3. Although the principle of the extending parallelogram device of the present invention has been described above more especially in regard to maritime plotting, it is readily applicable also to aviation and other navigation. Moreover it is applicable beyond the field of navigation to draughting aids where transfers of parallel lines and vectors are to be achieved.
