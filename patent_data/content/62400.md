# Forming high density carbon material by hot pressing.

## Abstract
A high hardness and strength carbon material is produced by depositing a body of graphite carbon, e.g. precompacted graphite or a mass of powdery graphite carbon, of a predetermined shape and dimension in a collapsible receptacle shaped and dimensioned to tightly retain the body therein, the receptacle being collapsible in at least one dimension under external pressure while holding the body against expansion. High pressure is applied to the body while the body is heated to an elevated temperature and for a sufficient period to cause a central region of the body to be liquefied and the remainder thereof to be sintered. While under con tinuous pressure, the body is cooled to give the carbon material.
