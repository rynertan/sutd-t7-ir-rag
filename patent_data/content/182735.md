# Fluid control device particularly useful in liquid transfusion apparatus.

## Abstract
A fluid control device for a liquid transfusion line com prises an inlet connector 4 and an outlet connector 8 , and a flexible conduit 10 defining two, three or more passage ways 11, 12, 13 extending in parallel between them to provide a plurality of parallel paths for the flow of the fluid. The device further includes a restrictor 16, 18 in one or more of the passageways 11, 12, 13 restricting the flow ac cording to a fixed predetermined rate lower than that of unre stricted passageway 12 , and a manual control member 14 for selectively closing the passageways 11, 12, 13 to produce a flow of the fluid from the inlet connector 4 to the outlet connector 8 according to a preselected fixed rate.
