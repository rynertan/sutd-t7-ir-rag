# Brake control mechanisms for use with trailers.

## Abstract
A brake control mechanism is adapted to operate trailer brakes in an overrun manner, and to incorporate a handbrake mechanism. A draw shaft 2 of a towing cou pling acts on a first arm 21 of an overrun brake link 4 , which has a second arm 22 on which there is provided a connection point 6 for a brake rod 23 . When the brakes are actuated in an overrun manner, the brake link 4 is activated by the draw shaft 2 and pivots about a first pivot point 5 . When the handbrake mechanism is activated, the overrun brake link 4 is caused to pivot about a second pivot point 10 , such that the maximum travel of the aforementioned connection point 6 for the brake rod 23 is greater than in an overrun braking action. Means 25 is provided for resiliently basing the overrun brake link 4 into a brake actuating position.
