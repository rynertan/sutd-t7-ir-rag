## Description
CHROMIUM CCIEOUNDS, CATALYSTS AND EnEM iENE POLYMERS This invention relates to polymers made from ethylene. In another aspect, this invention relates to chromium catalysts and in particular to dual valence chromium catalysts. In yet another aspect this invention relates to processes to polymerize olefins using such chromium catalysts as well as to processes to make the catalysts. The present invention relates also to novel chromium compounds. In yet another aspect this invention relates to a process to produce polychromium compounds. Background of the invitirn Ethylene polymerization and copolymerization Low pressure ethylene polymerization and copolymerization is widely practiced commercially. One successful catalyst system for such a polymerization is based on chromium. The basic process is described inU.S. Patent 2,825,721. High density ethylene homopolymers as well as ethylene l olefin copolymers of lower density have been commercially produced using chromium catalysts for many years. The copolymerization of ethylene and other olefins results in the generation of side chains or side groups along the main carbon chain of the polymer. Thus, copolymerization of ethylene and propylene results in methyl side groups while butene l or respectively hexene l, when copolymerized with ethylene over chromium catalysts, results in polymers having ethyl or respectively n butyl side chains. The number of side chains, their lengths and their distribution in the polymer molecule influence the properties of the polymer. Generally speaking side chains in the polymer tend to disrupt the crystallinity of the polymer and thereby reduce the density. The price of sufficiently pure 1 olefins has originally caused the use of butene l as the major 1 olef in used in the production of modified ethylene polymer resins. Later, when hexene l became available at reasonable prices and purities, this olefin was used extensively in the production of such modified ethylene polymers. However, l olefins, such as butene and hexene, still are significantly more expensive than ethylene and thereby increase the price of ethylene l olefin copolymers produced. Horse recently a low pressure polymerization process has been discovered by which a polymer is produced using only ethylene as the monomer and yet resulting in a linear polymer having short side chains.Unlike high pressure free radical ethylene polymerization, this process does not cause any significant long chain branching. Such a process for producing lineat low density polyethylene using only ethylene as a feedstock is described in U.S. Patent 4,325,839 which issued toMax P. McDaniel. One of the advantages of this new process is that only ethylene and no other olefins are necessary to produce a copolymer with the modifying short side chains. Although the possibility of making short chain branched, linear ethylene homopolymers using mixed chromium catalysts is an exciting new technology, further development is desirable. anium Ccmpcxards Mono and binuclear chromium complexes are known in the art.E.g., tetrakis trimethylsilylmethyl chromium IV , Cr TMS 4 bis p trimethylsilylmethyl bis trimethylphosphine trimethylsilylmethyl dichromium II , Cr2 CH2SiMe3 4 PMe3 2 bis p allyl bis allyl di chromium II , Cr2 C3H5 4 having been disclosed by their chemical name.The term TMS refers to the trimethylsilylmethyl ligand. Chromium compounds have a wide variety of utilities depending upon their structure and their specific activities. Certain inorganic hexavalent chromium compounds, in particular, CrO3, have been found to be highly active catalyst components in the catalytic polymerization of ethylene and other olefins. This fundamental discovery has led to significant research and further chromium compounds have been discovered which are useful in the general area of olefin polymerization. It is a continued goal to find new chromium compounds having specific properties rendering them useful for particular applications. The Invention It is one object of this invention to provide novel ethylene polymers. In particular, it is an object of this invention to provide such polymers which allow industrial application in areas such as blow molding. Another object of this invention is to provide a process for polymerizing ethylene into low density linear polymers. A particular object of this invention is to provide such a process in which no olefins of very low molecular weight or only a relatively small amount of such olefins are produced, e.g. oligomers of ethylene. Another object of this invention is to provide a new olefin polymerization catalyst. A more specific object is to provide such a catalyst which, when employed in ethylene polymerization, produces a polymer which after removal of any solvent or diluent is substantially dry and non sticky. Yet a further object of this invention is to provide a process to produce such polymerization catalysts.It is a still further object of this invention to provide novel chromium cxxtnds. Another object of this invention is to provide novel chromium compounds having more than 2 chromium atoms per molecule. A yet further object of this invention is to provide a process to produce polychromium compounds. Brief Description of the Drawing FIGURE 1 is a computer generated, simplified structural formula of a molecule of this invention as determined by single crystal x ray crystallography, and FIGURE 2 is a further simplified structural representation of the same molecule shown in FIGURE 1. In accordance with this invention it has been found that certain novel chromium compounds as defined in the following exhibit unusual and advantageous properties they are particularly useful as catalyst components or catalyst precursors in catalytic ethylene polymerization. In accordance with this invention it now has been found that a novel chromium based catalyst allows the production of various olefin polymers and particularly linear low density polymers from ethylene alone with desirable properties of the polymer produced and with desirable features for the polymerization process. This new polymerization catalyst is characterized by the incorporation of a specific novel chromium compound to be defined in the following disclosure. The Chromium Compounds In accordance with a first embodiment of this invention a group of novel chromium compounds is provided.

The n chromium atoms of the novel compounds of this invention are connected to each other in a single or double ring structure, preferably as one ring of 4 chromium atoms. The ring structure and the above formula are believed to accurately describe the novel compoundsIt should be emphasized, however, that complex chemical bonds are involved in the novel molecules of this invention and the details, scientific analysis and description of these compounds are given vith the understanding that the invention here involved should not be limited thereby. The presently preferred chromium compound is octakis p trimethylsilylmethyl tetrachromium II . This compound is schematically shown in FIGURES 1 and 2. In FIGURE 1 the hydrogens of the outside methyl groups have been left off for clarity. In FIGURE 2 the molecule is shown yet further simplified with all methyl groups left off.Each of the silicon atoms Sil to Si8 has 3 methyl groups attached to it. Process to Produce Polychromium Compounds In accordance with a second embodiment of this invention a process to produce polychromium compounds is provided. This process comprises adding a substituting alkylating agent, selected from the group consisting of aluminum, sodium, lithium and magnesium agents having the formula Me R Y xyz wherein Me is Al, Na, Li, Mg, or Zn. Y is halogen, preferably chlorine R is CH2 M R1R2R3 as defined above x is 1 or in the case where Me is Al x is 1 or 2 z is 0 or more y z is the valence or remaining valence of Mex preferably a magnesium compound having the formula Y Mg R, wherein Y is halogen preferably C1 or R to a Cr compound CrX2. The preferred process comprises adding a Grignard reagent Y halogen wherein, the substituent R is as defined above to a solution of CrX2 in a solvent and recovering the chromium compound produced thereby from said solvent. X is chlorine, bromine or iodine. The preferred Grignard reagent used has the general formulaXMgR, wherein R and X are as defined above. The preferred chromium compound used in the process of this invention is CrCl2. Various liquids for suspending the chromium dihalide can be used. It is particularly preferred to use a liquid which increases the solubility of the chromium dihalide in the reaction fluid medium. Thus, a liquid which is a Lewis base is preferred. Ethers can be used. Cyclic ethers such as tetrahydrofuran THF are particularly preferred. The substituting agent, particularly the Grignard reagent or respectively MgR2 , in accordance with this invention is added to the suspension of the chromium halide. It is preferred that the magnesium compound is added in the form of a solution. Ethers are particularly preferred solvents for the magnesium compounds, e.g. the Grignard reagents, here involved. Diethyl ether is the presently preferred solvent for these compounds. Some of the Grignard reagents here involved are commercially available materials. These products can be conveniently produced by adding a compound having the formula X R, wherein X is a halide atom andR has the above defined meaning, chlorine being preferred for X, to finely divided elemental magnesium, such as magnesium turnings, suspended in a dry diluent such as diethyl ether or THE. In accordance with this invention, it has been found that the order of addition of the reactants is important. It has been found that the Grignard reagent should be added dropwise to a suspension of CrCl2 in the reaction fluid e.g. THF to prepare the desired polynuclear chromium complexes. When CrCl2 is added to the Grignard reagent, the prior art Cr complexes are formed. It is presently believed that the same order of addition is to be employed in the case of the other substituting agents as well. The diluents, solvents and reactants used in the process of this invention are preferably employed in ranges as shown the following table. Table Broad Specific Substituting agent, preferably YngR mole 1.8 to 3 1.9 to 2.2 Solvent, mL per g agent 2 to 10 3 to 6 CrX2 mole 1 1 Diluent, mL per g CrX2 50 to 500 75 to 150The above tabulation is based on 1 mole of CrX2 fractions or multiples thereof are of course contemplated, as will be apparent to a person skilled in the art. The compounds of this invention are preferably prepared in a dry, oxygen free ambient, e.g. under argon, nitrogen or helium at temperatures generally below OOC, preferably in a temperature range and sufficient pressure to maintain liquid phase conditions, generally at about atmospheric pressure at about 200C to about 1000C. The reaction is carried out generally under a pressure maintaining liquid phase, generally at about atmospheric pressure. The compounds prepared by the reaction step of the process of this invention are recovered by separation techniques including decanting, filtering, washing, drying, particularly vacuum drying. It is presently preferred to extract the product of the reaction step of the inventive process following the solvent removal with hydrocarbon fluids such as alkanes, particularly preferred is n pentane. The CatalystIn accordance with a further esixxlunent of this invention a novel catalyst is provided. This catalyst is characterized by a solid support and the novel chromium compound as defined above. Supports The supports on which the new compounds exhibit their catalytic activity are preferably inorganic oxide containing supports.Particularly preferred are supports selected from the group consisting of silica, silica alumina, alumina, fluorided alumina, silated alumina, thoria, aluminum phosphate, phosphated silica, phosphated alumina, silica titania, coprecipitated silica titania, fluorided silated alumina being presently preferred, and mixtures thereof as well as any one or sore of these supports containing chromium, preferably chromium in an activated stage such as hexavalent chromium. One particular application of the new compounds and a first variation of this embodiment of this invention is an olefin polymerization catalyst containing two or more different catalytic sites.Particularly the new compounds can be employed in dual valence chromium catalysts. In these applications, the new chromium compounds are contacted with an already active olefin polymerization catalyst. A preferred dual site catalyst is obtained by contacting one or more of the new chromium compounds with an olefin polymerization catalyst comprising catalytically active chromium sites. An example of such application would be to contact the new chromium compounds with an olefin polymerization catalyst containing hexavalent chromium. In accordance with a preferred catalyst of this invention these new chromium compounds are contacted with an activated chromium catalyst, the latter often being referred to as a Phillips catalyst. Such Phillips catalysts are described in, e.g., U.S. Patent 2,825,721, U.S. Patent 3,887,494, U.S. Patent 4,081,407 and U.S. Patent 4,312,967 The preferred supports used for the production of the catalyst of this invention are characterized by the following physical properties Physical Characteristics of the Preferred Supports Physical Properties Broad Specific Pore VolumeÚ, cc g 0.4 to 3.5 0.8 to 2.5 Surface Areaê, mê g 200 to 800 250 to 600 1As determined by mercury intrusion. 2As determined by BET nitrogen sorption The catalysts of this invention are made from the support and the chromium compound as defined. Generally speaking about 0.01 to 2 parts by weight of chromium per 100 parts by weight of support are utilized on the catalyst. Preferably the range for the chromium compound is 0.1 to 1.5 parts by weight of chromium per 100 parts by weight cif solid support. As pointed out, the solid support is either an inorganic oxidic support as such or is such a support having additionally incorporated therein chromium catalytic sites, preferably hexavalent activated chromium catalytic sites. Process to Produce the Catalyst In accordance with a second embodiment of this invention a process to produce the novel catalyst defined above is provided. This process includes contacting the solid support with the chromium compound defined under the usual dry, oxygen free conditions. This contacting is preferably done by impregnating the support with the compound using a solution of the new compound. Following such an impregnation step, the solvent is removed by such techniques as decanting and vacuum drying. It is not inconceivable that in this process the chromium compound defined above undergoes complexing and pr chemical reactions with the support.Applicants do not wish to be bound by any theory in this area, however. When a solution of the novel chromium compounds is used to impregnate the support, the chromium compound is utilized in a quantity of 0.05 to 5 parts by weight of Cr per 100 parts by weight of solvent.Suitable solvents for this purpose are n pentane, n hexane, cyclohexane,THE and ethanol anhydrous . Alternatively, the support and the chromium compound can be separately charged to a polymerization reactor where they react prior to or during admitting of the monomer s . The Polymerization Process The catalyst described above can be used for the polymerization of ethylene and other olefins. The catalysts are particularly useful for the polymerization of olefins having 2 to 12, preferably 2 to 8 carbon atoms. A further embodiment of this invention resides in a process to polymerize or copolymerize ethylene using the catalyst defined above.The preferred process uses ethylene as the sole olefinic feedstock. The polymerization process of this invention can be carried out in gas phase, solution or particle slurry form. The presently preferred process is one in which a liquid diluent together with the ethylene and optionally further olefin, particularly up to 10 mole Z of l olefins having 3 to 12, preferably 4 8, carbon atoms is employed.Examples for such diluents or solvents are paraffins, cycloparaffins or aromatic hydrocarbons, with about 3 to 12 carbon atoms, particularly isobutane, isopentane, cyclohexane and benzene. The preferred diluent or solvent is isobutane. The polymerization conditions employed are those well known to persons skilled in the art in this area. The conditions are not particularly critical and the specific condition utilized depends largely upon the desired results. Typical ranges for such polymerization conditions are given in the following Temperature O to 4500F Pressure 100 to 700 psia pressure is high enough to maintain the liquid phase under the polymerization temperature conditions Polymerization Time 15 to 180 min. Catalyst Concentration 0.005 to 0.200 g l of reactor contents The polymer produced by the process of this invention is recovered utilizing also standard techniques. These techniques involve settling, flashing, vacuum drying. The polymer particles produced can then be converted into pellet form utilizing commercially available equipment. The Polymer In accordance with another embodiment of this invention a polymer produced by a specific polymerization process is provided. The polymer is characterized by having substantially only short chain branches, particularly having little or no branches containing 8 or more carbon atoms. The polymer involved has at least 0.4 mole branchingOf all the branches present in the polymer less than 0 are methyl branches and over 90 are even numbered alkyl branches, specifically ethyl and butyl branches. The number average molecular weight as determined by NMR techniques of this polymer is in the range of 11,000 to 30,000, preferably 15,000 to 28,000. The density of the polymer is generally in the range of about 0.920 to 0.960. One particularly advantageous feature of the polymer made by the process described above is the substantial absence of telomers and of waxy low molecular weight components. The product made by the process contains little or no octenes, decenes or other low molecular weight olefins. The preferred polymers of this invention are those linear polymers from ethylene as the sole olefinic polymerization feedstock which have properties within one or more of the following ranges Weight Average Molecular Weight 20,000 to 1,000,000 or more Crystalline Melting Point 240 to 2650F to 1300C The absence of long chain branching, i.e. the presence of only short chain branching in the polymer, is characterized by a g value in the range of 0.9 to 1. This g value is determined in accordance with known methods as described for instance in J. Appl. Sci. 21, 3331 3343 1977 .Attention is drawn to the fact that in the case of a polymer with broad molecular weight distribution the g value has to be determined by fractionating the polymer, measuring the viscosities for the individual fractions, determining the g value for the individual fractions and weight averaging the g values found to obtain a total g value. The concentration of methyl branches, ethyl branches etc. is determined by standard NMR techniques as described for instance in Carbon 13 NMR In Polymer Quantitative Analyses, by J. C. Randall andE. T. Hsieh, Chapter 9, ACS Monograph No. 247, 1983. The specific value for the mole concentration of the short chain branching is defined as the number of branch points along the polymer CH groups per 200 polymer backbone carbon atoms. The molecular weights of the polymer, e.g. weight average and number average molecular weights , are generally determined by size exclusion chromatography using commercially available equipment. The molecular weight distribution is characterized by the heterogeneity index. This heterogeneity index HI is the ratio of weight average to number average molecular weight. The density of the polymer is measured in accordance with ASTMD1505. The crystalline melting point is measured by differential thermal analysis methods using commercially available equipment. One method for measuring the polymer melting point is described in ASTn D1693, condition A. Another embodiment of this invention resides in a narrowly defined class of linear, low density ethylene polymers. These polymers have ethyl and butyl branches as the predominant branching structure.The polymers are further characterized within the above given polymer parameters by those shown in the following table Broadly SpecificallyDensity g cc 0.930 0.9l5 0.930 Molecular weight 10,000 15,000 28,000 Number average HI 10 15 30Long Chain Substantially Not more than 1 longBranching None chain branch per 10,000 backbone carbons Long chain branching determined preferably by melt flow activation energy. The new polymers of this invention can be used in applications where other linear low density polyethylenes are used. In particular the polymers can be extruded and blown into film. The polymers can also be extruded into pipes and they can be used for injection molding, blow molding, rotational molding, wire and cable coating. The following examples are provided to further illustrate preferred features of this invention without undue limitation of its scope. Example IA Comparison, Prior Art Mononuclear Cr Complex The reactants, CrCl2, Mg and trimethylsilylmethyl chloride chloromethyltrimethylsilane TMSC were obtained commerciallyReaction solvents were reagent grade, dried over an appropriate drying agent usually calcium hydride , distilled and stored under argon prior to use. Unless indicated otherwise, all manipulations were carried out in an inert atmosphere of either argon or nitrogen. 2.0 g 80 mmole of Mg turnings were suspended in 100 mL of Tiff and brought to reflux. 11 mL 80 mmoles of TnSC neat was added dropwise resulting in a vigorous reaction. After completing the addition the clear solution was stirred one hour and cooled to 300C. Then 5.0 g 40 rmole of CrCl2 were slowly added while maintaining a temperature of about 300C. The reaction solution was then allowed to slowly warm to room temperature 230 C resulting in a darkening in color which after about one hour turned blackish blue. After stirring at room temperature for about 24 hours the solution became royal purple in color. The solvent was removed under vacuum and the residue was extracted with portions of n pentane until the pentane phase was nearly colorless.The combined extracts were filtered over two grams of activated silica The filtrate was evaporated to dryness at 780C the product is very soluble in n pentane and hard to crystallize resulting in 4.6 g 29 of theoretical of purple crystals, Cr TMS 4.

Example B Invention, Cr4 TMS 8 The reactants, CrCl2 and Grignard reagent trimethylsilylmethylmagnesium chloride, were obtained commercially. Reaction solvents were reagent grade, dried and distilled as before. Manipulations were carried out as before. 25 g 203 mmole of CrC12 were suspended in 500 ml of THE at 300C. Then 250 mL of trimethylsilylmethylmagnesium chloride solution 1.6 H in diethylether, 400 mmole were added dropwise over a two hour period while maintaining a reaction temperature of 300C. The reaction solution was then allowed to slowly warm to room temperature 230C . The solvent was removed under vacuum and the remaining residue was extracted with five 300 mL portions of n pentane. The combined extracts were filtered over 5 g of activated silica. The filtrate was reduced to about 300 mL by vacuum distillation and stored at 780C overnight.The resulting brownish black crystalline mass was recovered by decanting the mother liquor, washing the mass with 500 mL of cold 780C n pentane and drying it under vacuum, first at 780C, then gradually warming to room temperature.

A total of 10,057 total reflections were measured of which 9,122 were unique and which 5,635 were used in the final refinement. Corrections were Lorentz polarization, linear decay from 1.00 to 1.10 on I . C. Structure solution and refinement The computer hardware software employed was a PDP 11 60 based Texray system utilized by Molecular Structures Corporation. The positions of the Cr and Si atoms were obtained from the best E map computed with the automatic direct methods routine in the refinement program. Refinement was determined by means of the full matrix least squares method. The hydrogen atoms were located from a difference map and included in the refinement with anisotropic temperature factors. The position of 16 hydrogen atoms in the structure were obtained from isotropically refined data. The remaining 72 methyl group hydrogens were included in calculated positions assuming idealized geometries with C H 0.95 and were not refined. The molecular structure of Cr4 TMS 8 as drawn by the computer is shown in Figure 1 with the atom numbering scheme used and the methyl hydrogen atoms omitted for clarity. The main features are the four chromium atoms in an almost square planar configuration linked together by Cr Cr multiple bonds and through carbon atoms to eight bridging TMS ligands. Each metal metal bond is bridged by two TMS ligands, one below and one above the plane of the Cr atoms as is perhaps more clearly seen in Figure 2. Another feature of the novel compound is the bonding interactions between hydrogen atoms in the bridging positions and the chromium atoms. Each chromium atom has two such bonding interactions represented in Figure 2, for example, by the units H4 Crl H15, H2 Cr2 H6,H7 Cr3 Hll and H9 Cr4 H13. Analytical results thus confirm the novel compound to be Cr4 TMS 8. Example II Catalyst Preparation Catalysts produced with Cr4 TMS 8 can be formed in situ in the reactor by injection of separately charged portions of a solution of an organochromium compound and a particulste support or by precontact of the two components before charging the resulting catalyst to the reactor. In the first method Method A l , the desired quantity of Cr4tTMS 8 solution as, for example, a 0.1 molar solution in n pentane, is flushed with a portion of the diluent, e.g. isobutane, into the reactor already containing the previously charged support and remaining diluent.Ethylene is then immediately admitted and polymerization commences. No delay for catalyst reaction time is necessary. This method is also applicable to the formation of multivalent chromium catalysts MethodA 2 . In Method A 2, an activated, supported hexavalent chromium containing catalyst is separately charged to the reactor where it reacts with the separately injected organochromium compound to produce the novel catalyst composition.

Grade 969 MSB containing about 1 weight percent chromium, the catalyst activated as above at 8000C. The silica titania supported hexavalent chromium catalyst used was Davison Chemical Co. Grade 963 cogel comprising about 1 weight percent chromium on a coprecipitated silica titania cogel about 2.5 weight percent titanium as TiO2 , the composite activated as above at 7000C. The preceding 963 cogel catalyst was also activated in a modified procedure wherein it was first heated for 3 hours at 8000C in a CO atmosphere while being fluidized and then for 3 hours at 7000C in dry air while being fluidized. This procedure is described in U.S. Patent 4,151,122 and for convenience is described asR cogel in this invention. A more efficient use of Cr4 TMS 8 with the support Method B l or with the hexavalent chromium containing supported catalyst MethodB 2 is accomplished by precontacting the organochromium compound with the second component in the absence of moisture and oxygen. In this method, for example, a 0.1 molar solution of Cr4 TMS 8 in n heptane is contacted with about 1 g of second component suspended in about 20 to 30 mL of n heptane. After several minutes of stirring, all of the organochromium compound reacts with the second component yielding a light to dark brown colored catalyst and a clear supernatant. The supernatant can be decanted and the catalyst slurry can be used as is or further washed with dry hydrocarbon and then charged to the reactor in slurry form.Alternately, the solvent can be evaporated from the catalyst slurry by gentle heating in a nitrogen or argon atmosphere. The resulting free flowing powder can be charged in that form to the reactor. In Method B l, a fluorided silated alumina described inMethod A l , number 4 was employed as the support. In Method B 2, the supports described in Method A 2 were employed. Example III Ethylene Polymerization All polymerization runs were conducted in a 2 liter autoclave reactor under particle form slurry conditions containing about 600 g isobutane as diluent and a weighed amount of support or catalyst as indicated. Generally, the amount of catalyst and support employed ranged from about 0.02 to about 0.1 g. The temperature employed ranged fre 85 to 1050C 185 2210F . The total reactor pressure was held constant in each run at about 565 psia 3.89 Hpa with ethylene or a combination of ethylene plus hydrogen, when used. The ethylene was supplied on demand from a pressurized reservoir as needed. A run time of 1 hour was normally employed. Recovered polymers were stabilized with a conventional antioxidant system before physical properties were determined. The results are given in Table I.

The results in Table I demonstrate that active ethylene polymerization catalyst systems result from the interaction in the reactor of the separately added Cr4 TMS 8 and support. The organochromium compound is most active in the presence of fluorided alumina Runs 10 12 and fluorided silated alumina Runs 13,14 with calculated productivities ranging from about 3800 to 9000 g g catalyst hr. The results indicate a significant improvement over pure alumina Runs 6,7 , aluminum phosphate runs 3 5 and pure silica Runs 1,2 in terms of productivity. The activation temperature of the support can have a marked effect on the activity of the catalyst system. For the active fluorided alumina support, for example, an activation temperature of about 6000C appears to be about optimum.Activities drop off shar JIS when activation temperatures of 400 or 5000C are used Runs 8,9 .Increasing the reactor temperature at which the polymerization is rui with a given catalyst system tends to increase catalyst activity. Runs 10, 11 and 12 indicate that raising the reactor temperature from 850 Lo 960C to 1030C increases productivity from 3800 to 4300 to 5600 g g catalyst hr. These runs 10 12 also indicate that melt index or high load melt index does not change appreciably with reactor temperature suggesting that temperature alone is not effective in controlling polymer molecular weight with these catalyst systems. In the presence of hydrogen, each catalyst system excluding silica, not tested , as expected, produced lower molecular weight polymer relative to that made in the absence of hydrogen. The alumina based systems were much less responsive to the effects of hydrogen based on tbe MI and or HLMI results MI increased from 0 to 1.4, HLMI increased from 0 to 88, Runs 6 14 than the AlPO4 based system, Runs 3 5 wherein MI increased from 0 to 39, HLMI increased from 7.3 to a large undetermined value. The polymer densities of about 0.950 g cc obtained in the absence of hydrogen for the alumina based systems taken in conjunction with the relatively high molecular weight polymers made as evidenced by the fractional HIMI values suggest that ethylene homopolymers were primarily made. With the silica based system, however, the polymer density of about 0.944 g cc obtained in Run 2 at a MI of about 0.2 are indicative of possible branching in the polymer structure. This catalyst system is not sufficiently active to be commercially attractive. Example IV Ethylene was polymerized with catalysts formed by contacting the F Si A1203 support with the specified organochromium compounds, isolating the solid compositions and using portions of each as before.The results are given in Table II.

In the absence of hydrogen, the comparison catalyst Run 10 appears to be substantially more active than the inventive catalyst based on the calculated productivity values of 14,600 vs 6200, respectively. Both catalysts produced polymers of about the same molecular weight, RIMI of about 0.36 to 0.39.The significantly lower polymer densities and flexural moduli of the polymers produced with the inventive catalyst suggest that they contain greater amounts of short chain branching, however. Example V Selected polymers produced with the preceding catalysts were further evaluated with respect to molecular weight and short chain branching. The results obtained are set forth in Table III.

The results given in Table III demonstrate that the catalysts employed in ethylene polymerization produced polyethylenes of varying molecular weights and molecular weight distributions which contain significant amounts of short chain branches, particularly the silica based catalyst. Gas chromatography has detected olefins of even carbon number in the liquid phase of the polymerization reactions with the catalysts. This suggests that there are several sites on the catalysts. One produces long chain polymers and another produces C2n olefins where n is an integer 22. The incorporation of these olefins in the growing polymer chain could account for the observed ethyl and butyl branches. However, it does not account for the methyl branching since propylene is absent in the reactor liquid phase.The methyl branching apparently results from some other unknown characteristic of the polymerization mechanism. Example VI Portions of the dual chromium catalyst systems enumerated inExample II, Methods A 2 and B 2, were employed in ethylene polymerization as described before.

Although not shown in the Table it was observed that induction period of about 20 55 minutes Run 20 , typically noted with hexavalentCr catalysts, was reduced to about 5 minutes upon addition of Cr4 ThS a. This suggests that the added Cr compound reduces the supported Cr 6 center so that initiation of polymerization is not entirely dependent upon reduction of the center with ethylene alone. The variation in productivity observed ranged from 4100 in Run 20 to 7700 in Run 21 to 1420 in Run 22 also suggests that catalytic activity is increased by addition of the organochromium compound but an excess of it can depress activity. Example VII Ethylene Polymerization Prereacted Hexavalent Chromium Catalyst and Cr4 TMS 8 A series of ethylene polymerization runs were carried out as described in Example III wherein the designated activated supported hexavalent chromium catalyst, each containing about 1 weight percent chromium, was contacted with a solution of Cr4 TMS 8 as before. The 963 cogel catalyst, prior to impregnation with the solution of Cr4 TMS 8, was activated by heating it for 3 hours at 8000C in carbon monoxide, cooled to 7000C in nitrogen, then heated at 7000C for 3 hours in dry air. It was cooled and stored in nitrogen pending further use. The 969MSB Cr catalyst component was activated 3 hours in air at 8O00C. A portion of each treated catalyst was then tested in ethylene polymerization. The results are set forth in Table V.

The results in Runs 31 33 show that increasing theCr4 TMS 8 component from about 0.03 to 0.19 mmole g catalyst gives a composite catalyst which yields polymers with increasing melt index about 0.2 to 0.6 , decreasing density about 0.962 to 0.947 g cc at constant reactor conditions.The results in Run 34 37 indicate that increasing reactor temperature and or the addition of hydrogen can significantly increase polymer melt index. Control run 27 29 show the results obtained with a prior art supported hexavalent chromium catalyst alone.

The linear high density polyethylene of Run 29 is shown to be essentially free of short chain branching as expected. The terpolymer of Run 28 shows some short chain branching amounting to about 0.85 mole percent total, a Et Bu ratio of about 0.5 and a density of 0.9392 g cc. However, with the multiple chromium catalysts of this invention, the polymers of invention Runs 21 density of 0.9399 g cc , 24 density of 0.9372 g cc , 26 density of 0.9406 g cc and 36 density of 0.9382 g cc , have total short chain branching ranging from about 1.02 1.60 mole and Et Bu ratios ranging from about 0.7 1.The differences are significant and demonstrate that it is possible to make medium to low density ethylene polymers linear low density polyethylene by employing ethylene as the sole monomer with the catalyst systems of this invention. Example IX A series of ethylene polymerization runs was made as before at 950C using catalysts formed as before by contacting an activated catalyst comprising hexavalent chromium about 1 weight percent chromium based on the catalyst weight supported on the silica titania cogel previously described with the specified organochromium compound. the chromium compounds employed were a dicyclopentadienylchromium, abbreviatedCr CP 2 b dicumenechromium O , abbreviated Cr CUM 2 and cited inMcDaniel, U.S. Patent 4,369,295 bis 2,4 dimethylpentadienyl chromium II , abbreviated Cr DHPD 2 and Cr TMS 4 and Cr4 TMS 8, both described in this application.

The results in Table VII indicate that the type of organochromium compound employed in the precontacting of the activated, supported hexavalent catalyst has a significant effect on catalyst activity as well as on the physical properties of the resulting polymers.Based on equivalents of organochromium added, comparison Run 38 shows that Cr CP 2 yielded a dead catalyst. The compound Cr4 TMS 8, inventionRun 42, was the most effective in lowering polymer density suggesting that significant short chain branching is present as verified in earlier examples. The other organochromium compounds, in order of effectiveness in lowering polymer density are Cr CUM 2, Cr TMS 4 and Cr DMPD 2, in comparison Runs 39, 41, 40, respectively. Example X A series of ethylene polymerization runs was made as before at 1000C using catalysts formed by contacting the previously described activated hexavalent chromium silica titania catalyst with eitherCr CUM 2 or Cr4 TMS 8 and isolating the catalyst compositions. At the conclusion of each run, the reactor liquid phase was sampled by gas chromatography to determine the presence of ethylene oligomers. The column could not separate butenes from the isobutane diluent employed in the reactor, hence values for 1 butene are missing. Higher olefins are of greater concern, however, due to the greater probability of being retained in recovered polymer fluff in vapor or liquid form and causing odor, smoking and sticky problems in processing. Polymerization time in run 43 was 12 minutes, in run 44 was 11 minutes, in run 45 was 15 minutes and in run 46 was 60 minutes.The results obtained are given inTable VIII.

The control catalyst also produced significant amounts of C1O. C12 and higher olefins whereas none were detected with invention catalyst. Example XI Ethylene as the sole monomer was polymerized in a stirred 2 liter reactor in the gas phase with a dual valence chromium catalyst.The catalyst was prepared under the usual dry, oxygen free conditions by impregnating a previously activated 963 cogel catalyst see Example VII containing about 1 weight percent hexavalent chromium with sufficient Cr4 TMS 8 dissolved in n pentane to provide 0.2 mg atom of added divalentCr per gram of cogel catalyst. This corresponds to about 1 weight percent added diva lent Cr as Cr4 TMS 8 based on the weight of cogel catalyst plus Cr compound. Following impregnation, the solvent was removed by heating the mixture under a nitrogen stream to dryness at about 500 600C. The dual valence chromium catalyst was stored under nitrogen. Polymerization was conducted in the 2 liter stirred reactor by purging it with nitrogen, heating it to near the desired temperature, charging the catalyst and pressuring the reactor to the specified level with ethylene. As before, ethylene was supplied on demand from a pressurized reservoir during each 1 hour run. The reactor temperature was somewhat difficult to control under the conditions employed. The reactor temperatures, pressures and resulting polymer properties are shown in Table IX.

The above example shows that the catalyst described can be utilized not only in the liquid phase but also in the gas phase to produce polymers from ethylene having, however, a significant amount of short branches of even carbon number.
