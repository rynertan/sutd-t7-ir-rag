# RING SEAL FOR CONTAMINANT TRAPPING

## Abstract
A ring seal between a housing 8 and a rotatable shaft 3 comprises first, second and third ring members 5, 6, 7 . The first member 5 has a first annular flange 13 adjacent the housing 8 , a second annular flange 14 adja cent the shaft and a third annular flange 15 projecting radi ally towards the second flange from the first flange to define a channel 16 between the flanges and an outer wall 25 . This wall has at its lowest point in the channel an opening 17 to the outer surface. The first member is fixed to the housing and the second and third members are fixed to the shaft. The second member has a portion positioned with an outwardly directed face facing an inwardly directed face of the first member and the second member has a flange 20 which extends into the channel between the second and third flan ges 6, 7 . A seal is thus provided which traps contaminants in the channel 16 , allowing them to flow back to the atmo sphere through the opening 7 whether the shaft is rotating or in a static position.
