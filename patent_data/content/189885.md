# VOLTAGE REGULATOR FOR GENERATOR USED IN AUTOMOBILE

## Abstract
In a generator charging a battery on an automobile with output voltage thereof, a voltage regulator has a constant voltage source 20 first and second voltage dividers 91, 92 and 94, 95 dividing the voltage of the constant voltage source 20 a series circuit consisting of a thermo sensitive element 101 103 and a resistor 93 and being connected to the middle point of the first voltage divider 91, 92 a first diode 104 having an anode connected to the middle point of the first voltage divider a second diode 105 having an anode connected to the middle point of the second voltage divider 94, 95 and a third diode 106 having a cathode connected to both the cathodes of the first and the second diode 104 and 105 and supplying a reference voltage V
