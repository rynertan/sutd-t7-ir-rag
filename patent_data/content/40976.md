# Rotary actuators.

## Abstract
A piston rack rotary fluid pressure actuator includes a housing 10 enclosing cylinder 11 in which is dispos ed a pair of pistons 12, 13 biased by springs 14 and 15 towards the centre of the cylinder. Each piston has a rack portion 16, 17 engaged with a pinion 19 on output shaft 18 , and elements of low friction material 20, 21 are incorporated into the outer surface of the rack portions 16, 17 to take up forces tending to displace the rack bearing portions towards the cylinder. Annuli 30, 31 of incompressible material keyed to the shaft 18 make rolling contact with runways 32, 33 on the rack bearing portions and have diameters equal to that of the pitch circle diameter of the teeth of pinion 19 . By this means contact is maintained be tween the low friction elements 20, 21 and the cylinder and over meshing between the teeth of pinion 19 and racks 16, 17 is prevented.

## Description
ROTARY ACTUATORS The invention relates to piston rack rotary actuators. A disadvantage of a piston rack rotary actuator which includes a pair of pistons which are displaceable towards and away from one another along a pair of opposed cylinders is that the pistons have a tendency to cock or turn in the cylinders thereby jamming and or damaging the radial inner surface or surfaces of the cylinders and the seals. In UK Patent 1,251,805 this was overcome by providing guide members to constrain the piston to move only in an axial direction, the piston sliding on stationary guide members. However, in some designs, it is desirable to have a large pinion on which the racked piston acts and it is not possible conveniently to provide guide members, such as described in UK Patent 1,251,805. A solution is proposed in US Patent 4,167,897 where a rack bearing portion of each piston is provided with low coefficient friction elements between that portion and an internal surface of a cylinder to prevent scoring and to maintain the rack in contact with a pinion of the actuator. In the US specification, annuli are also provided of low friction elastomeric or synthetic resin material at each side of the pinion which slide on runways provided on each side of the rack portions.Such annuli are provided to tend to urge the racked portions of the pistons towards the low friction element referred to above. It is an object of the invention to provide an improved piston rack actuator. According to the invention there is provided a piston rÅack rotary fluid pressure actuator, comprising a housing including a cylinder having a central longitudinal axis a piston disposed coaxially within said cylinder and arranged for linear movement substantially parallel to said central longitudinal axis of said cylinder under the influence of a difference in fluid pressure created on opposite sides of said piston, said piston including a rack bearing portion having a toothed rack rigidly connected to said piston an actuator output shaft rotatably mounted in said housing and disposed transverse to said central longitudinal axis of said cylinder a pinion rigidly affixed to said actuator output shaft and disposed so that teeth of the pinion engage with teeth of the rack at least one element having a low coefficient of friction being disposed between and in contact with said rack bearing portion of said piston and the adjoining portion of the internal surface of said cylinder whereby any forces which tend to displace said rack bearing portion of said piston toward said adjoining portion of said internal surface of said cylinder are counteracted, characterised by spaced annuli of non compressible material rigidly fixed for rotation with said actuator output shaft in the vicinities of the opposite ends of said teeth of said pinion, said annuli having diameters equal to the pitch circle diameter of said teeth of said pinion, two spaced flat runways provided on said rack bearing portion of said piston and said annuli forming a rolling contact with the runways on the piston during operation of the actuator to help to maintain contact between each said low friction element and the internal surface of said cylinder, to prevent rotational movement of said piston, and to prevent over meshing of the teeth of the rack and the, pinion. According to another aspect of the invention there is provided a housing including a cylinder having a central longitudinal axis two pistons disposed coaxially within said cylinder and arranged for linear movements substantially parallel to said central longitudinal axis of said cylinder either towards or away from one another under the influence of a difference in fluid pressure created on opposite sides of each of said pistons, each said piston including a rackbearing portion having a toothed rack rigidly connected to said piston an actuator output shaft rotatably mounted in said housing and disposed transverse to said central longitudinal axis of said cylinder at the mid length point of said cylinder a pinion rigidly affixed to said actuator output shaft and disposed between said racks integral with said pistons so that teeth of the pinion engage with teeth of the racks at least one element having a low coefficient of friction being disposed between and in contact with both said rack bearing portion of each piston and the respective portion of the internal surface cf said cylinder whereby any forces which tend to displace said rack bearing portion of each of said pistons toward said.respective portion of said internal surface of said cylinder are counteracted, spaced annuli of non compressible material rigidly fixed for rotation with said actuator output shaft in the vicinities of the opposite ends of said teeth of said pinion, said annuli having diameters equal to the pitch circle diameter of said teeth of said pinion, two spaced flat runways provided on said rack bearing portion of each of said pistons and said annuli forming a rolling contact with the runways on the pistons during operation of the actuator to help to maintain contact between each said element and the internal surface of said cylinder to prevent rotational movement of said pistons, and to prevent over meshing of the teeth of the racks and the pinion. A piston rack rotary fluid pressure actuator according to the invention will now be described by way of example, with reference to the accompanying schematic drawing, in which Figure 1 is a cut away side elevation of the actuator Figure 2 is a section through A A of Figure 1 and Figure 3 is an isometric view of one piston and a pinion of the actuator. Referring to the drawings, in Figure 1 a housing 10 encloses a cylinder 11 in which two pistons 12 and 13 are disposed coaxially within the cylinder 11 and spring biased by springs 14 and 15 towards the centre of the cylinder 11.Each piston has a toothed rack portion 16 and 17. An output shaft 18 rotatably mounted in the housing 11 has a toothed pinion 19 keyed to the shaft 18 which engages the teeth of both the racks 16 and 17. Low friction bearing material 21 such as DELRIN Trade Mark is supported in grooves 20 in outer surfaces of the rack portions 16 and 17.Similarly, low friction material 22a, formed as trapezoids, is supported in grooves 22 in each piston 12 and 13. Spaced annuli 30 and 31 best seen in Figure 3 keyed to the shaft 18 and having a diameter equal to the pitch circle diameter of the teeth of the pinion 19 are mounted at opposite ends of those teeth. Two flat runways 32 and 33 are fixed to each of the rack bearing portions 16 and 17 to contact the annuli 30 and 31 respectively when the teeth of the pinion 19 and the teeth of the racked portions 16 and 17 are in correct meshing position. In operation, pressurised air or liquid is supplied into the cylinder 11 between the pistons 12 and 13 to force the pistons 12 and 13 away from each other and the centre of the cylinder 11 and so rotate the shaft 18. When the pressure is reduced the springs 14 and 15 return the pistons towards their central positions. During movement of the pistons 12 and 13, the annuli 30 and 31 rotate with the shaft 18 to form rolling contacts with the.runways 32 and 33. This contact maintains the contacts between the material in the grooves 20 and the walls of the cylinder 11 and at the same time prevents overmeshing of the teeth of the pinion 19 and the teeth of the rack portions 16 and 17, and rotation of the pistons 12 and 13. By foazw the annuli 30 and 31 and the runways 32 and 33 of load bearing material such as anodised aluminium, or say, steel where corrosion is not a problem, there is no tendency for such parts to be compressed or deformed by any forces acting transversely to the axis of the cylinder 11. Further, by arranging for the contact between the annuli 30 and 31 and the runways 32 and 33 to be a rolling contact any tendency for the annuli to stick or slide is overcome. In a prior art proposal, in US Patent 4,167,897, the material used for the annuli being elastomeric or synthetic material there is a tendency for the material to become deformed in use. Further, as the contact is not a rolling contact, both the annuli or sometimes one annulus tends to jam and cause uneven wear which means that excessive wear occurs on the teeth due to overmeshing at one or both sides of the pinion 19 or rack bearing portions.
