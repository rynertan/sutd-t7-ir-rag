# Large scale integrated circuit wafer and method of testing same.

## Abstract
A large scale integrated circuit LSI wafer and a method relates to testing same which allows LSI logic chips to be tested on wafer without necessitating equipment involving high precision step and repeat mechanisms, and which further allows chips to be tested individually in the connected on module environment. The circuit configuration comprises various circuit structures including latches and combinatorial networks. The chips and wafers are configured that the LSSD provi sion already incorporated in the chips can be utilized also for the on wafer and on module testing. The arrangements, which can be made with a cut away or deactivate or an extend usage approach, include five major extensions in the chip image design. These are the incorporation of gating of serial test data output from the chips, the provision if necessary of supplementary latches on chips, the incorpora tion of gating of parallel inputs to the chip core, the incorpora tion of in chip and or interchip connections, which can be done in a self sufficient or a neighbour assisted arrangement, and the utilization of chip layout design for step and repeat juxtaposition. In addition to these in chip extensions, the method requires proper wafer organization and an arrangement of connecting the chip image array to probe contact pads on the wafer.
