# Plasmids, plasmid hosts, and their preparation.

## Abstract
A novel plasmid pUC1061 is obtained by deletion of SIMILAR 2.0 kilobases of DNA from the Streptomyces espinosus plasmid pUC6. This plasmid is useful as a cloning vehicle in recombinant DNA work. For example, using DNA methodology, a desired gene, for example, the glucose isomerase gene, can be inserted into the plasmid and the resulting plasmid can then be transformed into a suitable host microbe which, upon culturing, produces the desired glucose isomerase.
