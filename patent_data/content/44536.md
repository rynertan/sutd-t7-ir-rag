The plant growth regulating effects of the compounds are manifested as for example a stunting or dwarfing effect on the vegetative growth of plants.Such stunting or dwarfing may be useful, for example, in peanuts, cereals and soya bean where reduction in stem growth may reduce the risk of lodging and may also permit increased amounts of fertilizer to be applied. The stunting of woody species is useful in controlling the growth of undergrowth under power lines and the like. Compounds which induce stunting or dwarfing may also be useful in modifying the stem growth of sugar cane thereby increasing the concentration of sugar in the cane at harvest in sugar cane, the flowering and ripening may be controllable by applying the compounds. Stunting of peanuts can assist in harvesting.Growth retardation of grasses can help maintenance of grass swards. The compounds may stunt grasses without significant phytotoxic effects and without deleteriously affecting the appearance, particularly the color, of the grass. This makes such compounds attractive for use on ornamental lawns and on grass verges. They may also have an effect on flower head emergence in for example grasses. The compounds may also stunt weed species present in the grasses examples of such weed species are sedges such as Cyperus spp. and di cotyledonous weeds, for example, daisy, plantain, knotweed, speedwell, thistle, docks and ragwort. The growth of non crop vegetation, for example, weeds or cover vegetation, may be retarded thus assisting in the maintenance of plantation and field crops.In fruit orchards, particularly orchards subject to soil erosion, the presence of grass cover is important. However, excessive grass growth requires sub stantial maintenance. The compounds of the invention could be useful in this situation as they could restrict growth without killing the plants which would lead to soil erosion. At the same time, the degree of competition for nutrients and water by the grass would be reduced and this could result in an increased yield of fruit. In some cases, one grass species may be stunted more than another grass species this selectivity could be useful for example for improving the quality of a sward by preferential suppression of the growth of undesirable species. The dwarfing may also be useful in miniaturizing ornamental, household, garden and nursery plants, for example, poinsettias, chrysanthemums, carnations, tulips and daffodils. As indicated above, the compounds may also be used to stunt woody species. This property may be used to control hedgerows or to shape fruit trees, for example, apples. The plant growth regulating effect may, as implied above, manifest itself in an increase in crop yield. In the potato, vine control in the field and inhibition of sprouting in the store may be possible. Other plant growth regulating effects caused by the compounds may include alteration of leaf angle and promotion of tilleing in monocotyledonous plants. The former effect may be useful for example in altering the leaf orientation of, for example, potato crops thereby letting more light into the crops and inducing an increase in phytosynthesis and tuber weight. By increasing tillering in monocotyledonous crops, for example, rice, corn and soybeans, the number of flowering shoots per unit area may be increas ed thereby increasing the overall yield of such crops. In grass swards an increase in tillering could lead to a denser sward which may result in increased resilience in wear. The treatment of plants with the compounds may lead to the leaves developing a darker green color and delay senescence in crops thereby leading to improved pod fill in soybeans, for example. The compounds may inhibit, or at least delay, the flowering of sugar beet and thereby may increase sugar yield. They may also reduce the size of sugar beet without reducing significantly the sugar yield thereby enabling an increase in planting density to be made. Similarly in other root crops, such as, for example, turnip, swede, mangold, parsnip, beetroot, yam and cassava, it.may be possible to increase the planting density. The compounds could be useful in restricting the vegetative growth of cotton thereby leading to an increase in cotton yield. The compounds may be useful in rendering plants resistant to stress since the compounds can delay the emergence of plants grown from seed, shorten stem height and delay flowering. These properties could be useful in preventing frost damage in countries where there is significant snow cover in the winter since then the treated plants would remain below the snow cover during the cold weather. Further the compounds may provide drought or cold resistance in certain plants. In carrying out the plant growth regulating method of the invention, the amount of compound to be applied to regulate the growth of plants will depend upon a number of factors, for example the particular compound selected for use, and the identity of the plant species whose growth is to be regulated. However, in general an application rate of 0.05 to 20, preferably 0.1 to 5, kg per hectare is used.However, on certain plants even application rates within these ranges may give undesired phytotoxic effects. Routine tests may be necessary to determine the best rate of application of a specific compound for any specific purpose for which it is suitable. The compounds may be used as such plant growth regulating purposes but are more conveniently formulated into compositions for such usage. The invention thus provides also a plant growth regulating composition comprising a compound of Formula I or II or a phytopharmaceutically ac ceptable salt thereof as hereinbefore defined, and an inert carrier or diluent. It also provides a method of regulating the growth of a plant which method comprises applying to the plant, to seed of the plant or to the locus of the plant or seed a plant growth regulating compound as hereinbefore defined. The plant growth regulating compounds of this invention can be applied in a number of ways, for example they can be formulated or unformulated, directly to the foliage of a plant, or they can be applied also to bushes and trees, to seeds or to other medium in which plants, bushes or trees are growing or are to be planted, or they can be sprayed on, dusted on or applied as a cream or paste formulation, or they can be applied as a vapor. Application can be to any part of the plant, bush or tree, for example to the foliage, stems, branches or roots, or to soil surrounding the roots, for systemic activity, or to the seed before it is planted. The term plant as used herein includes seedlings, bushes and trees. The compounds are preferably used for agricultural and horticultural purposes in the form of a composition. The type of composition used in any instance will depend upon the particular purpose envisaged. The compositions may be in the form of dusting powders or granules comprising the active ingredient and a solid diluent or carrier, for example fillers such as kaolin, bentonite, kieselguhr, dolomite, calcium carbonate, talc, powdered magnesia, Fuller s earth, gypsum Hewitt s earth, diatomaceous earth and China clay. Such granules can be preformed granules suitable for application to the soil without further treatment. These granules can be made either by impregnating pellets of filler with the active ingredient or by pelleting a mixture of the active inredient and powdered filler. Compositions for dressing seed, for example, may comprise an agent, for example a mineral oil, for assisting the adhesion of the composition to the seed.Alternatively the active ingredient can be formulated for seed dressing purposes using an organic solvent, fox example n methylpyrrolidone or dimethylformamide. The compositions may also be in the form of dispersible powders, granules or grains comprising a wetting agent to facilitate the dispersion in liquids of the powder or grains which may contain also fillers and suspenaing agents. The aqueous dispersions or emulsions may be prepared by dissolving the active ingredient in an organic solvent optionally containing wetting, dispersing or emulsifying agents and then adding the mixture to water which may also contain wetting, dispersing or emulsifying agents.As example of suitable crganic solvents there may be mentioned, for example, ethylene dichloride, isopropyl alcohol, propylene glycol, diacetone alcohol, toluene, kerosene, methylnaphthalene, the xylenes, trichloroethylene, furfuryl alcohol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, and glycol ethers such as 2 ethoxy ethanol and 2 butdxyethanol. The compositions to be used as sprays may also be in the form of aerosols wherein the formulation is held in a container under pressure in the presence of a propellant, such as, for example, fluorotrichloromethane or dichlorodifluoromethane. The plant growth regulating compounds can be mixed in the dry state with a pyrotechnic mixture to form a composition suitable for generating in enclosed spaces a smoke containing the compounds. Alternatively, the compounds may be used in z micro encapsulated form. By including suitable additives, for example additives for improving the distribution, adhesive power and resistance to rain on treated surfaces, the different compositions can be better adapted for various utilities. The plant growth regulating compounds can also be used as mixtures with fertilizers. Compositions comprising only granules of fertilizer incorporating, for example coated with, the p n growth regulating compound, are preferred.Such granules suitably contain up to 25 by weight of the compound. The invention therefore also provides a fertilizer composition comprising the plant growth regulation compound of Formula I. The corpositions may also be in the form of liquid preparatiors or use as dips or sprays which are generally aqueous dis ersions or emulsions containing the active ingredient in the presence of one or more surfactants, for example, wetting agents, dispersing agents, emulsifying agents or suspending agents. These agents can be cationic, anionic or non ionic agents. Suitable cationic agents are quaternary ammonium compounds, for example cetyltrimethylammonium bromide. Suitable anionic agents are soaps, salts of aliphatic monoesters of sulfuric acid, for example sodium lauryl sulfate, and salts of sulfonated aromatic compounds, for example sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate, sodium, calcium or ammonium lignosulfonate, butylnaphthalene sulfonate, and a mixture of sodium diisopropyl and triisopropyl naphthalene sulfonates. Suitable non ionic agents are the condensation products ofethylene oxide with fatty alcoho.ls such as oleyl or cetyl alcohol, or with alkyl phenols such as octyl or nonylphenol and octylcresol. Other non ionic agents are the partial esters derived from long chain fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, the condensation products of the acid partial esters with ethylene oxide, and the lecithins. Suitable suspending agents are hydrophilic colloids, for example polyvinylpyrrolidone and sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and the vegetable gums, for example gum acacia and gum tragacanth. The compositions for use as aqueous dispersions or emulsions are general supplied in the form of a concentrate containing a high proportion of the active ingredient.The concentrates are then diluted with water before use.These concentrates often should be able to withstand storage for prolonged periods and after such storage be capable of dilution with water in order to form aqueous preparations which remain homogeneous for a sufficient time to enable them to be applied by conventional spray equipment. The concentrates may conveniently contain up to 95 , suitably 10 85 , for example 25 60 , by weight of the active in gredient. These concentrates suitably contain organic acids, for example, alkaryl or aryl sulfonic acids such as xylenesulfonic acid or dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid, since the presence of such acids can increase the solubility of the active ingredient in the polar solvents often used in the concentrates. The concentrates suitably contain also a high proportion of surfactants so that sufficiently stable emulsions in water can be obtained.After dilution to form aqueous preparations, such preparations may contain varying amounts of the. active ingredient depending upon the intended purpose, but an aqueous preparation containing 0.0005 or 0.01 to 10 by weight of active ingredient may be used. The compositions of this invention can comprise also other compounds having biological activity, for example, compounds having similar or complementary plant growth regulating activity or compounds having herbicidal or insecticidal or fungicidal activity. The fungicidal compound can be for example one which is capable of combatting ear diseases of cereals such as wheat, seed and soil borne diseases and downy and powdery mildews on grapes and powdery mildew and scab on apple and the like.Examples of the bther fungicidal compounds are imazalil, benomyl, carbendazim . BCM , thiophanate methyl, captafol, captan, sulphur, dithiocarbamates, carba,thiins, copper oxychloride, triforine, dodemorph, tridemorph, dithianon, pyrazophos, binapacryl, quinomethionate, panoctine, furalaxyl, aluminum trio ethyl phosphonate , DPX3217, ethirimol, dimethirimol, bupirimate, chlorothalonil, Chevron RE 20615, vinclozolin, procymidone, iprodione and metaxanine. The other plant growth regulating compound can be one which controls weeds or seedhead formation, improves the level or. longevity of the plant growth regulating activity of the compounds of this invention, selectively controls the growth of the less desirable plants such as grasses or causes the plant growth regulating compound of Formula 1 to act faster or slower as a plant growth regulating agent.Some of these other agents will be herbicides. Examples of suitable agents are the gibberellins such as GA3, GA4, or GA , the auxins such as indoleacetic acid, indolebutyric acid, naphthoxyacetic acid, naphthylacetic acid, phenoxyacetic acids such as 2,4 D or MCPA, substituted benzoic acids such as TIBA and morphactins such as chlorfluorecol and the cytokinins such as kinetin, benzylademine, BAP, diphenylurea and benzimidazole. Also included would be maleic hydrazide, glyphosate, giyphosine, long chain fatty alcohols and acids, dikegulac, substituted quaternary ammonium and phosphonium compounds such as CCC or Phosfon D, carbetamide, asulam, abscissic acid, isopyrimol, and hydroxybenzonitriles such as bromoxynil.
