# A hub for a concrete saw blade.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a hub for supporting a di amond edged concrete saw such that the saw can make a cut while lying flush against a planar surface such, for example, as a floor or wall. The hub 10 is characterised by a rearwardly opening doughnut shaped annular groove 44 bordering its hollow central core area which can receive cooling water delivered thereto from a stationary source in the form of an inlet pipe 48 and then disperse the water centrifugally on to the remote surface of the blade mounted thereon by means of passages 88 leading out of the groove and passing through the hub on to said remote surface of the blade closely adjacent the central opening therein.
