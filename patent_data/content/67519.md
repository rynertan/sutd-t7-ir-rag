# Telecommunications system.

## Abstract
A data processing system having a large number of data processors 1 4 grouped in clusters is used in the control of a telecommunications exchange. The arrangement is such that any one of the processors may pass data to any other of the processors, in its own cluster by way of a synchronous data bus 5 , or on other clusters by way of an interface 18, 19 and an asynchronous data bus 22 . The arrangement permits larger number of processors 1 4 to have access to storage without undue delay in access to stored data.
