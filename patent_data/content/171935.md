## Description
TREAD RUBBER COMPOSITION This invention relates to a tread rubber composition, and more particularly to a tread rubber composition for high performance racing tires containing a copolymer of an aromatic vinyl compound and a conjugated diene and having a large hysteresis loss, improved gripping force on the road surface. good strength at break and wear resistance. good heat resistance and small temperature dependence of dynamic modulus. The term high performance racing tire as used herein means racing tires for two wheeled and four wheeled vehicles. In order to enhance the gripping force on the road surface of racing tires, butyl rubber having a large hysteresis loss, halogenated butyl rubber, and emulsion polymerizied styrene butadiene copolymer rubber having a high content of bound styrene have hitherto been used in the treads of such tires. However, the rubber materials having a large hysteresis loss such as butyl rubber have a poor covulcanization property with diene rubber and strength at break as compared with diene rubbers such as high cis polyisoprene rubber, natural rubber, high cis polybutadiene rubber, and emulsion polymerized styrene butadiene copolymer rubber. Further, the emulsion polymerized styrene butadiene copolymer rubber having a high content of bound styrene frequently causes blow outs under severe service conditions as in racing and is therefore not satisfactory. The present invention accordingly aims to overcome.or at least mitigate, the aforementioned problems of the prior art and to provide a tread rubber composition particularly for high performance racing tires having an improved covulcanization property between rubber components, a large hysteresis loss, good heat resistance, good strength at break and wear resistance and small temperature dependence of dynamic modulus. The present inventors have made various studios in order to meet the above problems and have found that a rubber composition comprising a particular copolymer of an aromatic vinyl compound and a conjugated diene achieves a satisfactory result. According to the invention, there is provided a tread rubber composition particularly for high performance racing tires, comprising at least 10 by weight of a copolymer of an aromatic vinyl compound and a conjugated diene. which is obtained by polymerization reaction in a hydrocarbon solvent using an organolithium compound as a polymerization initiator, based on the total weight of rubber components. The copolymer of an aromatic vinyl compound and a conjugated diene to be used in the invention is a copolymer obtained by copolymerizing the aromatic vinyl compound with the diene compound and is referred to as an aromatic vinyl diene copolymer hereinafter. The aromatic vinyl compound may be suitably styrene, p methylstyrene, m methylstyrene, p tert butylstyrene, a methylstyrene, chloromethyl styrene, or vinyl toluene. Among these, styrene, p methyl styrene and a methylstyrene are preferred . styrene is particularly preferred. The diene compound may be suitably butadiene, isoprene. pentadiene, or 2.3 dimethyl butadiene. Among these, butadiene is preferred. According to the invention, the aromatic vinyl diene copolymer may be blended with various diene rubbers. In particular, emulsion polymerized styrene butadiene copolymer rubber having a high content of bound styrene. acrylonitrile butadiene copolymer rubber, and chloroprene rubber are preferred as diene rubbers having a glass transition temperature Tg of not less than 600C. The emulsion polymerized styrene butadiene copolymer rubber having the high bound styrene content is most preferable in view of the gripping property and strength at break. In this case, the high bound styrene content means preferably 30 60S. When the amount of the aromatic vinyl diene copolymer is less than 10 by weight of the total weight of rubber components, the effect of improving the wear resistance, heat resistance and gripping property is small. According to the invention, therefore, the amount of the aromatic vinyldiene copolymer is required to be not less than 10 by weight and is preferably not less than 30 by weight. In the aromatic vinyldiene copolymer, a rate of vinyl bond unit in the whole of the diene polymerized portion is preferably within a range of 30 80 , more preferably 35 75 . When the rate of vinyl bond unit is less than 30 , the heat resistance may become poor and the temperature dependence of dynamic modulus may become large. while when the rate of vinyl bond unit exceeds 80 , the strength at break may become poor. Further. the content of bound aromatic vinyl compound in the aromatic vinyl.diene copolymer is preferably within a range of 10 50 by weight, more preferably 15 40 by weight, more particularly 25 4OS by weight. When the content of bound aromatic vinyl compound is less than 10 , the hysteresis loss may become small and the strength at break may become poor, while when the content of bound aromatic vinyl compound exceeds 50 , the block sequence of the bound aromatic vinyl compound may increase to make the temperature dependence of dynamic modulus over a service temperature range 20 150 C large and also the strength at break may become poor. In the diene rubber to be blended with the aromatic vinyl diene copolymer. the glass transition temperature Tg is preferably not less than 600C having regard to the desired wear resistance, heat resistance and gripping property. 1000C The Mooney viscosity ML1 4 of the aromatic vinyl diene copolymer is not critical, but is preferably within a range of 20 100, more preferably 30 80, as an oil extended rubber in view of the rupture properties and processability. In order to provide a large hysteresis loss, it is preferable that the rubber composition contains 50 200 parts by weight of an extender oil based on 100 parts by weight of the rubber components excluding oil. When the amount of the extender oil exceeds 200 parts by weight, the strength at break and wear resistance may become poor. while when the amount of extender oil is. less than 50 parts by weight, the gripping force on the road surface is reduced. The amount of the extender oil is more preferably 55 200 parts by weight, more particularly 60 170 parts by weight. The use of 80 170 parts by weight of aromatic oil is most preferable having regard to the desired gripping property on the road surface. The extender oil is preferably an aromatic oil having a viscosity gravity constant of 0.900 1.100. more preferably 0.920 0.990 as measured according to ASTMD2501. In order to enhance the strength at break, it is preferable that the aromatic vinyl diene copolymer is previously added with the extender oil corresponding to not less than 30 by weight of total oil to form an oil extended aromatic vinyl diene copolymer and then blended with the other diene rubber, if necessary. When the amount of the extender oil is less than 30 by weight, the strength at break lowers. Preferably, the amount of the extender oil added to the aromatic vinyl diene copolymer is not less than 50 by weight of total oil. As other additives, use may be made of for example carbon black, fillers, vulcanization accelerators, and vulcanizing agents. In the rubber composition according to the invention. when the temperature dependence of dynamic modulus in the vulcanizate G 100 C G 200C is less than 0.2e, the temperature dependence of strength at break and hysteresis loss may become too large, so that the performances may not be stably obtained over the service temperature range of 20 150 C. The aromatic vinyl.diene copolymer according to the invention may be produced by various methods. As a typical example of the industrial method, 1,3 butadiene containing a small amount of 1,2 butadiene is copolymerized with an aromatic vinyl compound in a reaction tank or tower using an organolithium compound as an initiator in the presence of a hydrocarbon solvent such as ether or tertiary amine. In this case. a proper amount of silicon halide. adipic diester. alkylene carbonate, or divinyl benzene is added at a final stage of the copolymerization reaction, if necessary, to conduct the coupling reaction, whereby the resulting copolymer is modified. Alternatively, either the catalyst or the monomer or both may be further supplemented to the above reaction system. The glass transition temperature Tg is defined by a temperature when changing the curve of heat capacity plotted against temperature measured by means of a DSC differential scanning calorimeter . The invention will be further described with reference to the following illustrative Examples. The polymer used in each example is a sample obtained by the following method and has analytical results shown in Table 1. Sample A Into a reaction vessel of 20 Q capacity provided with a stirrer and a jacket were continuously charged 20 gamin of butadiene containing 100 ppm of 1,2 butadiene and 10 g min of styrene as a monomer, 150 g min of cyclohexane and 1.5 g min of tetrahydrofuran as a solvent, and 0.043 g of n butyllithium as a catalyst to 100 g of the monomer, during which the temperature of the reaction vessel was controlled to 700C. At the top outlet of the reaction vessel, silicon tetrachloride was continuously added to the resulting reaction product at a rate of 1 4 mole per n butyllithium, which was introduced into a second reaction vessel connected to the upper portion of the reaction vessel to conduct the coupling reaction.At the outlet of the second reaction vessel, 0.5 part by weight of di tert butyl p cresol and 37.5 parts by weight of aromatic oil were added based on 100 parts by weight of the rubber component, which was subjected to desolvating and drying treatments in usual manner to thereby obtain a polymer of a sample A.Sample D The polymerization reaction was conducted in the first reaction vessel according to the same compounding recipe as in the sample A, and further continued at 700C in the second reaction vessel by continuously charging 15 g min of butadiene and 7 g min of styrene as a monomer without the coupling reaction. The resulting reaction product was added with 0.5 part by weight of di tert butyl p cresol and 37.5 parts by weight of aromatic oil based on 100 parts by weight of the rubber component at the outlet of the second reaction vessel and then subjected to desolvating and drying treatments in usual manner.Samples G and H The same procedure as in the sample A was repeated except that the amount of tetrahydrofuran used was changed.Samples B, E and F The same procedure as in the sample A was repeated except that the charging rate of the monomer was changed.

On the other hand. the rubber composition ofComparative Example 1 has a low blow out temperature and poor heat resistance, wear resistance and a ripping property on the road surface. As mentioned above, according to the invention, the heat resistance, wear resistance and gripping property on the road surface are simultaneously satisfied in a tread rubber composition for high performance racing tires used under severe service conditions by using the aromatic vinyldiene copolymer, which is obtained by polymerization in the presence of an organolithium compound as an initiator. alone or in admixture with another diene rubber at a pre determined mixing ratio.
