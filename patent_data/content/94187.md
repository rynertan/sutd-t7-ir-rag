## Description
Exterior Rear View Mirrors This invention relates to exterior rear view mirrors and has particular application to the provision of an exterior mirror which can be temporarily fitted to a motor car which is towing a trailer or caravan. It is well known that it is difficult to obtain a satisfactory rear view from a motor car which is towing a trailer or carvan. This is because the mirrors originally fitted to the towing vehicle do not project laterally to a sufficient extent to clear the towed vehicle. It is therefore necessary to provide additional mirrors mounted on relatively long arms and with relatively large reflective surfaces. The wind resistance of these mirrors exerts large forces on the mountings and generate substantial vibrations with the result that it is necessary to use a system of multiple attachment points. One such system is disclosed in DE A 2726446, comprising a three point attachment system employing a complex arrangement of folding and sliding arms to enable the mirror to be folded.back against the vehicle body in the event of impact. The present invention is concerned with the provision of a rear view mirror for use when towing a trailer or caravan which can be folded back against the body of the vehicle in the event of impact but which is not subject to the foregoing complexities. According to the invention, in a rear view mirror assembly comprising a base member adapted to be secured to a side panel of a vehicle body without piercing such panel, an arm mounted on a central zone of the base member for pivotal movement about a substantially vertical axis under the effect of a predetermined force and a mirror head mounted on the arm, the base member comprises a first limb extending upwardly from the central zone and having a hook like formation for engaging with a horizontally extending, inwardly facing edge of said side panel and second and third arms extending substantially horizontally from said central zone in opposite directions so as to abut said side panel, with an elastic strap extending downwardly from said central zone and having a hook on its free end to engage under a bottom edge of the panel. Preferably, a pair of elastic straps are provided, each having its own hook so as to engage under such bottom edge at spaced locations. The pivotally mounted arm may be connected to the base member by a mounting block having a part cylindrical recess for receiving the arm and clamping means for securing the mounting block to the central zone of the base member with the boundaries of the recess abutting such central zone. Preferably, the clamping means is adapted to secure the block to either of two surfaces of the central zone, such surfaces being inclined at an angle to one another so as to provide two alternative mounting orientations for the arm relative to the base. This enables the mirror assembly to be mounted on a wide variety of types of motor car with the pivot axis of the arm substantially vertical. In order to secure the arm at a desired orientation about its pivot axis relative to the base member, a resilient bush is preferably secured to the end of the arm which is received in the recess. When a force is supplied to the arm exceeding the aforementioned predetermined force, the bush slips relative to the recess, visual index marks on the bush and either the mounting block or the base member being provided to assist in the restoration of the arm to its original position, When the orientation of the arm is to be adjusted, the connection between the bush and the arm is slackened to enable the arm to pivot relative to the bush while leaving the index marks in alignment with one another. An embodiment of the invention will now be described by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a perspective view showing a mirror assembly in accordance with the invention, fitted to a motor car, Figure 2 is a cross sectional view of the base member and clamping means of the mirror assembly shown in Figure 1, Figure 3 is a cross sectional view similar to Figure 2 showing the clamping means attached to the base member at an alternative location. Referring first to Figure 1, a rear view mirror assembly, for use when towing a caravan, comprises a mirror head 10 secured to an arm 12 in a conventional manner. The inboard end of the arm 12 is received in a part cylindrical recess in a block 14 which is secured to one surface 16 of a base member 18 by two clamping screws 20 and 22. The base member 18 is generally T shaped, having two norizontally extending side limbs 24 and 26 carrying respective resilient buffers 28 and 30 on their free ends which abut against the front wing 32 of a motor car 34 without damaging the paint. A third limb 36 of the base member forming the stem of the T shape is cranked at an intermediate point along its length and has a hooklike formation 38 on its free end which engages with the edge 40 of the bonnet opening. Two straps 42 and 44, formed as a single length of elastic material, are attached to the base member 16 on the junction between the three limbs 24, 26 and 36. The strap 42 has a hook 46 on its free end which engages with the edge of the wheel arch 48 formed in the wing 32 while the strap 44 has a hook 50 which engages with the bottom edge of the wing 32 behind the wheel arch. Referring now to Figure 2, the base member 16 consists of a plastic moulding. The hook like formation 38 is formed on the free end of a metal strap 52 which is secured to the limb 34 by screws 54 and 56. The projecting end of the strip 52 is covered by a plastic or rubber sleeve 58 so as to avoid damaging the vehicle paint. The screws 20 and 22, which support the clamping block 14, engage in tapped holes in a metal block 60 which is located in a recess within the base member 16. The elastic material forming the straps 42 and 44 has a loop projecting through a slot 62 into the recess in the base member 18, a rod 64 being received in the loop to prevent withdrawal thereof through the slot 62. The pivoting arm 12 which supports the mirror head 10 is formed from metal tube. A resilient rubber plug 66 has a stem 68, which state is a loose fit in the interior of the tube forming the arm 12, and a head 70 of slighter larger diameter than the external diameter of the arm 12 so as to be an interferance fit in the cylindrical recess in the mounting block 14 thereby to inhibit relative angular movement except when a predetermined torque is exceeded. A screw 72 extends axially through the stem 68 and, when tightened, compresses the latter axially, causing its diameter to expand so as to be clamped firmly against the interior of the arm 12. A slot 74 in the bottom of the mounting block 14 enables an index mark not shown on the head 70 to be viewed. In use, the base member 18 is secured to the vehicle by hooking the hook 36 over the edge 40 of the bonnet opening and then attaching the hooks 46 and 50 to the bottom edge of the wing 32, the index mark on the head 70 having previously been aligned with the slot 62. Next the screw 72 is slackened and the arm 12 set at the required orientation. The screw 72 is then retightened. The assembly is now ready for use. In the event of impact on the mirror head 10 or the arm 12, the latter may be folded backwards or forwards against the side of the vehicle, the head 70 of the plug 66 slipping in the recess in the block 14. Subsequently, a similar but opposite force can be applied manually to the arm 12 to realign the index mark on the plug 66 with the slot 74, thereby restoring the mirror head 10 to its original position. If the distance between the edge 40 of the bonnet opening and the vertical part of the wing 32 is substantially less than that illustrated in Figure 1, the pivot axis of the arm 12 would tend to slope outwardly from the vertical. In use on such vehicles the clamping block 14 may be secured to a surface 76 of the base member 16 which is inclined to the surface 16, as illustrated in Figure 3. Preferably, the base member 16 is mounted with blind holes for the screws 18 and 20 in both surfaces 16 and 76. The assembly is then supplied to the customer in unassembled form and the customer merely has to knock out the ends of the appropriate pair of blind holes and use the screws 18 and 20 to secure the mounting block 14 in the required position. To cater for circumstances when the distance between the edge 40 of the bonnet opening and the vertical part of the wing 32 is substantially greater than that illustrated in Figure 1, the metal strip 52 may be provided with alternative holes not shown for the screws 54 and 56 whereby the strip 52 may be secured to the limb 36 with more of its length projecting from the end thereof. The mirror assembly can be mounted on a motor car in different positions to that illustrated in Figure 1. For example, the base member 18 may be located centrally over the wheel arm 48 and the strap 44 shortened to permit both hooks 46 and 50 to engage with the edge of the wheel arch 48. On cars where the part of the front door below the waist of the vehicle extends in front of the line of the windscreen pillar, the base member 18 may be mounted on the door with the hook 38 engaging with the upper edge of this forwardly projecting part of the door.
