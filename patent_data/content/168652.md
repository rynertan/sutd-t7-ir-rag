# POLYPHENYLENE OXIDE BLENDS CONTAINING IONOMERIC RUBBERS

## Abstract
Polymer blends having improved impact resistance and structural integrity comprise at least one polyphenylene oxide, at least one elastomer containing highly polar ionic e.g., sulfonate substituents, such as a sulfonated EPDM rubber and at least one plasticizer.
