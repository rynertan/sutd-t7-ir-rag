# Seed drill apparatus.

## Abstract
A seed drill apparatus has a seed storage box SB with seed inlet manifold 2 to convey seeds to a rotatable collector wheel 5 having a number of peripheral seed receiving cavities 6 . The seeds are ejected singly, as sisted by a blade edge 11 running in a groove 5a joining the centres of the cavities, through an aperture B in casing 1 to fall into a groove 8 around the periphery of a distributor wheel 7 . The groove 8 is subdivided by stops 9 into arcuate sectors each of which receives a seed. A retardation device 12 catches a seed in the groove 8 and holds same until carried on by a stop 9 . The seed falls to the ground through outlet 13 . The wheel 7 has a peripheral speed equal to the linear speed of mo tion over the ground and wheel 5 rotates more slowly with a reduction dependent on the ratio between the number of cavities 6 and number of stops 9 . The retardation de vice 12 ensures accuracy of spacing by providing for discharge of each seed only when in abutment with a stop 9 .

## Description
TITLE Seed drill apparatus. This invention relates to a seed drill apparatus for sowing seeds with accuracy of spacing along a row. Conventional seed drills have distribution means which frequently result in missed or erratic seed spacing, this being due to the fact that the linear speed component of ejection cannot be accurately matched to the travel speed of the drill. Another disadvantage of such known seed drills arises from the shallow angle of seed ejection causing seeds to bounce on hitting the ground, resulting in large and erratic seed displacements.Accuracy is especially important for even growth of each plant for mechanical harvesting. One object of this invention is to provide an improved construction of apparatus in which accurate and predictable placement of the seeds is made even at high travel speeds of the sowing equipment. According to this invention there is provided a seed drill apparatus having an inlet manifold for a seed supply to convey seeds to a rotatable seed collector wheel including a plurality of seed receiving cavities in spaced location around the periphery thereof, a rotatable seed distributor wheel adjacent said collector wheel and including a groove to receive a seed from a cavity to transfer same to a seed release outlet the oroove having one or more abutment stops with means to bring a seed into contact with the stop prior to release t she outlet. The apparatus is arranged so that tfie fixed drive ratio between the rotational speeds of the collector wheel and the distributor wheel is equivalent to the ratio between the number of receiving cavities in the collactor the end the numher of abutment stops in the distributor wheel. The distributor wheel thus rotates relatively fast end has a peripheral speed equal to the linear travel speed of the apparatus over the ground so that the seeds are released without a linear ground speed component. In an example the collector wheel has fourty two cavities and the distributor wheel has 3 stops with ratio of 14 1 between the wheel speeds. In such an arrangement the seed from a cavity can he released to the distributor wheel over a fairly wide arc and in order to ensure accuracy in release from the distributor wheel to the ground an essential and important feature of the invcntion is te means which brings a seed into abutment with th the stop thus ensuring pDr.cl e spacing of the sowed seeds. This means, herrinafter called 2 retardation means may be mechanical such as a spring finger device to draw the seed back onto the stop, a brush or arm or an air jet. A seed ejector means may he provided to assist displacement of LEch individuel seed from tho collector wheel cavitise perpendicularly downwand into the groove of the distributor whsel, for example a blade may be located in the casing to effect this. Such a blade is preferably in the form of a separate steel insert located between the collector end rSis ributor wheels, the dispensing edge of rich blade lies within 2 thin peripheral groove in tho collector wheel along which prior the seed recepticles are spaced.Potation of the collector wheel causes each seed to encounter the blade edge whereupon the seed is positively and accurately dispensed into the distributor wheel groove. The apparatus preferably includes suitable ground drive means, for example heels, which, through a suitable gearing arrangement, cause both esllector and distributor wheels to rotate. The s eed of either wheel may be made variable by on arram eme mt ofEMI3.1 preferably the amgular rotation of distributer whe l is of the order of twenty times that of the seed sellestor wheel. Additionally, the peripheral sperd of theEMI3.2 distributor wh el is made equal the ground speed at whicht the seed drill apparatus travels. By arranging for the peripheral boundary of both wheels to be enclosed in a casing the seeds are maintained in their individual cavities and within the groove respectively, the casing is preferably a casting of metal and prevents grevitational displacement except here transfer between the wheels occurs and release to the ground. The accurately positioned dispensing blade edge, together with a specific relationship in the drive ratio between the collector and distrihutor wheels ensures that only one seed falls into each section of the seed retaining groove defined by the stops in the distributor wheel. The invention is further described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings illustrating a preferred embodiment and in which Figure 1 is a side elevation in section of e seed drill apparatus according to the invention, Figure 2 is a vie of part of the periphrry of a modified c llector whsel, Figure 3 is a vi of part of the periphery of a modified distributor wheel, EMI5.1 Figure 6 shows a fragmentary view of the casing part and one form of sterdation means,Figure is aEMI5.2 view of the rctardation means looking in direstion as marked on Figure 4, Figure b is a vicw looking in direction X of Figure 4 showing the action of the retardation means, and Figures Es to 5d illustrate verioue further retardatien devices, Thr drawings sho only the cod drill unit with which the invention is concerned and the main construction which may inslude 2 number of unite nith ground bearing wheels, furrow forming end covering coutters is not chaun as such parts are well known. Ocferring firstly to Figure 1, the seed drill apparatus comprises 2 cast a1 low casing 1 provided with a seed inlet manifold 2 which receives bulk seed from aEMI5.3 seed box located above the apparatus. This manifold 2 includes a surplus seed removel gate 3 manually operable to remove unused seed. Within the casing a seraper blade b is situated in close proximity to 2 collector whsel 5 such that pon rotation of the latter only one seed ill enter each cavity 6. The cavities G are of a size only slightly larger than each seed and equidistantly spaced around the circumference of the collector wheel 5. In practice the cavities rill be E standard size to receiveEMI6.1 where the actual seed is small. The heel 5 is readily changeable for different size seeds and is located closely adjacent the casing so that seeds are retained in the cavities eurine rotation in the direction A. The wheel 5 thus serves to collect individual seeds from the supply and transfer them ie at e controlled rate to a discharge point defined by an aperture B in the casing. To effect consistent discharge an edge 11 of a seed ejector blade 10 lies in z thin groovEMI6.2 round the periphery of the collector wheel 5 and passing through each seed cavity 6. The blade contacts each seed as it reaches the aperture B and ejects same to fall into a continuous groove B extending around the periphery of a distributor wheel 7. The distributor wheel 7 is located also in the casing 1 immediately beneath the collector wheel 5. The seed retaining groove 8 is divided into sectors by a number of stops or walls 9 forming abutments and against which each seed dispensed from the collector wheel is brought into firm contact during rotation of the wheel 7 in the final part of the rotation before release of a seed. To achieve this there is provided towards the bottom of the casing 1 and prior to a seed release outlet 13 in the casing 1, a retardation means 12 which serves to retard or hold back a seed which may be in the groove 8 before the stop 9. Rotation of the distributor wheel will then cause the stop to catch up with the seed held by means 12 temporarily and to thereafter dispense such seed through the outlet 13 in the apparatus casing at the correct instant. The retardation device is an important feature for without this the exact point of discharge of the seed, in time, is unpredictable because it can lie anywhere in the sector of the groove between two adjacent stops, and can bounce within the groove resulting in unpredictable spacings. The retardation device 12 is therefore located prior to the release point 14 for the seed, which lies within 10 to 200 before bottom dead centre of the stop 9 in distributor wheel 14. Gearing of both wheels 5 and 7 to the ground drive is by an arrangement of chain and sprockets not shown located on the rear of the cast body 1. Referring to Figures 2 and 3,EMI8.1 in a furtherEMI8.2 of seed cavitiesEMI8.3 around the circumference of the seed collector wheel 5 and in this case identical numbers of grooves 8 are required in the distributor wheel 7, so arranged as to lie in the corresponding vertical plane and each provided with abutment walls or stops 9 to effectively release each seed. This modification is used when it is required to effect seeding at a greater speed or at closer spacing in relation to the forward speed of the drill. In practice the lateral spacing of the seeds is insignificantly small so that, in the case shown, three times as many seeds are sown as in the previous embodiment. Figures 4, 4a and 4b show in more detail the retardation device 12. This comprises a metal carrier 40 with an aperture 41 which engages a spigot 42 in the casing and shaped at 43 to conform with the periphery of the wheel 7.Two spring steel blades 44 are spaced and lie within the groove 8 the blades are shaped to come together at their ends 45 thus trapping any seeds that may lie in the groove until the stop 9 abuts the seed and causes the blades to open to allow same to pass. The seeds will thus be consistently brought into abutment with stop 9 prior to release. A leaf spring 46 ensures that the retardation device is pressed towards the wheel 7 through pivoting about spigot 42. Figure 4b shows the action and positioning of the two springs in the groove, with the groove 8, pin 9 and seed 5 shown in chain dot. Figures 5a to 5d show diagrammatically other forms of retardation devices. In each Figure, the distributor wheel 7 and associated groove 8 remain unchanged. Figure 5a shows a cartridge 12 with a nylon brush 15 Figures 5b and 5c show two forms of spring loaded fingers of TOE, for example, arranged in different configurations 16 and 17 respectively Figure 5d shows a right angle bend pipe 18 providing a low pressure air supply upwards into the groove 8. The seed drill in accordance with this invention thus provides an apparatus and method for precision seed sowing, with greater control and less wastage than with prior art apparatus and enabling relatively high speeds to be achieved.
