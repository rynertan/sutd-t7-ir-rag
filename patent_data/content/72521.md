# SOLID FUELS

## Abstract
The present invention relates to solid fuels comprising a carbonaceous fuel and a combustion accelerating agent encapsulated combustible materials. It is possible to im prove moistureproof characteristics under high humidity, keeping quality by preventing the variations of combustion accelerating agent on standing and of ignition characteris tics.
