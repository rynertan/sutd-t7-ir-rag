# Vinyl aromatic suspension polymerization.

## Abstract
The production of polymer beads from vinyl aromatic monomers, using an inorganic phosphate aqueous suspen sion polymerization process is effected with the addition of 0.0001 to 0.004 percent by weight of a polystyrenesulfonate with the production of beads having a narrow bead size dis tribution. In addition to the improved bead size distribution, large beads can be produced which retain their sphericity.

## Description
VINYL AROMATIC SUSPENS1ON POLYMERIZATION The production of vinyl aromatic polymer beads, such as polystyrene beads, by aqueous suspension systems is a wellknown and commercial practice. Such polymerizations can be effected by the suspension polymerization of a vinyl aromatic monomer in an aqueous medium using an oil soluble polymerization catalyst, with a suspension system comprising a finely divided difficultly water soluble inorganic phosphate, such as tricalcium phosphate, in conjunction with a modifier such as sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate. Such suspension polymerization systems are described, for example, in Grim patent U.S. 2,673,194. The suspension systems described in the Grim patent produce polymer beads having a broad particle size distribution, with average bead diameter being dependent upon the amount of suspending agent and type of modifier in the system. Although the average bead diameter can be somewhat controlled by varying parameters such as the ratio of suspending agent to modifier or the ratio of suspending agent and modifier to monomer, beads are still produced which have a broad bead size distribution. The production of beads which have a narrow size distribution is desired if they are to be used for molded foams. For molding thin walled cups or foams with intricate surfaces, oversize foamed beads cannot be tolerated because they do not fill a mold properly. The result is a molding with holes and or a rough surface.For molding two foot thick billets to be cut into insulation boards, oversized foamed bends can fill the molds readily. However, undersized foamed beads are objectionable because they inhibit the penetration of steam to the center of the billet. Center cut boards from such billets exhibit poor bead to bead fusion and have little or no flexural strength. The customary ranges of bead sizes for typical applications are cups, through 30 on 50 mesh packaging, through 18 on 30 mesh and billets, through 8 on 20 mesh. Each application may require beads differing in molecular weight and in the incorporation of flame retardants, dyes, plasticizers, fastmolding agents, cell nucleating agents, and the like. The median bead size and bead size distribution is normally determined by subjecting a sample to screen analysis using U.S. Standard Sieves. The Distribution Index, DI, is tlien calculated as follows DI standard deviation mm x 100 median bead diameter mm The lower the Distribution Index, the more narrow the bead size distribution and the less unwanted fines or larger beads produced. Attempts to produce large size beads with narrow bead size distribution ranges have been previously made and are continuing. Hohenstein et al., in U. S. 2,672,392, reduced the amount of extremely fine beads by adding less than 0.01 percent based on the monomer of a water soluble persulfate as modifier for the calcium phosphate stabilizer. In U.S. 3,631,014 narrow distribution of bead sizes larger than 300 microns 45 mesh in diameter are produced by the addition of at least 0.0003 percent by weight based on monomer of sodium bisulfite as modifier for the phosphate. In U.S. 3,649,610 narrow distributions of bead sizes larger than 750 microns 25 mesh in diameter are produced by adding at least 0.01 percent by weight based on monomer of certain terminal vicinal hydroxyketo compounds as a modifier for the phosphate.In U.S. 3,755,282 narrow distributions of bead sizes larger than 1200 microns 16 mesh in diameter are produced by adding at least 0.0001 percent by weight based on monomer of M unsaturated carboxylic acids as modifier for the phosphate. In U.S. 4,170,699, bead size distribution is improved for beads larger than 300 microns 45 mesh by the use of a bisulfite or persulfate modifier in the presence of glutamic acid as an adjunct modifier. We have now discovered that by the addition of a sodium polystyrenesulfonate to an inorganic phosphate suspension system, narrow bead size distribution can be effected and the production of large spherical beads, greater than 1000 microns 18 mesh is possible with improved bead sphericity. Although the use of sodium polystyrenesulfona has been suggested as a sole suspending agent for vinyl monomers, as described in British Patent 802,062, it is surprising that use of a few parts per million of such a material in conjunction with a phosphate suspension system would provide any unusual beneflits, such as a narrow bead size distribution or maintenancc of sphericity of 3arge size beads. The bead size distribution is improved and large size spherical beads are produced by addition to an aqueous suspension of a vinyl aromatic monomer containing an oil soluble, free radical producing catalyst, the suspension containing a finely divided difficultly water soluble phosphate suspending agent, between 0.0001 and 0.004 percent by weight, based on monomer, of a sodium polystyrenesulfonate, and subjecting the suspension to an elevated temperature to polymerize the monomer. The present invention is useful in the suspension polymerization of vinyl aromatic monomers such as styrene, paramethylstyrene, mono and dichlorostyrene, as well as the copolymerization of vinyl aromatic monomers with such monomers as divinylbenzene, an alkyl acrylate, allyl acrylate, an alkyl methacrylate, allyl methacrylate, a diallyl ester of a dibasic aliphatic acid, a diallyl ester of a dibasic aromatic acid, butadiene, and polymers capable of further polymerization such as styrene butadiene, styrene isoprene, and polybutadiene rubbers. The finely divided, difficultly water soluble phos phates useful as tf i dispersing agents in the practice of this invention are conventional and are those described, for example, in Grim U.S. Patent No. 2,673,194. They include those finely divided phosphates difficultly soluble in water containing for each phosphate group at least three equivalents of a metal, the carbonate of which is only slightly soluble in water, e.g., tricalcium phosphate, hydroxy apatite, magnesium phosphate, etc. Advantageously, the amount of phosphate to be employed in this invention ranges from about 0.10 to 4.0 by weight based on monomer. Preferably, the phosphate is used in an amount of between 0.2 to 1.2 by weight based on the monomer. The average particle size of polymer beads produced in the suspension polymerization is affected by the total amount of phosphate suspending agent for example, suspension with larger amounts of phosphate suspending agent yields beads of a smaller average particle size. There is added to the aqueous suspension, in addition to the phosphate suspending agent, between 0.0001 to 0.004 percent by weight, based on monomer, of a sodium polystyrenesulfonate. The use of less than about 0.0001 percent by weight will not give the desired suspension while use of greater than about 0.004 shows no improvement over lower amounts. Preferably, the sodium polystyrenesulfonate is added in an amount of about 0.0005 percent by weight, based on the monomer. The sodium polystyrenesulfonates usable in the present invention are those wherein the linear polystyrene has a molecular weight in the range of 20,000 to 500,000. Use of polystyrenes having molecular weights in excess of about 500,000 results in the production of smaller bead sizes and broader bead size distributions. Such are formed preferably as sodium salts of polystyrene sulfonic acid. The degree of sulfonation of the linear polystyrcnes may vary from about 50 percent to 100 percent, i.e., one sulfonate group per styrene group, with substantially 100 percent sulfonation being preferred.Suitable commercial sodium polystyrenesulfonates are produced by NationalStarch and Chemical Co. under the trademark Versa TL for example, Versa TL 70, a substantially 100 percent sulfonated polystyrene having a molecular weight of about 70,000 VersaTL num 47, a substantially 100 percent sulfonated polystyrene having a molecular weight of about 40,000 and Versa TL num 500, a substantially 100 percent sulfonated polystyrene having a molecular weight of about 500,000. The time and temperature cycles for the polymerization may be those conventionally used. Conveniently, the cycles described in the Grim patent, referred to above, or the twostage temperature cycle described by D Alelio, U.S. 2,692,260, is used. The process may be used with monomer to water ratios which vary from about 0.3 to 1.5 parts by weight monomer per 1 part by weight of water. The invention is further illustrated by reference to the following examples, wherein parts are parts by weight unless otherwise indicated. EXANlPlE I To a serics of l2 oz. crown cap bottles there was charged 100 g. water, the amount of tricalcium phosphate TCP , and the amount of sodium polystyrenesulfonate SPS listed in the following Table. The sodium polystyrenesulfonate used was a sodium salt of polystyrenesulfonic acid, Versa TL num 70 a substantially 100 percent sulfonated polystyrene having a molecular weight of about 70,000 . To this aqueous mixture there was added 100 g. of styrene containing 0.25 g benzoyl peroxide and 0.05 g. t butyl perbenzoate. The bottles were sealed and heated with end over end agitation for a period of 6 hours at 900C. to form hard polymer beads. The bottles were cooled to room temperature and the aqueous slurry was then acidified to a pH of about 1.0 to dissolve the phosphate. The resultant beads were separated, washed with water and air dried. The dried beads were subjected to screen analysis using U.S. StandardSieves to determine median bead size and standard deviation from the median size.

EXAMPLE III To a 100 gallon stirred tank reactor there was charged 400 pounds of water, 2 pounds of tricalcium phosphate, 0.0024 pound 1.09 g. of Versa TL num 70 sodium polystyrenesulfonate , 400 pounds of styrene, 1.36 pounds of benzoyl peroxide, and 0.2 pounds of t butyl perbenzoate. The reactor was sealed and the contents heated, with agitation, at 73 revolutions per minute to and at 900C for 5 hours to form hard beads.The bead sizes were determined by sieve analysis to be U.S. Sieve No. Percent on 8 mesh 2.3 on 10mesh 1.5 on 16mesh 60.2 on 20mesh 32.6 on 25mesh 2.4 on 35 mesh 0.6 on pan 0.2 The yield of beads that could be used for billet molding was at least 99 , excluding those that passed a 35mesh, or 96 , excluding those that passed a 20 mesh sieve. Of special interest was the fact that the largest i.e. on 8 mesh beads were all spherical in shape. Other suspension systems i.e. modified calcium phosphates or water soluble polymers such as hydroxyethycellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone or polyvinyl alcohol , that have been tested for making such large beads either fail to suspend the monomer beyond about 60 conversion or produce some off round particles shaped like discs, eggs or beans, in that portion of the product that is retained on a 12 mesh sieve.
