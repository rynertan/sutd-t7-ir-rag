# Method and apparatus for ultrasonic examination of objects.

## Abstract
Apparatus and a method for the ultrasonic examina tion of an object is disclosed. The apparatus comprises means 30 for transmitting pulses of ultrasonic ener gy along a plurality of beams into the object and receiving echoes of the pulses reflected along the beams by acou stic impedance discontinuities within the object, the means in use directing the beams from a plurality of spaced posi tions in a single plane relative to the object and along a plurality of beam directions in the single plane at each spaced position means 31, 32 for forming a first display of informa tion representative of the position of acoustic impedance discountinuities within the object from the echoes received along the plurality of beams and means 34, 35 for determining the shift of echoes from a selected point or region within the object received along the beam in each beam direction from different ones of the spaced positions caused by divergences of the velo city of propagation of ultrasonic energy through the object in the respective beam direction from a median value, and correlating the determinations of the shift of echoes in each beam direction to obtain information representative of the divergences of the velocity of propagation of ultrasonic energy from the median value within the object.
