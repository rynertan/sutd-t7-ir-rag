# Apparatus and method for removing thermocouples from nuclear reactor vessel.

## Abstract
Method and apparatus for automatically releasing an embedded elongate thermocouple from a thermocouple conduit in a nuclear reactor uses a vibrator applied to the thermocouple under a tensile force applied to the thermo couple in a direction to extract the thermocouple. A clamp is applied to the thermocouple at a location above the level of the vessel head, and a vibrator is mounted on the clamp. The thermocouple is withdrawn by pulling it longitudinally upwardly with a predetermined force and, if it does not move, vibrating it by applying vibratory energy at an angle of about 20 of its longitudinal axis of the thermocouple. The pulling force is then periodically in creased in 45 kg increments until the thermocouple is released.
