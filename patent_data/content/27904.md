## Description
PHENANTHROLINE 9 CARBOXYLIC ACID DERIVATIVES, PROCESSESFOR THEIR PRODUCTION, PHADACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONSCONTAINING THEM AND THEIR USE AS PHARMACEUTICALS The invention relates to 2,7 phenanthroline 9 carboxylic acid derivatives, processes for their production, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and their use as pharmaceuticals. GB Patent Specification No. 1,502,405 and JapanesePatent Publication No. 72 42837 broadly disclose a wide range of quinoline carboxylic acid derivatives but do not suggest compounds of the highly specific tricyclic 2,7phenanthroline structure of the compounds of the present invention which have been found to possess particularly beneficial pharmacological properties. The invention thus provides compounds of formula IEMI1.1 wherein R1 represents lower alkyl, lower alkenyl or lower hydroxyalkyl, R2 and R3 represent independently of each other hydrogen, halogen, lower alkyl or lower alkoxy or salts thereof. Any lower alkyl or lower alkoxy radical has preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms, especially 1 or 2 carbon atoms.Lower alkenyl groups contain preferably 2 to 4, in particular 2 carbon atoms. Halogen stands for fluorine, chlorine or bromine, preferably chlorine or bromine. The present invention also provides a process for the production of a compound of formula I which comprises hydrolysing a compound of formula IIEMI2.1 in which R1, R2 and R3 are as defined above and R4 represents lower alkyl. The compounds of formula II may be produced by a process which comprises a reacting a compound of.formula IIIa or IIIbEMI2.2 with a compound of formula VI R1X VI or b cyclising a compound of formula IVaEMI2.3 to produce a compound of formula IIa EMI3.1 whereby in the formulae IIa, IIIa, IIIb, IVa and VIR1, R2, R3 and R4 are as defined above, R5 has the same meaning as R1 but contains 1 less carbon atom and X stands for an, as anion, easily removable group. Examples of such groups X are halogen and a sulphonate radical. The hydrolysis of the compounds of formula II can be carried out analogously to known methods for the hydrolysis of esters e.g. by heating a compound of formula II with an alkaline or alkaline earthmetalhydroxide in a suitably inert solvent such as water. The end products can be isolated and optionally purified analogously to known methods. The cyclisation of the compounds of formula IVa can be carried out in an inert solvent e.g. in diphenylether preferably at raised temperature e.g. above 25O0C. The process a involving compounds of formula IIIb IIIa may be affected in a manner conventional for the alkylation of secondary amines the term alkylation being used here to denote the introduction of R1 groups in general . The compounds of the formula I can be converted in conventional manner into acid addition or base salts and vice versa. An example of a suitable acid is hydrochloric acid and suitable bases include alkaline or alkaline earthmetalhydroxides or ammonium hydroxide. The starting materials other than those of formulaII are either known or can be prepared analogously to known methods e.g. according to the following scheme R1 to R5 being as defined above .EMI4.1 These processes are carried out in conventional manner, the cyclisation of the compounds of formula IV being analogous to that of compounds of formula IVa. It will be appreciated that the compounds IIIa andIIIb are equivalent tautomeric forms the balance of which will depend on the nature of the substituents, and the reaction conditions employed. The compounds of formulaII are new and also belong to the invention. The compounds of formula I are useful as pharmaceuticals in particular anti microbial agents, as indicated by their inhibiting effect against various bacteria, e.g. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus faecalis, Escheria coli, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus morganii, Shigella spp., Enterobacter spp., Haemophilus spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serrata marcescen, Salmonella spp. andNeisseria gonorrhoae, in vitro in the series dilution test at concentrations of, for example 0.01 to 50 Fg ml, and in vivo in the mouse at dosages of, for example, about 2 to 27 mg kg of animal body weight. The compounds are therefore useful as antibacterially active antibiotics for example in treating infections of the urinary tract. For this use, an indicated suitable daily dosage is from about 1 to 3 g, suitably administered in divided doses of from 250 to 1500 mg, two to four times daily, or in retard form. The compounds may be employed in free form or in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts, which salt forms have the same order of activity as the free compounds. Suitable salt forms include alkali and alkaline earthmetal and ammonium salt forms and hydrochloride salt forms. The compounds may be admixed with conventional pharmaceutically acceptable diluents and carriers, and administered in such forms as tablets or capsules. Such compositions also form part of the invention.The invention therefore also concerns a method of treating diseases or infections caused by bacteria using a compound of formula I and also compounds of formula I for use as pharmaceuticals e.g. as antibiotics and for use in the treatment of the human or animal body by therapy. The following example illustrates the invention whereby all temperatures are in degrees centigrade. Example 7 Ethyl 710 dihydro 10 oxo 217 phenanthroline 9 carboxylic acid A solution of 2,5 g 7 ethyl 7,10 dihydro 10 oxo 2,7phenanthroline 9 carboxylic acid ethyl ester in 30 ml 10 potassium hydroxide is refluxed for 21 2 hours with stirring. The reaction mixture is adjusted to pH 6 with 2 N hydrochloric acid and stirred for 30 minutes at room temperature. The resulting crystals are filtered under suction and washed consecutively with ice water, acetone and ether and then dried. Colourless crystals of m.p. 286 2880 are obtained. The structure is confirmed by analysis and IR, NMR, and mass spectroscopy. The compound of formula II required as starting material can be obtained as follows 7 Ethyl 7,10 dihydro 10 oxo 2,7 phenanthroline 9 carboxy lic acid ethyl ester a Isoquinol 7 yl aminomethylene malonic acid diethyl esterA mixture of 50.4 g 7 aminoisoquinoline and 79.5 g ethoxymethylene malonic acid diethyl ester is stirred under argon for 3 hours at 130 .

Further product can be obtained from the mother liquor by recrystallization from ethanol petrolether. b lO Hydroxy 2 , 7p hennthroline 9carboxvlic acid ethyl esterA mixture of 6,3 g isoquipol 7 yl aminomethylene malonic acid diethyl ester and 320 ml diphenylether are placed in a 2700 hot metal or oil bath. After commencement of the reaction liberation of ethanol the reaction mixture is allowed to stand for a further 20 minutes at 2700 bath temperature with occasional stirring.The mixture is cooled under argon, mixed with petrol ether, the resulting suspension filtered under suction and the residue slurried in dichloromethane. This mixture is again filtered under suction and washed with ample dichloromethane. After recrystallization from boiling dimethylformamide and careful drying in vacuo the product light grey crystals melts at 27I 2730. c 7 Ethyl 7 , lO dihydro lO oxo 2 ,7 phenanthroline 9 carboxylic acid ethyl ester 2.9 g Sodium hydride suspension 50 in oil are washed three times with petrol ether and added to 300 ml dimethylformamide. 14.8 g l0 hydroxy 2,7 phenanthroline 9 carboxylic acid ethyl ester are added at room temperature over 5 minutes with stirring and under argon.The mixture is then warmed to 800 and stirred for 30 minutes at this temperature. The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature and a solution of 8.58 g ethyl iodide in 100 ml dimethylformamide added dropwise over 15 minutes. Stirring is then continued for 18 hours at room temperature and 2 hours at 800. The reaction mixture is evaporated to dryness, the residue taken up in ice water and extracted 4 times with dichloromethane.The combined dichloromethane extracts are washed with a saturated sodium chloride solution, dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and evaporated to dryness leaving a red oil which after crystallization from ethanoljether produces crystals which melt at 184 1850. Further recrystallization from ethanol ether produces beige crystals m.p. 189 1900, d 7 Ethyl 7,10 dihydro 10 oxo 2,7 phenanthroline g carboxylic acid ethyl ester 7.4 g lO hydroxy 2,7 phenanthroline 9 carboxylic acid ethyl ester and 3.8 g pulverized anhydrous potassium carbonate are suspended in 150 ml dimethylformamide stirred for 1 hour at room temperature and then warmed to 60 700. A solution of 5.1 g ethyl bromide in 30 ml dimethylformamide is added dropwise at this temperature over 4 hours to the reaction mixture with stirring.
