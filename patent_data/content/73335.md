# Method and apparatus for combined cement bond and acoustic well logging.

## Abstract
Method and apparatus are provided for measuring acoustic signals having amplitudes of widely varying mag nitude during one traversal of the borehole corresponding to indications of cement bonding along a casing, as well as acoustic travel time through an increment of the formation. Variable attentuators are provided associated with acoustic receivers disposed within the logging sonde wherein at tenuation may be automatically adjusted as a function of acoustic transmitter receiver trigger pulses transmitted downhole, depending upon whether a cement bond or other log of acoustic signal information having a substantially different magnitude is desired.
