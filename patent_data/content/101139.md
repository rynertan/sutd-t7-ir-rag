# PRESSURE RESISTANT PAPER VESSEL

## Abstract
A pressure resistant paper vessel having highly im proved gas barrier property is provided. The paper vessel has at least one layer having a gas barrier film paper gas barrier film laminate structure formed by laminating both the surfaces of paper with a gas barrier plastic film having a carbon dioxide gas permeability of not more than 200. The pressure resistance of the paper vessel at normal tempera ture is higher than atmospheric pressure but not higher than 10 kg cmÂ²G.
