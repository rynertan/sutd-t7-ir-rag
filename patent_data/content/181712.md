# Reversible underground piercing device.

## Abstract
A reversible pneumatic underground piercing tool of the type having a reciprocating striker 18 with the impact of the striker on the front 19 or the rear 21 of the tool being controlled by the longitudinal position of a valve element 31 in the tool. An interengaging pin 42 and slot 43 arrangement in the tool defines the longitudinal position of the valve element 31 which is positively maintained in the selected position by the supplied air pressure. The longitu dinal position of the valve element 31 may be changed for reversing the direction of movement of the tool by interrupt ing the compressed air supply and rotating the air supply hose 27 a small amount in one direction or the other to reposition the pin 42 in the slot 43 .
