# Latch operating means.

## Abstract
Latch operating means, preferably for a door, are provided in which linear movement of an operating member towards or away from the door causes rotational movement of a latch operating member by interaction of a thread on one member with a thread engaging cam on the other member, in which locking means are provided to restrain rotation of the latch operating member either directly, or indirectly by restraining linear movement of the operating member.
