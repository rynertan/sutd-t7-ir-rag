## Description
Description SEMICONDUCTOR POWER DEVICE PACKAGE FOR SURFACE MOUNTINGThis invention relates to semiconductor packaging in general, and more particularly to a miniature package for semiconductor power devices suitable for fully automated manufacturing and testing before mounting in the next higher level of packaging.Representative of the closest known prior art is U.S. Patent 4,038,744 to Cheype et al, filed April 27, 1976 and entitled Methods of Manufacturing Carrier Supports for IntegratedChips and Mounting of Integrated Circuit Chips to aSubstrate U.S. Patent 4,283,839 to Gursky, filed July 7, 1980 division of U.S. Patent 4,234,666 filed July 26, 1978 , and entitled Method of Bonding Semiconductor Devices toCarrier Tapes and U.S. Patent 4,356,374 to Noyori et al, filed July 10, 1980, division of U.S. Patent 4,246,595 filedFebruary 28, 1979 , and entitled Electronics Circuit Device and Method of Making Same . Additionally, U.S. Patent 3,855,693 to Umbaugh, filed April 18, 1973, and entitled Method for Assembling Microelectronic Apparatus was considered relative to this invention and found to be of less pertinence than the previously cited art.In early power semiconductor packages, silicon or germanium power devices were mounted either directly to a header or to a thermal expansion matcher which separated the semiconductor power device from the outside of the case of the package.When the semiconductor device was mounted directly to the header, it was known that the thermal expansion rates were different between the semiconductor device and the header.Thus, thermal expansion matching devices were used in an attempt to provide an interface between the different expansion rates of the semiconductor devices and the headers, although, because of their expense and added complexity to the manufacturing process, the thermal expansion matching devices were generally used only with larger, or relatively high power, semiconductor packages. Representative of a smaller package of this variety was the industry standard TO 5 package, and representative of a larger of this variety of packages was the industry standard TO 3 package.in packages such as the TO 5 and TO 3 for transistors, the collector of the transistor was typically bonded directly to the metal case or to the thermal expansion matcher separating it from the metal case by means of a solder or eutectic bond.The emitter and base leads were typically wire bonded to conductive pins or leads mounted in the package. These packages were then hermetically sealed and the sealing compound typically provided support for the emitter and base leads. Although these packages were relatively expensive, the package cost was a relatively minor fraction of the cost of the semiconductor device itself.As semiconductor device manufacturing costs have dropped significantly, especially in the past two decades, the cost of the semiconductor device itself now silicon in almost all instances has become a much lower portion of the total cost of a TO 3 packaged semiconductor. Accordingly, for lower cost packages, industry has moved to plastic encapsulated packages.Plastic encapsulated packages have dramatically lowered the prices of semiconductor devices of all types, including power semiconductor packages however, reliability has been a problem in the relatively higher power semiconductor device plastic packages. Plastic encapsulated packages have been fairly reliable for low power semiconductor devices because the absolute temperature rise during operation is not high.To provide enhanced thermal performance in power devices packaged with plastic encapsulation techniques, a metal heat spreader is usually employed. The semiconductor device is mounted to the heat spreader and plastic encapsulation encloses the portion of the heat spreader on which the semiconductor device is mounted but leaves a portion of the heat spreader exposed for attachment to a heat sink. As in the metal semiconductor packages and using a transistor for this example , wire bonding is typically used between the semiconductor device and the emitter and base leads before this portion of the package is totally encapsulated with a plastic resin. Thus, the wire bonded leads become embedded in the plastic upon encapsulation.However, the plastic encapsulation material, the heat spreader, and the silicon expand and contract at different rates during the temperature cycles of normal operation of the device. This causes stresses on the wire bonded leads, and frequently, ultimate failure of these leads or bonds at the ends thereof.Accordingly, while these plastic encapsulated devices have greatly lowered the cost of completed packaged, power semiconductors, reliability problems are, nevertheless, present. Additionally, the plastic encapsulated packaging techniques described immediately above are not the most cost effective, high volume manufacturing techniques because these approaches do not provide for testing the semiconductor device after mounting to the heat spreader until the plastic encapsulation process is complete. Device failures often occur due to the temperature rise which is encountered during mounting to the heat spreader. Additionally, the completed power package is not automatically mountable to a printed circuit board, or other next higher level of packaging.Tape automatic bonding TAB techniques are gaining wide acceptance as a semiconductor packaging technique because of the ability to automate this production process to provide high volume packaging. Three examples of this technique are shown in the aforementioned U.S. Patents 4,038,744, 4,283,839, and 4,356,374. U.S. Patent 4,038,744 shows a technique for mounting a semiconductor chip on a polyimide film on which wiring patterns are formed before mounting by metallizing the film and etching away selected areas to leave the remaining areas in the desired wiring pattern. U.S. Patent 4,283,839 shows a TAB mounting technique in which the tape is simply the conductor, itself, with no substrate such as pol i Y S.Patent 4,356,374 refers to a TAB technique in which beam leads are mounted between a semiconductor device and a substrate, which beam leads themselves are formed on a polyimide tape.While these techniques lend themselves to high volume Ranufacture, they have not, in the prior art, lent themselves to the packaging of power devices because the prior art heat sinking techniques have not been compatible with the highly automated TAB packaging technology.In summary, therefore, it would be highly desirable to provide an inexpensive package for high power semiconductor devices, which package is capable of highly automated, high volume production, and testing during manufacture, to provide a very reliable packaged semiconductor power device.Accordingly, a miniature package is provided for power semiconductor devices which package is adaptable to tape automatic bonding TAB techniques. An elongated strip or tape of a film such as polyimide forms the substrate for a plurality of packages. A repeating metalization pattern is formed on the polyimide film. A thermal expansion matching material is repetitively mounted to a particular area on each of the repeating metalized patterns. At least one semiconductor power device is then mounted to each thermal expansion matcher and, in the preferred embodiment, beam leads connect areas of the semiconductor device to other areas of the metalization on the repeating pattern. The beam leads can also be attached by a second TAB technique. The multiple semiconductor devices now mounted and connected to the tape can be conveyed, automatically, through a testing station to eliminate the remainder of the manufacturing process relative to those devices which fail the test. The devices or multiple device assemblies on the tape which pass the tests are then passivated using a small amount of low expansion plastic material which fully encloses only the semiconductor device and thermal expansion matcher. The tape containing this plurality of packages is retested and the individual packages are excised from the tape. Miniature power semiconductor packages containing the fully tested power devices are now ready for mounting on the next higher level packaging substrate.The foregoing and other objects, features, extensions, and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following more particular description of preferred embodiments of the invention, as illustrated in the accompanying drawings.Fig. 1 is a perspective view of a semiconductor power device package of this invention.Fig. 2 is a top view of the substrate film of the package of this invention before metalization.Fig. 3 is a top view of the substrate film of the package of this invention after metalization.Fig. 4 is an enlarged side elevation view of the power semiconductor package of this invention structurally, electrically, and thermally attached to a typical next higher level of packaging.Referring now to Fig. 1, a perspective view of the miniature semiconductor power device package of this invention is shown.In describing the structure and the automated manufacturing technique for the package shown in Fig. 1, it will be helpful to refer to Figs. 2 and 3 for a description of the underlying structure and manufacturing process.Referring to Fig. 2, an elongated, insulated substrate film 1 is shown which may typically, for example, be a polyimide tape. Consistent with well known tape automatic bonding TAB manufacturing techniques, the film 1 includes a plurality of sprocket holes 2 suitable for automated feeding by TAB manufacturing equipment. Additionally, film 1 is manufactured with a plurality of sets of excised holes r, ,u 5. Accordingly, while only one set of holes 3 , 4, and 5 are shown in Fig. 2, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the elongated tape comprising film 1 in Fig. 2 has a plurality qf excised holes 3, 4, and 5 in a repeating pattern along the tape identical to the example of this pattern shown in Fig. 2.Referring now to Fig. 3, a portion of film 1 is shown on which metalized patterns 6, 7 and 8 overlie the excised holes 3, 4, and 5, respectively. The metalized patterns may be formed of copper, for example, and may be formed on the polyimide film 1 by well known manufacturing techniques such as plating and etching. The bonding areas of the metalized patterns 6, 7 and 8 may advantageously have gold flashing deposited on at least portions of the exposed surfaces thereof to facilitate on the semiconductor device side at the tape the soldering or eutectid bonding of the thermal expansion matcher and beam leads to the metalized patterns and on the opposite side of the tape to facilitate soldering or other bonding techniques to the next higher packaging level.Referring back to Fig. 1, a portion of the film 1 is shown which includes the metalized patterns 6, 7, and 8. To metalized pattern 8 is attached a thermal expansion matching material. The thermal expansion matching material may be, for example, a clad of Copper Molybdenum Copper or Cop per invar Copper. Invar is a steel alloy which contains approximately 36 nickel.The thermal expansion matcher is attached to the metalized pattern 8 by soldering and is also solderable on the opposite side thereof. Semiconductor power device 10, typically a silicon device, is solder mounted to the surface of thermal expansion matcher 9 opposite the surface of matcher 9 mounted to the metalized pattern 8. Invar is a trademark of Texas Instruments Incorporated. Accordingly, the thermal expansion matcher 9 matches the thermal expansion of the silicon semiconductor power device 10 on one side and a substantially different thermal expansion rate of a heat sink material, such as aluminum, on the other side of the metalized pattern 8 and thermal expansion matcher 9, as will be fully understood with reference to Fig. 4, below. It will be understood to those skilled in the art that the dimensions of the clad thermal expansion matcher are determined by the expansion rates of the silicon power semiconductor device and the heat sinking material such as aluminum in the next higher level of packaging. The thermal expansion matcher must be thermally conductive to conduct heat from the silicon power device to the heat sinking material and must also be electrically conductive to carry the high current of the semiconductor power device.In Fig. 1, a pair of beam leads 11 and 12 are shown which electrically connect regions of the semiconductor power device 10 to the metalized patterns 6 and 7, respectively. For example, beam leads 11 and 12 in a transistor configuration may typically be base and emitter leads. In high current power devices, it will understood that the emitter and base leads may be of substantially different sizes with a substantially larger beam lead being provided for the emitter than for the base of the transistor.Those skilled in the art will understand that the construction described above for the miniature power semiconductor device package readily lends itself to complete automation. Upon manufacture of an elongated film with repeating metalized patterns as described in Figs. 2 and 3, attachment of the thermal expansion matcher 9, and semiconductive power device 10 can be accomplished with TAB techniques. Additionally, the metalization of the beam leads 11 and 12 can be formed on another tape substrate and these beam leads may also be mounted in this package utilizing a TAB technique. After attachment of the thermal expansion matcher 9, power semiconductor device 10, and beam leads 11 and 12 to the metalized areas 8, 6, and 7, respectively, the film 1 including the partially completed package may be indexed to an automatic testing station whereupon suitable test probes of a testing apparatus not shown are brought into electrical contact with a portion for example, the underside of the metalized patterns 6, 7, and 8 to test the characteristics of the partially packaged semiconductor device 10. Through suitable means well known in the TAB art, those partially completed packages which fail this test are flagged to have the remainder of the manufacturing process omitted.Those partially completed packages passing the test are then indexed to a station not shown at which a relatively small amount of low expansion plastic material is deposited to enclose at least the semiconductor power device. In some configurations, this plastic passivation might totally enclose only the semiconductor power device and not all of the thermal expansion matcher. The plastic passivation material, such as a polymeric encapsulant, is indicated by the reference numeral 13 in Fig. 1 and, for the purposes of illustration only inFig. 1, is shown as a transparent material, although those skilled in the art will understand that the passivation material 13 will most likely not be transparent. The polymeric passivation material may be a high purity epoxy with a silica filler. After the passivation material is deposited, the film 1 on which the almost completed package is affixed is again indexed to a testing station not shown for a final test of the almost completed miniature semiconductor power device package.Those packages passing this test are then excised from the elongated tape 1 and appear as the package shown in Fig. 1 without the sprocket holes 2 shown in Figs. 2 and 3.Accordingly, the miniature power semiconductor package shown in Fig. 1 has been fully tested and is ready for installation into the next higher level of packaging. Referring now to Fig. 4, an enlarged or magnified side elevation view of the miniature power semiconductor device package of this invention is shown mounted to a next higher packaging level. For ease of understanding, the reference numerals used in Fig. 1 are repeated in Fig. 4. Additionally, the passivation material 13 has been omitted from this figure, although it would be included in actual practice. Since this is an enlarged view, the layers of solder or other bonding material are also shown. Accordingly, a layer of solder 16 bonds the thermal expansion matcher 9 to the metalized portion 8, and a layer of solder 17 is used to bond the semiconductor power device 10 to the thermal expansion matcher 9.Similarly, a layer of solder 15 is used to attach one end of the beam lead 12 to the semiconductor device 10 and another layer of solder 18 is used to attach an opposite end of beam lead 12 to the metalized portion 7.Reference numerals 20 24 denote the next higher packaging level on which the miniature power semiconductor device package of this invention is mounted. Metallized circuit wiring patterns 20 and 24 are affixed by plating or other deposition techniques to a relatively thin insulating film 21.Wiring patterns 20 and 24 may be, for example, copper and film 21 may be, for example, polyimide. A layer of suitable adhesive 22 is used to attach film 21 to a suitable heat sinking material 23 such as aluminum. The miniature semiconductor power device package of this invention, accordingly, is mounted to wiring patterns 20 and 24, etc. by solder layers 30 and 31. It will, therefore, be clearly understood that the thermal expansion matcher 9 matches the uneven rates of expansion of the aluminum heat sink 23 and the silicon semiconductor power device 10 to prevent failure of the bonding media between the aluminum heat sinking material 23 and the silicon semiconductor power device 10.It will be understood by those skilled in the art that while a single power transistor package has been used for the purposes of describing this invention, the package in Fig. 1 might also be configured to accommodate a pair of power diodes for a power supply in which, for example, the cathodes of each diode might be soldered to the thermal expansion matcher 9 and the anodes of the diodes might be separately connected to metalized portions 6 and 7 by use beam leads 11 and 12 of equal size in this application . Other component or semiconductor device combinations, of course, are also possible with this packaging technology. While the invention has been shown and described with reference to particular embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the foregoing and other changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
