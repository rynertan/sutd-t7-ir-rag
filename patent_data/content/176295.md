# ELIMINATING UNWANTED MATERIAL FROM A GAS FLOW LINE ELIMINATING UNWANTED MATERIAL FROM A GAS FLOW LINE

## Abstract
An apparatus and method for eliminating unwanted materials, such as corrosive gases, from an effluent gas flow line includes a reactive trap wherein chemical reaction between the unwanted materials, a reactant gas and a reactive element takes place under induced plasma condi tions. A ballast gas may be added to adjust operating pressures and to aid in creating the plasma. The reactant gas and the reactive element are selected so that relative harmless by products are produced. The reactive element is preferably maintained at a temperature of approximately 400 C and the chemical by products are passed through a condensation element in the reactive trap which element is maintained at approximately 30 C. Preferably, the plasma is induced by a microwave transmitter in conjunction with a waveguide inserted into a reactive trap, and a control system automatically monitors and adjusts the temperature and pressure of the reaction as well as controls the ratio of effluent gas and ballast gas.
