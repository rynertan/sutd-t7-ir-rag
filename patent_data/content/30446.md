# Process for cracking hydrocarbons.

## Abstract
Combustion air, prior to being introduced into the crack ing furnace 5 in a hydrocarbon pyrolytic conversion and se paration system, is preheated by employing bottom pump around 24 , top pumparound 28 and or quench water 31 streams diverted from the primary fractionator 14 externally connected to the pyrolysis reactor 5 in order to optimize the thermal efficiency of the overall process.
