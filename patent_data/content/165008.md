# POINTING METHOD AND APPARATUS

## Abstract
Pointing is applied to brickwork by means of apparatus which includes a tube 22 from which mortar or other pointing material is displaced by a piston having sealing engagement with the internal surface of the tube. The tube terminates in a tapering nose portion 23 with a centrally aligned nozzle 23a shaped to form the mortar into a ribbon for application directly to the crevices in the brickwork.
