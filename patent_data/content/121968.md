## Abstract
A tractor cab suspension apparatus according to the in vention may be advantageously mounted upon a tractor having a chassis or frame 12 and a cab 14 mounted on the chassis end thereof. A suspension assembly is mounted between the chassis and cab at each of the left and right, front and rear corners of the cab. The subject hydraulic sus pension system includes a source of pressurized hydraulic fluid and a first conduit system extending between accumu lators and hydraulic cylinders of the suspension system. A control valve is mounted downstream of the source of pressurized fluid and is adapted to deliver fluid via a further hydraulic conduit system to the first conduit system for se lectively extending the suspension cylinders.
