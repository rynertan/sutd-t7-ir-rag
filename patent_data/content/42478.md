## Description
TITLE COMPOSITION AND METHOD FOR ADHESION OF RUBBER TO REINFORCING MATERIALS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION It has been conventional practice to prepare various textile reinforcing fibers, to be used in contact with rubber compositions, by pretreating them with a rubber latex and a phenol formaldehyde resin in which the phenol has almost always been resorcinol. This is the so called RFL Resorcinol Formaldehyde Latex method. Another method commonly used is to generate the resin in situ in the vulcanized rubber textile matrix by incorporating therein a formaldehyde or methylene donor compound, for example, hexamethylenetetramine or hexamethoxymethylmelamine, and a formaldehyde or methylene acceptor compound, for example, resorcinol.This method has been particularly effective where the reinforcing material is brass coated steel wire, since pretreatment of the wire by the aforementioned RFL method has proven to be largely ineffective. The methylene donoracceptor method is described by Endter, U.S. Patent 3,517,722. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It has now been found that excellent adhesion of rubber to reinforcing materials, such as textile fibers or brass coated steel wire, is achieved by the incorporation into the rubber composition, before vulcanization thereof in the presence of reinforcing materials, of a compound selected from those of Formula I, II or III, below. Such materials have not been used heretofore in the adhesion of textile fibers or steel wire to rubber. It is quite surprising that excellent adhesion, usually equal to or better than that which is attained by existing compositions, is achieved by the use of the compounds alone, since it would appear to deviate from the commonly accepted methylene donor acceptor theory of adhesion to do so. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The novel vulcanizable compositions ofthe instant invention consist essentially of A natural or synthetic rubber or a mixture thereof, CB a vulcanizing agent and C a compound represented by Formula I, II or III, more fully defined immediately hereinbelow. The compounds constituting component C of the novel compositions hereof have the following structural formulae EMI2.1 In the above formulae, R and R are, individually, lower C1 C4 alkyl, aryl C6 C10 or cycloalkyl wherein the R2 and R3 ring contains 5 or 6 carbon atoms R and R are, individual ly, alkyl tCl C8 , aryl, C6 C10 , cycloalkyl wherein the ring contains S or 6 carbon atoms, cyano, carboxy, carbalkoxy, or amido or dialkylamido substituted lower C1 C4 alkyl or hydroxy substituted lower C2 C4 alkyl R4 and R5 are, individually hydrogen, lower C1 C4 alkyl, or cycloalkyl wherein the ring contains 5 or 6 carbon atoms n is an integer from 1 4 inclusive, and x is 1 to 2. The compounds represented by Formulae I, II III, are readily prepared by the reaction of urea, or a substituted urea, glyoxal, formaldehyde, and an alcohol. Compounds ofFormula I are obtained by reaction of about one molar proportion of urea, about one molar proportion of glyoxal, about 2 molar proportions of formaldehyde, and about 2 molar proportions of a lower alkanol, a phenol, or a cycloalkanol.Such compounds include 1,3 dimethoxymethyl 4,5 dihydroxyimidazolidinone 1,3 diethoxymethyl 4,5 dihydroxyimidazolidinone 1,3 dibutoxymethyl 4,4 dihydroxyimidazolidinone 1,3 diphenoxymethyl 4,5 dihydroxyimidazolidinone 1,3 dicyclohexyloxymethyl 4,5 dihydroxyimid azolidinone, and the like. Compounds of Formula II are prepared most readily by the reaction of about one molar proportion of a disubstituted urea compound with about one molar proportion of glyoxal.Such compounds include 1, 3 dimethyl 4 ,5 dihydroxyimidazolidinone 1, 3 diethyl 4 , 5 dihydroxyimidazolidinone 1, 3 dibutyl 4 , 5 dihydroxyimidazolidinone 1, 3 dioctyl 4 , 5 dihydroxyimidazolidinone 1 ,3 diphenyl 4 , 5 dihydroxyimidazolidinone 1,3 di ss naphthyl 4,5 dihydroxyimìdazolidinone 1,3 dicyclohexyl 4,5 dihydroxyimidazolidinone 1,3 di 2 hydroxyethyl 4,5 dihydroxyimidazoli dinone 1,3 di 2 cyanoethyl 4,5 dihydroxyimidazolidionone 1,3 di 2 carboxyethyl 4,5 dihydroxyimidazoli dinone 1,3 di 2 carbomethyoxyethyl 4,5 dihydroxyimida zolidinone 1,3 di cyanomethyl 4,5 dihydroxyimidazolidinone, 1,3 di hydroxypropyl 4,5 dihydroxyimidazolidinone 1,3 di cyanobutyl 4,5 dihydroxyimidazolidinone 1,3 di amidomethyl 4,5 dihydroxyimidazolidinone 1, 3 di.CN ,N dimethylamidoethy1 4, 5. dihydroxyimida zolidinone, and the like. Compounds of Formula III are prepared, depending on whether x is 1 or 2, as follows When x is 1, about one molar proportion of a methylenebis substituted urea is reacted with about two molar proportions of glyoxal. The methylenebis substituted urea has the formula IV.EMI4.1 This methylenebis substituted ured is then reacted with the glyoxal and the resultant hydroxyalkyl product can then optionally be etherified with an appropriate Cl C4 alkane or a cycloalkanol to produce the product wherein R4 and R5 are alkyl or cycloalkyl. When x is 2, about 2 molar proportions of a monosubstituted urea, about one molar proportion of urea, about 2 molar proportions of formaldehyde, and about 2 molar proportions of glyoxal are reacted. The monosubstituted urea has the formula EMI4.2 where R , R5, and n are as defined above. In all instances, R and R5 may be the same or different. Preferably, R4 andR5 are the same. Such compounds include, where x 1 1,1 methylenebis 3 2 hydroxyethyl 4,5 dihydroxyimidazolidinoneS 1,1 methylenebis 3 methoxyethyl 4,5 dihydroxy imidazolidinone 1 1,1 methylenebis 3 ethoxypropyl 4,5 dihydroxy imidazolidinonel 1,1 methylenebis 3 cyclohexyloxyethyl 4,5 dihydroxyimidazolidinone 1,l methylenebis 3 3 hydroxypropyl 4,5 di hydroxyimidazolidinone 1,l methylenebis 3 4 hydroxybutyl 4,5 dihydroxyimidazolidinone 1,l methylenebis 3 8 butoxymethyl 4,5 dihydroxyimidazolidinone and the like.Where x is 2 4,5 dihydroxy 1,3 bist4,5 dihydroxy 3 hydroxy ethyl 2 oxo l imidazolidinyl methyl 2 imida zolidinone 4,5 dihydroxy 1,3 bis 4,5 dihydroxy 3 hydroxy butyl 2 oxo l imidazolidinyl methyl 2 imida zolidinone 4,5 dihydroxy 1,3 bisf4,5 dihydroxy 3 methoxy methyl 2 oxo imidazolidinyl methyl 2 imidazolidinone 4,5 dihydroxy 1,3 bis 4,5 dihydroxy 3 methoxy propyl 2 oxo l imidazolidinyl methyl 2 imidazolidinone 4,5 dihydroxy 1,3 bist4,5 dihydroxy 3 butoxy ethyl 2 oxo l imidazolidinyl methyl 2 imida zolidinone 4,5 dihydroxy 1,3 bis 4,5 dihydroxy 3 methoxy butyl 2 oxo l imidazolidinyl methyl 2 imida zolidinone 4,5 dihydroxy 1,3 bis 4,5 dihydroxy 3 cycloheXyl oxyethyl 2 oxo l imidazolidinyl methyl 2 imidazolidinone, and the like. The novel process of the instant invention comprises embedding a textile fiber or metal reinforcing material in a vulcanizable composition consisting essentially of Ai natural rubber, synthetic rubber or a mixture thereof, 91 a vulcanizing agent and C a compound represented byFormula I, II or III, more fully defined hereinabove, and vulcanizing said composition. The vulcanizable compositions and method of the present invention may be used in bonding reinforcing fibers or wire to rubber used in the manufacture of tires, drive belts, conveyor belts, pressure hoses, and the like. The rubber used may be natural rubber synthetic diene rubbers , such as polybutadiene, polyisoprene ethylene propylene terpolymer rubber EPDM butadiene styrene rubber SBR butadiene acrylonitrile rubber NBR chloroprene rubber chlorosulfonated polyethylene and mixtures thereof. The reinforcing materials useful herein include textile materials, in the form of fibers or fabrics, commonly used to reinforce rubber compositions, which includes cotton, rayon, polyamides, polyesters, polyimides, and the like, and metallic materials, such as wires and cord threads of raw steel, brass coated steel, and the like. The invention is particularly useful with brass coated steel wire. The vulcanizable rubber composition to which the reinforcing materials are bonded during vulcanization contain, in addition to tie promoter compound, the vulcanizing agent and the rubber, other conventional compounding ingredients such as carbon black., antioxidants, sulfur, accelerators, zinc oxide, high surface area silica including mixtures thereof with carbon black , processing and softening oils, and the like. The promoter compounds of the composition of the invention, as represented by Formulae I, II and III, above, are incorporated into the vulcanizable rubber composition in an amount of from about 1 to 10 parts by weight per hundred parts by weight of rubber used. Preferably, the compounds are used in an amount of from about 2 to 4 parts by weight, same basis. For optimum adhesion of the reinforcing material to rubber, particularly using brass coated steel wire, it has been found desirable to incorporate into the rubber composition a high surface area silica. The reason for enhanced adhesion in the presence of high surface area silica is speculative, but may result from hydrogen bonding of hydroxyl groups of the silica with the components of the vulcanization system. The silica is used in an amount of from about 2 to 14 parts by weight per hundred parts of rubber, preferably about 8 to 12 parts by weight, same basis, although good adhesion is still obtained in the absence of silica. Adhesion is measured using ASTM D 2229 73 with 15 reinforcing members embedded in a 0.5g x 0.5 x 8 block of rubber. The force to pull the metal cord or textile fiber out of the rubber is recorded in pounds per linear inch pli of embedded length.
