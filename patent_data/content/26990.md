## Description
FUNGICIDAL DIOXOLANYL AND DIOXANYL METHAZOLIUM DERIVATIVES, COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING THEM, PROCESS FOR PREPARATION THEREOF, AND USES THEREDF This invention relates to fungicidal dioxolanyland dioxanyl methazolium derivatives, to compositions comprising them, to a process for the preparation thereof, and to uses thereof. The present invention provides fungicidal compounds of Formula IEMI1.1 whereinR1, R2, R3 represent independently of one another hydrogen or a halogen, at least one residue being a halogen A represents one af the following groups a , b , c and d EMI1.2 Z O or S R5 hydrogen or C1 C6 alkyl, possibly substituted with a halogen methyl z methyl or ethyl R7 methyl, ethyl, or propyl, or R and R7 together constitute a tetramethylene group that can be substituted by 1 or 2 methyl groups R8 C1 C6 alkyl, C3 C4 alkenyl, 2 propinyl , 3 halo 2 propinyl, C1 C6alkoxy C1 C6 alkyl, or phenyl or benzyl possibly substituted singly. doubly, or triply by a halogen, alkyl, alkoxy, nitro, cyano, or trifluoro methyl R9 and R10 represent independently of one another hydrogen or C1 C4 alkyl andR11 hydrogen, C1 C4 alkyl, or CH2 OH, the total number of C atoms in R9, R10 , and R11 not exceeding 10 X represents CH or N R4 represents C1 C16 alkylt possibly substituted singly or multiply by a halogen, CH, SCN, COO C1 C3 alkyl, phenyl, or naphthyl and or possibly interrupted byEMI2.1 or S02, C3 C6 alkenylmethyl possibly substituted by a halogen or an alkylthio group, or C3 C6 alkinylmethyl possibly substituted by a halogen, the phenyl or naphthyl group substituent possible in R4 being also possibly substituted singly or multiply by a halogen, NO1, CN, OH, C1 C4 alkyl, methcxy, tri fluoromethyl, ar phenyl, andY represents the anion of an organic or inorganic acid. In case A falls into one of the groups a , b or c , then the compounds in Formula I stand for quarternary dioxolane. In case A represents the group mentioned in d , then the compounds stand for auarternary dioxane. By alkyl or an alkyl part of another substituent are meant, according to the number of carbon atoms specified, for example the following groups methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl, dodecyl, hexadecyl, and their isomers such as isopropyl, isobutyl, sec.butyl, tert.butyl, 3 ethylpentyl, and 3 methylbutyl. The O or S atoms and the CO or S02 groups possibly present in residue R4 can occur in the alkyl residue itself, but also between the alkyl residue and a possible substituent. By alkenyl are meant for example allyl, 2 butenyl, and 3 methyl 2 butenyl, whereas alkinyl represents, inter alia, propargyl. The halogen stands for fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine. The anions are derived, for example, from hydrohalic acids, such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, or hydroiodic acid, fluoroboric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, thiophosphoric or dithiophosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, acetic acid, haloacetic acids, propionic acid, hnlopropionic acids, butyric acid, oxalic acid, picric acid, p toluenesulfonic acid, or benzensulfonic acid. The triazole compounds of Formula I X N are clearly preferred as fungicides. The compounds of Formula I can be prepared by reacting a compound of Formula IIEMI3.1 with a compound of Formula III Y R4 III where R1, R2, R3, R4, A, X, and Y have the same meanings as in Formula I. The reactions can be performed in the pre sence or absence of protic or aprotic solvents inert to the reactants.For example, the following can be used alcohols such as ethanol nitriles such as acetonitrile ethers such as dioxane, dimethoxyethane, or butyl methyl ether halohydrocarbons such as chloroform, trichlorethane, etc.The reactions are performed at normal pressure or at a slightly elevated pressure and at temperatures between 0 and 1800C and preferably between 50 and 1200C. This method also constitutes a part of the invention. In a further variant of the process, and if so desired, the anion Y in an already obtained compound of Formula I in accordance with basically known methods can be exchanged for another anion, for example by converting a quarternary azalium halide of Formula I into the corresponding azolium hydroxide with a base or an anion exchangerand reacting it with an acid cf. Houben Weyl 11 2, 620 . The starting compounds of Formula II are known in particular from U.S. Patents 3,575,999 3,936,470 4,101,666 4,106,664 4,156,008, Swiss Applications 7963 78 8001 78 8005 78 8041 78, and U.S. AppLication 53,640, and analogs can be prepared according to the methods described therein. The compounds of Formula I have a better action when compared with these starting substancos already familiar as fungicides. Thus, undesirable plant regulatory excess effects and the phytotoxicity sometimes caused by the compounds of Formula It can be largely eliminated. The Formula I compounds can be used on their own or together with suitable carriers and or admixtures that cat be solid or liquid and correspond. to the substances usual in formulation techniques such as natural or regenerated minerals, solvents, dispersants, wetting agents., adhesion agents, thickeners, binding agents, or fertilizers.Substances of this kind are manufactured in a basically kno wn manner by intimate mixing and grinding of the components The Formula I compounds are found in the following practical forms the data on the weight percentages representing ad vantageous quantities of the active p rinciple . Solid forms dusting or spraying materials, up to 10 a granulates, coated granulates, impregnation granulates and homogeneous granulates pellets grains 1 to 80R é Liquid forms . a dispersabic in water active principle concentrates wettable powders, pastes, 25 90, in the commercial pack, 0.01 to 15 in ready for use solution, emulsions solution concentrates 10 to 50 0 0.01 to 15 in ready for use solution b Solutions aerosols. The content of active ingredient in commercial products liesbetween 0.1 to 95 percent w w , the content of additives from 5 to 99.9 percent w w , whereby, in general, 0 to 30 percent w w tenside can be found included in the additives. By tensides should hereby be understood contact surface or surface active agents which are mostly dissolved or dispersed in a liquid and are adsorbed particularly on contact surfaces. A tenside molecule contains at least one group which shows affinity to substances of stronger polarity which in general causes the solubility in water and at least one other group with less affinity to water.Tensides are therefore molecules with one lipophil hydrophob, i.e. molecule part which lacks affinity to water or has an affinity to lipids, mostly one carboxyl part with alkyl and or aryl components and furthermore with one hydrophil lipophob, i.e. molecular part which has an affinity to water and lacks affinity to lipids, e.g.. a perfluoralkyl part. Generally, products used in practical work are mostly mixtures of such compounds. Tensides not only make possible a good distribution of the active substance in a liquid, e.g. aqueous medium, but also an increased wettability of the plants. This leads to a reduction of the active ingredient in the finished product and thereby to a smaller environmental burden. The Formula I compounds can, of course, in order to suit the conditions obtaining, be used with other suitable pesticides to broaden the action spectrum, e.g. with fungicides, bactericides, insecticides, acaricides, herbicides, or agents that influence plant growth. The discovery covers also substances which contain at least one active substance as a component in Formula I, as well as the application of the substance to the fight against and or prevention of an attack of microorganism. Furthermore, the present discovery also includes the manufacturing of the substance, which can be recognized through the thorough mixing of the active substance with one or several substances described herein, respectively function groups Included is also a procedure for the fight against microorganisms, which distinguishes itself through the application of the compounds of Formula I, resp. the new substance Surprisingly, it has been found that compounds with the structure of Formula I exhibit a microbicide spectrum for the protection of cultivated plants that is very beneficial for practical r equirements.The cultivated. plants within the scope of the present invention may be, for example Cereal crops wheat, barley, rye, oats, rice Beets sugar and fodder beets pip fruits, stone fruits, and. berry fruits apples, pears, plums, peaches, almonds, cherries, strawberries , raspberries, and blackberries legumes beans, lentils, peas., soya oil cultures rape,. mustard,poppyseed, olives, sunflowers, coconut trees, castor oil plants, cocoa tre es, peanuts cucumber plants pumpkins, cucumbers, melons fibrous plants cotton, flax, hemp,. jute. , citrus fruits oranges, lemons, grapefruits, tangerines types of vegetables spinach, head lettuces, asparagus, types of cabbage, carrots, onions, tomatoes, potatoes, red peppers or plants such as maize, tobacco, nuts, coffee, sugar cane, grapevines, hops, banana, natural rubber, and ornamental plants. The use of the active principles of Formula I on plants or parts fruit, blossoms, foliage, stems, tubers, roots of these and related useful cultures can check or destroy the occurrence of fungi, parts of the plant growing subsequently also being protected from such fungi. The active principles are effective against the phytopathogenic fungi of the following classes ascomycetes e.g. Erysiphaceae, Podosphaera, Venturia basidomycetes, in particular rust fungi e.g. Puccinia fungi imperfecti e.g. Botrytis and oniliales inter alia Cercospora , and the Omycetes of the class of Phycomycetes. In addition, the Formula I compounds sometimes have a systemic action.They can also be used as disinfectants for the treatment of seed fruit, tubers, grains and plant cuttings for protection against fungal infections and against phytopathogenic fungi occurring in the soil. The invention thus also comprises the use of the Formula I compounds to combat phytopathogenic microorganisms. The following substituents and combinations of these are preferred with R1, R2, R3 2,4 dichloro the phenyl group is formed to the rest of the molecule in the 1 position with a R5 hydrogen or C1 C4 alkyl b R6 and R7 methyl or together tetramethylene c Z O, R8 C1 CT alkyl or phenyl with R4EMI7.1 EMI7.2 possibly substituted or CH2CH ii CH2 CH CH2, EMI7.3 alkyl,EMI7.4 possibly substituted by C1, NO2, CN, OH, CH3, OCH3, CF3 with X N with Y a halide, sulfate, nitrate, phosphate, methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, p toluenesulfonate, or benzenesulfonate anion. Thus, it is found that the following groups are preferred R1 R 2 chlorine R3 hydrogenEMI8.1 where R5 is hydrogen or C1 C4 alkylR8 is C1 C3 alkyl or phenyl R9 and R10 are independently of one another hydrogen or C1 C4 alkyl, andR11 is hydrogen, C1 C4 alkyl, or CH20H, the total number of carbon atoms in R9, R10, and R11 not e xceeding ten,X r epresents N ,R4 is C3 C6 alkenylmethyl, C3 C6alkinylmethyl,EMI8.2 alkyl,EMI8.3 possibly substituted by Cl, N02, CN, OH, CH3r OCH3 , or CH2CN andY represents a halide, sulfate, nitrate, phosphate, methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, p toluenesulfonate, or benzenesulfonate anion Furthermore, the compounds of the following subgroupIb are favoured R1 hydrogen or chlorine chlorineR3 hydrogen EMI9.1 wherein R5 means ethyl or n propyl, R8 represents C1 C3 alkyl or phenyl, Rg means hydrogen or methyl, and R10 means hydrogen or C1 C3 alkyl,X N CH2 CO R12 or CH COOR13 , wherein R12 is C1 C4 alkyl or one unsubstituted phenylradical or one phenyl radical substituted by alkyl, halogen,NO2, CN, OH, OCH3, CF3 singly or multiple wherein R12 further means CH2 CO 13 CH2 COOR13 or OR14 R13 stands for C1 C4 alkyl and R14 means alkyl, alkenyl or alkinyl each with maximum of 6 C atoms or an unsubstituted phenyl radical or a substituted one by C1 C4 alkyl and or halogen. In the structure element R4 CH2 CO R12 either the hydrogen can be substituted by lower alkyl or the CO group can be substituted by S02. In principle such groups R4 will behave comparably to the groups R4 in the subgroup Ib. The activity progression of a compound of Formula I in relation to a compound of Formula II cannot be derived from the molecular structure, because compounds R4V ofFormula III do not contain this fungicide activity. One equimolar mixture of a compound of Formula II and one compound of Formula III exhibits, as expected, a weaker fungicide activity than a compound of Formula II by itself. It is therefore surprising that the quarternarization of compounds of Formula II with fungicidally inactive compounds leads R4Y to fungicides with favourable activity spectrum and decreasing phytotoxic side effects Favoured active substances are, e.g. the below listed compounds no. 1.9, 1.10, 1.15, 1.18,1.20, 1.47, 1.48, 1.49, 1.57,. 1.80, 1.81, 1.84, 1.85 , 1.86,. 1.88,. 2.10, 2.11, 2.12, 4.7, 4.23. These preferred groups are obviously part of the invention as well. The following Examples serve the purpose of explaining the invention without limiting its scope. The data on temperature are in degrees centigrade, the data on pressure in millibars, and the data on parts and percentages refer to weight. Preparation ExampleExample 1 Process for the manufacture of the quaternary salt of 1 2 2,4 dichlorophenyl 4 n propyl 1 ,3 dioxolan 2 ylmethyl 1H 1 ,2,4 triazole of formulaEMI11.1 19 g of the compound 1 2 2,4 dichlorophenyl 4 n propyl 1,3 dioxolan 2 yl methylj lH 1,2,4 triazole and 9 g of bromomethyl tert.butyl ketone were boiled in 700 ml of ethanol overnight under reflux. The mixture was then boiled down, the resin left behind was digested with ether, filtered under suction, and washed well with ether. The white precipitate melted at 156 1580C.
