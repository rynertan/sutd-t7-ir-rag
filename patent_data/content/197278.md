## Description
Ballistic resistant articles such as bulletproof vests, curtains, mats, raincoats and umbrellas containing high strength fibers are known. Fibers conventionally used include aramid fibers such as poly phenylenediamine terephthalamide , nylon fibers, glass fibers and the like. For many applications, such as vests or parts of vests, the fibers are used in a woven or knitted fabric. In The Application of High Modulus Fibers to Ballistic Protection , R. C. Laible, et al., J. Macromol. Sci. Chem. A7 l , pp. 295 322 1973, it is indicated on p. 298 that an important requirement is that the textile material have a high degree of heat resistance for example, a polyamide material with a melting point of 255 C appears to possess better impact properties ballistically than does a polyolefin fiber with equivalent tensile properties but a lower melting point. R. C. Laible Fibrous armor, It is, therefore, apparent that there is no generally applicable relationship between fabric areal density and ballistic resistance. US Patent 4,457,985 of Harpell et al., also mentioned at page 4, line 6 of the subject patent discloses articles such as vests, helmets and structural elements containing a network of ultrahigh molecular weight, high strength, high modulus polyethylene or polypropylene fibers. It is indicated at column 4, lines 2 and 3 thereof that the yarns may be of any denier . Notwithstanding such disclosure, no yarns used in the examples to manufacture bullet resistant articles were less than about 500 denier, and where fibers of less than this denier are disclosed, they are wound together to form a composite yarn. Thus there is no disclosure in this reference of yarns combining a denier of less than 250 and a tensile modulus of greater than 1,200 g denier and the overall teaching of this reference is to use denier values significantly above the upper limit of 250 as specified in claim 1 of the subject patent. The present invention provides an improved, flexible, ballistic resistant soft fabric anti ballistic article comprising at least one network comprising fiber or yarns selected from the group of extended chain polyethylene and extended chain polypropylene fibers, extended chain polyvinyl alcohol fiber and extended chain polyacrylontrile fiber whereby the fiber and the yarn have a denier of not more than 250 and a tensile modulus of at least 1200 g denier. In another embodiment the fiber or yarns are coated with a low modulus elastomeric material which has a tensile modulus of less than 6,000 psi 41,300 kPa . Compared to conventional ballistic resistant fabric structures, the fabric of the present invention can advantageously provide a selected level of ballistic protection while employing a reduced weight of protective material. Alternatively, the fabric of the present invention can provide increased ballistic protection when the article has a weight equal to the weight of a conventionally constructed piece of flexible fabric type, soft armor. For the purposes of the present invention, a fiber is an elongate body the length dimension of which is much greater than the transverse dimensions of width and thickness. Accordingly, the term fiber includes monofilament and multifilament fiber, ribbon, strip, and the like having regular or irregular cross section. A ballistic resistant fabric used in the present invention includes at least one network comprised of a high strength, ultra high molecular weight, extended chain polyolefin ECP fiber, extended chain polyvinyl alcohol PVA fiber, and extended chain polyacrylonitrile PAN fiber. The fiber may be arranged and configured to form a yarn, provided the yarn denier is not more than 250 and has a tensile modulus of at least 1200 g denier. This yarn can be employed to form the fabric. In addition, the fiber and yarn have a tensile modulus which preferably is at least 1800 g den. In another aspect of the invention, the fiber or yarn of the network is coated with a low modulus elastomeric material comprising an elastomer to provide improved ballistic resistance. This elastomeric material has a tensile modulus of less than 6,000 psi 41,300 kPa , measured at 23 C. Preferably, the tensile modulus of the elastomeric material is less than 5,000 psi 34,500 kPa , more preferably, is less than 1,000 psi 6900 kPa and most preferably is less than 500 psi 3,450 kPa to provide even more improved performance. The glass transition temperature Tg of the elastomer of the elastomeric material as evidenced by a sudden drop in the ductility and elasticity of the material is less than 0 C. Preferably, the Tg of the elastomer is less than 40 C, and more preferably is less than 50 C. The elastomer also has an elongation to break measured at 23 C of at least 50 . Preferably, the elongation to break is at least 100 , and more preferably, it is 300 for improved performance. USP 4,457,985 generally discusses the high strength, high molecular weight, extended chain polyolefin fibers, employed in the present invention. More particularly, suitable polyethylene fibers are those having a molecular weight of at least 500,000, preferably at least one million and more preferably between two million and five million. Such extended chain polyethylene ECPE fibers may be grown in solution such as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,137,394 to Meihuzen et al., or U.S. Patent No. 4,356,138 of Kavesh et al., issued October 26, 1982, or a fiber spun from a solution to form a gel structure, as described in German Off. 3,004,699 and GB 2051667, and especially as described in Application Serial No. 572,607 of Kavesh et al. filed January 20, 1984 see EPA 64,167, published Nov. 10, 1982 . Depending upon the formation technique, the draw ratio and temperatures, and other conditions, a variety of properties can be imparted to these fibers. The tenacity of the fibers should be at least 15 grams denier, preferably at least 20 grams denier, more preferably at least 25 grams denier and most preferably at least 30 grams denier. Similarly, the tensile modulus of the fibers, as measured by an Instron tensile testing machine, is at least 1200 grams denier and preferably at least 1,500 grams denier. These highest values for tensile modulus and tenacity are generally obtainable only by employing solution grown or gel fiber processes. Many of the fibers have melting points higher than the melting point of the polymer from which they were formed. Thus, for example, ultra high molecular weight polyethylenes of 500,000, one million and two million generally have melting points in the bulk of 138 C. The highly oriented polyethylene fibers made of these materials have melting points 7 13 C higher. Thus, a slight increase in melting point reflects the crystalline perfection of the fibers. Nevertheless, the melting points of these fibers remain substantially below nylon and the efficacy of these fibers for ballistic resistant articles is contrary to the various teachings cited above which indicate temperature resistance as a critical factor in selecting ballistic materials. Similarly, highly oriented, extended chain polypropylene ECPP fibers of molecular weight at least 750,000, preferably at least one million and more preferably at least two million may be used. Such ultra high molecular weight polypropylene may be formed into reasonably well oriented fibers by the techniques prescribed in the various references referred to above, and especially be the technique of U.S. Serial No. 572,607, filed January 20, 1984, of Kavesh et al. and commonly assigned. Since polypropylene is a much less crystalline material than polyethylene and contains pendant methyl groups, tenacity values achievable with polypropylene are generally substantially lower than the corresponding values for polyethylene. Accordingly, a suitable tenacity is at least 8 grams denier, with a preferred tenacity being at least 11 grams denier. The melting point of the polypropylene is generally raised several degrees by the orientation process, such that the polypropylene fiber preferably has a main melting point of at least 168 C, more preferably at least 170 C. The particularly preferred ranges for the above described parameters can advantageously provide improved performance in the final article. As used herein, the terms polyethylene and polypropylene mean predominantly linear polyethylene and polypropylene materials that may contain minor amounts of chain branching or comonomers not exceeding 5 modifying units per 100 main chain carbon atoms, and that may also contain admixed therewith not more than about 25 wt of one or more polymeric additives such as alkene l polymers in particular, low density polyethylene, polypropylene or polybutylene, copolymers containing mono olefins as primary monomers, oxidized polyolefins, graft polyolefin copolymers and polyoxymethylenes, or low molecular weight additives such as anti oxidants, lubricants, ultra violet screening agents, colorants and the like which are commonly incorporated therewith. In the case of polyvinyl alcohol PV OH , PV OH fiber of molecular weight of at least 500,000, preferably at least 750,000, more preferably between 1,000,000 and 4,000,000, and most preferably between 1,500,000 and 2,500,000 may be employed in the present invention. Particularly useful PV OH fiber should have a tenacity of at least 7 g denier preferably at least 10 g denier, more preferably at 14 g denier, and most preferably at least 17 g denier , and an energy to break of at least 22 joules g. PV OH fibers having a weight average molecular weight of at least 500,000, a a tenacity of at least 10 g denier, and an energy to break of 22 joules g are more useful in producing a ballistic resistant article. PV OH fiber having such properties can be produced, for example, by the process disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 569,818, filed January 11, 1984, to Kwon et al., and commonly assigned. In the case of polyacrylonitrile PAN , PAN fiber of molecular weight of at least 400,000, and preferably at least 1,000,000 may be employed. Particularly useful PAN fiber should have a tenacity of at least 10 g denier and an energy to break of at least 22 joule g. PAN fiber having a molecular weight of at least 400,000, a tenacity of at least 15 g denier and an energy to break of at least 22 joule g is most useful in producing ballistic resistant articles and such fibers are disclosed, for example, in U.S. 4,535,027. For improved ballistic resistance of the fabric article, the fiber has a tensile modulus which preferably is at least 1300 g den. Additionally, the ECP fiber has an energy to break which preferably is at least 22 J g, more preferably is at least 50 J g and most preferably is at least 55 J g. In the fabric of the invention, the fiber network can have various configurations. For example, a plurality of fibers can be grouped together to form a twisted or untwisted yarn. The fibers or yarn may be formed as a felt, knitted or woven plain, basket, satin and crow feet weaves, etc. into a network, or formed into a network by any of a variety of conventional techniques. For example, the fibers may be formed into woven or nonwoven cloth layers by conventional techniques. A preferred embodiment of the present invention includes multiple layers of elastomeric material coated fiber networks. The layers individually retain the high flexibility characteristic of textile fabrics and remain separate from each other. The multilayer article exhibits the flexibility of plied fabrics, and is readily distinguishable from the composite structures described in U.S. Patent 4,623,574 of Harpell, et al. and entitled Ballistic Resistant Composite Article . Vests and other articles of clothing comprised of multiple layers of fabric constructed in accordance with the present invention have good flexibility and comfort coupled with excellent ballistic protection. The flexibility of the ballistic resistant fabric structures of the present invention is demonstrated by the following test A 30 cm square fabric sample comprised of multiple fabric layers having a total areal density of 2 kg m², when clamped in a horizontal orientation along one side edge, will drape so that the opposite side edge is at least 21 cm below the level of the clamped side. The multiple layers of fabric may be stitched together to provide a desired level of ballistic protection for example, as against multiple ballistic impacts. However, stitching can reduce the flexibility of the fabric. Coated fibers may be arranged in the same fashion as uncoated fibers into woven, non woven or knitted fabrics. The fabric layers may be arranged in parallel arrays and or incorporated into multilayer fabric articles. Furthermore, the fibers, used either alone or with coatings, may be wound or connected in a conventional fashion. The proportion of coating in the fabric may vary from relatively small amounts e.g. 0.1 by weight of fibers to relatively large amounts e.g. 60 by weight of fibers , depending upon whether the coating material has any ballistic resistant properties of its own which is generally not the case and upon the rigidity, shape, heat resistance, wear resistance, flammability resistance and other properties desired for the fabric. In general, ballistic resistant fabrics of the present invention containing coated fibers should have a relatively minor proportion of coating e.g. 0.1 30 , by weight of fibers , since the ballistic resistant properties are almost entirely attributable to the fiber. Nevertheless, coated fabrics with higher coating contents may be employed. The coating may be applied to the fiber in a variety of ways. One method is to apply the neat resin of the coating material to the stretched high modulus fibers either as a liquid, a sticky solid or particles in suspension or as a fluidized bed. Alternatively, the coating may be applied as a solution or emulsion in a suitable solvent which does not adversely affect the properties of the fiber at the temperature of application. While any liquid capable of dissolving or dispersing the coating polymer may be used, preferred groups of solvents include water, paraffin oils, aromatic solvents or hydrocarbon solvents, with illustrative specific solvents including paraffin oil, xylene, toluene and octane. The techniques used to dissolve or disperse the coating polymers in the solvents will be those conventionally used for the coating of similar elastomeric materials on a variety of substrates. Other techniques for applying the coating to the fibers may be used, including coating of the high modulus precursor gel fiber before the high temperature stretching operation, either before or after removal of the solvent from the fiber. The fiber may then be stretched at elevated temperatures to produce the coated fibers. The gel fiber may be passed through a solution of the appropriate coating polymer solvent may be paraffin oil, aromatic or aliphatic solvent under conditions to attain the desired coating. Crystallization of the high molecular weight polyethylene in the gel fiber may or may not have taken place before the fiber passes into the cooling solution. Alternatively, the fiber may be extruded into a fluidized bed of the appropriate polymeric powder. If the fiber achieves its final properties only after a stretching operation or other manipulative process, e.g. solvent exchanging, drying or the like, it is contemplated that the coating may be applied to the precursor material. In this embodiment, the desired and preferred tenacity, modulus and other properties of the fiber should be judged by continuing the manipulative process on the fiber precursor in a manner corresponding to that employed on the coated fiber precursor. Thus, for example, if the coating is applied to the xerogel fiber described in U.S. Patent 4,551,296 of Kavesh et al., and the coated xerogel fiber is then stretched under defined temperature and stretch ratio conditions, the applicable fiber tenacity and fiber modulus values would be the measured values of an uncoated xerogel fiber which is similarly stretched. A preferred coating technique is to form a network layer and then dip the network into a bath of a solution containing the low modulus elastomeric coating material. Evaporation of the solvent produces an elastomeric material coated fabric. The dipping procedure may be repeated as required to place a desired amount of elastomeric coating on the fibers. A wide variety of elastomeric materials and formulations may be utilized in this invention. The essential requirement is that the elastomeric material have the appropriately low modulus. Representative examples of suitable elastomers of the elastomeric material have their structures, properties, formulations together with crosslinking procedures summarized in the Particularly useful elastomers are block copolymers of conjugated dienes and vinyl aromatic monomers. Butadiene and isoprene are preferred conjugated diene elastomers. Styrene, vinyl toluene and t butyl styrene are preferred conjugated aromatic monomers. Block copolymers incorporating polyisoprene may be hydrogenated to produce thermoplastic elastomers having saturated hydrocarbon elastomer segments. The polymers may be simple tri block copolymers of the type A B A multiblock copolymers of the type Most preferably, the elastomeric material consists of at least one of the above mentioned elastomers. The low modulus elastomeric material may also include fillers such as carbon black, silica, etc. and may be extended with oils and vulcanized by sulfur, peroxide, metal oxide, or radiation cure systems using methods well known to rubber technologists. Blends of different elastomeric materials may be used together or one or more elastomer materials may be blended with one or more thermoplastics. High density, low density, and linear low density polyethylene may be cross linked to obtain a matrix material of appropriate properties, either alone or as blends. In every instance, the modulus of the coating should not exceed 6000 psi 41,300 kPa , preferably is less than 5000 psi 34,500 kPa , more preferably is less than 100 psi 6900 kPa and most preferably is less than 500 psi 3450 kPa . A coated yarn can be produced by pulling a group of fibers through the solution of low modulus elastomeric material to substantially coat each of the individual fibers, and then evaporating the solvent to form the coated yarn. The yarn can then be employed to form coated fabric layers which in turn, can be used to form desired multilayer fabric structures. Multilayer fabric articles may be constructed and arranged in a variety of forms. It is convenient to characterize the geometries of such multilayer fabrics by the geometries of the fibers and then to indicate that substantially no matrix material, elastomeric or otherwise, occupies the region between fabric layers. One such suitable arrangement is a plurality of layers in which each layer is comprised of coated fabric fibers arranged in a sheet like array and successive layers of such fabrics are rotated with respect to the previous layer. An example of such multilayer fabric structures is a five layered structure in which the second, third, fourth and fifth layers are rotated 45 , 45 , 90 and 0 , with respect to the first layer, but not necessarily in that order. Other examples include multilayer fabrics with alternating fabric layers rotated 90 with respect to each other. In various forms of the fabric of the invention, the fiber network occupies different proportions of the total volume of the fabric layer. Preferably, however, the fiber network comprises at least 50 volume percent of the fabric layer, more preferably between 70 volume percent, and most preferably at least 90 volume percent. Similarly, the volume percent of low modulus elastomeric material in a fabric layer is preferably less than 15 Vol , more preferably is less than 10 Vol , and most preferably is less than 5 Vol . The specific weight of the fabric layer is expressed in terms of the areal density AD . This areal density corresponds to the weight per unit area of the fabric layer. Preferably, the fabric layer areal density is less than 0.3 kg m² more preferably the areal density is less than 0.2 kg m² and most preferably, the areal density is less than 0.1 kg m². It has been discovered that coated fabric comprised of strip or ribbon fiber with an aspect ratio, ratio of fiber width to thickness, of at least 5 can be even more effective than other forms of fiber or yarn when producing ballistic resistant articles. In particular embodiments of the invention, the aspect ratio of the strip is at least 50, preferably is at least 100 and more preferably is at least 150 for improved performance. Surprisingly, even though an ECPE strip material had significantly lower tensile properties than an ECPE yarn material of the same denier but generally circular cross section, the ballistic resistance of the coated fabric constructed from ECPE strip was significantly higher than the ballistic resistance of the coated fabric constructed from the ECPE yarn. Most screening studies of ballistic composites employ a .22 caliber, non deforming steel fragment of specified weight, 19 grains hardness and dimensions Mil Spec. MIL P 46593A ORD . Limited studies were made employing .22 caliber lead bullet weighing 40 grains. The protective power of a structure is normally expressed by citing the impacting velocity at which 5O of the projectiles are stopped, and is designated the V₅₀ value. Usually, a flexible fabric, soft armor is a multiple layer structure. The specific weight of the multilayer fabric article is similarly expressed in terms of the areal density AD . This areal density corresponds to the weight per unit area of the multiple layer structure. To compare structures having different V₅₀ values and different areal densities, the following examples state the ratios of a the kinetic energy Joules of the projectile at the V₅₀ velocity, to b the areal density of the fabric kg m² . This ratio is designated as the Specific Energy Absorption SEA . The following examples are presented to provide a more complete understanding of the invention. The specific techniques, conditions, materials, proportions and reported data set forth to illustrate the principles of the invention are exemplary and should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention. A low areal density 0.1354 kg m² plain weave fabric having 70 ends inch 28 ends cm in both the warp and fill direction was prepared from untwisted yarn sized with low molecular weight polyvinylalcohol on a Crompton and Knowles box loom. After weaving, the sizing was removed by washing in hot water 60 72 C . The yarn used for fabric preparation had 19 filaments, yarn denier of 203, modulus of 1304 g denier, tenacity of 28.4 g denier, elongation of 3.1 and energy to break of 47 J g. A multilayer fabric target F 1 was comprised of 13 layers of fabric and had a total areal density AD of 1.76 kg m². All yarn tensile properties were measured on an Instron tester using tire cord barrel clamps, gauge length of 10 inches 25.4 cm , and cross head speed of 10 inches minute 25.4 cm min . Fabric was woven in a manner similar to that used for preparation of fabric F 1, except that a higher denier yarn designated SY l having 118 filaments and approximately 1200 denier, 1250 g denier modulus, 30 g denier tenacity, and 60 J g energy to break was used to produce a plain weave fabric having areal density of approximately 0.3 kg m² and 28 ends inch 11 ends cm . Six layers of this fabric were assembled to prepare a ballistic target F 2. A 2 x 2 basket weave fabric was prepared from our standard yarn SY l having 34 ends inch 13.4 ends cm . The yarn had approximately 1 turn inch 0.39 turns cm and was woven without sizing. The fabric areal density was 0.434 kg m², and a target F 3 comprised of 12 fabric layers had an areal density of 5.21 kg m². This fabric was prepared in an identical manner to that of Example F 1 except that the yarn used had the following properties denier 270, 118 filaments, modulus 700 g denier, tenacity 20 g denier and energy to break 52 J g. The fabric had an areal density of 0.1722 kg m². A target F 4 was comprised of 11 layers of this fabric. Yarn SY l was used to prepare a high denier non crimped fabric in the following manner. Four yarns were combined to form single yarns of approximately 6000 denier and these yarns were used to form a non crimped fabric having 28 ends inch 11 ends cm in both the warp and fill direction. Yarn SY l, having yarn denier of 1200 was used to knit together a multilayer structure. Fabric areal density was 0.705 kg m². A ballistic target F 5 was comprised of seven layers of this fabric. Eight one foot square pieces of Kevlar 29 ballistic fabric, manufactured by Clark Schwebel, were assembled to produce a target F 6 having an areal density of 2.32 kg m². The fabric was designated Style 713 and was a plain weave fabric comprised of 31 ends per inch 12.2 ends cm of untwisted 1000 denier yarn in both the warp and fill direction. This sample was substantially identical to sample F 6, except that six layers of Kevlar 29 were used to produce a target F 7 having a total target areal density of 1.74 kg m². Fabric targets one foot square 30.5 cm and comprised of multiple layers of fabric were tested against .22 caliber fragments to obtain a V50 value. Fabric properties are shown in Table 1A and ballistic results are shown in Table 1B. Sample F 1 gave the best ballistic results, suggesting that a combination of high modulus yarns and fine weave fabric comprised of low denier yarn has particular merit. Sample targets were evaluated against .22 caliber lead bullets, and the striking and exit velocities of the bullets were individually recorded. Fabric properties are shown in Table 2A, and ballistic results are shown in Tables 2B and 2C. A comparison of the ballistic results of examples F 1 and F 4 indicates that higher modulus yarns are much superior for ballistic protection against .22 caliber bullets when woven into a fine weave fabric comprised of low denier yarn. These data also indicate that the F 1 fabric is superior to Kevlar ballistic fabric F 7 in current use, with respect to both the percent of bullets stopped and the average SEA. The individual fabric layers of the target described in Example F 1, after ballistic testing against both 22 caliber fragments and .22 caliber bullets, was soaked overnight in a toluene solution of Kraton D1107 50 g litre . Kraton D1107, a commercial product of the Shell Chemical Company, is a triblock copolymer of the polystyrene polyisoprene polystyrene having about 14 wt styrene, a tensile modulus of about 200 psi measured at 23 C and having a Tg of approximately 60 C. The fabric layers were removed from the solvent and hung in a fume hood to allow the solvent to evaporate. A target C 1, containing 6 wt elastomer, was reassembled with 13 fabric layers for additional ballistic testing. Six one foot square 30.5 cm fabric layers of the type described in comparative example F 2 were assembled together and designated sample C 2A. Six fabric layers identical to those of comparative example C 2A, were immersed in a toluene solution of Kraton G1650 35 g litre for three days and were hung in a fume hood to allow solvent evaporation. Kraton G1650, a triblock thermoplastic elastomer produced by Shell Chemical Co, has the structure polystrene polyethylenebutylene polystyrene and has about 29 wt styrene. Its tensile modulus is about 2000 psi 13.7 MPa measured at 23 C , and its Tg is approximately 60 C. The panel layers each had an areal density of 1.9 kg m² and contained 1 wt rubber. The layers were assembled together for ballistic testing and were designated sample C 2B. Each target in this series was comprised of six one foot square 30.5 cm layers of the same fabric, which had been prepared as described in comparative example F 2. The fiber areal density of these targets was 1.90 kg m². Sample C 4 was comprised of untreated fabric. Sample C 5 was comprised of fabric coated with 5.7 wt Kraton G1650. The fabric layers were soaked in a toluene solution of the Kraton 1650 65 g litre and then assembled after the solvent had been evaporated. Sample C 6 was prepared in a similar manner to sample C 5 except that after the sample had been dipped and dried, it was redipped to produce a target having 11.0 wt coating. Sample C 7 was prepared by sequentially dipping the fabric squares in three solutions of Kraton D1107 dichloromethane to produce a target having 10.8 wt coating. Fabric layers were dried between successive coatings. Concentrations of the Kraton D1107 thermoplastic, low modulus elastomers in the three coating solutions were 15 g L, 75 g L and 15 g L, in that order. Sample C 8 was prepared by dipping fabric layers into a colloidal silica solution, prepared by adding three volume parts of de ionized water to one volume part of Ludox AM, a product of DuPont Corporation which is an aqueous colloidal silica dispersion having 30 wt silica of average particle size 12 nm and surface area of 230 m² g. Sample C 9 was prepared from electron beam irradiated fabric irradiated under a nitrogen atmosphere to 1 Mrad using an Electracurtain apparatus manufactured by Energy Sciences Corporation. The fabric squares were dipped into a Ludox AM solution diluted with an equal volume of deionized water. Sample C10 was prepared in a similar manner to example C 9, except that the fabric was irradiated to 2 Mrads and was subsequently dipped into undiluted Ludox AM. This level of irradiation had no significant effect on yarn tensile poroperties. A plain weave ribbon fabric was prepared from polyethylene ribbon 0.64 cm in width, having modulus of 865 g denier and energy to break of 46 J g. Fabric panels layers one foot square 30.5 cm were soaked in dichloromethane solution of Kraton D1107 10g litre for 24 hours and then removed and dried. The 37 panels, having a total ribbon areal density of 1.99 kg m² and 6 wt rubber coating were assembled into a multilayer target sample C 11 for ballistic testing. As shown below, the damaged target C 1 stopped all .22 caliber bullets fired into it. These results were superior to those obtained for the same fabric before it was rubber coated and much superior to the Kevlar ballistic fabrics. See Example FB 2. Although this fabric was highly damaged, a .22 caliber fragment was fired into the target at an impacting velocity of 1381 ft sec 420 m sec and was stopped, corresponding to an SEA of 55.5 Jm² kg. This result indicates that the low modulus rubber coating also improves ballistic resistance against .22 caliber fragments. The V50 value for the uncoated fabric example F 1 was 1318 ft sec 401 m sec , corresponding to an SEA of 50.5 Jm² kg. The highest partial penetration velocity for Example F 1 was 1333 ft sec, 405 m sec corresponding to an SEA of 51.7 Jm² kg. Finally, this highly damaged sample was ballistically tested against .38 caliber bullets according to test procedure NILECJ STD 0101.01. Three .38 caliber bullets having impacting velocities of 780, 803 and 831 ft sec, respectively 237, 244 and 253 m sec were stopped by the target, and the bullet indentations into the clay backing were less than 1.2 inches 3 cms . The target sample easily met the specification. Even though this target had an areal density of only 1.76 kg m², it met or exceeded the U.S. Military specifications for Type 1 and Type 1A Kevlar 29 targets having a greater areal density of 2.24 kg m² Specification MIL C 44050 . This was accomplished in spite of the fact that the total number of ballistic impacts on this single target greatly exceeded requirements. It is, therefore, quite apparent that the fabric articles of the present invention can provide required levels of ballistic protection while employing a lighter weight of material. Targets C 2A and C 2B were marked with a felt pen to divide it into two, 6in x 12in 15.2 cm x 30.4 cm rectangles. The V50 values for each target was determined against .22 caliber fragments using only one of the rectangles one half of the target . Each target was immersed in water for ten minutes, and the hung for three minutes before determination of a V50 value using the undamaged rectangle. Data shown below clearly indicate that the small ammount of rubber coating has a beneficial effect on the ballistic performance of the fabric target when wet. Ballistic testing using .22 caliber fragments against six layer fabric targets having, fiber areal density of 1.90 kg m² showed that elastomeric coatings improved ballistic performance, but silica coatings were ineffective. Sample C 11 was tested ballistically and exhibited a V50 value of 1156 ft sec determined against .22 caliber fragments. This corresponded to a SEA value of 34.4 Jm² kg. This target exhibited good ballistic properties in spite of the fact that ribbon stress strain properties were inferior to those of most of the ECPE yarns used in this study. A V50 value of 1170 ft sec 356 m sec against .22 caliber bullets was obtained for sample C 11, whereas samples C 5, C 6 and C 7 allowed bullets having a striking velocity of approximately 1150 ft sec 350 m sec to pass through the target with a velocity loss of less than 250 ft sec 76 m sec . This indicates that the ribbon fabric is particularly effective against .22 caliber lead bullets.
