# Valve body having the form of a flange.

## Abstract
A flanged valve comprising a valve box 2 having a substantially axially extending channel 3 formed therein, said channel at one side being adapted to be connected to a supply line and at the other side to a discharge line, while a valve means that is positioned in the valve box can shut off the channel passage entirely or partially, and the valve box comprises means for mounting the valve box between the supply line and the discharge line, said means existing of passing through bores 4 through which mounting bolts can extend. In a preferred embodi ment the valve box substantially forms a cylindrical flange that can have such dimensions that the valve means and its operating mechanism are positioned entirely within the valve box.
