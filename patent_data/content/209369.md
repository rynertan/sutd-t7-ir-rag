## Description
This invention relates to recording visual images of, e.g., pathology samples. Most examination of tissue on the microscopic level is carried out by illuminating a thin tissue slice cut from the surface of a block, to give an effectively two dimensional image. Information about three dimensional structures in the tissue is obtained by examining and or photographing successive slices, which are commonly mounted on glass slides. The tissue is either stained prior to embedding in the block, or mounted slices stained on the slides. In general, the invention features image recording apparatus including means for holding a block in which an object is embedded means for cutting slices from the block to form successively deeper block faces and visual recording means positioned to record images of the successive block faces. In preferred embodiments, the visual recording means is a video camera which receives images through a microscope preferably a fluorescence microscope and which is connected to a computer capable of storing the images, and the apparatus includes a screen for displaying the stored images. Preferably the computer is also capable of creating on the screen a three dimensional reconstruction of a portion of the object from the stored images. Preferably the embedded object is a piece of human or animal tissue, and the embedding process includes the use of tissue staining dyes and or infiltrating and or embedding additives for providing sharper images, as is discussed in greater detail below. As used herein, the term staining refers to treating tissue with a dye which associates with the tissue on a molecular level. Infiltration refers to treating the tissue with increasing concentrations of a substance which permeates the tissue and then hardens. Embedding refers to immersing the infiltrated tissue in a substance which is usually the same as the infiltrating substance , which is then hardened to form the block the embedding substance thus serves to provide rigid support and to facilitate the cutting process. The invention provides rapid, highly automated recording and storage of structural information on the internal geometry of the embedded object, without the inconvenient, time consuming handling and storage of individual cut sections. These advantages flow from the fact that it is the image of the block face, rather than each cut section, which is recorded following each cut. Successive images can be recorded without moving the microscope the microscope and knife can be completely stationary throughout the process. The stored images readily lend themselves to computerized image processing, e.g., three dimensional image reconstruction, useful in many applications, particularly human and veterinary pathology analysis. Other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments thereof, and from the claims. The drawing will first be described. The Figure is a diagramatic representation of apparatus of the invention. Refering to the Figure, the general elements of the apparatus are the microtome components 1 8 in the Figure the microscope components 9 12 in the Figure the illumination system 16 18 in the Figure and the electronic components 13 15 in the Figure Turning first to the microtome components, there is shown conventional microtome including base 8, body 1, motor drive 2, reciprocating bar 3, tissue block holder 4, holding tissue block 5 in its lowermost position opposite metal or glass knife blade 6, held in knife holder 7. The microscope support arm 11 is attached to body 1 of the microtome, and to the microscope lens holder 10, which holds objective lens 9. The microscope is of the type manufactured, e.g., by American Optical Corp., in which focusing is achieved not by movement of the microscope specimen stage there is no stage in the illustrated apparatus , but by extension or retraction of the objective lens. Focusing is by means of control knob 12. Fluorescence epiillumination light source 16 powered by power supply 17 through connecting cable 18 is positioned to illuminate, through lens 9, the surface of block 5 when block 5 is at its uppermost position. Attached to light source 16 is video camera 13, connected via connecting cable 14 to computer 15. Before describing the operation of the illustrated apparatus, there will be described various methods of minimizing noise in the form of out of focus images of tissue which is deeper in the block than the surface image which is being recorded the less the deeper tissue is visible to the image recording means, the cleaner and more noise free will be the recorded surface image. One method of minimizing such noise, while providing tissue block contrast, is to stain the tissue with a flourescent dye, and then infiltrate the tissue with, and include in the embedding material generally a plastic polymer, as discussed in more detail below , a flourescence quencher e.g. ethyl iodide which inhibits emission by the dye the microscope in such a system is a fluorescence microscope which illuminates the block face at the absorbance wavelength of the flourescent dye, and views images at the emission wavelength generally in the visible range . The quencher inhibits excitation of the dye in the tissue deep in the block to a greater degree than the dye in the tissue at the surface, which has had some of the surrounding quencher removed by the microtome knife. Any suitable conventional fuorescence quenchers and dyes, e.g., fluorescein or Hoechst dye 33258 discussed further below can be used in the fluorescent dye quencher method. Another noise minimization method employs compounds which absorb ultraviolet light UV absorbers , in conjunction with a fluorescent dye which maximally absorbs at a wavelength near within 15 nm the absorption maximum of the UV absorber. For example, the method can employ a dye which maximally absorbs at about 340 nm and a UV absorber which also maximally absorbs at about 340 nm. This system works as follows. UV light of a wavelength of 340 nm illuminates the block face and is absorbed by and excites the fluorescent dye in the tissue at the block surface. Deeper in the block, the UV absorber absorbs the UV light to an extent which increases with increasing depth , inhibiting absorption and therefore emission by the dye deeper in the block. A suitable dye UV absorber pair is Hoechst dye 33258 Bisbenzimide,2 4 hydroxyphenyl 5 4 methyl 1 piperazinyl 2,5 bi 1H benzimidazole trihydrochloride pentahydrate , which maximally absorbs at 343 nm and the UV absorber 2 2 hydroxy 5 methylphenyl bensotriazole described in Another noise minimization method involves the inclusion in the infiltration and embedding material of a dye which, unlike the quencher which interferes with the mechanism of fluorescence emission, and the UV absorber, which blocks absorbance , blocks light transmittance in the visible range and this prevents emissions from deep in the block from reaching the surface. Black dyes are suitable for this purpose examples are the azine dyes, e.g., induline and nigrosines, described in An additional noise inhibiting method involves the use of two different fluorescent dyes, the first of which stains the tissue and emits at a wavelength which is absorbed by and excites the second, which is added to the infiltrating and embedding materials. Excitation of the first dye in tissue present at the surface of the block will simply cause the emission of light of the emission wavelengths to provide a recordable image. Excitation of the first dye in tissue deep in the block, however, results in some of the emitted light being asorbed by the second dye along the emitted light s path to the surface, reducing undesired emission from within the block. In addition, the excitation of the second dye causes light emission at a wavelength different from the emission wavelength of the first dye the computer associated with the microscope can be programmed to subtract from the image light of this second wavelength. Another method of reducing noise from images within the block involves enhancing the image using appropriate computer software. The ability of computer programs to enhance the surface image compared to deeper images is based on the differences in sharpness between surface and deeper images, resulting from light scattering which causes blurring within the block but not at the surface. Software for providing such processing exists and is used, e.g., for removing cloud cover from aerial photographs, as described in Lim, Image Enhancement in It may be desirable in some instances to employ several of the above described noise reduction methods in conjunction with each other, e.g., a UV absorber, a quencher, a visible light absorber, and computerized image enhancement can all be used in the same system. The first step in using the invention is the fixing, staining, and infiltrating embedding of the tissue. Such tissue processing is carried out using the materials described above, according to standard After staining and embedding, the tissue block 5 referring to the Figure is inserted into tissue block holder 4 in the desired orientation, and the microtome activated to cut tissue slices from the block with knife 6 while reciprocating bar 3 moves up and down and is advanced after each cut by the automatic microtome advancing mechanism which is standard on many microtomes, by a distance corresponding to the thickness of one section. The slices cut from the block can be discarded, or some or all retained for additional processing e.g., staining with any number of dyes for conventional examination. After each cut, flourescence excitation epiillumination light source 16 illuminates the surface of block 5 through lens 9, and video camera 13 records the fluorescent surface image also through lens 9, and transmits the image to computer 15 for storage and processing. The invention provides the capacity to automatically record and store large numbers of successive tissue images, with virtually no human handling of the tissue once the block has been mounted on the microtome. The storage of the images in a computer permits software controled manipulation of the images in a variety of ways. For example, the images of consecutive sections of the tissue will normally be stored, and the computer programmed, so that the person e.g. pathologist viewing the stored images can display them in rapid succession to effectively melt through the tissue on the display screen. In the case of a biopsy, this will result in the complete sampling of the tissue. In addition, the computer can be programmed to construct, from the stored images, a three dimensional reconstruction of all or a portion of the tissue, and to manipulate that image by rotating it to any desired orientation and or by choosing to view any cross section of the reconstructed image. The pathology applications of the invention are virtually limitless. Any tissue which was previously capable of being examined by conventional two dimensional microscopy can be analysed using the invention. Examples of problem pathology specimens that could be better examined, and entirely new approaches to tissue analysis possible with the invention, are In an image recording method according to the present invention which comprises staining the object using a first fluorescent dye characterised by a maximum absorbance wavelength and a maximum emission wavelength, it is preferred to infiltrate the object with, and embed it into, a material containing a quencher of the first fluorescent dye. It is also preferred to infiltrate the object with, and embed it in, a material containing a dye capable of blocking the transmission of visible light through the block.
