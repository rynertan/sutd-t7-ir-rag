## Description
METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR FABRICATING FLEXIBLE RECORDINGDISCS WITH I 2ROVED THERMAL AND HYGROSCOPIC STRESSCHARACTERISTICSBackground of the Invention This invention relates to methods and apparatus for fabricating flexible discs, particularly flexible recording discs having a magnetic coating composition on one or both surfaces. Flexible recording discs, known in the data processing field as floppy discs or diskettes , typically comprise a flexible substrate material provided with a magnetic coating composition on one or both surfaces. Such discs have enjoyed increasing use in the data processing industry for data storage and retrieval. In the past, such discs have been prepared by coating the substrate material in longitudinal web form with the magnetic recording composition, curing the recording composition layer and blanking the discs out from the sheet stock to form the normal annular shape. The thus formed disc is then typically inserted into an enclosure envelope, which is then sealed to prevent removal of the disc from the envelope but to permit rotation of the disc within the envelope by means of conventional floppy disc drives known to those skilled in the art. A major problem encountered in the use of flexible floppy discs lies in the anisotropic physical properties of the substrate materials employed. It is known that the magnetic recording track density attainable with a floppy disc is limited extensively by the dimensional stability characteristics of the thin substrate material, which is typically fabricated from a thin heat moisture sensitive polymer film. Stated differently, a narrow track written on a flexible disc at any given time may later change position and shape due to non uniform substrate expansion or contraction, so that reading of the stored information at a later time will be impaired or completely prevented.This problem is compounded by the fact that during rotation, the flexible disc substrate undergoes deformation due to a stress relaxation of built in stresses from the manufacturing process, b changes in temperature and humidity, and c centrifugal forces of rotation. No unexpectedly, flexible disc deformation is generally anisotropic. While attempts have been made to make the hygroscopic and thermal expansion characteristics of the flexible disc substrate material more uniform by pre annealing of the substrate, efforts to date to provide flexible discs with less unpredictable hygroscopic and thermal expansion characteristics, as well as extremely smooth surface flatness, have not met with substantial success. Summary of the Invention The invention comprises a method and an apparatus for treating a flexible disc provided with a coating composition to produce a finished article having improved thermal and hygroscopic stress and surface flatness properties. From a method standpoint, the invention broadly comprises the steps of providing an oversize disc blank having a magnetic coating composition on one or both surfaces of a flexible heat shrinkable substrate, securely clamping the substrate substantially uniformly along the periphery thereof, and permitting the blank to cure to a finished state while maintaining the blank securely clamped.The blank may be prepared by coating a continuous web of substrate material with a suitable magnetic recording composition, allowing the coating to dry, and cutting an annular disc from the coated web alternatively, the blank may be prepared by spin coating an annular substrate with a suitable magnetic recording composition, and allowing the recording layer to dry. The coating composition is cured by either permitting the composition to remain at room temperature or, preferably,by placing the coated substrate in a temperature controlled environment, such as an oven, for a predetermined period of time required to cure the coating composition and to stress relieve the substrate material by anisotropic shrinking. For magnetic coating compositions having polymeric ingredients, the minimum cure time period is that required to cross link the polymers in the coating composition. For flattening and stress relieving, however, the temperature should be above the glass transition point for the substrate material, typically about 720 C. The oven temperature may range anywhere from this point to the temperature at which the substrate material thermally degrades.Thus, the oven temperature may be in the range from about 720 C to about 6000 C, Curing is improved by providing ventilated clamping members and rotating the clamped discs about an axis perpendicular to the disc plane in order to expose the disc surfaces to uniform ambient temperature. After heat curing, the clamped discs are allowed to cool at room temperature so that the thermal stresses in the substrate material are stabilized prior to unclamping. From the apparatus standpoint, a first embodiment of the invention comprises a fixture assembly having a plurality of substantially identical clamping members, each clamping member having at least one flatted peripheral clamping surface adapted to engage one side of the peripheral surface of a disc in a substantially uniform member when the disc is arranged between a pair of clamping members, and means for providing a clamping force in a direction perpendicular to the clamping surfaces. For annular geometries, the clamping members are formed to a diameter substantially identical to that of the discs to be treated, and the ventilation apertures provided in the clamping members extend radially herethrough.Each flatted clamping surface is provided with a thin layer of a low friction material, such as a permanent TEFLON coating or a mold release agent, to permit the flexible substrate to creep during the curing process. The fixture assembly includes a laterally spaced pair of end members flanking the clamping members, with each end member having an inwardly facing thrust surface engaged with a juxtapositioned one of the clamping members, and a tension rod assembly is received through a bore in each one of the end members. The tension rod assembly includes a rod having a first end releasably engaged with one of the end members and a second end provided with a threaded portion and a tensioning member is coupled to the other one of the end members, with the tensioning member being threadably engaged with the threaded portion of the rod means.A thrust bearing element is preferably coupled between the tensioning member and the other end member. To aid in the assembly and disassembly of the fixture and the discs, a support stand is provided comprising a pair of laterally spaced end plates and means for coupling the end plates together. The means for coupling the end plates together includes means for providing a support and alignment surface for the individual clamping members and the discs during assembly and disassembly. The oven is preferably provided with a plurality of rotatable support wheels received within one of a pair of circumferential grooves formed in the fixture assembly in order to provide rotation to the assembled discs during the curing step. For cooling, a similar arrangement is included in the support stand. In both of the rotatable structures, thrust members are preferably included which provide an inwardly directed axial thrust to each end of the fixture assembly to prevent excessive end run out of the fixture assembly during rotation. In an alternate embodiment of the invention, individual clamping members having the flatted peripheral clamping surfaces are arranged on a moveable table having a loading station and an unloading station, and the table is arranged for movement through a curing station having one or more heat sources. The individual clamping members are coupled to automatically controlled member retracting devices to facilitate loading of pre cured discs and unloading of cured discs. The heat sources are prefereably radiation sources whose radiation is readily absorbed by the disc substrate and the coating composition, such as infra red heat lamps. The speed with which the discs are moved through the curing station is selected to ensure sufficient curing time at the temperature achieved in the curing station, while ensuring maximum throughput of untreated discs through the installation.One or more feedback sensors are provided at predetermined points within the curing station to enable the curing conditions to be monitored and, if necessary, modified by altering the curing station temperature, the speed of the table, or both. Preferably, each sensor is initially coated with a sample of the magnetic recording composition employed on the discs as a control. In this continuous flow embodiment, the majority of the heat is used to heat the discs and therefore this embodiment s more energy efficient than the batch processing first embodiment. Flexible recording discs fabricated in accordance with the invention exhibit highly stabilized thermal and hygroscopic stress properties, extremely smooth surface flatness and good durability. For a fuller understanding of the nature and advantages of the invention, reference should be had to the ensuing detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

Description of the Preferred Embodiments Turning now to the drawings, Fig. 1 illustrates the preferred method of fabricating flexible recording discs in accordance with the invention. As seen in Fig. 1, an oversize disc substrate is first spin or flow coated with a suitable magnetic recording composition on either one or both sides of the substrate alternatively, a disc is cut oversize from a previously coated web or sheet. After drying the coated composition by air drying, heat forced solvent flash off , or other suitable known techniques, the coated disc is clamped in a fixture of the type described below and heat cured for a predetermined time at a proper temperature.After curing, the disc is permitted to cool, and is subsequently removed from the fixture and subjected to further processing, such as edge trimm ngç insertion into a jacket and the like. The actual material employed for the fabrication process may vary in accordance with the requirements of any particular application. Suitable substrate materials include a wide variety of heat shrinkable substances, such as polyester based film e.g., polyethylene terephthalate, polypropylene, polyethylene, polyimide e.g., that sold under the trademark KAPTON , and the like. Other suitable substrate materials will occur to those skilled in the art.The substrate material normally ranges in a thickness from about one to about ten mils, the most common being approximately three mils thick. Many compositions are suitable for providing the magnetic recording layer. Examples of such compositions are the compositions disclosed in the U.S. patents numbers 3,419,420 3,775,178 3,437,510 3,808,079 3,574,684 4,048,375 3,650,828 4,049,871 3,657,539 4,058,646 3,681,137 4,074,012 3,689,317 4,075,384 3,761,311 4,122,234 The temperatures and time periods employed for the heat curing portion of the process in Fig. 1 depend upon a number of parameters and characteristics of the coating composition and the substrate material employed. Thus, for example, for a magnetic coating composition having polymeric ingredients, the minimum time period is dependent upon the minimum time required to cross link the polymers in the recording layer at the temperature selected.The minimum time period is also dependent upon the minimum length of time required to provide the requisite degree of stress relief and thermally induced shrinkage for the particular substrate material. The environmental temperature range employed with the curing step of the process is primarily dependent upon the speed with which the curing process is desired to be accomplished and also the temperature at which the substrate material begins to break down at the molecular level, i.e.the point at which the material undergoes decomposition or degradation of the physical properties. Temperatures in the range from about 720 C to about 6000 C are feasible for polyimide films which are capable of withstanding rather high temperatures . A useful range is from about 720 C to approximately 2500 C. The cooling cycle time has a minimum which is dependent upon the time required for the thermal stresses within the disc substrate to stabilize, preferably until the disc reaches room temperature. Typical values are from approximately 30 seconds to one hour. Fig. 2 is a front elevational view of a preferred embodiment of a portion of a fixture assembly 10 and assembly disassembly stand 12. As seen in this Fig., a support stand, generally designated by reference numeral 12 includes a pair of laterally spaced end plates 13, 14, interconnected by means of strut rods 15, two such rods 15 being visible in Fig. 2 and two being hidden. The rods 15 provide support for a plurality of clamping rings 16 and a pair of end bell members 17, 18. Each clamping ring 16 is provided with a plurality of radially directed ventilation apertures 20 which enable ambient air to freely circulate within the interior volume defined by the clamping rings 16 and the end bell members 17, 18. Clamping rings 16 are preferably fabricated from mild steel which is nickel plated to minimize corrosion. Each clamping ring 16 is provided with a pair of extremely flat vertical edge surfaces as viewed in Fig. 2 the clamping surfaces , preferably flatted to within a tolerance of .001 inch. This surface may be formed in any suitable way known to those skilled in the art, preferably by lapping, milling, chemical etching, or the like. The extremely flat clamping surfaces are provided for the purpose of ensuring substantially uniform clamping contact between adjacent clamping rings 16 and the interposed flexible discs 22 shown loosely disposed in Fig. 2. This intimate clamping engagement along the entire periphery on both sides of the flexible discs is essential to the fabrication of improved flexible discs according to the invention. The clamping force applied to the disc peripheries may range from about 35 to 200 p.s.i., with a value of about 72 p.s.i. preferred in the embodiment of Figs. 2 9. End bell members 17, 18 are substantially identical in construction and are generally cylindrical in shape, with a recessed groove 25 formed peripherally thereof adjacent the outer end, for a purpose to be described.End bell members 17, 18 are provided with ventilation apertures extending along the longitudinal axis of the assembly see Fig. 3 . Fig. 2 illustrates the first step in the fixture clamping process, namely, the arrangement of the individual clamping rings 16 in the support stand 12, the placement of the individual coated discs 22 in between adjacent clamping rings 16 and placement of the end bell members 17, 18. It is noted that the rods 15 used to connect the side plates 13, 14 of stand 12 are positioned at points on a circle whose diameter is equal to the diameter of the clamping rings and the flexible discs 22 in order to provide both support and alignment for these members during assembly and disassemblv Fig. 3 is a side partial section view illustrating the fixture assembly after the discs have been clamped therein.As seen in this Fig., a tension rod 31 extends longitudinally of the fixture assembly and provides an axially compressive force for the assembly in conjunction with the tensioning elements generally designated by the reference numeral 32, and described in more detail below in connection with Figs. 7 and 8. The rod 31 is inserted from the left hand portion of the assembly as viewed inFig. 3, is passed through the end bell 18 and the tensioning assembly 32 is thereafter engaged with rod 31 in order to draw the end bell members 17, 18 mutually together, thus clamping securely the peripheral portion of each disc 22 between the flatted clamping surfaces of the flanking clamping rings 16.After assembly of the fixture as shown in Fig. 3, the heat cure step is performed by placing the entire fixture assembly 10 minus stand 12 in a thermally controlled environment as illustrated inFig. 4. As seen in this Fig., the fixture Assembly 10 is placed within an oven whose boundary walls are generally designated by reference numeral 35 and left in the oven for the requisite period of time. In order to improve the curing process, the oven is provided with a plurality of rotatable support wheels 40 43 which engage grooves 25, 26 in end bell members 17, 18. At least one of the wheels i.e., wheel 40 of Fig. 4, is driven by a motor 44, preferably located externally of the oven walls 35, via a drive shaft 46 mounted in a bearing 47 in an aperture through oven walls 35.In order to improve the rotational motion of the assembly 10, grooves 25, 26 are optionally provided with a friction substance such as an elastic band 49 see Fig. 3 .In addition, a pair of side thrust bearings 51 are mounted at either end of assembly 10 in surface contact with the end surface of each end bell member 17, 18 in order to prevent axial run out during rotation. Thrust bearing elements 51 may be mounted in any suitable fashion and are schematically depicted as mounted for rotation about a vertical axis. The speed of rotation of the fixture assembly 10 does not appear to be critical and excellent results have been obtained at a speed of thirty revolutions per minute. The primary purpose of rotating the fixture assembly 10 is to promote the circulation of ambient heated air through the interior of the fixture assembly 10 to attempt to present a uniform thermal environment to the discs being cured. After the curing period has elapsed, the entire fixture assembly is removed from the oven and placed on a cooling stand shown in Figs. 5 and 6. As seen in these Figs., the cooling std is similar to support and assembly stand 12 and includes end plates 13, 14 and support strut rods 15. In addition, the cooling stand is preferably provided with an assembly rotation capability similar to that included in the oven, including support wheels 40 43, motor 44, drive shaft 46, and end thrust bearings 51. In use, the motor 44 is operated in order to rotate the assembly 10 for the requisite period of time required to cool down the flexible discs 22 to the desired temperature. After the discs 22 have cooled, the Assembly 10 is replaced onto the support stand 12 of Fig. 2., disassembled by separating the tension rod 31 and tensioning elements 32, after which the clamping rings 16 are separated and the discs 22 are removed. Figs. 7 and 8 illustrate the tension rod 31 and tensioning elements 32. As seen in these Figs., each end bell 17, 18 has a compound central bore with a tapered portion 61 and a counter bored portion 62. Located within the counter bored portion 62 is an insert generally designated by reference numeral 65 and having a cylindrical axial portion 66 and an annular flanged portion 67, with a centrally formed through bore 68. Rod 31 extends through the central throughbore 68 formed in each insert 65. At the left end as viewed in Fig. 7, rod 31 is provided with three radially extending pins 71 Fig. 8 each of which is received within an arcuate slot 69 formed in axial portion 66 of insert 65. Pins 71 lock rod 31 against rotation and also provide a tensioning force to end bell member 17 via insert 65. Mounted at the right end of rod 31, which is internally threaded as indicated by reference numeral 73, are the tensioning elements 32. Tensioning elements 32 include a hollow cylinder 76 into one end of which a cylindrical insert 77 is fitted. Press fitted into insert 77 is a threaded cap screw 78 which is threadably engaged with the adjacent end of rod 31. The inner end of element 76 has an inwardly turned flange portion 80 for retaining a spring element generally designated by reference numeral 82 which preferably comprises a plurality of Belleville washers 83. As shown in Fig. 7, when assembled and tensioned, the outer edge 66 of axial insert portion 66 bears against the spring element 82 for the purpose of compressing this element. As will now be evident, by tightening the tensioning elements 32 on rod 31 a compressive clamping force is provided along the axis of the rod 31, and thus between the end bell members 17, 18 and the clamping rings 16. With reference to Fig. 9, each clamping ring 16 is preferably provided with a thin layer 91 of a low friction material, such as TEFLON, preferably formed to a thickness in the range from about 1 4 mil o.ooo25in. to about 2 mils 0.002 in. This layer permits the disc to creep during curing in response to changing stresses in the substrate material and has been found to improve the quality of the finished discs. Figs. 10 and 11 illustrate a continuous flow embodiment of the invention. With reference to Fig. 10, a circular table 101 mounted for rotation about a vertical axis is provided with a plurality of clamping assemblies 102.A curing station 103 partially encloses the table 101 and assemblies 102. In use, the pre cured discs 22 are individually inserted in serial fashion into a clamping assembly 102 at a loading station, are moved into the curing station 103 and are withdrawn after curing from an unloading station. The table 101 may be either continuously rotated, or indexed in a step like fashion. Fig. 11 illustrates a single clamping assembly 102 and the associated radiation sources As seen in thisFig., the clamping assembly 102 comrpises complementary upper and lower members 111,112, respectively, each provided with an extremely flat clamping surface 113 formed to a flatness substantially identical to that provided for clamping rings 16. In addition, each member 111, 112 is preferably provided with the low friction layer 91 noted above. Either one of members 111,112 or both are mounted to table 101 by conventional motion translating mechanisms schematically depicted as hydraulic cylinders 114 to permit vertical reciprocation between a closed clamping position and an open position in which discs 22 may be inserted and withdrawn. Preferably, upper member 111 is constructed as a vacuum chuck to facilitate loading of the discs 22.A pair of radiation sources, preferably infra red lamps 115, 116 as depicted, are mounted above and below the clamping assembly in a position to direct the radiation to the disc surfaces.If desired, sources 115, 116 may be mounted in focussing reflectors, such as a parabolic reflector, to improve the transmission of radiation to the disc. It is understood that a plurality of such sources are distributed within curing station 103. A feedback sensor 118, preferably coated with a sample of the recording composition, is mounted adjacent the disc 22 to monitor the curing process. Sensor 118 may comprise any one of a number of known temperature sensitive devices, such as a thermistor, capable of generating electrical signals representative of local temperature. If desired, sensor 118 may be coupled to a control device for regulating the radiation output of the sources, such as a power supply, to a table speed regulator, or to both. Such arrangements are well known to those skilled in the art. In order to further improve the energy efficiency of the system of Figs. 10 and 11, the inside surfaces of clamping members 111, 12 may be polished or plated with a highly reflective material, such as gold. As noted supra, upper member 111 may be constructed as a vacuum chuck to facilitate loading of the discs 22.To this end, member 111 is provided with longitudinally extending air passages 119 enclosed at the upper end by a manufold 120 having common air passages 121 coupled by means of a conduit 122 to a conventional vacuum source and valve apparatus. If desired, the lower member 112 may be so constructed. In addition, at least one of members 111, 112 is preferably provided with a registration guide not illustratedj to facilitate loading of the discs 22 in a centralized fashion. Examples of a suitable guide are pins depending from the outer periphery of upper member 111, an arcuate shield also depending from upper member 111, and the like. As will be apparent to those skilled in the art, the temperature within the curing station 103 and the speed of table 101 are selected to provide the requisite amount of curing for the discs 22 while ensuring maximum disc throughput. These parameters can be best established in an empirical fashion. It should be noted that separation of the clamping rings 16 from the peripheral disc surfaces can be facilitated by applying a thin film of a suitable mold release agent to the ring clamping surface prior to tensioning of the fixture assembly 10. Examples of suitable agents are parting agent 1914A sold by Hasting Plastics of Santa Monica, California Krylon 1348 paintable silicon spray mold release sold by Border, Inc., of Columbus, Ohio and Premium Silicone spray lubricant sold by Oak MaterialsGroups of Hoosick Falls, New York. Other suitable release agents will occur to those skilled in the art. Flexible recording discs fabricated in accordance with the invention exhibit more uniform thermal and hygroscopic stress characteristics and further possess a surface flatness having deviations no greater than about .005 inch dynamic runout as measured in the jacket of the finished disc assembly. As a result, track densities can be increased in such flexible recording discs without sacrificing the integrity of data recorded thereon. The following is an example illustrating process parameters involved in practicing the invention. A magnetizable particle dispersion was prepared by adding 68.0 parts by weight of y Fe203 to 53.4 parts by weight of cyclohexanone and 51.5 parts by weight of cellosolve acetate. To this blend, 16.3 parts by weight of 60 EPON 1001, 4.8 parts by weight of carbon black, and 0.7 parts by weight of TEN LO 70 a non ionic surfactant produced by Nopco Chemical Division were added this mixture was then stirred from 1 to 4 hours, and subsequently milled until free from agglomerates. Then 5.0 parts by weight of a 5 ferric acetylacetonate solution, 80 parts by weight of 6 EAB 272 20 CAB solution, 3.7 parts by weight of IJUBRICIN N l, and 23.0 parts by weight of the triisocyanate mixture were added to the milled mixture. Lastly, 92.0 parts of cyclohexanone were added to adjust the final viscosity to approximate 300 to 350 centipoise at 240 C. The viscosity was measured by a Brookfield viscometer, number 2 spindle at 20 rpm. The compositions were then spin coated on a MYLAR polyester substrate for production of a flexible magnetic memory disc. The disc coating was then pre cured for approximately 40 seconds at approximately 900 C to drive off the solvents, after which several such pre cured discs were assembled in fixture 10 and heated in an oven at a temperature of 1400 C for a period of 20 minutes. The fixtured discs were then removed, placed on the cooling stand of Figs. 5 and 6 and permitted to cool for approximately 30 minutes. Thereafter, the fixture 10 was dissembled and the cured discs were removed. While the above provides a complete description of the preferred embodiments of the invention, various modifications, alternate constructions and equivalents may be employed as desired. For example, while a continuous process embodiment has been described with reference to circular geometry, other geometrical configurations may be employed, such as a linear system in which the loading and unloading stations are located at opposite ends of a curing station. Therefore, the above description and illustrations should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention, which is defined by the appended claims.
