# Element for electrophoresis.

## Abstract
An element for electrophoresis suitably employable for electrophoresis of biopolymers such as proteins, as well as for determination of base sequence of DNA, RNA, their frag ments, and their derivatives, which comprises a plastic sup port, an adhesive layer containing a cellulose derivative, and an electrophoresis medium layer comprising an aqueous po lyacrylamide gel formed by crosslinking polymerization of an acrylamide compound and a crosslinking agent in the pres ence of water, which are superposed in this order. The elec trophoresis medium layer may contain a water soluble polymer and agarose. The medium layer may contain a mod ifier such and an anionic surfactant, formamide or urea.
