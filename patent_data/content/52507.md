# Percussive drills.

## Abstract
A percussive drill comprises a bit holder 1,8,9 , a percussive drive including a ram 5 slidably mounted in a hollow piston 6 , drive means 4 for reciprocating the ram in the piston via an air cushion, the forward travel of the ram during percussive action of the drill being limited by a drill bit or an intermediate member 7 interposed between the drill bit and the ram, and means for holding the ram in a position further forward than said limited travel when percussive action is not desired. The holding means includes a resilient annular hollow section member 25 which is entered by the ram 5 as it moves to said position further forward, the ram forming a seal therewith, and the member 25 also acts as an energy absorbing buffer for absorbing the energy of an impact by the ram.
