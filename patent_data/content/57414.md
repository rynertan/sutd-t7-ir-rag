# Brush shifting and trigger switch arrangements for a portable tool.

## Abstract
A portable electric tool has an elongated lever 16 pivoted 22 intermediate its length and contained fully within the tool housing 2 . The rear end 42 of the lever 16 operates a reversing switch 14 , and the forward end 24 of the lever engages in an actuating member 28 slidabie along a transverse slot 74 in the lower wall 34 of the motor compartment 6 . Intermediate the forward end of the lever 16 and its pivotal axis 22 , a downwardiy projecting pin 36 coacts with a par tition 40 in the upper part of the trigger 12 of a trig ger switch 10 to prevent pivoting of the lever 16 while the trigger 10 is in an inward position energizing the tool. A brush board assembly 56 is rotatably mount ed in bearings 106, 112 , and has a stud 66 engaged by an upwardly extending forked arm 68 of the lever 16 . With the trigger switch in the off position, the lever 16 is pivoted by the member 28 to simultane ously rotate the brush board assembly 56 and actuate the reversing switch 14 for the chosen direction of rotation of the motor 44 .
