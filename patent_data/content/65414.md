## Description
A NUT LOCKING UNIT BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a nut locking unit for preventing a nut from loosening under vibration or any other external causes. More particularly, the present invention relates to a nut locking unit comprising a washer used in association with a nut to prevent the same from loosening under vibration or any other external causes, wherein the nut and the washer have respective means whereby they are engaged with each other, the engaging means being eccentrically provided so as to produce an axial deviation from one to another. For a nut locking unit the Inventor of the present invention contrived a device commonly called a double nut system. This system, as its name implies, employs two nuts One of the nuts has a projecting head and the other has a recess adapted to receive the head, thereby securing a union of the two nuts, wherein either of the head or the recess has its axis deviated from the axis of a bolt to be fastened. Thus, when the head is inserted in the recess of the other nut, the two nuts are eccentrically met. This prior invention is disclosed in the JapaneseUtility Model Publication No.36123 75. The basic idea underlying the prior invention is to utilize a wedge effect provided by an eccentric engagement of the head of one nut with the recess of another. It has been found that once the nut has been tightened in this way, the lock lasts virtually permanently. Since the threads in each nut are safe from wearing after repeated use, the locking effect remains effective. In spite of these advantages the double nut system has some disadvantages as follows Because of the employment of two nuts the fastening work consists of two steps, and becomes troublesome. The vertically overlaid nuts occupy so much space along the length of a bolt to be fastened, which limits the application of this system only to when a sufficient space exists along the bolt. OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention aims at solving the problems mentioned above with respect to the double nut system, and has for its object to provide an improved nut locking unit capable of simplifying the fastening procedure and facilitating the locking work. Other objects and advantages will become apparent from the detailed description given hereinafter it should be understood, however, that the detailed description and specific embodiments are given by way of illustration, since various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this detailed description. According to the present invention a nut locking unit includes a nut having internal screw threads engageable with the external screw threads of a bolt to be fastened, and a washer having a bore allowing said bolt to pass through, said nut having a first means and said washer having a second means whereby said nut and said washer are effectively engaged with each other, either of said first means or second means having an axis eccentric with the axis of said bolt.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Referring to Figures 1 and 2 a nut 1 has a recess 4 in its seat face 3, wherein the recess 4 is shaped like a truncated cone with a diameter large than that of a threaded hole 2. The reference numeral 5 designates a tapered inside wall of the recess 4. The recess 4 and the threaded hole 2 are made concentric. Figures 3 and 4 show a washer 6 to be used in association with the nut 1, and they constitute a nut locking unit. The washer 6 has a bore 7 and a tapered outside wall 9, which defines a projecting head 8. The head 8 is designed to be insertable in the recess 4 of the nut 1 with the tapered inside wall 5 and the tapered outside wall 9 being fitted. The tapered outside wall 9 has an axis B which is slightly deviated from an axis A of the bore 7. The amount of the deviation of the axis B from the axis A is indicated by e . The washer 6 can be made either of metal or plastics. It is also possible that the bore 7 is provided with threads in its inner surface, so as to allow same to engage with threads 13 of a bolt 12. This modified version has an advantage that the internally threaded washer 6 can double the fastening effect without increasing the height and weight as a whole. Figures 5 and 6 show that two fixtures 10 and 11 are united by the bolt 12, which is locked by the nut 1 and the washer 6. Initially, the washer 6 is placed with a threaded portion 13 of the bolt 12 inserted in the bore 7, and then, the nut 1 is turned around the threaded portion 13 of the bolt 12 until the recess 4 meets the head 8 of the washer 6. In this case, since the axis B of the tapered outside wall 9 is deviated by e from the axis A of the bore 7, that is, the axis of the bolt 12, a wedge action occurs between the tapered walls 5 and 9 as the nut 1 advances along the threaded portion 13 of the bolt 12. In Figure 6 the wedge action acts in the direction indicated bythe arrow, that is, at right angle to the axis of the bolt 12. This wedge action works more strongly as the nut 1 advances thread by thread, thereby increasing the locking effect upon the nut 1.The amount of deviation e is required to fall in an allowable range if it is too large, the bolt 12 is likely to be deformed, or the head 8 and the recess 4 will fail to meet properly. The amount of deviation e must be devided so as to attain the locking effect. Referring to Figures 7 to 10, a modified version of the embodiment will be explained The illustrated nut 1 has a recess 4a defined by a tapered inside wall 5a, whose axis D is deviated by e from the axis C of the threaded hole 2, that is, of a bolt to be fastened. A mating washer 6a has a bore 7, and a projecting head 8a defined by a tapered outside wall 9a. The axis of the tapered outside wall 9a is concentric with that of the bore 7. In this embodiment the same locking effect can be attained. Referring to Figures 11 to 14, a further modified version of the embodiment will be explained The nut 1 has a projecting head 8b in its seat face, which head 8b is defined by a tapered outside wall 9b.The tapered outside wall 9b and the threaded hole 2 are concentric. The washer 6b illustrated in Figure 13 has a bore 7 and a recess 4b defined by a tapered inside wall 5b. The axis of the recess 4b is deviated by e from that of the bore, that is, of a bolt to be fastened. However, a reverse arrangement is possible, that is, the bore 7 and the recess 4b are made concentric, while the axis of the projecting head 8b is deviated by e from that of the threaded hole 2, that is, of a bolt to be fastened. As evident from the foregoing description, the two nuts in the prior double nut system have been replaced by a combination of a nut and a washer, thereby resulting in a simplified fastening procedure. The fastening can be done in the routine manner in which a nut is fastened against a washer. The total size of the nut locking unit is minimized and made light, particularly when the washer is made of plastic Nevertheless, the locking effect is advantageously as strong. as that achieved by the prior double nut system.
