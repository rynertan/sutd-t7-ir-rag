# Optical temperature sensor utilizing birefringent crystals.

## Abstract
A temperature sensor comprising an optical transducer member having an array of birefringent crystals 32 . The length and, accordingly, the sensitivity to temperature change of successive birefringent crystals 32 varies according to a particular relationship. The transducer is interconnected with a fiber optic transmission 26,38 and detecting system 40 . Respective optical output signals that are transmitted from the birefringent crystals 32 via the fiber optic transmission system 38 are detected 40 and decoded 42 so as to cor respond to digits of a numbering system, whereby an accu rate digital representation of temperature can ultimately be provided.
