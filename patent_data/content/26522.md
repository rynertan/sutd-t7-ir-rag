# A method for the manufacture of a printed, pre creased packing material web provided with opening indication.

## Abstract
The manufacture is realized so that a first wider web 2 of paper or cardboard, whose width is a multiple of the desired packing material webs, is provided with impressed crease line patterns and opening arrangements, whereupon the paper or cardboard web is covered with plastics. The wider web so treated is then cut into a number of partial webs 11 , each of a width corresponding to the width of a complete crease line pattern, which partial webs are rolled up into large rolls intended for transport which in a separate printing operation are provided with text and decoration and are rolled up into magazine rolls of packing material of the desired size.
