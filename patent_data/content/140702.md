# EXHAUST BRAKING SYSTEM FOR AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE

## Abstract
An exhaust braking system used with an internal com bustion engine has an inlet valve 3 an exhaust valve 4 , an exhaust brake 11 connected in an exhaust system con nected with the exhaust valve, and an actuator 16 connect ed in a fluid circuit 14 with the exhaust brake. The exhaust brake is closed to retard the rotational speed of the engine and an induction valve 8 connected in an induction pas sage 7 to the inlet valve 3 and in the fluid circuit 13, 14 with the exhaust brake 11 is also operated to facilitate en gine speed retardation. Timing apparatus 13, 14 is con nected with the induction valve 8 and exhaust brake 11 to ensure the exhaust brake is closed no later than the closing of the induction valve, whilst a non return valve 17 is con nected in the induction passage to facilitating an increase in pressure within a piston cylinder 1, 2 of the engine and hence increase the engine retardation. A pressure sensitive device 18 connected in the induction passage or exhaust system controls the maximum pressure of the braking sys tem. Preferably, the pressure sensitive means 18 is a pressure release valve. The method of operating the ex haust braking system is also disclosed.
