# Device for mounting an object to a post.

## Abstract
An object is secured to a circular post by a steel strap connected to the object being passed around the post and its ends interconnected to hold the strap tightly around the post. The connector may be a steel buckle 140 or a screw 136 . A flange 18, 139, 138 is formed in the buckle 140 , the strap 130 or a sheet steel component 134 associated therewith to provide an inward edge which bears upon the post when the strap is tightened, and thereby resists rotational displacement of the object around the post.
