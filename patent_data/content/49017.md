## Description
Alkoxylated quaternary ammonium borates and their use as fabric softening agents. The esent invention relates to a class of quaternary ammonium cold pounds. More particularly, this invention relates to a class of quaternary ammonium borate compounds and their use as fabric softeners. This inve ntion further relates to fabric softening compositions containing such quaternary ammonium borates and to methods of softening textiles employing such compounds and compositions.It has been long recognized in the art that certain quaternary ammonium i compounds have the capability of imparting softness to textile fabrics. Of particular interest is a class of alkoxylated quaternary ammonium compounds wherein an alkoxyalkyl or a poly oxyalkyl group is bonded to the nitrogen. Such alkoxylated quaternary ammonium compounds have been generally found to exist as chloride salts. Thus, quaternary ammonium compounds of certain structure for subject use, either alone or in combination with other additives, are for instance disclosed inUS 3 546 115, US 3 660 459, DE 27 30 302 and EP 001 3820. One concern of users of such guaternary ammonium compounds is liquidity of the product. Thus, it is desirable that fabric softening compounds be as liquid11 as possible to reduce the necessity, for example, of utilizing heated railroad cars for transportation of the bulk compound, or the use of heated holding tanks and transfer lines to assure that the compound is maintained in a liquid state. This is especially true in view of the recent desirability to minimize the energy which is needed for. any type of processing. Therefore, if a more liquid product is produced, the amount of energy required to transport and store the product is minimized.Also, liquid products are generally cold water dis persible, negating the need to heat water to make diluted solutions or dispersions of the concentrated softener. Another concern when quaternary ammonium compounds are utilized as fabric softening compounds is the solvent. Ideally, compounds relatively free of volatile, flammable and or odor producing solvents that serve only as a reaction media and have no softening effect are preferred.A further concern when using quaternary ammonium compounds relates to the ease of formulating various compositions containing such compounds.In this regard it is highly desirable to employ cold water dispersible quaternary ammonium compounds.An object of the present invention is to provide a class of quaternary ammonium compounds which are effective fabric softeners. In addition it is an object of the present invention to provide a class of quaternary ammonium compounds which in addition to softening fabrics produce des ir 1 able rewet and antistatic characteristics in treated fabrics.Furthermore, an object of the present invention is to provide a class of quaternary ammonium compounds which exhibit increased liquidity over, other prior art compounds.An additional object is to produce a class of compounds relatively free of volatile, flammable and or odor producing solvents that serve onlul as a reaction media and have no value for providing softening.It is also an object of the present invention to provide a class of cold pounds which are readily formulated into fabric softening compositions.In addition it is an object of the present invention to provide quarter nary ammonium compounds which are cold water dispersible.The compounds of the present invention are represented by the following formulaeEMI2.1 wherein R is selected from the class consisting of aliphatic radical containing from about 6 to about 22 carbon atoms, a R5 CmH I grqup wherein R5 is alkoxy containing from 6 to 22 carbon atoms and m is an integer of from 2 to 6, and aEMI3.1 group, wherein R6 is alkyl containing from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, z is an integer of from 1 to 10 and each R is independently hydrogen or I methyl each R1, which may be the same or different, is independently I selected from the class consisting of C2H3R O xH groups, wherein x is an integer of from 1 to 20 and each R is independently hydrogen or methyl R2 is methyl or a group selected from the class represented by R1 R3 is a group selected from the class represented by R or R2 n is an integer of from 2 to 6 a and b are independently 0 or 1 provided that the sum of a b is greater than zero and c is the sum of a b.The long chain aliphatic radicals represented by R and R3 contain from about 6 to about 22 carbon atoms. Preferably, the aliphatic radicals contain from about 12 to about 18 carbon atoms. The aliphatic groups may be either straight chain or branched aliphatic radicals. In addition, the aliphatic radicals may be either saturated groups, and thus alkyl, or may be unsaturated groups, and thus alkenyl. It is most preferred that the aliphatic radicals represented by R and R3 be alkyl or alkenyl containing from about 12 to 18 carbon atoms. Typically, such radicals are derived from, for example, animal fatty acids such as tallow fatty. acids or grease acids Flomkoy fat , hydrogenated tallow fatty acids, and coconut fatty acids. It is preferred that each x in the C2H3R O xH B groups re x presented by R1 be from 1 to about 5. it is most preferred that the sum of all the x s in the groups represented by R1 in either the compounds of formula I or formula If be equal to twenty. It is further preferred that R is methyl. In addition it is preferred that R is hydrogen. But, if R is methyl, it is preferred that the repeating alkylene moiety C2z3R O t be represented by the formula EMI4.1 It is to be understood that the C2H3R O xH radicals repre . sented by R1 containing more than one alkylene moiety, i.e. x i greater than one, may contain alkylene moieties wherein all the R s arM the same or different. If x is two, radicals represented by R1 inn dude for exampleEMI4.2 In the compounds of the present invention represented by formula II it is preferred that n is 3. It is further preferred that a and b are each one.If R is a R5 CmH2m group it is preferred that m is 3 and m is alkoxy containing from 10 to 18 carbon atoms. The preferred embodiments of the compounds of formula I are repre sented by the formulae EMI4.3 EMI5.1 wherein R and h are selected from the class consisting of aliphatic radicals containing from about 6 to about 22 carbon atoms and R1 is a CH2 a 2xH group wherein x is an integer of from 1 to 5. Compounds of formulae IV and V are more preferred and the compound of formulae V is most preferred.The compounds of formula I may be prepared in accordance with following procedure th An amine of the formulaEMI5.2 wherein R is above defined. M is hydrogen or methyl and M is hydrogen, methyl or an aliphatic radical containing from about 6 to about 22 carbon atoms is treated with boric acid. The resulting mixture i treated with an alkylene oxide s of the formulaEMI5.3 wherein R is hydrogen or methyl to produce the N alkoxylatet quaternary ammonium borates of formula I . A surprising aspect of thine process for preparing the compounds of the present invention is that unlike similar compounds wherein the anion is chloride, acetate, phosphate, etc., the reaction of the amine and boric acid does not produce an intermediate amine salt.The formation of an intermediate amine salt was previously deemed necessary in order to produce an alkoxylated product.Although it is preferred to employ boric acid, other sources of borate may be employed. Borate salts such as sodium tetraborate and borate esters such as trimethylborate which are readily hydrolyzed to boric acid may be employed. However if borate salts or borate esters are employed, water must be present in the reaction mixture.The above procedure is generally carried out in a closed reaction vessel at a temperature of from 40 110 C with a temperature of 70 110 C being preferred and under a pressure in a range of 5 60 psig with 20 psig being preferred. Altough a catalyst is not necessary, an acid catalyst such as Ertoluenesulfonic acid, methane sulfonic acid, sulfuric acid and the like, may be employed. If a catalyst is employed, ptoluene sulfonic acid is preferred. Although not narrowly critical, the time of reaction should be sufficient to permit the reaction to proceed the completion. A reaction time period of 6 hours is generally sufficient.The molar ratio between the amine of formula VII and boric acid may vary, but about 1 mole of boric acid is preferably reacted with about 1 mole of amine. It is most preferred to employ 1.25 1.50 moles of boric acid per mole of amine.It should be noted that unlike the procedures for preparing quaternary ammonium chlorides, acetates, etc., a solvent is not required in the preparation of the borates. However, if desired a solvent which will not react with the reactants may be employed. Illustrative of such solvents include for example, water, mineral oil, alcohols, such as isopropanol, ethylene glycol, hexylene glycol and the like, and esters of acetic acid.If a solvent is to be utilized, it is preferred to employ water or isopropanol. The amines of formula Cvii employed in accordance with the above procedures are either commercially available or prepared in accordance with known techniques.To prepare the compounds of formula it , a diamine of the formulaEMI6.1 wherein R and n are above defined and M is hydrogen or a group selected from the class represented by Rj is employed in the above described procedure in lieu of the amine of formula VII . Such diamines are also either commercially available or prepared in accordance with known techniques. If a diamine of formula IX is employed in the above procedure, a molar ratio of borie acid to diamine of about 2 1 is per ferred. It is most preferred to employ an excess of boric acid.The following illustrative, non limiting examples will serve to further demonstrate those of ordinary skill in the art the manner in which specific compounds within the scope of this invention can be prepared.1Example 1A one liter Carp. 20 steel autoclave was charged with 400 g. 0.800 mole of di hydrogenated tallow amine Armee 2HT from Armak Company,Chicago, Illinois , 74.2g 1.201 g. mole of boric acid, 23.7 g. 3.7 of total charge of isopropyl alcohol and 141 g. 3.2 g. mole ethylene oxide.The resulting mixture was heated to 100 C and digested until the reactor head pressure levelled off at about 5 psig. to yield a product having the following analysis 91.8 solids 5.1 ethylene glycol, 5.0 diethylene glycol, 1.0 triethylene glycol, 0.20 me 10 free amine, and 1.05 meq g. 68.2 quaternary borate.
