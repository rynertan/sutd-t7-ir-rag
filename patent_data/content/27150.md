# Apparatus for forming and installing underground drainpipe.

## Abstract
The pipe 23 is formed from a web 18 of porous or non porous sheet plastic which is drawn from a dispensing roll 17 through curling and shaping devices 19,11,22 protected by a transparent shield 24 to provide a tube, these devices being mounted on a frame 11 positionable in a trench or other depression in the soil. The end of the tube is attached to a mole 28 at the end of a power driven blade, with the mole forming an underground passage for the following tube. Tensioning and positioning rollers 44, 46 are carried on the frame to feed the web to the tube forming devices at a predetermined angle and tension. A pressor roller 66,74 and its support bracket 75 interengage complimentary tongues and slots formed along the edges of the web for holding the web in its tubular form.
