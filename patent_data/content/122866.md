# TEMPERATURE DATA RECORDER AND METHOD OF STORING DATA

## Abstract
A number of temperatures and events indicative of the operation of a refrigeration system are recorded chronologi cally. The memory is filled and overwritten in such a way that the memory contains full data for the most recent events to the extent of memory storage capacity. Depending upon whether the recorder is in continuous use, the memory will contain data for the last 62 days of use with storage in memory for at least a year.
