# Undercoating composition.

## Abstract
An undercoating composition for a fluorocarbon polymer coating comprising a a modified tetrafluoroethylene polymer in the form of parti cles of double layer structure having a core and a shell, the core comprising a tetrafluoroethylene homopolymer or a copo lymer of tetrafluoroethylene with a fluorine containing α olefin, the shell comprising a copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene and said fluorine containing α olefin copolymerized therewith in a larger amount than in the core, b a copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene and said fluorine con taining α olefin, and c an auxiliary adhesive agent selected from the group con sisting of polyimide, polybismaleimide, polyamideimide and aromatic polyamide.
