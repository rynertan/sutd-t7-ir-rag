# Polyurethane foams.

## Abstract
A flexible, flame retardant polyetherurethane foam is produced by reacting, under foam forming conditions, a polymeric polyol component optionally including a non halogenated diol , an organic polyisocyanate, an isocyanate reactive additive to act as a flame retardant, and one or more non isocyanate reactive compounds of phosphorus and nit rogen to act an intumescent agents. Foams so made are resistant to severe fire sources, including wooden cribs.

## Description
POLYURETHANE FOAMS This invention relates to polyurethane foams and in particular to flexible polyurethane foams which, on exposure to a flame, melt and char, thus protecting the foam from continued burning. It is well known that many flexible polyetheruret hane foams, e.g. high resilient and Neomorphic foams, melt on exposure to a flame. This melting cause the effective withdrawal of the foam fi.3m thu proximi ty or the flame. Although such behaviour reduces the hazard from small flame sources, , mclting of the foam gives rise to the formation of drips which miy themselves ignite and create a further hazard. Moreover, such foams suffer from the additional disadvantage that they burn readily when subjected to a relatively severe fire source such as burning piper or a wooden crib . When a foam is ignited, molten material is formed and flammable gases are evolved. It Ls therefore desirable to increase the rate of melting of the foam thus physically removing the foam from the fire source as well as to suppress the evolution of flammable gases and to render the melt more thermally stable thereby making the melt more difficult to ignite . In addition, any increase in the thermal stability of tile melt sliould preferably I,e accompanied by the formation of a protective char layer on the outer surface of the melt thus preventing any lurther combustion . There have been many prior proposals with the object of attaining one or more of the above mentioned desiderata.However, such prior proposals have generally involved the incorporation of one or more flame retardant andsor intumescent additives into a conventional foam forming mixture or the post treatment of an already produced foam, at a level of addition which adversely affects the physical properties of the foam. We have now found that, by means of a method according to the present invention, a polyethereurethane foam is produced wliich is not only substantially non burning in the molten state but is also resistant to burning under relatively severe flammability conditions.Moreover, the method of the present invention produces a foam having acceptable physical properties. Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for the production of a flexible polyurethane foam, the method comprising the reaction of a polymeric polyol component and an organic polyisocyanate under foam forming conditions, in which the foam forming reaction mixture also contains a an isocyanate reactive additive which remains in the finished foam and acts as a flame retardant when the foam is exposed to a flame and b one or more non isocyanate reactive compounds of phosphorus and nitrogen which1 when the finished foam is melted by exposure to a flame, cause the melt to intumesce and char. The present invention also provides a polyetherurethane foam made by the method described in the immediately preceding paragraph. The polymeric polyol component may include a nonhalogenated diol, particularly when it is intended to produce a high resilient foam product. The additive a may be a halogenated unsaturated low molecular weight diol e.g. dibromobutene diol or a triol. This additive can be used, in accordance with the present invention, to replace some or all of the non halogenated diol conventionally included in the polymeric polyol component in the preparation of a highresilient polyether foam. Preferably, this replacement is on a mole for mole basis and may amount to a replacement level of 100 . The additive s b may be, for example, a halogenated phosphate ester e.g. tetrakis 2 chloroethyl ethylene diphosphate and or an ammonium polyphosphate. Other additives, including flame retardants known per se e.g. hydrated alumina and borax may be incorporated into the foam forming reaction mixture. We have found that borax, together with a halogenated phosphate ester and an ammonium polyphosphate, shows a synergistic flame retardant effect on the products.

Both the control and the modified foans were subjected to Oxygen Index , Burning Melt and Crib tests.OXYGEN INDEX TEST This is a measure of the oxygen concentration in nitrogen at which a sample will sustain candle like burning. It is carried out as described in ASTMSpecification D 2863 77 equivalent to B.S.S. 27b 2 pt. I . BURNING MELT TEST 12 5g of each foam was melted into an aluminium cup and heated from above by means of a Bunsen flame for 15 seconds. The flame was removed and the time for the sample to extinguish was noted. The sample was heated for a further 20 seconds and the cxtinguishing time again recorded.

A double crib, comprising two cribs, each weighing 63 and consisting of ten soft wood blocks of dimensions 80 x 12.5 x 12.5 mm was placed on the wrapped foam. Wood wool 3g was placed in each crib. The wood wool was ignited and the course of combustion observed. On testing the modified foam, the emission of flame and smoke ceased within 2 minutes of the cribs extinguishing. By contrast, when the control foam was subjected to the crib test it burnt completely
