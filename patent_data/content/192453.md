# Needle guard.

## Abstract
A needle guard 10 has a centrally disposed aperture 14, 41, 51 for the reception of a tubular needle cover 22 used to house disposable needles for hypodermic syringes. The needle guard 10 is formed from a needle puncture resistant but resilient plastic so that it can frictionally grip the needle cover 22 as the guard is slid over the cover. The cover is cup shaped with outwardly extending flanges 16 to prevent it from rolling when placed on a surface. The cover can be ejected from the guard and its use with a disposable container 30 is described.

## Description
Title Needle Guard DESCRIPTION This invention relates to a guard for needles or like instruments. Needles used on hypodermic syringes or those used to take blood samples are typically provided with a needle cover in the form of a tubular sleeve having a closed end so that the tip of the needle is encased within the sleeve. Soiled or used needles can give rise to the risk of transmission of diseases such as Hepatitus B or AIDS as it is not uncommon for health professionals to prick themselves with needles after use as they endeavour to dispose of the needles or insert them into their needle covers prior to disposal. This problem is so serious that the Centre for Disease Control recommends that the used needles are not returned to their needle covers. Various needle packages have been proposed but none of them have solved the problem of how to avoid the risk of needle pricks with the conventional tubular needle covers which are widely used today. Examples of such prior art needle packages include U. S. Patent 4,287,988 Syringe sheath guide U. S. Patent 3,101,841 Needle package U. S. Patent 3,149,717 Container for hypodermic needle U. S. Patent 3,294,331 Dental needle shield U. S. Patent 3,329,146 Needle container U. S. Patent 3,333,682 Disposable needle container U. S. Patent 3,342,319 Rigid tubular syringe package It is an object of this invention to provide a needle guard which can be used with tubular needle covers and which f minimises the risk of needle tricks when inserting a needle into its needle cover, or removing it therefrom. In one aspect, the invention provides a needle guard for use with a tubular cover having an opening at one end for a disposable hypodermic needle or the like, said guard including a body of needle puncture resistant material having an aperture therethrough capable of receiving and holding the cover as it is positioned in the aperture, said body extending outwardly from the aperture so as to shield a user s hand from a needle as it is inserted into the cover held in the body. Preferably the body is in the form of a cup or socket having an aperture therein capable of receiving a needle cover. Alternatively, the body may be in the form of an apertured disc or other shape to form a shield or guard about the mouth of the needle cover. In a second aspect, the invention provides a method of handling needles or like instruments wherein a needle within a needle cover is provided with an outwardly extending shield portion, the needle is removed from its cover and after use is inserted into a shielded needle cover which is held with the shield between the user s hand and the entrance end of the cover. Optionally the used needle and its needle cover may be ejected from the shield portion. In a third aspect, the invention provides a container for used needles having an aperture therein capable of allowing a needle cover to be pushed therethrough but small enough to prevent the entry of a needle guard as described in any of the previous aspects of this invention. These and other aspects of this invention, which should be considered in all its novel aspects, will become apparent from the following description, which is given by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a cross section through a preferred needle guard Figure 2 shows a cut away view of the needle guard, with a needle cover in place, showing how it can be held in the hand whilst a needle is in a position to be inserted into its cover Figure 3 shows a container for the disposal of needles and needle covers, with a needle guard positioned on the container Figure 4 is a side view of the needle guard ofFigure 1 Figure 5 is a perspective view of the needle guard of Figure 1 Figure 6 is a top plan view of the needle guard ofFigure 1 Figure 7 shows a cross section through an alternative needle guard, positional on a needle cover Figure 8 shows a cross section through a further needle guard, having provision for a needle cover and container for a liquid. Turning now to Figures 1 to 6, a preferred needle guard 10 is in a form of a cup or socket which is conveniently formed from a plastics material, although other materials may be used. The material is preferably resilient enough to assist in gripping a needle cover, but is tough enough to prevent a needle being inadvertently pushed therethrough. The needle guard 10 is formed with a base 11 and sidewalls 12. As shown, the sidewalls 12 may be slightly tapered to present a relatively wide entry 13 with the sidewalls 12 assisting in deflecting or directing a needle towards the approximately central aperture 14. Optionally, an internal rib 15 may be provided of such a size that the needle guard can be clicked over the end of a needle holder not shown , so that the guard can be conveniently held in place when not required for use with a cover. Although the needle guard may be made of any convenient size, we have found that a suitable size for the needle guard involves a base of diameter of approximately 32 millimetres, and an entrance 13 of approximately 38 millimetres. This enables a single guard size to be produced from one mould but allowing for aperture sizes 14 created by using different mould pins to thus accommodate different sizes of needle covers from small to large. Although these sizes are given by way of example only and are not to be construed as in any way limiting the invention, it will be appreciated that such a size enables the guard 10 to provide a reasonable shield for the user s hand see Figure 2 whilst inserting a needle into a needle cover, yet on the other hand the needle guard is of relatively compact size and thus may be readily carried by a user and or packed with a supply of needles, and or attached to the end of a needle holder e. g. the type of holder for use with needles for the collection of blood samples . Preferably, the needle guard 10 is provided with anti roll means on the exterior thereof to minimise risk of the needle guard rolling off a bench or the like.This is conveniently achieved by providing flats 16 on the exterior of the sidewall 12, preferably three such flats as shown in Figure 6. Alternatively, the needle guard can be provided with a plurality of sidewalls, erg, the needle guard may be square, hexagonal, or any other . verbar polygonal shape when viewed Figure 2 also shows a hypodermic needle 20 which is push fit within a needle cover 22. This cover 22 typically has a shoulder 23 adJacent its open end. Figure 2 shows a needle cover 22 inserted through the aperture 14 of a needle guard 10 so that its shoulder 23 abuts against the underside of the base 11. In this position, the needle cover 22 may be held in one hand and the needle pulled out of the needle cover typically when the needle is attached to a syringe or needle holder . After use, the needle can then be inserted into the needle cover with minimal risk of the user being pricked by the needle, as the user s hand is shielded by the needle guard as the needle is presented towards the open end of the needle cover. When the needle is inserted into the needle cover it may be disengaged from the syringe or other needle holder. The spent needle and needle cover can then be removed by pushing it out of the needle guard. Preferably a disposal container 30 is provided having an aperture 31 in the lid thereof just slightly larger than the diameter of the needle cover and its associated shoulder 23, but with the aperture 31 in the lid being less than the diameter of the needle guard. By this means, the needle guard can be placed over the aperture 31 and the needle cover pushed downwardly in the direction of arrow 32 so that it is erected directly into the container as shown by spent needle and needle cover 33. In order to facilitate the gripping action of the needle guard about the needle cover, it is preferred that the aperture 14 is tapered so that it presents a slightly larger diameter on the inner side of the base 11 than on the outer side of the base 11. This also facilitates the insertion and or ejection of the needle cover from aperture 14. Figures 7 and 8 show alternative embodiments.Figure 7 shows a needle guard in the form of a flat disc or washer 40 which grips the cover 22 and functions in a similar fashion to the guard of Figure 1. It can be a round disc, or more preferably rectanuular or other nonround shape to prevent the guard and cover from rolling when placed on a surface. The washer 40 preferably has a central aperture 41 with a taper 42 to facilitate gripping of the needle cover 22 as it is slid over the cover. The needle guard 50 of Figure 8 has an off centre aperture 51 for a needle cover 52 and one or more chambers 54 for liquids 55. Chamber 54 is conveniently formed by a container which fits into an aperture 55 in a similar fashion to the needle cover 52 fitting into aperture 51. By this means, the guard 50 can be used for blood tests or the like, as well as a suitable holder for the needle cover 52. Such a needle guard can be larger than that of Figure 1, and may require a separate stand to support it in the upright position when not held in the hand. Finally, it will be appreciated that various alterations or modifications may be made to the foregoing without departing from the scope of this invention as exemplified by the following claims.
