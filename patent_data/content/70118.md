# Thermosetting powder coating compositions.

## Abstract
A linear saturated crystalline polyester comprising an acid component containing at least 40 mole per cent of terephthalic or isophthalic acid moieties and a dihydric alcohol component containing at least 40 mole per cent of 1,6 hexanediol moieties, and having a number average molecular weight of 700 to 3000, a melt viscosity of 50 3000 cP at 160 C and a hydroxyl number of 30 to 160 is very suitable for use in powder coating compositions. These compositions contain a curing agent to cross link the polyester and may contain an acid crosslinking catalyst.
