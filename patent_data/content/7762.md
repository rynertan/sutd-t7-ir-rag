# Apparatus and method for encapsulating electronic components in hardenable plastics.

## Abstract
Apparatus for encapsulating portions of objects in plas tics comprises upper and lower mold plates 21, 22 . The upper plate 21 has an injection opening communicating with feed runners 57, 58 . In particular to reduce down time, a cavity plate 20 is removably positionable between the mold plates 21, 22 and has openings 38, 39 and holds objects spaced from the upper mold plate 21 . The feed runners 58 communicate with the openings 38, 39 directly, or in an alternative by way of gates. In operation, the cavity plate 20 is loaded with objects to be encapsulated, inserted between the mold plates 21, 22 and fluid plastics forced through the injection opening, runners 57, 58 and gates if provided into the openings, 38, 39 to encapsulate the objects.
