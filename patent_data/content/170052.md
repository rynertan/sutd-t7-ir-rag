## Description
The Present invention relates to a master slice type semiconductor circuit device. More particularly, it relates to a gate array type large scale integrated circuit device gate array LSI made of a master slice type semiconductor circuit device. The gate array LSI according to the present invention includes a logic block consisting of a plurality of basic gate circuit cells and memory circuits each consisting of a plurality of memory cells. A master slice type semiconductor circuit device is designed to facilitate short run production meeting diverse customer requirements and is utilized, for example, for gate array LSI s. In the master slice method, a set of common processes until diffusion is used to manufacture a master substrate for use in forming what will later be a variety of semiconductor devices. The master substrate is basically constituted by a plurality of basic cells, each cell consisting of transistors. The gate electrodes, sources, and drains of the transistors are uniformly formed on the master substrate. No wiring between the basic cells is yet performed. In the succeeding slice process, wiring is performed on the master substrate by using a wiring mask pattern. The wiring mask pattern is designed by a computer aided design CAD system to meet customer requirements. In a gate array LSI, the basic cells, each consisting of a basic circuit, are arranged in a grid. The wiring between the basic cells is also designed by computer according to the logic circuit required by the customer. Recently, however, it has been proposed to provide specific memory blocks to a gate array LSI in addition to logic blocks. There are many problems with such a gate array LSI. First, there is limited flexibility of design since the capacity and circuit arrangement of such a memory circuit are previously set and cannot be changed to meet customer requirements. Second, the wiring area is not effectively utilized, which obstructs miniaturization. To obtain a highly integrated gate array, it is important to minimize the wiring area and shorten the wiring length. ISSCC Digest of technical papers, February 1983, pages 146 147, Toshi Sano et al.

ISSCC Digest of technical papers, February 1984, pages 258 259, 348, M. TAKECHI et al. A CMOS 12K gate array with flexible 10Kb memory discloses merely a structure of two layers metallized pattern wired to obtain a minimum wiring resistance. The primary object of the present invention is to provide a master slice type semiconductor circuit device facilitating design to customer requirements. Another object of the present invention is to provide an improved gate array LSI using a master slice type semiconductor circuit device having a logic block consisting of a plurality of basic gate circuit cells and memory circuits each consisting of a plurality of memory cells. Still another object of the present invention is to provide a method for clipping input terminals of the memory circuit in the gate array LSI in accordance with customer requirements. According to the invention, these objects have been solved by the features of claim 1. In the figures In the master slice type semiconductor circuit device according to the present invention, power source lines for clipping are formed in the same process as the gate electrode of the transister, i.e., are previously and uniformly formed on the master substrate. Accordingly, as explained in detail hereinafter, it is possible to easily obtain the wiring pattern and memory capacity or function required by a customer by just determining the position of contact holes. A gate array LSI formed by the master slice method according to the present invention will be explained in detail hereinafter. Figure 1 is a schematic view of the gate array LSI device on a semiconductor chip according to an embodiment of the present invention. In Fig. 1, reference numerals 1 and 2 represent memory circuits, each consisting of a random access memory RAM or read only memory ROM . These memory circuits 1 and 2 constitute a memory block. Reference numerals 5 represent basic cells. A plurality of these basic cells arranged in a grid constitutes a logic block. An input output buffer circuit 6 is provided to the peripheral portion of these logic and memory blocks. Power lines V Reference numerals 7, 8, 9, and 10 are power source lines provided to each of the basic cells in the logic block. These power source lines are connected to the supply source pads through the power lines V Reference numerals 11 and 12 are also power source lines, but these lines are formed by a gate conductive layer disposed under the first conductive layer. The gate conductive layer is also used to form the gate electrode of the transistor of the basic cell. These lines 11 and 12 are disposed under the first conductive layer through the insulation layer and connected to the power lines V In the above mentioned structure, the wiring between the basic cells in the logic block and between the logic block and the memory block is determined by computer aided design CAD system based on the logic circuit required by the customer. In this case, the selected input terminals of an input portion of each memory circuit are clipped to the predetermined first or second logic level in correspondence with the memory capacity required. That is, a potential of the selected input terminal is equal to the predetermined first or second logic level. Clip means to set the selected input terminal of the memory circuit to the predetermined first or second logic level by using a contact hole as contact means, as explained in detail hereinafter. Accordingly, the clipped input terminals are no longer used as input terminals of the input portion in the memory circuit, and the memory areas connected to the clipped input terminals are no longer used as memory areas. In Fig. 1, four clipped points CP are shown on the line 12 in the memory circuit 1 and four on the line 12 in the memory 2. In this case, these eight selected input terminals are clipped to the source voltage V Figure 2A is an enlarged view of input terminals and power source lines. In Fig. 2A, reference numerals 13, 14, and 14 represent input terminals provided to the memory circuit 1 or 2. The input terminal 13 is clipped to the power source line 12 at the contact hole 13a, and the input terminal 14 is clipped to the power source line 11 at the contact hole 14a. The input terminal 14 is not clipped and is thus connected to the wiring 14 through the contact hole 14a . This wiring 14 is connected to the basic cell in the logic block. As explained above, the input terminals 13, 14, and 14 are formed by aluminum wiring of the first conductive layer, and the wiring 14 is formed by the aluminum wiring of the second conductive layer. The power source lines 11 and 12 are formed by the gate conductive layer. Accordingly, the contact holes 13a and 14a are used for connecting the first conductive layer and the gate conductive layer, and the contact hole 14a is used for connecting the first conductive layer and the second conductive layer. Figure 2B is a sectional view of the input terminal 14 taken along line A A in Fig. 2A. As obvious from the drawing, the input terminal 14 is connected clipped to the power source line 11 through the contact hole 14a. The input terminal 13 has the same sectional view as the input terminal 14. Figure 2C is a sectional view of the input terminal 14 taken along line B B in Fig. 2A. In this case, the input terminal 14 is not connected to either the power source line 11 or 12. The input terminal 14 is connected to the wiring 14 through the contact hole 14a . Figure 2D is a schematic plan and sectional view of the power source lines 11 and 12 formed by the gate conductive layer shown in Fig. 2A. These power source lines 11 and 12 are formed in advance in the master slice method, i.e., are formed by the same process as the gate conductive layer of the gate electrode of the transistor. Figure 3 is a detailed partial view of the memory circuit shown in Fig. 1. In Fig. 3, the memory circuit 1 includes a memory cell array constituted by a plurality of memory cells MC , each of which is connected to a word line WL and a bit line BL in case of a dual port type memory cell, a pair of word and bit lines are used , a sense amplifier group 16 constituted by a plurality of sense amplifiers used for reading data, a write amplifier group 17 constituted by a plurality of write amplifiers used for writing data, a word address register group 18 constituted by a plurality of word address registers, a word decoder group 19 constituted by a plurality of word decoders, and a control circuit 20. Reference numerals 11 and 12 are power source lines each of which is made of, for example, polycrystalline silicon, as explained above. These power source lines 11 and 12, as first and second conductive lines, are connected to main power lines V Reference character A represent an address signal, B write data, C read data, and D a control signal having the clock signal and the write enable signal. The address signal A is input to the word address register group 18, the write data B is input to the write amplifier group 17, and the read data C is output from the sense amplifier group 16. The control signal D is input to the control circuit. In Fig. 3, points P₁ , P₂ , and P₃ are clipped to the power source line 12. That is, the second logic level of these points P₁ , P₂ , and P₃ is set to V Figure 4 is a schematic view for explaining used and unused memory areas. Assuming that the memory circuit 1 includes 64 word, 10 bit memory cells, the word address signal A comprises 6 bits A₁ to A₆ and each of the sense and write amplifier groups 16 and 17 comprises 10 units. In this case, assuming that the memory capacity required by the customer is 32 words and 8 bits, the word address signal A must be 5 bits and each of the sense and write amplifiers groups 16 and 17 must be 8 units. That is, the most significant bit MSB A₁ of the address signal A is set to 0 , and the memory area to be used is determined by the most significant bit A₁. Accordingly, when the most significant bit A₁ is 0 , the memory area shown by the hatched lines is not used as a memory area. Also, one bit portion of the address register group 18 shown by the hatched lines and two bit portions of the write amplifier group 17 shown by the hatched lines are not used in this case. As can be understood, the remaining input terminals are used for the logic operation. The output terminals corresponding to the clipped input terminals need not be clipped and may remain as open terminals because no output signals are given to such unused output terminals. Moreover, it is possible to select the clipping point of the input terminal in accordance with wiring space conditions. For example, the two cross hatched portions of the write amplifier group 17 correspond to the clipped input terminals. These write amplifiers are not used for the logic operation. The address signals A₂ to A₆ are used for designating an address in the used memory area. LSB is the lowest significant bit. Figure 5 is a schematic view of a gate array LSI device on a semiconductor chip according to another embodiment of the present invention. In Fig. 5, reference numerals the same as in Fig. 1 represent the same elements. Reference numerals 3 and 4 represent basic cell rows. Each of the basic cell rows 3 and 4 is provided to each memory circuit 1 and 2 and is used for clipping and as an input portion of an additional circuit element. For example, the hatched portions 3a and 4a of the basic cell rows 3 and 4 are used for clipping, and the other portions non hatched portions are used as input circuits. That is, the basic cells in the logic block are used as first basic cells, and the basic cell rows 3 and 4 are used as second basic cells. Each of the second basic cells has the same structure as the first one. In the hatched basic cells, the input terminals of basic cells are connected clipped to the power source line 36 or 37 which is formed by the first conductive layer, for example, polycrystalline silicon. These lines 36 and 37 are connected to the lines 11 and 12 of the second conductive layer through the contact holes P, shown in Fig. 6. Figure 6 is a detailed partial view of the memory circuit shown in Fig. 5. In Fig. 6, reference numerals the same as in Fig. 3 represent the same elements. As explained above, the hatched portions of the basic cell row 3 are clipped to the power source lines 36 and 37 in accordance with customer requirements. The same explanations as given for Figs. 3 and 4 regarding used and unused memory areas apply to Fig. 6. Incidentally, power source lines V Figure 7A is a schematic plan view of the structure of the basic cell and the wiring Fig. 7B is a sectional view of the basic cell taken along line D D shown in Fig. 7A and Fig. 7C is a basic circuit of the basic cell shown in Fig. 7A. In Fig. 7A, reference character L represents an area of one basic cell of the basic cell rows. P channel and N channel transistors are used as the basic cells in the area L. In the P channel transistor area, the transistor area is formed by P type diffusion layer portions 23, 24, and 25 on the N type semiconductor substrate 22. Reference numerals 26 and 27 represent gate conductive layer portions consisting of, for example, polycrystalline silicon, each forming gate electrodes. These gate conductive layer portions 26 and 27 also form the gate electrodes of the N channel transistor. Reference numerals 28 and 29 represent N type substrate contact areas connected to the semiconductor substrate 22. In the N channel transistor area, the transistor area is formed by N type diffusion layer portions 31, 32, and 33 and P type substrate contact areas 34 and 35, these diffusion layer portions and substrate contact areas being formed on the P type well 30. A sectional view of the N channel transistor area taken along line D D is given in Fig. 7B. In Fig. 7B, reference characters IS represent the insulation layers. Power source lines 36 and 37 consisting of, for example, polycrystalline silicon are provided transversely above each of the gate conductive layer portions 26 and 27 through an insulation layer. The power source line 36 is used for supplying source voltage V Figure 7D is a sectional view of the gate conductive layer and the N type substrate contact area 28 taken along line C C in Fig. 7A. As obvious from the drawing, since the gate conductive layer portion 26 is connected to the N type substrate contact area 28 through the aluminum wiring 46 and the N type substrate contact area 28 is connected to the power source line 36, the input terminal or the inverter having a common gate conductive layer portion 26 with the gate electrode is clipped to the source voltage V As can be understood, it is possible to clip the selected input terminal of the basic cell into a predetermined first or second logic level in a short length of wiring by using this method. Consideration has been given to clip the power source line 36 to the gate conductive layer portion 26 at the area T₁ instead of the wiring 46 and to clip the power source line 37 to the gate conductive layer portion 27 at the area T₂ instead of the wiring 47. This turns out to be difficult, however, because the layer portions 26 and 27 are very narrow and thin and, moreover, the gate insulation layer provided under the conductive layer is very narrow and thin. If the gate conductive layer portions 26 and 27 are made wider so as to enable provision of a contact hole, the logic characteristic of the inverter conversely deteriorates. Therefore, it is technically difficult to directly provide a contact hole at the area T₁ and T₂ to these gate conductive layer portions 26 and 27. Figure 8 is a schematic wiring view of the basic cell rows shown in Figs. 5 and 6. In Fig. 8, reference letters L₁ , L₂ , and L₃ indicate elements corresponding to the basic cell area L shown in Fig. 7A. In this case, the basic cell area L₁ is used as the CMIS inverter, the basic cell area L₂ is used as a basic cell in which the input terminal is clipped to the source voltage V Figure 9 is a schematic view of a gate array LSI device on a semiconductor chip according to still another embodiment of the present invention. In Fig. 9, reference numerals the same as in Figs. 1 and 5 represent the same elements. Reference numerals 5a and 5b hatched portions represent stacked gates. In this embodiment, any basic cell or cells may be used as a so called stacked gate for clipping. This stacked gate is connected clipped to the input terminal of the memory block at the clipping point CP. In general, a stacked gate is a basic cell with an output terminal connected to a power source line so that the predetermined potential is output therefrom. As shown in Fig. 9, the basic cell rows 3 and 4 shown in Fig. 5 can be eliminated and the stacked gates connected to the input terminals of the memory block. These input terminals are connected to each other. Moreover, alternatively, each stacked gate can be directly connected to a specific pattern not shown of the memory block. Figure 10A is a schematic plan view of the structure of the stacked gate shown in Fig. 9, and Fig. 10B is a sectional view of the stacked gate taken along line E E in Fig. 10A. In Fig. 10A, the power source line V As obvious from Fig. 10B, the power source line V Figure 11 is a schematic block diagram of the word address register group 18 shown in Figs. 3, 4, and 6. In Fig. 11, the inverter 48 hatched line is used as the input buffer and, for example, is formed by the basic cell shown in Fig. 8, in the case of the second embodiment. However, in the case of the first embodiment, the inverter 48 is provided to the register group 18. The address register section 49 connected to the inverter 48 is constituted by a plurality of transfer gates 52, 53, flip flop circuits 50, 51, and inverters 54, 55, and 56. The section 49 is also formed by a specific pattern in the memory circuit. In Fig. 11, each of the the transfer gates 52 and 53 receives a clock signal CK or an inverted clock signal As explained above, the selected input terminal of the inverter is clipped to the power source lines V A typical complementary metal oxide semiconductor CMOS inverter is shown in Fig. 12. This inverter outputs a high or low level signal corresponding to the input address signal based on the turning on or off of the transistors T As can be understood by the above explanations, the master slice type semiconductor circuit device according to the present invention is very suitable for the design of wiring patterns by computer aided design CAD . This is because it is not necessary to prepare and previously register information of the wiring pattern of the memory circuits 1, 2 in a library of the CAD system them for every required memory structure. That is, according to the present invention, only one kind of information of the wiring pattern of the memory circuits 1 and 2 is previously registered in the library of the CAD system, and it is possible to realize the required memory structure by only supplying position information of the contact hole to the CAD system.
