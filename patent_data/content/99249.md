# Active clinchers and wire stitchers incorporating same.

## Abstract
An active clincher 201 has a housing 202 forming a support surface 203 for an article, such as a set of sheets, to be stapled. One or a pair of clincher ears 204 is positively driven by an actuator 223 for bending over the staple leg s to form clinches. The clincher ears 204 are pivotally mounted on the housing 202 and rotatable by the actuator 223 so as to engage and bend the staple legs. The or each clincher ear 204 is mounted, suitably by having a slotted pivot hole 212, so that it also moves normally to the support surface during and or following the end part of the rotational movement of the ear.
