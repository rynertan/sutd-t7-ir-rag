## Description
A system for playingback a programme of consecutive film frames intended to be viewed at a rate of n film frames per second, which system comprises a disc shaped record carrier with a substantially spiral shaped or concentric ring shaped information track in which the programme has be recorded as an alternatively sequence of odd and even fields, the number of fields per turn being equal to two, the beginnings of the odd and even fields being in alignment in a first and second radial direction respectively, the nominal play back speed of the record carrier being m video pictures per second with m n, the system further comprises a read apparatus for scanning the record carrier in order to read out the video signal, which read apparatus is provided with means for moving the scanning part in radial direction in order to perform backwards and forwards jumps over an even number of fields. The invention also relates to a read apparatus and a record carrier for use in a system in accordance with the invention. Such a system is described in Netherlands Patent Application no.7702874 PHN.8717 . The said record carriers are primarily intended to be provided with a programme by the factory and thus to be made available to the consumer as prerecorded record carriers. The most likely programme material for this type of prerecorded record carriers is constituted by film material because this is available in large quantities and in a wide repertory. If a film programme is to be used for the manufacture of record carriers destined for, for example, the American market, a complication results from the difference between the standards for the reproduction of film images and those for the reproduction of television pictures. The standards mainly used for film In the still picture mode the scanning spot is moved back radially by one track pitch after every revolution of the record carrier with the aid of deflection means, so that continually the same turn of the spiral track is scanned. As exactly two fields are recorded in one turn of the track, which fields together constitute an interlaced television image, one specific picture of the recorded television signal is reproduced continuously in this still picture mode. If a read apparatus for disc shaped record carriers operates in the still picture mode it is found that the reproduction quality is not always satisfactory when record carriers are used on which a television programme is recorded which is obtained in the manner described above. Often the television picture which is reproduced in the still picture mode exhibits blurring and in the case of certain programmes it is even completely unacceptable. This is because alternately two and three fields per film frame are recorded, so that there are turns which contain two fields which belong to different film frames and which are reproduced alternately in the still picture mode. Therefore it has been proposed in the above Netherlands Patent Application 7702874 PHN.8717 to assign a picture number to one specific field of a set of two fields corresponding to the same film frame and to construct the read apparatus in such a manner that only these two fields identified by this picture number can be reproduced in the still picture mode. As a result of this, a turn containing two fields of different pictures cannot be reproduced in the still picture mode. However, as a result of this, the picture numbers of the consecutive pictures on the disc will be situated on two radii of the turn which are 180 The invention aims at providing a system of the type specified in the opening paragraph and a read apparatus and a record carrier for use in this system, which allows still picture reproducing on every turn and which allows the picture numbers to be recorded in every turn and on the one radius without the disadvantage of repeating picture information at the expense of the playing time. To this end the system in accordance with the invention is characterised in that for each film frame only one video picture composed of an odd and even field has been recorded, in that the read apparatus is provided with means 8,15 for initiating forward and backwards jumps in conformity with a predetermined pattern, such that n film frames per second are reproduced as an alternatively sequence of odd and even fields and that consecutive film frames are reproduced as consecutive sets of two or more fields, each set comprising at least the two fields of the video picture of the corresponding film frame. In particular in the above situation of a film comprising 24 frames per second and a television standard of 30 pictures per second, the invention may be characterised further in that In another embodiment this system is characterised further in that in said cycle of four film frames, corresponding to ten reproduced fields, a backward jump over two fields is effected after every fourth and every sixth field and a forward jump over two fields is effected after every fifth field. An alternative requiring more jumps is characterised in that in said cycle of four film frames, corresponding to ten reproduced fields, a backward jump over two fields is effected after every fourth, every sixth and every eighth field and a forward jump over two fields is effected after every fifth and every seventh field. The invention will now be described in more detail, by way of example, with reference to the drawings, in which Fig. 1 shows an apparatus for reading a rotating optically readable record carrier 1. Reading is effected by projecting a light beam emitted by a laser 2 onto said record carrier The signal obtained by means of the detector 6 is applied to a processing circuit 8 on whose output 17 the recovered video signal is available. Further, the apparatus comprises a jump signal generator 13 which under command of signals on its inputs 20 and 21 respectively generates a jump signal in order to move the spot formed by the read beam forwards or backwards over one turn of the track. This jump signal on output 24 is applied to the motor 7 In a manner known It often happens that the picture material is available in the form of films, which gives rise to problems when transfering these films onto video discs because of the different framing standards. The standard mainly used for films implies A solution which readily enables still pictures to be obtained on every turn and which enables the picture numbers to be inserted on one radius, which solution also has the advantage that the playing time is extended, will be described with reference to Figs. 2 and 3. In accordance with this solution the reproduction sequence is realized electronically with two and three fields per film frame in a specific sequence, the sequence two three two three being described with reference to Figs. 2 and the sequence two three three two being described with reference to Fig. 3. In Fig. 2 a part of the developed spiral track 25 of a record carrier is shown schematically containing four consecutive film frames each comprising only two fields The line 26 represents schematically the normal playback operation, the solid line denoting playback and the broken line denoting a jump in the present example over one turn of a track of two fields . The operation starts with the reproduction of the first four fields 1a, 1b, 2a and 2b followed by a backward jump. Subsequently, field 2a is reproduced again, followed by a forward jump after which field 3b is reproduced. This is followed by a backward jump, after which field 3a is reproduced, followed by a forward jump. Subsequently, field 4b is reproduced upon which, after a backward jump, the cycle is completed with the reproduction of fields 4a and 4b. The reference numeral 27 denotes the field sequence actually reproduced in Fig. 2. Thus, ten fields for every four film frames are reproduced in a sequence two three two three and alternately a field Fig. 3 shows essentially the same diagram as Fig. 2, the reference numerals 31, 32, 33, 34, 35 and 36 in Fig. 3 corresponding to the reference numerals 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 and 30, respectively in Fig. 2. The difference is that a backward jump is initiated only upon every fifth and seventh field synchronizing pulse and a forward jump upon the sixth field synchronizing pulse, so that the reproduction sequence two three three two is obtained. The electronic standard adaptation described may also be employed in other situations, in particular to obtain a playing time extension. For example, in the case of animated film specific recurrent patterns are used within the film frames themselves in order to reduce the number of pictures per second to be actually drawn. In this case it is required only to record the mutually different film frames and to reproduce them repeatedly by electronic means, which only requires backward jumps to repeat the frames, as the case may be in conjunction with the 24 to 30 frames per second standard adaptation described in the foregoing. It is then even possible to record film frames in conformity with different standards, to identify the various frames in a picture code or index at the beginning of the disc, and to programme the player with respect to the reproduction sequence of the various frames. The counter 15 in the apparatus shown in Fig. 1 is then programmable, for example by means of a microprocessor. Since in the reproduction method described above fields are repeated, conventional sound recording and reproduction is not possible. Compression expansion or multiplexing techniques may then provide a solution. For example, it is possible to employ two FM sound carriers for each stereo channel, one carrier wave for the sound to be reproduced during the first reproduction of a specific field and one for the reproduction of the sound during the repeated scan of said field, in a sequence in conformity with the reproduction diagram shown in Fig. 2 or 3. The above method always employs one forward or backward jump at a time. However, in the system in accordance with the invention it is also possible to effect recording in such a way that for a correct reproduction jumps over several turns of a track are required, in particular when a plurality of film frames have been recorded in parallel in tracks disposed between one another. Further, the scope of the invention is not limited to the use in optical video discs. Other methods of recording may also be used.
