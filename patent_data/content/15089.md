# Method and apparatus for use in charging a crucible having a refractory wall with a bar of metal.

## Abstract
In inserting a bar 12 of metal into a refractory crucible 10 of a conventional vacuum furnace, a covering 23 is placed over the leading end 22 of the bar 12 to reduce ring of the crucible 10 and the production of chips or particles of refractory material. The covering 23 is softer than the refractory crucible 10 and has shock absorbing properties. The covering 23 is disintegrated upon heating of the bar 12 and turns into constituent components which have no adverse effect on the chemical composition of the molten meta to be poured from the crucible 10 . In the preferred practice, the covering is a preformed boot 23 which fits the leading end 22 of the bar 12 and is formed of an expanded unsaturated aliphathic or substituted aliphatic hydrocarbon polymer such as expanded polyethylene.
