# Container for liquids.

## Abstract
A container for fluids, for instance liquids comprising a container part having end closures at opposite ends of the container part. In each cross section of the container part perpendicu lar to an axis through centres of the end closures of the con tainer, there are four sides where at least pairs of sides are of the same length and the sides are interconnected along first folding denotations parallel to said axis along the entire length of the container part. In each end closure there are second folding denota tions defining sub panels, which are geometrically placed such that the container part and the end closures are com pressible to a plane state and expandable to a cross section where said cross section sides form an opening angle cor responding to the desired filling volume of the container. For forming a container structure basically capable of being compressed and expanded, respectively, without cre ating strains in the structure and without a major displace ment of the contaimer ends, the second set of folding deno tations comprises denotations defining a first and second triangular sub panel portion at the end of each side wall of the container part, where each first triangular portion has a base that coincides with a cross section side and is of a length substantially equal to the length of the cross section side, and each second triangular portion forms at least part of a pointed extension of the container part.
