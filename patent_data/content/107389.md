# Improved zeolite L catalyst for reforming.

## Abstract
An improved reforming catalyst employing a zeolite L sup port is provided by soaking the zeolite L in an alkali solution having a pH of at least 11 for a time and at a temperature effective to increase the period of time over which the catalytic activity of the catalyst is maintained.
