# An ink jet printer, a method of shutting down the same, a method of controlling the flow of ink to the same, and an ink supply system for the same.

## Abstract
An ink jet printer includes an ink supply system for supply ing ink through the print head 10 of the printer. The fluid sup ply system includes a pump arrangement 22 supplying ink to the print head 10 from a supply tank 16 via a fluid supply line 56 . A plurality of ink return lines 40, 42, 44 are connected between the pump outlet 26 and the pump inlet 24 . Each of the ink return lines includes a flow restriction 46, 48, 50 , with the flow restriction in each line providing a fluid flow imped ance which differs from the impedances provided by the other flow restrictions. A valve arrangement 52, 54 connects the pump outlet 26 to selected ones of the ink return lines, to provide means for controlling the flow rate of ink supplied through the ink supply line 56 to the print head 10 . During periods in which the printer is shut down, a substantially re duced ink flow through the print head is continuously main tained at a reduced fluid flow rate and at a reduced fluid pres sure.
