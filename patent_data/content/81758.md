# System for stabilizing idling of vehicular engine.

## Abstract
A vehicular power steering system has on off control means for controlling a hydraulic fluid pump in accordance with steering effort applied on a steering wheel. On the other hand, sensing means senses vehicle speed. Judging means is connected with the on off control means and the vehicle speed sensing means, and produces an actuating signal when the control means produces a control signal to drive the fluid pump and at the same time the sensed vehicle speed is below a predetermined speed A solenoid valve is connected with the judging means. The solenoid valve is arranged to open and close a bypass passage which allows an air fuel mixture to bypass a throttle valve for an intake air flow control of the engine. Thus, the supply of an air fuel mixture to the engine is increased in response to the actuat ing signal, and the engine idling speed is stabilized.
