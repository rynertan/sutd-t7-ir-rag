# Crosslinkable chemical formulation and composite semipermeable membrane made therewith.

## Abstract
A Composite semipermeable membrane comprises a a flexible film of microporous polytetrafluoroethylene or other hydrophobic material having a water vapour transmission rate in excess of 10,000 g m² 24 hours, preferably above 100,000 g m² 24 hours, and an advancing water contact angle exceeding 90 degrees, and b a continuous. crosslinked amorphous hydrophilic layer preferably of polyoxyethylene polythioether penetrated to an extent into the face of the hydrophobic layer. The hydrophilic layer provides a composite membrane having a water vapour transmission rate of the complete ensemble comparable to or even exceeding that of the hydrophobic material alone, and simultaneously offering two mechan isms of separation that imposed by the microporous hydrophobic material and that imposed by the hydrophilic layer, and as such is capable of numerous separation operations. The crosslinkable and crosslinked hydrophilic polyoxyethylene polythioether materials are new chemical formulations.
