# A method of driving the impeller of a liquid pump.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method of driving the impeller 5 of a liquid pump by means of a brushless a.c. motor 2 to which energy is supplied from a regulatable static inverter 6 operating at a frequency of 100 1000 Hz. The cavitation state of the impeller is sensed to set the inverter frequency at a value preventing cavitation. The inverter further relates to a pump for carrying out the method.
