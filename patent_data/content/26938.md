# Control of activated sludge wastewater treating process for enhanced phosphorus removal.

## Abstract
An improved method of operating an activated bio mass process wherein influent and activated biomass are initially contacted under anaerobic conditions to form a mixed liquor, the mixed liquor is subsequently oxygenated, thereafter activated biomass is separated from the mixed li quor and at least a portion of the separated biomass is in troduced into the initial contacting step. The improved method comprises maintaining both the F M ratio and the BOD P ratio within particular ranges, preferably relative to each other. F is the total mass of soluble BOD₅ exclusive of ammoniacal BOD introduced into the process system per 24 hour day, expressed as milligrams per day. M is the total weight of volatile suspended solids VSS in mg in the process system. P is the influent soluble phosphate expressed as phosphorous mg P 1 and BOD is the in fluent soluble BOD₅ mg soluble BOD 1 .
