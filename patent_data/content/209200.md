# High pressure gas discharge lamp.

## Abstract
The high pressure gas discharge lamp according to the invention has electrodes comprising a rod 24 of mainly tungsten and a helical winding 26 of mainly tungsten near the tip 25 of the rod 24 . The winding 26 has a first layer of turns 27, 37 , which is integral with a second layer of turns 28, 38 . The turns 38 are wound with torsion in the wire and surround turns 37 which are also wound with tor sion. The direction of the torsion in a turn 37, 38 is equal to the direction in which the turn 37, 38 extends around the rod 24 . As a result, these turns 37, 38 surround with tight fit their substrate 24 and 24, 37, respectively and the wind ing 26 is fixed.
