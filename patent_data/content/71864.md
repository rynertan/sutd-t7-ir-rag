## Description
This invention relates to a device for supplying automatically to any machining line, for example a size cutting machine, a stack of panels, even if they are very thin and flexible, removing them from a feeding station where said panels are piled on a lifting table. Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings shows diagrammatically in side elevational view a pile P of panels of the specified nature. This Figure evidences that, due to the non uniform thickness of the panels and due to non uniform surface tensions generated in the panels during or after their manufacture, the top panels of the pile P will have an undulated configuration. In order to feed stacks of such panels to a machining table, devices are now used which operate by a shaving action on the top of the pile, but which require a manual conditioning of the pile upon each operative cycle thereof.The stack of panels to be removed from the top of the pile is spaced from the remaining lower portion of the pile by inserting into the pile suitable wedge shaped tools which are sometimes provided with sliding rollers. If the supply of panels is to be completely automatic, suction feeders are used which pick up the panels, one by one, from the top of the pile and form a stack in a stand by station, taking advantage generally of the machining time required for the stack of panels fed in the preceding step. These devices require an additional station, i.e.the mentioned stand by station, which requires an additional floor space substantially equivalent to that of the lifting table which supports the pile of panels. The object of this invention is to overcome the drawbacks and limitations resulting from the known devices just mentioned above, by providing a device which is adapted to transfer, by a single operative step, a stack of panels from the top of the pile to any support table facing said pile without requiring either any manual action on the pile or any larger floor space for the apparatus to which the device is associated. The above and other features of the invention, and the advantages resulting therefrom, will be apparent from the following detailed description of a preferred embodiment thereof, shown in the Figures of the accompanying drawings where Figure 1 shows a pile of panels in side elevational view Figure 2 is a side elevational view of the device according to the invention, with some parts broken away Figure 3 is a diagrammatic top plan view of the two main components of the device, in the operative relationship with the pile of panels Figure 4 shows the effect of the press or means of the device on the pile of panels, the pile being shown in elevational view from the front side facing the machining line to which the stacks of panels are to be transferred Figures 5, 6 and 7 are side elevational views of the two main components of the device, in three operative positions with respect to the pile of panels, respectively Figure 8 shows further constructional details of the device, sectioned along line Vill Vill of Figure 2. In Figure 2 it can be seen that the device according to the invention comprises a carriage 1 that, by suitable actuating means not shown can be caused to slide reciprocatingly on a horizontal rectilinear guide 2 supported overhead by suitable supports and of such a length and positioned so as to permit the carriage to reciprocate between the pile of panels which is supported on a lifting table and a receiving station of the machining line to which a stack of said panels is to be transferred. The carriage 1 fixedly carries therebelow a structure 3 to which there is pivotably mounted at 4 an end of an arm 5 which is actuated by a fluid operated jack 6. The body of the jack 6 is pivoted at 7 to the carriage, and the rod thereof is pivoted at 8 to a support 9 which is fixed to an intermediate portion of said arm 5.By means of the jack 6 and with the aid of abutments not shown , the arm 5 can be moved to, and maintained in the positions shown in figure 2 either with solid line or with dot and dash line.To the outer end of the arm 5 there is fixed plate 10 strengthened by gussets 110, and a slide It can move upwards and downwards thereon, the extent of this movement being controlled by a screw 12. To the slide 11 there is fixed the body of a jack 13 of comparatively large diametre, which is directed downwards and is provided with a presser plate 14. When the arm is in the position shown with solid lines in Figure 2, the presser plate 14 is positioned horizontally. The arm 5 is formed by a pair of identical parallel plates 105 205 which are positioned edgewise and are fixed to each other by said plate 10 and by members 16 and an intermediate cross member 17. To the elements 17 and 10 there are fixed the ends of a rod 18 located longitudinally intermediate the space existing between the plates 105 205 and on an imaginary plane parallel to that of the presser member 14. Slidably mounted on the rod 18 are bushings 19 to the lower side of which there is fixed a tubular member 20 having a tapered end 120 and provided at the other end with lugs 21 to which there is fixed by means of screws one end of a wedge member 22 of suitable angth. The top surface 122 of the wedge 22 is parallel to the undersurface of the presser plate 14, and as shown in Figure 3 said wedge is characterized in that, in top plan view, it has a pointed free end.Moreover, it is to be noted that said wedge 22 is made of any material having high resistance to mechanical stresses, and that its surfaces are highly polished, fro example chrome plated, so as to afford a low coefficient of friction. Finally, it can be seen in Figure 8 that the longitudinally inclined lower surface 222 of the wedge 22 is of transverse convex configuration to reduce the surface contact with the panels upon the introduction into the pile, whereby to facilitate said introduction. In order to avoid any damage to the panels, the side edges 322, 322 of the wedge are suitably rounded. The longitudinal central axis of the wedge 22 lies on the same imaginary vertical plane as the axis of the rod of said jack 13. Moreover, as it can be seen from Figure 3, the wedge 22 presents a transverse width at least equal to the diameter of the presser member 14. The just described assembly 19 20 22 can be reciprocated linearly by a fluid operated double acting jack 23, the body of which is pivoted at 24 to the plates 105 205 and the stem of which is fixed at 25 to an Shaped member 26 wich is integral with the bushing 19. When the device is at rest, the jack 23 is extended so that the wedge 22 is retracted below the arm 5. The jacks 6, 12 and 23 are connected to a pressurized fluid source through interposed solenoid valves controlled by sensor and or programming means, the general arrangement being such as to afford an automatic operation of the device as follows At the beginning of the operative cycle, the device is in the condition shown with solid lines in Figure 2 and in the corresponding condition of Figure 3, with the arm 5 slightly inclined downwards and the plate 14 above the pile of panels P and at the centre of the side of the pile facing the machining table to which the stacks of panels are to be cyclically transferred. The rod of the jack 13 is retracted.The operative cycle of the device of the invention comprises the lifting of the support lifting table until the top of the pile P will contact the presser plate 14 and the arm 5 and associated parts will be in the horizontal position shown with small dashes lines in Figure 2. Upon reaching this condition, the lifting table will stop automatically. The portion of the pile P contacting the presser plate 14 will be subjected to the weight of the device and, therefore, will be compressed and brought into a planar condition. Thus, a portion A of said pile, having a pre established thickness as indicated at B in Figure 6 and herein called stacks, will be defined by being comprised between the plate 14 and the top surface of the wedge 22. When the lifting table stops, the jack 23 is rectracted and, therefore, the wedge 22 is introducted into the pile. InFigure 7, showing this operative step, it can be seen that the side of the pile P, which is opposed to that penetrated by the wedge 22, is abutting against a structure 27 holding the panels in the correct position, against the force exerted thereon by the wedge. During the operative movement of the wedge 22, due to the inclination of the lower surface thereof, the arm 5 is pushed slightly upwards, and the latter movement will be permitted by the fact that now the jack 6 is not being fed. At the end of the introduction movement of the wedge 22, the jack 13 will be fed to be extended, whereby the presser plate 14 will clamp the stack of panels A which is held at the bottom by the wedge 22.Then, the movement of the carriage 1 away from the pile of panels will be performed, whereby the stack of panels A clamped between the presser plate 14 and wedge 22 will be transferred by the carriage towards the machining table. To avoid any undesired movement of the future top panels of the pile, due to the friction of the stack A against the underlying panels, suitable stop members are provided to prevent said movements. For example, two stop members could be provided, and they could be located at the sides of the device of the invention. When the stack A has been brought onto the machining table, the following steps will be duly performed lifting of the presser plate 14 by retraction of jack 13 extension of jack 23 with resulting retraction of the wedge from the lower side of the stack A retraction of jack 6 to bring the arm 5 and associated parts into the position shown with dot and dash lines in Figure 2, well above the just trasferred stack A. Thereafter, the carriage 1 can be moved again toward the pile, and the cycle will be repeated as described. When the carriage will be at the end of the stroke toward the pile P, the extension of the jack 6 will be automatically effected, whereby the arm 5 and associated parts will return to the position shown with solid lines in Figure 2 corresponding position shown in Figure 5 .The pile P is then lifted by an extent which is substantially the same as the thickness of the stack A so that a new stack of panels will be positioned above the plane of the wedge 22. It is to be understood that the above description relates to a preferred embodiment of the invention, omitting the constructional details of either the electric system and fluid operating system and various safety and programming means, since they can be all easily conceived by any person skilled in the art. It is also to be understood that many changes and modifications, especially of constructional nature, can be made to the illustrated device. For example, the transfer carriage 1 could be arranged below the arm 5 and could operate within an opening formed in the machining table. As a further modificationS if the panels are strongly undulated, the stack could be submitted to a stronger compression by the presser plate 14 by means of a suitable pressure created in the chamber of the jack 6. In this instance, as soon as the point of the wedge has penetrated into the pile, said pressure is released from the jack 6, so as to facilitate the introduction of the said wedge. These changes and modifications, which are anyway easily conceivable by those skilled in the art, are comprised within the scope of the invention as set forth above and as claimed hereinafter.
