# METHOD FOR ON LINE DECOKING OF FLAME CRACKING REACTORS

## Abstract
This invention relates to a method for on line decoking of flame cracking reactors whereby decoking is achieved without interruption of the normal operation of such reac tors and without the necessity to chance feed equipment and or disassemble reactor components. While maintaining thetemperature of the effluent at 1000 C to 2O00 C, the flow of the hydrocarbon feedstock in the reactor is periodically stopped for a time sufficient to reduce the carbon deposits to an acceptable level.
