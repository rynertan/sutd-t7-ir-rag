## Abstract
A magnetic tape drive in which a tape cartridge 20 is endwise loaded and thereafter minutely moved into a preci sion alignment position with respect to a read write head 62 . The drive has a support frame 12 with a front panel 18 and an elongate tray 14 dimensioned to have the cartridge inserted endwise thereon. The tray is supported by the frame for longitudinal sliding movement from a retracted position in which the tray is contained within the frame to an extended position in which a portion of the tray extends through a slot 16 in the front panel. A mechanism 116, 106 is provided for opening the access door 24 of the cartridge while the car tridge 20 is supported on the tray 14 and the tray is being moved from its extended position to its retracted position. Another mechanism 26 is provided for simultaneously mov ing the head 62 and a capstan drive 56 into engagement with the cartridge 20 once it has been fully inserted and for also moving clamp mechanisms 148, 150, 152 against the bottom plate 34 of the cartridge to minutely move the car tridge against adjustable reference location pins 154, 156, 158 .
