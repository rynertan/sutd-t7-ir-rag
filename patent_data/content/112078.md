## Description
A SEMICONDUCTOR MEMORY ELEMENT AND A METHOD FOR MANUFACTURING IT The present invention relates to a semiconductor memory element. More particularly, the present invention relates to the structure of a select transistor in a non volatile memory element having a two transistor cell structure comprising a memory transistor and a select transistor. An example of a memory element having a twotransistor cell structure comprises a. memory transistor of the Flotox type having a floating gate and a control gate formed by the double selfaligning technique, and a select transistor consisting of an ordinary MOS transistor. This memory element forms an electrically rewritable read only memory element and the rewriting of information into it is effected by the tunnel injection of electrons into its floating gate. In this type of memory transistor, by maintaining the control gate or the drain at a high level, for example, about 20 V, or at a low level, for example,O V, electrons are injected into or emitted from the floating gate through the tunnel gate oxide film, so that erasure or the writing of information is effected. The select transistor which acts on rewriting information into the memory transistor has a predetermined threshold voltage Vth , and it is sufficient if this transistor has an ordinary gate function. In the conventional two transistor cell structure, the select transistor is constructed from an MOS transistor having a single layer gate structure. In this case, problems due to the preparation process, such as a reduction of the performance and a reduction of the integration density, arise. According to a first aspect of this invention a semiconductor memory element having a two transistor cell structure comprising a memory transistor including a floating gate formed on a semi conductor substrate through a first insulating layer and a control gate superimposed on the floating gate above a second insulating layer, and a select transistor for selecting the memory transistor, wherein the select transistor includes a first gate electrode formed on a first insulating layer is characterised in that the select transistor also includes a second gate electrode superimposed on the first gate electrode above a second insulating layer, the first and second gate electrodes being electrically connected to one another. According to a second aspect of this invention a method of forming such a memory element comprises the steps of forming a field oxide film on a semi conductor substrate forming a first gate insulation film on an exposed surface of the semiconductor substrate forming a first conductive layer on the semiconductor substrate patterning the first conductive layer forming a second gate insulation film on the first conductive layer forming contact window on the second gate insulation film for electrically communicating the first conductive layer with a second conductive layer forming a second conductive layer on the second gate insulation film, and over the contact window to electrically connect the second and first conductive layers patterning the second conductive layer to form the control gate and another second gate removing the exposed second gate insulation film and patterning the first conductive layer to form a first gate of the select transistor and the floating gate of the memory transistor and, forming a source region and a drain region in the semi conductor substrate. The present invention provides a gate structure for the select transistor which has an ordinary gate function, but since it is arranged in parallel to the memory transistor by adopting a double self aligning technique, the shortening of the substantial gate length of the select transistor is prevented. One particular example of the method comprises the steps of forming a field oxide film on a P type silicon substrate forming a first gate oxide film o having a thickness of from about 300 A to about 1500 A on the exposed surface of the P type silicon substrate forming a first polysilicon layer having a thickness o o of from about 500 A to about 5,000 A on the first gate oxide film patterning the first polysilicon layer forming a second gate oxide film having a thickness of o o from about 300 A to about 1500 A on the first polysilicon layer forming a contact window on the second gate oxide film for electrically communicating the first polysilicon layer with a second polysilicon layer forming the second polysilicon layer having a thickness o of from about 500 A to about 5,000 A on the second gate oxide film patterning the first polysilicon layer removing the exposed second gate oxide film and patterning the second polysilicon layer for forming a gate of the select transistor, a gate of the memory transistor, and a gate of a tunnel portion and implanting ions on the exposed surface of the P type silicon substrate so that an N type source region and an N type drain region are formed. Particular embodiments of a memory element and a method in accordance with this invention will now be described and contrasted with the prior art with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a circuit diagram of a conventional two transistor cell Figure 2 is a diagrammatic section through the two transistor cell shown in Figure 1 Figures 3A and 3B are plans of the cell shown in Figure 1 Figure 4 is a diagrammatic section through the cell shown in Figure 1 illustrating problems involved in the conventional technique Figures SA and 5B are plans of one embodiment of the present invention Figure 5C is a section taken along the lineA A shown in Figure 5B Figure 5D is a section taken along the line B B shown in Figure 5B Figure 5E is a section taken along the line C C shown in Figure 5B Figure 6 is a process diagram illustrating the production process according to one embodiment of the present invention Figures 7A to 7H are step diagrams of a section taken along the line A A in Figure 5B in the embodiment illustrated in Figure 6 Figures 8A to 8J are step diagrams of a section taken along the line B B in Figure 5B in the embodiment illustrated in Figure 6 Figures 9A to 9F are step diagrams of a section taken along the line C C in Figure 5B in the embodiment illustrated in Figure 6 and, Figure 10 is a plan showing a pattern of a first polysilicon layer in the embodiment illustrated inFigure 6. Figure 1 is a circuit diagram of a two transistor cell. In Figure 1, BL designates a bit line, WL designates a word line, CG designates a control gate, Trs designates a select transistor, and Trm designates a memory transistor. Figure 2 is a principle diagram of the structure of the above mentioned Flotox type cell transistor. InFig. 2, SUB designates, for example, a P type silicon substrate, S designates an N type source region, D designates an N type drain region, FG designates a floating gate composed of polysilicon, CG designates a control gate composed of polysilicon, TG designates a tunnel gate portion, OX1 designates a first gate oxide film having a thickness of from about 300 A to about 1500 A, OX2 designates a second gate oxide film having a thickness of from about 300 A to about 1500 A, and OXt designates a tunnel gate oxide film having a thickness of from about 80 A to about 200 A. In this Flotox type cell transistor, by maintaining the control gate CG or the drain D at a high level, for example, about 20 V, or at a low level, for example, 0 V, electrons are injected into or emitted from the floating gate FG through the tunnel gate oxide film OXt, whereby the erasing of or the writing of information is effected. The select transistor Trs in Fig. 1 which acts on the rewriting of information in the memory transistor Trm in Fig. 1 has a predetermined threshold voltage Vth , and it is sufficient if this transistor has an ordinary gate function. In the conventional two transistor cell, the select transistor is constructed from an MOS transistor having a single layer gate structure. In this case, problems due to the preparation process, such as a reduction of the performance and a reduction of the integration density, arise. Figures 3A and 3B are perspective plane views illustrating a conventional memory cell in which reference numeral 1 designates an active region where a silicon surface is exposed, reference numeral 2 designates a field region where a thick oxide film is formed, PA designates a first polysilicon layer, P desigB nates a second polysilicon layer, MG designates a gate of the memory transistor Trm shown in Fig. 2 having a two layer structure, SG designates a gate of the select transistor Trs shown in Fig. 2 having a single layer structure, and TG designates a tunnel gate portion. In forming this structure, the floating gate FG shown inFig. 2 of the memory transistor Trm is aligned with the control gate CG shown in Fig. 2 by using the double self aligning technique. In Fig. 3A, first, the first gate oxide film OX1 is formed over all of the surface second, the first polysilicon layer PA is formed over all of thefirst gate oxide film OX1 third, a resist pattern having the form indicated by the hatched area is formed on the first polysilicon layer PA , and the first polysilicon layer PA is patterned by using the resist as a mask.Therefore, the first polysilicon layer PA becomes as is indicated by the hatched area in Fig. 3A. Then the second gate oxide film OX2 is formed over all of the surface, the second polysilicon layer PB is formed over all of the surface, and a resist pattern is formed on the second polysilicon layer PB as is shown by the broken lines, respectively.Next, the second polysilicon layer PB is patterned by using the resist formed on the second polysilicon layer PB After finishing the patterning of the second polysilicon layer PB , the region where the gate of the transistor T r is formed only by the second polysilicon layer PB for example, a peripheral circuit of the memory is further covered by the resist indicated by R in Fig. 3A so as to prevent unnecessary etching in the next step.Figure 3A shows a case when the resist is formed on the region where the first polysilicon layer PA does not exist. In this case, the the resist used for patterning is left on the second polysilicon layer PB. . Next, the second gate oxide film OX2, the first polysilicon layer PA, and the first gate oxide film OX1 are patterned by using the resist left on the second polysilicon layer PB as a mask so that the pattern shown in Fig. 3B is obtained. More specifically, the second polysilicon layer PB , which is directly formed on the active region through the first gate oxide film OX1 inFig. 2 in the select transistor forming region A and is formed on the polysilicon layer PA through the second gate oxide film OX2 in Fig. 2 in the memory transistor forming region B, is selectively etched, by using a predetermined mask for patterning the region B, to form the gate SG of the select transistor Trs and the control gate CG of the memory transistor Trm, which are composed of the second polysilicon layer PB. . Then the exposed second gate oxide film OX2 and the first polysilicon layer PA located below the second gate oxide film OX2 are selectively etched to form the floating gate FG composed of the first polysilicon layer PA. When the second gate oxide film OX2 and the first polysilicon layer PA are selectively etched, a concave portion, having a depth corresponding to the thickness of the polysilicon of the first layer, for example, from o, o 500 A to 5,000 A, and including a side etching portion undercut portion below the gate SG of the select transistor Trs, is formed in the active region 1 on the side of the memory transistor Trm, which cannot be covered with a resist because the gap G is narrow in the select transistor forming region A. When the source region S and drain region D of Fig. 2 are formed by using the gates SG and CG as a mask, the source region S of the select transistor is formed so that it deeply penetrates below the gate SG. This state is illustrated in Fig. 4, in which SUB designates a P type silicon substrate, S designates anN type source region, D designates an N type drain region, OX designates a gate oxide film corresponding to OX2 , SG designates a gate, PB designates the polysilicon of the second layer, and reference numeral 3 designates a concave portion. For the purpose of preventing the formation of this concave portion, the resist may be formed on the region between the gate SG and the polysilicon layer P when the polysilicon layer PB is removed. However, on that occasion, the gap G should be large, and, further, the number of processes for forming and patterning the resist should be increased. In the above mentioned structure, since the substantial gate length lg of the select transistor is shorter than the designed value and the punch through voltage of the source drain is reduced, there arises a problem of soft writing in the memory element. If the designed gate length is increased, this undesirable phenomenon is prevented from occurring, but the cell area is increased and the integration density is reduced. The embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the following drawings. Figures 5A to 5E illustrate one embodiment of the present invention. Figures 5A and SB are perspective plane views, Fig. 5C is a view of a section taken along the line A A in Fig. SB, Fig. 5D is a view of a section taken along the line B B in Fig. SB, and Fig. 5E is a view of a section taken along the line C C in Fig. 5B.Figure 6 is a process diagram illustrating one process for forming the structure of this embodiment. Figures 5A to 5E illustrate the main structure of a nonvolatile memory element of the Flotox type in which the rewriting of information is accomplished by the tunnel implantation of electrons into the floating gate and to which the present invention is applied. In Fig. 5A, the steps for forming the first polysilicon layer PA and the second polysilicon layer PB are the same as those shown in Fig. 3A except for the third step and the last step. That is, in Fig. 3A, in the third step, the first polysilicon layer PA is left only on the portion which becomes the gate of the memory transistor while in Fig. SA the first polysilicon layer PA isleft on the portion which becomes the gate of the select transistor and in Fig. 5A, in the last step, the first polysilicon layer PA, which is the same in the select transistor as in the memory transistor, is etched by using the resist left on the second polysilicon layer PB as a mask.

The characteristic feature of the present invention is that, as is shown in the above embodiment, the gate SG of the select transistor TRs is formed to have a two layer gate structure where the first polysilicon layer PA used as a substantial gate electrode is electrically connected to the second polysilicon layer PB through the contact window 4 the polysilicon layers may be connected in another region . By adopting this arrangement, when the memory element is manufactured, a concave portion penetrating below the gate SG is not formed in the active region contiguous to the gate SG of the select transistor, that is, the drain region. Of course, the method for contacting PA and PB is not limited to the above mentioned method.For example, there may be adopted a method in which PA and PB are connected to each other by an Al line through an ordinary contact hole. An embodiment of the process for preparing the structure of the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the following drawings. Figure 6 is a process diagram, Figs. 7A to 7H are views of a section taken along the line A A in Fig. SB and illustrate the process steps, Figs. 8A to 8J are views of a section taken along the line B B in Fig. 5B and illustrate the process steps, Figs. 9A to 9F are views of a section taken along the line C C in Fig. 5B and illustrate the process steps, and Fig. 10 is a plane view of a lower polysilicon pattern.

In the production of a memory element having the structure of the above embodiment, the operation is conducted, for example, according to the process diagram of Fig. 6. In Fig. 6, the steps for forming the resist are not shown. In step I, a field oxide film OXf is formed on aP type Si substrate SUB by ordinary selective oxidation.In step II, a first gate oxide film OXI having a o o thickness of from about 300 A to about 1500 A is formed on the exposed surface of the substrate according to the thermal oxidation method. This state is shown inFig. 7A, Fig. 8A, and Fig. 9A. In step III, for example, arsenic As is selectively ion implanted, as is shown in Fig. 8B, in a tunnel oxide film forming portion 1 1 and an area adjacent thereto, whereby an N type drain region D is formed.The state of other regions is not different from the state at the time of termination of the preceding step. In n step IV, the first gate oxide film OX1 in the tunnel oxide film forming portion 11 is selectively removed. In step V, a tunnel gate oxide film OX having as small a thickness as from about 80 A to o about 200 A is formed in the portion 11 according to the ordinary thermal oxidation method. This state is shown in Fig. BC. No particular change is brought about in other regions. In step VI , a first polysilicon layer PA having a o A0 thickness of from about 500 A to about 5,000 A is formed on the substrate according to a chemical vapor deposition CVD method. An N type electric conductivity is given to the first polysilicon layer PA at the time of deposition or by ion implantation. This state is shown in Fig. 7B, Fig. BD, and Fig. 9B. In step VII, patterning of the first polysilicon layer PA is carried out according to the customary photoetching method utilizing the dry etching technique . The state at the time of completion of this patterning is illustrated in Fig. 7C, Fig. BE, andFig. 9C. At this patterning step VII, only the width gate length of the tunnel gate is defined by a window formed in the first polysilicon layer PA, and the surfaces of active regions close to a gate SG in Fig. 5B of a select transistor and a gate MG in Fig. SB of a memory transistor are not exposed.Figure LO shows the shape of the pattern of the first polysilicon layer PA InFig. 10, PA designates a first polysilicon layer, TG designates a tunnel gate, reference numeral 12 designates a window formed in the layer PA, reference numeral 13 designates a region for the formation of a gate SG of a select transistor, reference numeral 14 designates a region for the formation of a gate MG of a memory transistor, and reference numeral 15 designates an active region. In step VIII, a second gate oxide film OX2 having a a thickness of from about 700 A to about 800 A is formed on the first polysilicon layer PA according to the ordinary thermal oxidation method. This state is shown in Fig. 7D, Fig. 8F, and Fig. 9D. In step IX, a contact window 4 Fig. 9 for electrically communicating the first polysilicon layer PA with the second polysilicon layer PB is formed on the second gate oxide film OX2 according to the customary photoetching method. No particular change is brought about in other regions at this step. In step X, a second polysilicon layer P having a O O thickness of from about 500 A to about 5,000 A is formed on the substrate according to the CVD method.This state is shown in Fig. 7E, Fig. 8G, and Fig. 9F. In steps XI and XII, patterning of the second polysilicon layer PB and the first polysilicon layerPA is carried out according to the double self aligning technique. More specifically, at first, patterning of the second polysilicon layer PB is effected by a first dry etching through a resist mask not shown . The state after this patterning is shown in Fig. 7F, Fig. 8H, and Fig. 9F. In step XII, a second dry etching is carried out through the same resist mask to remove the exposed second gate oxide film OX2, and, subsequently, patterning of the first polysilicon layer PA is effected to complete the formation of a gate SG of a select transistor having a two layer structure, a gate MG of a memory transistor, and a gate TC of a tunnel portion.At this step, a concave portion 3 Figs. 7G and 8I having a thickness corresponding substantially to the thickness of the first polysilicon layer PA is formed on the surface of the substrate in the portion corresponding to the window of the first polysilicon layer PA where only the second polysilicon layer PB is formed.However, since the concave portion 3 is not in contact with the gate SG of the select transistor and the gate MG of the cell transistor , no side etching portion undercut portion is formed below the gate SG and the designed gate length lg is maintained. This state is shown in Fig. 7G, Fig. SI, and Fig. 9F. In step XIII, ion implantation of, for example,As is effected on the exposed surface of the substrate by using the above mentioned gates as a mask to form anN type source region S and an N type drain region D. The state after the formation of the source and drain is shown in Fig. 7H, Fig. 8J, and Fig. 9F. Then insulating films and lines are formed the steps are not shown in the drawings . Thus, a semi conductor memory element of the present invention having a two transistor cell structure provided with a select transistor having a two layer gate where the first polysilicon layer PA is electrically communicated with the second polysilicon layer PB is formed. As is apparent from the foregoing description, according to the present invention, in the process for the production of a nonvolatile semiconductor memory element having a two transistor cell structure, shortening of the gate length of a select transistor to below the designed length is prevented. Accordingly, the punch through voltage between the source and drain in the select transistor is maintained at a predetermined level, and the reliability of information is increased. The present invention may be applied to memory elements other than the above mentioned Flotox type semiconductor memory element. Furthermore, the present invention may be applied in a case where a metal silicide is used as a gate electrode.
