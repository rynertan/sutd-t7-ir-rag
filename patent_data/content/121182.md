# Improved coolant level control arrangement for internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
The level of coolant in the coolant jacket of an evapora tion cooled engine wherein the coolant is boiled off in place of being forcefully circulated is detected by a plurality of level sensors so that even though the attitude of the coolant level changes due to a change in orientation of the engine or the like, as long as one of the sensors is immersed in the coolant, the pump which recirculates condensed coolant from a radiator is not energized. An additional low level sensor is used to lower the level of the coolant to an predetermined low level to promote rapid engine warm up during cold engine starts.
