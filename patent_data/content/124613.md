## Description
DESCRIPTIONTitle of the Invention NOVEL PLASMINOGEN ACTIVATOR, ITS PREPARATION PROCESS AND THROMBOLYTIC AGENT CONTAINING SAMETechnical Field This invention relates to a novel plasminogen activator derived from a human tissue, for example, a human kidney or blood vessel, its preparation process and a thrombolytic agent containing the same as an active ingredient.Background Art Plasminogen activators may be classified, in accordance with their sources, into tissue activators, vascular activators, blood activators, urokinase, and the like. Plasminogen activators play an important role in fibrinolytic fibrin decomposing activities and are found in a variety of organs of mammalian animals. On the other hand, a great deal of work has recently been made to obtain plasminogen activators from cultured cells. In the above work, there were used as cultivated cells, for example, malignant tumor cells, blood vessel endothelium, stimulated macrophage, granular starch cells stimulated by follicle stimulating hormone, and the like. There have also been reported biochemical and immunological properties of plasminogen activators isolated from humoral tissue homogenates, cultivated cells and culture media. However, the purification of human tissue plasminogen activator has seldom been carried out.This seems to be attributed to the difficulty in obtaining the starting material in a sufficient amount and, besides, the hydrophobic property of enzymes contained in the starting material and the instability of such enzymes in a buffer and, in some instances, the existence of unknown protease in the course of its purification. Under these circumstances, Rijken et al isolated human uterus plasminogen activator having a molecular weight of 69,000 and confirmed that the activator is similar both immunologically and biochemically to human vascular plasminogen activaror.In addition, another human vascular plasminogen activator having a molecular weight different from the above human uterus plasminogen activator has also been isolated and identified. Kwaan et al carried out an investigation on a plasminogen activator derived from human kidney tissue and uncovered that the activator is present principally in the endothelium of blood vessles, especially, in the enhothelium of veins Fed. Proc. 24, 387 1965 . It has also been reported by Kucinski et al J. Clin. Invest, 47, 1238 1253 1968 , Bernik et al J. Clin. Invest. 48, 1740 1753 1969 , Barlow et al Thromb. Res. 1, 201 208 1972 , sted et al Experimentia 33, 589 590 1978 3 and Lewis Thromb.Haemostas. 42, 895 890 1979 that such a plasminogen activator obtained from the cultivation of human kidney tissue is identical immunologically and physiochemically to urokinase. Urokinase, which is a plasminogen activator isolated from urine or cultivated kidney cells, and streptokininase chichis a plasminogen activator collected from streptococci are presently used as thrombolytic agent for the purpose of treating thrombosis. However, both uroninase and streptokinase are different from the normal plasminogen activator collected from blood. These plasminogen activators do not have any specific affinity to fibrin. Thus, the results obtained from the use of urokinase and streptokinase in the treatment of thrombosis were not fully satisfactory in every aspect. In order to obtain desired effects, it is necessary to administer them in relatively large amounts. However, massive administration induces such dangerous side effects as resolution of fibrinogen and internal bleeding.There is thus a strong outstanding demand for the development of a drug which may be prepared on a relatively large scale, have little side effects and enjoy high thrombus resolving activity. As a result of an intensive investigation on the tissue plasminogen activator isolated and purified from human kidneys and human blood vessels, the present inventors have surprisingly found a plasminogen activator having properties significantly different from those of the urokinase derived from human kidneys or human blood vessels, although it has been believed that urokinase is only the principal plasminogen activator available from human kidneys and human blood vessels. In the course of a further investigation on the plasminogen activator from various viewpoints, it has also been revealed that the plasminogen activator has strong thrombus resolving effect, leading to completion of this invention.Disclosure of the Invention An object of this invention is to provide a novel plasminogen activator. Another object of this invention is to provide a novel process for preparing the novel plasminogen activator. A further object of this invention is to provide a novel thrombolytic agent which has strong thrombolytic effect. The plasminogen activator, which is an ingredient of the thrombolytic agent according to this invention, has the following characteristic properties 1 The main protein band measured by the sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis has a molecular weight of about 70,000 5,000 2 The main band by the isoelectric point electrophoresis has a pI of 7 to 9 3 The plasminogen activator has the immunological property of not being unadsorbed by anti urokinase igG Sepharose affinity chromatography and 4 The plasminogen activator hydrolyzes H D valyl L leucyl L lysine p nitroanilide dihydrochloride and H D isoleucyl L prolyl arginine pnitroanilide dihydrochloride but does not hydrolyze Boc L valyl L prolyl L arginine 4 methylcoumaryl 7 amide, carbobenzoxy L phenylalanyl L arginine 4methylcoumaryl 7 amide, L prolyl L phenylalanylarginine 4 methylcoumaryl 7 amide and glutaryl glycylL arginine 4 methylcoumaryl 7 amide. The above plasminogen activator may preferably have the following various properties 1 extractable or perfusable from a tissue or blood vessel with a 1 2 mole NH4SCN solution pE 7.4 and purifiable in the presence of 0.18 Tween 80 or the like 2 adsorbed practically in its entirety on a fibrin Sepharose column and eluted with a 2 mole NHoSCN solution and 3 stable even in 2 weeks when stored at 40C in a buffer of pH 7.4. The novel plasminogen activator according to this invention is prepared by removing blood clot, connective tissue1 lipids and the like from a human kidney in accordance with a method known per se in the art and subjecting the resultant kidney tissue to an extraction treatment with a buffer or causing an NHSCN solution to perfuse through a blood vessel to subject the blood vessel to an extraction and then passing the thus obtained extract through a column selected from the group consisting of a column loaded with an ion exchange material, a metal chelate column, a column loaded with L arginine or an arginine derivative bound on a carrier, a column loaded with a hemagglutinin bound on a carrier or a combination of columns selected from the group to purify the same. The novel plasminogen activator of the present invention is capable of supplementing the immunological drawbacks of urokinase which has already been developed as a drug having thrombus dissolving activity, and can thus be used as an active ingrediment of a thrombolytic agent having strong thrombolytic effect.Brief Description of the Drawings In the drawings Figure 1 is a zinc chelate Sepharose chromatogram of a plasminogen activator obtained in Example l 3 Figure 2 is a concanavalin A Sepharose chromatogram of a plasminogen activator obtained inExample 1 4 Figure 3 is a CM Sepharose chromatogram of a plasminogen activator obtained in Example 1 5 Figure 4 shows results of the Sephacryl S 200 gel filtration of a plasminogen activator obtained in Example 1 6 Fi ure 5 illustrates the SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of a plasminogen activator according to this invention, which plasminogen activator had been isolated from kidneys.Letters A, B, C andD correspond respectively to the activator extracted from the kidneys and then purified, an activator extracted from vascular walls and then purified, an activator secreted from cultivated normal human diploid, and a commercially available urokinase sample Figure 6 depicts identification results of plasminogen activators according to this invention, which had in advance been subjected to SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoreses.

Unless otherwise specifically indicated, all the procedures were carried out at 4 C, Example 1 Purification of plasminogen activator obtained from kidney 1 Extraction of plasminogen activator After mechanically removing blood clot, connective tissue and lipids from a human kidney which was free of any infections symptom which had been stored at 700C , acetoneof 150C was added and the kidney was then ground down in a homogenizer. The suspension was stirred at 150C for 30 minutes and then allowed to stand at 200C. The surface flotage was removed by decantation and defattening was repeated with acetone of 150C.The resultant suspension was then filtered. The filtered cake was washed with acetone of 20 C and then dried. Thereafter, 100 g of the thus defattened powder was suspended in 1 liter of a 1 mole NH4SCN solution buffered with a 0.02 mole Tris HCl solution of pH 7.0 7.4. The resultant suspension was stirred. The suspension was separated into an extract and a precipitate by centrifugation. The precipitate was extracted again with the same 1 liter of the 1 moleNH4SCN solution. The extracts were combined to obtain a crude extract. 2 DEAE Sepharose chromatography The crude extract obtained in the above procedure 1 was diluted with the same amount of a 0.02 mole Tris HCl solution of pH 7.0 7.4. The thus prepared sample was passed through a DEAESepharose column which had been equilibrated with a 0.02 solution of a nonionic surfactant, i.e.,Tween 80 and a 0.02 mole Tris HCl solution which contained 0.25 mole of NH4SCN. The effluents of the column were combined, to which NaCl was added to make the final concentration be 1.0 mole. Its pH was adjusted to 7.4 with lN HCl. 3 Zinc chelate Sepharose chromatography The effluents obtained in the above procedure 2 were passed through a zinc chelate Sepharose column which had been equilibrated with a 0.002 mole Tris HCl solution which had a pH of 7.0 and contained 1.0 mole of NaCl, 0.25 mole of NH4SCN and 0.02 mole of Tween 80. After washing the column with the above equilibrating solution until the concentration of proteins in the eluate was lowered to 0.01 mg ml. Thereafter, the column was washed further with a buffer the composition of which was identical to the above equilibrating solution except that the buffer contained no NH4SCN but 0.15 mole of NaCl. The column was then washed with a 0.05 mole imidazole solution, thereby eluting the tissue activator into the washings. The profile of the resulting chromatogram is shown inFigure 1. 4 Concanavalin A Sepharose chromatography Fractions of the tissue activator, which fractions had been obtained in the above procedure 3 , were passed through a concanavalin A Sepharose column. The column had in advance equilibrated with a 0.02 mole tris HCl solution which had a pH of 7.4 and contained 0.15 mole of NaCI and 0.02 of Tween 80.After repeatedly washing the column with the equilib rating solution until the concentration of proteins in the eluate reached the base line, the tissue activator was eluted with an equilibrating solution which contained 0.5 mole of a D methylmannoside. Fractions containing the activator were combined and the pH of the resultant solution was adjusted to 4.5 with acetic acid. The profile of the resultant chromatogram is shown in Figure 2. Rijken et al reported that a linear gradient eluent of a U methylmannoside 0 0.6 mole is effective when isolating a plasminogen activator from human uterus tissue Biochim Biophys. Acta 580, 140 153 1979 1, When the linear gradient eluent of a D methylmannoside was employed, the elution profile of the activator activity was in conformity with that of proteins. Almost all the points of elution of the plasminogen activator were near the points of elution of the 0.35 mole a Dmethylmannoside solution and thus somewhat higher than those reported by Rijken et al. 5 CM Sepharose chromatography Tissue activator containing fractions obtained in the above procedure 4 were passed through a CM Sepharose column. The column had in advsn o ho n eanilibrated with 2 0.02 M acetic acid buffer which has a pH of 4.5 and contained 0.15 mole of NaCl and 0.02 of Tween 80. After washing the column with the equilibrating solution first of all, the column was developed with the same equilibrating solution except that the concentration of NaCl was linearly increased from 0.15 mole to 1.0 mole. The tissue activator was eluted near an NaCl concentration of 0.45 mole. The elution profile is illustrated in Figure 3. The tissue activator was adsorbed on the CM Sepharose in the equilibrating solution and about 50 60 of the loaded proteins was allowed to pass through the column.The tissue activator was eluted near an NaCl concentration of 0.45 mole. This is equivalent to about 40 elution of the proteins used. The specific activity was increased by about 2.4 times. Fractions containing the activator were combined together and subjected to an ultrafiltration through a Diaflo membrane PM 10 product of Amicon Corporation , thereby to concentrate the same. The exchange of the activator sample with a buffer was conducted on a Sephadex G 25 product of Pharmacia AB column. The column had in advance been equilibrated with a 0.02 mole Tris HCl solution which had a pH of 7.4 and contained 1.0 mole of NH4SCN. The column was developed with a buffer zilch was identical to the equilibrating solution. Fractions, which contained the thus eluted proteins, were combined together and then subjected to an ultrafiltration through a Diaflo membrane PM 10 to concentrate the same. 6 Sephacryl 5 200 gel filtration A concentrated sample of the tissue activator was caused to pass through a Sephacryl S 200 product of Pharmacia AB column which had in advance been equilibrated with a 0.02 mole Tris HCl solution which had a pH of 7.4 and contained l.0 mole of NH4SCN. Effluents, which were fractions of the tissue activator, were stored at 700C. The elution profile is shown in Figure 4.Example 2 Purification of plasminogen activator derived from blood vessel After washing a leg blood vessel with a buffered physiological saline pH 7.4 , the plasminogen activator was extracted from the vascular wall with a l mole NH4SCN solution. After salting the extract out with a 50 ammonium sulfate solution, the resultant solution was subjected to arginineSepharose chromatography. The plasminogen7 activator showed strong affinity to the arginine Sepharose and was elutedwith a 0.5 mole arginine solution. Its specific activity was enhanced by about 6 times in the above manner. Making use of the hydrophobic property of the plasminogen activator, the eluate was subjected to a phenyl Sepharose chromatography. The thus adsorbed plasminogen activator was eluted with a 50 ethylene glycol solution or a 1 solution of a non ionic surfactant, namely, Triton X 100. The specific activity of the plasminogen activator was enhanced by about 8 times in the above manner. Most of the proteins were eluted in earlier effluents by the Sephacryl 5 200 gel chromatography.The plasminogen activator was eluted in fractions which corresponded to a molecular weight of about 70,000. At this stage, the specific activity had been enhanced by about 2.2 times. Finally, the plasminogen activator was subjected to fibrin Sepharose chromatography. The plasminogen activator derived from human blood vessels had strong affinity to the fibrin Sepharose and its specific activity was enhanced by about 1.3 times. The specific activity, purification and percentage recovery achieved at each of the various stages in the above manner are shown in Table 1.

The apparent molecular weight of the purified vascular plasminogen activator was about 70,000 as measured by the SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.Its protein band was positive against the PAS dyeing and the plasminogen activator is basically believed to be a glycoprotein consisting of a single chain. The gel was sliced after the SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to investigate the distribution of the activity of the plasminogen activator. As a result, it was found that the activity of the plasminogen activator was completely consistent with that of the protein band. The isoelectric point pI of the main band of the vascular plasminogen activator according to this invention was 7.8. Using anti urokinase IgG, the antigenicity of the plasminogen activator of this invention was compared with that of urokinase. The activity of the vascular plasminogen activator was not inhibited at all by the anti urokinase IgG and did not show any affinity to the anti urokinase IgG Sepharose. An antivascular plasminogen activator which was obtained using the purified vascular plasminogen activator as an antigen inhibited the activity of the vascular plasminogen activator but did not inhibit the activity of urokinase. Using the antivascular plasminogen activator and anti urokinase serum, the antigenicities of both activators were studied in accordance with the double immunodiffusion method.As a result, both urokinase and vascular plasminogen activator developed individually a single precipitation curve between themselves and their corresponding antiurokinase and antivascular plasminogen activator serum.However, no crosslinking was observed between the precipitation curves. From the above results, it is understood that the vascular plasminogen activator according to this invention is immunologically different from urokinase. When the antivascular plasminogen activatorIgG was added to a fibrin membrane in Todd s fibrinolysis autography, the activity of the plasminogen activator which was observed in vegetative blood vessels of inner and outer membranes of a vein was suppressed. The suppression in activity of the vascular plasminogen activator was investigated using a variety of inhibitors As a result, activity inhibitions of 98 and 20 were observed respectively by diisopropyl fluorophosphate 5 mM and L arginine 0.1 M . No changes were observed by Trasylol 50 KIU ml , iodoacetamide t10 mM and soybeen trypsin inhibitor 50 pg ml . This indicates that the vascular plasminogen activator according to this invention belongs, similar to urokinase, to serine pro tease.Example 3 Analysis of tissue plasminogen activator and results 1 Unless otherwise specifically indicated, each plasminogen activator was analyzed by the fibrinagar plate method disclosed in Immunochemistry 9, 709 723 1972 . The fibrinolytic activity of the tissue activator was compared with that of urokinase and was expressed in terms of the international unit UKIU , The standard curves showing the activity of serial dilutions of both plasminogen activator of this invention and urokinase were straight in the range of 2 the lytic area of 70 240 mm . However, the gradient of the standard curve of the tissue activator was not completely consistent with that of urokinase.The activity of the tissue activator was determined by measuring the lytic areas of diluted samples within 2 the range of 120 200 mm . The lytic area of 10 iji 2 or 1 IU ml urokinase was 156 mm . The reproducibil of the fibrin agar plate method was 6 . The enzymatic activity of the tissue activator was standardized by the enzymatic activity of urokinase and the percentage recovery of the tissue activator and its specific activity relative to UKIU ml were measured after each of several purification stages. The non specific fibrin resolving activity was measured on a fibrin agar plate free of any plasminogen. In some instances, the measurement was carried out in accordance with the method which usedI fibrin monomer trapped in a cellulose nitrate disc Selectgun Type BA pore diameter 0.2 pm Progress in Chemical Fibrinolysis and Thrombolysis,Vol. 3, 539 546 1978 , Raven Press, New York .Fibrinogen which contained no human plasminogen was radiated by the method proposed by Hawker et al J, Clin. Pathol. 29, 495 501 1976 . The specific activity of the labeled substrate was 0.018 mCi mg fibrinogen. A sample mixture was incubated at 3i0C and a 50 pl portion was sampled out at each of 1st and 7th hours. Released 1251 was measured by an automatic gamma counter. The activity of each of the dilutions of the tissue activator and urokinase was expressed in terms of the percentage of releasedI relative to the total radioactivity by subtracting the released I. 2 Affinity chromatography on anti urokinase IgG Sepharose column The urokinase antiserum was obtained from a goat which had been immunized by a subcutaneous administration of 1 mg of high purity human urokinase m,w. 33,000 specific activity 202,400 IU mg . The above employed urokinase sample was the same as that analyzed above in accordance with the SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The anti urokinase serum showed only one precipitation curve when examined in accordance with the double immunodiffusion analysis. IgG fractions of antiurokinase goat serum and unimmunized goat serum were prepared by precipitating with a saturated 33 ammonium sulfate solution. They were purified further by DEAE Sepharose chromatography. The anti urokinase IgG 50 pg ml added to a fibrin plate inhibited completely the activity of the commercial urokinase sample which was used as an antigen 5,000 IU ml These IgG samples 20 mg ml individually developed a single precipitation curve when the immunoelectrophoresis was applied using antigoat serum and rabbit serum. Fifty milligrams of the anti urokinase or normal IgG sample was coupled with 15 ml of cyanogen bromide activated Sepharose CL 4B in accordance with the method proposed by Cuatrecasas J. Biol. Chem.245, 3059 3065, 1970 1. The gel was washed with a 0.02 mole Tris HCl solution, which had a pH of 7.4 and contained 1.0 mole of NaCl, of a volume at least 20 times the volume of the gel. Chromatograms of the tissue activator and urokinase are shown in Figure 7. 3 Adsorption of the tissue activator and urokinase on fibrin Sepharose According to the afore mentioned Cuatrecasas s method, 200 mg of fibrinogen which was free of human plasminogen was coupled at pH 8.3 with 20 g of cyanogen bromide activated Sepharose CL4B. The thus coupled fibrinogen was then activated by an addition of thrombin 1 Unit ml in accordance with the method proposed by Reeme et al Thromb. Res. 2, 137 143 1973 .Thereafter, it was washed with a 0.02 mole Tris HCI solution which had a pH of 7.4 and contained 0.15 mole of NaCl, 0.1 of Triton X 100, and 1 micromole ofAprotinin product of Beyer AG . The gel, which had been loaded in the column, was washed with 2 mole ofNH4SCN dissolved in a buffer, followed by an addition of a urokinase or tissue activator sample which was obtained from the stage 6 of Example 1 in a buffer to the column. After washing the column, the column was eluted with a 2 mole NH4SCH solution. The activity of the plasminogen activator was measured in accordance with a method which employed the concentration of proteins in the eluate and a chromogenic substrateS 2288. 4 Other methods The quantitative analyses of proteins were conducted using the method proposed by Lowry et al, which method used bovine serum albumine as a standard protein J. Biol. Chem. 193, 265 275 1951 J. Solubilized proteins in Tween 80 were quantatively analyzed by the method proposed by Shiu et al J. Biol.Chem. 249, 7902 7911 1974 3, after the sediment was removed by centrifugal separation. In some instances, a more accurate method making use of fluorescamine was used Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 155, 213 220 1973 3. Eluates obtained after the Sephacryl S 200 chromatography were monitored using an LKB Uviicord II detector and recorder, which detector was equipped with aHitachi Spectrophotometer Model 200 200. The SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was conducted in accordance with the method proposed by Weber et al J. Biol. Chem. 244, 4406 4412 1972 J. Each protein sample was incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes in a 1.0 SDS solution and then subjected to electrophoresis in a 5 polyacrylamide gel. In some instances, proteins were reduced with a 1 solution of 2 mercaptoethanol. The gel dyed a protein with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or a glycoprotein with periodic acid Schiff s reagent. In order to measure the activity of the plasminogen activator, the SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was conducted in a 5 polyacrylamide gel in accordance with the slab gel system. After conducting the electrophoresis, the slab gel was washed at room temperature for 2 hours with a 0.01 mole phosphoric acid buffer which had a pH of 7.4 and contained 0.5 mole of NaCl and 2 of Tween 80.The gel was then stacked with a 1 agarose gel which contained 0.2 of human fibrinogen either rich in or free of plasminogen and 0.5 unit of thrombine. The contents were then incubated for 1 7 hours at 370C in a constanthumidity chamber and the agarose and polyacrylamide gel were dyed with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The apparent molecular weight of the protein was measured by comparing its mobility with the mobility of the standard protein in accordance with the aforementioned method proposed by Weber et al. The measurement of the isoelectric point of the thus purified tissue activator was carried out in a 7.5t polyacrylamide gel containing 8 moles of urea and 1 of an ampholyte in accordance with the method proposed by hertz et al Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.49, 84 91 1972 . The sample was solubilized in an 8 mole urea solution which contained 2 millimoles ofEDTA and 1 of an ampholyte. Its pH was determined by the method proposed by Finlayson et al Anal. Biochem. 40, 292 311 1971 . The thus purified tissue activator was tested with various fluorescent substrates, after adding 50 p1 of the tissue activator sample in a 0.02 mole Tris HCl solution having a pH of 8.0 and containing 0.1 mole ofNaCl and 0.02 of Tween 80 and 2.0 ml of the substrate in the same buffer. The following materials were used as fluorescent substrates Boc L Valyl L prolyl L arginine 4 methyl cumaryl 7 amide Carbobenzoxy L phenylalanyl l arginine 4 methylcumaryl 7 amide L Prolyl L phenylalanyl l arginine 4 methylcumaryl 7 amide, and Glutaryl glycyl L argiine 4 methylcumaryl 7 amide.The initial release of 7 amino 4 methylcumarine AMC was measured by a fluorometer, at 370C in a ShimadzuFluorospectrophotometer Model RF 520. The fluorometer had been set in such a manner that a radiation of light of 380 nm would have permitted to emit an excited fluorescent light of 460 nm. The fluorometer was also adjusted so that a 0.2 mole AMC solution in a 0.1 DMSO solution gave a relative fluorescent unit of 1.0. The hydrolytic activity of the purified tissue activator was measured with a chromogenic.substrate, after adding 200 l of a tissue activator sample, 200 ul of a 0.1 mole Tris HCl solution having a pH of 8.0 and containing 0.1 mole of NaCl and 0.02 of Tween 80, and 200 l of a 3 millimole S 2251 solution or a l millimole S 2288 solution. The initial release of p nitroaniline was measured by a spectrophotometer, at 405 nm and 370C in a glass cell. The initial velocity of the hydrolytic activity was expressed in terms of AmA min for the chromogenic substrate and At min. for the fluorescent substrate. The inhibitory effects of the tissue activator when treated respectively with diisopropyl fluorophosphate, iodoacetamide, soybean trypsin inhibitor and L arginine aprotinin were tested with the chromogenic substrate S 2288.The purified tissue activator samples were incubated at 370C for 1 hour after adding the inhibitors therein. A 200 l portion was taken out from each mixture, followed by an addition of 200 pl of a buffer and 1 millimole of the substrate. By comparing hA min. values with one another, the inhibitory effect of each reagent was measured. 5 Samples were purified by the method ofExample 1 and then analyzed in accordance with the analytic method described in Example 2.

As a result, the molecular weight of the kidney originated activator and that of the vascular activator were about 72,000 and 70,000 respectively.These tissue activators were positive to the periodic acid Schiff s reagent, thereby indicating the presence of sugar chains In the case of the kidney originated activator for instance, the mobility of the main band of the purified tissue activator as measured by the electrophoresis was identical to the mobility of the main band of resolved fibrin of a crude extract, when the crude extract and purified tissue activator were respectively analyzed by the SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the resulting gels were respectively developed on fibrin agar plates. This indicates that the apparent molecular weight was 70,000 see,Figure 6 . The band of resolved fibrin was attributed to the presence of plasminogen in the fibrin agar plate. From the above finding, it is understood that the crude extract obtained from human kidney tissue contains a plasminogen activator and the plasminogen activator consists principally of that having an apparent molecular weight of about 70,000.A similar experiment was also conducted using an activator derived from a blood vessel. Its molecular weight was estimated to be about 70,000. 2 Isoelectric points As the isoelectric points of purified activators, the main peaks appeared at 8.2 in the case of a kidney originated activator and at 7.8 in the case of an activator derived from a blood vessel.After measurement of each isoelectric point, its activity was measured on a fibrin agar plate which was in the form of a thin film gel thickness 1.5 mm .The activity of the activators were found respectively near their isoelectric points, i.e., pH 8.2 and 7.8. 3 Immunological differences between tissue activators and urokinase In order to study whether the activators obtained respectively from kidney tissue and the wall of a blood vessel have the same antigenicity as urokinase, the elution profile of proteins obtained by the antiurokinase IgG Sepharose affinity chromatographic treatment of the purified activator of Example 1 6 and the activator of Example 1 3 and active ingredient of the activator was compared with the elution profile of urokinase. Results are shown inFigure 7. As seen from Figure 7, urokinase was adsorbed strongly on the column and almost all the loaded activity was eluted with a 0.1 mole glycine HCl solution which contained 0.15 mole of NaCl and Q.1 of Triton X 100.The protein contained in the effluents was serum albumine which had been incorporated in the commercial urokinase used in this experiment. On the other hand, the purified activator was passed through the column. It was however not adsorbed and neither protein nor activity was eluted with a glycine solution of pH 2.4. When the partially purified sample obtained in Example 1 3 was poured in the same column, about 15 of the poured activity was adsorbed on the column and eluted with a glycine solution of pH 2.4. On the basis of these findings, it is readily envisaged that the plasminogen activator of this invention is a tissue activator which is immunologically dissimilar to urokinase and the crude extract obtained from kidneys contains, as a minor ingredient, urokinase or an urokinase like activator.On the other hand, the antiserum for the activator obtained from the wall of the blood vessel underwent a ready cross linking reaction, thereby indicating that they are similar also from the immunological viewpoint. 4 Affinity of tissue activators to fibrin Sepharose The affinity of each of urokinase and a tissue activator to insolulized fibrin monomer was investigated using fibrin Sepharose columns. The tissue activator according to this invention Example 1 6 3 was adsorbed in its entirety on the fibrin Sepharose column. It was then eluted with a 2 mole NH4SCN solution and at least 90 of the total poured activity was recovered. On the other hand, almost the whole active ingredients of urokinase were allowed to pass through the column. The activity of the activator was thus not found in the eluate obtained with a 2 mole NH4SCN solution from the column. As has been mentioned above, the tissue activator of this invention which was obtained from human kidneys has strong affinity to fibrin Sepharose. 5 Specificity of synthetic substrates to tissue activators The specificity of certain synthetic substrates to the activator obtained in Example 1 6 was studied. The following substrates were employed. For plasmin, H D valyl L leucyl L lysine p nitroanilide dihydrochloride S 2251 For natural thrombine, Boc L valyl L prolyl L arginine 4 methylcoumaryl 7 amide 3093 V For plasma, carbobenzoxy L phenylalanyl L arginine 4 methylcoumaryl 7 amide 3095 V For urine kallikrein, L prolyl L phenylalanyl 1 arginine 4 methylcoumaryl 7 amide 3096 V For urokinase, glutamyl glycyl L arginine 4 methylcoumaryl 7 amide 3097 V and For tissue plasminogen activator, H Disoleucyl L prolyl L arginine p nitroanilide dihydrochloride S 2288 . The tissue activator of this invention did not show hydrolytic activity to any substrates other than S 2251 and S 2288. The activity 100 UKIU ml of the tissue activator according to this invention was 88 AmA min. against S 2251 and 70 AmA min. againstS 2288. The activator of this invention showed some characteristic properties when treated with certain inhibitors. The amide decomposing activity of the activator of this invention against S 2288 was not inhibited where 50 KIU ml of Aprotinin, 10 millimoles or iodoacetamide or 50 pg ml of soybeen trypsin was used as an inhibitor. However, it was inhibited up to 26 by 100 millimoles of L arginine and up to 98 by 5 millimoles of diisopropyl fluorophosphate. 6 Stability In the case of the plasminogen activator according to this invention, no activity reduction was observed at all even two weeks later when stored at 40C in a buffer of pH 7.4. The same result was also obtained even when 1 mole of NH4SCN, 0.02 of Tween 80 or 0.1 mole of NaCl was incorporated in the buffer. The stability of the plasminogen activator of this invention was investigated at 40C for 24 hours in buffers which had pH levels in the range of 1 10 and contained 0.5 mole of NaCl and 0.02 of Tween 80.As a result, it was found that the plasminogen activator of this invention was stable within the pH range of 2 10 but an activity reduction of 70 occurred at pH 1.0. As has been described in detail, the activator of this invention is a novel plasminogen activator which is different from urokinase and plays an important role in the control of recovery of a tissue, including the decomposition of fibrin deposits on inner and outer vascular walls at a damaged part. Needless to say, the novel plasminogen activator according to this invention can be isolated from various organs of mammalian animals. All plasminogen activators must be considered to fall within the scope of this invention irrespective of their sources, so long as they have properties characteristic to the plasminogen activator of this invention. In accordance with the above described preparation process of the activator to which process the present invention also relates, the tissue activator can be isolated in a highly purified formThe tissue activator shows a specific activity as much as 30,000 45,000 times the specific activity of a human kidney dried with acetone. The thrombolytic agent according to this invention will naturally become apparent from the following Examples. It should however be borne in mind that the plasminogen activator, which was used as an ingredient, had been derived from normal cells.A plasminogen activator originated from malignant tumor cells is known to have thrombolytic activity However, the safety of a thrombolytic agent according to this invention is believed to have already been assured owing to its origin, when, in view of its manner of application as a drug to be administered to men, one takes into consideration various potential risks in its administration over a long period of time or at a high dosage level. Since the plasminogen activator as an ingredient of a thrombolytic agent according to this invention has specific affinity, which is different from that of urokinase but similar to that of the normal plasminogen activator obtained from blood, to fibrin, the thrombolytic agent can bring about fully satisfactory results when employed for the treatment of thrombosis. In addition, the thrombolytic agent according to this invention is free from such side effects as internal bleeding and anaphylaxis shock.Accordingly, the thrombus resolvent according to this invention is an extremely effective therapeutic drug. The thrombolytic agent of this invention may be administered at suitable dosage levels to patients and has potency accompanied with slight or no side effects and effective thrombolytic activity. Namely, the thrombolytic agent according to this invention may be administered in much the same way as commonlyemployed other drugs of the same type. For example, the plasminogen activator which is an active ingredient may be dissolved in a physiological saline containing 5 of human serum albumin and may then be administered by injection. Here, it is preferred to limit each dosage to 10,000 IU about 100 pg as measured in terms of urokinase. The thrombolytic agent according to this invention may be used to treat acute and chronic thrombus occulusions of various blood vascular beds as encountered in cases of deep venous thrombosis, plmonary embolism, myocardial infraction, arterial occlusion, extracorporeal circulation and arteriovenous occlusion. The thrombolytic agent according to this invention will hereinafter be described specifically by the following Examples.Example 5 Isolation and purification of the plasminogen activator constituting the active ingredient of the thrombolytic agent of this invention To 100 g of defatted powder prepared from human kidneys with acetone, was added 500 ml of a 2mole solution of ammonium thiocyanate which solution had been buffered with a 0.02 mole Tris HCl at pH 7.4.The resultant mixture was stirred at 40C for 10 hours and then subjected to centrifugal separation x 13,000 g 30 minutes to separate the same into an extract and precipitate. The extract was adjusted to pH 3 0 with lN HCl and the resulting precipitate was recovered by centrifugal separation x 13,000 g 30 minutes .The precipitate was then dissolved in 500 ml of a 0.01 mole sodium phosphate buffer buffer A which contained 1 millimole of EDTA, 0.3 mole of Nail, 10 KIU ml of Aprotinin, 5 millimoles of aminocaproic acid and 0.01 of Tween 80. Thereafter, 100 ml of fibrin celite was added to the buffer and the resulting mixture was stirred at 40C for 30 minutes. The mixture was then subjected to centrifugal separation x 3,000 g 10 minutes . The precipitate was suspended again in 100 ml of the buffer A and the thus prepared solution was poured into a column of 4 x 10 cm. The column was washed with 500 ml of the buffer A. Thereafter, the plasminogen activator was eluted with the buffer A which additionally contained 0.4 mole of arginine. The eluates were collected in 10 ml fractions. Results are shown inFigure 8 and Table 3.The above purification method gave a percentage recovery as high as about 30 .The purification method utilizes the strong affinity of the plasminogen activator constituting the ingredient of the thrombolytic agent of this invention, to fibrin.

The experiment was conducted using human blood collected from a healthy male volunteer. A 5 ml of blood was collected exactly, to which 0.5 ml of a 3.1 sodium citrate solution was added to avoid blood coagulation. Then, 50 pl of 125i labeled fibrinogen was also added. After mixing them well, 1.5 ml portions of the mixture were taken and placed in a tygon tube having a length of 28 cm and an internal diameter of 0.36 cm, followed by an addition of 20 millimoles of calcium chloride. Then, both ends of the tube were connected to each other to form a loop. The looped circulation tube was fixed on a turn table which was inclined at an angle of 230 and revolved at a speed of 17 rpm. After allowing blood to clot at room temperature 24 250 C and for 1 to 24 hours, the tube was opened and a 10 p1 sample was collected.Its radioactivity was then measured.Thereafter, the plasminogen activator was added to the tube and the tube was connected at both ends thereof. It was again revolved on the turn table.After a predetermined time, a 10 p1 blood sample was taken out and measured for radioactivity. The activity of the above plasminogen activator was 125 expressed as the amount of I released from blood clot and present in blood sample. 125 The thus added 125I fibrinogen was incor porated into the polymer of the clot with an efficiency of about 95 98 . The degree of crosslinking after 1 hour was different from that after 24 hours. That is, partially cross linked PXL clot was obtained after 1 hour and totally cross linked TXL clot was obtained after 24 hours. Figure 9 illustrates the state of resolution of a PXL clot by the plasminogen activator constituting the active ingredient of the thrombolytic agent of this invention, or urokinase. In Figure 9, the curve a corresponds to the plasminogen activator while the curve b corresponds to urokinase. These curves show that the plasminogen activator constituting the active ingredient of the thrombolytic agent of this invention induces a highly efficient dissolution compared with urokinase.When the plasminogen activator constituting the active ingredient of the thrombolytic agent of this invention was added in the same amount as that used in the system of the curve a to the system of the curve b in 10 hours, almost complete dissolution was achieved see, Figure 9 c 3. In Figure 9, each dot represents the average of triplicate measurements. When the concentration of the activator was adjusted to 1 x 10 9 mole, the activator which was the ingredient of the thrombolytic agent of this invention dissolved the PXL clot almost completely 20 hours. In contrast to the plasminogen activator, urokinase was eluted to about 40 only.when the plasminogen activator constituting the active ingredient of the thrombolytic agent of this invention was added 10 hours later in the above system, almost complete release of 1251 took place, thereby indicating that the activator has a strong thrombolytic activity. In an experiment in which the TXL clot was employed, urokinase showed a dissolution of only 35 even 20 hours later but the plasminogen activator constituting an ingredient of the thrombolytic agent of this invention showed a dissolution of 90 . As a control, a further experiment was conducted without pouring the plasminogen activator at all. The release of 125I was not detected at all. It is thus indicated that the dissolution of blood clot depended on the activator.Example 7 Effects of the thrombolytic agent of this invention for thrombosis in various animals Blood was collected from various animals in a manner similar to that employed in Example 6 and allowed to clot for 1 hour. The plasminogen activator constituting the ingredient of the thrombolytic agent of this invention was caused to act on the partially cross linked PXL clots in the plasmas of the respective animals so as to investigate the thrombolytic activity of the plasminogen activator.In each experiment, the concentration of the plasminogen activator was adjusted to 20 IU ml and the degree of resolution of the clot was measured in terms ofI released from the clots until 10 hours from the commencement of the reaction. In this system, the background was substantially equal to that obtained without adding the plasminogen activator and only 2 3 of I was detected even 10 hours later. In contrast, about 96 of the clot was dissolved in the human system. Figure 10 illustrates the results obtained by evaluating the degree of dissolution using bloods of man and various animals. In Figure 10, curves a , b , c , d and e show the results obtained with human, monkey, rabbit, dog and rat blood.As illustrated in Figure 10, the degree of dissolution varied according to the animal species. The plasminogen activator works well in the case of monkey, similar to the case of human. The dissolving effect was poor in the case of rat. This indicates that the thrombolytic agent according to this invention is an enzyme specific to human and monkey.
