The compounds of this invention having antiallergic activity may be used for the same indications as clinically used antiasthmatic compounds, namely to help to control bronchoconstriction or brochospasm characteristic of allergic asthma and exercise induced asthma and the symptoms of bronchoconstriction and bronchospasm resulting from acute or chronic bronchitis. the compounds are believed to inhibit the release of autacoids i.e. histamine, scrotonin and the like from mast cells and to inhibit directly the antigen induced production of histamine. Thus, they may be classified as mast cell stabilizers with antihistaminic action. The compounds of this invention having antihistamine activity may be used for the same indications as clinically used antihistamines, namely to relieve detrimental symptoms caused by histamine release of nasal stuffiness due to colds and vasomotor rhinitis and for the symptomatic control of allergic conditions includig nasal allergy, perennial rhinitis, urticaria, angioneurotic oedema, allergic conjunctivitis, food allergy, drug and serum reactions, insect bites and stings and desensitizing reactions. The compound may also be used in conditions responsive to its antipruritic activity including allergic dermatoses, neurodermatitis, anogenital pruritus, and pruritus of non specific origin such as eczema, and of specific cause such as chickenpox, photosensitivity and sunburn. The present invention therefore provides a method for the symptomatic treatment of allergic conditions by the administration of an effective amount of a compound of the formula I . The present invention also provides a method for the antagonism of endogenously released histamine by the administration of an effective amount of a compound of the formula I . Some of the compounds of the present invention have been found to be substantially free from sedative effects and to have little or no anticholinergic effects. The amount of active compound required for use in the above conditions will vary with the compound chosen, the route of administration and the condition and mammal undergong treatment, and is ultimately at the discretion of the physician. A suitable oral dose of the active compound for a mammal is in the range of from 0.003 to 1.0 mg per kilogram body weight per day preferably from 0.04 to 0.24 mg kg. For example a typical dose for a human recipient of compound B see example 2 and Table 1 hereafter is between 0.03 and 0.1 mg kg body weight per day. The desired daily dose is preferably presented as from one to six sub doses administered at appropriate intervals throughout the day as needed. Where three subdoses of compounds of formula I are employed, each will preferably lie in the range of from 0.014 to 0.08 mg kg body weight for example, a typical sub dose for such a compound for a human recipient is between 1 and 20 mg, for example 4 or 8 mg. Whilst it is possible for a compound of the formula I to be administered alone as the raw chemical, it is preferable to present the compound of formula I as a pharmaceutical formulation. Thus, the present invention also provides pharmaceutical formulations, both for veterinary and for human medical use, which comprise a compound of the formula I together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers thereof and optionally any other therapeutic ingredients. For example, the active compound may be formulated with a sympathomimetic agent such as the decongestant pseudoephedrine, an antitussive such as codeine, an analgesic, an antiinflammatory, an antipyretic, or an expectorant. The carrier s must be pharmaceutically acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. The formulation include those suitable for oral, rectal, topical, nasal, ophthalmic or parenteral including subcutaneous, intramuscular and intravenous administration. The formulation may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. All methods include the step of bringing the active compound into association with a carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing the active compound into association with a liquid carrier or a finely divided solid carrier or both and then, if necessary, shaping the product into desired formulations. Formulations of the present invention suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets, tablets or lozenges, each containing a predetermined amount of the active compound defined herein as a compound of formula I as a powder or granules or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or nonaqueous liquid such as a syrup, an elixir, an emulsion or a draught. A tablet may be made by compression or moulding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine, with the active compound being in a free flowing form such as a powder or granules, which is optionally mixed with a binder, disintegrant, lubricant, inert diluent, surface active agent or dispersing agent. Moulded tablets comprised of a mixture of the powdered active compound with any suitable carrier may be made by moulding in a suitable machine. A syrup may be made by adding the active compound to a concentrated, aqueous solution of a sugar for example sucrose to which may also be added any accessory ingredient s . Such accessory ingredient s may include flavouring, an agent to retard crystallization of the sugar or an agent to increase the solubility of any other ingredient, such as a polyhydric alcohol, for example glycerol or sorbitol, and suitable preservatives. Formulations for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with a usual carrier such as cocoa butter, or hydrogenated fats or hydrogenated fatty carboxylic acids. Formulations suitable for parenteral administration conveniently comprise a sterile aqueous preparation of the active compound which is preferably isotonic with the blood of the recipient. Nasal spray formulations comprise purified aqueous solutions of the active compound with preservative agents and isotonic agents. Such Ophthalmic formulations are prepared by a similar method to the nasal spray except that the pH and isotonic factors are adjusted to match that of the eye. Topical formulations comprise the active compound dissolved or suspended in one or more media such as mineral oil, petroleum, polyhydroxy alcohols or other bases used for topical pharmaceutical formulations. The addition of other accessory ingredients, In addition to the aforementioned ingredients, the formulations of this invention may further include one or more accessory ingredient s selected from diluents, buffers, flavouring agents, binders, disintegrants surface agents, thickeners, lubricants, preservatives including antioxidants and the like.
