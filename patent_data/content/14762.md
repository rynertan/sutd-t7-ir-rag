# Annular weld inspection apparatus.

## Abstract
Apparatus for remote inspection of annular curved ridge welds 42 . Included in such apparatus is a small sized televi sion camera 46 , an annular image transformation lens 50 of greater size than the observed weld 42 for presenting a flattened expanded image of such weld 42 to the camera, a circular array of work illumination lamps 63 at the input end of the camera 46 , and a hollow cylindrical light conductive member 60 mounted at its one end on the input end of the camera in exposure to the lamps 63 and mounting the image transformation lens 50 on its opposite end for proximity to the annular weld 42 being inspected. With this apparatus an enlarged flattened picture of the weld is presented to the camera for fast and thorough inspec tion of the weld.
