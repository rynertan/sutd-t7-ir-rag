# Process for producing silver halide emulsion.

## Abstract
A process for producing a tabular silver halide emulsion by using a sulfur containing silver halide solvent that promotes growth of silver halide grains, and a light sensitive material containing the emulsion are disclosed. The grain growth effect fo the silver halide solvent is reduced or eliminated by using an oxidizing agent thereby excluding the adverse effect of the sil ver halide solvent upon chemical ripening.
