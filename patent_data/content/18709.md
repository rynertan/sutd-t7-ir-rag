# Thermotropic polyesters of 2,6 dihydroxy anthraquinone, the production thereof, moulding powders, fibres and melts produced from these polyesters.

## Abstract
A thermotropic wholly aromatic polyester is provided which is capable of forming an anisotropic melt phase. This novel polyester displays surprising tractability and may be used as a moulding resin or may be melt spun into fibres. The aromatic polyester of the present invention consists essentially of the recurring units a 2,6, dioxyanthraquinone moiety, b 4 oxybenzoyl moiety, and c aromatic diacid moiety. The resulting polyester exhibits a melting point below approximately 375 C, and preferably below approximately 350 C. Fibres which are melt spun from the polyester exhibit unexpectedly good thermal stability. The desirable tractability properties of the polyester are attributed to its anisotropic melt phase, which is due to the inclusion of the 2,6 dioxyanthraquinone moiety in the polymer.
