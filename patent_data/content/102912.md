# A process for the purification of diisopropenylbenzene.

## Abstract
This invention discloses a process for the separation of diisopropenylbenzene from organic impurities in a dehyd rogenation mixture comprising 1 hydrogenating said dehydrogenation mixture to a maximum isopropenylstyrene concentration of no more than about 5 by weight in the presence of a rhodium catalyst and hydrogen to form a hydrogenated dehydrogenation mixture, followed by, 2 fractionally distilling said hydrogenated dehydrogenation mixture under conditions sufficient to separate said diisop ropenylbenzene from said organic impurities in said hyd rogenated dehydrogenation mixture.
