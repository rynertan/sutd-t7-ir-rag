# METHOD OF PRODUCING A CHRYSOBERYL SINGLE CRYSTAL.

## Abstract
A chrysoberyl single crystal with an iridescent effect is prepared by sintering or melt solidifying a mixture of a major component composed of almost equimolar amounts of beryllium oxide and aluminum oxide and small amounts of titanium oxide and metal oxide colorant in an atmosphere of non oxidative gas to prepare a starting rod, heating the rod in an atmosphere of non oxidative gas according to con verge heating type floating zone method to grow chry soberyl single crystal, then heat treating the crystal to precipitate needle like titanium oxide crystals with direction al properties in the single crystal.
