# YARN STORAGE AND DELIVERY APPARATUS

## Abstract
A yarn wrapping member 16 and a yarn winding drum 7 are rotated in opposite directions. Therefore, a yarn 21 fed to the yard wrapping member 16 is wrapped around the yarn winding drum at a speed which corresponds to the sum of the rotative speeds of the yarn wrapping member 16 and yarn winding drum 7 . The yarn 21 unwound from the yarn winding drum 7 is passed through the hollow portion of a main shaft 2 for delivery to the outside.
