## Description
The present invention relates to methods of assay of one of a pair of specific binding partners, and to kits of reagents for carrying out these methods. There is today a great need for rapid and accurate methods of assaying biologically active substances which may be at low concentration , particularly in body fluids such as blood, saliva or urine. A wide variety of medical conditions, such as pregnancy, drug overdose, metabolic birth defects, hormonal disorders and diabetes can be diagnosed using such assay techniques. Many assay methods rely on the formation of a complex between the species under assay hereinafter called ligand and another species to which it will bind specifically hereinafter called specific binding partner . The extent of complex formation is a function of the amount of the ligand present. The assay of ligand is determined by monitoring the extent of complex formation, for example by the use of chemical or biochemical labels. Several methods of labelling have been employed, for example radioisotopic or enzyme labelling, spin labelling or labelling employing fluorescent or bioluminescent species. The use of radioisotopic labels has been Particularly widespread, due to the high degree of sensitivity and specificity obtainable. There are, however, serious disadvantages to the use of radioactive labels. Radioactive labels have limited shelf life due to spontaneous decay, necessitating frequent recalibration of the equipment, and their use requires adherence to strict safety precautions and is subject to legal regulation. These disadvantages inevitably lead to higher costs and necessity for high standards of sophistication of equipment, laboratory facilities and personnel. EP 125139 and EP 149339 are prior art under Article 54 3 EPC. We have now found that electron transfer mediators which are capable of aiding the transfer of electrons from an electron source to an electrode or the transfer of electrons from the electrode to an electron acceptor may be employed as labels to overcome the problems associated with known labels as discussed above and to provide a sensitive, specific and convenient assay method. Thus, an aspect of the present invention provides a method of assaying a ligand in a sample using electrochemical apparatus having a working electrode and an auxiliary electrode, which method comprises contacting the sample with components comprising In one contracting state AT the proviso is that where no controlled external influence is employed, no component c is present and the said ligand is a polynucleotide strand, component a is a non enzymic reagent. In the remaining contracting states as can be seen from the claims the proviso is that component a is a non enzymic reagent where I no component c is employed or a mediator labelled ligand analogue is employed as component c , in either case without perturbation of electron transfer by means of a controlled external influence, or where II component c is a mediator labelled specific binding partner and a controlled external influence is employed. A further aspect of the invention provides a kit for carrying out a method of assay as defined above comprising In the case where the method is a heterogeneous competitive assay, the kit for carrying out the assay comprises In the case where the assay is a competitive sandwich assay the kit for carrying out the assay comprises Another aspect of the invention provides an electrochemical method of assay of a ligand in a sample using electrochemical apparatus having a working electrode and an auxiliary electrode, which method comprises the steps of The method of the present invention can be used for either qualitative or quantitative assays, the assay being completed by comparing the determined perturbation with calibration data. The term ligand analogue used herein refers to a species capable of complexing with the same specific binding partner as the ligand under assay, and includes Electron sources or acceptors comprising component a may be single species or two or more co operating species. Thus, for example, ascorbate may function as an electron source, apomorphine, substituted catechols such as 1 amino 2 3,4 dihydroxyphenyl ethane or 1 amino 2 3,4,5 trihydroxyphenyl ethane or aminophenols such as p aminophenol or 1 amino 2 2 amino 4,5 dihydroxyphenyl ethane suitably being employed as labels for components b and, if present, c , or dihydronicotinamide adenosine diphosphate NADH may function as an electron source, with quinones eg o quinones such as the oxidised forms of dopamine 3 hydroxytyramine and3, 4 dihydroxybenzylamine as labels. Alternatively, enzymes in co operation with their substrates may be employed. Particularly suitable enzymes include the so called oxido reductases, particularly, but not exclusively, flavo and quinoprotein enzymes, e.g. glucose oxidase, glucose dehydrogenase or methanol dehydrogenase. The term enzyme used herein includes true enzymes, e.g. of the types previously mentioned, and apoenzymes which may become activated in the presence of a cofactor. As an apoenzyme, for example, apoglucose oxidase may be used. Other electron sources and acceptors and suitable mediators therefor are known in the art. The preferred electron sources are oxidoreductase enzymes e.g. those mentioned above . Thus according to a preferred feature, the present invention provides a method of assaying a ligand in a sample as hereinbefore defined, wherein component a is an oxidoreductase enzyme in co operation with a substrate therefor. Suitable labels for components b and c for use in such a preferred method may, for example, be capable of accepting electrons from the enzyme and donating them to the electrode during substrate oxidation , or may be capable of accepting electrons from the electrode and donating them to the enzyme during substrate reduction . Such labels may, for example, be selected from the following Mediators may interact with the enzyme at a site remote from or near to the active site for the substrate reaction. Of the aforementioned electron transfer mediators, the preferred are ferrocene and functionalised derivatives thereof. These compounds are desirable for this purpose because they are relatively cheap, stable, water soluble, non toxic, and provide an easily electrochemically reversible system which in its reduced Fe Functionalisation may be required e.g. to permit attachment of the label to the reagent molecule. The redox potential of ferrocene is 422 mV vs NHE. By introducing functional groups on to the ring system, this figure can be varied between 300 and 650 mV. Moreover, the water solubility of carboxy substituted ferrocenes is greater than that of the parent compound see, e.g. Szentrimay, R., 1977, Amer. Chem. Soc. Symposium Series, Thus, for example, in the case of ferrocene, it may be necessary to modify the ferrocene complex by providing one or both of the cyclopentadienyl groups with one or more side chains, e.g. of the formula The interaction between the mediator label and the enzyme may thus take the form of chemical bonding, or may take the form of non chemical bonding or non bonding interaction. The working electrode from which the electrochemical readings will be taken will preferably be solid and have a electrically conductive working surface of e.g. carbon preferably graphite, e.g. pyrolytic graphite , or metal, e.g. silver, gold or platinum. If the electrode is of carbon, it may be present as a pre formed rod or as an electrode shape made up of a paste of carbon particles. The nature of the surface of the electrode is usually important. If metal, the surface can be roughened or chemically modified if solid carbon, the surface can be previously heat treated in an oven with oxygen excess or oxidized electrochemically. Thus, for example, when ascorbate is used as an electron source, a carbon paste electrode of polished glassy carbon sheets may advantageously be employed. In addition to the working electrode from which the electrochemical readings will be taken, the apparatus may comprise an auxiliary counter electrode and optionally a reference electrode, the electrodes being used in conjunction with a potentiostat and a sensitive current meter. The apparatus preferably contains an aqueous assay medium comprising A variety of electrochemical methods exploiting any two of the three parameters potential E , current i and time t may be used to measure the electrochemical characteristics of the components. For example, electrochemical measurements can be made using differental pulse voltammetry, cyclic voltammetry or square ware voltammetry. When cyclic voltammetry is used, a circuit such as, for example, that shown schematically in Figure 1 b of the accompanying drawings may be employed. In this Figure, C represents the auxiliary counter electrode, W the working electrode and R the reference electrode. This circuit may conveniently be used in conjunction with apparatus of the type shown in Figure 1 a , the electochemical current i being measured using a potentiostat. In homogeneous assay systems, the formation of the complex between the ligand and the specific binding partner or, in the case of competitive assays, between the ligand analogue and the specific binding partner, may cause a change e.g. a decrease in the ability of electrons to flow e.g. from the enzyme to the electrode and In a typical homogeneous assay, therefore, formation of the complex perturbs an electrochemical characterisitic of the components of the solution. It is not necessary for a full voltammogram to be determined in measuring the electrochemical characteristic it may be sufficient, for example, for an appropriate poised potential to be selected and readings of current taken at that point. The degree of perturbation can then be related to the amount of ligand present in the sample, from calibration data obtained with similar system using known amounts of ligand. Although the order of introduction of the sample and component s into the apparatus may not be critical, it is preferable that a complex is formed after introduction of the final one of the sample component s but not prior thereto. It is, however, also possible for there to be complex present before the final one of these components is added, in which case the final component will become complexed by displacing one component of the complex. It may be necessary to incubate these components for a period of time to allow the complexing reaction to approach equilibrium before component a is added. Addition of component a should not affect the complexing reaction, but these components must be present before measurements can be taken at the working electrode. The method of the present invention is applicable to e.g. direct assays in which component c is absent , displacement assays or competitive assays in which a ligand analogue is present in component c . The method of the invention may employ the so called sandwich technique, using a solid phase binding partner. Depending on the order of the complexing reactions, the forward, fast forward, reverse and simultaneous variations are all possible according to the present invention. The solid phase may comprise the electrode surface, or may take the form of particles, beads etc. The solid phase binding partner may be prepared by any one of a number of conventional techniques for immobilising reagents onto solid supports. In a method of the invention exploiting the time t parameter, the rate of perturbation of the electrochemical characteristic as a result of complex formation may be determined. Conveniently, the initial rate of perturbation will be measured. Such a method is applicable, for example, to a competitive assay in which the ligand and labelled ligand analogue compete for complexing with the specific binding partner. Thus, the initial rate of perturbation is related to the concentration of ligand present and from a calibration plot the initial rate of perturbation v. concentration of ligand present, the ligand assay can be readily determined. The method of assay involving a determination of the rate of perturbation is also applicable to non competitive assays where the labelled ligand analogue is absent and sufficient labelled specific binding partner is employed to enable all the ligand introduced to be complexed. Measurement of, for example, the absolute electrochemical current generated after a standard incubation period may enhance the ease and sensitivity of the assay. In a typical heterogeneous assay, formation of the complex causes no or only a slight perturbation in an electrochemical characteristic of the components. In that case, it will generally be necessary artifically to generate or enhance a perturbation by controlled external influences. Although the magnitude of the external influence may have some bearing on the change induced, and must therefore be consistent with any such influence employed in calibration experiments, it is thought that any change produced in the perturbation remains a function of the ligand specific binding partner complex. Artificial generation or enhancement of a perturbation may also be desirable in homogeneous assays The solid support may, for example, comprise the electrode surface or may take the form of conventional solid phase particles, beads etc. The solid support may be magnetic or magnetisable to facilitate displacement or separation. Thus, for example, magnetic supports e.g. in the form of particles or beads may be composed of ferromagnetic or paramegnetic materials such as metals e.g. iron, nickel or cobalt , metal alloys e.g. magnetic alloys of aluminium, nickel, cobalt and copper , metal oxides e.g. Fe₃O₄ γ Fe₃O₃, CrO₂, CoO, NiO or Mn₂O₃ , magnetoplumbites or solid solutions e.g. solid solutions of magnetite with ferric oxide . The preferred material for magnetic supports is magnetite Fe₃O₄ or haematite γ Fe₂O₃ . Particles may be non colloidal or colloidal. Displacement of the solid support, may, for example, be effected by urging the support into the vicinity of the electrode. Thus, for example, a magnetic electrode e.g. comprising a permanent magnet or an electromagent may be used, or a non magnetic electrode may be used in which case magnetic supports in form of particles will be urged into and retained in the vicinity of the electrode by the application of an external magnetic field. The component b may be immobilised directly on to the magnetic support, or may be immobilised via one or more other spacer molecules, including partners in specific binding interactions. Immobilisation of reagents may generally be achieved by conventional techniques such as, for example, adsorbtion, covalent bonding or cross linking, or a combination of these techniques, e.g. adsorption of a chemical with one or more functional groups followed by covalent bonding or cross linking of the reagent. Alternatively, substantially non chemical means may be employed. Suitable immobilisation techniques are known in the art. Other methods for artifically generating or enhancing the perturbation include, for example, removing excess uncomplexed labelled reagent, e.g. by draining from the apparatus or by coupling to a suitable solid support and removing the said solid support from the apparatus. All of the variations described above for homogeneous assays including direct, competitive, sandwich and displacement techniques and methods in which a rate of perturbation is measured rather than an absolute perturbation are equally applicable to heterogeneous assays. The methods of the present invention may generally be simpler than known methods, in that they may eliminate the need for separation of uncomplexed and complexed phases before the assaying step. However, as indicated above, the invention also includes within its scope methods in which reagents are employed immobilised on a solid surface, in which methods it may be necessary or desirable to separate the solid complexed and uncomplexed phases before the assaying step. Such separation may take the form of complete removal of the solid phase from the assay medium or may, for example, take the form of sedimentation or concentration of the solid phase in one region of the assay medium. If electrode immobilised components are employed, the need for separate addition of the component to the electrochemical apparatus may be eliminated. Additionally, the direct interaction between the electrode and the electrode immobilised species may lead to an improvement in the sensitivity of the perturbation measurements. According to a further feature of the present invention, therefore, there are provided methods of assay of a ligand in a sample as hereinbefore defined wherein one or more of the components b and, if present, c is are immobilised on the working electrode or a suitable solid surface. The immobilized component s may be bound to the working surface of the working electrode or to a portion of the working electrode other than the working surface. The immobilised component is preferably that component which is labelled. The said component may be immobilised via the label as long as the ability of the label to mediate electron transfer is not impaired. Thus, for example, a polyviologen label may be covalently bonded to a metal electrode. The large polyviologen molecule projects from the electrode surface and this is believed to facilitate interaction with the enzyme. Alternatively, chloranil and or fluoranil may be disseminated throughout an electrode composed of particulate carbon. As a further alternative, a cofactor of an apoenzyme may be immobilised on a carbon electrode, for example by direct binding or by modifying the cofactor and or the electrode. For example, a method of coupling flavin cofactors to carbon electrodes by a Wittig type reaction is described in Biotechnology and Bioengineering Symposium No. 8 1978 483 487. In one embodiment, the system comprises an electrode, e.g. a carbon for example pyrolytic graphite electrode, or a suitable solid surface carrying an immobilised layer of ferrocene dicarboxylic acid, 1,1 dimethylferrocene DMF or polyvinylferrocene having an average molecular weight of about 16000 , the molecules of which are also coupled to reagent b or, if present c , as labels thereof. The carbon electrode core or suitable solid surface can be integral or a stiff paste of particles. Normally, any solid surface employed will present a porous surface for the ferrocene or ferrocene derivative, which may be adhered thereto in a number of ways, for examples Alternatively, the component may be immobilised directly on the solid surface by any of the conventional techniques used for coupling reagents to solid supports. If desired, the electrode immobilised component may be bound to a portion of the electrode other than the working surface. The electrode may in these circumstances be constructed so as to ensure that the immobilised component remains sufficiently close to the working surface to enable the assay to be carried out effectively. Such an electrode is illustrated in vertical cross section in Figure 2 of the accompanying drawings, this being particularly suitable for sandwich immunoassays in which the immobilised component is an unlabelled specific binding partner e.g. a capture antibody . The electrode of Figure 2 comprises an upwardly facing graphite working surface 1 in the base of a cell, the wall of which is formed by a polystyrene projection 2 from the body of the electrode. It is on this wall that a suitable specific binding partner may be immobilised e.g. by adsorption . The electrical connection is provided by an insulated wire 3 secured to the bottom of the working surface by silver loaded epoxy resin 4, the arrangement being encased in epoxy resin 5 and sealed with polypropylene 6. It will be appreciated that, when component b is electrode immobilised, it is not possible artifically to generate or enhance a perturbation by displacement of the resulting complex. However, a perturbation may still be artifically generated or enhanced, for example by complexing any uncomplexed labelled component remaining in solution with a species which will complex specifically with that component, coupled to a solid support, with subsequent displacement of the support and coupled molecules. In a further aspect, the present invention provides kits of reagents and or apparatus for carrying out the assays of the invention. Suitable kits may comprise an electrochemical apparatus containing a working electrode, an auxiliary electrode and optionally a reference electrode, and an aqueous assay medium with suitable components present either in solution or immobilised . Other components e.g. further reagents etc and the sample to be assayed may conveniently be introduced through an entry port provided in the apparatus. The apparatus may be automated so that the components are added in a predetermined sequence, and the incubation temperature may be controlled. Advantageously the apparatus may be pre calibrated and provided with a scale whereby the perturbation in the electrochemical characteristic of the components may be read off directly as an amount of ligand in the sample. Examples of ligands which may be assayed by the method of the invention are given in Table I below, together with an indication of a suitable specific binding partner in each instance. The method of the invention has very broad applicability, but in particular may be used to assay hormones, including peptide hormones e.g. thyroid stimulating hormone TSH , human chorionic gonadotrophin HCG , lutenising hormone LH , follicle stimulating hormone FSH , insulin and prolactin or non peptide hormones e.g. steroid hormones such as cortisol, estradiol, progesterone and testosterone and thyroid hormones such as thyroxine T4 and triiodothyronine , proteins e.g. carcinoembryonic antigen CEA and alphafetoprotein AFP , drugs e.g. digoxin , sugars, toxins or vitamins. The invention will be particularly described hereinafter with reference to an antibody or an antigen as the ligand. However, the invention is not to be taken as being limited to assays of antibodies or antigens. It will be understood that the term antibody used herein includes within its scope The method of preparation of fragments of antibodies is well known in the art and will not be described herein. The term antigen as used herein will be understood to include both permanently antigenic species for example, proteins, bacteria, bacteria fragments, cells, cell fragments and viruses and haptens which may be rendered antigenic under suitable conditions. Incorporation of, for example, a ferrocene label into the molecular structure of an antibody may for example be achieved by any of the following methods Similar methods may be applied as desired for labelling an antigen molecule. Suitable methods are known in the art and will not be discussed in detail here. For example, the incorporation of ferrocene into certain steroids is described in Journal of organometallic Chemistry, Methods of purifying the labelled antibody or antigen are also known and include, for example, dialysis, density gradient ultracentrifugation, gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography. The attachment of the label to the antibody or antigen can be via any portion of the molecular structure of the antibody or antigen, so long as immunological activity thereof is retained. Immobilisation of an antibody or antigen molecule onto the electrode or other suitable solid surface may be effected by various methods. The attachment of the antibody or antigen to the electrode or solid surface can be Thus, for example, electrode immobilisation of unlabelled antibody or antigen reagent may be achieved by bonding interactions between functional groups on the antibody or antigen molecule and the electrode, or by cross linking or adsorption onto the surface of the electrode. Binding of reagents to the electrode may be accomplished by methods analogous to known methods for binding such reagents to solid supports e.g. particles and beads , for example these described in European Patent Application EP A 0105714 Electrode immobilisation of labelled reagent, may, for example, be achieved by any of the following methods The preferred label for use with an enzyme substrate electron source or electron acceptor is ferrocene monocarboxylic acid. When ascorbate is used as an electron source, and a catechol or aminophenol as a label, electrode immobilisation of labelled reagent is preferably achieved by adsorption or chemical reaction via the label on a suitably modified carbon electrode. A discussion of methods of attachment of such species to carbon electrodes is given in Analytical Chemistry, Vol. 55, By way of example only, the invention includes In both these assays the formation of the immune complex decreases the efficacy of the mediator, the change in signal being a measure of antibody concentration. Displacement of mediator antigen complex from the antibody by the antigen under assay results in an increase in signal. The following Examples are intended to illustrate the invention more fully 40 ul of a solution of T4 FMCA 3 x 10 ⁷ molar, in sodium proprionate buffer, 200 mM l, pH 6.0 was added to the electrochemical cell along with 40 µl of glucose a molar solution containing 100mM l of magnesium chloride and 320 µl of Tris HCl buffer 10 mM l, pH 7.4 . After measurement of the electrochemical current, the above experiment was repeated with 20 µl of a solution of glucose oxidase 1 mg of enzyme per ml in water added, but only 300 µl of buffer. Again the electrochemical current was measured. In a third series of experiments, 20 µl of the anti T4 antiserum was added to 40 µl of the T4 FMCA conjugate and 280 µl of the buffer. After an incubation period of 20 minutes, 20 µl of glucose oxidase solution and 40 µl of glucose solution were added and the electrochemical current remeasured. In a fourth series of experiments, 20 µl of a solution of T4 0.5 mM per litre in Tris HLC buffer, 10mM l, pH 7.4 , 20 ul of the anti T4 antiserum, 40 µl of the T4 FMCA conjugate and 260 µl of Tris HCl buffer were mixed and incubated for 20 minutes. After addition of 20 µl of the solution of glucose oxidase and 40 µl of the glucose solution, the electrochemical current was measured. In all cases, the electrochemical current was measured at a temperature of 37 0.5 C and at a voltage scan rate of 5 mV S. The results are presented in Table 1. The results show that the T4 FMCA will act as an electron transfer mediator for glucose oxidase, its ability to mediate being perturbed upon binding with anti T4 antibody. To a stirred cooled 8 C solution of ferrocene monocarboxylic acid 1 mmole in tetrahydrofuran dried , isobutyl chloroformate 1 mmole and triethylamine 1 mmole were added with stirring. The mixture was stirred for thirty minutes and then allowed to warm up to room temperature and stirred for a further hour. The resulting carboxycarbonic anhydride of ferrocene was added dropwise to a cooled 2 C solution of IgG 500 mg in 50 ml of 0.1M sodium bicarbonate solution. The reaction mixture was stirred at 4 C for 24 hours and then dialysed exhaustively against borate buffer pH 8.5. It was spun and gel filtered on S 200 gel.
