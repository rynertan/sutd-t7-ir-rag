# Egg collecting apparatus.

## Abstract
Apparatus for collecting eggs E from a number of poultry cages 21 includes a collector conveyor belt 30 for receiving the eggs E from the cages 21 , and a ramp conveyor belt 40 for de escalating the eggs E from the collector conveyor belt 30 . The cage bottoms are extended to provide a trough in which the collector conveyor belt 30 is carried. Opposite the cages 21 , strips 35 of low friction material act as bumpers to maintain without damage eggs upon the collector conveyor belt 30 . A diagonal fence is provided above the collector ramp belt conveyor junction point to encourage easy, undamaged egg transfer action from the collector conveyor belt 30 to the ramp conveyor belt 40 . Resilient fingers mounted in rows upon the ramp conveyor belt 40 encourage undamaged egg de escalation. An accumulator belt conveyor 60 receives the eggs E from the ramp conveyor belt 40 and carries the eggs E to an accumulation point.
