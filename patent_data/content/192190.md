# Fluorinated polyurethanes containing polyoxyperfluoroalkylene blocks.

## Abstract
Fluorinated polyurethanes, having improved mechanical characteristics and a glass transition temperature lower than 80 C, containing polyoxyperfluoroalkylene blocks deriving from perfluoropolyethers having hydroxylated end groups and or from perfluoropolyethers having isocyanate end groups and furthermore units deriving from an aromatic or a cycloaliphatic diol.
