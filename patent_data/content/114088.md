## Description
PILE FABRIC PRODUCTION PROCESS The present invention relates to a production process for soft pile fabrics. Conventionally so called pile fabrics, obtained by planting short fibres in a base using an adhesive by means of gravity or static electricity, are used for various purposes. Many of them are producible only by applying an adhesive to the base, planting dyed short pile fibre therein, and hardening the adhesive. The pile fibres to be implanted have been limited both in thickness and length. Fine, long fibre piles had been generally difficult to implant. However, it has been proposed to flock separable type composite fibres such as islands in asea type composite fibres or multi core type composite fibres composed of polyester and polyamide and to separate the separable fibres after flocking. By this method a flocked fabric with extremely fine denier touch surface may be obtained. However, the adhesive must be used in great quantities to prevent shedding of the pile fibres.Especially, a large amount of the adhesive and a high bonding strength is necessary when a solvent or a swelling agent is used to separate the pile fibres and when thicker and longer piles are used as in a fur like fabric. Hard texture of the flocked fabric has been one of its important defects. On the other hand, Canadian Patent No. 895611 andU.S. Patent 3,865,678 teach removing one of the fibre component after impregnating an elastomer to make the fabric soft. Further, Canadian Patent No. 167512 teaches the use of raised fabric as the base of a pile fabric.However, even applying such soft fabric as a base of a pile fabric, the resulting pile fabric become hard owing to the large amount of adhesive, which is imparted later to fix the pile fibres firmly. Therefore, said method has not been used for clothing which requires a soft texture. This invention provides a process for producing a soft pile fabric in which the pile fibres are fixed to a fibre base with an adhesive, and in which a part of the base is removed after hardening the adhesive. Through this process, a very soft, highly drapable pile fabric with a high tear strength and with no practical decrease of resistance to shedding of the pile fabric is obtained. It is therefore suitable for clothing which requires softness in particular, as well as for various non clothing uses e.g., seat covers, wall coverings, curtains, bags, and automobile fittings. The effect of the present invention is not limited by the structure of the short pile fibres. Soft, fine short fibre piles, however, ensure a high commodity value, and particularly the ones with less than 1 denier are preferably used. On the other hand, the present invention makes it possible to produce an artificial fur which is soft enough for use of clothing. Figure 1 is a photograph showing a sectional view of a flocked fabric of the present invention, wherein A, B and C are pile fibres, adhesive layer and base fabric.respectively. The pile fabric in accordance with the present invention can be obtained by planting short fibres by electrical flocking or needle punching and raising, and by applying an adhesive. The short fibres to be used may include polyester, polyamide, acrylic and other synthetic fibres rayon and other regenerated fibres and natural fibres but they are not limited thereto. Also, the thickness and length of the short pile fibres to be implanted are not limited. Even superfine fibre piles can be produced through implanting separable fibres. Soft, fine short fibre piles, ensure a high commodity value, and particularly ones with 0.3 to 5.0 mm length and less than 1 denier, especially 0.01 to 0.5denier, are preferably used. In such cases, separable fibres such as islands in sea type fibre or multi core composite fibre whose cores are located at the surface of the fibre are preferably used. Of course, the separable fibres of ordinary denier, are separated after implantation. On the other hand this invention is also preferably applied to an artificial fur, in which, as the guard hair component, both end tapered short fibres of 10 to 200 denier at the body portion and of 20 tO 200 mm length, and as down hair component, short fibres of 0.1 to 5 denier and of 10 to 100 mm length, are preferably used. In the pile fabric produced according to the present invention, the adhesive is left with many narrow continuous spaces which are brought about by removing a part of the fibre base. The continuous narrow spaces make the adhesive layer very soft without reducing the adhesion between the pile fibres and the fibre base. The fibres of the base are, preferably bound with the adhesive in such a way as to leave narrow spaces along the fibre axes allowing relative movement of the fibres on each side of the spaces. This structure is obtained by removing a part of the fibre of the base, such as by dissolving a component of sheath core fibre with a solvent, separating multi core composite fibre with a swelling agent, or removing surface portion of polyester fibre base with an alkali reagent.Especially, the removal of the sea component of islands in sea type composite fibres leaves spaces along the fibre axes and makes movement possible between the individual island fibres and between the fibre bundle and the the portion of adhesion. This is considered to be the reason for the soft texture and high tear strength of the pile fabric produced according to the invention. On the other hand, the bundles themselves are securely held by the adhesive. The base and adhesive therefore do not peel off from each other, i.e., the adhesive impregnates to the base to some extent and, in that portion, surrounds and holds each fibre of the base. The materials and structures of the base are not limited, provided that at least 5 by weight of its component is removable through dissolution or decomposition by an appropriate method. The materials include polyester, polyamide, acrylic and other synthetic fibres rayon and other semi synthetic fibres cellulose, wool and other natural fibres and their mixtures blended during spinning, doubling, weaving or knitting . In terms of the structures, included are various kinds of fabrics, woven, knitted and unwoven fabrics. Method for removing by dissolving or decomposing more than 5 by weight of the base in accordance with the present invention include 1 Dissolution or decomposition of one component of composite filaments, 2 Mixing with the fibre destined ultimately to form the base, a further fibre dissoluble or decomposable by an appropriate method, 3 Use of a fibre which is dissoluble or decomposable from the surface, and 4 Impregnation in the base of more than 5 by weight of a removable material before imparting the adhesive. Methods 1 include those for carrying out the dissolution or decomposition removal and the fining treatment of the pile fibre of an islands in a sea type composite fibre at the same time methods 2 the dissolution or decomposition removal out of the blended fabrics of water and or alkali soluble fibres methods 3 the alkali hydrolysis of polyester and methods 4 the removal of a sizing agent or a resin added to the fabrics. Methods for the dissolution or decomposition removal are not limited to those mentioned above. It is preferable to remove more than 5 by weight of the base by dissolution or decomposition. Otherwise, sufficient softening effect cannot be expected. It is not necessary to fix the upper limit of dissolution or decomposition ratio. It is however preferable to remove less than 60 by weight, particularly less than 40 by weight to ensure sufficient base strength and adequate peel strength of the adhesive layer. The adhesives to be used in the present invention are not limited but are required to withstand the chemicals and conditions to be adopted for the dissolution or decomposition removal of a part of the base. In view of what is described above, the use of islands in a sea type fibres which comprise the same sea component as the fibres of the base and the pile is most preferable for the present invention, since it provides soft texture for flocked fabrics and enables the removal process of the base components and the fining process of the pile components to be effected simultaneously. Furthermore the use of a polyurethane type adhesive is preferable from the standpoint of dissolution resistance treatment and texture. The amount and the penetration depth of the adhesive in the base influence the softness of the fabric. Excess amounts or deep penetration of the adhesive may result in too hard a fabric. Preferably the quantity of the adhesive is 30 to 150 g m2. The penetration depth of the adhesive may be controled by changing the viscosity of the adhesive, coating condition, drying temperature or by pretreatment of the base cloth, such as raising or with water or oil repellant agent. Crumpling of the fabric during or after the dissolution or decomposition removal of the components of base is preferable because it increases the softening effect. In addition the process in accordance with the present invention has been found to improve the tear strength of the flocked fabrics. It is preferable to use an islands in a sea type fibre base that enables removal of a part of the base and fining of the pile to be carried out at the same time. For separable composite fibre bases, where components recovered by peeling off and where the fining does not bring about the removal, only a small softening effect can be obtained thus the softening effect must be attained by another method. Through this process, an exceptionally soft, highly drapable pile fabric with a high tear strength, the implant fibres of which have no practical decrease in resistance to shedding is obtained. It is therefore suitable for clothing which requires softness in particular as well as for various non clothing uses e.g., seat covers, wall coverings, curtains, bags and automobile fittings. The present invention will be described hereinafter in connection with examples.Example 1 and comparative example 1 Pile fibres obtained by cutting to 1.0 mm length an islands in a sea type fibre whose sea and island components are polystyrene and polyethylene terephthalate 4 deniers, sea island ratio 20 80, number of island pieces 16 , respectively, was subjected to 600C x 15 min. scouring in a bath containing 1 g l of a nonionic surface active agent hydroextraction 400C x 20 min. immersion in a bath containing 2 of sodium silicate, 3 of colloidal silica SNOWTEX Cn made by Nissan Kagaku K.K. , and 0.2 of potassium chloride modified to pH4 with acetic acid hydroextraction and drying. The pile was electrostatically implanted voltage 30,000V, distance between electrodes 10mm to 120 g m2 by flocking upwardly after applying a solvent type polyurethane adhesive 25 polyether type polyurethane DMF solution to a needle punch felt base unit weight 200 g m2, thickness lmm of similar islands in a sea type fibre 4 deniers, sea island ratio 30 70, number of islands 36 at a rate of 300 g m2 with a knife coater.The flocked fabric thus obtained was subjected to l000C drying, l300C x 3 min. curing, and immersion in trichloroethylene 3 times at room temperature for removing 29 of the whole fiber base. The flocked fabric thus obtained was much softer than that before the removal of the sea component. It was further subjected to an ordinary method of 1200C dyeing with a liquid flow dyeing machine. The flocked fabric thus obtained became softer and was highly drapable and gave a high grade feeling. It showed a cantilever method softness value of 31mm compared to 140mm immediately after flocking and a high tear strength of 3,500 g mean value of lateral and longitudinal tear strengths . Figure 1 is a scanning type electron microscope photograph of the flocked fabric. It indicates that the monofilament bundles of the base are not completely bonded but have a structure with voids at the section where the adhesive and base are bonded. At the same time, a compar tive example was conducted through a process according to Example 1 except the sea component removal was carried out before flocking. Compared with the Example, the flocked fabric thus obtained was much harder and showed a softness value of 82mm and a tear strength of 1,700 g, which were considerably inferior to the example. As a result of observations with a scanning type electron microscope, it was found that the adhesive haspenetrated into the fibre bundles of the base, with practically no voids in the structure.Example 2 and comparative example 2 A plain weave base weight 14C g m ma e of blended yarn composed of 25 weight of a readily alkali soluble polyester fibre a copolymer of 7 mol of 5 sodium sulphoisophthalate and 93 mol of ethylene telephthalate and 75 weight of ordinary polyethlene telephthalate fibre was subjected to the same manner of flocking as Example 1.The sea component of the pile was removed in trichloroethylene, and the readily alkali soluble polyester in the base was removed with a 3 NaOH solution at 95 OC. Thus 26 weight of the base was removed. The softness of the flocked fabric thus obtained was measured using a cantilever method. At the same time, a comparative example obtained through a process wherein the readily alkali soluble fibres of the base were removed before flocking and then the same manner of flocking as in example 1 was applied. As the result, the flocked fabric made in accordance with the present invention showed a softness of 35mm which was significantly better than that before the removal of the alkali readily removable fibres 135mm and the fabric of the comparative example 95mm .Example 3 A pile was obtained through a process wherein an islands in a sea type fibre 3.5 deniers, sea island ratio 15 85, number of island pieces 6 whose sea and island components were a readily alkali soluble polyester a copolymer of 7 mol of 5 sodium sulphoisophthalate and 93 mol of ethylene terephthalate and polyethylene terephthalate respectively was cut in lmm length and the same manner of electric flocking as Example 1 was applied. Flocking was carried out after applying a solvent type polyurethane binder obtained by adding one part of a diphenylmethane bis 4,4 N, N ethyleneurea bridging agent to a 25 polyether polyurethane DMF solution to a twill fabric base unit weight 130 g m2 whose warp and weft are made from the above said islands in a sea type fibre filament to 300 g m2. The flocked fabric thus obtained was subjected to 1000C drying, 1400C x 2 min. curing, and 800C x 1 hour treatment with a 3 NaOH solution for removing the sea component of the pile and base, and a normal method of 1200C dyeing with a circular liquid flow dyeing machine. The flocked fabric thus obtained was soft and highly drapable and had a high grade feel.Example 4 As a guard hair component, fibres of polybutyleneterephthalate 35 denier, 17 mm length having a flat cruciform cross section large diameter short diameter 2.5 and tapered at both ends were prepared according to the method of U.S. Patent No. 4,381,325, and as a down hair component, fibres of polybutyleneterephthalate 5 denier, 17 mm length having round cross section and tapered at both ends were prepared. The guard hair component was dyed black with Saaron Black BBL liq. 10 towf disperse dye supplied by F.OECHST AG and Samaron Brown 2GSL N 12 owf disperse dye supplied by HOECHST AG at l200C, 60 minutes. The down hair component was dyed dark brown with Miketon Polyester Orange 3 owf supplied by Mitsui Toatsu Kagaku Co. Ltd. , ForonRubine S 2GFL 0.5 owf disperse dye supplied by Sand Co. Ltd. and Sumikalon Blue S BG 1.5 owf disperse dye supplied by Sumitomo Kagaku Co. Ltd. . Equal weight of both component were well mixed by air. As a base, needle punched felt having a weight of 200 g mê composed of islands in sea type fibres 3.5 denier, number of islands 20, thickness of each island 0.1 denier, islands component polyethylene terephthalate, sea component polystyrene was prepared. The mixed hair component was spread uniformly on the base to a weight of 1200 g m2 and implanted in the base by needle punching using needle FPD 1 36 supplied. by Organ Co. Ltd. . Then the under surface of the implanted base was treated with 25 weight of aqueous solution of polyvinylalcohol. After drying the treated surface, the implanted surface was raised and the polyvinylalcohol was removed with hot water at 50 C, and then the fabric was dried. After shearing the hair fibres which protruded under the surface, the under surface of the raised fabric was treated by knife coating with Sunplen LQ T1502 polyurethane solution in dimethyformamide supplied by Sanyo Kasei Co. Ltd. . After that, the polystyrene which constituted a component of the base, was removed with trichloroethylene at room temperature. Next, the fabric was subjected to reduction clearing with NaOH lg l, Na2S2O4 2H2O, lg l, surface active agent lg l at 800C for 30 min. The obtained artificial fur was very soft and looks similar to black mink fur.
