## Description
Field of the invention The present invention relates to curable water based, protective or decorative coating compositions, the methods of making and using same, particularly in cationic electrodepositable compositions. More specifically, the present invention relates to such curable compositions comprising blocked isocyanate crosslinking agents. FR A 2211 542 describes a method for coating the conductive surface of a cathode immersed into an aqueous electrode composable composition. This composition comprises A an organic synthetic self curing resin solubilized by quaternary onium salt groups, comprising hydroxyl groups and blocked isocyanate groups, which is stable at ambient temperature cut reactive with hydroxyl groups at elevated temperature, and B a catalytic amount of a catalyst for urea formation. FR A 2305 514 describes a method for coating the conductive surface of a cathode immersed into an aqueous dispersion of A an organic resin solubilised by a quaternay ammonium salt or a ternary sulfonium salt, whereby the organic resin comprises active hydrogen atoms and is a reaction product of 1 an amine salt and an acid or of a mixture of an acid and a sulfide and 2 a polyepoxide and B a blocked organic polyisocyanate which is stable at ambiant temperature in the presence of said resin A but which is reactive with the active hydrogen atoms of said resin A at an elevated temperature. Curable compositions containing blocked isocyanate crosslinking agents are known in the art. These compositions cure at temperatures of about 177 C 350 F over a period of 20 to 30 minutes. With the advent of energy conservation, however, lower temperature cure has been desirable. Hence, much work has been done to formulate curable compositions that cure effectively at relatively lower temperatures. As is the case here, much work has been done in developping blocked isocyanate crosslinking agents which would aid in effecting lower temperature cure. Consequently, it has been found that proper selection of blocking agents for isocyanato groups of these crosslinking agents results in the formation of crosslinking agents that effect cure at relatively lower temperatures. By the present invention, novel compositions comprising crosslinking agents which can effect cure at relatively lower temperatures have been provided. In accordance with the foregoing, the present invention relates to an ungelled curable water based, protective or decorative coating composition comprising The present invention also encompasses a method of providing a water based, decorative or protective coating for substrates, particularly by electrodeposition. The process comprises 1 applying to the substrate a water based coating composition comprising 2 curing said coating composition. By the term beta hydroxy urethane is meant that the urethane has a hydroxyl group which in the beta position relative to the carbamoxy group. The beta hydroxy urethane has been found to be useful as a crosslinking agent for curable water based coating compositions. Alternately, the beta hydroxy urethane can be used as a self crosslinkable material in providing such protective and or decorative coatings. A clear advantage of the preferred compositions comprising the beta hydroxy urethane resides in their ability to effect cure at relatively lower temperatures, i.e., below 177 C 350 F . The active hydrogen containing polymeric materials have as the active hydrogen group a member selected from the group consisting of hydroxyl, primary amine, secondary amine including imine , thiol and the like. The active hydrogen containing materials useful herein are typically film forming compositions. Illustrative examples of active hydrogen containing materials are polymers such as epoxy polymers, acrylic polymers, polyesters, and the like, which contain active hydrogen groups. Particularly preferred active hydrogen containing materials are those prepared from epoxy materials. The useful epoxy materials are polymeric compounds or mixtures of compounds having and average of more than epoxy groups per molecule. The epoxy materials can be essentially any of the well known epoxides. A particularly useful class of polyepoxides are polyglycidyl ethers of polyphenols such as bisphenol A. These can be produced, for example, by etherification of a polyphenol with epichlorohydrin or dichlorohydrin in the presence of an alkali. The phenolic compound may be, for example, bis 4 hydroxyphenyl 2,2 propane, 4,4 dihydroxybenzo phenone, bis 4 hydroxyphenyl 1,1 ethane, bis 4 hydroxyphenyl 1,1 isobutane, bis 4 hydroxytertiarybutylphenyl 2,2 propane, bis 2 hydroxynaphthyl methane, 1,5 dihydroxynaphthylene, or the like. In many instances it is desirable to employ such polyepoxides having somewhat higher molecular weight and containing aromatic groups. These can be provided by reacting the diglycidyl ether above with a polyphenol such as bisphenol A. Preferably the polyglycidyl ether of a polyphenol contains free hydroxyl groups in addition to epoxide groups. While the polyglycidyl ethers of polyphenols may be employed per se, it is frequently desirable to react a portion of the reactive sites hydroxyl or in some instances epoxy with a modifying material to vary the film characteristics of the resin. Another quite useful class of polyepoxides are produced similarly from novolak resins or similar polyphenol resins. Also suitable are the similar polyglycidyl ethers of polyhydric alcohols which may be derived from such polyhydric alcohols as ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, 1,2 propylene glycol, 1,4 propylene glycol, 1,5 pentanediol, 1,2,6 hexanetriol, glycerol, bis 4 hydroxycyclohexyl 2,2 propane and the like. There can also be used polyglycidyl esters of polycarboxylic acids, which are produced by the reaction of epichlorohydrin or similar epoxy compounds with an aliphatic or aromatic, polycarboxylic acid such as oxalic acid, succinic acid, glutaric acid, terephthalic acid, 2,6 naphthylene dicarboxylic acid, dimerized linolenic acid and the like. Examples are glycidyl adipate and glycidyl phthalate. Also useful are polyepoxides derived from the epoxidation of an olefinically unsaturated alicyclic compound. Included are diepoxides comprising in part one or more monoepoxides. These polyepoxides are non phenolic and are obtained by the epoxidation of alicyclic olefins. For example, by oxygen and selected metal catalysts, by perbenzoic acids, by acetaldehyde monoperacetate, or by peracetic acid. Among such polyepoxides are the epoxy alicyclic ethers and esters which are well known in the art. Other epoxy containing compounds and resins include nitrogeneous diepoxides such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,365,471 epoxy resins from 1,1 methylene bis 5 substituted hydantoin , U.S. Pat. No. 3,391,097 bis imide containing diepoxides, U.S. Pat. No. 3,450,711, epoxylated aminoethyldiphenyl oxides, U.S. Pat. No. 3,312,664 heterocyclic N,N diglycidyl compounds, U.S. Pat. No. 3,503,979 amino epoxy phosphonates, British Pat. No. 1,172,916 1,3,5 triglycidyl isocyanurates, as well as other epoxy containing materials known in the art. An aqueous dispersion of the active hydrogen group containing epoxy polymer is prepared by providing the polymer with a water solubilizing group. Preferably, the water solubilizing group is a cationic group such as an amine salt or an onium group such as quaternary ammonium base group. The amine salts, for example, can be prepared by reacting the epoxy polymer with a primary or secondary amine, followed by neutralizing the resulting amine adduct with an acid. Alternately, a preformed acid salt of the amine, i.e., primary, secondary or tertiary amine salt, can be reacted with the epoxy polymer. The beta hydroxy urethane can be prepared by reacting i.e., blocking an isocyanato compound or polymer hereinafter isocyanate with a 1,2 polyol or with a combination of a 1,2 polyol and a conventional blocking agent. In this context, the term 1,2 polyol denotes a compound containing at least two vicinal hydroxyl groups. The term conventional blocking agent denotes a compound which reacts with an isocyanate to form a blocked isocyanate crosslinking agent which does not effect appreciable cure below 177 C 350 F . The isocyanates useful herein can be monoisocyanates or polyisocyanates. Illustrative of the monoisocyanates are ethylenically unsaturated polymerizable monomers containing an isocyanato group. Illustrative of these monoisocyanates are isocyanato alkyl esters of ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids such as vinyl isocyanates, allyl isocyanates, allyloxyalkyl isocyanates and sturyl isocyanates. Representative examples are 2 isocyanato ethyl acrylate, 2 isocyanato ethyl methacrylate, propenyl isocyanate, and 9 decenyl isocyanate. The polyisocyanates useful herein can be aliphatic or aromatic isocyanates with the aromatic isocyanates being preferred. Representative examples are the aliphatic isocyanates such as trimethylene, tetramethylene, pentamethylene, hexamethylene, 1,2 propylene, 1,2 butylene, 2,3 butylene, and 1,3 butylene diisocyanates the cycloalkylene compounds such as 1,3 cyclopentane, 1,4 cyclohexane, 1,2 cyclohexane diisocyanates and isophorone diisocyanates the aromatic compounds such as m phenylene, p phenylene, 4,4 diphenyl, 1,5 napthalene and 1,4 naphthalene diisocyanates the aliphatic aromatic compounds such as 4,4 diphenylene methane, 2,4 or 2,6 tolylene, or mixtures thereof, 4,4 toluidine, and 1,4 xylylene diisocyanates the nuclear substituted aromatic compounds such as dianisidine diisocyanate, 4,4 diphenylether diisocyanate and chlorodiphenylene diisocyanate the triisocyanates such as triphenyl methane 4,4 ,4 triisocyanate 1,3,5 triisocyanate benzene and 2,4,6 triisocyanate toluene and the tetraisocyanates such as 4,4 dimethyldiphenyl methane 2,2 ,5,5 tetraisocyanate the polymerized polyisocyanates such as tolylene diisocyanate dimers and trimers, and the like. In addition, the organic polyisocyanate may be a prepolymer derived from a polyol including polyether polyol or polyester polyol, including polyols which are reacted with excess polyisocyanates to form isocyanate terminated prepolymers. These may be simple polyols such as glycols, e.g., ethylene glycol and propylene glycol, as well as other polyols such as glycerol, trimethylolpropane, hexanetriol, pentaerythritol, and the like, as well as mono ethers such as diethylene glycol, tripropylene glycol and the like and polyethers, i.e., alkylene oxide condensates of the above. Among the alkylene oxides that may be condensed with these polyols to form polyethers are ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, butylene oxide, styrene oxide and the like. These are generally called hydroxy terminated polyethers and can be linear or branched. Examples of polyethers include polyoxyethylene glycol having a molecular weight of 1540, polyoxypropylene glycol having a molecular weight of 1025, polyoxytetramethylene glycol, polyoxyhexamethylene glycol, polyoxynonamethylene glycol, polyoxydecamethylene glycol, polyoxydodecamethylene glycol and mixtures thereof. Other types of polyoxyalkylene glycol ethers can be used. Especially useful polyether polyols are those derived from reacting polyols such as ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, 1,4 butylene glycol, 1,3 butylene glycol, 1,6 hexanediol, and their mixtures glycerol, trimethylolethane, trimethylolpropane, 1,2,6 hexanetriol, pentaerythritol, dipentaerythritol, tripentaerythritol, polypentaerythritol, sorbitol, methyl glucosides, sucrose and the like with alkylene oxides such as ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, their mixtures, and the like. As afore stated, in preparing the beta hydroxy urethane, a 1,2 polyol or a combination of the 1,2 polyol and a conventional blocking agent is reacted with the isocyanate. Typically, the 1,2 polyols are of low molecular weight, ranging from about 62 to 286. Representative examples of the 1,2 polyols are ethylene glycol, 1,2 propylene glycol, 1,2 butanediol, 1,2 hexanediol and hydrolyzed butyl glycidyl ether. While higher molecular weight polyols are not generally used, they can be employed preferably in combination with the low molecular weight 1,2 polyols. The conventional blocking agent in accordance with this invention can be aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic alkyl monoalcohol, for example, lower aliphatic alcohols, such as methyl, ethyl, chloroethyl, propyl, butyl, amyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, 3,3,5 trimethylhexyl, decyl and lauryl alcohols and the like cycloaliphatic alcohols such as cyclopentanol and cyclohexanol and aromatic alkyl such as phenyl carbinol. In preparing the beta hydroxy urethane as described herein, the isocyanate and the 1,2 polyol are reacted in such a proportion that no free, or virtually no free isocyanate groups are present in the resultant product. Preferably, they are reacted in such a proportion that the equivalent ratio of OH of the 1,2 polyol to that of free NCO group of the isocyanate is 2 to 1 and preferably 1.5 to 1. When a conventional blocking agent is used in combination with the 1,2 polyol, the combination of blocking agents and the isocyanate is typically reacted in such a proportion that the conventional blocking agent is used in an amount which is not more than twice the amount of the 1,2 polyol. To obtain the beta hydroxy urethane, it is recommended that the isocyanate be added slowly to the 1,2 polyol or the combination thereof. Upon completion of the addition, the reaction mixture is allowed to react over a temperature range of 80 to 120 C, until all or virtually all of the free isocyanate is reacted. A catalyst is usually employed in preparing the beta hydroxy urethane. Catalysts useful herein are those suitable for urethane formation. They are, preferably, metal salts or complexes, for example, lead acetate, dibutyltin dilaurate, stannous octoate and the like. Other catalysts for urethane formation may also be employed. A solvent is usually employed in preparing the beta hydroxy urethane. Solvents that are non reactive with isocyanates are preferred, e.g., ketones, e.g., methyl isobutyl ketone, ethers such as diethyl ether of ethylene glycols, or esters such as ethyl acetate. The beta hydroxy urethane can be external or internal as to the active hydrogen containing material. By the term external herein is meant that the beta hydroxy urethane does not constitute an integral part of the active hydrogen containing material. By the term internal herein is meant the active hydrogen containing material is an integral part of the active hydrogen containing material. As set forth herein, the curable composition comprises a cure catalyst. Typically, the cure catalyst is a metal salt and or complex of a metal such as lead, zinc, iron, tin and manganese. Suitable salts of these metals are, for example, octoates and naphthanates. A suitable complex is, for example, acetyl acetonate. The cure catalyst is used in amounts sufficient to effect cure at the relatively low temperatures described herein. For example, the metal salt and or complex is employed as a cure catalyst in amounts of about 01 to 2.0, preferably 0.2 to 1 percent metal by weight solids based on the weight of the curable composition. The cure catalyst can be mixed simultaneously with other starting materials for the preparation of the coating composition, or introduced into the coating composition in any order that is convenient. In the practice of the invention, the curable compositions are water based coating compositions. Coating compositions comprising aqueous dispersions are particularly suited to application by electrodeposition, although they may be applied by conventional non electrophoretic coating techniques. The term dispersion as used herein, is intended to cover solutions and colloidal suspensions, as well. Generally, the aqueous dispersion may contain from about 1 to 75 percent by weight resin. In most instances, a pigment composition and, if desired, various additives such as anti oxidants, surface active agents, coupling solvents and the like known in the electrodeposition art are included. The pigment composition may be of any conventional type, comprising, for example, one or more pigments such as iron oxides, lead oxides, strontium chromate, carbon black, titanium dioxide, talc, barium sulfate, cadmium yellow, cadmium red, chromic yellow, or the like. In electrodeposition processes employing the aqueous coating compositions described above, the aqueous composition is placed in contact with an electrically conductive anode and an electrically conductive cathode with the surface to be coated being the cathode. Upon passage of electric current between the anode and the cathode, while in contact with the bath containing the coating composition, an adherent film of the coating composition is deposited on the cathode. The conditions under which the electrodeposition is carried out are, in general, similar to those used in electrodeposition of other types of coatings. The applied voltage may be varied greatly and can be, for example, as low as one volt or as high as several thousand volts, although typically between 50 volts and 500 volts. The current density is usually between about 1.0 ampere and 15 amperes per square foot, and tends to decrease during electrodeposition. The method of the invention is applicable to the coating of any electrically conductive substrate, and especially metals such as steel, aluminum, copper or the like. After deposition, the coating is cured at elevated temperatures by any convenient method such as in baking ovens or with banks of infrared heat lamps. Relatively low baking temperatures are employed in curing the films derived from the preferred embodiments of this invention. At temperatures as low as 121 C 250 F , appreciable cure is obtained. At temperatures of about 163 C 325 F , excellent cure is obtained. It has been found that the preferred embodiments of the invention which cure at the relatively lower temperatures are derived from aromatic isocyanates. Of course, cure can be obtained at higher temperatures of about 260 C 500 F to 316 C 600 F however, it is a distinct feature of this invention that excellent cures are obtained at 163 C 325 F . The particularly preferred crosslinking agents of this invention possess a desirable feature of imparting desirable film properties such as flow and surface smoothness. Illustrative examples of the preferred crosslinking agents are those comprising blocked isocyanates wherein the blocking agent is hydrolyzed butyl glycidyl ether. It is noteworthy that, in some instances, film properties can be improved by combining the 1,2 polyol blocking agents with conventional blocking agents which are known to impart these film properties. This and other aspects of the invention are further illustrated by the following non limiting examples. In the following examples, the crosslinking agents were prepared, and in some of the examples they were blended with active hydrogen containing materials so as to form curable compositions. The curable compositions were applied to substrates to form films which were baked and evaluated for their ability to cure at relatively low temperatures. A crosslinking agent comprising a 1,2 polyol blocking agent was prepared as follows A reaction vessel equipped with a stirrer, a thermometer, a gas inlet fitting, a condenser and an addition funnel was charged with the diisocyanate and a nitrogen blanket was begun. The trimethylolpropane was dissolved in the 210.7 grams of methyl isobutyl ketone with heating and charged to a warm addition funnel. The triol solution was added to the diisocyanate over 30 minutes while maintaining the temperature of the reaction mixture between 36 and 38 C with an ice bath as needed . After completion of the addition, the reaction mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for 45 minutes. During this time, a second reaction vessel equipped in the same manner as described above was charged with the 75.0 grams of methyl isobutyl ketone and the hydrolyzed butyl glycidyl ether. This mixture was heated to 62 C. The isocyanatetrimethylolpropane adduct solution was charged to the addition funnel and added to the mixture over one hour while maintaining the temperature between 63 and 67 C. The dibutyltin dilaurate was added to the resulting mixture and the temperature was increased to 121 C, followed by refluxing for about 2 hours. A sample of the reaction mixture was removed, analyzed by infrared spectroscopy and revealed no isocyanate peak. The resultant product comprising the blocked isocyanate crosslinking agent had a solids content of 68.7 percent. An active hydrogen group containing material was prepared as follows. The Epon 828, PCP 0200 and xylene were charged to a reaction vessel and heated under a nitrogen blanket to 210 C. The reaction was held at reflux for about 1 2 hour to remove water. The reaction mixture was cooled to about 155 C, followed by adding the bisphenol A and holding the reaction mixture for about 1 2 hour to dissolve the bisphenol A. Thereafter, at 151 C, there was added to the reaction mixture the 2.0 grams of benzyldimethylamine with a resulting exotherm and a temperature rise to 182 C. The reaction mixture was allowed to cool to 130 C, at which temperature, the 4.3 grams of the benzyldimethylamine catalyst was added and the resulting mixture held at 130 C until a reduced Gardner Holdt viscosity of P Q was obtained. Measured by using 50 percent non volatile solution of a sample of the resulting mixture in ethylene glycol monoethyl ether . The diketimine derivative and the N methylethanolamine were then added and the temperature of the reaction mixture brought to 110 C and held at this temperature for 1 hour. Finally, the methyl isobutyl ketone and n butanol were added to the mixture. The resultant product comprising the film former had a solids content of 64.8 percent. The above crosslinking agent and an active hydrogen group containing material were blended and dispersed in water to form a curable composition, in the following manner. The deionized water was slowly added to a blend of the film former, crosslinker and lactic acid to produce an aqueous dispersion having a solids content of 44.6 percent. This example illustrates the crosslinking agents comprising a combination ofthe 1,2 polyol and conventional blocking agents, and curable compositions comprising same. The crosslinking agent was prepared as follows. A reaction vessel equipped with a stirrer, a thermometer, a gas inlet fitting, a condenser and an additional funnel was charged with the diisocyanate and a nitrogen blanket was begun. The trimethylolpropane was dissolved in the 132.5 grams of methyl isobutyl ketone with heating and charged to a warm addition funnel. The triol solution was added to the diisocyanate over 30 minutes while maintaining the temperature of the reaction mixture between 30 and 41 C with an ice bath as needed . After completion of the addition, the reaction mixture was allowed to react over a temperature range of 44 to 52 C for 45 minutes. During this time, a second reaction vessel equipped in the same manner as described above was charged with the 49.0 grams of methyl isobutyl ketone, the hydrolyzed butyl glycidyl ether and the 2 ethylhexanol. This mixture of blocking agents was heated to 60 C under a nitrogen blanket. The isocyanate trimethylolpropane adduct solution was charged to the addition funnel and added to the mixture of blocking agents over one hour while maintaining the temperature between 61 and 67 C. About 15 minutes after the addition was complete, the dibutyltin dilaurate was added and the temperature was increased to 120 C and held there until a sample removed and analyzed by infrared spectroscopy revealed no isocyanate peak. The resultant product, comprising the blocked isocyanate crosslinking agent, had a solids content of 73.7 percent. An aqueous dispersion comprising the above crosslinking agent, and film former which was the same as described in Example IB, was prepared, in the same manner as described in Example IC. The following were used. The resultant aqueous dispersion had a solids content of 37.9 percent. A conventional crosslinking agent comprising a conventional blocking agent was prepared, blended with a film former, and evaluated for its ability to cure. The preparation was as follows. A reaction vessel equipped with a stirrer, a thermometer, a gas inlet fitting, a condenser and an addition funnel was charged with the diisocyanate and a nitrogen blanket was begun. The trimethylolpropane was dissolved in the 188.1 grams of methyl isobutyl ketone with heating and charged to a warm addition funnel. The triol solution was added to the diisocyanate over 30 minutes while maintaining the temperature of the reaction mixture between 38 and 41 C with an ice bath as needed . After completion of the addition, the reaction mixture was held over a temperature range of 44 to 55 C for about 30 minutes. During this time, a second reaction vessel equipped with the same manner as described above was charged with the 111.9 grams of methyl isobutyl ketone and the 2 ethylhexanol. The isocyanate trimethylolpropane adduct solution was charged to the addition funnel and added to the 2 ethylhexanol mixture over a period of about one hour while maintaining the temperature between 61 and 67 C. About 15 minutes after the addition was complete, the dibutyltin dilaurate was added and the temperature was increased to 120 C and held there until a sample removed and analyzed by infrared spectroscopy revealed no isocyanate peak. The resultant product comprising the blocked isocyanate crosslinking agent had a solids content of 71.5 percent. An aqueous dispersion comprising the above crosslinking agent, and a film former which was the same as described in Example IB, was prepared in the same manner as described in Example IC. The following were used in the preparation. The resultant aqueous dispersion had a solids content of 38.6 percent. This example further shows the preparation of the crosslinking agents of the present invention. The following were used in the preparation. A reaction vessel equipped with a stirrer, a thermometer, a gas inlet fitting, a condenser, an addition funnel and a Dean Stark trap filled with methyl isobutyl ketone was charged with the 1,2 butanediol and the methyl isobutyl ketone. Under a nitrogen blanket, the reaction mixture was heated to reflux for about 30 minutes. The reaction temperature having risen to 124 C was cooled to 95 C and the dibutyltin dilaurate was added. The reaction temperature was cooled to 90 C, followed by adding the Mondur TD80 over a period of 45 minutes. Following this addition, the reaction mixture was heated to 110 C and held at this temperature for about one hour until all of the free isocyanate had been reacted. The resultant product comprising the blocked isocyanate had a solids content of 65.1 percent. This example also shows the preparation of the crosslinking agents of the present invention in essentially the same manner as described in Example III. The following were used in the preparation. The resultant product comprising the crosslinking agent had a solids content of 77.2 percent. This example shows the preparation of the crosslinking agents comprising 1,2 polyol blocking agents in essentially the same manner as described in Example III. The following were used in the preparation The resultant product comprising the crosslinking agent had a solids content of 72.7 percent. Coating compositions of Examples I, II and Comparative Example were formulated with dibutyltin oxide cure catalyst at 0.33 percent tin metal based on total solids weight of the composition. The formulation comprised preparing a paste of the catalyst by grinding the catalyst with a resinous grinding vehicle to about a Hegman 7 grind. U.S. Patent 4,007,154 note Example II discloses the grinding vehicle in nature and method of preparation and is incorporated herein by reference. The resulting paste comprises 30 percent dibutyltin oxide, 12 percent grinding vehicle and the remainder solvent. The paste was mixed thoroughly with the coating compositions and the resulting dispersions were stirred at room temperature for three days to permit the methyl isobutyl ketone and n butanol to escape. Panels of substrates were electrocoated at about 100 volts for one minute at a bath temperature of 24 C 75 F in aqueous dispersions of the above coatings at 15 percent resin solids, baked and evaluated to determine degree of cure at varying temperatures. The degree of cure was measured by the number of acetone double rubs required to remove the baked film. The condition of the evaluation and the results obtained were as reported below.
