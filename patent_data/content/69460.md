# Dual stacker for slot acceptor.

## Abstract
A dual stacker for slot acceptors, capable of receiving and separately stacking securities of at least two denomina tions. The invention includes a receptacle beneath the note path of a slot acceptor. A punch plate is operative for reciprocating movement through such receptacle. On each side of the receptacle are stacking plates, one for each denomination of bill to be handled. When a bill is sensed as being valid, and a determination is made as to the denomina tion of the bill, the punch plate is appropriately positioned on one side of the receptacle or the other. The bill is then dropped into the receptacle and the punch plate passed therethrough to move the bill on to the appropriate stack. The invention also includes bill retaining bars to prevent the bills from springing outwardly from the stacks. These bars are removable for easy access to the stacks by an operator.
