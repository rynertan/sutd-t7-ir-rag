## Description
A radial bearing. The invention relates to a radial bearing comprising a shaft having a helical groove at least one flank of which is at a small angle with the axis of said shaft, the opening of the angle pointing in the direction of rotation and in the direction of pitch and which shaft is supported in a stationary cylindrical bush. Such a bearing design is known for instance from the Dutch Patent Specification 65.303. According to this known bearing design the shaft is rotating in a metal bush. Upon rotation the wedge shaped space formed by the small angle operative in both the circumferential direction and the axial direction provides for the formation of a lubricant wedge whereby the metal metal contact is prevented.This known bearing presents the drawback that the wedge angle is too large for the buildup of a hydrodynamic lubricating film on the cylindrical part and that when at stand still a high specific pressure per surface unit occurs due to which the lubricating properties are bad upon starting up. Such a bearing may consequently be subject to serious wearing phenomena due to thus caused erosion. Even under a normal load no proper lubrication may be achieved by means of this too large a wedge angle. The object of the invention is to provide a bearing design not exhibiting these drawbacks. According to the invention this object is achieved in that the bush consists of an elastomeric material. Due to the load and the compression of the elastomeric bush caused thereby there will be formed very small wedge angles between the flanks of the groove and the surface of the bush whereby upon starting the rotation there will immediately be formed a lubricating film due to the formation of a very small angle between the flank and the bush. In accordance with the invention both flanks of the groove may furthermore be at essentially the same though opposite angles with the axis. Thus it is achieved that the bearing is suitable for both directions of rotation. It should be noted that it is known to use elastomeric materials in bearings utilizing water as the lubricant, in which bearing a smooth cylindrical shaft is supported by a bearing of elastomeric material, said bearing being composed of rods running in axial direction the effective surface of which rods somewhat tangents to the surface of the shaft. An example thereof has been shown in theU.S.Patent Specification 1,885,339. The invention will now be elucidated in further detail with respect to the drawings, in which Fig. 1 diagrammatically shows a longitudinal section through the bearing according to the invention, Fig. 2 represents a cross section along the line Il Il in Fig.1, and Figs. 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 diagrammatically show several profiles of the shaft in accordance with the bearing design of the invention. The bearing shown in Figs. 1 and 2 consists of a shaft 1, a metal bush 2 and a cylindrical bush 3 of elastomeric material, for instance rubber, supported by the metal bush. The shaft 1 is provided with a helical groove having a steeply sloping flank 5 and a but slightly sloping flank 6. This flank 6 is at a very small angle with the axis of the shaft and consequently with the surface of the bush 3. This angle is in the axial direction and has been indicated in Fig. 1 by a. When viewed in the circum ferential direction this angle becomes smaller like has been indicated in Fig. 2 by ss. The flanks 5 and 6 determining the groove constitute a cavity that cannot be filled by the loaded elastomeric material. Under the influence of the rotation there is formed an elastohydrodynamic lubricating film extending from the rising flank 6 upto the next groove. This flank 6 should therefore have a small angle of inclination ss. The direction of rotation of the shaft runs like indicated by the arrow 10. Like shown in Fig. 1 the elastomeric bush 3 is locked between the inwardly projecting end flanges of the metal bush 2. Such a locking in the axial direction is necessary because the helical groove will exert a propulsive action on the elastomeric material in the axial direction during rotation. These end flanges project inwardly that far that they will not yet extend into the radial deformation range of the elastomeric bush, that is to say that they will remain outside the area in which the bush is deformed in stationary condition or in motion, respectively. In tangential direction this small angle of inclination yields in combination with the pitch angle of the groove a yet smaller angle which together with the elastic deformation of the elastomeric bush yields a very small wedge angle in which the hydrodynamic build up of pressure of the liquid occurs. The hydrodynamic pressure course in the lubricating film in the axial direction has been indicated in Fig. 1 by the curve 7 and inFig. 2 for the radial direction by the curve 8. In the idle condition the elastomeric bush will be deformed in a way like indicated in Figs. 1 and 2 that is to say that the groove will almost entirely be filled with the elastomeric material. It has however been indicated clearly, that there will remain a wedge shaped space 15, 16. Upon rotation there will occur a displacement of this deformation in the circumferential direction and in the axial direction. Such change cannot quickly be followed by an elastomeric material responding slowly like a liquid material thus causing the filling of the groove to become less so that in other words the wedge angle becomes smaller. This wedge angle does however never become smaller than the angles a and B, respectively. The change in wedge angle however assures an adaptation of the lubrication to all circumstances varying from idle condition to maximum number of revolutions. Where in the bearing according to the invention the grooves are provided in the rotating part there will occur an effective cooling of the running surface because at the location where loading occurs and where frictional heat will be generated there will take place a continuous renewal of the lubricating liquid. This cooling lubricating liquid will thereby automatically and continuously be replenished. Contaminations will moreover be removed continuously. When it is desired to further improve upon the cooling and or the flushing such may be acquired by providing an additional groove 9 like indicated in the Figs. 6 and 7. With reference to Fig. 3 there is shown the same profile like inFig. 1 in which however between the rising flanks 6 there has been arranged a cylindrical part 11. The intensity of the cooling is dependent on the number of threads passing per one revolution. By in serting a more or less broad cylindrical part 11 one may influence among others the degree of cooling. Figs. 4 and 5 show a groove in which both the flanks 12 and 13 incline under the same small angle though in opposite directions. In Fig.5 there is inserted again a cylindrical part 14. This embodiment is suitable for both directions of rotation Fig. 6 shows the embodiment of Fig. 1 including the additional conveying groove 9 whereas Fig. 7 shows the embodiment of Fig. 5 likewise provided with an additional conveying groove 9. The left hand or the right hand winding of the helical line is determined by the direction of conveyance which is desired for the pertaining bearing. The nature of the lubricating agent is dependent on the stability of the materials used. Quite different materials are conceivable.Water however is preferred.
