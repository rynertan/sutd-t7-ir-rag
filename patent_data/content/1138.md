## Description
BACKGROUNDThis invention relates to lithographic printing and more particularly to the preparation of lithograpic printing plates using non silver halide techniques.Lithographic printing techniques, using, for example, aluminum base plates such as described in Fromson patent US 3,181,461 issued May 4, 1965, have come into wide use in the printing industry and especially in offset lithographic printing and direct lithographic printing by newspaper using converted letterpress printing presses.Time is often a factor in making lithographic printing plates and this is especially critical in the case of newspapers. The present day technique involves making a full size photographic negative of a paste up of each page for the newspaper and then exposing a wipe on or pre sensitized lithographic plate through the negative followed by developing after which the plate is ready for mounting on the printing press. This process is time oonsumlng and becomes even less efficient where duplicate plates are required for a multiple press operation which is common in the newspaper industry.In order to disprove the time element involved in making lithographic printing plates it has been proposed to eliminate the use of a light sensitive lithographic substrate, such as a diazo resin coated anodized aluminum substrate, and to instead directly reproduce the printing surface on the substrate using elect tatic techniques and laser transfer techniques. USPatent 2,862,815 issued December 2, 1958 describes a direct reproduction process using electrostatic techniques and USPatents 2,962,513 issued June 8, 1976 and 3,964,389 issuedJune 22, 1976 describe laser transfer techniques for forming the printing surface on a substrate.However, these proposals have not met with much success because the printing surface formed using these direct reproduction techniques lacks the integrity and durability required for good quality, dependable lithographic printing In other words, these proposals have failed to come up to the quality and durability standards available from conventional photochemical materials used in presensitized and wipe on printing plates, for example diazo resins.Another proposal is set forth in US Patent 3,578,451 issuedMay 11, 1971 and involves applying a conventional photographic emulsion over the diazo coating on a lithographic substrate.The phtographic emulsion coating is exposed to form an in situ fugitive negative which is later removed after or during deve lopment of the diazo printing surface. This proposal, however, utilizes conventional photographic techniques and suffers from drawbacks associated therewith. For example substrates prepared in this fashion must be prepared, stored and handled under darkroom conditions and this only adds rather than subtracts from the procedures to be followed by the lithographic plate maker. SUMMARYThe present invention provides a photographic method for making high quality dependable lithographic printing plates in a highly efficient manner. The present invention makes it possible to employ conventional sensitized lithographic substrates for example pre sensitized or wipe on printing plates and relies on the use of more advanced techniques for foriiting a fugitive negative over the sensitized substrate.The process according to the present invention for making a lithographic printing plate thus includes the steps of a providing a sensitized lithographic substrate having a photochemical coating thereon that has its solubility altered upon exposure to actinic radiation b depositing on selected portions of the sensitized substrate a layer of a non silver halide material that is opaque to the actinic radiation that will alter the solubility of the photochemical coating c exposing the sensitized substrate to actinic radiation to alter the solubility characteristics of the uncovered portions of the photochemical coating and d . dissolving away the soluble portions of the photochemical coating.Step b above involves the formation of a fugitive negative on the sensitized substrate and this can be accomplished according to preferred embodiments of the invention using electrostatic and laser transfer techniques. DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGThe present invention will be more fully understood from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawing wherein Fig. 1 is a cross sectional diagrammatic view illustrating one embodiment of the present invention Fig. 2 is a cross sectional diagrammatic representation of a lithographic printing plate formed according to the embodiment illustrated in Fig. 1 Figs.3 5 are cross sectional diagrammatic representations illustrating another embodiment of the invention utilizing laser transfer techniques and Figs.6 and 7 are cross sectional diagrammatic representations of lithographic printing plates formed according to the embodiment illustrated in Figs. 3 5. DESCRIPTIONFig. 1 of the drawing provides a simple illustration of the present invention wherein a substrate 10 for example anodized aluminum is provided with a photochemical layer or coating 12 that has its solubility altered upon exposure to actinic radiation, for example a coating of diazo resin. A non silver halide opaque mask or fugitive negative 14 is deposited on selected portions of the sensitized substrate. The mask 14 is opaque to actinic radiation that will alter the solubility of the photochemical coating 12. After depositing the mask 14, the uncovered portions of the photochemical coating 12 are exposed to actinic radiation which in this illustration is a source of ultra violet radiation as shown in Fig. 1. This alters the solubility characteristics of the photochemloal layer 12 in those portions left uncovered by the mask 14.In the embodiment shown in Figs. 1 and 2, a negative working diazo resin is employed which becomes insoluble in those areas which see the UV light, that is the portions not covered by the mask 14. In developing the exposed sensitized substrate, the opaque mask 14 is removed and the underlying unexposed and still soluble portions of the diazo resin coating are also removed using conventional developing techniques. The plate shown in Fig. 2 results with an insoluble diazoresin in the image areas of the plate.Figs. 3 through 7 illustrate another embodiment of the invention wherein a laser transfer technique is employed with a positive acting diazo resin. A laser transparent film 16 having thereon a laser responsive coating 18 is placed face down on the sensitized substrate which is made up of the substrate 10 and the photochemical layer 12. A laser is employed to transfer portions of the laser responsive coating 18 from the film 16 onto the photochemical layer 12 resulting in the fugitive negative 14 Fig. 4 . Using known techniques, a so called reading laser causes the so called writing laser to transfer the laser coating 18 in the image areas illustrated by reference numeral 14 . Exposure to a W source of light as shown in Fig. 5 causes the uncovered portions of the photochemical layer 12 to become solubilized in the case of a positive working diazo resin.The solubilized portions of the photochemical layer are then removed by conventional developing techniques lea ing an in so luble image area which still carries the transferred fugitive negative 14 . If desired the transferred portions of the laser coating 18 14 in Fig. 6 can be removed leaving the developed plate as shown in Fig. 7. It ahould u derstood that the Laée t anstat With the postons 1a Fig. 4 ramaining after the asfor operation oen be used with a nagative workian diaze r negative itself to prooucs duplicate lithograyhio plates,The lithographie substrate is preferably su modized and treated aluminum substrate such as deseribed in Fromson ants US 3, 181,461 and US 3,280,73 . Tempered aluminym is gene ly used o make lithographic subscrates which are suitanle use un the present invention. empered al m gesera a temper rating of between 12 and 19 where dirent raduction is employed or between H 22 and H 27 Whe natron of cold reduction and back annealldas are empio the Am ericar Aluminum Association publication entit ed Al ninumStandards and Data.The censitized lithographic substrate used in the invent on can be made in a number of ways known in the art for exa ple as taught by the following patents US 2,71 ,066 Jewitt et al July 26, 1955 US 2,741,981 Frost April 17, 1956 US 2,797,504 Plambeck May 7, 1957 US 3,062,648 Grawford Ncvember 6,19 US 3,220,346 Strickler Novemher 30, 1965 US 3,338, 164 Webers August 29, 1967A preferred substrate is an anodically oxidired aluminum ember which is treated after anodizing with an alkali metal silieate and sealed prior to being sensitized. This is described . greater detail in Fromson patent US 2 181,461 refered to previosly.It is prefexred to continuously anodize aluminum for the preferred aluminum substrate utilizing the anodizing techn ques described an Fromson patents US ,865,700 issued February 11, 1975 and US 3,920,525 issued November 18, 1975. If desired, the aluminum substrate can be provided with a composite anodized and disc S inuously electroplated surface prior to application of the photochemical layer as described in greater detail in Fromson patent US 3, 929,594 issued December 30, 1975.As mentioned above, the photochemical layer 12 can be negative working or positive working. Negative working light sensitive materials are of such a nature that before exposure to actinic radiation they are soluble in a particular solvent usually water . When exposed to actinic radiation, however, the material becomes insoluble in the solvent. Positive working light sensitive materials function just the opposite, that is, they are insoluble and become soluble upon exposure to actinic radiation.Thus, for purposes of the present invention, the light sensitive material forming the photochemical layer 12 on the lithographic substrate 10 has one solubility in relation to a solvent in a state bevore expsure to actinic radiation and another solubility in relation to said solvent in another state after exposure to actinic radiation, the light sensitive material being soluble in said solvent in one of said states and being insoluble in said solvent in its other state.The light sensitive material formingihe photochemical layer 12 can be formed from a host of photochemical materials known in the art. Such light sensitive materials include dichromated colloids, such as those based on organic colloids, gelatin, process glue, albumens, caseins, natural gums, starch and its derivatives, synthetic resins, such as polyvinyl alcohol and the like unsaturated compounds such as those based on cinnamic acid anE its derivatives, chalcone type compounds, stilbene compounds and the like and photopolymerizable compositions, a wide variety of polymers including vinyl polymers and copolymers such as polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl acetals, polyvinyl acetate vinyl sorbate, polyvinyl ester acetal, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyvinyl butyrol, halogenated polyvinyl alcohol cellulose based polymers such as cellulose acetate hydrogenphthalate, cellulose alkyl ethers ureaformaldehyde resins polyamide condensation polymers polyethylene oxides polyalkylene ethers, polyhexamethylene adipamide polycholorophene polyethylene glycols, and the like. Such compositions utilize as initiators carbonyl compounds, organic sulphur compounds, peroxides, redox systems, azo und diazo compounds, halogen compounds and the like. These and other photochemical materials including their chemistry and uses are discussed in detail in a text entitled Light Sensitive Systems, Jaromir Kosar,John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York, 1965. Diazo resins are particularly preferred.As used herein, the terms soluble and insoluble are intended to convey the meaning generally accepted and understood in the art of exposing and developing images using light sensitive systems. For example a light sensitive material is considered to be soluble when it can be readily removed by washing with an particular solvent at normal operating temperatures such as room temperature and insoluble when it is not removed upon exposure to a particular solvent under the same or similar temperature conditions.The non silver halide opaque mask 14 can be deposited onto the photochemical layer 12 of the sensitized substrate, using known electrostatic techniques such as xerography, zinc oxide imaging, charge transfer imaging and the like. US Patent 2,862,815, referred to previously and US Patents 3,671,119 and 3,671,120 both issued June 20, 1972 are examples of such electrostatic techniques and are incorporated herein by way of reference.Charge transfer copiers are sold by the Minolta Camera Company. The preferred method for depositing the opagque mask is a laser transfer process which is illustrated ifl Figs. , B through 7 of the drawing and described in greater detail in U atents 3,962,513 issued June 8, 1976 and 3,964,389 issued June 22, 1976 both of which are incorporated herein by way of reference.Other suitable laser transfer techniques are described in S 3,745,586 issued July 10, 1973 and US 3,787,210 issued January 22, 1974, both of which are incorporated herein by referenceBasically what is involved in using a laser transfer tecnnique to form the mask 14 Fig. 4 is to employ a laser transparent film such as a polyester film coated with a formulation containi a material which absorbs laser energy, that is, responsive to a laser energy, such as carbon black particles if the laser is a YAG type , and a binder such as nitrocellulose. To transfer selected portions of the laser responsive coating to the sensitized substrate, a beam of energy from a laser whtch produces radiation in the infrared region such as a YAG Yttrium Aluminum Garnet laser which has an effective output at about 1.06 microns, or an Argon laser which has an effective output in the range of from about 0.48 to about 0.52 microns, is focused by means known in the art through the laser transparer film to the interface between the coating and the film. The energ provided by the laser beam causes a blow off which carries with it the heat absorbing particles and the binder leaving a cear area on the laser transparent film 16 see Fig. 4 Materials suitable as constituents in the laser response ting 18 for forming the mask 14 include thermoplastic polymers such as cellulose acetate, cellulose acetate butyrate, nylon, polycarbonate, polyacylatic, polyvinyl butyrol, phenols, nd the like therosetting polymers such as epoxy, phenolics, melamines and the like vacuum metalized films such as Al, Cr, tali, NiCr, In, Sn, Bi, Ag, Cu, and the like waxes such as beeswax, candelilla, carnauba, Chinese, Japan wax, microcrystalline wax1 paraffin, shellac, and the l4Xe Also dyes only and paints may be utilizend. Opaqueing constituents may be racessary and they include carbon black, graphite and colored pigments organic an inorganic which are selective absorbers for the particular wave length of laser light being used. In addition, oxidizable or explosive constitutents Iray be used to encourage transfer and or increase sensitivity. Materials in this catetory are nitrocellulose, peroxides, azides and nitrates.In a preferred embodiment, the substrate 10 is sensitized with a negative diazo resin such as the zinc chloride salt of the condensation reaction between p diazo diphenylamine formaldehyde, a negative image mask is deposited on the diazo sensitized pate using a laser transfer film the unmasked areas are exposed to UV, and developed with a conventional wipe on lacquer to produce a positive image on the plate whil leaving a positive image on the laser transfer film. Duplicate plates can be made from this laser film by exposing a positive working plate through the film and developing in the conventional fashion.In another embodiment, the substrate is sensitized with an o quinone diazide type of positive working coating, a positive image mask is deposited on the coated plate using a laser transfer film, the unmasked background areas are exposed toUV and developed with a suitable developer to produce a positive image on the plate while leaving a negative image on the laser transfer film. Duplicate plates can be made using this film to expose a negative working plate.In addition to producing lithographic plates, the invention is ideally suited to making name and sign plates and the like. EXAMPLE IA negative working diazo coating 3 diazo so d name Diazo Resin No 4 sold by Fairmont Chemical Co. , wat applied to an aluminum substrate by means of a two roll coateThe aluminum substrate was previosly chemically reined in ammonium bifluoride sulfuric acid anodized end silicated.The coated presensitized plate was then placed in a laser plate maker developed by Lo gEtronics Corporation of Springfield, Virginia. The plate was covered witn a lasar transfer film mede by Scott Graphics of Scott Paper Compan The plate was masked as follows A read laser reads a paste up positive Then an imagingYAG laser was made to pulse in the reverse mode, i. e. it will transfer the masking material in the backqrcund that is, the non image areas only. In this way a positive dmeg was created on the masking film and a negative image c transferred to the underlying plate. The eeked plate was then exposed to UV. This exposure affeoted enly the unmesked areas of the plate.Upon lacquering, the unmasked areas developed to a strong positive image cue to the exposed diazoSimultaneously, the masked areas the negativ image were removed. In this way a positive imaged plate is made using a negative working photo sensitive material.EXAMPLE IIA positive working photo sensitive plate, made by Howsen Algraphy, called at Alympic plate, was placed in a laser plate maker developed by the LogEtronicE Corporation. The laser was used in the conventional mode, i. e. the laser reads positive copy and the write laser YAG transfer a positive image. In the plate meker, the positive plate was covered with the same laser film used in Example I. The YAG laser ablated the mask in a positive fashion leaving a negative image on the film mask and a positive image on the underlying positive working plate. The positive working plate carrying the positive mask was removed from the laser plate maker and blanket exponsed with UV light.The masked areas are not affected by this exposure and the unmasked areas are rendered soluble. Thus, a positive imaged plate is prepared using a positive working photo sensitive coating via a laser masking technique. EXAMPLE IIIA positive working photo sensitive plate, as used in ExampleII is xerographically imaged and toned. The toner particles are then fused, thereby masking the image areas. The on image areas are then exposed to W light effecting a solubility change. The plate is developed in the usual manner and made ready for the press.EXAMPLE IVA positive working, photo sensitive plate, as used in ExampleII, is imaged using a Minolta Electrographic charge transfer copier. The aluminum substrate is anodized on the image side only leaving the back conductive for the charge trans .er process. The toner particles in the deposited image are fused to mask the underlying areas as the plate. The plate is developed in the usual fashion and made ready for the press.
