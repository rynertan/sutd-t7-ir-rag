# CRT deflection distortion correcting circuit.

## Abstract
A deflection distortion correcting circuit for CRT displays with interlaced scanning is disclosed, which corrects concur rently both linearity of vertical deflection and pairing of horizontal interlaced scanning lines which is caused by variation in anode voltage. This is achieved by combining an adder 26 with a cubic curve linearity correction circuit 12, 14, 16 to introduce a pairing correcting component related to the variation in anode voltage into the cubic curve linearity correction.
