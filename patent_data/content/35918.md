# Improvements relating to anti tampering devices for bottles.

## Abstract
A plastics tubular inner body 13 of the device has detachably attached to its lower end a non return valve com prising a ball 14 and a seating ring 15 . A baffle disc 18 formed integrally with the body 13 covers the ball. A flanged plastics collet 16 has at its lower end integral resilient ton gues 31 which are forced into engagement with a shallow channel 11 on the internal surface of the neck by the act of pressing the body 13 and valve down, the valve seating ring 15 having a frustoconical external surface for this purpose. Upward movement of the body relative to the collet 16 is prevented by a shoulder 22 on the body 13 which comes into abutment with the lower ends of the tongues 31 . The valve allows the bottle to be emplied but prevents refilling of the bottle. Attempted interference with the ball valve from above can cause the valve to become detached from the body 13 and fall into the bottle to provide visible evidence of tampering.
