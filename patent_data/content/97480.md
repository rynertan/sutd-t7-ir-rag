## Description
This invention relates to novel triazole derivatives which have antifungal activity and are useful in the treatment of fungal infections in animals, including humans. According to the invention, there are provided 1 12 heterocyclyl 2 5 chloro 2 pyridyl 2 hydroxy ethyl 1,2,4 triazoles of the formula EMI1.1 wherein Bet is an aromatic heterocyclic group and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. The invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier. The invention further provides a compound of the formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for use in treating fungal infections in animals, including humans. The term Bet includes 5 and 6 numbered aromatic heterocyclic ring systems containing up to four heteroatoms selected from N, S or 0, which nay optionally be fused to a benzene or further heterocyclic ring and which may optionally be substituted by up to three substituents chosen from fluoro, chloro, bromo, iodo, C1 C4 alkyl, C1 C4 alkoxy and CF3, in either the heterocyclic or fused ring. Particular examples of heterocyclic groups include pyridyl, pyrimidinyl, thienyl, triazolyl and tetrazolyl groups which may optionally be substituted, especially with halo or C1 C4 alkyl groups. Preferred heterocyclic groups include pyridyl, especially 5 chloro 2 pyridyl, and thienyl, especially 5 chloro 2 thienyl. Thus particularly preferred individual compounds of the invention include l 2,2 Bis 5 chloro 2 pyridyl 2 hydroxgethyljl,2,4 triazole and l t2 5 chloro 2 pyridyl 2 5 chloro 2 thienyl 2 hydrosy ethyl 1 2 ,4 triazole. The compounds of formula I can be prepared by reacting an oxirane of formula II with triazole according to the following reaction schemeEMI2.1 The reaction is generally achieved with the reactants dissolved in a reaction inert organic solvent, e.g. N,N dimethylf ormamide, in the presence of a base, e.g. potassium carbonate. The reaction can be accelerated by heating and we have found that a period of 2 hours at 80 to 90 C is generally sufficient to ensure that the reaction is substantially complete. The product is isolated by evaporation of the solvent followed by extraction with an organic solvent, e.g. ethyl acetate or methylene chloride, to separate the product from the inorganic solids. The crude product may be further purified, if desired, by conventional procedures, for example using chromatography or by recrystallisation from a suitable solvent. The starting materials of formula TI can be obtained by conventional methods from the appropriate heterocyclic compounds.In a typical case they are prepared by reacting a halo substituted derivative III of the desired heterocyclic compound with butyl lithium to generate the anion, which is then reacted with the amide IV prepared for example from 2 bromo 5 chloropyridine and dimethylcarbamoyl chloride, and the product V is converted to the oxirane 11 . The route is shown in the following reaction scheme wherein X is chloro, bromo or iodo.EMI3.1 The halo substituted heterocyclic compounds Ill , preferably the bromo derivatives, are generally known compounds which are either cowmercially available or they are prepared by conventional methods in accordance with literature precedents. In certain instances the required anion can be generated directly from the heterocyclic compound e.g. by reaction with lithiums diisopropylamide. The aide IV is simply prepared from 2 broho 5 chloro pyridine by reaction first with n butyl lithium to generate the anion, followed by reaction vith dimethylcarbamoyl chloride or tetramethylurea. The reaction is typically achieved in diethyl ether at 70 C The ketones V are then prepared by reacting the amide TV with the anion derived from the appropriate halo substituted heterocyclic derivative 111 . In the case of the compound wherein het is 5 chloro 2 pyridyl these two steps can be combined by using a 2 fold excess of 2 bromo S chloropyridine in the reaction with dinethylcarbamoyl chloride, and the ketone V wherein het is 5 chloro 2 pyridyl can be isolated directly. The oxiranes II can be obtained from the ketones V by reaction with dimethyloxosulphonium nethylide prepared from trimethylsulphoxonium iodide and either sodium hydride in dimethylsulphoxide or using cetrimide and sodium hydroxide in a mixture of water and toluene. The reaction nsing scdium hydride is typically achieved by adding dry powdered trimetbylsulphoxonium iodide to a suspension of sodium hydride in dimethylsulphoxide. After stirring for, say, 30 minutes at room temperature, the ketone V is added in an approximately equimolar amount in dimethylsulphoxide. The reaction mixture may be warmed to accelerate the reaction and after several hours at 50 800C, the product can be isolated by conventional procedures. The reaction utilising cetrimide is typically achieved by stirring the ketone V , trimethylsulphozonium fodide and cetrimide vigorously together in a mixture of luene or trichloroethane and sodium hydroxide solution for about an hour at up to about 1000C. The oxirane product can then be isolated by conventional procedures. In an alternative procedure the oxirane can in some cases be more readily obtained by reacting the anion derived from 2 bromo 5 chloropyridine directly with a bromoacetyl beterocyclic compound. It is not generally necessary to isolate the product II but it can be reacted directly with triazole as previously described to give the compound of formula I . Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of the formula I include those formed from strong acids which form non toxic acid addition salts, such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulphuric, nitric, oxalic and methane sulphonic acids. The salts may be obtained by Sonventional procedures, e.g. by mixing solutions containing equimolar amounts of the free base and desired acid, and the required salt is collected by filtration, if insoluble, or by evaporation of the solvent. The compounds of the formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts are anti fungal agents, useful in combating fungal infections in animals, including humans. Por example they are useful in treating topical fungal infections in ian caused by, among other organisms, species of Candida, Trichophyton, Nicrosporn, or Epidermophoton, or in rucosal infections caused byCandida albicans e.g. thrush and vaginal candidiasis .They may also be used in the treatment of systemic fuagal infections caused by, for example, Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Coccidioides, Paracoccidioides, Ristoplasma or Blastomyces. The in vitro evaluation of the anti fungal activity of the compounds can be performed by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration m.i.c. of the test compounds in a suitable medium at which growth of the particular micro organism fails to occur.in practice, a series of agar plates, each having the test compound incorporated at a particular concentration are inoculated with a standard culture of, for example, Candida albicans and each plate is then incubated for 48 hours at 370 C. The plates are then examined for the presence or absence of growth of the fungus and the appropriate ni.i. c. value is noted. Other micro organisms used in such tests can include Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus fumigates, Trichophyton spp Hicrosporum spp Epideriophyton floccosum, Coccidioides immitis, and Torulopsis glabrata. The in vivo evaluation of the compounds can be carried out at a series of dose levels by intraperitoneal or in ravenus injection or by oral administration, to mice which are inoculated with a strain of Candida albicans. Activity is based on the survival of a treated group of mice after the death of an untreated group of mice following 48 hours observation. The dose level at which the compound provides 50Z protection against the lethal effect of the infection is noted. For human use, the anti fungal compounds of the formula I can be administered alone, but will generally be administered in admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier selected with regard to the intended route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. For example, they may be administered orally in the form of tablets containing such excipients as starch or lactose, or in capsules or ovules either alone or in admixture with excipients, or in the form of elixirs or suspensions containing flavouring or colouring agents. They may be injected parenterally, for example, intravenously, intramuscularly or subcutaneously. For parenteral administration, they are best used in the form of a sterile aqueous solution which may contain other substances, for example, enough salts or glucose to make the solution isotonic with blood. For oral and parenteral administration to human patients, it is expected that the dailg dosage level of the anti fungal compounds of the formula I will be from 0.1 to 10 mg kg in divided doses when administered by either the oral or parenteral route. Thus tablets or capsules of the compounds can be expected to contain from 5 mg to 0.5 g of active compound for administration singly or tuo or more at a time as appropriate.The physician i any event will determine the actual dosage which will be most suitable for an individual patient and it will vary with the age, weight and response of the particular patient. The above dosages are exemplary of the average case there can, of course, be individual instances where higher or lower dosage ranges are merited, and such are within the scope of this invention Alternatively, the anti fungal compounds of formula I may be administered in the form of a suppository or pessary, or they may be applied topically in the form of a lotion, solution, cream, ointment or dusting powder.For example, they may be incorporated into a cream consisting of an aqueous emulsion of polyethylene glycols or liquid paraffin or they may be incorporated, at a concentration between 1 and 10 , into an ointment consisting of a white wax or white soft paraffin base together with such stabilizers and preservatives as may be required. The compounds of the formula I and their salts also have activity against a variety of plant pathogenic fungi, including for example various rusts, mildews and moulds, and the compounds are thus useful as agricultural fungicides for treating plants and seeds to eradicate or prevent such diseases.
