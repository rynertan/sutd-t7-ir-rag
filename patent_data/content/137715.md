# Printer.

## Abstract
A printer constructed and arranged so that the body 1 thereof is erect and thus occupies much less floor space than heretofore. Such a printer comprises a paper feed means, a platen 14 and a carrier 17 arranged on a front side 2 of the body, so as to allow ready access set to paper 28 and exchange a printing ribbon. A power source block 18 which forms the most heavy part including a transformer, etc., is arranged at a lower portion on a rear side 3 of the body by utilizing a dead space on the rear side, thus enhancing stability. Further, a handle 11 may be provided at an upper portion of the vertical body, so as to enable the printer to be easily carried.
