## Description
Method of interconnecting optical fibres. The invention relates to a method of connecting a fist bundle of optical fibres, each of the fibres having a protective plastic coating, to a secondbundle of optical fibres which are also provided with a protective coating, in which method the protective coatings of the fibres to be interconnected are removed at the fibre ends over a short distance, the unprotected ends of the respective bundles being placed opposite to each other in a plane surface and the ends of the first and of the second bundle being fused. Such a method is known from a publication of theElectrical Communication Laboratories, viz. E.C.L. TechnicalPublication No. 281, published by Musashino ElectricalCommunication Laboratory, Nippon Telegraph and TelephonePublic Corporation, Tokyo, Japan. Special reference is made to page 6, fig. 7 and page 8, fig. 10. In practice, each pair of fused ends i.e.each separate splice, is provided with an armouring to protect the spliced connection against mechanical loading.A commonly used type of armouring consists of a plastics tube which is provided around the splice and which is made of, for example, ethylene vinylacetate copolymer. Such a copolymer acts as a hot melt adhesive which melts and adheres when it is heated. A metal splint, such as a brass splint, for example of arcuate cross section is provided on the plastics tube. Finally, a plastics shrinksleeve is provided on the plastics tube and the metal splint. The assembly thus obtained is heated, causing the EVA ethylene vinyl acetate plastics tube to melt and the diameter of the shrink sleeve to be reduced. Th,e radial pressure exerted by the shrink sleeve ensures that the entire splice is coated with the molten EVA material, thereby firmly embedding the splice.The armouring process is rather time consuming, costly and it may easily lead to damage to the splice, especially if it has to be carried out under unfavourable field conditions. The armouring process is extremely time consuming if many, for example a hundred, optical fibres have to be interconnected. Moreover, the housing in which the numerous armoured splices have to be accommodated, will become very large and hence difficult to handle. It is the object of the invention to provide a method in which the spliced connections are provided with an armouring in an extremely simple and effective way. According to the invention, this object is accomplished by means of a method as described in the opening paragraph, which is characterized in that the ends thus fused are interposed between two parallel glass plates which are interconnected by means of an adhesive. The glass plates thus interconnected, hereinafter also referred to as armouring , offer excelent protection against, for example, mechanical loading. Moreover, the possibilitv of the glass fibres being stress corroded in a humid environment is counteracted. Glass plates are, as opposed to plastics plates, impermeable to moisture.Another advantage is that the armouring in accordance with the invention can be easily provided, even by less skilled personnel and under difficult conditions such as, for example, in the field outdoors . Furthermore, the armouring is not very voluminous. The glass plates and the fibres have the same coefficient of expansion so that variations in temperature do not give rise to the development of stresses. Preferably, the glass plates are so provided that they extend beyond that part of the bundle where the plastics protecive coating has been removed. Thus, all fibre parts whose plastics protective coating has been removed are fully protected by the armouring, that is they are fully covered by the glass plates which have besn interconnected by means of an adhesive. In a further preferred embodiment of the method in accordance with the invention, the edges of the glass plates between which the bundles are interposed, are rounded. Consequently, the bundles can be bent over the edge without being damaged. Preferably, both the first and the second bundle of optical fibres have the shape of a flat cable or of an ribbon cable, in which the optical fibres are arranged side by side in one plane. The parallel fibres are interposed, for example, between two plastics foils.Such bundles are highly flexible and they can easily be split into subbundles. Reinforcement wires, such as woven glass wires or wires of a strong plastics material, which replace one or more optical fibres, can easily be accommodated in the bundle. The plastics protection material can easily be removed from the ends of such a bundle consequently the ends can easily be spliced. The optical fibre used in the method according to the invention is of a customary type, such as a monomode optical fibre or a multimode optical fibre. The optical fibre comprises a central glass core having a dian eter of 50 um and a glass cladding having a thickness of 37.5 um, the overall diameter of core plus cladding thus amounting to 125 um. A plastics sheath, the so called primary coating, has been provided around the cladding, which sheath may consist of one or more layers. The diameter of the optical fibre, includingthe primary coating, is 250 um. The adhesive used in the armouring in accordance with the invention is preferably a transparent adhesive, the refractive index of which is equal to or substantially equal to that of the cladding of the fibres. Preferably, the cladding and the transparent adhesive have a refractive index nD of approximately 1.5. Thus, it becomes possible to discern, using a microscope, th e glass core andthe glass cladding of the optical fibre. So, it is possible to immediately, visually evaluate the quality of the splice through the armouring, which in practice is an interesting and advantageous feature. Preferably, the glass plates are connected to each other by interposing a foil which is made of a hot melt adhesive, such as an adhesive of ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer. In accordance with another suitable method, the glass plates are connected to each other by means of an interposed, liquid radiation durable lacquer which is cured by means of radiation through the glass plates. The lacquer which can be cured by exposing it to radiation such as U,V. light contains, for example, esters of an acrylic acid or of a methacrylic acid such as a moisture of monoacrylates, diacrylates and or triacrylates and a small quantity, 0,7 8 s by weight, of a light sensitive initiator such as benzil dimethylketal. It is not necessary to integrally connect both bundles of optical fibres, i.e. to interpose all the splices obtained between two glass plates which are connected to each other by means of an adhesive. In a preferred embodiment, dependent upon the application, both bundles each comprise a plurality of sub bundles which are interconnected, each separare pair of interconnected sub bundles being interposed between two parallel glass plates which are connected to each other by means of an adhesive. In yet another preferred embodiment, the invention relates to a method of connecting a first bundle of optical fibres, each fibre having a plastics protective coating, to a second bundle of optical fibres which also have a plastics protective coating, characterized in that the fibres, whose protective coatings have been removed at the ends, are positioned in parallel grooves provided in the surface of a light cured plastics coating which is provided on a transparent supporting plate, in which method the grooved, plastics coated surface isan impression of the surface of a mould, the ends of the bires of the first bundle are placed opposlte those of the second bundle, the ends are interconnected and a second supporting plate is placed over the optical fibres and connected to the first supporting plate by means of an adhesive. The supporting plate, comprising the grooved coating of a light cured plastics material, is manufactured in accordance with the, so called, replica process. In this process, a layer of a light curable, for example, U.V. light, lacquer is applied to the surface of a mould, which surface is the negative of the desired surface of the plastics coating. A transparent supporting plate is placed on the layer of liquid lacquer which is curedby exposing it through the transparent supporting plate. The supporting plate, together with the cured lacquer layer whose surface is the negative of the surface of the mould, is removed from the mould surface. The quality, and in particular the form accuracy, of the grooved surface is excellent due to the extremelyhigh accuracy of the mould. Thanks to the grooves, the optical fibres can be accurately positioned. Suitable lacquers, for example lacquers which can be cured by means of U.V. light have been mentioned in the foregoing,The transparent supporting plate is preferably made of glass. The bonding between the glass and the cured lacquer layer can be improved by means of an adhesive, particularly a silane containing one or more hydrophilic groups such as hydroxyl groups or alkoxy groups and at least one group which co polymerizes with the lacquer. A suitable silane is T methacryl oxypropyl trimethoxy silane. Preferably, the grooves are V shaped so that the position of the optical fibres in the grooves is accurately defined. The length of the grooves is at least equal to the length of the ends of the interconnected optical fibres, the plastics protective layers of which have been removed. Preferably, the depth of the grooves is smaller than the diameter of the optical fibres, so that the fibres etend partly above the surface of the plastics layer. This makes it possible to exactly position the fibres while pressing them into the grooves. The ends of the optical fibres can be interconnected by means of a splice or a glued joint. Preferably, the second supporting plate is made of glass. The invention will now be described in detail with reference to a drawing, in which Fig. 1 is a perspective vie of component parts used in the method according to the invention, Fig. 2 is a crosssectional view of a protected splice in accordance with fig. 1, taken on the line II II, Fig. 3 is a cross sectional view taken on the line III III of Fig. 1, and Fig. 4 is a cross sectional view of a protected splice obtained in a preferred embodiment of the method in accordance with the invention, Reference numeral 1 in fig. 1 denotes a glass plate whose edges 2, 3 are rounded off inwards. On the glass plate 1 there are provided two interconnected bundles 4, 5 of optical fibres 6. The bundles 4, 5 have the shape of a flat cable see fig. 3 .Each bundle contains a number of parallel optical fibres 6 having a glass core 7 and a plastics protectie coating 8. Thediameter of the optical fibre 6 is 250 us. The thickness of the protective coating 8 is approximately 62.5 um. The optical fibres of each bundle are interposed between two plastics foils 9.The plastics protective coating 8 and the foils 9 are removed from the ends 10, II of the fibres 6 which form the bundles 4, 5. The unprotected ends 10, 11 are interconnected by means of a splice 12 which has been obtained by fusing the ends. A foil 13 of a hot melt adhesive is placed on a glass plate 1 having bundles 4, 5 , on top of which a second glass plate 14 is placed. The assembly is heated under pressure, thus causing the hot melt adhesive to melt. After the assembly has cooled the glass plates 1 and 14 are interconnected. It may be advantageous to use a light curable lacquer instead of a hot melt adhesive.In this way, the spliced ends 10, 11 of the optical fibres 6 which form the bundles 4, 5 are extremely well protected against mechanical loading and stress corrosion. Cross sections of the resultant, glass plate protected splices of optical fibres are shown in figures 2 and 3, in which the same component parts as in fig. 1 are denoted by the same reference numeral. The cross section in accordance with fig. 4 corresponds to that of fig. 3, with the exception of the connection in accordance with fig. 4 which contains a glass pla te comprising a plastics coating and grooves. In fig. 4 reference numeral 15 denotes a glass plate which at one main surface has a coating 16 of a light cured plastics material which has been provided with grooves 17. The plate 15. comprising the coating 16 and the grooves 17 is produced in accordance with the replica process as described in detail hereinbefore. In the grooves 17 there are the interconnected ends of the optical fibres 18 whose plastics protective coating has been removed. The depth of the grooves 17 is such that the fibres 18 extend above the surface of the coating 16. A second glass plate 19 is connected to the first glass plate 15by means of an adhesive layer 20.
