# A disc brake having a piston retraction assembly.

## Abstract
A disc brake having a piston retraction assembly in cludes a caliper 12 receiving a piston 14 for biasing a friction pad 16 into engagement with a rotor 18 . A recess 30 on the caliper receives the retraction assembly 32 and a boot assembly 34 cooperates with the retraction assembly 32 to limit movement of the latter with the piston 14 . A resilient member 40 engages the boot assembly 34 to bias the piston 14 via a friction ring 36 to return to its rest position.
