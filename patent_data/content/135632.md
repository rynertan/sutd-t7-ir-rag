# Rotary arc welding apparatus.

## Abstract
A nozzle 1 is rotated at high speed about its axis by a mechanism 5, 6 and has a passage 3, 10 for directing a consumable welding electrode 4 eccentrically from the center axis of the nozzle toward a groove formed between objects to be welded. A feed mechanism continuously di rects the electrode toward the groove through the nozzle. Shielding gas is supplied to the arc welding zone by nozzles 28. A welding current supply arrangement comprises a current receiving plate 9 fixed to the top end of the rotat able nozzle, a stationary brush 11 having on the upper surface thereof a current feed plate 13 , a plurality of rods 19 for holding the brush and the current feeding plate stationary, and a plurality of springs 22 for applying pres sure onto the contact interface between the brush 11 and the rotating current receiving plate 9 . The pressure is such that the nozzle 1 and the current receiving plate 9 can rotate while the brush 11 and the current feed plate 13 remain stationary and at the same time the welding current can flow smoothly from the brush 11 to the receiving plate 9 . This arrangement avoids damage to the nozzle rotating mechanism 5, 6 by archeat or spatters and yet leads to only a small loss of welding current.

## Description
The present invention relates to rotary arc welding apparatus employing a circular movement of an arc from the tip of a consumable welding electrode directed through a nozzle toward a groove formed between the objects to be welded by rotating the nozzle about the center axis thereof at a high speed. A method which permits efficient welding of objects such as thick steel plates with uniform penetration of molten metal without causing welding defects is disclosed in Japanese Patent Provisional PublicationNo. 133,871 80, said method comprising directing a nozzle rotatable about the center axis thereof substantially vertically toward an I shaped narrow groove formed between objects to be welded directing a consumable welding electrode through said nozzle eccentrically from the center axis of said nozzle toward said groove feeding a welding current to said consumable welding electrode to produce an arc between said groove and the tip of said consumable welding electrode to weld said objects to each other by means of heat from said arc rotating said nozzle about the center axis thereof at a high speed, i.e.at least 120 r.p.m., to cause a circular movement of said arc from the tip of said consumable welding electrode corresponding to the eccentricity thereof and feeding a shielding gas toward said arc and a weld zone to shield said arc and said weld zone from the ambient air. In the prior art described above, the welding current is fed to the consumable welding electrode by a welding current feeding mechanism provided on the tip portion of the nozzle or on a consumable welding electrode feeding mechanism located above the nozzle. However, the welding current feeding mechanism, if provided on the lower end portion of the nozzle, would be required to have a complicated construction because of the high speed rotation of the nozzle and may be damaged by the arc heat or spatters produced during welding. Furthermore, when the groove width is very small, the welding current feeding mechanism may make it difficult to insert the nozzle into the groove.When the welding current feeding mechanism is provided on the consumable welding electrode feeding mechanism located above the nozzle, on the other hand, the considerable length of the consumable welding electrode between the tip thereof and the consumable welding electrode feeding mechanism leads to a larger electric resistance of the consumable welding electrode, thus resulting in a larger loss of the welding current. Under such circumstances, there is a demand for the development of a rotary arc welding apparatus which permits sure feeding of a welding current by a simple welding current feeding mechanism to a nozzle rotating about the center axis thereof at a high speed, without causing damage to the welding current feeding mechanism by the arc heat or spatters produced during welding, and which gives only a small loss of the welding current, and which furthermore, has a welding current feeding mechanism not hindering insertion of the nozzle into the groove even when the groove width is small. An object of the present invention is to provide rotary arc welding apparatus which is capable of solving these technical problems. According to the present invention there is provided a rotary arc welding apparatus which comprises a nozzle rotatable about the center axis thereof at a high speed, said nozzle having in the interior thereof a passage for directing a consumable welding electrode eccentrically from the center axis of said nozzle toward a groove formed between objects to be welded a consumable welding electrode feeding mechanism, provided above said nozzle, for continuously directing said consumable welding electrode toward said groove through said nozzle a welding current feeding mechanism for feeding a welding current to said nozzle to produce an arc between said groove and the tip of said consumable welding electrode passing through said nozzle a nozzle rotating mechanism for rotating said nozzle about the center axis thereof at a high speed to cause a circular movement of said arc from the tip of said consumable welding electrode corresponding to the eccentricity thereof, said nozzle rotating mechanism comprising a motor fixed to a carriage, gears for transmitting the rotation of said motor to said nozzle, and a gear box for housing said gears, said gear box rotatably supporting said nozzle passing therethrough and a shielding gas feeding mechanism for feeding a shielding gas toward said arc and a weld zone to shield said arc and said weld zone from the ambient air characterized in that said welding current feeding mechanism 8 comprises a circular current receiving plate 9 , which is fixed to the upper end of said nozzle 1 and rotates together with said nozzle 1 , said current receiving plate 9 having at the center thereof a passage 10 for said consumable welding electrode 4 a circular brush 11 , having substantially the same diameter as that of said current receiving plate 9 , for feeding said welding current to said current receiving plate 9 , said brush 11 having on the upper surface thereof a current feeding plate 13 , the lower surface of said brush 11 and the upper surface of said current receiving plate 9 having a flat contact interface 12 therebetween, and said brush 11 and said current feeding plate 13 having at the center thereof a passage 23 for said consumable welding electrode 4 a plurality of rods 19 for stationarily holding said brush 11 and said current feeding plate 13 so as to prevent same from rotating together with said nozzle 1 and said current receiving plate 9 , the lowerportions of said plurality of rods 19 being inserted into said brush 11 and said current feeding plate 13 , and the upper end portions of said plurality of rods 19 being secured to a supporting plate 21 fixed to said carriage a plurality of springs 22 for applying pressure onto said contact interface 12 between the lower surface of said brush 11 and the upper surface of said current receiving plate 9 , said plurality of springs 22 being provided between said supporting plate 21 and said current feeding plate 13 and said pressure applied by said plurality of springs 22 onto said contact interface 12 between the lower surface of said brush 11 and the upper surface of said current receiving plate 9 being such that, when actuating said nozzle rotating mechanism 5 , said nozzle 1 and said current receiving plate 9 rotate whereas said brush 11 and said current feeding plate 13 do not rotate, and said welding current smoothly flows from said brush 11 to said current receiving plate 9 .

As a result, we found that it is possible to solve the above mentioned problems by adopting a welding current feeding mechanism for feeding a welding current to a nozzle which comprises a current receiving plate fixed to the upper end of the nozzle and rotating together with the nozzle, and a brush having on the upper surface thereof a current feeding plate, and stationarily held so as not to rotate together with the nozzle and the current receiving plate, for feeding the welding current to the current receiving plate. The present invention was made on the basis of the above mentioned finding, and the rotary arc welding apparatus of the present invention is described below with reference to the drawings.As shown in Fig. 1, a nozzle 1 rotatable about the center axis thereof at a high speed has in the interior thereof a passage 3 for directing a consumable welding electrode 4 eccentrically from the center axis of the nozzle 1 toward a groove formed between objects of welding. The lower end portion la of the nozzle 1 has a diameter smaller than that of the other portion thereof, and a tip member 2 is replaceably fitted to the lower end of the nozzle 1. As shown in Figs. 3 a and 3 b , the passage 3, provided through the nozzle 1 and the tip member 2, for directing the consumable welding electrode 4 may be eccentric from the center axis of the nozzle 1 at the tip member 2, or as shown in Fig. 3 c , may be eccentric from the center axis of the nozzle 1 throughout the entire passage 3 of the nozzle 1 and the tip member 2. In Fig. 1, a nozzle rotating mechanism 5 comprises a motor 6 fixed to a carriage not shown , gears not shown for transmitting the rotation of the motor 6 to the nozzle 1, and a gear box 7 for housing the gears.The gear box 7 supports the nozzle 1 passing through the gear box 7 through an insulator not shown rotatably about the center axis of the nozzle 1. A welding current feeding mechanism 8 is provided at the upper end of the nozzle 1, for feeding a welding current to the nozzle 1 to produce an arc between the tip of the consumable welding electrode 4 passing through the nozzle l and groove formed between the objects of welding Now, the welding current feeding mechanism 8 is described with reference to Figs. 1 and 2. A circular current receiving plate 9 is secured for example by driving to the upper end of the nozzle 1. The current receiving plate 9 has at the center thereof a passage 10 for the consumable welding electrode 4. A circular carbonaceous brush 11, which has a diameter substantially equal to that of the current receiving plate 9, for feeding the welding current to the current receiving plate 9, is provided on the upper surface of the current receiving plate 9. The lower surface of the brush 11 and the upper surface of the current receiving plate 9 have a flat contact interface 12 therebetween. A current feeding plate 13 having a diameter substantially equal to that of the brush 11 is secured by means of a plurality of bolts 14 onto the upper surface of the brush 11. The current feeding plate 13 is connected with the end of a cable 15 connected to an electric power source not shown with a terminal 16. InFig. 2, 17 is a terminal fitting bore provided in the current feeding plate 13.A guide pipe 18 described later, which serves as the passage for the consumable welding electrode 4, is provided through the brush 11 and the current feeding plate 13 at their centers. The lower halves of a plurality of rods 19 for stationarily holding the brush 11 and the current feeding plate 13 are inserted into a plurality of holes 20 provided in the brush 11 and the current feeding plate 13 so as not to rotate together with the nozzle 1 and the current receiving plate 9. The upper end portions of the plurality of rods 19 are secured for example by driving to a supporting plate 21 fixed to the carriage. A plurality of coil shaped springs 22 for applying a pressure onto the contact interface 12 between the lower surface of the brush 11 and the upper surface of the current receiving plate 9 are provided between the supporting plate 21 and the current feeding plate 13. The plurality of rods 19 are inserted into the plurality of coil shaped springs 22.The pressure applied by the plurality of springs 22 onto the contact interface 12 between the lower surface of the brush 11 and the upper surface of the current receiving plate 9 is such that, when the nozzle rotating mechanism 5 is actuated, the nozzle 1 and the current receiving plate 9 rotate whereas the brush 11 and the current feeding plate 13 do not rotate, and the welding current smoothly flows from the brush 11 to the current receiving plate 9. The middle portion of the guide pipe 18 having in the interior thereof a passage 23 for directing the con sumable welding electrode 4 toward the nozzle 1 is secured to te supporting plate 21 for example by driving. The lower half of the guide pipe 18 passes through the current feeding plate 13 and the brush 11, and the passage 23 provided in the guide pipe 18 communicates with the passage 10 provided in the current receiving plate 9. As shown in Fig. 1, a consumable welding electrode feeding mechanism 24 for continuously directing the consumable welding electrode 4 toward the groove formed between the objects of welding is provided above the guide pipe 18. The consumable welding electrode feeding mechanism 24 comprises a pair of rollers 25 and 25 and a motor 26 for rotating the pair of rollers 25 and 25 . The consumable welding electrode 4 is continuously directed toward the above mentioned groove through the passage 23 in the guide pipe 18, the passage 10 in the current receiving plate 9 and the nozzle 1, by means of the pair of rollers 25 and 25 driven by the motor 26. A shielding gas feeding mechanism 27 for feeding a shielding gas toward the arc produced between the tip of the consumable welding electrode 4 passing through the nozzle 1 and the above mentioned groove and a weld zone to shield the arc and the weld zone from the open air is provided on the lower surface of the gear box 7.The shielding gas feeding mechanism 27 comprises a pair of opposing gas nozzles 28 and 28 which eject a shielding gas toward the arc and the weld zone and a substantially horizontal gas nozzle support 29 for securing the pair of gas nozzles at a predetermined position. The nozzle support 29 is fitted to the lower surface of the gear box 7 by means of a fitting piece 30. The nozzle 1 passes, through an insulator not shown , through the nozzle support 29 and the fitting piece 30 at the center portions thereof. In Fig. 1, 31 is a detector for detecting the deviation of the tip of the consumable welding electrode 4, which projects from the lower end of the nozzle 1 and rotates, from the center line of the groove. By means of the rotary arc welding apparatus of the present invention having the construction as described above, welding of the objects of welding is conducted as follows. The nozzle 1 is directed toward the groove formed between the objects of welding, and the consumable welding electrode 4 is directed by the consumable welding electrode feeding mechanism 24, through the nozzle 1, eccentrically from the center axis of the nozzle 1 toward the groove. The nozzle 1 is rotated about the center axis thereof at a high speed by the nozzle rotating mechanism 5, and a welding current is fed to the nozzle 1 by the welding current feeding mechanism 8 provided at the upper end portion of the nozzle 1.As a result, an arc is produced between the tip of the consumable welding electrode 4 directed toward the groove eccentrically from the center axis of the nozzle 1 and the groove, and the arc shows a circular movemrnt corresponding to the eccentricity mentioned above caused by the rotation of the nozzle 1. The shielding gas is fed by the shielding gas feeding mechanism 27 toward the arc and the weld zone to shield the arc and the weld zone from the open air.Thus, the objects of welding is efficiently welded with each other without the occurrence of welding defects caused by the heat of the rotating arc as mentioned above. In the rotary arc welding apparatus of the present invention, the welding current feeding mechanism 8 for feeding the welding current to the noz le 1 comprises, as described above, the current receiving plate 9 fixed to the upper end of the nozzle 1, the brush 11 having on the upper surface thereof the current feeding plate 13, the lower surface of the brush 11 and the upper surface of the current receiving plate 9 having the flat contact interface 12 therebetween,the plurality of rods 19 for stationarily holding the brush 11 and the current feeding plate 13, and the plurality of springs 22 for applying a pressure onto the contact interface 12 between the lower surface of the brush 11 and the upper surface of the current receiving plate 9 in such a manner that the nozzle 1 and the current receiving plate 9 rotate whereas the brush 11 and the current feeding plate 13 do not rotate and the welding current smoothly flows from the brush 11 to the current receiving plate 9. It is therefore possible to ensure feeding of the welding current to the nozzle 1 rotating at a high speed by a smiple construction without disturbing the rotation of the nozzle 1. The welding current feeding mechanism 8, being provided at the upper end of the nozzle 1, is not damaged by the arc heat or spatters produced during welding, and does not hinder, even when welding the objects of welding along a narrow groove, the insertion of the nozzle 1 into the groove. In addition, since the welding current flows through a shorter length of the consumable welding electrode than in the case of the welding current feeding mechanism provided on the consumable welding electrode feeding mechanism 24, the electric resistance of the consumable welding electrode 4 is smaller, thus resulting in a relatively small loss of welding current. According to the rotary arc welding apparatus of the present invention, as described above in detail, it is possible, when welding objects of welding while causing a circular movement of an arc from the tip of a consumable welding electrode directed through a. nozzle toward a groove formed between the objects of welding by rotating the nozzle about the center axis thereof at a high speed, to ensure feeding of a welding current to the nozzle by a simple welding current feeding mechanism without damages to the welding current feeding mechanism by the arc heat or spatters produced during welding, to give only a small loss of the welding current, and furthermore, to prevent the welding current feeding mechanism from hindering the insertion of the nozzle into the groove even when the groove width is small, thus providing industrially useful effects
