## Description
PROCESS FOR PRODUCING ALCOHOLS This invention relates to an improved process, and the catalyst which achieves this process, for making ethylene glycol, methanol, and ethanol directly from synthesis gas, i.e., mixtures of hydrogen and carbon monoxide. More particularly, this invention achieves the production of ethylene glycol directly from synthesis gas using a particular synergietic combination of ruthenium carbonyl complexes under process conditionsThis invention encompasses a process of producing ethylene glycol, methanol, and ethanol directly from the reaction of synthesis gas in the presence of a stable ruthenium catalyst. The process of this invention is distinctive in the stability of the process, avoiding any significant loss of ruthenium values from reaction, and in the catalyst employed. DISCUSSION OF THE PRIOR ART Owing to the limited availability of petroleum sources the cost of producing chemicals from petroleum has been steadily increasing. Many have raised the dire prediction of significant oil shortages in the future.Obviously, a different low cost source is needed which can be converted into the valuable chemicals now derived from petroleum sources. Synthesis gas is one such source which can be effectively utilized in certain circumstances to make chemicals. The roost desire aspect of synthesis 1S iS that iZ can De produced ror non petroleum sources. Synthesis gas is derived by the combustion of any carbonaceous material including coal, or any organic material, such as hydrocarbons, carbohydrates and the like. Synthesis gas has for a long time been considered a desirable starting material for the manufacture of a variety of chemicals. A number of chemicals have been made commercially from synthesis gas. Hydrocarbons have been made by the Fischer Tropsch catalytic reaction.Methanol is commercially manufactured by a heterogeneous catalytic reaction from synthesis gas. Aldehydes and alcohols are made from the reaction of olefins and synthesis gas. If one could expand the production of chemicals in a commercial manner from synthesis gas then one would not be as presently dependent upon petroleum as the basic raw material even though it is an excellent raw material for making synthesis gas. Accordingly, intense interest in such processes has developed. Pruett and Walker, U.S. Patent No. 3,833,634, patented September 3, 1974, based on an application originally filed December 21, 1971, describe a process for preparing glycols by reacting an oxide of carbon with hydrogen using a rhodium carbonyl complex catalyst. The examples of the patent compare the reaction of hydrogen and carbon monoxide in the presence of the desired rhodium containing catalyst and other metals.In Example 9 of the patent the reaction was attempted with trir jtheri dodecacarbonyl as the catalyst using tetrahydrofuran as the solvent with a reaction temperature of 230 C., for 2 hours, and the product contained no polyhydric alcohol. As will be shown below, Pruett and Walker apparently failed to produce polyhydric alcohols because they did not run at the conditions of reaction long enough anafor with enough ruthenium containing catalyst to achieve reaction to produce at least a detectable amount of a poyhydrid alcohol such as ethylene glycol. Unquestionably, ruthenium is not a active a catalyst source to produce glycol as is rhodium under the conditions investigated. Gresham, U.S. Patent No. 2,535,060, describes a process for preparing monohydric alcohols by introducing carbon monoxide, hydrogen and a hydroxylated solvent into a reaction vessel and heating the mixture in the presence of a ruthenium containing substance and an alkaline reagent which controls the pH within the range of 7 to 11.5, at a temperature within the range of 1500 to 3000C under a pressure within the range of 200 to 1,000 atmospheres. Solid ruthenium dioxide is used in Examples 1 and 2 of the aforementioned Gresham patent. At column 2, lines 30 33 of the patent, the patentee states his belief that ruthenium dioxide is reduced in situ during the reaction. Example 1 compares the use of a number of solutes such as phosphoric acid, acidic phosphate buffer, no solutes at all, ammonia and sodium bicarbonate. In this example the solvent was water. InExample 2 of Gresham, a number of alcohols were characterized as solvents. Gresham states that ruthenium and its compounds are specific in their effect upon this reaction and other catalysts do not lead to straight chain primary alcohols under the conditions of this process There is no indication that Gresham s process, as operated by him, produced ethylene glycol. Gresham s work should be contrasted with his earlier work described in U.S. Patent No. 2,636,046, filed October 16, 1948. In this patent, Gresham describes the production of polyfunctional oxygen containing organic products including such compounds as ethylene glycol, glycerine, and the like. This is accomplished by the reaction of hydrogen with carbon monoxide in the presence of a solvent to produce glycol. According to this patent, the reaction of carbon monoxide with hydrogen must be at pressures of above 1,000 atmospheres and particularly above a minimun of about 1,400 atmospheres in order to obtain the wpolyfunctional oxygen containing organic compounds... in excellent yield column 2, lines 9 17 .The patent specifically states at column 2, lines 37 43, that n the hydrogenation of oxides of carbon at pressures of 1,000 atmospheres and below, virtually no polyfunctional compounds are produced. At pressures above 1,000 atmospheres and especially at pressures of about 1,500 to 5,000 atmospheres, preferably 2,000 to 5,000 atmospheres, polyfunctional compounds are obtained. Note the evaluation of this work by Rathke and Feeder, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 100, pp. 3623 3625 isIay 24, 1978 . Though the examples of the patent describe only the use of cobalt catalyst, the patentee, at column 3, line 61, indicates that the catalyst may contain cobalt, ruthenium, etc. According to the patentee, the most outstanding results are obtained by using a catalyst containing cobalt, especially compounds of cobalt which are soluble in at least one of the ingredients of the reaction mixtures. According to Roy L. Pruett, Annals, New YorkAcademy of Sciences, Vol. 295, pages 239 248 1977 , at page 245, metals other than rhodium were tested to determine the production of ethylene glycol from mixtures of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. These metals include cobalt, ruthenium, copper, manganese, iridium and platinum. Of these metals, only cobalt was found to have a slight activity, citing British Patent 665,698 which corresponds generally to the last mentionedGresham U.S. Patent. Pruett stated that such slight activity with cobalt was qualitatively in agreement with the results obtained by Ziesecke, 1952,Brennstoff Chem, 33 385. Prior to the filing of U.S. Patent No.2,535,060 and subsequent to the filing of U.S. PatentNo. 2,636,046, there was filed on April 12, 1949, a commonly assigned application by Howk, et al. which issued as U.S. Patent No. 2,549,470 on April 17, 1951.The Howk, et al. patent is directed to a catalytic process for making monohydric straight chain alcohols and does not mention the production of ethylene glycol. The patent emphasizes the production of straight chain primary hydroxyalkanes having from 3 to 50 or more carbon atoms in the molecule. This, the patent states, is accomplished by introducing hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and a hydroxylated solvent into a reaction vessel, and heating the mixture in the presence. of a catalyst of the class consisting of ruthenium metal ruthenium oxide and ruthenium carbonyl, at a pressure within the range of 200 to 1,000 atmospheres and at a temperature within the range of 1000to 2500C. The liquid hydroxyl containing reaction medium may be water or alcohol, preferably a primary hydroxyalkane having from 1 10 carbon atoms per molecule.According to the patentee, a substantial proportion of the reaction product usually consists of alcohols containing more than 6 carbon atoms per molecule. The patent goes on to state column 1, line 50, et set The reaction products usually contain virtually no hydrocarbons, acids, esters, or branched chain alcohols.These results were entirely unexpected, in view of the existing knowledge of the catalytic reaction between carbon monoxide and hydroqen in the presence of alcohols and Group VIII metal catalysts. n According to the Howk, et al. patent nIt should be emphasized here that, under the conditions of temperature, pressure and gas ratios just described, no reaction takes place between carbon monoxide and hydrogen in a liquid medium water or alcohol if one of the common group VIII metals, such as cobalt or nickel, is used as the catalyst. This is. evidenced by the fact that, using, for example, a cobalt catalyst, no significant droop in pressure is observed when carbon monoxide and hydrogen are contacted under the conditions recited. Ruthenium is thus unexpectedly different from these related metals. 1 Column 4, lines 19 30. The numbered examples indicate an apparent preference for making normal monohydric alcohols, with the proportion of pentane soluble to pentane insoluble alcohol being at least 2 1. In one example, starting at the bottom of column 6 of Howk, et al., the solvent employed is characterized as a carboxylic acid or anhydride rather than the neutral hydroxylated solvents which were described in the other examples.This comparative example demonstrated that in a process operated at 2000C. for 18 hours using pressures maintained in the range of 300 950 atmospheres by repressurizing periodically with synthesis gas, there was produced a reaction product containing a large quantity of wax. According to the author, 40.55 parts of esters boiling from 590C. at atmospheric pressure to 1500C. at 116 millimeters pressure were obtained and this can be compared to the wax obtained in the amount of 37.06 parts. In that particular example, the patentee appears to have demonstrated that when the hydroxylated solvent is not employed, the amount of wax essentially equals the amount of pentane soluble alcohol products obtained.This is supported by the statement t column 2 of Gresham U.S. 2,535,060 which refers to Howk, et al. At column 3, lines 54 et seq., Howk, et al.describe the influence that pressure has on the course of the reaction. According to Howkt et al. with pressures up to about 150 atmospheres the reaction products are only hydrocarbons. This appears to be in accord with recent work described by Masters, et al. inGerman Patent Application Offenlegungsschrift 2,644,185 , based upon British priority applicationSpecification No. 40,322 75, filed October 2, 1975.Masters, et al. obtained only hydrocarbons at such pressures using a ruthenium catalyst. Fenton, U.S. Patent No. 3,579,566, patented May 18, 1971, is concerned with a process of reducing organic acid anhydrides with hydrogen in the presence of a Group VTIT noble metal catalyst and a biphyllic ligand of phosphorus, arsenic or antimony. The process ofFenton bears a remarkable similarity to oxo processing conditions to produce aldehydes and alcohols compare with Oliver, et al., U.S. Patent No. 3,539,634, patentedNovember 10, 1970 except that Fenton fails to supply an olefinic compound to the reaction. In the reaction ofFenton, an acid anhydride, such as acetic acid anhydride, is reduced to ethylidene diacetate in the presence of hydrogen and a rhodium halide or a mixture of palladium chloride and ruthenium trichloride catalyst, provided in combination with triphenylphosphine. Ethylene glycol diacetate is also observed. Carbon monoxide, which is added to some of the examples of Fenton, is described by Fenton, at column 2, lines See Doyle, et al., J. of Organometallic e., 174, C55 C58 199 , who conclude that Lie process characerized in the German Offenlegungsschrift involved a heterogeneous Fischer Tropsch reaction. 48 51, as follows tif desired, a suitable inert gas, such as carbon monoxide can also be charged to the reaction zone... . Emphasis added . Of particular significance is the fact that none of Fenton s examples produce a methyl ester, as are produced by the process of copending U.S. Patent Application S.N. 971,667, discussed below. Another point is that . erton s ethylidene diacetate can be thermally cracked to produce vinyl acetate, see column 1, lines 42 44. It would seem possible that such occurred in Example 1 of Fenton and it is further possible that acetic acid added to the vinyl acetate to form ethylene glycol diacetate. In copending application Serial Number 971,667, filed December 21, 1978, there is described a process for producing methyl and ethylene glycol esters by reacting carbon monoxide and hydrogen in a homogeneous liquid phase mixture comprising a rutheniur carbonyl complex and acyl compound such as acetic acid. The reaction is effected at a temperature between about 50 C. to about 400 C. and a pressure of between about 500 psia 35.15 kg cmê and about 12,500 psia 878.84 kg cmê for a period of time sufficient to produce such esters as the predominant product. In copending application Serial Number 971,750, filed December 21, 1978, there is described an improved process for producing methyl and ethylene glycol esters 35 described in Serial Number 971,667, in which the improvement comprises maintaining the combined concentration of methyl ester, ethylene g glycol ester and water in the reaction medium at less than about 30 vol. . Tn copending application Serial Number 091,242, filed November 15, 1979, there is described an improved process for making the products methanol, ethylene glycol, and ethanol or mixtures thereof, at relatively low pressures. An interesting exception to the previously reported inactivity of ruthenium catalysts to produce glycol is the high pressure viz 1650 1750 bars experiment reported by Fonseca, Jenner, Kiennemann, andDeluzarche, et al., High Pressure Science andTechnology, 6th AIRAPT.Conference Chapt. High pressureSynthesis of Polyalcohols by Catalytic Hydrogenation ofCarbon Monoxide , pages 733 738 1979 , published byPlenum Press, New York see also a discussion of the same work in Erdol und Sole, 32, 313 1979 . The authors report the reaction in tetraglyme of a CO H2 1 2 ratio mixture at 1650 1765 bars, i.e., about 25,000 psi 1,757.6 Kg cm2 and 230QC using triruthenium dodecacarbonyl and 2 pyridinol as a ligand, both in unstated amounts, for a period of 5 hours.The authors report a percent conversion of 12.9 unstated basis , and percent yield of polyols of 3 unstated basis , and percent selectivities as follows ethylene glycol, 22.9 glycerine, 0 methanol, 16.1. However, in a manuscript entitled Reactions CO H2 in Liquid Phase in Presence of Ruthenium Catalysts, by Jenner, Kiennemann, Bacherzadah, and Deluzarche, React. Kim.Catal. Letters, 15, 103 1980 . it is stated that wiz respect to the above experiment We never could reproduce the run with Ru3 CO 12 when operating in a vessel which has not been in contact with any rhodium catalyst. We suspect that in the former run, the formation of ethylene glycol was due to catalysis with metallic sediments of rhodium encrusted on the wall of the vessel we showed that ethylene glycol is produced in appreciable yield with rhodium foam . InWilliamson, et al., United States Patent 4,170,605 patented October 9, 1979 the patentees report inExamples I and II the reaction in l propanol of synthesis gas CO H2 1 1 at 25,000 psig and at 2300C using ruthenium tris acetylacetonate and 2 hydroxypyridine, the latter being the same ligand employed by Fonseca, et al, supra, for a period of 2 and 3 hours, respectively. In Example 1, Williamson, et al., report the production of 4 grams of product containing mole percent basis ethylene glycol, 57 and methanol 25. In Example II, 7 grams of product are reported containing 66 and 16 mole percent of ethylene glycol and methanol, respectively. W. Keim, et al., Journal of Catalysis, 61, 359 This report may be relevant to the reports by Williamson et al, infra and Keim et al, infra . Included in the 4 and 7 grams of product are trace amounts of water and methylfornate as well as 16 mole percent Example I and 15 mole percent Example II of propylformate. .e latter compound would appear to be derived from l propanol initiall rent in the reaction mixture, rather than a synthesis gas derived product. 1980 has reported that reactions of Ru3 CO 12 under very high pressures 2,000 bars produce mainly methanol and methyl formate, but traces of glycol 0.8 to 1.2 percent of the total products were also seen.In one experiment a small amount of ethanol was detected. No glycerine was observed in these reactions. In a recent report J. Am. Chem. Soc., 101, 7419 1979 . , J.S. Bradley of Exxon Corporation reported the production of methanol and methyl formate at a selectivity greater than 99 without hydrocarbon products detected, by the reaction of synthesis gas H2 CO 3 2 under pressures on the order of 1,300 atmospheres and at temperatures around 2700C using a Ru catalyst. Bradley observed that no ethanol, ethylene glycol, or acetates formed. Compare this result with that found by Pruett and Walker, supra, and the work ofFonseca, et al. and Williamson, et al., sura, As pointed out above, ethylene glycol can be produced directly from a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide using a rhodium carbonyl complex as a catalyst. The literature describes see U.S. Patent No. 3,957,857, issued May 18, 1976 that a desirable rhodium compound can be in the form of a rhodium carbonyl cluster compound, particularly one which exhibits aparticular 3 band infrared spectral pattern. There has been a substantial amount of work done on the formation of ethylene glycol from ixtures of hydrogen and carbon monoxide in the presence of rhodium carbonyl clusters, such as is described in United States Patent Nows. 3,833,634 3,878,214 3,878,290 3,878,292 etc. to name but a few. The above discussion provides a characterization of the technology heretofore published or filed upon which relates to the direct production of ethylene glycol from mixtures of carbon monoxide and hydrogen or the production of monohydric alcohols from the direct reaction of hydrogen and carbon monoxide in the presence of a ruthenium catalyst. For the purposes of the discussion and descriptions contained herein, mixtures of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, regardless of the amount of each present, will be characterized, for the sake of convenience, as synthesis gas . Thus, mole ratios of hydrogen to carbon monoxide of e.g. 40 to 1 and 0.05 to 1 are arbitrarily classified as synthesis gas . Where the molar ratio of one or the other is significant to the invention herein described, then specific reference to the desired molar ratio will be made.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The process of this invention relates to the production of ethylene glycol in a homogeneous liquid phase reaction by employing a synergistic mixture of a ruthenium carbonyl iodide containing complex and a ruthenium carbonyl hydrido complex.The ruthenium catalyst employed in the process is indicated by the presence of two ruthenium carbonyl complexes, i.e., Ru CO 3I3 and HRu3 CO t1, which constitute a synergistic combination indicating the ruthenium comprise the automotive,combustion devices for reducing automotive pollutant emissions. Thus, a commercial process which uses rhodium as a catalyst is affected by the high capital expense to purchase the metal and the stringent controls needed to limit catalyst loss in order to keep the economics of the process competitive. Ruthenium, on the other hand, is a precious metal which presently has no significant commercial application.Its present cost is approximately 1 20th, and less, that of rhodium even though its concentration in the ore from which both are obtained is about the same. Ruthenium has been explored as a catalyst by many, as is shown by the discussed references, sura. It has been considered aS a hydrogenation catalyst, as a hydroformylation catalyst, as a catalyst to produce a wide range of monchydric alcohols non specific as to any of. them exclusive of methanol, as an alcohol homologation catalyst such as for the conversion of methanol to ethanol, as a high, pressure catalyst to selectively produce methanol and methyl formate, and its inactivity as a catalyst to produce glycol has been noted above. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF TE INVENTION This process constitutes a relatively low See Cornils, et al., Hydrocarbon Processing, ne, 1975, pp. 93 t 91. See, for example, U.S. Patents 4,133,966 and 3,285,943 and Japanese Patent Application Kokai No. 52 73804 77 June 21, 1977 Application No. 50 149391 75 application date, December 15, 1975 to Mitsubishi was Chemical Industry Conpany. catalyst which is charactertzed by an infrared spectrum characterized by three significant infrared bands between about plus or minus 10cm Ú of about 2100cm 1, 2015cm 1, and 1990cm 1. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The process of this invention involves the conversion of synthesis gas, however derived, into a limited variety of valuable alcohol compounds which themselves can be directly consumed or which can be employed as starting materials to make other valuable chemicals. The process of this invention is concerned with making 2 carbon atom alcohols, to wit, ethanol and ethylene glycol and in particular, ethylene glycol. In addition, the process of this invention also produces methanol. The process of this invention is capable of producing predominantly ethylene glycol or predominatly methanol, or predominantly ethanol, or mixtures o them each in large concentrations.The process of this invention provides the capability of a low cost route to methanol, ethanol and ethylene glycol, especially ethylene glycol. One of the deficiencies of certain of the aforementioned processes for making ethylene glycol from synthesis jas was tI e utilization of A rhodium carbonyl complex as the catalyst , which processes are dependent on the high price of rhodium. The high cost of rhodium is create b its 1I nited availability and the tremendous demand for it. For example rhodium presently is employed in catalytic converters which pressure process for selectively converting synthesis gas to such valuable chemicals as ethylene glycol, ethanol and methanol. Also produced by the process of this invention are glycerol i.e. glycerine , 1,2 propylene glycol, l propanol and methyl formate.However, the process of this invention is mainly concerned with the production of ethylene glycol the most valued product and to a lesser extent ethanol and methanol, since they are produced in significantly greater amounts than the other products. The process of this invention is accomplished by the presence of a synergistic combination of two ruthenium carbonyl complexes. The process of this invention is carried out with a synergistic mixture of ruthenium carbonyl complexes present in a solvent, even though such complexes may exist during the reaction in more than one liquid phase. In this sense, the reaction is termed a homogeneous liquid phase reaction. There may be more than one such phase existing in the reaction zone but the ruthenium catalyst, as indicated by the presence of the two ruthenium carbonyl complexes, is always dissolved in at least one of such phases and is always in a dissolved liquid state. The problem with employing heterogeneous ruthenium catalysis in the reaction zone s that such will induce Phe Fischer Tropsch reaction resulting in . le formation of hydrocarbons and or a variety of oxygenated hydrocaroons having a variety of molecular weights with low selectivity to any one compound. In fact, the presence of such products suggests that undissolved ruthenium is present and that a non homogeneous liquid phase reaction occurred. The process of this invention involves the solubilization of ruthenium and the presence oE the synergistic combination of ruthenium carbonyl complexes in the presence of synthesis gas at temperatures, pressures and for a period of time sufficient to produce ethylene glycol. Such conditions are set forth herein.In simplistic and in the broadest terms, the invention comprises the solubilization under the reaction conditions i.e., time, temperature and pressure of a ruthenium source, perferably ruthenium in the absence of any other platinum group metals viz., platinum, palladium, rhodium and iridium , in an appropriate solvent under a prescribed synthesis gas pressure toprovide a ruthenium carbonyl catalyst characterized by the synergistic mixture of ruthenium carbonyl complexesRu CO 3I3 and BRu CO 11 which mixture is characterized by an infrared spectrum having three significant infrared bands between about plus or minus 10cm 1 of about 2100cm 1, 2015cm 1 and 1990cmll Further, other infrared bands are usually observed at 2070cm 1, 195scum 1 and 1720cm 1 seeFigures 1 4 . It will be appreciated that the exact position of said infrared bands may be dependent on the solvent employed, counter ions present, the presence of ligands and the like, but in most cases will be wi thir See U. S. Patent 3,989,799, patented November 2, 1976, wherein ruthenium is a cation in a mixed metal rhodium containing carbonyl complex. slOcm 1 of the above stated value. The reaction conditions comprise i a period of time at a temperature and pressure which cause the hydrogen and carbon monoxide to react to produce the desired products ii a temperature between about 50 C. and 4000C. and 34.5 bar 2 iii a pressure between 500 psia 35.15 kg cm and 1035 bar abs.15,000 psia 1,054.6 kg cm . The catalyst of this invention is indicated by the presence of three significant infrared bands, and the aforementioned ruthenium containing carbonyl complexes which under the prescribed reaction conditions catalyze the aforementioned reaction between carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The process of this invention is distinctive in the selection of materials which comprise the homogeneous liquid phase mixture, the reaction parameters and the stability of the ruthenium containing catalyst in most cases, indeed, in all cases studied.As with any technology, this process has undergone evolutionary changes and its further examination will undoubtedly bring more changes, most likely in the form of additional or substitutional steps and or materials. It is known that this process may be carried out in the presence of a promoter although selection of the promoter is not clearly understood. A promoter, i the context of this invention, is a material provided to the reaction which provides a promotional effect in that it enhances the production viz., rate, yield, or efficiency of any of the products, or it troves the selectivity of the reaction toward ethylene glycol rather than methanol or ethanol, or it improves the selectivity of the reaction to ethanol rather than methanol irrespective of the amount of ethylene glycol produced, or it helps to reduce the loss of ruthenium during the reaction.Typical of the promoters that are believed capable of being employed in the instant process are Lewis base promoters Csuch as those described in copending U.S. Serial No 091, 242, filedNovember 15, 1979, and incorporated by reference herein to the extent that such promoter enhances the instant process. The solvent is selected such that the solvent is cabable of maintaining the ruthenium carbonyl complex catalyst in the homogeneous liquid phase mixture throughout the reaction. The solvent may possibly provide an additional benefit such as influencing the kinds of ion pairing that exist during the course of the reaction. The catalyst of this invention is a ruthenium carbonyl catalyst which contains carbon monoxide directly bonded to ruthenium ruthenium carbonyl . The ruthenium compound which is provided to the reaction is not necessarily in a form which will effectively catalyze the reaction even if it contains a carbon monoxide ligand bonded to it. Ruthenium compounds such as ruthenium salts, oxides and carboxyl cI ters may be introduced to the reaction in a condition which allows them to be solubilized, and under the conditions of the such average oxidation state is most preferred.Similarly, as above discussed, ruthenium containing compounds which provide the ruthenium carbonyl catalyst of this invention may be employed. The ruthenium containing substances which may be employed. in the practice of this invention tosform the catalyst, as characterized by the synergistic ruthenium carbonyl mixture, under process conditions encompass those which are described, for example, inGresham, U.S. Patent No. 2,535,060 at column 2, starting at line 38 to line 48, and ruthenium carbonyl compounds. It generally is not advisable to place ruthenium compounds or substances on a support material for use in the process of this invention because such offers no benefits over solubilizing such ruthenium compounds in combination with the aforementioned solvent and or promoter. Moreover, ruthenium deposited on a support material can be expected to be solubilized in the homogeneous liquid phase reaction system of this invention as it is contacted with carbon monoxide. Ruthenium oxides, such as dioxide, sesquioxide, or tetraoxide, may be converted to the ruthenium carbonyl complex employed in the process of this invention.Ruthenium carbonyl compounds which include ruthenium carbonyl hydrides or ruthenium carbonyl clusters are already provided with a carbonyl ligand, and uner ne conditions of the reaction can be s lciently changed to achieve the desired catalytic effect. Ruthenium salts such as those of organic acids can be employed in reaction they are converted into carbonyl complexes which effectively catalyze the reaction. The composition and structure of the ruthenium carbonyl complexes which catalyze the desired reaction are not specifically known but their presence is indicated by a mixture of two ruthenium carbonyl complexes, i.e. Ru CO 3I3 and HRu3 CO 11 , having characteristic infrared spectrum characterized by three significant infrared bands between about plus or minus 10cm 1 of about 2100cm 1, 2015cm, and 1900cm 1.Varied reaction conditions, solvents, ligands, counter ions, promoters if employed , may result in different amounts of the desired products of the process and different rates, efficiencies and or yields, but it is believed that although each provides a different and distinct catalytic evironment that the synergistic mixture of ruthenium carbonyls aforementioned and the characteristic infrared spectrum will be present. The aforementioned ruthenium carbonyl catalyst of this invention is also characterized by having an average oxidation state of between about 0.2 and about 0.25. The average oxidation state of the synergistic combination of the ruthenium carbonyl complexes is calculated by taking the oxidation state of a ruthenium atom in HRu3 CO 11 as 1 3 and the oxidation state of a ruthenium atom in Ru CO 3I3 as 2.Accordingly, the average oxidation state of a 2 1 ratio of HRu3 CO 11 to Ru CO 3Ir3 is zero and the practice of this invention to produce the catalyst.In addition to those ruthenium compounds described in the aforementioned Gresham patent, one may employ ruthenium compounds of bidentate ligands, allyl complexes, arene complexes, halides, and alkyl complexes. The choice of ruthenium compounds is varied and not critical to this invention so long as the aforementioned characteristic infrared spectrum is observed. A number of ruthenium complexes are known to be more stable to the presence of carbon monoxide than other ruthenium compounds and the skilled worker can determine which particular ruthenium compound might take longer to initiate a reaction than other ruthenium compounds. On that basis, one can select for the purposes of convenience the particular ruthenium compound to be utilized in forming the catalyst.However, ruthenium which is associated with an organic molecule or complexed with carbon monoxide is most readily solubilized so as to provide a readily available source of the ruthenium carbonyl catalyst of this process. Although the exact nature of the actual ruthenium catalyst is not precisely known the presence of an active catalytic system is indicated by the presence either before, during or after the process is carried out of a synergistic mixture of Ru CO 3I3 and RR CO llo This mixture can be initially provided to the process or formed in situ, such as bv the reaction of Ru3 CO 12 with excess I as follows EMI24.1 Selection of the ruthenium containing starting material is important if in situ formation is desired since it has been observed that use of Ru II or Ru III halide complexes which do not form the synergistic mixture of Ru CO 3I3 and HRu3 CO 11 do not provide the ruthenium catalyst employed in the process of this invention. However, such Ru II or Ru III complexes may be converted to the ruthenium catalyst according to this invention by reaction with appropriate base and an iodide containing compound.For example, if the ruthenium compound is RuI3 the following depicts the conversion of such compound EMI24.2 Ru CO 3I3 2HRu3 CO 11 18I 21H2OThe complex Ru CO 3I3 may be converted to an active Ru catalyst as follows EMI24.3 Ru CO 3I3 2HRu3 CO 11 18I 14H2OSimilarly, the Ru catalyst according to the invention may be prepared by employing HRu3 CO ll as follows EMI24.4 Ru CO 3I3 2HRu3 CO 11 2 3 CO 1 6 H2 higher, of greater than 2 are preferred. Illustrative of suitable polar solvents are, e.g., water, ketones, esters including lactones, amides including lactams, sulfones, sulfoxides, halogenated hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, and the like.Illustrative of specific solvents encompassed bycthe above classes of polar solvents dre, for example, aromatic hydrocarbons, e.g., benzene, toluene, xylene, naphthalene, alkylnaphthalene, etc. carboxylic acids suchas acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, caproic acid, stearic acid, benzoic acid, cyclohexanecarboxylic acid, etc. see the description of acyl compounds in S.N. 971,667 ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, cyclohexanone cyclopentanone, etc. esters such as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, propyl acetate, butyl acetate, methyl propionate, ethyl butyrate, methyl laurate, etc. anhydrides such as phthalic anhydride, acetic anhydride, etc. lactams such as N alkyl caprolactams, such as N methylcaprolactam N alkyl pyrrolidinones such as N methyl pyrrolidinone cyclic ureas such as N,N dimethylimidazolidone polyols such as ethylene glycol, glycerine, erythritol, polyalkylene glycol containing two to about ten thousand repeating units lactones such as gamma butyrolactone halogenated hydrocarbons such as chlorobenzene, chloroform, methylene chloride, 2, 2 dichloropropane amides such as dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, hexamethyl phophoramide sulfones suc as sulfoiane, dimethylsulfone the substituted sulfolanes,described in In addition, the presence of the ruthenium complex catayst of this invention is indicated by a reaction medium having an infrared spectrum characterized by three significant infrared bands between about plus or minus 10cm 1 of about 2100cm 1, 2015cm 1 and l99Ocm 1. As characterized by equations 1 , 2 and 3 the formation of the catalyst according to this invention is inhibited by the addition of base reducing agent and acid oxidizing agent beyond that required to give the ruthenium catalyst. As characterized above, this process is operated as a homogeneous liquid phase mixture. The process is typically carried out in a solvent for the catalyst. The solvent is a liquid in which the catalyst components are soluble under the prescribed conditions of the reaction. The solvent may be solid at room temperature but should at least, in part, be a liquid under the conditions of reaction A preferred solvent is a liquid at reaction conditions which is polar or complexes ions. Of the polar solvents those which have a relatively high dielectric constant are more referred. As for the solvents which complex ions, the desirable solvents are those which under the reaction conditions have the capacity of complexing ions such as available cations. As stated previously, th solvent may provide a promote component Solvents having a dielectric constant at 25 C. or at its melting temperature, whichever is U.S. Applications Serial No. 61,456, filed July 27, 1979 sulfoxides such as dimethylsulfoxide, diphenyl sulfoxide as well as many others. Illustrative of suitable complexing solvents are the ethers, cryptands, and the like. Illustrative of specific solvents encompassed by the above classes of complexing solvents are, for example, ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, tetrahydropyran, diethyl ether, 1,2 dimethoxybenzene, l,2 diethoxybenzene, the mono and dialkyl ethers of alkylene and polyalkylene glycols, such as ethylene glycol, of 1,2 propylene glycol , of 1,2 butylene glycol, of diethylene glycol, of di 1,2 propylene glycol, of triethylene glycol, of pentaethylene glycol such as triglyme, tetraglyme and pentaglyme , of di l,2 butylene glycol, of oxyethylene oxypropylene glycols, etc., preferably those in which the alkylene group contains 2 and or 3 carbon atoms in the divalent moiety, such as ethylene and i,2 propylene the cryptands such as described in tJ.S. Patent No. 4,111,975, which description of crystands, as promoters in that case, is incorporated herein by reference the crown ethers or Crown Ethers, as one may prefer such as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,162,261, which description of crown ethers, as solvents in that case, is incorporated herein by reference as well as many others. The choice of sclvent in any particular case can be a complex decision. For example, the carboxylic acids, if employed, are also reactive with ethylene glycol, methanol and ethanol products, to produce ethylene glycol dicarboxylates, methyl carboxylates, and ethyl carboxylates. These carboxylates can be readily hydrolyzed to produce the alcohol products. This is not necessarily an uneconomical method to produce such products. An important class of solvents contemplated in the practice of this invention is a mixture of the aforementioned polar solvents and the complexing solvents. Various polar solvents mixed wit other polar or complexing solvents are contemplated to provide enhanced results either in terms of rates, selectivity, conversions and or yields of one or more of the desired products. Which mixtures will achieve what result has not been determined. Combinations of, e.g., sulfolane with crown ethers, lactones, amides or ureas are contemplated as potentially useful. Combinations of, e.g., crown ethers with lactones, amides, and ureas are contemplated .as potentially useful. The iodide containing compounds employed herein may comprise most any iodide containing compound, including such compounds as iodide salts of metals such alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, cobalt diiodide, iron II iodide and the like Organic iodide containing compounds may also be employed, e.g. Bis tri phenylphosphine iminium iodide tetramethylammonium iodide, triethylammonium iodide oyriainium iodide tetra n propylammonium iodide tetra n butylammonium iodide tetraphenylphcsonium iodide tetraphenyl arsonium iodide tet,ra n butylphosphonium iodide phenyltrimethylammonium iodide and the like.The addition of such iodide salts is beneficial to provide the formation of ethylene glycol at a substantial rate.Generally, an increase in the concentration of iodide promoter increases the overall rate to ethylene glycol although the selectivity to glycol may decrease. It is belived that the process may be carried out in the presence of a promoter although selection of the promoter is not clearly understood. A promoter, in the context of this invention, is a material provided to the reaction which provides a promotional effect in that it enhances the production viz., rate, yield, or efficiency of any of the products, or it improves the selectivity of the reaction toward the products. The promoter can be any material used in miniscul.quantities to a material employed in maximum quantities the effectiveness of which will in large measure be dependent upon the reaction conditions selected. Representative of the promoters employed in the instant process are iodide containing compounds. It is believed that other promoters may also be employed. Though the process of this invention is capable of providing a combination of ethylene glycol, ethanol and methanol, in many instances one or more of them is formed as a minor component only. Because ethylene glycol is the most valued of the products, its production obviously makes this process attractive. By the same reasoning, ethanol s higher market value than methanol also enhances the commercial attractiveness of this process. A process which produces the same amount of ethylene glycol and produces more ethanol will have more commercial attractiveness, assuming all other factors are equal. The relative amounts of carbon monoxide and hydrogen which are initially present in the reaction mixture can be varied over a wide range. In general, the molar ratio of CO H2 is in the trance of from about 40 1 to about 1 40, suitably from about 20 1 to about 1 20, and preferably from about 10 1 to about 1 10. it is to be understood, however, that molar ratios outside the broadest of these ranges may be employed. Substances or reaction mixtures which give rise to the formation of carbon monoxide and hydrogen under the reaction conditions may be employed instead o the mixtures comprising carbon monoxide and hydrogen which are used in preferred embodiments in the practice of he invention. For instance, the product alcohols are contemplated as obtainable by using mixtures containing carbon dioxide and hydrogen. Mixtures of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and hydrogen can also be employed. If desired, the reaction mixture can comprise steam and carbon monoxide. The quantity of catalyst employed is not narrowly critical and can ary over wide r1ne. general, the process is desirably conducted in the prrsence of a catalyticallv er,Tective quantity of the active ruthenium species which gives a suitable and reasonable reaction rate. The presence of the catalytic species is indicated by the presence of two ruthenium carbonyl complexes, i.e. Ru CO 3I3 and HRu3 CC 11. It has been observed that th rate of ethylene glycol formation is related to the ratio of these complexes such that although their combined presence indicates the presence of the active ruthenium catalyst, the rate to ethylene glycol increases if the mole ratio of Ru CO 313 to HRu3 CO ll is between about .01 and about 2, preferably between about 0.2 and about 1. The reaction can proceed when 6 employing as little as about 1 x 10 weight percent, and even lesser amounts, of ruthenium based on the total weight of reaction mixture i.e., the liquid phase mixture . The upper concentration limit can be quite high, e.g., about 30 weight percent ruthenium, and higher, and the realistic upper limit in practicing the invention appears to be dictated and controlled more by economics in view of the cost of ruthenium.Since the rate of conversion of synthesis gas may be dependent upon the concentration of ruthenium employed, higher concentrations achieving higher rates, then large concentrations may prove to be a most desirable embodiment of this invention. Depending on various factors such as the promoter if employed , the partial pressures of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, the total operative pressure of the system, the operative temperature, the choice of solvent, and other considerations, a catalyst concentration of from about 1 x 10 to about 20 weight percent ruthenium contained in the complex catalyst based on the total weight of reaction mixture, is generally desirable in the practice of the invention The temperature which may be employed in practicing the process may vary over a wide range of elevated temperatures. In general, the process can ve conducted at a temperature between 500C. and about 400 C. and higher. Temperatures outside this stated range, though not excluded from the scope of the invention do not fall within certain desirable embodiments of the invention. At the lower end of the temperature range, and lower, the rate of reaction to desired product becomes markedly slow. At the upper temperature range, and beyond, catalyst, solvent, or promoter instability may occur.Notwithstanding these factors, reaction will continue and the alcohols and or their derivatives will be produced. Additionally, one should take notice of the equilibrium reaction for forming ethylene glycol 2 CO 3E2 BOCH2CH2OHAt relatively high temperatures the equilibrium increasingly favors the left hand side of the equation.To drive the reaction to the formation of increased quantities of ethylene glycols higher partial oress s of carbon monoxide and hydrogen are required. Proces based on correspondingly higher operative however, do not represent preferred embodiments of the invention in view of the high investment costs associated with erecting chemical plants which utilize high pressure utilities and the necessity of fabricating equipment capable of withstanding such enormous pressures. Preferred temperatures are between about 1000C. and about 3500C., and most desirably between about 150 0C. and about 3000C. The process is suitably effected over a wide superatmospheric pressure range. At pressures in the 34.5 bar abs. 2 direction of and below about 500 psia 35.15 kg cm the rate of desired product formation is quite slow, and consequently, relatively faster reaction rates and or higher conversions to the desired products can be obtained by employing higher pressures, e.g., pressures 69 bar abs 2 of at least about 1,000 psia 70.31 kg cm 1380 3450 barPressures as high as 20,000 to 50,000 psia 1,406 to 3,515.5 kg cmê , and higher, can be employed but there is no apparent advantage in using such pressures, and any advantage that could be reasonably contemplated would be easily offset by the very unattractive plant investment outlay required for such high pressure equipment and the costs associated with such high pressure operations.Therefore, the upper pressure limitation is approxi 1035 bar 2 mately 15,000 psia 1,054.6 kq cm . Effecting the 1035 bar process below about 15,000 1,054.6 kg cmê , 690 bar abs.especially below about 10,000 psia 703.1 kg cmê results in sianificant cost advantages which are associated with lower pressure equipment requirements and operating costs. A suitable pressure range is from 34.5 bar 2 828 bar abs.about 500 psia 35.15 kg cmê to about 12,000 psia 878.84 kg cmê . The pressure referred to above represent the total pressure of hydrogen and carbo monoxide The process is effected for a period of tine sufficient to produce the desired alcohol product and or derivatives thereof. In general, th residence time to produce the desired products can vay from minutes to a number of hours, e.g., from a few minutes to 24 hours, and longer.It is readily appreciated that the residence period time will be influenced to a significant extent by the reaction temperature, the concentration and choice of promoter and ruthenium sour, the total gas pressure and the partial pressure exerted by its components, the concentration and choice of solvent, and other factors. The synthesis of the desired product s by the reaction of hydrogen with carbon monoxide is suitably conducted under operative condition which give reasonable reaction rates nd or conversions. The process can be executed in a bath, semi continuous, or continuous fashion The reaction can be conducted in a single reaction zone or a plurality of reaction zones, in series or in parallel, or it may be conducted intermittently or continously in an elongated tubular zone or series of such zones The material of construction should be such that it is inert during the reaction and the fabrication of the equipment should be able to withstand the reaction temperature and pressure. The reaction zone can be fitted with internal and or external heat exchanger s to thus control undue temperature fluctuations, or to prevent possible run away reaction temperatures due to the exothermic nature of the reaction.In preferred embodiments of the invention, agitation means to vary the degree of mixing of the reaction mixture can be suitably employed.Mixing induced by vibration, shaker, stirrer, rotatory,.oscillation, ultrasonic, etc., are all illustrative of the types of agitation means which are contemplated.Such means are available and well known to the art. The catalyst precursor may be initially introduced into the reaction zone batchwise, or it may be continuously or intermittently introduced into such zone during the course of the synthesis reaction. Means to introduce and or adjust the reactants, either intermittently or continuously, into the reaction zone during the course of the reaction can be conveniently utilized in the process especially to maintain the desired molar ratios of and the partial pressures exerted by the reactants. As intimated previously, the operative conditions can be adjusted to optimize the conversion of the desired product and or the economics of the process. In a continuous process, for instance, when it is preferred to operate at relatively low conversions, it is generally desirable to recirculate unreacted synthesis gas with without make up carbon monoxide and hydrogen to the reactor. Recovery of the desired product can be achieved by methods well nown in the art such as by distillation, Eractionation, extraction, and the like. A fraction comprising ruthenium complexes, generally contained in byproducts and or the solvent, can be recycled to the reaction zoner if desired.All or a portion of such fraction can be removed for recovery of the ruthenium values or regeneration thereof, if necessary. Fresh ruthenium precursor, promoter and or solvent, can be intermittently added to the recycle stream or directly to the reaction zone, if needed. Many embodiments of the ruthenium carbonyl complexes, promoter and solvent combinations encompassed by this invention are sufficiently stable to allow repeated use of the ruthenium carbonyl complexes. This is especially noted when the promoter is an alkali metal halide, particularly and preferably an alkali metal iodide. For example, the process of this invenion can be continuously operated in a pressure reactor into which is continuously fed synthesis gas. The velocity of the synthesis gas is sufficient to strip products of the reaction out of the reactor heating behind the reactor the ruthenium carbonyl complex, promoter and solvent combination.The products are separated from the unreacted synthesis gas and the synthesis gas is recycled to the reactor. The products, in this embodiment, are recovered free of ruthenium, promot if employed, and solvent. In this embodiment, the catalyst need not be removed from the recovery zone for separating produce Thus St treatment step is avoided. The examples below depict batch reactions however, the above continuous gas recycle process can be operated in a similar manner.That is, the batch reactor simulates the continuous reactor except for the gas sparging and continuous gas recycle. Although this invention has been described with respect to a number of details, it is not intended that this invention should be limited thereby. Moreover, the examples which follow are intended solely to illustrate a variety of, including the most favorable, embodiments of this invention and are not intended in any way to limit the scope and the intent of this invention. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE The following procedure was employed in the examples recorded below. A 150 ml. capacity stainless steel reactor capable of withstanding pressures up to 3,000 bar atmospheres was charged with a mixture of solvent, catalyst precursor, and optionally a promoter, as indicated below. The reactor was sealed and charged 34.5 bar with carbon monoxide to a pressure of 500 pounds per 2 square inch gauge psig , 36.19 Kg cm . In some cases the gaseous contents of the reactor are vented to remove oxygen.In these cases the reactor is then 34.5 bar repressurized to about 500 psig. This venting procedure may be repeated if desired. Heat was then applied to the reactor and its contents, intially at about 550C. or as otherwise indicated when the temperature of the mixture inside the reactor reached the designated reaction temperat ure, as measured by a suitably placed thermocouple, addition, of carbon monoxide and hydrogen H2 CO equals the designated mole ratio was made to bring t pressure t the specified reaction pressure. The temperature was maintained at the desired value for te reported time period.During this period cf tine, additional carbon monoxide and hydrogen were added whenever te pressure 34.5 bar inside the reactor dropped by more than about 50 psig. 36.19 Kg cm over the entire reaction period. After the reaction period, the reaction vessel was cooled to room temperature, the reaction vessel vented and the reaction products removed. Analysis of the reaction mixture was made by gas chromatographic methods. The various rates set forth in the following examples are average rates for the particular product and are determined by measuring the net production of product for the reaction period and assuming a nominal reaction volume of 75 ml. in the following examples, the following procedure was employed The infrared spectra of the reaction mixtures were analyzed by withdrawing a sample from a sample bottle blanketed with a nitrogen atmosphere. The sample is placed in an infrared cell having CaF2 windows separated by a 0.1 nm spaced. if necessary, t sample was diluted with the solvent employed in carrying out the reaction.The infrared spectra were recorded using a Perkin Elmer 281B infrared spectrophotometer with an infrared cell containing reactor solvent being placed in the reference beam.
