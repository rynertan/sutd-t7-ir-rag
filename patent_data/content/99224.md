# Optical coupling device.

## Abstract
An optical coupling device for diverting light among different transmission elements is disclosed. A plurality of transmission elements 11, 12, 13 are coupled to one surface 32 of a focusing element 10 which is in the form of a 1 4 pitch graded refractive index GRIN rod. Positioned near the opposite surface 33 are first and second at least partially reflecting elements 15 and 16 . The first element 15 may be affixed to the end surface of the focusing element and covers only a portion thereof. The second element is positioned further from the end surface and at an angle to the first element. The area of the first element is chosen to produce a desired splitting ratio, and the angle between elements can be adjusted to maximize coupling efficiency between the transmission elements. The device can be used, for example, as a three port coupler, an asymmetric four port coupler, or a four port power divider.
