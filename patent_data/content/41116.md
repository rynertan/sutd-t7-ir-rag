# COMPOSITE LABEL WEB ROLL

## Abstract
There is disclosed a composite web roll of pressure sensi tive labels especially suited for use with a label dispensing apparatus. The composite web includes a carrier web for a series of pressure sensitive labels. The carrier web includes longitudinally spaced groups of cuts arranged to provide entry of a toothed driver with only minimal force and yet the carrier web is not readily susceptible to tearing as the carrier web is pulled about a delaminator.
