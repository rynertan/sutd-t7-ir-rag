# A fluid injector and pressure amplifier.

## Abstract
A hydraulically operated fuel injector for compression ignition engines which includes an electronically or pneumatically operated hydraulic pilot control valve 30 which is supplied with fuel under substantially constant pressure from a pump driven directly or indirectly by the engine. The pilot control valve 30 is connected by supply and exhaust passages to a slave valve which in turn controls the admission of fuel to a charging cavity 86 located adjacent to an outlet valve 98 to the combustion chamber. The slave valve is a stepped diameter piston 72 and 82 which functions as a pressure amplifier for the fuel supply to the combustion chamber. Fuel from the pump which is received at relatively low pressure through the slave valve is amplified to high pressures sufficient to overcome compression and combustion pressures of the engine and the resistance of spring seated injector outlets and or the fuel supply orifice s .
