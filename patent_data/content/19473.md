# Method for manufacture of polymer impregnated hollow concrete product.

## Abstract
A polymer impregnated concrete product is obtained by placing a concrete mix 2 in a frame 1 capable of withstanding high temperature and high pressure in such a manner as to form therein a hollow portion, molding the concrete mix to obtain a concrete article containing a hollow portion 3 therein, causing the concrete article as held in a tightly closed state in the frame to be cured by application of heat, subjecting the concrete article, as retained in the frame 1 , to treatments for drying and deaeration, then supplying a monomer preparation to the hollow portion of the concrete article, applying pressure to bear upon the concrete article thereby causing the monomer preparation to be diffused into the fine voids in the concrete article, and heating the concrete article in situ thereby allowing the diffused monomer to be polymerized.
