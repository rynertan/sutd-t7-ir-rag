# COMMODITY HANDLING SYSTEM

## Abstract
A system for conveying different commodities such as different types of coal between a number of points, such as mines 10, 12, 14 and silos 34, 36, 38, 40, has a number of different paths linking the points defined by conveyor units. Stacker conveyors 16, 18, 20, 22 are used to deposit coal in different stockpiles and reclaimer conveyors 24, 26, 28, 30, 32 are used to reclaim the coal from the stockpiles. A computer not shown is employed which is supplied with information as to which conveyor units are available for conveying and determines an optimum route for a commodity between two points in accordance with the supplied information. The computer also ensures that different commodities are kept separate from one another.
