## Description
The present invention relates to a silver halide photographic light sensitive material. Photographic silver halide emulsions have lately been more severely demanded than ever before to be improved on the photographic characteristics thereof i.e., to be so improved as to have a higher sensitivity, more excellent graininess, higher sharpness, lower fog density, and a more adequately wide exposure scale. For such demands, a silver iodobromide emulsion containing from zero to 10 mole silver iodide are well known as a high sensitivity emulsion. And for the preparation of such high sensitivity emulsions there have been conventionally known pH and pAg control methods such as the ammoniacal method, and the neutral method, and mixing methods such as the single jet method, and the double jet method. In order to accomplish the still higher sensitivity, more improved graininess, higher sharpness and lower fog density on the basis of these known techniques, technical means therefor have been pursued to the utmost extent and made practical reality. In silver iodobromide emulsions which are the subject of the present invention, researches have been conducted on emulsions wherein not only the crystal habit and granularity distribution thereof but also the silver iodide concentration distribution inside the individual silver halide grains thereof are controlled. The most orthodox way to accomplish such photographic characteristics as the above mentioned high sensitivity, excellent graininess, high sharpness, low fog density, and the like, is to improve the quantum efficiency of the silver halide. Knowledge of solid state physics is positively introduced in for this purpose. A study in which the quantum efficiency is theoretically calculated to make considerations on the influence of the granularity distribution is described in, e.g., Interactions Between Light and Materials p.91, of the prepared texts for the Tokyo Symposium 1980 for the Progress in Photography. This study predicts that the preparation of a monodisperse emulsion with its granularity distribution being narrowed will be effective in improving the quanturm efficiency. And in addition, the inference that the monodisperse emulsion is also advantageous for attaining efficiently a high sensitivity with its fog remaining low in a process called chemical sensitization that will be detailed hereinafter is considered reasonable. The production of a monodisperse emulsion on an industrial scale, as is described in Japanese Patent Publication Open to Public Inspection hereinafter referred to as Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No.48521 1979, requires the theoretically found control of the supplying rate of the silver and halogen ions to the reaction system under precise pAg and pH controls and under an adequate stirring condition of the reaction system. The silver halide grain of the emulsion produced under such conditions is in the cubic, octahedral or tetradecahederal form that is, the emulsion comprises regular crystal grains each having 100 and 111 faces in various proportions, and such regular crystal grains are known to be highly sensitizable. On the other hand, silver iodobromide emulsions comprising polydisperse twin grains are conventionally known as the emulsion suitable for a high speed photographic film. In addition, plate twin grains containing silver iodobromide emulsions are disclosed in Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No.113927 1983 and others. On the other hand, raising the development activity, increasing the sensitivity, by the application of multistratified type silver halide grains formed by coating a plurality of shells around the internal core are described in Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No.22408 1978, and Japanese Patent Examined Publication No.13162 1968, J. Photo. Sci., 24, 198 1976 . The silver halide grain provided with coat stratums by the halogen substitution as the outermost stratum thereof is described in West German Patent No.2932650, Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication Nos.2417 1976, 17436 1976, and 11927 1977. However, such silver halide grains are not practically applicable as the grains for a negative emulsion in respect that they, although capable of accelerating the fixing rate, restrain the development to the contrary, thus being unable to provide any adequate sensitivity. And positive type internal latent image type silver halide grains each having outside the core thereof a plurality of coat stratums by the halogen substitution are known and detailed in U.S. Patent Nos.2,592,250 and 4,075,020, and Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No.127549 1980. Such silver halide grains are those frequently used in the internal latent image type direct positive light sensitive material for use in the diffusion transfer process and are by no means applicable to any one of ordinary negative type emulsions because the internal sensitivity thereof is excessively high. Meanwhile, Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication Nos.181037 1983, 35726 1985, and 116647 1984, also disclose those silver halide grains each having shell stratums around the internal core thereof, the shell stratums each containing a diverse amount of iodide. In the silver halide photographic light sensitive material s field, color light sensitive materials whose sensitivity exceeds an ISO speed index of 1000 have in recent years made their appearance thanks to the remarkable progress in various techniques. However, it is the status quo that such light sensitive materials, since they become, without exception, deteriorated in the sharpness as well as in the graininess as their sensitivity goes up, produce images inferior in quality to those from conventional light sensitive materials, thus being unsatisfactory for the appreciation by consumers. Upon this, great hope has now been placed on the realization of high speed light sensitive materials excellent in the sharpness as well as in the graininess. In the astrophotography, indoor photography or sports photography, still higher speed negative type light sensitive materials are indispensable. A color image is usually obtained as a result of the formation of a dye image by the coupling reaction of couplers with the oxidized product of a color developing agent. In a multicolor photographic element, the subtractive method is usually used for the color image formation, and the dyes to be formed by the coupling may be normally the cyan, magenta and yellow dyes which are formed in the respective silver halide emulsion layers or other layers adjacent thereto, the emulsion layers being sensitive to the wavelength regions the rays of which are absorbed by the image dyes i.e., sensitive to the red, green and blue regions of the spectrum. Those couplers forming these dyes are desirable to be such that the color dye produced therefrom be very sharp in its hue be excellent in the color reproducibility cause no such discoloration as reduction discoloration and be excellent in the produced dye cloud s graininess. Those phenols and naphthols conventionally used as the cyan coupler to be contained in a silver halide emulsion having the sensitivity thereof in the red region of the spectrum are couplers excellent in the color reproducibility because the absorption maximum λmax of the color formed dye therefrom is generally in a longer wavelength region and the sub absorption thereof in the green region is small. These couplers, however, have the disadvantage that the dye formed therefrom is generally discolored in a weak oxidation bleach fix process to form a leuco dye, thus causing a failure in the color formation. In order to solve such the disadvantage, the use of a cyan coupler not causing any reduction discoloration in the bleach or bleach fix process is required, and as the cyan coupler of this type, e.g., British Patent No.1,011,940, U.S. Patent Nos. 3,446,622, 3,996,253, 3,758,308, and 3,880,661, disclose those phenol type cyan couplers having an ureido group in the second position thereof. However, these couplers are unfavorable in respect of the color reproducibility because the absorption spectrum of each of the dyes formed therefrom has a sub absorption in a shorter wavelength region. On the other hand, those ureido phenol type cyan couplers having a specific ureido group in the second position of the phenol and an acylamino group in the fourth position of the phenol, which are described in Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No.65134 1981, are known as the coupler improved so that the cyan dye formed therefrom is not discolored and the cyan dye s absorption maximum in the spectrum is in a relatively longer wavelength region. However, it has now been found as a result of our investigation that the use of such ureido type cyan couplers causes outstanding deterioration of the sensitivity as well as of the graininess of film where the film has been allowed to stand over a long period of time, particularly, under high temperature high humidity conditions. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a silver halide photographic light sensitive material which causes no complex color trouble of the cyan dye image, which is excellent in the graininess, and which is improved on the stability in aging particularly excellent in the preservability under high temperature and high humidity conditions. That is, the present invention can be achieved with a silver halide photographic light sensitive material which comprises light sensitive silver halide emulsion layers at least one layer of which comprises at least one of phenol type cyan couplers having in the second position thereof a group selected from the class consisting of phenyl ureido, naphtyl ureido and heterocyclic ureido groups and in the fifth position thereof an acylamino group at least one layer of the light sensitive silver halide emulsion layers comprising negative type silver halide grains comprised of an internal core consisting substantially of silver bromide and or silver iodobromide and a plurality of shell stratums being provided around the internal core and consisting substantially of silver bromide and or silver iodobromide, a plurality of shell stratums comprising the outermost shell stratum, intermediate shell stratum and internal shell stratum, the outermost shell stratum containing equal to or less than 10 mole iodide, the internal shell stratum being a high silver iodide containing shell hereinafter called high iodide shell containing iodide 6 mole more than that of the outermost shell stratum, the intermediate shell stratum containing a medium amount of iodide and being provided between the outermost shell stratum and the high iodide shell stratum and containing iodide 3 mole more than that of the outermost shell stratum, the high iodide shell stratum containing iodide 3 mole more than that of the intermediate shell stratum. In the silver halide composition of the core shell type silver halide grains of the present invention, the phrase ...consisting substantially of... used herein means that any silver halide other than the silver bromide or silver iodobromide, for example, silver chloride, is allowed to be contained to such an extent as not to impair the effect of this invention to be concrete, in the case of silver chloride, the allowable silver chloride content is desirable to be not more than 1 mole . The features of the photographic light sensitive material of this invention will be given in the following 1 8 In order to further improve the above mentioned effects, if the iodide content mole of the high iodide shell is regarded as Ih the iodide content mole of the intermediate shell as Im and the iodide content mole of the outermost shell as Iℓ, the respective contents and the relations therebetween should be preferably ΔI Ih Iℓ 8 mole , ΔIh Ih Im 4 mole , and ΔIℓ Im Iℓ 4 mole , and more preferably ΔI 10 mole , ΔIh 4 mole , and ΔIℓ 4 mole the foregoing 4 , wherein Iℓ should be equal to 0 5 mole , preferably equal to 0 2 mole , and more preferably equal to 0 1 mole and Ih should be equal to 6 40 mole , and more preferably equal to 10 40 mole the foregoing 3 . The volume of the outermost shell should be from 4 to 70 of the whole grain, and more preferably from 10 to 50 . The volume of the high iodide shell should be from 10 to 80 of the whole grain, preferably from 20 50 , and more preferably from 20 to 45 . The volume of the intermediate shell should be from 5 to 60 of the whole grain, and more preferably from 20 to 55 . The high iodide shell may be at least part of the internal core, but the inner side of the high iodide shell should be preferably provided with another internal core. The iodide content of the internal core should be from zero up to 40 mole , preferably from zero up to 10 mole , and more preferably up to 6 mole . The diameter of the internal core should be from 0.05 to 0.8µm, and more preferably from 0.05 to 0.4µm. Also, in the foregoing feature 5 the iodide content of the whole grain should be from 1 to 20 mole , preferably from 1 to 15 mole , and more preferably from 2 to 12 mole . In the foregoing feature 6 , regarding the granular diameter distribution, the emulsion may be either polydisperse or monodisperse, but it should be a monodisperse emulsion whose granular diameter distribution s coefficient of variation is preferably equal to or less than 20 , and more preferably equal to or less than 15 , wherein the coefficient of variation is defined as and this is a measure for expressing the monodispersibility. The granular diameter of the silver halide grain defined as the length of a side of the cube whose volume corresponds to that of the silver halide grain should be from 0.1 to 3.0µm, and the form thereof may be any of the octahedral, cubic, spherical, or plate form, and should preferably be octahederal. Referring further to the stratified structure of the silver halide grain relating to the present invention, the internal core and the high iodide shell may be the same as has been mentioned above or otherwise a different internal core may be provided inside the high iodide shell. The internal core and high iodide shell, the high iodide shell and intermediate shell, and the intermediate shell and outermost shell may be adjacent to each other, or otherwise may have therebetween at least one different shell stratum of an arbitrary composition called an arbitrary shell . Such the arbitrary shell may be a single shell of an uniform composition or comprised of a plurality of uniform composition shells or a group of shells whose composition varies by stages or a continuous shell, an arbitrary shell, whose composition varies continuously or a combination of these shells. And the high iodide shell and the intermediate shell each may be a plurality of shells or a single shell. Subsequently, examples of the stratified construction of the silver halide grain of the present invention will be described below, wherein the iodide content is shown with I . The internal core of the silver halide grain relating to the present invention may be prepared by any of those methods as described in Chimie et Physique Photographique by P. Glafkides published by Paul Montel in 1967 , Photographic Emulsion Chemistry by G. F. Duffin The Focal Press, 1966 , and Making and Coating Photographic Emulsion by V. L. Zelikman et al The Focal Press, 1964 . Namely, it may be prepared using any method including the acidic method, neutral method, and ammoniacal method, with any mixing method for the reaction of the water soluble silver salt with the water soluble halide including a single jet method, a double jet method, and a combination of these methods. A method in which the grain is formed in the presence of an excess of silver ions the so called reverse mixing method may also be used. In addition, a method, as one of double jet methods, which is carried out with the pAg in the liquid phase for forming a silver halide being maintained constant i.e., the controlled double jet method, may be used as well. This method enables to obtain a silver halide emulsion having regular crystalline and uniform size silver halide grains. Separately formed two or more silver halide emulsions may be mixed, but the use of the double jet method or controlled double jet method is preferred. The pAg in preparing the internal core varies according to the reaction temperature and the kind of the silver halide solvent used, but is preferably from 2 to 11. The use of the silver halide solvent is preferred because it enables to shorten the grain forming time. Examples of the silver halide solvent usable include well known silver halide solvents such as ammonia, thioether, and the like. The configuration of the internal core used may be any of plate, spherical, twin, octahedral, cubic or tetradecahedral form, or complex of these forms. In order to make the grain size uniform, it is desirable to grow fast the grain to the extent not to exceed the critical saturation degree by using those methods for varying the adding rate of silver nitrate and halogenated alkaline solutions according to the growth rate of the grain as described in British Patent No.1,535,016, Japanese Patent Examined Publication Nos.36890 1973 and 16364 1977, or those methods for varying the aqueous solution s concentration as described in U.S. Patent No.4,242,445 and Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No.158124 1980. These methods may be advantageously used also in introducing the arbitrary shell, high iodide shell, intermediate shell and outermost shell because the coat on each silver halide grain can be made without the ocurrence of another core. A single or a plurality of arbitrary shells may at need be provided between the high iodide shell and the internal core of the silver halide grain relating to the present invention. This high iodide shell may be provided by an ordinary halogen substitution method or silver halide coating method after subjecting the desalting process, if necessary, to the formed internal core or to the arbitrary shell provided internal core. The halogen substitution method may be carried out after the formation of the internal core, for example, by the addition of an aqueous iodide compound preferably potassium iodide solution, preferably equal to or less than 10 solution more particularly, it may be carried out by any of those methods as described in U.S. Patent Nos.2.592,250 and 4,075,020, and Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No.127549. In this instance, in order to lessen the difference in the iodide distribution in the high iodide shell between the grains, it is desirable to make the aqueous iodide solution s concentration equal to or less than 10 ² mole and to add the solution spending more than ten minutes. Newly coating a silver halide over the internal core may be carried out by, e.g., adding aqueous halide and silver nitrate solutions simultaneously, i.e., the double jet method, or the controlled double jet method, and more particularly by any of those methods as described in Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No.22408 1978, Japanese Patent Examined Publication No.13162 1968, Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No.14829 1983, and J. Photo. Sci. 24,198 1976 . The pAg in forming the high iodide shell, although it varies according to the reaction temperature, the kind and quantity of the silver halide solvent used, may be as described previously, and where ammonia is used, is desirable to be from 7 to 11. The formation of the high iodide shell may be made more preferably by the double jet method or the controlled double jet method. The intermediate shell of the silver halide grain relating to this invention may be provided through coating by the double jet method or by the controlled double jet method on the external of the grain containing the high iodide shell having a high iodide shell surface or having thereon, if necessary, a single or a plurality of arbitrary shells and the internal core a further silver halide of a halide composition different from the halide composition of the high iodide shell. For this purpose the previously mentioned method for the high iodide shell may be similarly used. The outermost shell of the silver halide grain relating to this invention may be provided through coating by the double jet method or by the controlled double jet method on the external of the grain containing the intermediate shell having the intermediate shell surface or having a single or a plurality of arbitrary shells, the high iodide shell and the internal core a further silver halide of a halide composition different from the halide composition of the high iodide shell. For this purpose the previously mentioned method for providing the high iodide shell may be similarly used. The arbitrary shell can be one stratum each or a plurality of strata each provided between the internal core and the high iodide shell, between the high iodide shell and the intermediate shell, and between the intermediate shell and the outermost shell, or otherwise the arbitrary shell is allowed not to be provided. For such arbitrary shells the previously mentioned method for the high iodide shell is similarly usable. In the internal core, high iodide shell, intermediate shell, outermost shell, and arbitrary shells to be provided in the respective positions, in the course of providing any such adjacent shells, if necessary, a desalting process may take place in usual manner, or otherwise the formation of the shells may be continued without the desalting process. The iodide content of each shell of the silver halide grain relating to the present invention may be found according to the method described in, e.g., J. I. Goldstein, D. B. Williams X Ray Analysis in TEM ATEM in Scanning Electron Microscopy 1977 Vol. No.1 IIT Research Institute, p.651 March 1977 Annual Meeting of SPSTJ 84 , p 49 51 1984 The International East West Symposium on the Factors Influencing Photographic Sensitivity 1984 , c 60 c 63 1984 Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No. 143331 1985 and Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No. 143332. In an emulsion containing silver halide grains as the final product after the formation of the outermost shell, the excess of the halide compound produced at the time of the preparation or the secondarily produced or disused salts such as the nitrate, ammonia, or compounds may be removed from the dispersion medium of the silver halide grain. The removal may be arbitrarily made in accordance with the noodle washing method or dialysis method, commonly used for ordinary emulsions, or the flocculation method, utilizing inorganic salts, anionic surfactants, and anionic polymers such as polystyrenesulfonic acid or gelatin derivatives such as acylated gelatin, carbamylated gelatin . The core shell type silver halide grains relating to the present invention may be optically sensitized to desired wavelength regions. The invention places no particular restrictions on the method of optical sensitization for example, the optical sensitization may be made by using alone or in combination cyanine dyes such as zeromethine dyes, monomethine dyes dimethine dyes, trimethine dyes, or optical sensitizers such as merocyanine dyes. Combinations of such sensitizers are frequently used particularly for the purpose of supersensitization. Along with such sensitizers the emulsion may also contain a dye which itself has no spectral sensitization effect or a substance substantially not absorbing visible rays but exhibits supersensitization effect. These techniques are described in U.S. Patent Nos.2,688,545, 2,912,329, 3,397,060, 3,615,635 and 3,628,964, British Patent Nos.1,195,302, 1,242,588 and 1,293,862, West German OLS Patent Nos. 2,030,326 and 2,121,780, Japanese Patent Examined Publication Nos.4936 1968 and 14030 1969, and also described in Research Disclosure Vol. 176, 17643 Dec. 1978 . The selection of thee materials may be arbitrarily male according to the purpose and the use of the light sensitive material, such as the wavelength region to which the light sensitive material should be sensitized, and the sensitivity. The core shell type silver halide crystal relating to the present invention may be chemically sensitized by being subjected to various chemical sensitization treatments which are usually applied to general emulsions. For the chemical sensitization those methods may be used which are described in Die Grundlagen der Photographischen Prozesse mit Silberhalogeniden edited by H. Frieser Akademische Verlagsgesellschaft, 1968 675 734. That is, the sulfur sensitization method, which uses compounds containing sulfur capable of reacting with silver ions or active gelatin, the reduction sensitization method, which uses reductive materials, and the noble metal sensitization method, which uses gold or other noble metallic compounds, may be used alone or in combination. Examples of the sulfur sensitizer include thiosulfates, thioureas, thiazoles, rhodanines, and other compounds, of which contrete examples are described in U.S. Patent Nos.1,574,944, 2,410,689, 2,278,947, 2,728,668, 3,656,955, 4,032,928 and 4,067,740. Examples of the reduction sensitizer include stannous salts, amines, hydrazine derivatives, formamidinesulfinic acid, and silane compounds, of which concrete examples are described in U.S. Patent Nos.2,487,850, 2,419,974, 2,518,698, 2,983,609, 2,983,610, 2,694,637, 3,930,867 and 4,054,458. For the noble metallic sensitization, in addition to gold complex salts, those complex salts of metals belonging to Group VIII of the periodic table such as platinum, iridium, and palladium, may be used, of which concrete examples are described in U.S. Patent Nos.2,399,083 and 2,448,060, and British Patent No.618,061. The chemical sensitization of the silver salt of this invention may be carried out by using in combination two or more of these chemical sensitization methods. The coating amount of silver may be arbitrarily settled, and is preferably from 1000mg m² to 15000mg m², and more preferably from 2000mg m² to 10000mg m². The light sensitive layer containing the silver halide grain may be allowed to be present on both sides of a support. Various types of dopant may be used for doping each shell of the core shell type emulsion of the present invention at the time of the formation thereof, of which those usable as the internal dopant include, e.g., silver, sulfur, iridium, gold, platinum, osmium, rhodium, tellurium, selenium, cadmium, zinc, lead, thalium, iron, antimony, bismuth, and arsenic. For the doping of any of these dopants water soluble salts or complex salts of such dopants may be made present together with the respective shells.

Typical examples of the synthesis of the ureido type cyan coupler of the present invention will be described below The ureido type cyan coupler of the present invention may be synthesized in principle through the following synthesis route Eighteen point nine grams of 2 amino 4 chloro 5 nitrophenol were dispersed into 200ml of toluene, and to the mixture, with stirring at room temperature, were added 100ml of a toluene solution containing 21g of 3 ethoxycarbonylphenyl isocyanate. The obtained reaction mixture was refluxed by boiling for an hour, and then cooled to room temperature. The resulting crystals were filtered, washed with methanol, and then dried, whereby 34g of a light yellow solid, m.p.261 266 C, were obtained. Nineteen grams of 2 3 ethoxycarbonylphenyl ureido 4 chloro 5 nitrophenol were added to 600ml of an alcohol to be subjected to catalytic reduction by using a palladium carbon catalyst. After the consumption of a theoretical amount of hydrogen the catalyst was filtered off, and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure, whereby 17g of a reaction crude product were obtained. Three point five grams of 2 3 ethoxycarbonylphenyl ureido 4 chloro 5 aminophenol were dissolved uniformly into a mixture liquid of 100ml of acetonitrile and 0.9ml of pyridine, and to this were added, with stirring at room temperature, 50ml of an acetonitrile solution containing 4.7g of α 4 butylsulfonylamidophenoxy tetradecanoyl chloride. After completion of the addition the reaction was continued for another hour, and then to the reaction liquid was added iced water, and ethyl acetate was used to obtain an extract from the liquid. After washing the extract the ethyl acetate phase was separated and then dried by use of sodium sulfate, and then concentrated under reduced pressure, whereby an objective extract was obtained. The reaction crude product was refined by used of silica gel and column chromatography, and solidified by use of hexane, whereby 3.7g of a white solid, m.p.146 149 C, were obtained.
