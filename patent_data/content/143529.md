# Multi function natural gamma ray logging.

## Abstract
A multi functional compensated spectral natural gamma ray logging method provides for determining formation and borehole characteristics directly from naturally occurring formation radia tion. The method, which measures formation lithology in open holes and mean casing thickness in cased wells, incorporates active compensation for differences in borehole conditions when calculating relative elemental formation abundacies or concen trations of potassium K , uranium U and thorium T .
