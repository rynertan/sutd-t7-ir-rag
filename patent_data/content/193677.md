# TREATMENT OF GAS MIXTURES

## Abstract
CO₂ is separated from a gas which contains CO₂ by dividing the gas into at least two parts and feeding at least two of the said parts into at least two CO₂ absorption zones through which a liquid absorbent for CO₂ is flowed in series countercurrently to the gas, recovering the gas from the said zones after reduction of its CO₂ concentration, recover ing liquid absorbent from the last zone and recycling it directly or indirectly to the first absorption zone after re moval of CO₂ from it.
