# APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR TESTING AND VERIFYING THE REFRESH LOGIC OF DYNAMIC MOS MEMORIES

## Abstract
The refresh logic of a dynamic MOS memory subsystem of a data processing system is tested by providing apparatus for counting refresh cycles and generating a counter output signal in a first state after a predetermined number of refresh cycles. A microprocessor periodically tests the state of the counter output signal and keeps a count of the number of times the counter output signal was tested and found to be in a second state. When the microprocessor tests and finds the counter output signal in a first state, the microprocessor com pares the number of times it tested and found the counter out put signal in a second state and determines if that count is within a predetermined range for correct operation.
