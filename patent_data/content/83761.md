# Output control device for light detectors for photometers.

## Abstract
A circuit for controlling output signals from two light detectors 12, 22 13, 23 in a photometer. The sensitivities of the light detectors 12, 22 13, 23 , or the gains in amplifiers 15 for amplifying output signals from the light detectors are controlled in such a manner that the sensitivity characteris tics and output characteristics of the two light detectors 12, 22 13, 23 are in agreement with one another, to thereby improve the measuring accuracy thereof. A device for controlling outputs from light detectors 12, 22 13, 23 for photometers, comprising a reference light source 62 for applying the modulated light having a predetermined fre quency to a light detector 12, 13 adapted to receive the light passing through an object sample 10 and a light detector 22, 23 adapted to receive the light passing through a reference sample 20 , two filter circuits 18, 28 adapted to detect such components of output signals from the light detectors 12, 22 13, 23 that are representative of the modulated light from the reference light source 62 , and a correcting and computing element 30 adapted to compare output signals from the filter circuits 18, 28 and correct the relative sensitivities of the two light detectors.
