# SIGNAL AND POWER APPLYING CIRCUITRY FOR MEMORY CASSETTES

## Abstract
When a memory cassette 3 having semiconductor memory is attached to or detached from a connector 2 mounted on an adapter 2, the supply of power to the memory cassette 3 through the adapter 2 is switched on or off and an interface signal between the memory cassette 3 and the adapter 2 is rendered active or inactive in response to connection or disconnection between the memory cassette 3 and the adapter 2. The stored content of the semiconductor memory can be protected against destruction which would otherwise result from application of a power supply voltage upon connection or disconnection between the memory cassette 3 and the adapter 2.
