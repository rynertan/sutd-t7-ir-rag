# Improvements in roller blinds.

## Abstract
A roller blind structure of the kind comprising an elongated tubular member 1 , having secured thereto one end of a fabric web 16 and being rotateably mounted in elongated openings 3 in two spaced apart brackets 4 so as to allow said tubular member to be also displaced towards and away from a window or the like and further having a flanged reel 7 secured to said elongated member 1 and a cord 10 which has one end thereof secured to said reel and wound up in a direction opposite to the winding direction of the web has a cover 19 , with elongated upper and lower walls 28a, b to form an elongated recess for receiving the flanged reel 7 , in a manner to allow it to be displaced with the tubular member. The cover further has in the lower wall 21 thereof an elongated opening 23 permitting the passage of the cord 10 in a substantially vertical direction independent of the actual displacement position of the reel. The elongated opening may have a widened portion 24 where the cord passes when the tubular member is in its innermost position. The cover 19 , is preferably intergral with one of the brackets 4 and the elongated opening then communicates with a transversal slot 33 to allow easy introduction of the cord.
