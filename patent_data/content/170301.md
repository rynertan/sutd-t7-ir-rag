# A METHOD AND AN APPARATUS FOR PROCESSING DOMESTIC REFUSE

## Abstract
A method of processing domestic refuse in which, after removal of coarse components from the refuse, first the organically rich fraction is separated therefrom, thereafter successively metal, paper, rags, glass, plastics and finally the lighter fraction, whereafter the residue is dumped or inciner ated. For the separation of the organically rich fraction, use can be made of a flat screen. Another possibility is to use two tandem arranged trommel screens having different mesh sizes.
