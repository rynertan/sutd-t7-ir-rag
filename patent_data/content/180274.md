# Electrical heating element.

## Abstract
An electrical heating element comprising a resistive element consisting of granular boron carbide packed in a quartz tube embedded in a piece of copper. A first power lead is electrically connected to the boron carbide at one end of the quartz tube. This first power lead passes through and is electrically insulated from the piece of copper. The second power lead is electrically connected to the boron carbide at the other end of the quartz tube, either directly or via the piece of copper. In use, connection of the first and second leads to an electrical power source causes the resistive element to generate heat in a very fast manner and to trandmit this heat to the piece of copper.
