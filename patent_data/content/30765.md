# Polygonal rotary scanners.

## Abstract
A polygonal shaped, multi faceted rotary scanner com prising a plurality of optically flat, reflective surfaces on facets 5 to 12 are integrally bonded to a multi faceted, polygonal base 4, at precise angles to the axis of rotation by a replication technique in which each optically flat reflective surface is produced on the surface of a flat master preform and the flat master preform is accurately located in position at the precise angle by contact with an upper and a lower facet of a master multi faceted polygonal fixture and the flat reflective surface is adhesively bonded to the corresponding facet of the polygonal base 4 , said polygonal base 4 being assembled concentrically between the upper and lower facets of the fixture prior to application of a small quantity of a liquid adhesive to the surface of the facets 5 to 12 of the polygonal base, which adhesive on hardening, adhesively bonds the reflective layers of the or each master preform to the appropriate facets of the polygonal base 4 .
