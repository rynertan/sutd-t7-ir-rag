# Exhaust system for internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
A part of an exhaust system 1 for an internal combustion engine has a valve 2 which can be moved by means such as a vacuum actuator 3 from a fully open inoperative position to an operative position in which it restricts the exhaust passageway by a variable amount. In the operative position, resilient means such as a coil spring 8 urges the valve to close the exhaust passage way against the pressure of exhaust gases, thereby increasing the backpressure on the engine in a controlled way. This is done on start up to reduce the warm up time of the engine and to reduce hydrocarbon emissions. When the engine has warmed up, the actuator 3 moves the valve to its inoperative position.
