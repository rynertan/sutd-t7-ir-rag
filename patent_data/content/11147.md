# Distillation method and apparatus for making motor fuel grade anhydrous ethanol.

## Abstract
An improved distillation method and apparatus are pro vided for obtaining motor fuel grade anhydrous ehtanol form fermentation or synthetic feedstocks. A three tower system is used comprising a stripper rectifier tower 10 in which the dilute feedstock is converted to a concentrated ethanol stream, a dehydating tower 11 in which water is removed from the concentrated ethanol stream by azeotropic distilla tion, and a stripper tower 12 for recovering the azeotropic agent maintaining a higher pressure in the stripper rectifier tower 10 than in the dehydrating tower 11 and the stripper tower 12 . The invention effects substantial energy savings by utilizing the heat content of the overhead vapors from the stripper rectifier tower 10 to supply the heat required for the dehydrating and stripper towers 11, 12 and by preheating the feedstock in stages utilizing the heat content of the over head vapors from the dehydrating and stripper owers 11,12 , the heat content of the overhead vapors from the stripper rectifier tower 10 , and the heat content of the bottoms from the stripper rectifier tower 10 . Provision is also made for separately removing lower boiling and higher boiling impurities from the stripper rectifier tower 10 which may be blended into the anhydrous ethanol product from the dehyd rating tower 11 .
