# Flow control device for a fluid dispensing apparatus.

## Abstract
An improved liquid dispensing apparatus 10 having a micro adjustment 14 of the opening travel of a needle valve 15 of the apparatus 10 . This micro adjustment 14 com prises a sleeve stop member 34 which is axially movable but non rotatable in the body of the apparatus 10 . One end of the sleeve stop member forms an end stop to opening movement of the needle valve 15 away from the valve seat 24 . Screw threads 76 of a first pitch P1 are formed on an external portion of the sleeve stop member 34 and internal screw threads 77 of a second pitch P2 different from the first pitch are formed on a portion of the apparatus body. A generally tubular adjustment screw element 35 is engaged with both the internal screw threads 77 of the body bore and the external screw threads 76 of the sleeve stop mem ber 34 so that rotation of the adjustment screw 35 element causes differential axial movement of the sleeve stop mem ber 34 for fine adjustment of the maximum opening needle valve travel.
