# Dual mode phase shift oscillator.

## Abstract
A phase shift oscillator comprising an amplifier 11,12 with a feedback loop 18,20,21 from the output to the input thereof, the feedback loop including a resonator such as a crystal 18 providing oscillation of the combined amplifier and resonator at a predetermined frequency. A balanced modulator 25 38 coupled to the amplifier generates a voltage varying at the same frequency, said voltage being selectively variable in amplitude from zero upward either in phase with the amplifier or 180 degrees out of phase therewith. The voltage is selectively inserted into the feed back loop 90 degrees out of phase with the output of the amplifier, whereby, when it is inserted, the frequency of oscillation of the amplifier varies from the predetermined frequency in direction depending upon the phase relation ship of the amplifier and voltage and in amount upon the amplitude of the voltage.
