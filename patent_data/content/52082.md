## Description
Building construction system The present invention relates to a building construction system using a plurality of rectangular building blocks which can be placed in superimposed horizontal courses.In particular, the construction system of the present invention is of the type in which each of the rectangular blocks has upper and lower faces having the same configuration, and two end faces having the same configuration a central aperture which extends through the block from the upper face to the lower face and is symmetrical about a median plane of the block parallel to the end faces, and two recesses formed in respective end faces of the block, each identical to one of the two halves into which the aperture is divided by the median plane the upper face and the lower face each having a pair of flat parallel surfaces which are spaced from one another and disposed laterally of the aperture and the recesses, and a depression including two spaced apart channel portions adjacent the flat surfaces, and a flat central raised portion with two holes which extend through the block, each in a region intermediate a recess and the central aperture, and which are intended to receive blocX oositioning pins the apertures, recesses and depressions of blocks of superimposed courses being adapted to define a network of intercommunicating vertical and horizontal channels intended to be filled with cast concrete the system further comprising a plurality of blockpositioning pins each of which can be inserted at its ends into facing holes of two adjacent blocks of two adjacent courses.A construction system of the aforesaid type is described and illustrated in U.S. Patent o. 4,110,949.The object of the present invention is to improve this knoTmn system so as to further increase its functionality and practicality.In order to achieve this object, the construction system according to the present invention is characterised by the fact that each of the two holes provided in the block to receive the positioning pins has a crosssection of oval shape the major axis of which is directed parallel to the longitudinal axis of the block, so that each block is displaceable slightly in a direction parallel to its longitudinal axis with respect to positioning pins inserted in the holes of the block.In the construction system according to the invention, any possible variations in the dimensions of different blocks, due to manufacturing tolerances, can be allowed for during the positioning of each course of blocks, by virtue of the possibility of adjusting the position of each block in a longitudinal sense with respect to the positioning pins inserted in the lower ends of the holes of the blocks.A further characteristic of the construction system according to the present invention lies in the fact that each of the rectangular blocks has a series of auxiliary holes which extend from the upper face to the lower face of the block, these holes being at least partly filled by excess material during the stamping operation necessary for forming the depressions in the upper and lower faces of the block.The rectangular blocks forming part of the construction system according to the present invention are made by successive operations. By a first extrusion operation there is formed a strip having a section corresponding to the plan form of each block. All the holes, recesses and apertures which extend from the upper face to the lower face of the block are formed by this operation.After the strip is divided into a plurality of separate blocks by a cutting operation, each block is subjected to the stamping operation which forms the depressions in the supper and lower faces of the block. The abovementioned auxiliary holes are also formed in the extrusion operation. During the subsequent stamping stage, these auxiliary holes are at least partly filled with material which is in excess of the quantity necessary for obtaining the block. This allows blocks to be produced having dimensions within relatively restricted tolerances.Another characteristic of the construction system accord ing to the invention lies in the fact that each of the positioning pins has a tubular body provided with an intermediate annular flange and a series of substantially radial fins the height of which decrease towards the ends of the tubular body. In particular, the substantially radial fins are directed tangentially to a notional cylinder coaxial with the pin and having a smaller diameter than the diameter of the tubular body. D.ue to this characteristic, each positioning pin can be easily introduced into the corresponding hole.Further characteristics and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description, made with reference to the attached drawings, provided purely by way of non limitative example, in which Figure 1 is a perspective view of a rectangular building block forming part of the construction system according to the present invention Figure 2 is a plan view of the block of Figure 1 Figure 3 is a sectional view which illustrates two superimposed rectangular blocks Figure 4 is a section. of the strip formed by the extrusion operation necessary for the manufacture of blocks of the construction system according to the invention Figure 5 is a sectional view which illustrates a series of blocks of the type illustrated in Figure 1 superimposed above one another Figures 6, 7 are respectively a perspective view and a plan view of the positioning pin usable for the positioning of blocks forming part of the construction system according to the present invention Figure 8 is a plan view of a course of blocks Figure 9 is a perspective view of a building.block forming part of the construction system according to the invention, and Figures 10 to 22 illustrate different types of blocks derived from the basic type shown in Figure 1 and forming part of the construction system according to the inventionIn Figures 1 and 2, there is generally indicated a rectangular building block 1 having an upper face 2, a lower face 3, two end faces 4 and two side faces 5. The upper face 2 and the lower face 3 of the block 1 have an identical configuration. The end faces 4 are also identical with one another. The block 1 has a central aperture 6 which extends through the block from the upper face 2 to the lower face 3. The central aperture 6 is delimited by four flat surfaces perpendicular to one another and orthgonally disposed with respect to a plane parallel to the upper face 2 and the lower face 3 of the block 1.As illustrated in Figure 2, the cross section of the central aperture 6 is symmetrical about a median planeX X parallel to the end faces 4 of the block 1.The end faces 4 of the block have two recesses 7 each identical to one of the two halves into which the central aperture 6 is divided by the median plane X X. The side face 5 of the block 1, which is intended to face outwardly of the building, has a further projecting flat surface 8 having an aesthetic function.The upper face 2 and the lower face 3 each have a pair of flat parallel surfaces 9 spaced from one another and extending laterally of the central aperture 6 and the recesses, 7. Moreover, each of the faces 2, 3 has a longitudinal depression 10 extending between the two flat parallel surfaces 9. The depression 10 includes two channel portions 11 spaced from one another and adjacent the flat surfaces 9, and a central flat raised portion 12 extending between the two channel portions 11.The two holes 13, which extend through the block from the upper face 2 to the lower face 3, open into the flat raised portion 12 of the depression 10. The axis of each hole 13 is directed perpendicularly with respect to the plane of the faces 2, 3 and is disposed in a region intermediate the central aperture 6 and a respective recess 7. The holes 13 are intended to receive positioning pins at their ends, one of these pins is illustrated in Figures 6 and 7 and is generally indicated 14.With reference to Figures 6 and 7, each positioning pin 14 comprises a tubular body 15 provided with an intermediate annular flange 16 and a series of fins 17 directed tangentially with respect to a notional cylinder coaxial with the pin 14 and having a diameter smaller than the diameter of the tubular body 15. Each fin 17 has an end portion the height of which decreases towards the ends of the tubular body 15. The positioning pins 14 allow the rectangular blocks forming part of the construction system according to the invention to be placed in superimposed horizontal courses in a simple and rapid manner.The blocks are laid dry, and are staggered relative to each other so that, as illustrated in Figure 5, the end faces 4 of each block are located in correspondence with the median plane X X of the underlying block. Once a course of blocks has been positioned, the positioning pins 14 are inserted into the upper ends of the holes 13 of the blocks. In this way it is possible to proceed in a rapid manner to lay a further course of blocks. The intermediate annular flange 16 of each positioning pin 14 rests on the raised flat portion 12 of the corresponding block.Each of the holes 13 has a cross section of oval shape with its major axis directed parallel to the longitudinal axis of the block. Therefore, once a block is positioned on the positioning pins projecting from the underlying blocks, it is possible to displace the block slightly in a direction parallel to its longitudinal axis with respect to these positioning pins. This allows any dimensional variations between the various blocks, due to manufacturing tolerances, to be compensated for during the positioning of the course of blocks.The fins 17 provided on each positioning pin facilitate the insertion of the pin into its respective hole, this insertion being effected by twisting the pin anti clockwise with reference to Figure 7 .As illustrated in Figures 3 and 5, once the rectangular blocks are positioned in superimposed horizontal courses, the aperture 6, the recesses 7 and the depressions 10 of the various blocks form a network of vertical and horizontal channels intended to be filled with a casting of concrete in such a way as to form a reinforcing structure able to retain the various blocks in position.As illustrated in Figure 3, each of the horizontal channels defined by the depressions 10 which face each other form two channels of substantially circular section connected by a central flat portion. These channels may be used to accommodate conduits for electrical conductors or else may contain reinforcing rods in the case of earthquake resistant structures.Given that the rectangular blocks forming part of the construction system according to the invention are laid dry and located with the aid of the positioning pins 14, the positioning of these blocks is extremely simple and rapid and can be performed even by non skilled personnel.The particular configuration of the positioning pins 14 described above facilitates their insertion into the corresponding holes 13. Further, the oval sectional shape of the latter allows the various blocks to be displaced in such ajway as to compensate for possible dimensional differences due to manufacturing tolerances.In order to make the blocks forming part of the construction system according to the present invention it is necessary, first of all, to perform an extrusion operation by means of which there is obtained a strip having a cross section like that illustrated in Figure 4.As illustrated, the central aperture 6, the end recess 7, the holes 13, and a series of auxiliary holes 18 are formed by the extrusion operation. Subsequently, the strip is cut along planes perpendicular to its longitudinal axis in such a way as to form separate blocks.Each of these blocks is then subjected to a stamping operation to produce the depressions 10 on the upper face 2 and the lower face 3. During this stamping operation, the excess material fills the auxiliary holes 18 and thus allows a block with dimensions within relatively restricted tolerances to be obtained.Naturally, the construction system according to the present invention provides blocks derived from the basic block described above, in such a way as to allow the formation of courses having any configuration which may be required. The different types of blocks are illustrated in Figures 10 to 22 with the reference numerals 30 to 43.Figure 8 illustrates a course 19 formed not only with the basic blocks 1 but also with blocks having a different configuration. All the blocks however, have a depression on the upper face and the lower face, at least one aperture extending from the upper face to the lower face and at least one hole for the insertion sofia positioning pin. In this way, once positioned dry with the aid of the positioning pins, these blocks 2 define a network of vertical and horizontal channels which are then filled with poured concrete.Figure 9 illustrates a block 43 forming part of the construction system according to the present invention provided with a flat sided slot 21 lying in a plane perpendicular to the plane of its upper and lower faces and extending from one of the holes 13 to a side face 5. The block 20 illustrated in Figure 9 is positioned for the mounting of an accessory 22 which, forming part of the construction system according to the invention, supports the hinges of a door. The accessory 22 comprises a tubular body 23 which is inserted in the hole 13 in place of the positioning pin, and a plate 24 which is disposed in the slot 21 and supports a projecting hinge 25. Figure 9 illustrates only one example of a construction block provided with an accessory intended to make the building operation easier and more rapid. It is evident, in fact, that different types of accessories can be positioned in such a way as to make the use of the construction system according to the invention even easier and more effective.Naturally, while the principal of the invention remains the same, details of construction and the embodiments can be varied widely with respect to what has been described and illustrated purely by way of non limitative example, without by this departing from the scope of the present invention.
