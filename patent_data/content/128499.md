## Description
The present invention relates to a memory composed of MOSFETs i.e., metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors according to the first part of claim 1 and, more particularly, to a technique which is effective for a dynamic type RAM i.e., random access memory made detective of changes in an address signal for generating a timing signal necessary for the operation of an internal circuit. The Inventor has conceived a pseudo static type RAM, which is constructed to detect changes in an address signal for generating a variety of timing signals necessary for the operations of an internal circuit thereof, prior to the present invention. This pseudo static type RAM has memory cells composed of capacitors for storing data in the form of charges and MOSFETs for address selections and has its peripheral circuits composed of CMOS i.e., complementary MOS static type circuits. This RAM has such external characteristics as can be deemed to be identical to those of the static RAM because, in response to the changes in the address signal detected, the various timing signals necessary therefor are generated. In this case, the following problems are encountered, as has been revealed by investigations. The changing timings of the individual address signals of plural bits fed to the RAM are caused to possibly fail to be synchronized to one another by the undesired timing discrepancies, which are encountered by a circuit itself such as a CPU i.e., central processing unit for generating those address signals, or by the unevenness in the signal delay of the printed circuit board. If the timing discrepancies e.g., skews are encountered in the changes in the address signals of plural bits fed to the RAM, there arises a fear that a word line selecting operation may be restarted by an address signal which changes with a delay after the word line selection is started. In case data to be read out from a dynamic type memory cell such as one MOSFET cell, the level of the holded data in the memory cell selected is changed to an insufficient level by the charge sharing which is caused between the capacitor of that memory cell and the capacitor existing in the data line with which the memory cell is connected. In other words, the data holded in the memory cell are substantially broken. Therefore, the data at minute levels, which are read out from the memory cell, are amplified to the desired levels by a sense amplifier, as is well known in the art. The data thus amplified are rewritten in the memory cell. If the word line selecting operations are started many times within a short period of time by the skews of the address signal, the switching of the word lines is executed in response thereto before the data levels, being substantially broken by the read out operation, are rewritten in the corresponding memory cell with the status in which the data levels are amplified to the desired levels. This results in the serious problem that the stored data are broken. From EP A 0 017 990, an integrated memory circuit is known in which the selection of the word lines is inhibited for a predetermined period of time after a first change of the address signal has been detected. This measure alone however does not prevent a data loss of a dynamic memory in case the address signal is not stable after the predetermined period of time has passed. An object of the present invention is to provide a MOS memory which can operate normally without being affected by the changed timing and fluctuations of an address signal. Another object of the present invention is to provide a MOS memory which can ignore address skews. Still another object of the present invention is to provide a pseudo static type RAM which can operate at a high speed. The objects are solved by the characterising features from part two of claim 1. Briefly described, an address buffer is made not to receive an address signal after a word line selecting operation at the latest by being given a gate function. Preferred embodiments of the invention are shown in the drawing, wherein Fig. 1 is a block diagram showing an RAM according to an embodiment of the present invention. Each circuit block enclosed by two dotted chain lines in Fig. 1 is formed in a single semiconductor substrate of silicon or the like by the technique of fabricating a well known CMOS i.e., complementray MOS integrated circuit. The RAM is provided with external terminals DO to D7, A0 to A14, Although not limitative, the integrated circuit is formed in a semiconductor substrate of single crystal P type silicon. Each of the N channel MOSFETs is constructed of source and drain regions which are formed in the surface of that semiconductor substrate and a gate electrode of polysilicon, which is formed on the surface of the semiconductor substrate between the source and drain regions through a relatively thin gate insulating layer. Each of the P channel MOSFETs is formed in an N type well region which is formed in the surface of the semiconductor substrate. As a result, the semiconductor substrate forms a substrate gate which is shared with the plural N channel MOSFETs formed thereon. The N type region forms the substrate gate of the P channel MOSFETs which are formed thereon. The substrate gate, i.e., the N type well region of the P channel MOSFETs is connected with the power supply terminal Vcc of Fig. 1. The common substrate gate, i.e., the semiconductor substrate of the N channel MOSFETs is connected with the output terminal of a back bias voltage generator Vbb G so that they are biased to a negative voltage by the latter. In the RAM of the present embodiment, each of the circuits such as a sense amplifier, precharging circuits, address decoders or a column switch is composed of a plurality of unit circuits. Fig. 2 shows one example of each unit circuit. Therefore, the specific circuits of the individual circuit blocks of Fig. 1 should be referred to Fig. 2. Indicated by circuit symbol M ARY in Fig. 1 is a memory array in which memory capacitors and well known one MOS type memory cells of address selecting MOSFETs are arranged in a matrix form. In the present embodiment, the memory array M ARY is a folded bit line system, although not limitative thereto. Accordingly, each memory cell has its input and output nodes connected with either of a pair of parallel complementary data lines D and Indicated by circuit symbol PC1 is a precharging circuit which has its unit circuit composed of a precharging MOSFET Q5 which is responsive to precharge pulses pcr for short circuiting the complementary data lines D and Indicated by circuit symbol SA is a sense amplifier which is constructed of a CMOS i.e., complementary MOS latch circuit having its individual power switch MOSFETs connected between the power supply voltage Vcc and the earth potential Vss of the circuit, although not limitative thereto. The paired input and output nodes of the CMOS latch circuit are connected with the complementary data lines D and The precharging operation of the memory array of the present embodiment is executed merely by short circuiting the paired complementary data lines likewise common complementary data lines to be described later The level change of the complementary data lines is small when the precharging operation is executed, as compared with the dynamic type RAM of the prior art, in which the voltage is charged up from 0 volt to the level Vcc. The precharge MOSFETs are turned conductive in a sufficient unsaturated state even if their gate voltages are set at the usual logic level i.e., Vcc . As a result, the precharging operation can be conducted at a high speed and with a low power consumption. Since the precharge level is set at the intermediate level of about Vcc 2, as in the above, the switch MOSFETs of the memory cell are rendered conductive in the sufficient unsaturated state even if their gate voltages i.e., the word line selection voltages are set at the usual logic level i.e., Vcc . As is different from the dynamic type RAM of the prior art, therefore, all the charges can be read out from the data storage capacitors without using any bootstrap voltage. The read out reference voltage required for operating the sense amplifier SA makes use of the precharge level on one data line through which the memory cell is not selected. As is different from the dynamic type RAM of the prior art, therefore, no dummy cell for generating the read out reference voltage may be required. Incidentally, the timing signals pal and Indicated by circuit symbol C SW is a column switch which is adapted to be controlled by a column selection signal generated by a column address decoder C DCR. In response to the column selection signal, the column switch C SW connects the complementary data lines to be selected with the common complementary data line. Indicated by circuit symbol R ADB is a row address buffer which receives external address signals of 9 bits through the external terminals A0 to A8 to thereby generate internal complementary address signals a0 to a8 and Indicated by circuit symbol C ADB is a column address buffer which is made responsive to external address signals of 6 bits through the external terminals A9 to A14 to generate the internal complementary address signals a9 to a14 and Indicated by circuit symbol R DCR is a row address decoder which is responsive to the internal complementary address signals The column address decoder C DCR is responsive to the internal complementary address signals Indicated by circuit symbol PC2 is a precharging circuit of the common complementary data line, which is composed of MOSFETs made similar to those of the above precharging circuit PCl for short circuiting the common complementary data line in response to precharge pulses pcd, although not limitative thereto. Indicated by circuit symbol MA is a main amplifier which has a circuit structure similar to that of the sense amplifier SA. Timing pulses mal and Indicated by circuit symbol DIB is a main input buffer which is responsive to the write timing pulses rw to transfer the write data from the external terminals D0 to D7 to common complementary data lines CD and The above various timing signals are generated by the following individual circuit blocks. Indicated by circuit symbol REG is a row address transient detector or an edge trigger circuit which is responsive to address signals a0 to a8 or Indicated by circuit symbol CEG is a column address transient detector or an edge trigger circuit which is responsive to address signals a9 to a14 or The row address transient detector REG is composed, although not limitative, of exclusive OR circuits which may receive the address signals a0 to a8 and their delayed signals, and OR circuits which may receive the output signals of those exclusive OR circuits. In response to the individual address signals, specifically, there are provided exclusive OR circuits which may receive the address signals and their delayed signals. In this case, nine exclusive OR circuits are provided to correspond to the fact that the address signals have 9 bits. The output signals of these nine exclusive OR circuits are input to the OR circuits. Accordingly, the row address transient detector or edge trigger circuit REG generates edge detection pulses r synchronized with the changing timings of those address signals a0 to a8. The column address transient detector or edge trigger circuit CEG has a structure similar to the row address transient detector REG. Specifically, the column address transient detector CEG is composed of exclusive OR circuits, which may receive the address signals a9 to a14 and their delayed signals, and OR circuits which may receive the output signals of those exclusive OR circuits. The column address transient detector CEG, likewise the row address transient detector REG, generates edge detection pulses c synchronized with the changing timings of those address signals a9 to a14. Indicated by circuit symbol TG is a timing generator which is operative to generate the above mentioned major timing signals. Specifically, the timing generator TG generates the above mentioned serial timing pulses in response to the edge detection pulses r and c, the write enable signals The individual timing pulses, i.e., the timing pulses pcr, The row timing pulses are outputted each time the row address transient detector REG generates the detection pulses r despite of the level of the chip selection signals On the contrary, the column timing pulses have their outputs controlled by the chip selection signals The multiplexer MPX is controlled in response to a control signal ref coming from a later described automatic refresh circuit REF. The multiplexer MPX selectively transmits the internal complementary address signals The substrate bias voltage generator Vbb G generates a negative back bias voltage V The automatic refresh circuit REF is composed, although not shown, of a timer which is controlled by the refresh control signal The timer of the automatic refresh circuit REF is started, although not limitative, when the chip selection signal The timer generates, when the refresh control signal In Fig. 2, each memory cell is composed of an address selecting N channel MOSFET Qm and a memory capacitor Cs. Each memory cell is arranged at each of the nodes of word lines W₀ to W₃ and the data lines D and The unit circuit of the sense amplifier SA is composed of P channel MOSFETs Q7 and Q9 and N channel MOSFETs Q6 and Q8. For the plural unit circuits constructing the sense amplifier SA, there are provided common power switching MOSFETs Q10 to 013. The MOSFETs Q10 and Q12 are made to have relatively small conductances, when they are turned conductive, by suitably setting the channel width and length. On the contrary, the MOSFETs Q11 and Q13 are made to have relatively large conductances when they are turned conductive. The MOSFETs Q10 and Q12 have their gates fed in their operating cycle with the complementary timing pulses pal and The precharging circuit PCl is constructed of a unit circuit which is composed of the N channel MOSFET Q5. The power switch MOSFETs Q10 and Q13, which are connected with the sense amplifier SA, are turned off immediately before the precharging operations of the complementary data lines D and The row address decoder R DCR of Fig. 2 is divided, although not limitative, into a first row decoder R DCRl and a second row decoder R DCR2. The second row decoder R DCR2 is constructed of a plurality of unit circuits corresponding to the four word lines, respectively. In Fig. 2, there are shown the unit circuits which correspond to the word lines W₀ to W₃. The unit circuit of the second decoder R DCR2 is composed, as shown, of a NAND circuit of CMOS structure having N channel MOSFETs Q32 to 34 and P channel MOSFETs Q35 to Q37 which may receive the address signals The first decoder R DCRl is composed, although not specifically shown, of a decoder for decoding the complimentary address signals a0, The structure of dividing the row address decoder provides the following advantages. Specifically, the number of the circuit elements of the decoder to be arranged on the semiconductor substrate in correspondence to the word lines may be reduced. Accordingly, the pitch of the unit circuits composing the second decoder R DCR2 may be matched with that of the word lines so that no waste space is formed on the semiconductor substrate. Between the individual word lines and the grounded point of the circuit, there are provided N channel MOSFETs Q20 to Q23 which are switched by the output of the NAND circuit. The individual word lines are grounded to the earth through those MOSFETs Q20 to Q23. Between the individual word lines and the grounded point of the circuit, moreover, there are provided N channel MOSFETs Q1 to Q4 which are switched by the reset pulses pw. These reset pulses are set at a high level immediately before precharging pulses pcr are raised to the high level. The unit circuit of the column switch C SW is composed of N channel MOSFETs which are switched by the output of the address decoder, as shown. The precharging circuit PC2 is composed of an N channel MOSFET Q51 which is switched by the precharging pulses pca. The pseudo static type RAM of Fig. 1 can be operated without any use of the chip selection terminal Fig. 3 shows the circuit of the RAM in case the chip selection terminal Fig. 4 shows the circuit of the two RAMs in case the chip selection terminal Fig. 5 shows a specific circuit diagram of the row address buffer R ADB of Fig. 1. The present embodiment is additionally given the following gate function so as to prevent the stored data from being broken by the address skews. Specifically, the signal from the external address signal terminal Ai is inputted to the CMOS inverter which is composed of a P channel MOSFET Q40 and an N channel MOSFET Q41. Between the two MOSFETs Q40 and Q41 and the power supply terminal Vcc and the grounded point, respectively, there are connected a P channel MOSFET Q42 and an N channel MOSFET Q43 which provide power switching means. As a result, the MOSFETs Q40 to Q43 compose substantially one clocked inverter CIVl. The gate function is added by applying the timing signals The output of the inverter IV2, which is composed of the MOSFETs Q45 and Q46, is fed back to the input of the inverter IV2 through a clocked inverter CIV2 which is composed of MOSFETs Q47 to Q50 likewise the above mentioned input circuit. In order to latch the address signals when the input circuit is closed, the MOSFETs Q49 and 50 as the power switch means have their gates fed with the timing signals cs and The summary of the operations of the circuit of the present embodiment will be explained in the following with reference to the timing chart of Fig. 6. Incidentally, the more detailed construction of the timing generator TG and the timings of the various timing pulses will be explained hereinafter with reference to Figs. 9 to 11. If the address signals are varied, as shown at A and B in Fig. 6, detection pulses el, e2 and so on synchronized with the edges of those signals are generated from the exclusive OR circuits corresponding to those address signals, respectively, as shown at D and E in Fig. 6. The edge detection pulses r c generated by those logic sums become pulse signals having pulse widthes according to the detection pulses sequentially generated, as shown at F in Fig. 6. The timing generator TG generates the necessary timing signals in synchronism with the leading and trailing edges of the detection pulses r. The word line selection timing signal x is set at the low level, as shown at G in Fig. 6, in synchronism with the leading edges of the detection pulses r. This word line selection timing signal x is raised to the high level by a predetermined delay circuit which has a time delay according to that of the operation of the circuit such as the address decoder. The word lines are selected in synchronism with the high level of the timing signal x. During the time period from the instant when the selecting operation of the word lines is started to the instant immediately after the operation of the sense amplifier SA of Figs. l and 2 is started, the read out voltage difference between the respective paired complementary data lines is still at the minute level. If the level of the word lines is returned during that period to the unselected level, the data to be holded in the selected memory cell are substantially broken. The selection during the insufficient period of the word lines may be effected as a result that the row address decoder R DCR responds to the address signal such as an address signal An shown at C in Fig. 6. More specifically, if the changing timing of the address signal An is relatively highly delayed, the row address transient detector REG of Fig. l generates the detection pulses r in response to the change of the address signal An. Assuming that there is no protecting function to be described in the following, consequently, the row address decoder R DCR is operated again by that address signal An. In accordance with the present embodiment, the gate of the address buffer of Fig. 5 is closed during the period before lapse of a predetermined period after the timing signal x is set at the high level, i.e., during the period after the selection of the word lines is started and before the read out voltage applied to the complementary data lines by memory cell selected is amplified to the sufficient level. In other words, the timing pulses cs and As a result, the stored data of the memory cells, which are being broken by the word line selecting operation, can be prevented from being broken, because the address signal, if any, such as the above mentioned address signal which will change with the large delay is not received. The stored data of the memory cells, which are being broken by the word line selecting operation, are caused to restore their levels by the rewriting operation i.e., the active restoring operation which is conducted when the word line selection timing signal x is raised to the high level by the bootstrapping operation. In other words, the same data are rewritten in the same memory cell. At the end of the rewriting operation, the timing signal cs is set at the high level, whereas the timing signal Incidentally, although not limitative, the timing signal cs is broken in synchronism with the rise of the timing signal x and is broken in synchronism with the fact that the timing signal x is set at the high level by the bootstrap effect. According to the present embodiment, the row address buffer R ADB is so controlled as to conduct the latching operation during the chip unselected period. As a result, the timing pulses cs are set at the low level in response to the fact that the chip selection signal This control method is effective in reducing the power consumption of the RAM because it prevents the unnecessary operation of the row address buffer during the chip unselected period. According to the present embodiment, although not limitative, the latching operation of the row address buffer is related to the operation of the column circuit such as the column switch C SW so as to prevent the deterioration of the data signal which is to be rewritten in the memory cells. More specifically, when at least one of the column address signals A9 to A14 to be fed to the RAM of Fig. 1 is changed as shown at C in Fig. 8, a column selection signal yi shown at D in Fig. 8 is outputted in response thereto from a column address decoder C DEC of Fig. 1. In response to the column selection signal yi, the column switch C SW connects one of the plural pairs of the complementary data lines with the common complementary data lines CD and Here, if the selecting operation of the word lines is executed during the level dropping period of the complementary data lines by the change of the row address signals A0 to A8, the rewriting level for the memory cells becomes insufficient. In the present embodiment, therefore, the timing pulses cs for controlling the row address buffer R ADB are set at the low level, as shown at E in Fig. 8, in synchronism with the period for which the level difference between the complementary data lines is reduced, namely, during a predetermined time period after the column selection signal yi is generated. Fig. 9 is a block diagram showing the edge trigger circuit i.e., the row address transient detector REG and the timing generator TG. The row address transient detector REG is constructed of exclusive OR circuits EX01 to EX02 corresponding one to one to the address terminals A0 to A8, as shown, CMOS inverters IV4 and IV5 acting as delay circuits, a CMOS NOR circuit NRl responsive to the outputs of the exclusive OR circuits EX01 and Ex02, and a CMOS inverter IV6. With the structure shown, when at least one of the address signals a0 to The timing generator TG is composed, although not limitative, of a row timing generator RTG for generating the row timing pulses, a column timing generator CTG for generating the column timing pulses, a fall detector for detecting the fall of the chip selection signal The row timing generator RTG is substantially operated by the OR signal which is generated by the logical sum of the detection pulses r of the row address transient detector REG and the detection pulses cs of the fall detector FD. The row timing generator RTG may have a structure similar to the timing generator of the dynamic type RAM, which is started by the row address strobe signal. The timing pulses pw, which are outputted from the row timing generator RTG, are raised to the high level when the OR signal of the pulses r and csd is outputted, so that the word line resetting MOSFETs Ql to Q4 shown in Fig. 2 may be rendered conductive during a predetermined time period after the output. The resetting of the word lines for preparing the word line selection is executed in response to the timing pulses pw. The timing pulses pcr are set at the high level at the timing, which is slightly delayed from the timing pulses pw, and is set at the low level at substantially the same timing as that at which the timing pulses pw are set at the low level. The timing pulses x are set at the low level at substantially the same timing as that at which the timing pulses pw are set at the high level. The timing pulses x are set at the high level, as shown at D in Fig. 11, after lapse of a predetermined period from the instant when the OR signal is changed to the low level. The timing pulses pal and pa2 are set, as has been described hereinbefore, at the low level at such a timing as slightly precedes the timing at which the timing pulses pcr are set at the high level, and are set at the high level after the timing pulses x are set at the high level. The timing pulses The timing generator XTG is composed, although not limitative, of a delay circuit DLYl, a bootstrap capacitor Cl, and a cutting MOSFET Q51. Thanks to the shown structure, the timing pulses x are raised to a high level near the power supply voltage Vcc, when the timing pulses x are raised to the high level, and to a high level exceeding the level of the power supply voltage Vcc after the delay time of the delay circuit DLYl. The column timing generator CTG is operated in response to the detection pulses c of the column address transient detector CEG, the chip selection signal The timing pulses pca, which are outputted from the column timing generator CTG, are raised to the high level for a predetermined period in synchronism with the change of the timing pulses x to the low level when the chip selection signal The timing pulses y are dropped to the low level, as shown at G in Fig. 11, in synchronism with the fact that the detection pulses c are outputted from the column address transient detector CEG. The changing timing of the timing pulses y to the high level is basically synchronized with the fall of the detection pulses c but is also affected by the timing pulses x . The timing pulses y are set at the low level, if the timing pulses x are at the low level, and are set at the high level after the timing pulses x are raised to the high level. The output of the column address decoder C DCR is reset as a fact that the timing pulses y are set at the low level, and has its level determined by the address signals The timing pulses mal, ma2, The timing pulses The timing pulses rw are set at the high level if the chip selection signal The rewrite timing generator HTG is responsive to the timing pulses y. The rewrite timing generator HTG is composed, as shown in Fig. 10, of a delay circuit DLY2 and a NAND circuit ND3. The timing pulses ih, which are generated by that generator HTG, are set at a high level, as shown at H in Fig. 11, when the timing pulses y are set at the low level, and set at the low level when a predetermined period elapses after the timing pulses y are set at the high level. The delay period after the timing pulses y are set at the high level and before the timing pulses ih are set at the low level is set, as has been described hereinbefore, in accordance with the period for which the level difference between the complementary data lines of the memory array is reduced. The specific circuit of the address inputting controller AIC of Fig. 9 is shown in Fig. 10. According to the circuit structure shown in Fig. 10, the pulses cs and The rewrite inputting generator HTG and the address inputting controller AIC of the present embodiment construct together a prohibitor for substantially prohibiting the changes of the word lines. The following effects can be obtained in accordance with the present invention. The present invention has been specifically described in connection with the embodiment thereof. However, the present invention should not be limited to the embodiment thus far described, but can naturally be modified in various ways without departing from the scope thereof. For example, the gate function possessed by the address buffer may be realized by a flip flop circuit, a normal logic circuit or a transmission gate MOSFET. Moreover, the specific circuit structure of the peripheral circuit constructing the pseudo static type RAM can be varied. Incidentally, the automatic refresh circuit need not always be required. In the description thus far made, the present invention has been explained in connection with a dynamic type RAM. However, the present invention should not be limited thereto but can likewise be applied to a MOS memory, in which the operating timing of the internal circuit can be generated by detecting the change of the address signals, for example, a static type RAM. This static type RAM shows effects similar to the aforementioned ones, because there arises the fear that the stored data are broken by a double selecting operation of the word lines.
