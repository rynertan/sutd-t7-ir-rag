# Improvements in or relating to body supports for use in a bed or seat.

## Abstract
A body support 20 for a bed or a seat having a plurality of resilient support members or springs 30 32,34,36 that are movable between a retracted or collapsed, inoperative position Figure 6 and an extended, operative position Figures 4 and 5 . The springs are contained in a case 20a,20b,20c of flexible sheet material so that when the springs are collapsed, the case is collapsed or depressed into a relatively thin layer for storage or other purposes and when the springs are extended the case will be distended by the springs to provide a resilient support such as a mattress 16 , box spring 20 or a combination thereof for use in a bed or seat. Actuating means is provided for actuating one or more of the springs 32,34 between the retracted and extended positions thereof, and connecting means 42,44,46 interconnects all of the springs to drive them from the retracted to extended positions. The body support is espe cially suited to sofa beds or other foldable bed or seat structures because the folding parts 12 of the latter structures are co ordinated with the body support 20 such that when the bed is folded into the storage position, the springs 30 will simultaneously be moved to their collapsed position contracting the surrounding case 20a, 20b, 20c into a relatively thin layer to enable the body support 20 to be stored within the confines of the associated structure, and when the sofa bed is unfolded to form a bed, the springs 30 will move to their extended position to provide resilient support.
