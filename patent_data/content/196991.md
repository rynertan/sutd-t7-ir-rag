# Downhole drilling motor.

## Abstract
A downwhole drilling motor of the progressive cavity type is disclosed and in which the rotor 27 is connected to the shaft 37 by a connecting rod assembly 33 . An upper connection 31 is nonintegral to, but connected to the upset section of a flexible rod, for connecting the rod to the motor. A lower connection is nonintegral to, but connected to the other upset end of the rod, for connecting the rod to the shaft. The three piece construction of the connecting rod assembly allows the flexible rod and the connections to be made of a different material. Thus, the connections can be large enough for connection to the rotor and to the shaft, and yet the flexible rod can provide adequate flexing in a shorter length. The flexible rod may also be protected by a protective covering.
