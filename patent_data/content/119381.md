# Commutation detection scheme.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for use in conjunction with a power conversion system employing a plurality of switching elements for controlling the electrical power supplied to a load from a source includes the sensing of the instan taneous voltage A furnished to the load and providing a signal representing the time derivative of the sensed volt age 32 . The derivative signal thus developed is compared with predetermined reference values 36, 40 to develop output signals which are logically combined to provide a final signal 60 representative of the instant in time at which one of the switching elements is commutated turned off .
