# Stowage receiver for fixed length rod.

## Abstract
A mounting bracket 38 for stowing an aircraft cowling support rod 18 in its standby position. The bracket has a swingable arm pivoted to fixed support. The arm carries a transverse, spool shaped shaft 62 configured to mate with the notched end 28 of the support rod so that the free end of the rod can be easily and securely attached to the shaft. A spring 60 biases the arm of the bracket toward swinging in the direction of the permanent attachment of the support rod to the aircraft, thereby automatically compensating for any variations in the length of the rod to insure that vibra tions of the rod do not occur during operation of the aircraft engine.
