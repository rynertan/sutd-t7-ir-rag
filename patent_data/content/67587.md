# Electrostatic recorders.

## Abstract
The electrostatic recorder comprises an electrode 6 recording on a recording medium 2 during a control signal, a comparator 26 comparing a digital input signal with each of a plurality of digital signals sequentially supplied from a memory 52 to detect equality therebetween, and control means 28 producing the control signal for a duration determined by the comparing operation. The electrode writes a full voltage to produce a high degree of consistency in the grey level density while duty cycle variation is effective to vary the separation between record segments by produc ing variable length segments within fixed recording time periods to achieve a grey scale record.
