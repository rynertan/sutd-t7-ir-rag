# Production of mechanically alloyed powder.

## Abstract
Mechanically alloyed powder is produced in a gravity de pendant ball mill by processing to a level at which the powder has a laminate type structure at 100X magnification. Consolidated products produced from the powder exhibit substantially the same desirable characteristics as are obtained form the consoli dation of attrited powders having a featureless microstructure and or saturation hardness.
