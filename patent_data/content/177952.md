# Vibration damping material.

## Abstract
A vibration damping material consisting of two metal plates and a vibration damping layer of thermoplastic resin interposed between the two metal plates, in which said ther moplastic resin has a percentage of elongation at 20 C of 30 or more, preferably 50 or more, a peak temperature of dissipation factor an Î´ in the range of 50 C to 130 C, and a bonding strength toward the metal plates of 3 kg cm or more as determined by 180 peeling test at 20 C.
