# Polychloroprene rubber composition.

## Abstract
Polychloroprene rubber is compounded with a filler comprising large particle, high structure carbon black and finely divided silica, and with a curant and plasticizer. Upon curing, articles are produced which exhibit high tear resis tance and low compression set and are admirably suited for high temperature, fatigue producing applications as suspen sion bushings.
