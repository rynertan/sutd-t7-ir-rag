# Method for calibrating a reflectometer.

## Abstract
Methods are disclosed for calibrating a reflectometer using black and white references observed in locations optically different from the sample location. Reflectance values of dark and light standards are measured in the sample location and such standards are read on a referee reflectometer having an ideal black and white references. The reflectances of the dark and light standards, as read on the referee reflectometer, are selected or adjusted to repre sent what the black and white references would have generated if they were read on the referee reflectometer, to produce calibrating factors in making reflectance readings in the subject reflectometer.
