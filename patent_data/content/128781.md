# COFFEE BREWING DEVICE AND METHOD

## Abstract
Coffee grounds are held in a housing 16 between porous walls 28 and 30 through which hot water in a cup reaches the grounds for brewing. The housing is divided into compart ments 50 58 by baffles 60 to 70 which retain the grounds but allow the passage of gases generated during brewing to a venting tube 34 formed by the hollow handle 18. The hous ing, especially the side wall 40, is preferably made of thin flex ible plastic so that it can be squeezed to extract the last drops of liquid.
