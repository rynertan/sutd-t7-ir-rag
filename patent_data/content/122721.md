# Method for producing a thermoplastic polymeric sheet.

## Abstract
In the production of a thermoplastic polymeric sheet 3 a molten thermoplastic polymer is extruded from an extrusion die 1 in the form of a sheet onto a moving quenching member 2 , with an electric potential difference being estab lished between the surface of the moving quenching member 2 and the extrusion die 1 , whereby the polymer is caused to electrostatically solidify and adhere to the surface of the quenching member 2 . The contact area of the polymeric sheet 3 with the moving quenching member 2 is held in an atmosphere of a gas which possesses better insulating prop erties than standard air, this gas issuing from a cylinder 9 through a nozzle 10 . By this means there can be produced, at higher speeds than conventional method, polymer sheets of high surface quality which avoids operational problems encountered in the conventional methods.
