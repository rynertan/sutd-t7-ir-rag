# System for sensing current in high voltage transmission lines utilizing the transmission of digital information by optical fibers.

## Abstract
A system and a method for sensing and reproducing a measured current value on a high voltage transmission line. An input shunt means 11 senses a current to be measured. A transmitter circuit transmits a sampled current value of the current passing through the shunt means. The transmitter has converter circuits 21, 22 for reproducing a composite output digital coded signal representative of the sample current value. A light transmitting output means 28, 29 is provided for transmission of the composite out put digital coded signal on an optical fiber transmission line 12 to a receiver circuit. The receiver circuit has de coding circuit means for decoding and reconstituting the coded signal to a usable form to determine the sampled current value.
