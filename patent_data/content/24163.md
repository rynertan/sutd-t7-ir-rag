# Pull tab with memory.

## Abstract
This disclosure relates to an easy opening container which includes a pull tab or strip which is formed of a plastics material having a memory and wherein the pull tab is so constructed that after it has been utilized to remove a panel portion, the memory automatically moves the tab and the removed panel portion to an out of the way position and holds the same in such a position, thereby not in any way interfering with the dispensing operation and while at the same time remaining attached to the container.
