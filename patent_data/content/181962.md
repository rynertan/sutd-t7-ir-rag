It will be understood that entrance gallery and venting gallery 161 and 163 are associated with cuvette celt ill and that entrance gallery 162 and and venting gallery 164 are associated with cuvette cell 112 hence, the entrance gallery 161 and venting gallery 163 operate as a pair and the entrance gallery 162 and venting gallery 164 operate as a pair.As may be best understood by reference toFIG. 15, and with regard to cell 112, the upper surface of the cell, provided by the lower surface 165 of the top 160, is inclined or angled to insure venting upon filling of the cell with a seeded culture growth liquid medium and in a manner explained in detail later, reflector 166, such as a strip of shiny metal or tape or other suitable surface treatment, is suitably adhered to the top 165 to reflect light from the photoemitter E2 to the photodetector D2 it will be understood t cell 111 is also provided with an inclined top and a reflector 167 as shown in FIG. 14 the reflector 1G7 is for reflecting light frozen the photoemitter El to the photodetector D1. The cuvette bottom 170, as shown in detail in FIGS. 14 19, is provided with a plurality of integrally formed, upwardly extending walls 171 176 defining cuvette cells 111 112 and the space 113 therebetween. The bottom 170 further includes upwardly extending integrally formed meniscus collimating lens 181 and 182 and integrally formed meniscus collecting lens 183 and 184.It will be understood that the collimating lens 181 and collecting lens 183 are associated with cuvette cell 111 and hence operate as a pair and that collimating lens 182 and collecting lens 184 are associated with cuvette cell 112 and hence operate as a pair it will be still further understood that collimating lens 181 and collecting lens 183 operate or function in cooperation with reflector 167 and that collimating lens 182 and collecting lens 184 operate or function in cooperation with reflector 176 6 as shown in FIG. 25.As is ,further shown in FIG. 19, the respective axes of the collimating and collecting lens 182 and 184 are disposed at suitable angles with respect to the reflector 166 shown in dashed outline but shown where the reflector 166 is positioned upon assembly of the cuvette top and bottom such that a beam or ray of light collected by lens 182 from photoemitter E2 is focused on the reflector 166 and the reflector reflects the received light along the axis of the collimating lens 184 to the photodetector D2, similarly with regard to collimating and collecting lens 181 and 183, reflector 167 and photoemitter El and photo detector Dl. The bottom 170 is provided with locating pins 188 189 to establish proper registration of the cuvette 110 with the electrical circuitry 130. The self sufficient incubation assembly may also be provided with a cap indicated by general numerical designation 150 and which cap is shown in detail in FIGS. 6 8. Generally, cap 150 has a dual function, namely it seals or closcs the cuvette 110 upon a seeded liquid culture growth medium being received therein for microosgallism cultivation and also interconnects the electrical circuitry 130 with the battery l il. Specifically, and refcrring to FIGS. 6 8, the cap includes a top 151, a plurality of radially disposed and downwardly extending members 153, 15 i and 155 for being received in correspondingly radially disposed and downwardly extending slots formed in the top 102 zof the assembly 100 as may be best seen in the upper lefthand portion of FIG. 8. Additionally, the cap 150 is provided with a pair of downwardly extending plug members 157 and 158 for respectively entering and sealing the entrance galleries 161 and 1G2 as is also shown in FIG. 2.It will be further understood that the cap 150 has two positions, the first position with the arrow 159 of the cap FIG. 6 not aligned with the arrow 119 provided on the top of the assembly as shown in FIG. 1 and in ,this position the cap does not interconnect the electrical circuitry 130 with the battery 144 and the cap is not locked to the assembly 100.However, upon the seeded liquid culture medium being placed in the cuvette 110 and operation of the assembly being desired, the cap is rotated 1800 to align the arrows 159 and 119 and the cap is inserted into the top portion of the assembly whereupon the plug members 157 and 158 seal the entrance galleries 161 and 162 and the downwardly extending member 154, as shown in FIG. 2, is provided with an inwardly extending slot or groove which is engaged by the outwardly extending resilient member 152, as shown, to loc1 the cap 150 to the top 102 of the assembly 100 to close and seal the assembly for incubation.Additionally, upon the arrows 159 and 119 being aligned and the cap inserted into the top of the as crnbly, the downwardly extending member 155, as may be best secn in FIG. 4, engat3es a spring moulted electrical connector 181 to force the ccnnector into engagement with the battery 144 to interconnect the battery 144 through the electrical connector 183 to the electrical circuitry 130 to energize the circuit and commence incubation. Referring again to FIG. 2, and to the upper lefthand portion, it will be understood that the top 112 is formed ,inwardly to provide a receptacle 200 which is provided at its bottom with an integrally molded pair of funnels 201 and 202 aligned vertically with the entrance galleries 161 and 162 of the cuvette 110. The operation of the self sufficient incubation assembly 100, and the present invention will now be described for use as a urinary tract infection kit although it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the present invention is not so limited but is of general use. As is further known to those skilled in the art, bacteria can be classified into two groups, Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria. As is further known to those skilled in the art, urinary tract infection is caused primarily by Gram negative bacteria such as Ecoli however, as is also known, urinary tract infection can be caused by Gram positive bacteria.While virtually all sampled urine contains some bacteria, the levels of bacteria of concern are those levels which are referred to in the art as clinically relevant levels of bacteria, for example 100,000 bacteria per ml, and it is the early detection of the presence of such clinically significant levels of bacteria that is the purpose of urinary tract infection detection apparatus in order that appropriate antibiotics can be prescribed and taken before the onset of a virulent bacterial infection. As is further knon to those skilled in the art, Gram negative bacteria reproduce fastner than Gram positive bacteria, Gram negative bacteria reproducing approximately every 20 minutes while Gram positive bacteria reproduce appro imately every 40 minutes, that is at approximately one half the rate of Gram negative bacteria. llcnce, with this reproduction information, bacteria in a urine sample from a urinary tract suspected of having an infection may be cultivated at a physiological temperature, such as for example 37 C or 98.60F, for a given period of time such as for example approimately four hours, and the bacteria level present at the beginning of the period per ml may be compared with the bacteria present per ml at the end of the period and the presence or absence of a clinically significant level of bacteria can be determined.In addition, by knowing the respective reproduction rates of Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria, and by comparing the respective growths of such bacteria over the time interval, the logical determination of the presence of a Gram negative infection or of a Gram positive infection can also be determined or clinically inferred. As is further known to those skilled in the art, the ,groth of bacteria in a sample, such as a seeded liquid culture growth medium, over a given period of time can be determined or measured by the use of a photometer such as a turbidity meter. At the beginning of the time interval, the optical density of the sample can be measured by passing a transilluminating beam or ray of light through the sample and the energy loss due to light scattering of the beam can be measured and recorded. Bacteria, as is known, upon growth or reproduction scatters light and as bacteria in the sample reproduce or proliferate such as in response to cul ,ivati ll, more light is scattered there by further increasing the optical density of the sample and hence at the end of the time interval the transilluminating bear. or ray can again be passed through the sample and the increased energy lusts caused by increased optical density or light scattering can again be measured and compared vis a vis the earlier measurement. The difference in energy level of the light beam can be used, empirically, and particularly knowing the reproduction rate of the bacteria present, to provide a measurement of bacteria growth in the sample over the time interval.It will be further understood that circuitry embodied in the monolithic chip 132 and the photoemitter and pllotodetector pairs El Dl and E2 D2 , in combination with the collimating and collecting lens and reflectors of the transparent cuvette 110 function as a photometer or turbidity meter. Referring now specifically to the operation of the present invention when used in a urinary tract infection kit, it will be presumed that a urine sample has been taken from a urinary tract suspected of having a urinary tract infection, that the urine sample has been diluted in a suitable liquid culture growth medium, such as eugonic broth, to seed the broth, that the cap 150 of the assembly 100 has been removed, and that the seeded liquid culture growth medium has been poured into thc receptacle 200 where it flows through the two funnels 201, 202 where it substantially divides and entcrs into the cells lll and 112 of the transparent cuvette 110.It will be understood that cell 111 has been preconditioned to grow only Gram positive bacteria by having a Gram negative inhibitor placed therein such as by coating the walls of cell 111 with sodium azide powder which, as known to those skilled in the art, inhibits the growth of virtually all Gram negative bacteria. However, cell 112 has not been so preconditioned anti hence both Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria will grow in cell 112. The cap 150 will then be placed into the receptacle 200 with the arrows 119 and 159 aligned to initiate operation of the assembly hy energization of the electrical circuit 130 as taught above.It will be understood that the monolithic chip 132 of the electrical circuitry 130, FIG. 10, may have a suitable circuit embodied therein to cause all of the photoemitters E3, E4 and ES to be temporarily activated, or activated in a predetermined sequence, to provide indication to the uscr that the self sufficient incubation assembly is functioning thereafter such photoclaitters will be extinguished and bacteria cultivation commenced and continued for a time interval. As is further known to those skilled in the art, to provide significant turbidity measurements at the beginning and end of the time interval, the photometer or turbidity meter must be baselined to provide appropriate measurement references against which future measurements may be measured or compared for significant results. Accordingly, the electrical circuitry 130 may be suitably baselined for significant measurements.Referring to FIG. 9, there is shown such baselining circuitry, indicated by general numerical designation 220, which may be used for such baselining, although illustrated as a block diagram in FIG. 9, it may be embodied in the monolithic chip 132 of FIG. 10 in a manner known to those skilled in the art. The baselining circuitry 220 is is a dual channel circuit including channel 230 associated with cuvette cell 111 and channel 240 associated with cuvette cell 112. Channel 230 includes the series connection of the photoemitter ii El, photodetector D2, amplifier Al, switching network S1, threshold comparator T1, start stop logic 232, counter 234, digital to analog converter 236 and amplifier A2 similarly, the channel 240 includes the series connected components as shown.Additionally, the baselining circuit includes the threshold comparators T3 and T4 connected to the decoder 250 ,which in turn is provided with three outputs as shown, for providing one of three binary outputs indicative of the bacteria conditions shown, namely no infection, Gram negative infection, or Gram positive infection. Continuing from above, it will again be presumed that the circuitry 130 has been energized by the battery 144 due to the closure of the cap 150 and now the operation of the baselining circuitry 220 and the decoder 250 for providing the bacterial infection indication shown will be described.With regard to .baselining channel 230, upon energization the switching network S5J1 assumes state S1 whereupon photoemitter El has no output land whence photodetector D1 has no input and therefore no output this lack of output will be reflected to amplifier Al and threshold comparator T1 will signal the start stop logic 232 to initiate counting which is then converted, digital to analog by the converter 236, boosted by amplifier A2, and reflected in a gradually increasing light level emanating from the photoemitter El. At such time the evoked response of the photodetector D1 reaches the preset level of threshold detcctor T1, the start stop logic is signalled to stop counting thus freezing the output level of the photoemitter El and channel 230 is now baselined similarly, channel 240 is also baselined to the preset level Of the threshold detector T2. At the conclusion of the cultiva tion time interval, for example approximately four hours, which time elapse is built into the circuitry of the monolithic chip 132 in a manner known to those skilled in the art, the switching ii network SWI assumes state S2 and the evokeel response of the photodetector D1 in response to the output of the photoemitter El ransilluminating the cuvette cell 111 is connected through amplifier Al to threshold comparator T3 and comparedwith its preset threshold level and if the later evoked response of the piiotodetector D1 falls below the threshold of threshold carparator T3 a ,binary 0 signal is transmitted to the decoder 250 to indicate the absence of clinically significant Gram positive bacteria RTI ID 17.7 growtii in cell 111. However, if the evoked response of the photodetector D1 is at least equal to or greater than the preset threshold of threshold comparator D3, a binary 1 signal is transmitted to the decoder 250 to indicate the presence of clinically significant Gram positive bacteria growth in cell 111.Similarly, threshold comparator T4 is preset to send a binary 0 or 1 signal to the decoder 250 to respectively indicate the absence of clinically significant. levels of Gram negative and or ,Gram positive bacteria growth in cell 112 or the presence of clinically significant levels of Gram negative and or Gram positive bacterial growth in cell 112.It will be understood that the preset threshold levels of the respective threshold comparators will be preset empirically and in accordance with the recognized respective reproduction and growth rates of Gram positive andGram negative bacteria, for example the preset threshold of threshold comparator T4 of channel 240 will be approximately twice the preset level of threshold comparator T3 of channel 230 since it is known that Gram negative bacteria grow at approximately twice the rate of Gram positive bacteria. The decoder 250 will interpret or decode the binary 1 or 0 signals received from the respective threshold comparators T3 and TI to provide an indication of bacterial growth in accordance with the algorithm, sometimes referr i to in the art as a truth table, set forth i l FIG. 11. It will be further understood that the al Jorithr . or trutk table of FIG. 11 will also be embodied in suitable circuitry included in the monolithic chip 132 of the electrical circuit 130. Referring now to the decoder algorithm of FIG. 11, upon the decoder 250 of FIG. 9 receiving the binary 1 from the output of cell 111 and a binary 0 from the output of cell 112, this will be interpreted and the appropriate photo emitter E4 illuminated to indicate the presence of clinically significant levels of Gram positive bacteria in the urine sample. Upon the . n .. decoder receiving a binary D from cell 111 and a binary 1 from cell 112, this will be interpreted by the decoder 250 to indicate the presence of clinically significant levels of Gram negative bacterial and photoemitter E4 will be illuminated to provide such indication. Should a binary 0 be.received from both cells, this will be decoded to indicate the absence of any clinically significant infection and photoemitter E3 will be illuminated to provide such visual indication. However, it is possible for the decoder to receive a binary 1 from both cell 111 and jcell 112 and, as indicated in FIG. 17, this is interpreted or decoded by the decoder 250 to indicate the presence of clinically significant levels of Gram positive bacteria. This results from one of two possible situations and the following loyic one possibility is that Gram positive bacteria were present in such large quantity or experienced such large growth during cultivation as to exceed both the preset threshold level of threshold comparator T3 of the Gram positive cell 111 and the preset threshold level of the threshold comparator T4 of theGram positive and or Gram negative bacteria cell 112 the other possibility is that there were mixed bacteria present, indicating the possibility or a mixed infection, and that the growth of the gram positive bacteria in cell 112 exceeded the threshold of threshold comparator T3 and t1at there was either i ed or Gram negative bacteria growth in cell 112 sufficicnt to exceed the preset threshold of threshold comparator T4. In such event, as known to those skilled in the art, treatment for Gram positive bacteria or Gram positive ifection is indicated.It will be noted from FIGS. 2, 4, and 5, and from FIG. 10 where cuvette 110, cell 111 and cell 112 are shown in dashed outline, that the electrical circuitry 130 and the temperature control element 135 are in lntimate physical contact with the cuvette 110 specifically the underside thereof.Hence, the temperature of the temperature control element 135 will be substantially the same as the temperature of the cuvette and the seeded culture growth medium contained therein whereby improved temperature control of the medium is provided, and the heat of operation of the electrical circuitry 130 will supplement the heat applied by the heating resistor 133 and battery 144 to the cuvette 110 and the seeded culture growth medium received therein whereby the energy required to be supplied by the battery 144 will be less than would be required were the electrical circuitry 130 to be located externally of the cuvette and not in intimate physical contact therewith. Referring again to PIG. 10, it will be understood that the photoemitter El of FIG. 10 and photoemitter 232 of FIG. 20 are positioned at the proper point along the optical axis of the respective collimating lens 181 of the cuvette 110 and collecting lens 212 of cuvette 210 to maximize collimation of the light eni tted by the photodetector for transilluminating the culture grc Lh medium received by the respective cuvette 110 and 210 and t e photodetector D1 of i. IC. 10 and the photodetector 233 of FIG. 20 are positioned along the optical axis of th respective collecting lens 183 and 211 to maximize the collection of the light transilluminating the culture growth medium and exiting the respective cuvette 110 or 210 for photometric measurement. It will be further understood by those skilled in the art that many modifications and variations of the present invention may be made without departing fro n the spirit and the scope thereof.
