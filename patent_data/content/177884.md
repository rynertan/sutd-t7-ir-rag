## Description
The present invention relates to a silver halide photographic light sensitive material, and more particularly to a silver halide photographic light sensitive material which is excellent in the layer s physical characteristics as well as in the raw stock preservability. A silver halide photographic light sensitive material hereinafter may be called light sensitive material unless confusion occurs is prepared so as to comprise photographic layers such as light sensitive silver halide emulsion layers and subsidiary function having various sub layers such as anti irradiation layer, antihalation layer, intermediate layer for intercepting the interlayer effect, filter layer, protective layer, and the like, while a silver halide color photographic light sensitive material hereinafter may be called color light sensitive material unless confusion occurs comprises silver halide emulsion layers containing couplers that will form specified spectral region colors conformed to a fixed order. The photographic layers of such light sensitive materials use a hydrophilic colloid such as gelatin as the binder thereof, and the binder is usually subjected to hardening treatment to meet the need of having the light sensitive material withstand recent high temperature high pH rapid processings and mechanical processings in automatic processors that tend to cause troubles such as scratches and pressure marks. The hardening treatment is essential for insuring the processed quality in the aspect of physical properties except for special cases, and as the agent for use in the hardening treatment various hardeners ranging from incipient inorganic compound hardeners such as potassium alum and chrome alum, to organic hardeners which are more highly adaptable to photographic characteristics have so far been studied and used to date. For example, the organic hardener includes those chlorotriazine type hardeners as described in U.S. Patent Nos.3,325,287, 3,645,743 and Japanese Patent Publication Open to Public Inspection hereinafter referred to as Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No.40244 1982, those vinyl sulfone type hardeners as described in U.S. Patent No.3,490,911 and West German OLS Patent No.2,749,260, and various other hardeners such as aldehyde type and epoxy type compounds. The hardener, on the assumption that it has a matter of course hardening effect, is required to have the characteristics that the hardening by the hardener be capable of producing a gloss on the surface of the layer of a light sensitive material, of making the layer well adhere to the support, of making progress fast, and of making the layer well resistant against scratching force and the hardener be harmless to photographic characteristics and have no possibility to cause any industrial hygienic or environmental pollution problems. In view of these requirements, for example, S triazine type hardeners are disadvantageous in respect that they lack rapid hardening ability, and vinyl sulfone type hardeners are also disadvantageous in respect that they are lacking in making the surface of the layer glossy as well as in making the layer adhere to the support and resistant against scratching force, whereas chlorotriazine type hardeners have at least satisfactory characteristics which meet the above physical characteristic requirements, as described in Japanese Patent Examined Publication No.6151 1972, Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication Nos.19220 1973, 78788 1976, 128130 1977, 130326 1977 and 1043 1981. The chlorotriazine type hardener, however, has a large disadvantage that, when it is used in a color photographic light sensitive material for making color prints, the preservability of the light sensitive material as a raw stock during the period from its manufacture up to the time when it is used hereinafter called raw stock preservability is so poor that the sensitivity of the light sensitive material is largely deteriorated with time. It is an object of the present invention to provide a silver halide photographic light sensitive material which is excellent in the raw stock preservability as well as in the layer s physical characteristics. As a result of our continued investigation it has now been found that the above object of the present invention is accomplished by a silver halide photographic light sensitive material, comprising wherein R₁, R₂ and R₃ each represents hydrogen, a halogen, a sulfonic acid group including the salts thereof, or a monovalent organic group A₁, A₂ and A₃ each represents nitrogen or a in which R₄ represents hydrogen, a halogen, a sulfonic acid group including the salts thereof or a monovalent organic group X₁ and X₂ each represents a hydroxyl group or a NR₅R₆ in which R₅ and R₆ each represents hydrogen, an alkyl group, an aryl group or an alkylcarbonyl group, or R₅ and R₆ may be coupled to each other to form a ring R₁, R₂, R₃ and R₄ may also be coupled to each other to form a ring, and at least one of the groups represented by R₁, R₂, R₃ and R₄ and at least one of the groups represented by R₅ and R₆ may further be coupled to each other to form a ring and each of n₁, n₂ and n₃ is an integer of from 0 to 3 wherein Z₁ represents chlorine, a hydroxy group, an alkyl group, an alkoxy group, an alkylthio group, a OM group in which M represents a monovalent metal atom, or a NR R group and NHCOR in which R , R and R each represents hydrogen, an alkyl group or an aryl group and Z₂ has the same definition as Z₁ except it does not include chlorine wherein Z₃ and Z₄ each represents chlorine, a hydroxy group, an alkyl group, an alkoxy group or a OM group in which M represents a monovalent metal atom Q and Q each represents an O , S or NH group L represents an alkylene group or an arylene group and l and m each represents 0 or 1 wherein R₂₃ represents an alkyl group or an aryl group R₂₄ represents an alkyl group, a cycloalkyl group, an aryl group or a heterocyclic group R₂₅ represents hydrogen, a halogen, an alkyl group or an alkoxy group, and R₂₅ may be coupled to R₂₃ to form a ring and Z₅ represents hydrogen or a group capable of splitting off through a reaction thereof to the oxidation products of an aromatic primary amine color devloping agent wherein R₂₆ represents a normal or branch chained alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms R₂₇ represents a ballast group Z₆ has the same definition as Z₅.

In addition, the monovalent organic group represented by each of the R₁₂, R₁₃, R₁₄, R₁₅ and R₁₆ is as defined in the monovalent organic group represented by each of the R₁, R₂, R₃ and R₄ in formula I .

The following are examples of the compound having Formula I , but the present invention is not limited thereto. The incorporation of any of the compounds having Formula I of this invention into a silver halide photographic light sensitive material may be made in the manner that the compound is dissolved in water or an organic solvent miscible in an arbitrary proportion with water such as methanol, ethanol , or dissolved into an organic solvent which may not be miscible with water, which solution is then dispersed into a hydrophilic colloid, and thus the compound, in either the solution form or the dispersed liquid form, is added to the silver halide light sensitive material. The adding quantity of the compound is preferably from 1.0x10 ⁴ to 1.0 mole per mole of silver halide, and more preferably from 1.2x10 ³ to 1.0x10 ¹ mole. The addition of the compound is allowed to be made at any point of time during the period between the preparation and the coating of the silver halide emulsion, and preferably between the completion point of the chemical ripening and the starting point of the coating of the silver halide emulsion. The place where the addition is to be made is the arbitrary light sensitive silver halide emulsion layer and or nonlight sensitive hydrophilic colloid layer, and preferably the layer comprising a light sensitive silver halide emulsion spectrally sensitized by use of a compound having Formula VII or VIII that will be described hereinafter and or the nonlight sensitive hydrophilic colloid layer adjacent thereto. The incorporation of the compound having Formula I of this invention into a silver halide emulsion layer is of the well known prior art and found in, e.g., British Patent No. 2,054,187, U.S. Patent Nos.3,582,333, 3,671,248, 3,902,905, 3,522,053 and Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication Nos.52743 1981, 28741 1983. The techniques described in these publications, however, are intended for the improvement of developability, the prevention of the occurrence of fog, and the like, and from the above prior art publications, the effect of improving the change in the sensitivity of the raw stock in storage intended in this invention was not expected at all. And Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No.176637 1983 discloses a technique of improving the sensitivity change of the raw stock in storage by the incorporation of a black and white developing agent in a quantity not exceeding 130mg per mole of silver halide into a specific sensitizing dye containing light sensitive material, but even though this method is applied to the present invention, the preservability of the raw stock in storage cannot be improved adequately, and therefore the method is unable to accomplish the object of the present invention. The alkyl group represented by each of the Z₁ and Z₂ of the foregoing Formula II includes, e.g., methyl group, ethyl group and butyl group and the alkoxy group includes, e.g., methoxy group, ethoxy group and butoxy group. The M of the OM group represented by each of the Z₁ and Z₂ represents a sodium atom or potassium atom. The chlorotriazine type hardeners having Formula II are those described in U.S. Patent No.3,645,743, Japanese Patent Examined Publication Nos.6151 1972, 33380 1972, 9607 1976, Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication Nos.19220 1973, 78788 1976, 60612 1977, 128130 1977, 130326 1977 and 1043 1981. From these hardeners any appropriate one may be selected in accordance with the foregoing basis and used in this invention. The alkyl group represented by each of the Z₃ and Z₄ of the foregoing Formula III includes, e.g., methyl group, ethyl group and butyl group the alkoxy group includes, e.g., methoxy group, ethoxy group and butoxy group and the M of the OM group represents a sodium atom or potassium atom. The alkylene group represented by the L of Formula III includes, e.g., CH₂ , CH₂ ₂ and CH₂ ₃ and the arylene group includes, e.g., p , o and m phenylene groups. The chlorotriazine type hardeners having Formula III are those described in Canadian Patent No.895,808, Japanese Patent Examined Publication No.33542 1983, and Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No.40244 1982. From these hardeners any appropriate one may be selected in accordance with the foregoing basis. Any of the compounds having Formula II or III , since it becomes normally diffused to be extended across the whole layers, may be added to at least one layer or a plurality of layers selected from the emulsion layers or subsidiary layers. The addition is carried out by adding a solution of the compound dissolved into water or an alcohol e.g., methyl alcohol or ethyl alcohol in a quantity of 1 1000mg, and preferably 5 50mg per gram of gelatin. The addition may be made by either the batch method or the in line method.

The R₂₅ and R₂₃ may combine with each other to form a ring. In the present invention, the alkyl group represented by the R₂₄ of Formula IX is, for example, a polyfluoroalkyl group, etc., substituted by a methyl, ethyl, butyl, hexyl, tridecyl, pentadecyl or heptadecyl group or a fluorine atom. The aryl group represented by R₂₄ is, for example, a phenyl group or naphthyl group, and preferably a phenyl group. The heterocyclic group represented by R₂₄ is, e.g., a pyridyl group or furan group. The cycloalkyl group represented by R₂₄ is, e.g., a cyclopropyl group or cyclohexyl group. These groups represented by R₂₄ may have a single substituent or a plurality of substituents. For example, typical substituents introducible to a phenyl group include halogen atoms such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine , alkyl groups such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, dodecyl , hydroxyl group, cyano group, nitro group, alkoxy groups such as methoxy, ethoxy , alkylsulfonamido groups such as methylsulfonamido, octylsulfonamido , arylsulfonamido groups such as phenylsulfonamido, naphthylsulfonamido , alkylsulfamoyl groups such as butylsulfamoyl , arylsulfamoyl groups such as phenylsulfamoyl , alkyloxycarbonyl groups such as methyoxycarbonyl , aryloxycarbonyl groups such as phenyloxycarbonyl , aminosulfonamido group, acylamino groups, carbamoyl group, sulfonyl group, sulfinyl group, sulfoxy group, sulfo group, aryloxy groups, alkoxy groups, carboxyl group, alkylcarbonyl groups and arylcarbonyl groups. Two or more of these groups may be introduced to a phenyl group. The preferred group represented by R₂₄ is a polyfluoroalkyl group, phenyl group or phenyl group having one or not less than two substituents which include halogen atoms, alkyl groups, alkoxy groups, alkylsulfonamido groups, arylsulfonamido groups, alkylsulfamoyl groups, arylsulfamoyl groups, alkylsulfonyl groups, arylsulfonyl groups, alkylcarbonyl groups, arylcarbonyl groups, and cyano group. In the present invention, the straight chain or branched chain alkyl group having from 1, preferably 2 to 4 carbon atoms represented by the R₂₆ of Formula X is, for example, an ethyl group, propyl group, butyl group, iso propyl group, iso butyl group, sec butyl group or tert butyl group. These groups each may have a substituent. The substituent includes acylamino groups such as acetylamino and alkoxy groups such as methoxy . However, the R₂₆ is desirable to be nonsubstituted. The ballasting group represented by the R₂₇ of Formula X is an organic group having such a magnitude and form as to provide coupler molecules with a bulkiness enough to make the coupler substantially unable to diffuse from the coupler containing layer into other layers. Typical ballasting groups are those alkyl or aryl groups having from 8 to 32 carbon atoms. These alkyl or aryl groups each may have a substituent. The substituent to the aryl group includes, e.g., alkyl groups, aryl groups, alkoxy groups, aryloxy groups, carboxy group, acyl groups, ester groups, hydroxy group, cyano group, nitro group, carbamoyl group, carbamido group, alkylthio groups, arylthio groups, sulfonyl group, sulfonamido group, sulfamoyl group and halogent atoms. And the substituent to the alkyl group includes the same substituents as those enumerated above except the alkyl groups. The particularly preferred ones as the ballasting group are those having the following Formula XI wherein R₂₈ is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having from 1 to 18 carbon atoms Ar is an aryl group, allowed to have a substituent. The substituent includes alkyl groups, hydroxy group and alkylsulfonamido groups. The most preferred one is a branched chain alkyl group such as a t butyl group. The group represented by each of the Z₅ and Z₆ of Formulas IX and X , respectively, which can split off as a result of the reaction with the oxidized product of an aromatic primary amine type color developing agent, is one well known to those skilled in the art, and acts advantageously by reforming the reactivity of the coupler and by splitting from the coupler to carry out functions such as development inhibition, bleach inhibition and color correction. Typical examples of the above group include, e.g., halogen atoms such as chlorine or fluorine, and substituted or unsubstituted alkoxy, aryloxy, arylthio, carbamoyloxy, acyloxy, sulfamoyloxy, sulfonamido, heteroylthio and heteroyloxy groups. The particularly preferred one of these examples represented by Z₅ or Z₆ is a hydrogen atom or chlorine atom. Further detailed descriptions about the above are found in Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication Nos.10135 1975, 120334 1975, 130441 1975, 48237 1979, 146828 1976, 14736 1979, 37425 1972, 123341 1975, 95346 1983, Japanese Patent Examined Publication No.36894 1973, U.S. Patent Nos.3,476,563, 3,737,316, and 3,227,551. The following are typical examples of those cyan couplers having Formula IX The following are examples of those couplers having Formula X The silver halide to be used in the photographic material of this invention includes any arbitrary ones used in ordinary silver halide emulsions such as silver bromide, silver chloride, silver iodobromide, silver chlorobromide, silver chloroiodobromide, and the like. The particles of these silver halides may be either coarse grained or fine grained, and the particle size distribution may be either narrower or wider. The crystal form of these silver halide particles may be either regular or twin, and those whose crystal is of an arbitrary 100 face 111 face proportion may be used. Further, the crystal of these silver halide particles may be of either homogeneous structure from the inside through outside or heterogeneous structure stratified with the inside and the outside. In addition, these silver halides may be of either the type of forming a latent image mainly on the particle surface or the type of forming a latent image inside the particle. Further, these silver halides may be ones prepared by any of the neutral method, ammoniacal method, and acid method. Also, silver halide particles prepared by any of the simultaneously mixing method, orderly mixing method, reversely mixing method and conversion method may be applied to this invention. The particle size is desirable to be in the range of from 0.1 to 1.0µ. The silver halide emulsion to be used in the photographic material of this invention should be one from which the water soluble salt is removed, but is also allowed to be one not desalted. And a silver halide emulsion produced by mixing two or more different emulsions each prepared separately may also be used in the photographic material of this invention. The silver halide photographic emulsion prepared by dispersing silver halide particles into a binder liquid may be sensitized by use of chemical sensitizers. The chemical sensitizers advantageously usable in this invention may be broadly divided into four groups noble metal sensitizers, sulfur sensitizers, selenium sensitizers and reduction sensitizers. The usable noble metal sensitizers include gold compounds and those compounds of rhuthenium, rhodium, palladium, platinum, and the like. In addition, when gold sensitizers are used, ammonium thiocyanate or sodium thiocyanate may be used together. The usable sulfur sensitizers include active gelatin and sulfur compounds.

The usable reduction sensitizers include stannous salts, polyamines, bisalkylaminosulfides, silane compounds, iminoaminomethanesulfinic acid, hydrazinium salts, and hydrazine derivatives. The silver halide emulsion, in order to be made sensitive to desired wavelength regions, may be spectrally sensitized by use of various sensitizers. The sensitizers suitably usable for this purpose include those cyanine dyes, merocyanine dyes and complex cyanine dyes as described in, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 1,939,201, 2,072,908, 2,739,149, 2,213,995, 2,493,748, 2,519,001, West German Patent No.929,080, and British Patent No.505,979, which cyanine dyes may be used alone or in combination. Such various spectral sensitizers may also be used for purposes aside from the intrinsic purpose thereof for example, they may be used for the prevention of fog, for the prevention of possible deterioration during the storage of the photographic characteristics of silver halide color photographic light sensitive materials, and for the development control e.g., gradation control . Further the particularly preferred sensitizing dye for in the photographic material of this invention are those having the following Formula VII and Formula VIII . wherein Y¹, Y², Y³ and Y⁴ each is an oxygen atom, a sulfur atom or a selenium atom A¹, A², A³, A⁴, B¹, B², B³, B⁴, C¹, C², C³, C⁴, D¹, D², D³ and D⁴ each is a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, an alkyl, alkoxy, phenyl, cyano, nitro or alkoxycarbonyl group, provided that at least one of A¹ B¹, B¹ C¹, C¹ D¹, A² B², B² C², C² D², A³ B³, B³ C³, C³ D³, A⁴ B⁴, B⁴ C⁴, and C⁴ D⁴ combinations may combine to form a benzene ring R¹, R², R³ and R⁴ each is an alkyl or aryl group R⁵ and R⁶ each is a lower alkyl group L¹, L² and L³ each is a methine group X The methine group CH represented by each of the L¹, L² and L³ is allowed to have a substituent, and the substituent includes straight chain or branched chain alkyl groups such as methyl, ethyl or alkoxy groups such as methoxy, ethoxy, etc. . The following are examples of the sensitizing dyes having Formula VII and Formula VIII . The addition of these sensitizing dyes is carried out by adding a solution of any of the sensitizing dyes at any point of time during the chemical ripening of the emulsion, or after completion of the chemical ripening, or before or after the addition of stabilizer and antifoggant. The adding quantity of the sensitizing dye, although no particular restrictions are placed thereon, is in the range of normally from 1 x 10 ⁶ to 1 x 10 ⁴ mole per mole of silver halide, and preferably from 5 x 10 ⁶ to 5 x 10 ⁵ mole. These sensitizing dyes may be used alone or in combination. Further, along with the sensitizing dye, a substance that exhibits a supersensitizing effect i.e., a supersensitizer, may, if necessary, be used. The component layers of the silver halide photographic light sensitive material of this invention may, if necessary, and within the range not to impair the effect of this invention, contain any of such chemical sensitizers as thioether compounds, quaternary ammonium salt compounds or polyalkylene oxide compounds, and any of such stabilizers as triazoles, azaindenes, benzothiazolium compounds, zinc compounds, cadmium compounds or mercaptan compounds.

Typical other cyan dye image forming couplers are those phenol type, naphthol type four equivalent and two equivalent cyan dye image forming couplers as described in, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 2,306,410, 2,356,475, 2,362,598, 2,367,531, 2,369,929, 2,423,730, 2,474,239, 2,476,008, 2,498,466, 2,545,687, 2,728,660, 2,772,162, 2,895,826, 2,976,146, 3,002,836, 3,419,390, 3,446,622, 3,476,563, 3,737,316, 3,758,308, 3,839,044, British Patent Nos.478,991, 945,542, 1,084,480, 1,377,233, 1,388,024, 1,543,040, Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication Nos.37425 1972, 10135 1975, 25228 1975, 112038 1975, 117422 1975, 130441 1975, 6551 1976, 37647 1976, 52828 1976, 108841 1976, 109630 1978, 48237 1979, 66129 1979, 131931 1979 and 32071 1980. In the photographic material of the present invention, benzophenone type or benzotriazole type compounds may be used as the ultraviolet absorbing agent. Those benzotriazole type compounds are described in Japanese Patent Examined Publication Nos.10466 1961, 26187 1967, 5496 1973, 41,72 1973, U.S. Patent Nos.3,754,919, 4,220,711, and the like. These cyan dye forming couplers, magenta dye forming couplers, yellow dye forming couplers and ultraviolet absorbing agents, which all are hydrophobic photographic additives, may be dispersed into an aqueous hydrophilic binder solution by a conventionally known method, and the dispersed liquid is then incorporated into silver halide emulsion layers or nonlight sensitive layers. As the method for dispersing these hydrophobic compounds any of those latex dispersing methods or oil in water type dispersing methods as described in Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication Nos.74538 1974, 59943 1976 and Research Disclosure No.14850 Aug. 1976 , pp.77 79, may be used. As the oil in water type dispersing method those conventionally known methods for dispersing hydrophobic compounds such as couplers may be applied. To be concrete, such a hydrophobic compound is dissolved into a mixture of a high boiling organic solvent whose boiling point is not less than 175 C and a low boiling solvent such as ethyl acetate and butyl acetate,, which is added at need thereto, and the solution is then mixed into an aqueous solution containing a surface active agent and hydrophilic binder such as gelatin, and emulsifiedly dispersed by dispersing means such as a high speed rotary mixer, colloid mill or ultrasonic disperser, and then the dispersed liquid is incorporated into emulsion layers or hydrophobic colloid layers as subsidiary layers. As for the binder of the component layers of the light sensitive material of this invention, gelatin such as an alkali treated gelatin or acid treated gelatin is most generally used, and also such gelatin may be used in part along with a derivative gelatin such as phthalated gelatin and phenylcarbamoyl gelatin, or albumin, agar agar, gum arabic, alginic acid, partly hydrolized cellulose derivative, partially hydrolized polyvinyl acetate, polyacrylamide or polyvinyl alcohol, or copolymer of these vinyl compounds. The emulsion and subsidiary layers of the photographic material of this invention may contain various photographic additives. For example, those antifoggants, dye image discoloration preventing agents, anti color stain agents, brightening agents, antistatic agents, surface active agents, ultraviolet absorbing agents as described in Research Disclosure No.17643 may be arbitrarily used. The photographic material of this invention is prepared by coating component layers such as emulsion and subsidiary layers containing at need various photographic additives mentioned above through a subbing layer or interlayer on a support or directly on a corona discharge treated, flame treated or ultraviolet ray treated support. Those advantageously usable as the support include, e.g., baryta paper, polyethylene laminated paper, polypropylene synthetic paper, reflective layer or reflective material combinedly used transparent support materials such as glass plates, polyester films including cellulose acetate film, cellulose nitrate film, polyethylene terephthalate film, polyamide film, polycarbonate film and polystyrene film. The coating of emulsion layers and other component layers of the photographic material of in this invention may be carried out by any of various coating methods including the dipping coating method, air doctor coating method, curtain coating method or hopper coating method. Further, those methods for simultaneously coating two or more layers as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,761,791 and 2,941,898 may also be used. In the photographic material of the present invention, the coating position of each emulsion layer may be optionally choosen. For example, the emulsion layers may be coated in the order of a blue sensitive emulsion layer, green sensitive emulsion layer and red sensitive emulsion layer from the support side, or alternatively in the order of a red sensitive emulsion layer, green sensitive emulsion layer and blue sensitive emulsion layer from the support side. To be more concrete, in the case of a color photographic paper, seven layers composed of a blue sensitive emulsion layer, first interlayer, green sensitive emulsion layer, second interlayer, red sensitive emulsion layer, third interlayer, and protective layer are preferred to be coated in the described order from the support side. The above second interlayer and or third interlayer are desirable to contain an ultraviolet absorbing agent. These component layers may contain the foregoing hydrophilic colloid as the binder material for emulsion use, and may also contain the foregoing various photographic additives to be incorporated in the emulsion layers. In case the photographic material of the present invention serves for making prints, the said material is exposed through a negative film having an image composed of dyes as the coupling reaction products, and then color developed. The color development is carried out by an ordinary color developing method. That is, the exposed photographic material is first processed in a color developer solution containing a color developing agent. Alternatively, where the photographic material contains a color developing agent or the precursor thereof, the said material is processed in an activator solution. And the color development is then followed by bleach and fixation processes in usual manner. In this instance, there are cases where the color developing process by the color developer or activator solution, the bleach process and the fixation process are performed independently, but, instead, these different processes can also be carried out at a time by a single processing liquid monobath having the functions of these processes for example, a color developer solution or activator solution containing a bleaching agent and fixing agent together that will be described hereinafter a bleach fix bath containing bleaching agent and fixing agent for use in the bleaching and fixing following the color developing process and the like. The photographic material may be processed in a bleach fix bath or the like to be desilvered immediately after being processed in a color developer solution or activator solution, but may, after the color development, be processed in an acid stop bath before the bleaching and fixing processes. In such an acid stop bath an aqueous acetic acid or citric acid solution may be used. Also, such processes as prehardening, neutralizing, washing, stabilizing processes and the like may, if necessary, be provided. The color photographic material for making prints, by being processed in such color developing processes, has a dye image formed by the coupling reaction. In addition, those typically usable as the color developing agent for developing the photographic material of this invention are aromatic primary amine color developing agents, which include aminophenol type and p phenylenediamine type derivatives. These compounds may be used in a free state or in the form of a salt thereof such as the hydrochloride, sulfate, p toluene sulfonate, tetraphenyl borate or p t octyl benzenesulfonate thereof. Typical examples of such aromatic primary amine color developing agents include N,N diethyl p phenylenediamine hydrochloride, N methyl p phenylenediamine hydrochloride, N,N dimethyl p phenylenediamine hydrochloride, N ethyl N β methanesulfonaminoethyl 3 methyl 4 aminoaniline and the sulfate thereof, N ethyl N β hydroxyethylaminoaniline, N,N diethyl 3 β methanesulfonamidoethyl 4 aminoaniline hydrochloride, 4 amino N 2 methoxyethyl N ethyl 3 methylaniline p toluene sulfonate, N ethyl N β methanesulfonamidoethyl 3 methyl 4 aminoaniline tetraphenylborate, 4 amino N 2 methoxyethyl N ethyl 3 methylaniline tetraphenylborate, p morpholinoaniline, p piperidinoaniline and 4 amino N,N diethyl 3 chloroaniline. Further, if necessary, the photographic material of this invention may contain a color developing agent precursor. The color developing agent precursor is a compound that is capable of producing a color developing agent under an alkaline condition, and includes aromatic aldehyde derivative Schiff s base type precursor, polyvalent metallic ion complex precursor, phthalic acid imide derivative precursor, phosphoric acid amide derivatic precursor, sugar amine reaction product precursor and urethane type precursor. These aromatic primary amine type color developing agent precursors are described in, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos.3,342,599, 2,507,114, 2,695,234 and 3,719,492, British Patent No.803,783, Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication Nos.135628 1978 and 79035 1979, Research Disclosure Nos.15159, 12146 and 13924. Any of these aromatic primary amine type color developing agents is contained in a quantity of normally from about 1 to about 20g liter in a color developer solution. If this is to be contained in the form of a precursor in the light sensitive material, it is used in a quantity of from about 0.5 to about 3 moles per mole of silver halide. The color developer or activator solution to be used for developing the photographic material of this invention contains an alkaline agent such as potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium tertiary phosphate or potassium tertiary phosphate a sulfide such as sodium sulfide or potassium sulfide and a bromide such as sodium bromide, potassium bromide or ammonium bromide. Further, if necessary, the solution may also contain a prior art development restrainer a chloride such as ammonium chloride, potassium chloride or sodium chloride an organic solvent such as ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, methanol, ethanol, n butanol, benzyl alcohol, acetone or dimethylformamide an amine such as hydroxylamine, ethanolamine, ethylenediamine or diethanolamine, and a water softener such as sodium hexametaphosphate, sodium tripolyphosphate, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid or ethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid. The color developer or activator solution to be for treating a photographic material of this invention may contain a subsidiary developing agent, which is preferably a 1 aryl 3 pyrazolidone derivative and used in the quantity range of from 1 mg to 1 gram, and preferably from 10 mg to 500 mg per liter of the color developer or activator solution. Those typically usable as the subsidiary developing agent include 1 phenyl 3 pyrazolidone, 4 methyl 1 phenyl 3 pyrazolidone, 4,4 dimethyl 1 phenyl 3 pyrazolidone, 4 methyl 4 hydroxymethyl 1 phenyl 3 pyrazolidone or 4 methyl 4 hydroxymethyl 1 p tolyl 3 pyrazolidone. The color developer or activator solution to be used for treating a photographic material of this invention is always maintained alkaline in usual manner, and the hydrogen ion concentration thereof, although arbitrarily selectable according to the type, composition, purpose and use of a negative light sensitive material and color photographic light sensitive material for making prints therefrom is generally from pH9.5 to pH13.5. The color developer or activator solution is used generally in a certain temperature range, which, although selectable according to the type, composition, use and purpose of the photographic material of this invention, is preferably from 15 C to 70 C, and more preferably from 30 C to 50 C. As for the bleaching agent to be used in a bleaching bath or bleach fix bath, prior art compounds may be used which include, e.g., aminopolycarboxylic acid ferric complex salts such as ferric sodium ethylenediamine tetraacetate or ferric ammonium ethylenediamine tetraacetate,, and persulfates such as ammonium persulfate or sodium persulfate. For the fixing bath or bleach fix bath those prior art compounds may be used as the fixing agent, which include thiosulfates such as sodium thiosulfate, ammonium thiosulfate water soluble sulfur containing diols such as 3,6 dithia 1,8 octanediol, 3,6,9,12 tetrathia 1,14 tetradecanediol water soluble sulfur containing dibasic acids such as ethylene bis thioglycolic acid and sodium ethylene bis thioglycolate. The present invention, when applied particularly to a color photographic light sensitive material for print making use, can provide a photographic material which is excellent in the physical characteristics of the layers thereof i.e., excellent in the characteristics such as the glossiness, scratch resistance or degree of swelling, and whose sensitivity very little changes with time after the manufacture thereof, thus enabling to largely improve the work efficiency in the photo finishing process. The present invention will be illustrated further in detail by the following examples. The invention, however, is not limited to and by the examples. A chemically ripened silver chlorobromide emulsion containing 80 mole silver bromide , to which is added a 2.0x10 ⁵ mole per mole of silver halide of the foregoing exemplified compound D 22 as a sensitizing dye, is prepared. On the other hand, the foregoing exemplified Coupler C 28 is dissolved into a mixture of dioctyl phthalate with ethyl acetate the solution is then added to an aqueous gelatin solution containing Alkanol XC sodium alkylnaphthalenesulfonate, a product of DuPont and the mixture is then dispersed by a homogenizer to thereby prepare a coupler dispersed liquid. Subsequently, this coupler dispersed liquid is added to the above chemically ripened silver halide emulsion so that the former is contained in a quantity of 0.4 mole per mole of silver halide, and further to this is added a 8x10 ³ mole per mole of silver halide of each of the foregoing invention s compounds X 26, X 30 and X 37 separately to make different samples in combination as shown in Table 1, and further to these were added the foregoing exemplified hardener compounds II 1, II 2 and III 1 and the following comparative hardener H 1 as shown in Table 1, and then dried, whereby monochromatic photographic element samples No.1 through No.8 are prepared. The processing conditions used herein are as follows, and applied in the same way to all the samples. The thus prepared samples No.1 through No.8 each was examined with respect to the glossiness, scratch resistance and raw stock preservability change in the sensitivity with time after the preparation of each sample in the following procedure. The results are as shown in Table 1. A white sample obtained by processing each of the unexposed samples by the above procedure was measured with respect to the glossiness by use of a glossmeter manufactured by Tokyo Denshiki K.K. , and also measured with respect to the glossiness of the layer when deteriorated by being exposed over a period of 300 hours to the xenon light of a xenon fadeometer. At a point of time nearing the completion of the color development of each sample, i.e., after immersing the sample for three minutes in the foregoing color developer solution, the sample was measured with respect to the scratch resistance by use of a scrachmeter manufactured by Hayden . Each sample was allowed to stand for a period of one month in an atmospheric condition of 25 C 60 relative humidity, and then the change in the sensitivity, i.e., the difference between the sensitivity values before and after the raw stock storage, was determined on the basis of the following formula. The sensitivity was found by measuring the densities of each sample piece that was exposed through an optical wedge and then processed by the foregoing developing procedure. As is apparent from Table 1, samples No.2 through No.8, which represent photographic materials of this invention, are excellent in the glossiness as well as in the scratch resistance as compared to comparative sample No.1. Further, as for the change in the sensitivity with the lapse of time, samples No.4 through No.8 of this invention containing the compounds of Formula I are largely improved as compared to sample No.3, containing none of such compounds. Samples were prepared in the same manner as in Example 1 except that a protective layer gelatin coated amount 1.5g m² was provided as the topmost layer and the hardeners II 1, II 2 and III 1 and the comparative hardener H 1 and the invention compounds X 26, X 30 and X 37 in the same quantities as used in Example 1 were added not to the emulsion layer but to the protective layer coating liquid. The obtained samples were tested in the same manner as in Example 1. The results were similar to those of Example 1. Separate chemically ripened silver chlorobromide emulsions containing the foregoing exemplified sensitizing dye compounds D 3 and D 32 and the following sensitizing dyes A and B, respectively, each in a quantity of 5x10 ⁵ mole per mole of silver halide, are prepared. On the other hand, a coupler dispersed liquid containing the foregoing exemplified coupler C 35 is prepared in the same manner as in Example 1, and the liquid is added separately to the above respective chemically ripened silver halide emulsions so that the coupler content is 0.4 mole per mole of silver halide, and then the coupler containing emulsions each is coated on a polyethylene coated paper. Further, on the layer of each of these coated samples is coated a protective layer comprising the invention s hardener II 1 added in a quantity of 0.01g per gram of gelatin total gelatin of both emulsion layer and protective layer and the invention s compound X 26, in combination as shown in Table 1, added in a quantity of 8x10 ³ mole per mole of silver halide, and then dried, whereby monochromatic photographic element samples No.9 through No.16 are prepared. These samples each was tested with respect to the raw stock preservability in the same manner as in Example 1. The test results are as given in Table 2. As is apparent from Table 2, any of the photographic material samples Nos.10, 12, 14 and 16 of this invention shows that the degree of the change in the sensitivity thereof during the raw stock storage is less than one second of that of any of the comparative samples, and further this effect is particularly conspicuous in the samples No.14 and No.16, which contain the particularly preferred sensitizing dyes earlier mentioned in this specification. On a polyethylene coated paper support are coated the component layers in the order given in Table 3 from the support side in combination with the invention s hardeners, comparative hardeners, invention s compounds, sensitizing dyes and cyan couplers as given in Table 4, whereby multicolor photographic element samples No.19 through No.35 are prepared. The obtained samples were subjected to various tests in the following procedures. In addition, the yellow coupler Y 1, magenta coupler M 1, ultraviolet absorbing agents UV 1 and UV 2, antidiscoloration agents AO 1 and AO 2, sensitizing dye H 1, antistain agent AS 1 and comparative hardener H 2, which all are used in this example, are as follows 1,3,5 triacryloyl hexahydro S triazine Tested in the same manner under the same condition as in Example 1. Tested in the same manner under the same condition as in Example 1. Tested in the same manner under the same condition as in Example 1. Each sample was allowed to stand for two days and five days in an incubation chamber constantly air conditioned at 35 C 50 RH, and after that the degree of swelling thereof was measured and determined by the following formula The results are as shown in Table 4. As is apparent from Table 4, the samples No.19 and No.24, containing comparative hardener H 1, are inferior in the glossiness and scratch resistance, and the samples No.20 and No.25, containing comparative hardener H 2, although better in the glossiness and scratch resistance than the samples containing comparative hardener H 1, take time until the degree of swelling thereof becomes settled and are poor in the progress of hardening, whereas the samples Nos.21 through 23 and 26 through 35, of this invention, are excellent in all the layer s physical characteristics including the glossiness, scratch resistance and degree of swelling. Further, regarding the sensitivity change with the lapse of time the samples Nos.26 through 35 of this invention which contain the compounds of Formula I as hardeners, are largely improved as compared to the samples Nos. 21 through 23, which contain none of such compounds, and particularly the samples Nos. 26 through 34 are conspicuously excellent in this respect.
