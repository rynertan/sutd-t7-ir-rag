# Passive Q switched power laser resonator.

## Abstract
Optical resonator for power lasers, consisting of an active means 3 , two totally reflecting cavity mirrors 1,6 , a phase shifter 2 , a polarizer 4 and a passive Q switch 5 . The passive Q switch is placed between the polarizer 4 and one of the two cavity mirrors, while the active means 3 and the phase shifter 2 are set between the polarizer 4 and the other cavity mirror. The configuration is meant to reduce the losses introduced by the passive Q switch, and also to reduce the risk of it being damaged by radiation.
