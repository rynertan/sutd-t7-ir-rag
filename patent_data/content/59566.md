## Description
TWO WAY COVER ASSEMBLY The present invention relates to a cover assembly for enclosing a rear portion of an electrical connector and providing a cable exit therefrom and in particular to an assembly which can provide alternate directions for a cable exiting from an electrical connector. In the past it has been usual practice to provide a cable cover for an electrical connector which cover has a fixed exit for the cable. Thus, it is not always possible to direct the cable away from the connector in the manner desired. Some covers do have means for varying the angle of cable exiting but these usually require a rather complex assembly of parts and do not always accomplish the desired angling effect. Examples of known cable directing covers may be found in the following U.S. Patents 3,904,265 3,995,947 4,108,527 and 4,169,648. The present invention relates to a cover assembly for an electrical connector which assembly allows directing an exiting cable either 900 or 1800 from the connector. The subject cover assembly includes a yoke adapted to engage, from the rear, the mounting flange of the connector and a pair of mating cover members which are selectively secured together engaging both the yoke and the cable to provide the 900 or 1800 cable exiting as desired. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a cover assembly which can be readily mounted on an electrical connector without the use of any hardware. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a cover assembly which will direct an exiting cable 900 or 1800 from an electrical connector of known configuration. It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a two way cable cover assembly for an electrical connector which cover assembly can be readily and economically manufactured. Embodiments of the subject invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which FIGURE 1 is an exploded perspective view of a first embodiment of the subject cover assembly and a known electrical connector FIGURE 2 is a perspective view of the first embodiment of the subject cover assembly engaging the known connector to provide a 900 cable exiting FIGURE 3 is a plan view of the first embodiment of the subject cover assembled to provide 1800 exiting of the cable from the connector and FIGURE 4 is an exploded perspective view of an alternate embo iment of a yoke member for the subject cover assembly. The subject cover assembly has been shown in combination with a known elongated electrical connector 10 of the type disclosed in U.S. PatentNo. 3,002,176 terminating a cable 12 in conventional manner. The connector 10 has a peripherial mounting flange 14. The subject cover assembly includes a mounting yoke 16, a first cover member 18, a second cover member 20, and a cable clamping member 22. The first embodiment of the yoke 16 is formed with a pair of spaced sidewalls 24, 26 joined by an intermediate wall 28 extending substantially normal to the planes of the sidewalls. The opposed faces of the sidewalls define first and second parallel, spaced, mounting flange receiving grooves 30, 32, respectively.Each sidewall also has, on the opposite, outwardly directed surface, an elongated mounting lug 34. The first and second cover members 18, 20 have latching means 36, 38 for detachably securing the cover members together in known fashion.They further each have an elongated groove 40 each of which receives a respective and similarly elongated lug 34 of the yoke 16. Each cover member also includes a cable exit 42, 44 at least one of which can be profiled to receive therein a cable sizing and gripping member 22. The subject cover assembly is mounted on a known electrical connector by first sliding the yoke 16 over the connector 10 so that edge portions of the peripherial flange 14 of the connector lie iin the respective grooves 30, 32. The wall 28 will form an abutment limiting the insertion of the connector 10 into the yoke 16 to properly position the yoke 16 with respect to the connector 10. The covers 18 and 20 are then provided with the proper sizing element 22, if used, and snapped together in either of the two configurations as shown in Figures 2 and 3 to provide the desired cable exiting. If cover 18 is on the top, as shown in Figure 1, the result will be 900 cable exiting as shown in Figure 2. If cover 20 is placed on top, using the Figure 1 orientation of the yoke 16, then the result will be 1800 cable exiting as shown in Figure 3. An alternate embodiment of the yoke 46 is shown in Figure 4. This embodiment has a pair of spaced sidewalls 48, 50 joined by an intermediate wall 52, extending normal to the planes of the sidewalls, and a peripherial flange 54 extending from aligned edges of the sidewalls. The sidewalls are also provided with outwardly directed elongated mounting lugs 56. The flange 54 includes mounting apertures 58, 60 aligned with like mounting apertures in the connector. The operation of this embodiment of the yoke 46 is similar to yoke 16.This yoke 46 would be assembled with the connector 10 by bringing the flanges 14, 54 into abutment and securing them together by known means not shown . The covers 18, 20 would then be applied as before.
