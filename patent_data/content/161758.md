# 50 point of amplitude and phase detector.

## Abstract
A 50 point of amplitude and phase detector. A differential amplifier produces non inverted and inverted signals representa tive of a periodic input signal. Respective sample and hold circuits sample the levels of the non inverted and inverted signals at predetermined points and the difference is input to the differential amplifier to equalize the position of those signals. The crossover of the non inverted and inverted signals is detected by a gated differential amplifier whose output controls an oscillator from which the gating signal is derived to lock the phase of the oscillator output with the phase of the periodic signal.
