## Description
A Device for Yawing Moment Control for Aircraft The present invention relates to a device for yaw moment control for an aircraft having a slender nose, at high angles of attack and especially at speeds up toMach 0.5. The nose may be pointed or rounded. In aircraft such as airplanes and guided missiles, especially those for supersonic speed, with a nose characterized by a high slenderness ratio, that is, lengthl width over 1.5, there normally arise large uncontrolled yawing moments, even with symmetrical relative wind, at high angles of attack d, that is, the angle between the longitudinal axis of asymmetry of the aircraft and the existing wind vector, in the region of 20 800, most notably 350 700, at speeds up.to Mach 0.5. The reason is that there are formed asymmetrical, stochastically arising nose body vortices, which cause an asymmetric pressure on the nose body that gives rise to a yawing moment.Since the ordinary steering means of an aircraft has a markedly reduced effect in the angle of attack region just mentioned, the condition involves a serious disadvantage. Various means are known for eliminating this disadvantage. Thus it has been proposed that the aircraft s nose be provided with symmetrically arranged guide plates, so called strakes, with the function of distributing the arising body nose air vortices symmetrically so that the yaw moment is eliminated. Such guide plates cause a significant increase in drag, even at moderate angles of attack at high speeds.Another known means for avoiding the above mentioned disadvantage comprises apparatus for blowing pressure air or powder gas in a direction transverse to the plane of symmetry of the aircraft, whereby the yawing moment is opposed.Such arrangements are heavy and bulky. A related complication is that possible installation of radar apparatus in the front part of the aircraft would interfere with such a device in the nose part. The object of this invention is to provide a simple, reliable device for yaw moment control in aircraft with slender nose portions at high angles of attack and especially at speeds up to Mach 0.5. The device is such that it does not cause increased drag at high speeds. Such a device is characterized according to the invention in that ports are arranged in both sides of the nose portion of the aircraft, separated from the plane of symmetry of the aircraft, which ports are mutually so connected that a pressure difference between the two sides caused by one of the mentioned asymmetrical nose body vortices is equalized The device can be embodied in various ways. It is suitable to arrange the ports, seen at right angles to the longitudinal axis of symmetry, in the plane of symmetry, pairwise with their centers of gravity essentially on a line at right angles to the axis of symmetry. It is also suitable to arrange the ports, seen in the direction at right angles to the plane of symmetry, pairwise with their centers of gravity at like distances from the longitudinal axis of symmetry, preferably near it or somewhat below it.In a suitable embodiment the centers of gravity of the ports are at a distance from the tip of the nose that corresponds substantially to the distance between ports. The ports should be located in the forward part of the nose portion, the centers of gravity within a distance from the tip of the nose portion equal to 0.02 0.2 times the length of the nose portion, suitably about .05 times the same. The ports can have different forms, but are suitably circular with a diameter on the order of .01 times the length of the nose portion. The ports can also have the form of elongated slits, suitably with longitudinal axes substantially parallel with the longitudinal axis of symmetry of the aircraft. Since one seeks the smallest possible drag at high speeds, the ports ought to be provided with controllable closures which dover the ports in normal flight at high speeds. The closures are so arranged that they can be removed when necessary, suitably inwardly so that they do not create extra air resistance. In a special embodiment the closures can take the form of safety devices arranged to be removed from the aircraft with pressure gas, for example from an initiatable powder charge. In that case the device must then be restored after operating in flight.The invention is more particularly explained with reference to the accompanying drawings, the nature of which appears from the following Fig. la is a perspective sketch of the nose part of an aircraft with symmetrical flow relationship Fig. lb is a cross section through the subject matter of Fig. la, seen from in front Fig. 2a is a view like Fig. la but with asymmetrical flow conditions Fig. 2b is a view like Fig. lb, but through the subject matter of Fig. 2a Fig. 3 shows the relationship between the yawing moment coefficient Cn and the angle of attack 4 Fig. 4 shows the relationship between the yawing moment coefficient Cn at d 500 and the oblique relative wind angle 3 Fig. 5 is a longitudinal section of a device according to the invention, seen from above Figs. 6 and 7 are side views of devices according to the invention Fig. 8 shows a nose portion of an aircraft provided with a device according to the invention, seen from the side Figs. 9 and 10 show alternative devices according to the invention, seen from the side Fig. 11 shows a device according to the invention with controllable closures, in longitudinal section, seen from above Fig. 12 is a longitudinal section, seen from above, of a device according to the invention, but with closures arranged to be removed with gas pressure. In Figs. la and lb are shown flow conditions at an airplane nose at moderate angles of attack and an oblique relative wind angle, that is to say the angle between the plane of symmetry of the airplane s nose and the wind vector, O. An airplane s nose is designated by 1, its plane of symmetry by 2, the prevailing wind vector by 3.Symmetrical flow conditions prevail so that from the sides 4, 5 of the airplane s nose, spaced from the plane of symmetry, departing body air vortices 4, 5 are symmetrical, which means that the pressure conditions caused by them do not produce any yaw moment. If the angle of attack C increases, there gradually arise around the nose of the airplane the asymmetrical flow conditions that are depicted in Fig. 2a and 2b. Since the body air vortices 4, 5 are released asymmetrically from the airplane s nose, there arise through the asymmetrically distributed pressures on the sides 4, 5 a side force 6 which gives rise to a yaw moment. In Fig. 3 is shown the relationship between Cn and Gr, that is, the yaw moment coefficient Cn at 3 0 and angle of attack. The yaw moment coefficient Cn is a dimensionless number and is defined as yaw moment dynamic pressure x wing area x wing span. The depicted curves a, b and c were measured in a wind tunnel on a slender airplane model and are typical for the speed range up to Mach 0.5. In the measurements the flow conditions at the airplane s nose arose stochastically, which means that it is not possible to predict whether left side symmetry, curve a, right side symmetry, curve b, or alternating left and right symmetry, curve c, will arise with increasing Ct. From the diagram it appears that the asymmetrical flow conditions begin to arise at about 250 and gives rise to a significant yaw moment between 350 and 700. If the airplane s nose is pro vided with a device according to the invention, the yaw moment caused by the asymmetrical flow condition is eliminated, since the pressure difference between the sides of the airplane s nose, which is the direct cause of the yaw moment, is equalized.This is illustrated in Fig. 3, curve d, which shows a measurement of the same type as relates to curves a c but with the nose of the airplane provided with a device according to the invention. As can be seen, the yaw moment is, as a practical matter, wholly eliminated. The device according to the invention thus solves the problem of uncontrolled yaw moments at high angles of at tack with a symmetrical relative wind, that is ss O. It has shown itself, however, to have a further valuable function. This relates, in particular, to the self stabilizing of an aircraft with a certain oblique relative wind, that is, ordinary values of g. In Fig. 4, Cn at 500 is shown as a function of 3. The curves were measured in a wind tunnel by the same method as is seen in Fig. 3.Curve a shows an uncontrolled yawing moment that arises on an airplane s nose without any device according to the invention. Curve b on the other hand shows the yawing moment that is typical for an airplane s nose provided with a device according to the invention. In the diagram tCn signi fies the yawing moment coefficient for a restoring yaw moment and Cn for a non restoring yaw moment. With increasing , up to about 50, Cn increases, which means that the airplane is self stabilized without use of an active control device such as a rudder. Within the region O 5 120 there arises a certain restoring yaw moment, which means that the airplane is trimmable with an active control device.Curve c depicts Cn as a function of at an airplane s nose provided with symmetrically placed lengthwise extending guide plates, so called strakes. As is apparent from the curve, such guide plates have no stabilizing function whatsoever with an oblique relative wind, but instead they produce instability which is of course a disadvantage, in addition to their already mentioned characteristic of producing a significant drag at high speeds even at ordinary angles of attack. In Figs. 6 12 are shown some embodiments of a device according to the invention. In Figs. 6 and 7 is shown a device with a port 7 arranged in the side 4 of the nose portion 1 and a port 8 in the side 5. The ports 7, 8 are provided with a passage 9 which in the illustrated embodiment is arranged at right angles to the longitudinal axis of symmetry of the nose portion. The ports 7, 8 are located with their centers of gravity somewhat below the mentioned longitudinal symmetry axis. The passage 9 is located at approximately a distance from the tip 1 of the nose portion that corresponds to the length of the passage 9 between the ports 7, 8.In Fig. 7 is shown a device according to the invention, having ports, of which only the one 11 is seen, that are located at the half height, that is, they have their centers of gravity in a plane through the longitudinal axis of symmetry at right angles to the plane of symmetry. In Fig. 8 is shown a suitable device according to the invention, with ports, of which only one 12 is visible, placed at a distance from the tip 10 of the nose portion 1 equal to 1 20 of the length of the nose portion 1. An embodiment with three ports 13, 14, 15 at one side and corresponding symmetrically placed ports is shown in Fig. 9, and Fig. 10 shows a port 16 in the form of an oval slit, extending in the direction of the longitudinal symmetry axis. An embodiment with ports 17, 18 provided with controllable closures 19, 20 is shown in Fig. 11. A linear motor 21 is arranged to draw the closures 19, 20 inward, when necessary, in the direction of arrows 22, 23, so that a connection is provided between the ports 17, 18 through a passage 24. When the need for yaw moment control no longer exists, the ports 17, 18 can be closed by reason of the linear motor 21 being caused to move the closures 19, 20 back to the closed position, oppositely to the direction of the arrows 22, 23, whereby the drag increasing effect of the ports 17, 18, especially at high speeds, is eliminated. An embodiment that has the character of safety equipment is shown in Fig. 12. Ports 25, 26 are here closed by closures 27, 28 in the ends of a passage 29 that connects ports 25, 26. The passage 29 is also connected with a pressure source 30 in which is located, for example, an initiatable powder charge. When need arises, it is caused to explode, and the pressure thus formed drives out the closures 27, 28 in the direction of the arrows 31, 32, so that a pressure equalizing connection is thus created between the two sides of the nose portion, so that a possible uncontrolled yaw moment is eliminated.
