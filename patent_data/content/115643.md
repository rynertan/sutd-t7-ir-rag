# Accessory carrying type starting motor.

## Abstract
An accessory carrying type starting motor comprises an electromagnetic switching device 4 for opening and closing a contact 15, 16 to control actuation of a d.c. motor 301 , a pinion 7 placed to be slidable by a transferring device 5 fitted to one end of the rotary shaft 601 of the armature 32, 33 of the d.c. motor 301 , through a shift lever 9 connected to a plunger 12 of the electromagnetic switching device 4 , a ring gear 19 transmitting a rotation al force for starting to a crank shaft of an internal combus tion engine when the ring gear 19 comes to interlock with the pinion 7 , an accessory device 8 consisting of a pump and other elements provided at the other end of the rota shaft 601 of the armature 32, 33 of the d.c. motor 301 , and a rotational force connecting and disconnecting device 30 which is interposed between the accessory device 8 and the armature 32, 33 and wnich is brought into a releas ing state when the pinion 7 is interlocked with the ring gear 19 by means of the electromagnetic switching device 4 and is brought into a coupling state when the pinion 7 is in a non interlocking state.
