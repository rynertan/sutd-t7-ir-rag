## Description
The present invention concerns thermoplastic resins and coatings prepared therefrom. Thermoplastic non thermoset epoxy resins have been employed in the formulation of highway, pavement, marking paints as disclosed by J. M. Dale in FR A 2,531,091 refers to a four component system including 1 a dihydrid phenol, 2 a two functional epoxy resin, 3 a monofunctional epoxy or phenolic compound, and 4 a branching agent that is greater than two functional epoxy resin material such as a triglycidyl p aminphenol. On the contrary the resin of the present invention requires three reactants and not four as disclosed in the cited reference. The present composition does not contain a branching agent, moreover the composition cannot contain a branching agent having nitrogen which can lead to a colour problem in the final product because of oxydation at high temperatures. Also, the four component system taught by the cited reference does not teach a thermally stable product and which does not have a viscosity increase at 232 C. The table in the present specification clearly shows that the viscosity stability of the resin composition according to the present invention is greater than for other prior art products. The four component system of the cited reference has a viscosity stability problem at the temperature specified before. The viscosity of the products disclosed in the cited reference is measured at room temperature. That means that this is a liquid product. On the contrary, the present invention refers to a product which is solid at room temperature. GB A 2,007,672 teaches that 50 percent to 100 percent of the secondary hydroxyl groups along the back bone of the epoxy resin are reacted with a monofunctional isocyanate see claim 1, line 22 . The resulting resin from the disclosed structure illustrates that a large amount of epoxy groups remain in the structure as taught in Table 1. The resin of said reference has a viscosity of no greater than 20 Pas at 25 C. On the contrary the resin according to the present invention does not have residual epoxy resin groups. The epoxy resin groups are kept with the monofunctional isocyanate, whereas the cited reference does not keep the epoxy groups shown in the chemical structure disclosed in said reference. Furthermore, the known resin is liquid, whereas the present invention provides a resin composition which is solid at room temperature. The present invention provides a thermoplastic resin which exhibits a much reduced viscosity increase at elevated temperatures, i.e. more stable. The present invention pertains to a thermally stable, thermoplastic resin prepared by reacting in the presence of an effective quantity of a suitable catalyst wherein components A , B and C are reacted in quantities which provide an equivalent ratio of component B to component A of from 03 1 to 0.95 1 and an equivalent ratio of component C to component A of from 0.87 1 to 1.1 1 and wherein the equivalent ratio of components B C to component A is from 1.17 1 to 1.96 1.
