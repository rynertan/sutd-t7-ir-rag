## Description
PROCESS FOR PREPARING 3.4 AMIN0 NITR0 DIPHENYLETHER The present invention relates to a process for preparing 3,4 amino nitro diphenylether, in particular according to a catalytic method in a heterogeneous phase. More particularly, the present invention relates to a process for preparing 3,4 amino nitro diphenylether by means of a method based on so called phase transfer catalysis, preferably by using quaternary organic salts and or crown ethers better defined hereinafter. The resulting compound is an interesting intermediate product, particularly useful in the synthesis of fibres, especially aramidic fibres of the Kelvar type. Kelvar is a Registered Trade Mark. The method of carrying out catalyzed reactions according to the phase transfer technique has been broadly developed and is well known. As far as is known, however, it seems that there is limited knowledge in the field of application of this technique to the aromatic series, and in particular to the synthesis of 3,4 amino nitro diphenylether. According to a known technique British patent No.1,216,109 , 3.4 amino nitro diphenylether can be obtained only by condensation between para chloro nitrobenzene and meta amino phenol in the presence of basic agents, by using expensive and not easily recoverable solvents, such as dimethylsulphoxide. On the other hand, the relatively high cost of the starting meta amino phenol makes it advisable to acquire a technique leading to particularly high yields and selectivities of such compound. Thus, it is an aim of the present invention to provide a method of preparing 3,4 amino nitro diphenylether according to the phase transfer catalysis technique, which would be applicable on an industrial scale. The present invention provides a process for preparing 3,4 amino nitro diphenylether by reacting p chloro nitrobenzene with an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salt of m amino phenol or a precursor thereof, characterized in that the reaction is conducted in a diphase system consisting of an organic phase comprising the p chloro nitrobenzene and an aqueous phase containing the alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salt of m amino phenol, in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst. Thus there is provided a process for preparing 3,4 amino nitro diphenylether, by reaction in a phase transfer system, in which para chloro nitrobenzene is reacted with meta amino phenol in the form of an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salt, preferably sodium or potassium, preferably at a temperature approximately ranging from 500 to 120 C. more preferably from 900 to 1100C, and preferably substantially at atmospheric pressure, characterized in that the reaction is conducted in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst, and more particularly in the presence of an onium salt, preferably a quaternary alkylammonium salt of formula QR4Y, where 9 is an atom of N, P, As, Sb, etc., R is an alkyl radial containing up to 20 carbon atoms and Y is a halogen selected from chlorine, bromine and iodine, or a crown ether, in a diphase system consisting of a a first organic phase composed of para chloro nitrobenzene, optionally dissolved in an organic solvent selected from aromatic and or aliphatic hydrocarbons and chloroderivatives thereof, the second phase b being composed of meta amino phenol in the form of an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salt as defined hereinabove, in an aqueous solution substantially immiscible with the first phase. The reaction can be schematically expressed by the following equation EMI3.1 Na, K, etc. ..... . The alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salt of meta amino phenol can be substituted by a pre cursor thereof the meta amino phenol itself and the alkali metal oxide or hydrate in a substantially stoichiometric amount with respect to each other, and preferably in defect in respect of para chloro nitrobenzene, and precisely in a molar ratio in respect of para chloro nitrobenzene ranging from 1 1 to 1 10, approximately. As mentioned hereinbefore, the para chloro nitrobenzene may be utilized either as such or in an organic solution. The solvent is selected from aromatic and or aliphatic hydrocarbons and chloroderivatives thereof, such as toluene or chlorobenzene. The reaction terminates in a time generally ranging from about 2 to about 50 hours, depending on the parameters employed, i.e. temperature, concentration, catalyst type. The molar ratio between the para chloro nitrobenzene and the alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salt of meta amino phenol is preferably substantially equimolar however, an excess of para chloro nitrobenzene up to a molar ratio of 10 1 is permissible, and a molar ratio ranging from 2 1 to 4 1 is preferable. The phase transfer catalyst suitably comprised by the onium salt, preferably alkylammonium salt NR4Y, or the crown ether, is preferably added according to a molar ratio with respect to the starting meta amino phenol in a range of from 0.01 to 0.2, approximately. The term onium salts means the so called salts of quaternary ammonium, phosphonium, etc. having, as is known to those skilled in the art, a catalytic activity for the purpose of the phase transfer reaction. Such salts can be comprised of the formula QR4Y, in which Q represents an atom of nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic or antimony respectively for the salts of ammonium, phosphonium, etc, and R and Y are as defined hereinabove. For practical reasons, the preferred salts are the quaternary ammonium salts previously defined. Particularly effective results may be obtained, according to the present invention, when using as onium quaternary salts those in which the alkyl radical contains at least 4 carbon atoms, in particular tetrabutylammonium bromide, tricaprylmethylammonium chloride, trilaurylmethylammonium chloride, and tetrabutyl phosphonium chloride and bromide. The crown ethers employed are cyclic polyethers which are known as complexing agents for alkali metals. Effective crown ethers have proved to be, for example, dicyclohexyl 18 crown 6 and dibenzo 18 crown 6. It is of course also possible to use, as phase transfer catalysts, other compounds, namely those which are usually utilized in said technique. The reaction is suitably conducted in a non oxidizing atmosphere, which can be obtained according to conventional methods with nitrogen, argon, etc. The process according to a preferred embodiment of the invention is carried out as follows. Into a reactor, under a nitrogen atmosphere, there are introduced the para chloro nitrobenzene, the organic solvent, if any, the quaternary onium salt or the crown ether, and the meta amino phenol, whereafter the temperature is brought to the desired value. Under stirring there is added an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hydrate or oxide in an aqueous solution, in a proper amount and time, while keeping the temperature at the predetermined value. The reaction is continued for the necessary time until completion. The resulting 3,4 amino nitro diphenylether is then separated according to conventional techniques, such as acid basic extraction, crystallization, etc. Due to the mild operative conditions and to the high selectivity of the desired product, the process is particularly advantageous. Further advantages consist in the easy availability and low costs of the raw materials and in the simplicity of the equipment employed, since the process is practically carried out in one step only. The process of the invention may be operated in reactivity conditions which are equal to or even superior to those obtainable with the conventional processes, in which the same reaction is conducted in dipolar aprotic solvents such as dimethylsulphoxide. In particular, the process exhibits the following advantages as compared with the known art 1 it is possible to obtain a high catalyticy on the onium salt or crown ether 2 it is possible to use aqueous solutions of the alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salt of meta amino phenol 3 it is possible not to use organic solvents, the dissolving function being carried out by the starting para chloro nitrobenzene. The invention will be further described with reference to the following illustrative Examples.Example 1 10.9 g 0.1 moles of meta amino phenol, 47.1 g 0.3 moles of para chloro nitrobenzene, and 3.8 cc 0.01 moles of Aliquat 336 R tricaprylmethylammonium chloride were introduced, under a nitrogen atmosphere, into a 250 cc flask equipped with a stirrer, a thermometer, a gas bubbler, a reagent charting system and a reflux cooler. The reaction mass was made molten by increasing the temperature to about 1000C and, under stirring, in 2 hours, 6.6 g 0.1 moles of KOH at 85 , dissolved in 60 cc of water, were added dropwise. While keeping the system under reflux, at an internal temperature of about 1050C, the reaction was continued for a further 11 hours. On conclusion of the reaction, the system was acidified with dilute sulphuric acid until an acid pH was obtained, and the unreacted para chloro nitrobenzene was distilled in a vapour stream thus, 30.6 g of para chloro nitrobenzene were recovered. The acid solution was hot treated with 1 g of activated carbon and with 2 g of diatomaceous earth. After filtration, the solution was made alkaline with aqueous soda 3,4 aminonitro diphenylether precipitated, whereafter it was filtered, washed and dried.
