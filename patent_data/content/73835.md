# PROCESS FOR PRODUCING POLYURETHANE POLYMER.

## Abstract
A process for producing polyurethane polymer by reacting an at least partly blocked isocyanate compound with an active hydrogen containing compound using catalytic amounts of a specific organotin compound and a specific amine compound. The resulting polymer significantly lowers a baking temperature and provides a baked film having a smooth surface and good physical properties.
