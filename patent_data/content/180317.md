# Apparatus for maintaining fluid pressure in an ocular globe at a predetermined level.

## Abstract
An ophthalmic device and apparatus for measuring and controlling relative pressure of fluid inside an ocular globe 12 includes a surgical instrument 60 respectively I which is adapted to penetrate the ocular globe 12 . A fluid pressure transducer 65 is mounted on the instrument 60 so that, when the instrument 60 penetrates the ocular globe 12 , the trans ducer 65 is located adjacent to an opening 66 that communi cates with the interior of the globe 12 so that it can react to pressure changes in the fluid therein and generate signals in response to pressure changes in the fluid. The signal is transmit ted externally of the instrument 60 to a pump 107 or other fluid transfer device which is operatively connected to the transducer 65 for first receiving signals and then supplying or removing fluid from the ocular globe 12 in response to the signals according to a predetermined set of instructions. The pump 107 is connected to a closed loop 110 in which fluid is continuously circulated. Fluctuations in intraocular pressure cause the pump 107 to speed up or slow down and then supply fluid to or remove fluid from the ocular globe 12 through a conduit 104 connected to the closed loop 110 .
