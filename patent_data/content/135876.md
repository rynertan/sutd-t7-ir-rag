# Geared motor.

## Abstract
A geared motor comprising an output shaft 14 rotatably received in a housing 11 a sun gear 17 securely supported on the output shaft 14 in the housing 11 and having a plural ity of external teeth 21 a ring gear 22 housed in the housing 11 and having a plurality of internal teeth 23 meshed with the external teeth 21 of the sun gear 17 , and the internal teeth 23 of the ring gear 22 having a pitch circle larger than that of the external teeth of the sun gear and being larger in number than the external teeth 21 of the sun gear 17 sup porting means 24 for supporting the ring gear 22 in such manner that the center axis of the ring gear 22 is eccentrically revolvable with respect to the axis of rotation of the output shaft 14 and the ring gear 22 is prevented from being ro tated about its center axis and drive means 28 for generating electromagnetic forces one group of which has a plurality of force directions radially inwardly directed and the other group of which has a plurality of force directions radially outwardly di rected, the different groups being circumferentially succes sively displaceable and driving the ring gear 22 to radially in wardly and outwardly move so that the output shaft 14 is driven to rotate about its axis of rotation.
