# Air circuit interrupter.

## Abstract
An air circuit interrupter which comprises a first cam driven by the operating handle 1 which, through a charge lever, charges an energy storing spring 5, a link mechanism 6 for transmitting the stored spring force to a contact operating mechanism, a contact opening waiting mechanism for pre venting the link mechanism from driving the contact operat ing mechanism to open, when the contact is closed, by an action of a spring force of a contacting pressure spring 14 in the contact operating mechanism and an electromagnetic repulsive force acting on a current carrying member due to a current above a predetermined value, and an OFF operating member 24 for opening the contact by releasing the contact opening waiting state of the contact opening waiting mechanism. The contact opening waiting mechan ism comprises a second cam 20 connected to the link mechanism and a trip latch 26 having an engaging roller 26a for engaging the second cam and an engaging portion for engaging the OFF operating member. The trip latch is constituted by a roller side latch half member 26A having the engaging roller and an engaging side latch half member 26B having the engaging portion, the half members being pivotally mounted on a common shaft 16. An elastic member 27 is inserted between the half members so that they are biased away from each other, and the half members of the trip latch are displaced toward each other against the elastic member by the action to release the contact opening waiting state to open the contact.
