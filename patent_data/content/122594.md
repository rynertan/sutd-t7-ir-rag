## Description
LINE CIRCUIT WITH COMPENSATION The present invention generally relates to a line circuit with echo compensation, and more particularly to a line circuit of the above type which is interposed between two lines operative for unidirectionally carrying digital signals and a single line operative for bidirectionally carrying analog signals, especially as used in telephony. When incoming and outgoing signals are transmitted through a common bidirectional transmission line including two wires, as they frequently are between a telephone subscriber circuit and local telephone exchange or a central office, there is encr iitered the problem that the incoming signals generate an echo response which may be transmitted back to vae point of origin of the incoming signals, where it is perceived as annoying interference. While this probe also exists in fully analog transmission systems, its existence is even more disturbing in communication systems which use digital signals, such as pulse code modulated PMC signals, for communication between the central offices or local telephone exchanges.In communication systems of this type, a coding and decoding arrangement, which will bei hereafter referred to as a line circuit, is interposed between the bidirectional analog subscriber line and the unidirectional digital lines. This line circuit processes the incoming digital signals and converts them to analog signals, and converts the outgoing analog signals into digital signals and processes the digital signals prior to sending them to the point of origin of the incoming signals. In this enronment, the presence of the echo response in the of going analog signal may severely interfere with the outgoing digital signals, especially when both parties to he telephone conversation talk at the same time. The problems resulting from the echo response to the incoming signals have already been recognized and attempts have been made to overcome the same. One conventional approach to this problem is to arrange an analog hybrid at the junction of the line circuit to the ectional line, and to provide the analog hybrid w t a balancing network including a line matching or terminating impedance which ideally matches the line eance. However, experience has shown that it is very difficult to obtain a matching impedance which would be effective over the entire range of frequencies included in the analog signal being transmitted, especially when the bidirectional line is less than perfectly designed.Also, it would be too cumbersome and time consuming to attempt to adjust the matching impedance for each of the lines individually. Thus, in practice, balancing networks with two different matching impedance values are being used, one for loaded lines and the other for unloaded lines. Yet, the impedances of both the loaded lines and the unloaded lines differ within relatively broad ranges from the matching impedances of the respective analog hybrids so that the analog hybrids, more often than not, only suppress but do not eliminate the effects of the echo response at the cordon junction of the line circuit to the biirectional line and thus in the transmit path. The imperfections of this conventional echo reducing technique have already been recognized and attempts have been made to overcome the same. So, for instance, the commonly assigned U.S. PatentNo. , 302, 631 discloses a line circuit of the type here under consIderation in which a finite impulse response FI filter is interposed between the receive path of the ine circuit upstream of the receive filter and the transmit path of the line circuit downstream of the trr rt t filter The FIR filter generates a correction sinarn based on the incoming digital signal, and the t as generated digital correction signal is combined with the transmitted digital signal in such a manner as t suppress the effect of the echo response on the transmitted digital signal. This arrangement is very advantageous in many respects however, because of the location at which the FIR filter is arranged, the FIR filter has to take the operation of the receive and transmit filters into consideration and, consequently, will be complicated. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a line circuit interposed between a bidirectional line and two unidirectional lines, which does not possess the disadvantages of the conventional line circuits of this type. Still another object of the present invention is to so construct the line circuit of the type here under consideration as effectively to counteract the effect of an echo response to incoming signals on the outgoing signals. It ist yet another object of the present invention t so design the above line circuit as to be simple in canstruction, inexpensive to ranufrcture, relatively eas to use, and reliable nevertheless. A concomitant object of the present invention is develop an arrangement for setting the coefficients as used in the line circuit of the above type for generating correction signals used in counteracting efect of the echo response on the outgoing signals. In pursuance of these objects and others which will become apparent hereafter, one feature of the rresent invention is embodied in a line circuit which is interposed between two unidirectional lines and a bidirectional line and which includes separate first and second paths in which first and second signals propagating respectively from one of the unidrectional lines toward a junction with the bidirectional line and from the junction toward the other unidirectional line appear as first and second digital signals with a predetermined sample rate and echo responses to the first signals appearing at the junction have an effect on the second signals. According to the invention, the first digital signals are derived from the first path at a sample rate lower than the predermined sample rate.Then digital correction signals are generated based on the first digital signals received at the lower sample rate, and the digital correction signals are so combined with the second digital signals in the second path as to compensate at least partially for the effect of the echo responses on the second digital signals. The sample rate of the digital correction signals is increased to the predetermined sample rate before the digital correction signals are combined with the second digital signals. A particular advantage of the line circuit as described so far resides in the fact that, by stev down the sample rate at which the first signals are supplied to the means for generating the digital cor rection of the generating means, that is, to use a lower number of components than would be necassary f the generating means operated at the predetermine sample rate. The aformentioned first and second pays are advantageously situated between the processing means for the incoming digital signals and the digital to analog converter means, on the one hand, and between the analog to digital converter means and the means for processing the outgoing digital signals, on the other hand. In this manner, it is achieved that the generating means, preferably an FIR filter, does not have to take the response of the receive and transmit digital signal processing means into consideration in generating the correction signals. According to another aspect of the present invention, the line circuit further comprises means for determining the coefficients which are used in the FIR filter for generating the correction signals, this determining means being used while no correction signals are being combined with the second signals in the second path.The determining means advantageously includes means for sending a training pattern of discrete pulses having magnitudes reflecting the influence of the receIve and transmit signal processing means on the first and second signals, as the first signals into the first path through the receive signal processing means, means or sensing the second signals appearing at the output of the transmitter signal processing means in response to the training pattern, and means for ex. ing successive outputs of the sensing means in reszse to the training pattern as the values for settft the coefficients.This approach is advantageous La the values of the rexpective coefficients can be directly extracted from the response to the training pattefl , without involving expensive manipulations or rearing access to the first and second paths. Above mentioned and other features and objects of this invention will become more apparent by reference to the following description taken in conjuction with the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a diagrammatic representation of the line circuit of the present invention as interposed between an analog bidirectional line and two digital unidirectional lines Figure 2 is a diagrammatic representation of a currently preferred construction of an arrangement for combining correction signals with transmitted signals for use in the line circuit of Figure 1 Figure 3 is a diagrammatic representation including the line circuit of Figure 1 and additional elements operative for setting the coefficients used in generating the correction signals and Figure 4 is a graphic representation of a training pattern used in the arrangement of Figure 3 for determining the values of the coefficients. Referring now to the drawing in detail and first to Fig. 1, it may be seen that the reference numeral 1 has been used to indentify a line circuit according to the present invention in its entirety. The line circuit 1 ist interposed between a bidirectional two wire line 2, and two unidirectional lines 3 and 4. In operation, the bidirectional line 2 carries analog signals, line 3, incoming digital signals, and line 4 outgoing digital signals. Advantageously, the incoming and outgoing digital signals are pulse code modulated PCM signals. The incoming digital signals arriving at the line circuit 1 first reach an input output interface 5 where they are processed in a conventional manner. Such processing usually involves stepping up of the sample rate of the incoming digital signal, such as by insertion of zero samples and also expansion from compressed p law to linear format. The incoming digital signals then proceed to a receive filter and gain arrangement 6 to be processed, also in a conventional manner, before entering a first path 7. The receive filter and gain arrangement 6 preferably includes a digital filter, especially a recursive one.A filter of this type, which is in widespread use in the telecommunication field, is basically a binary logic unit which performs mathematical operations on the digital signals reaching the same to convert such siara s in digital signals having the desired properties, such as a high signal to noise ratio. The c tal signals propagating in the first path 7 then reac a digital to analog converter arrangement 8 to be converted, in a conventional manner, into analog signals w cr then propaaate through a connection line 9 to an analog hybrid 10.The analog hybrid 10 is of any conven Dn construction and includes a balancing network Z that includes a constant impedance, such as 900 ohms analog hybrid 10 is connected to the bidirectional line 2. Another connecting line 12 leads from the analog hybrid 10 to an analog todigital converter arrangement 13 and carries analog signals from the former to the latter The analogto digital converter arrant 13 converts the outgoing analog signal intodigital signals which are issued into a second path 14 and appear in the latter at the aforementioned stepped up sample rate.A transmit filter and gain arrangement 15, which advantageously includes digital filters, especially recursive digital filters, of a construction and mode of operation similar to those of the receive filter, acts on the outgoing signals received from the second path 14. After leaving the transmit filter and gain arrangement 15, the digital signals to be transmitted reach the input ouput interface 5 from where they enter the unidirectional line 4 as processed digital signals, for instance, in the PCM format. The processing of the transmitted signals in the input output interface 5 ussually involves stepping down of the sample rate to the same level as that of the incoming PCM signals and compression to T or A law format. Thus, the receive and transmit signals undergo several rate changes. In the transmit direction, after analogto digital conversion preferably by encoding by a delta sigma circuit at 4MHz, the signal is decimated to 32 kHz and passes through the transmit filters 15, being decimated again to 8 kHz before compression for transmission as PCM. In the receive direction the 8 kHzPCM signal is expanded and interpolated up to 32 kHz sample rate by the receive filtering. After this it goes to the interpolator and D A8 where it is stepped up to 512 kHz before being reconstituted as an analog audio signal. The expression sample rate as used herein refers to the rate at which the individual samples to 512 kHz before being reconstituted as an analog audio signal. The expression sample rate as used herein refers to the rate at which the individual samples occur.Each sample contains a word in the particular digital code, such as an 8 bit word in PCM and, for instance, a 16 bit word in serial form in each of the paths 7 and 14. An echo compensating unit 16 is interposed between the first path 7 and the second path 14. The unit 16 includes a digital hybrid 17 which will be described in more detail below, a stepping down unit 18 which is interposed between the first path 7 and the digital hybrid 17, an adding arrangement 19 interposed in the second path 14, and a stepping up unit 20 interposed between the digital hybrid 17 and the adding arrangement 19. The stepping down unit 18 is operative for reducing the sample rate from the sample rate of the digital signals propagating in the first path 7 to a lower sample rate, preferably to that of the incoming signals received from the unidirectional line 3, that is, in the given example, to 8 kHz. The stepping up arrangement 20 is operative for increasing the lowered sample rate 8 kHz to the sample rate of the transmitter signals propagating through the second path 14, that is, to 32 kHz or 32 k words sec with each word containing a series of 16 binary bits in the given example Each such word constitutes the respective first or second digital signal. Referring now to Fig. 2 which shows certain details of a currently preferred embodiment of the echo compensating unit 16, it may be seen that the digital hybrid 17 is constructed as a finite impulse response FIR filter including, as illustrated, three consecutively arranged shift registers or similar data storage arrangements 21, 22 and 23, each capable of storing a word. The stepping down arrangement 18 is illustrated to include a switch 24 which is interposed between the first path 7 and the storage arrangement 21 and is operable between its sample and hold states.Similar switches 25 and 26 are interposed respectively between the output of the storage arrangement 21 and the input of the storage arrangement 22 and between the output of the storage arrangement 22 and the input of the storage arrangement 23. The switches 24 to 26 are ganged with one another such that they are simultaneously operated between their sample and hold states. In the sample states of the switches 24 to 26, date derived from the first path 7 is fed into the storage arrangement 21, while the contents of the storage arrangement 21 is simultaneously fed into the storage arrangement 22 and the contents of the storage arrangement 22 is simultaneously transferred into the storage arrangement 23.On the other hand, when the switches 24 to 26 assume their hold states, the contents of the respective storage arrangements 21 to 23 are recirculated back ino the very same storage arrangements 21 to 23 through respective loops 27, 28 and 29. The reference numeral 30 has been used to designate an arrangement for simultaneously operating the switches 24 to 26 between their sample and hold states. The operating arrangement 30 operates at a sample rate lower than the sample rate of the signals propagating through the first path 7.It is currently preferred so to operate the operating arrangement 30 that the switches 24 to 26 are in their sample states for one out of every four samples of the signal propagating in the first path 7, while the switches 24 to 26 are in their hold states for the remaining three samples of the signals propagating in the first path 7. Thus, the switch 24 acts as a decimator which reduces the sample rate of the signals entering the digital hybrid 17 to one fourth of the sample rate of the digital signals propagating in the first path 7. The digital hybrid 17 which may be a FIR filter further includes multiplying arrangements 31, 32 and 33 in which the respective outputs of the storage arrangements 21, 22 and 23 as they appear in the lines 27, 28 and 29, respectively, are multipXEd by respective coefficients aO, a1 and aq that are respectively stored in storage arrangements 34, 35 and 36. It is currently proposed to store the coefficients aO, a11 a2 in the form of 5 binary bit words. The multiplication products are then added to one another in an adding arrangement 37 to obtain a correction signal which appears in an output line 38.Figur 2 also shows setting lines 39, 40 and 41 which are connected to the respective storage arrangements 34, 35 and 36 and which may be used for setting the values of the coefficients aO, a1 and a2, for instance, in a manner which will be discussed in detail later. The multiplying arrangements 31, 32 and 33 may be constructed as conventional digital serial multipliers, and the adding arrangement 37 may be constructed as a conventional digital serial adder. Thus, the FIR filter 17 operates in the digital domain and the correction signal appearing in the output line 38 is a digital correction signal. The stepping up arrangement 20 is shown in Fig. 2 to be constituted by an AND gate 20 which has the output line 38 of the FIR filter 17 connected to one of its inputs, and a timing line connected to its other input.A connecting line 42 connects the output of the AND gate 20 to the inverting input of the adding arrangement 19 which has its non inverting input and its ouput connected to the second path 14. Of course, the gate 2C could also be a NAND gate and the connecting line 42 could be connected to a non inverting input of the adder 19 which is preferably constructed as a serial adder of a conventional construction. The particulars of this part of the arrangement will depend on the values of the correction signals relative to the values of the signals propagating in the second path 14 toward the adder 19, such that the correction signals are combined with the signals propagating in the second path 14 and reaching the adder 19 in counterphase thereto.The gate 20 is operated by the timing signals in such a manner as to bring the sample rate of the correction signals appearing in the connecting line 42 up to the sample rate of the signals propagating in the second path 14. It ist currently preferred that the gate 20 increase the sample rate fourfold in that the gate 20 opens, in a predetermined time relation to the 2operation of the operating means 30, for one of every four samples of the signal propagating in the second path 14 to let the correction signals pass therethrough to the adder 19, while being closed for the remaining three of the samples. As indicated in Fig. 1, the elements 5 to 8 and 13 to 20 are preferably provided on a single chip 43 Figur 4 . This, in most instances, means that the first and second paths 7 and 14 are inaccessible. If access could be had to the first and second paths 7 and 14, it would be relatively simple to arrive at the desired values of the aforementioned coefficients aO, a1 and a2 by simply feeding a series of pulses into the first path 7 while the unit 16 is disabled such that no correction signals are fed to the adder 19, and by extracting the effect of the echo responses to the aforementtoned series of pulses from the second path 14 and using the extracting values for setting the coefficients a a1 and a2. As it is with a single chip 43, access mr be bad to the input and output lines 3 and 4, but usually not to the first and second paths 7 and 14. It is still possible to send a test pattern of discrete pulses into the line 3, and extract the response from the line 4.Yet, under such circumstances, the test signals sent into the input line 3 are processed by a signal processing arrangement including the input output interface 5 and receive filter and gain arrangement 6, and the reflected echo response signals are processed by another signal processing arrangement including the transmitter filter and gain arrangement 15 and the input output interface 5 before reaching the output line 4. The echo response signals appearing in t line 4 reflect the effect of the signal process,Âµ means 5, 6, 15 und 5 on the incoming testing signal, on the one hand, and on the echo response signals on the other hand. Hence, the influence of the signal processing means 5, 6 and 15, 5 has to be compensated for before it is possible to obtain the values of the coefficients aO, a1 and a2. To achieve this compensation, it is currently proposed to send a repeated series of pulses into the input line 3, these pulses being far enough apart that the echos from successive pulses do not interfere. It is currently preferred to space the individual pulses apart by four milliseconds. The testing signal is now periodic and can be represented as the sum of a number of discrete sinusoidal waves. The effect of the signal processing means 5, 6 and 15, 5 on such sinusoidal wave components is known and can be counteracted by simply preshifting the components by the amplitude and phase equivalent of the effects of the signal processing means 5, 6 and 15, 5 on the respective signals.Then, the components are recombined to form a single new periodic test signal, which will be hereafter called a coefficient training pattern. An example of the coefficient training pattern is shown in Figur 3 of the drawing. A practical implementation of the above approach is illustrated in Figur 4. The test pattern is stored as a plurality of 8 bit test words in a ROM unit t4 which is addressed by a program. counter 45 to successively feed the test words stored in the ROM 44 into a shift register 46 that is controlled by a clock and load command. The 8 bits of the respective test word are then fed into the input line 3 and, after ssing through the chip or codec 43, they reach the analog hybrid 10 and the line 2.The echo responses proceed from the analog hybrid 10 into and through the codec 43 while no correction signals are combined with the signals passing through the codec 43 toward the output line 4The signals in the output line 4 are fed ic three serially arranged 8 bit registers 47, 48 an 49. Since these signals are in the PCM format, the are fed into a read expand unit 50 of a conventional construction from where they are supplied as respective bit words respectively to the lines 39, 40 and 41 to set the coefficients aO, a1 and a. In practice, the test pattern or coefficient training pattern is sent into the line 3, cycling through 32 word cycle N times as necessary after a minimum 32 word delay, preferably longer, for the recursive filters to settle. Thereafter, the first three words that echo back are read from the respective shift registers 47, 48 and 49. After expansion and truncation in the read expand unit 50, there are obtained actual coefficients aO, a1 and a2 which can be fed into the codec 43 through the lines 39, 40 and 41 to set up the coefficient storage arrangements 34, 35 and 36. It ist further contemplated by the present invention to average at least three words in every frame for a number of frames, such as to improve the noise immunity. If the averaging is performed over four frames, the time span is 16 milliseconds which gives excellent rejection against 60 Hz.
