CH2OH, with triphenylphosphine, di alkyl azodicarboxylate, where alkyl is methyl or ethyl, and a phenol of formula AroH, where Ar is a category i or ii Ar group. Macrolides of formula I or II wherein R isOAr or Q is CH2OAr and Ar is optionally substituted benzoyl, phenylacetyl, phenylpropionyl, phenoxyacetyl, or phenylthioacetyl are prepared by reacting a macrolide of formula II wherein Q is CH2OH with an acylating agent derived from a carboxylic acid of formula ArOH, where Ar is as defined above. Typical acylating agents include anhydrides, acid halides usually in combination with a base or other acid scavenger , and active esters.Suitable organic solvents include pyridine and triethylamine. Acylation can also be achieved using a mixture of an organic acid and a dehydrating agent such asN,N dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. Macrolides of formula I or II wherein R isOAr or Q is CH2OAr and Ar is an acyl group as defined in the previous paragraph are also prepared using the di alkyl azodicarboxylate triphenylphosphine procedure, i.e., by reacting a macrolide of formula II wherein Q is CH2OH with triphenylphosphine, di alkyl azodicarboxylate, and a carboxylic acid of the formula ArOH. Macrolides of formula I or II wherein R isOAr or Q is CH2OAr and Ar is methanesulfonyl, trifluoromethanesulfonyl or optionally substituted phenylsulfonyl are prepared by reacting a macrolide of formula I wherein Q is CH2OH with an activated derivative, such as the anhydride or acid halide, of a sulfonic acid of the formula ArOH.

Macrolides of formula I or II wherein R is phthalimido, or Q is CH2 phthalimido are prepared by reacting a macrolide of formula II wherein Q is CH2OH with triphenylphosphine, di alkyl azodicarboxylate, and phthalimide. Compounds of formula I or II wherein R4 or L is methanesulfonyl, trifluoromethanesulfonyl or optionally substituted phenylsulfonyl, as well as compounds wherein R or L is iodo or bromo, are useful as intermediates for the preparation of additional compounds of this invention via SNÚ or SN2 substitution reactions. Suitable reaction conditions for displacing a leaving group by a nucleophile via either an SN1 orSN2 mechanism are well exemplified in the art of nucleophilic substitution reactions. The formula I or Il compounds wherein R is 7 and R7 is an acyl group are prepared via the 20 azido derivative R N3 . The 20 azido derivative is first reduced to the 20 amino derivative R triphenylphosphine in aqueous tetrahydrofuran THF is an example of a suitable reducing agent for this purpose. The 20 amino derivative can then be selectively acylated on the amino group, using standard acylation procedures, to give those derivatives wherein R7 is an acyl group. Macrolides of formula I or II wherein R is N R6 2 or R9 or Q is CH2N R6 2 or CH2R9 can be prepared by reductive amination of the C 20 aldehyde group ofDMT, OMT, DMOT, and DOMT using one of two methods.Method 1 A derivative with a leaving group at C 20 iodo, triflate, etc. , prepared as described supra, is reacted with the appropriate amine in a suitable solvent, such as acetonitrile, until the desired 20 modified derivative is formed via displacement of the C 20 leaving group by the nucleophilic amine.Method 2 In this method, the aldehyde group of compound 2, 4, 6, or 8 is reacted directly with the corresponding amine in the presence of a suitable reducing agent in an appropriate solvent until the desired product is formed.Sodium cyanoborohydride is an example of a suitable reducing agent, and anhydrous methanol is a useful solvent for this reaction. The reaction may be carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere, but this is usually not required. With less reactive amines, more forcing conditions for forming the intermediate iminium complex between the macrolide and amine may be required, e.g.heating, use of a drying agent or water scavenger or heating under conditions of azeotropic removal of water in solvents such as benzene or toluene. Methods for modifying the C 23 position The desired group at the C 23 position is likewise obtained by using an available starting material that already has the desired group at the C 23 position, or by modifying the C 23 position of an available starting material. Known macrolides of formula II wherein Q1is hydroxyl include DMT 2 , dihydro DMT 3 , OMT 4 , dihydro OMT 5 , DH DO DMT 10 , and DH DO OMT 11 . Macrolides of formula I or II wherein R1 or qs Q1 is hydroxyl can be prepared by acid hydrolysis of a macrolide of formula II wherein Q1 isEMI23.1 The hydrolysis is carried out at a pH between 1.5 and 2.5, as described in U.S. Patent No. 3,459,853. Macrolides of formula I or II wherein R1 or Q1 is hydroxyl can be modified to give other macrolides of formula I using the methods described hereinbefore for converting a C 20 hydroxyl group to the desired group. Thus, the DEAD reaction may be used to effect many of the C 23 modifications. Other procedures for modification of the C 23 position are described byA. Tanaka et al in J. Antibiotics 35 1 113 116 1982 . Another process applicable to C 23 modifications is a two step process in which the 23 hydroxyl group is first converted to a leaving group, and the leaving group is then displaced by a suitable nucleophile. First, the 23 hydroxyl group is converted to a suitable leaving group, such groups being well known in the art. The triflate anion is a preferred leaving group. With very reactive nucleophiles, however, other leaving groups, such as the mesylate anon, the tosylate anion, iodide or bromide may also be suitable. The 23 O triflate is preferably prepared by reaction of the 23 OH intermediate with an activated derivative of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, such as the anhydride, preferably in the presence of a hindered pyridine derivative such as 2,6 lutidine or s collidine at a temperature of from 800c to room temperature. The hydroacyl groups at positions other than 23 may be protected by acetyl groups which can be removed by methanolysis, for instance by refluxing in methanol.Using this procedure, the 23 O triflate can be prepared without concomitant reactions at the other hydroxyl groups which are present. A similar reaction can be used to prepare the corresponding mesylate or tosylate directly. When triflate is used as the leaving group, it is not necessary to isolate the intermediate triflate derivative displacement with the appropriate nucleophile can be carried out in situ. When less reactive leaving groups are used, the intermediate is sufficiently stable and may be isolated prior to the displacement reaction if so desired. The second step in the preparation of the C 23 modified derivatives involves displacement of the leaving group by the appropriate nucleophile under suitable conditions which are well exemplified in the art of displacement reactions. When is is desired to prepare compounds of formula II in which QÚ is SR5 the most convenient nucleophile is a compound of formula HSR5. For preparation of an azide, the nucleophile is preferably an alkali metal azide such as lithium azide. The pyridinium compound is preferably prepared by reaction with pyridine base. When Q1 is NR6R7 or R9, the nucleophile is an amine of the formula HNR6R7 or BUR9. The nucleophilic displacement reaction is preferably conducted at temperatures in the range from 800C to 1000C, typically room temperature using an inert organic solvent such as a chlorinated hydrocarbon like dichloromethane. The C 23 derivatives wherein R1 is NHR7 can be prepared via the 23 azido derivative R N3 . The 23 azido derivative is first reduced to the 23 amino derivative using a reducing agent specific to azido groups, such as chromous chloride or triphenylphosphine. Aqueous organic solvents such as ethereal solvents, for example tetrahydrofuran THF are useful for this purpose. The reduction can be effected at temperatures in the range from 0 to 1000C, The 23 amino derivative can then be selectively acylated using standard acylation procedures, to give those derivatives wherein R7 is an acyl group. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art the acylation can be effected at temperatures in the range of from 20 to 700C. It should be noted thatr when the compounds of formulas 3 or 5 are used as starting materials, two primary hydroxyl groups are present which react in a similar manner. The primary hydroxyl group at C 20, however, is usually replaced more rapidly than the hydroxyl group at C 23. Although many of the procedures described supra give mixtures of 20 monosubstituted derivatives and 20,23 disubstituted derivatives, such mixtures can be readily separated by techniques known in the art, such as, for example, chromatography using silica gel as the adsorbant. Formation of C 20 monosubstituted derivatives may be optimized by not carrying the reaction to completion, for example, by using less than two molar equivalents of reactant s .Conversely, when C 20, C 23 disubstituted derivatives are sought, the reaction should be carried to completion and two molar equivalents or an excess of reactant s should be used. Compounds wherein the substituent R1 differs from the substituent R can be prepared by modifying the hydroxyl group at C 23 before reducing the aldehyde atC 20. When preparing formula I compounds wherein R is hydrogen, compounds 10 and 11 may be used as starting materials and modified at the C 23 hydroxyl group as previously described. An alternate method for preparing compounds with different substituents at C 20 and C 23 is to modify the C 20 position of a macrolide not having a free C 23 hydroxyl group. One example of this approach is to prepare a C 20 modified derivative of desmycosin, tylosin, macrocin, lactenocin, demethylmacrocin and demethyllactenocin, followed by hydrolysis at the neutral sugar s , using procedures known in the art see, for example, U.S. Patent 3,459,853 . By this procedure, a 20 modified derivative of OMT can be selectively prepared, which in turn can be modified at the C 23 position, as discussed supra. Use of a protecting group for the hydroxyl group at C 23 of OMT and DMT prior to reduction of the aldehyde also permits selective modification of C 20.Removal of the protecting group after appropriate modification of C 20 yields C 20 modified derivatives having a hydroxyl group at C 23, which may then be modified as outlined previously. Examples of useful protecting groups are ester moieties, such as acetyl and trichloroacetyl, and groups such as tetrahydropyranyl and tetrahydrofuranyl. The tetrahydropyranyl and tetrahydrofuranyl protecting groups are described, for example, by Tanaka et al., supra. The modified derivatives of OMT, DOMT andDH DO OMT can also be prepared by acidic hydrolysis of mycarose from the corresponding modified derivatives ofDMT, DMOT and DH DO DMT, respectively, prepared by the methods previously described. Procedures for the acidic hydrolysis of mycarose from DMT and DMOT to form OMT andDOMT, respectively, are found in U.S. Patents 4,321,361 and 4,321,362. Acidic hydrolysis of DH DO DMT to giveDH DO OMT is described in U.S. Patent 4,304,856. More specifically, the mycarose sugar can be hydrolytically cleaved at a pH of less than 4, preferably in the range from 0.5 to 2.0, at a temperature in the range of from 0 to 600C, conveniently at about room temperature. The hydrolysis can be effected using a strong aqueous mineral acid such as hydrochloric or sulfuric acid or a strong organic acid such as p toluenesulfonic acid. A method of preparing 4 deoxydesmycosin is described in J. of Antibiotics 34, 1381 84 1981 . The process involves 1 treatment of desmycosin with acidic ethanol in accordance with a procedure described inAntibiot. Chemoth. 11, 320 27 1961 , to obtain the corresponding diethylacetal 2 acylation of the diethylacetal with acetic anhydride in acetonitrile in the absence of external base, in accordance with a procedure described in J.Org. Chem. 44, 2050 52 1979, to obtain the 2 ,4 di O acetyl derivative 3 reacting the 21,4 di O acetyl derivative with 2,3 dihydrofuran in dichloromethane in the presence of pyridinium p toluenesulfonate in the manner described in J. Orq. Chem. 42, 3772 74 1974 to obtain the 3,4 bis O tetrahydrofuranyl derivative 4 removal of the 2 and 4 O acetyl groups by dissolving the product of step 3 in methanol 500C, overnight 5 reacting the product of step 4 with 1.5 mole equivalent of benzenesulfonyl chloride in pyridine at 400C for 4 hours, to provide the 4 O benzenesulfonyl derivative 6 immediately reacting the 4 O benzenesulfonyl derivative with 1.5 equivalent of sodium iodide in methyl ethyl ketone at 1800C for 15 minutes to obtain 4 iodo derivative 7 reductively deiodinating the 4 iodo derivative using tri n butyl stannane in benzene in the presence of 2,2 azobis isobutyronitrile at 800C for 2 hours and 8 deblocking the diethylacetal and tetrahydrofuranyl groups by hydrolysis of the product of step 7 in .1M aqueous hydrochloric acid acetonitrile 2.5 1 v v for 30 minutes at 250C to obtain 4 deoxydesmycosin. The 4 deoxy derivatives of this invention, i.e. the compounds of formula I wherein R3 is hydrogen, are readily prepared by procedures analogous to those described supra, using 4 deoxy OMT, 4 deoxy DOMT or 4 deoxy DH DO OMT as the starting material. These starting materials can be prepared via procedures outlined in J. Antibiotics 34, 1381 1384 1981 .Alternatively, deoxygenation at 4 may be accomplished in OMT, DOMT or DH DO OMT subsequent to modification of the C 20 and or C 23 positions. The formula I compounds which are ester derivatives are prepared by esterifying the respectiveC 20 and or C 23 modified derivative on the 2 , 4 , and or 23 hydroxyl groups when present by treatment with acylating agents, using standard methods exemplified in the art. The preparation of 2 O ester derivatives of the C 20 and or C 23 modified derivatives is accomplished by procedures similar to those described byBaltz et El. in U.S. Patents 4,321,361 and 4,321,362.Esterification of the 2 , 4 and or 23 hydroxyl groups of these modified derivatives may be accomplished by acylation of the hydroxyl groups using similar procedures as outlined in the previously discussed applications serial Nos. 330,341, 330,295, and 330,294. Alternatively, the formula I compounds which are esters may be prepared by starting with the appropriate esters of compounds 2 11, prepared as described supra. Furthermore, it should be noted that the formula I ester compounds can be hydrolyzed to yield the corresponding formula I compounds, thus utilizing the esters as protecting groups during reactions to modify the C 20 and or C 23 positions. The C 20 modified derivatives of this invention form salts, particularly acid addition salts.These acid addition salts are also useful as antibiotics and are a part of this invention. In another aspect, such salts are useful as intermediates, for example, for separating and purifying the derivatives. In addition, the salts have an improved solubility in water. Representative suitable salts include those salts formed by standard reactions with both organic and inorganic acids such as, for example, sulfuric, hydrochloric, phosphoric, acetic, succinic, citric, lactic, maleic, fumaric, palmitic, cholic, pamoic, mucic,D glutamic, d camphoric, glutaric, glycolic, phthalic, tartaric, formic, lauric, stearic, salicylic, methanesulfonic benzenesulfonic, sorbic, picric, benzoic, cinnamic, and like acids.

Certain of the formula I compounds of this invention have also shown in vivo activity against infections induced by gram negative bacteria. Table V summarizes the results of tests in which illustrative compounds were evaluated against a Pasteurella infection in one day old chicks. The compounds were administered parenterally af ter challenge of the chicks with Pasteu rella multocida 0.1 ml of a 10 4 dilution of a twenty hour tryptose broth culture of an avian P. multocida given subcutaneously . In these tests, unless indicated otherwise, all non medicated infected chicks died within 24 hours of Pasteurella challenge. In the tests summarized in Table V, the compounds were administered by subcutaneous injection at a dosage of 30 mg kg, 1 and 4 hours post challenge of the chicks with P. multocida.

Another preferred group are the formula I compounds wherein R is OH or OAr and Ar is a group iii substituent.Still another group of compounds preferred for in vitro activity against gram positive bacteria and for activity against MYcoPlasma species are the formula I compounds wherein R1 is R9. This invention also relates to methods of controlling infections caused by gram positive bacteria and Hvcoplasma species. In carrying out the methods of this invention, an effective amount of a specified formula I compound is administered parenterally to an infected or susceptible warm blooded animal. The dose which is effective to control the infection will vary with the severity of the infection and the age, weight, and condition of the animal. The total dose required for protection parenterally will generally, however, be in the range of from about 1 to about 100 mg kg and preferably will be in the range of from about 1 to about 50 mg kg. Suitable dosage regimens can be constructed. In another aspect, this invention relates to compositions useful for the control of infections caused by gram positive bacteria and Mycoplasma species. These compositions comprise a specified compound of formula 1 together with a suitable vehicle. Compositions may be formulated for parenteral administration by methods recognized in the pharmaceutical art. Effective injectable compositions containing these compounds may be in either suspension or solution form. In the preparation of suitable formulations it will be recognized that, in general, the water solubility of the acid addition salts is greater than that of the free bases. Similarly, the bases are more soluble in dilute acids or in acidic solutions than in neutral or basic solutions. In the solution form the compound is dissolved in a physiologically acceptable vehicle. Such vehicles comprise a suitable solvent, preservatives such as benzyl alcohol, if needed, and buffers. Useful solvents include, for example, water and aqueous alcohols, glycols, and carbonate esters such as diethyl carbonate. Such aqueous solutions contain, in general, no more than 50 of the organic solvent by volume. Injectable suspension compositions require a liquid suspending medium, with or without adjuvants, as a vehicle. The suspending medium can be, for example, aqueous polyvinylpyrrolidone, inert oils such as vegetable oils or highly refined mineral oils, or aqueous carboxymethylcellulose. Suitable physiologically acceptable adjuvants are necessary to keep the compound suspended in suspension compositions. The adjuvants may be chosen from among thickeners such as carboxymethylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gelatin, and the alginates. Many surfactants are also useful as suspending agents.Lecithin, alkylphenol polyethylene oxide adducts, naphthalenesulfonates, alkylbenenesulfonates, and the polyoxyethylene sorbitan esters are useful suspending agents. Many substances which affect the hydrophilicity, density, and surface tension of the liquid suspending medium can assist in making injectable suspensions in individual cases. For example, silicone anti foams, sorbitol, and sugars can be useful suspending agents.

Often the most practical way to administer the compounds is by formulation into the feed supply or drinking water. A variety of feeds, including the common dry feeds, liquid feeds, and pelleted feeds, may be used. The methods of formulating drugs into animal feeds are well known. A preferred method is to make a concentrated drug premis which in turn is used to prepare medicated feeds. Typical premixes may contain from about 1 to about 200 grams of drug per pound of premix. Premixes may be either liquid or solid preparations. The final formulation of feeds for animals or poultry will depend upon the amount of drug to be administered. The common methods of formulating, mixing, and pelleting feeds may be used to prepare feeds containing a compound of formula I . Many substances which affect the hydrophilicity, density, and surface tension of the liquid suspending medium can assist in making injectable suspensions in individual cases. For example, silicone antifoams, sorbitol, and sugars can be useful suspending agents.
