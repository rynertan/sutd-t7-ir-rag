# Tape recorder.

## Abstract
A motor 42 of a motor drive mechanism is driven by a logic control circuit and a motor driving circuit when an operating member for tape feed is operated. A shift control mechanism 42 receiving a forward or reverse rotatory force from the motor 42 controls for a specified condition a pinch roller 51, 52 included in a tape drive mechanism by means of a playback slider 47 , and also controls a head for a predetermined position by means of a head slider 48 . Thus, the motor drive mechanism can establish a forward or reverse tape feed mode in a tape recorder.
