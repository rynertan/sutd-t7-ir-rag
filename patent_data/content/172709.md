# Method of applying droplets of an adhesive using an ink jet printer apparatus.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method for applying droplets 65 of an adhesive composition to a surface 67 via one or more nozzles 61 characterised in that the nozzle is a nozzle of a continuous ink jet printing apparatus. Preferably, the adhesive is fed under pressure to the nozzle from which the adhesive issues as a single stream 64 , the stream is stimulated to break up the stream into substantially uniform ly sized and spaced apart droplets, the droplets are selective ly charged and passed through a deflecting electric field whereby the droplets are caused to follow a selected flight path either to a selected position on the surface or to a catching means 66 .
