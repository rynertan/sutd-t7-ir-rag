# Reinforced foam laminates and a process for their manufacture.

## Abstract
The laminates have a core of rigid isocyanurate based foam sandwiched between two facing sheets which are preferably non combustible. Embedded in the core, substantially throughout its thickness, are multiple layers of a mesh of continuous glass fibre strands which is readily permeable to the foam forming ingredients. Each layer of the mesh is substantially parallel to the facing sheets.
