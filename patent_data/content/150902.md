# Fan folded paper refolding apparatus.

## Abstract
A compact and lightweight paper refolding apparatus which fits over the top of a computer printer so as to refold the paper into a neat stack with a minimum of desk space. The re folding apparatus is designed so that the computer printout exiting web of paper can be read and refolded in the same pat tern as it had been folded in the stack on the supply side of the printer. This is accomplished by use of an L shaped member 4 having a curved guide means 14 with a receiving edge 15 , receiving the leading edge of the web of paper 3 exiting from the printer 1 and guiding it upwardly through a curved path and then downwardly onto a refolding surface. Since the base of the L shaped member 4 forms the refolding surface, which is designed to fit directly over the printer 1 , additional space for the refolding apparatus is not required and the computer printout is neatly stacked in the same fold pattern as had ex isted in the box or stack on the supply side of the printer.

## Description
FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to apparatus for receiving and refolding in fan fold arrangement a web of paper exiting from a computer printer. More specifically, this invention relates to a lightweight compact and economical apparatus which takes up little if any desk space for receiving and refolding the output of a computer printer. Still more specifically, this invention relates to an apparatus which is of economical constuction which will receive and which will refold the computer printout into the same fold pattern as had existed on the supply side of the printer.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Paper stacking systems are well known and are utilized in a wide variety of applications. A typical application is that in which fan fold paper and other forms are fed into printers and the like for printing data typically exiting from a computer, the data being processed in a high speed fashion. Paper on the supply side is normally withdrawn from the carton or box from which it is purchased, and p assed through the printer where the printing takes place. The paper is then fed in an incremental or in line by line fashion through an output slot in the printer in order to be stacked in a paper stacker or a basket.Insofar, however, as applicant is aware, there has not been introduced on the market or made available to the public a small and lightweight refolding apparatus for personal computers or the like which take no additional desk space and which require no moving parts. Most personal computers are used in the home or in the office, where space is rather limited, as opposed to a computer room that is designed for a computer and all the nprinheral eauinment. Generally. the computer, monitor, keyboard and printer are placed on an ordinary desk or table which has one or two sides against the wall. There is little space for the input fan fold paper supply, and even less space beside, below. or around the desk for any handling device for the output from the printer. As a consequence, such output is now caught manually taking a great deal of time and attention, or it falls in a jumble wherever it will be retrieved and refolded at a later time, hopefully, undamaged in the process. One proposal has been to elevate the printer so that paper can be stored underneath, thus requiring no additional desk space. This does not solve the problem in the storage of the output from the printer which does require the use of additional space surrounding the desk or additional space on the desk.BACKGROUND OF THE PRIOR ART Applicant is aware of the following proposals which have been made by various patentees in the past.Patent No. Inventor . Date 1,856,972 Sherman, et al 1932 2,779,450 Cecum, et al 1957 3,178,172 Lettan 1965 3,278,178 Eckl 1966 3,460,825 Diets et al 1969 3,464,610 Koning 1969 3,514,096 fuller 1970 3,712,607 Ziegler et al 1973 3,991,993 Clouthier 1976 Patent No. Inventor Date 4,054,235 Witcher 1977 4,226,410 McIntosh, Sr. et al 1980 The Patent to Muller 3,514,096 illustrates a paper feed and refolding guide mechanism, including curved sheet metal plates which form a passageway through which the web of paper is fed. The Ziegler et al patent 3,712,607 relates to guides and stacking mechanisms for continuous paper forms during their passage from a printing device over a guide and through a stacking mechanism to a collecting table. The patent to blecum et al 2,779,450 provides a means for guiding continuous folded forms so that upon ejection from an accounting or typewriting machine, the forms will automatically refold into a stack. The patent to Koning 3,464,610 discloses a fan folded paper stacker which is used with printers in data processing systems. This patent, however, utilizes a forward and backward oscillating motion to insure the fold and additionally uses a chamber having reduced air pressure below the paper web. The patent to Lettan 3,178,172 is directed to handling apparatus for folding material and includes a receiver for receiving zig zag forms. The patent to McIntosh Sr., et al 4,226,410 illustrates a stacking system for fan fold paper and the like and includes a paper catching basket. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to the present invention, the paper refolding apparatus fits directly over the printer in such a way that additional desk space is not required. If desired, the printer can be raised and the supply side carton of paper can be placed below Llle printer so Lhat even less space is required. Nevertheless, applicant has provided a simple Lshaped member having a curved guide means suspended from a vertical back, which receives the output of the printer and takes it through a curved path and then directs it downwardly toward the base of the L shaped member which forms the refolding surface.Additionally, according to this present invention, there is a proximal stop and guide means so that the integrity of the fold pattern of the web as it existed in the carton or on the stack of the supply side is maintained on the refolding surface. It is necessary only for the operator to manually manipulate the leading edge of the print out of the paper web so as to assure that the integrity of the fold pattern be maintained on both sides of the printer.DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS Referring now to the drawing, Fig. 1 is a view in perspective illustrating the refolding apparatus of the present invention in place over a typical personal type of printer. Figs 2 6 illustrate the process of feeding the web of paper from the supply side to the printer and threading it into the guide means of the refolding apparatus for refolding in the pattern which existed in the carton or box on the supply side. Figs. 7 10 are diagramatic illustrations again illustrating the manual manipulation of the first fold issuing from the printer which is required to allow for subsequent automatic refolding of the paper web in the fold pattern as had existed on the, supply side. Additionally, Figs. 7 l0 illstrnte a variation of the proximal guide and stop means and the elimination of the swinging flap which was illustrated in Figs. 1 6.DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Referring now to the drawings, a typical computer printer 1 is shown with the inlet web 2 feeding from the box B from the stack of fan folded paper on the supply sides of the printer. The folds as shown in Fig. 2 are designated by the letter F. As is well Know, the paper normally is perforated along its side, and is driven by a drive sprocket shown as D in the printing mechanism 1 although it is of course within the scope of this invention to utilize paper without the sprocket drive perforations. If a drive sprocket is not used, the paper is driven by pressure rollers according to conventional practice. The paper refolding apparatus itself consists of anL shaped refolding member 14 having a vertical back 5 with an inclined wall 6 and a base 7 which forms the refolding surface.The base has a proximal ledge 3 and there is a proximal planar surface 9 which extends from the bottom of base 7 to the proximal ledge 8. There is a proximal planar surface 9 which extends from the bottom of base 7 to the proximal ledge 8.An inclined proximal stop and guide means 10 extends from the proximal ledge 8 to the top of the cut away portion 11 of the vertical back 5. On either side of the cut away portion 11 are posts 12 containing pins 13 on which the curved guide means 14 is suspended. The curved guide means 14 has a receiving edge 15 which, as is shown in lig. 2 is j o5iLioflL d so as to receive the leading edge LE of the outlet web 3 of the printer 1 and is carried thraugh a curved path to the exiting edge 16. In the embodiment shown in Figs. 1 6, there is a cut away portion 18 at the exiting edge 16 of the curved guide means 14 for provision of a swinging flap 20 which is pivotably supported by a rod at point 21. This flap, however, is optional, and as shown in Figs. 7 10 is not utilized.Extending distally from the proximal ledge 8 to the distal end of the base 7 of the refolding apparatus is a planar surface 9 which serves as the refolding surface. This surface contains a spline 27 which extends from the proximal ledge 8 at an angle upwardly to the end of the base 7. A depending flange 29 is at the extreme distal end of the base and fits snugly over the end of the printer 1 and depending posts 30 are at the proximal end of the base fitting snugly over the inlet end of the printer 1. Alternately, base 7 can rest on the top surface of printer 1, or it can be equipped with sockets for legs to accommodate printers of various heights. Referring now to Figs. 2 6, it will be seen that the folded stack S of paper contained in the box B on the supply side of the printer is fed into the printer and is driven by the sprocket drive D through the exit so as to engage the receiving edge 15 of the curved guide member 14.It is, of course, well known in the art that the printing of the data takes place at the point B and that it is not necessary to use a sprocket drive, but that pressure rollers can be used without the perforated edges on the paper. The leading edge LE of the outlet web 3 is hand fed into the receiving edge 15 of the curved guide means 14 and exits at the exiting edge 16 where it is guided by the swinging flap 20 as is shown in Fig. 2. As is shown in Fig 3, the first foldFU, directed upwardly, and the leading edge LE is projected toward the distal end of the base 7 of the apparatus. Therefore, as is shown in FLg 4, the leading edge is manually mani u lated and pushed back against the stop 10 so that the fold FU will fall at the distal end of the base 7 on spline 27.Thereafter the next fold FD in which the fold is directed downwardly will fall by gravity against the guide means and stop 10 and from that point on, the operation is fully automatic.The purpose of the spline 27 is to allow the edges of the paper to bend over toward the edges of the planar surface 24 and allow the air between the folds to be squeezed out, so that the stack refolds itself in the same fold pattern as it had on the supply side S in the box B. In the event that the first fold exiting from the printer is disposed downwardly FD it is pushed proximally and downwardly so that FD then lies against the base of the fold and guide means 10 extends all the way across the back 5 of the L shaped member and the swinging flap has been climinated. With the fold FD against the stop and guide means 10, the leading edge LE is at the distal end of the base 7 on the spline 27 of the refolding apparatus and from that point on the operation is automatic in that the folds automatically assume the same pattern as had existed in the box B on the supply side S of the printer. The apparatus is small, compact and takes up very little space and has no moving parts. It is admirably suited for the personal computers and the personal terminals and printers used in the home and in the office, and does not require any more additional desk space than is required for the equipment per se. When the printing is finished, the printer should be manually operated to feed sufficient pages through to position the last printed page in the stack. Then the refolded stack can be sensrarod and all tho printed naves removed. It should be clear that it is possible with the apparatus of this invention to handle the full range of output of the printer, and also allow for the removal of some of the printed stack during the operation while the printing is taking place. Many modifications will occur to those skilled in the art from the description which has been herein above givenThis description is meant to be exemplary in nature and nonlimiting except so as to be commensurate in scope with the appended claims.
