## Description
DESCRIPTION COSMID VECTORS This invention relates to cosmid vectors and their use in the preparation of a gene bank. Many mammalian, including human, genes are known to have a size of over 20 kilo base pairs hereinafter designated as Kbp . Since the size of DNA which can be cloned in a conventionally used X phage is 20 Kbp, whole genes can not be cloned in a functional form in this way. However, DNA of a size of 35 45 Kbp can be cloned using a cosmid vector, a vector having a cohesive end site hereinafter designated as cos of X phage. Among the various types of vectors, it is by the use of cosmid vectors that the largest size of DNA can be cloned. However, the application of cosmid vectors has not been widespread due to the difficulty in preparing long genomic DNA fragments, a high background of vectors with no inserts and less effectiveness in preparation. Ish Horowicz and Burke have contrived to add directional qualities to cosmid vectors by utilising phosphatase, and succeeded in improving cloning efficiency as well as in reducing the background value of vectors with no insertsCD. Ish Horowicz and J.F. Burke, Nucleic Acids Res., 9, 2889 198171. The process for preparing a gene bank of genomic DNA according to the Ish Horowicz and Burke method can be illustrated as follows. A cosmid vector pJB 8, a conventional cosmid vector 5.44 Kbp in size having a restriction endonuclease BamHI, HindIII and Sail cleavage sites with oneX phage cos, is used. 1. pJB 8 is digested with HindIII to form linear DNA and the HindIII cleavage fragment is inactivated by treating with phosphatase. Cleavage with BamHI provides twoDNA fragments and the large fragment 5.4 Kbp containing cos is separated by means of agarose gel electrophoresis.The thus obtained DNA fragment 5.4 Kbp containing cos corresponds to a left arm of X phage. 2. pJB 8 is digested with SalI to prepare linear DNA and the SalI fragment is inactivated with phosphatase.Cleavage with BamHI provides two DN9 fragments and the small DNA fragment 2.34 kbp which contains cos is separated by means of agarose gel electrophoresis thereform.The thus obtained DNA fragment 2.34 Kbp containing cos corresponds to a right arm of X phage. 3. Human genomic DNA is partially digested with restriction endonuclease Sau3A or MboI to fractionate 35 40KbpDNA fragments. One such fragment is inserted between the left and right arms prepared in 1. and 2.by means of ligase T4 DNA ligase to prepare recombinant DNA. 4. The recombinant DNA is converted by means of in vitro packaging to transducing phage particles, which infectE. coli to prepare a human genomic DNA gene bank. The Ish Horowicz and Burke method has the following disadvantages First, the left and right arms must be prepared individually since pJB 8 has only one cos. Second, DNA fragments containing cos in the left and right arms must be separated individually by means of agarose gel electrophoresis. Third, since the length of pJB 8 left side is 5.4 Kbp and that of pJB 8 right side is 2.34 Kbp, i.e. different, the probablility of ligation on 35 45 Kbp genomic DNA is different and hence the ratio of the left and right arms should be carefully considered. Fourth, in the thus prepared gene bank, recombinantDNA can be replicated in E. coli cells as a plasmid and can be isolated as a covalently closed circular plasmidDNA ccc DNA from E. coli cells. However, a genomic DNA gene bank in the form of transducing phage particles can not be prepared from the said recombinant DNA. The present invention provides cosmid vectors having at least three cos of X phage or lambdoid phage in tandem.Thus, a cosmid vector of the invention comprises at least three cos. The cos are direct repeated sequence. Preferably, the cosmid vector contains a respective cleavage side for each of two restriction endonucleases such that,on digestion of the cosmid vector with the said restriction endonucleases, the cosmid vector is cleaved into left and right arms wherein one arm comprises at least one cos and the other arm comprises two cos. The right arm may therefore comprise at least one cos and the left arm comprise two cos. Preferably, the arms are of approximately equal length. A cosmid vector of the present invention may have three cos in tandem in a molecule. Digestion of the cosmid vector with two kinds of restriction endonuclease provides equimolar amounts of right and left arms of approximately equal length having one or two cos therein.Hence, individual preparation of the right and left arms is not required. Moreover, no agarose gel electrophoretic separation is necessary. Furthermore, since the length of the right and left arms is almost equal, ligation ratio in 35 45 Kbp genomic DNA by T4 DNA ligase is expected to be equal. Therefore, equimolar mixture of the right and left arms molecules kind of prepared by digestion with two restriction endonuclease, can directly be ligated with 35 45 Kbp genomic DNA to be expected converting half amount of recombinant DNA to transducing phage particles. Accordingly, using a vector of the present invention, 35 45 Kbp DNA fragment genomic DNA gene bank can simply and effectively be prepared.Further, since a vector of the present invention has three cos in tandem in a molecule, and hence a recombinant DNA thereof is converted to transducing phage particles by means of in vitro packaging to infect in E. coli, resulting recombinant DNA is replicated a plasmid DNA having two cos in E. coli. At this stage it is an extraneous DNA gene bank of a plasmid DNA, however in case that E. coli, in which A phage is lysogenized, is used as a host, lysogenized A phage enters lytic cycle by an induction such as heating or ultraviolet irradiation, thus components are expressedA phage in E. coli cells and finally E. coli is lysogenized to disperse out the A phage particles.Simultaneously, the recombinant DNA in the form of plasmid DNA having two cos in E. coli cells is introduced into a head of A phage, then transferred into transducing phage particles by means of in vitro packaging. According to the thus illu strata procedures, extraneous DNA gene bank as transducing pahge particles can be prepared. In a gene transformation of mammalian gene into cultured cells, a method using chromosome has advantages as compared with a method using plasmid DNA or genomic DNA as follows. 1 Effectiveness and frequency for DNA transformation are 10 to 100 times higher than as usual, and 2 Stable transformant clone can be obtained. Lewis, W.H.,Srinivasan, P.R., Stockoe, N. and Siminovitch, L., Somat.Cell. Genet., 6, 333 1980 . These facts may have correlations that DNA in chromosome is closely enveloped by chromation protein to construct chromatin structure, and so is defended from attacking by deoxyribonuclease DNase . Alternatively, constructing dense chromatin structure may have resulted easy incorporation into cells. However only chromosome itself in vitro can not be recombined the DNA and large amount of chromosome required for experimental use can not easily be prepared from cells. Referring to the structure of phage particles, DNA of A phage is enveloped densely with outer envelope protein, and this state resembles to chromosome DNA enveloped with protein. A method for preparing gene bank of A phage particles by recombinant DNA has been established. ishiura et al demonstrated transfer of HSV lTK gene n int Ltk cells using vector Chars 4A recombinant phage particles integrated with HSV lTK gene, and found that 1 Efficiency of gene integration is l0 5 and is higher at about one figure as compared with that of DNA itself, and is lower at one figure as compared with that of chromosome. and 2 Size of colony of transforming cell is larger than that obtained from DNA, and many of clones can be kept stable in non selective medium. Ishiura, M. et al., Mol. Cell. Biol., 2, 607 1982 . Substantial problem on gene bank prepared by Vector is that maximum size of DNA which can be cloned in vector is at maximum 20 Kbp, and hence if size of gene is larger ti a that, the said gene can not be cloned with functional form. in tandem A cosmid vector having three cos of the present invention has advantages that it can clone with 35 45 Kbp extraneous DNA and can preparegene bank with transducing phage particles. The present process can exhibit a great possibility for transforming gene in cultured cells. In Fig. 1, a novel cosmid vector of the present invention pTcos Apr ori cmr neor is illustrated. The pTcos Ap in tandem ori cmr neor consists of three cos which is are originated from cosmid vector pRH 44 or pLH 129 and has same direction Miwa and Matsubara, Gene, 20, 267 1982 , neomycin resistant gene neor originated from Tn903 Oka, Sugisaki and Takanami,J. Mol. Biol., 147, 217 1981 , chloramphenicol resistant gene cmr originated from pNT 31 Tomizawa and Itoh, Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci., U.S.A., 78, 6096 1981 , ampicillin resistant gene Apr originated from pBR 327 and origin of replication ori Soberon, Cavarrubias and Bolivar, Gene, 9, 287 1980 . Size of the said cosmid vector is 4.9 Kbp and is cleaved with restriction endonuclease Clal and BamHI at one point, respectively. A process for preparing gnomic DNA extraneous DNA bank using the said vector is illustrated as follows Fig. 2 . 1 A cosmid vector pTcos Apr ori cmr neor is cleaved with Clal to prepare linear DNA, then is treated with phosphatase to inactivate ClaI fragment. Further, the fragment is digested with BamHI to prepare right and left arms of the equal length having one or two cos, respectively. 2 Genomic DNA extraneous DNA is partially digested with Sau3A or MboI to prepare 35 45 Kbp DNA fragment. 3 Genomic DNA fragment 35 45 Kbp is inserted into between the left and right arms prepared in 1 hereinabove by means of T4 DNA ligase to prepare recombinantDNA. 4 The recombinant DNA is converted to transducing phage particles by means of in vitro packaging, which is infected into A phage lysogenic E. coli cells. 5 Since the said lysogenic DNA contains Apr, cmr and ori originated from vector, E. coli cells which include plasmid of recombinant DNA having two cos can be selectively grown by selection with ampicillin or chloramphenicol. 6 A transformant E. coli is subjected to induction such as heating or ultraviolet irradiation to transfer the lysogenic A phage into a lytic cycle, thereby the recombinantDNA having two cos can be converted to transducing phage pr ticles by means of in vivo packaging. The said transducing phage particles include the recombinant DNA comprising a cos, ori I ori and extraneous DNA. As illustrated, a genomic DNA extraneous DNA gene bank can be prepared as a transducing pahge particles. We have also prepared cosmid vector, pTcos Apr ori TK cmr neor which has specific marker for mammalian cells and yank is able to transfer the gene in mammalian cells Fig. 3 .The pTcos Apr ori TK cmr neor consists of three cos with identical direction originated from pRH 44 or pLH 129 , neor from Tn903, cm from pNT 31, Apr and ori from pBR 327 aYld TK gene from pTK 4. tishiura, M. et al., Mo. Cell. Biol.2, 607 1982 . Genomic gene bank can be prepared by the said cosmid vector as like the above mentioned pTcos Apr ori cmr neor. Namely, three cos in tandem is cleaved withClaI and BamHI to prepare equimolar amount of the right and left arms having one or two cos, respectively.The recombinant DNA can be prepared by inserting 35 45 Xbp genomic DNA in BamHI site thereof. The said recombinant DNA can be converted to transducing phage particles by means of in vitro packaging, then it can be transferred into E. coli cells, in which A phage is lysogenized, which can be selected by ampicillin or chloramphenicol treatment. Tj t e.resulted trnsformant E. coli is subjected to induction to transfer the recombinant DNA having two cos in transducing phage particles by means of in vivo packaging ,then the gene bank is prepared. Further since the said transducing phage particles have a marker gene TK , a judgment on tranfer of recombinant DNA originated from vector caX advantageously be made at a cultured ceil level, by checking a thymidine kinase TK activity at transferring a genomic gene bank cells to cultured cells The present invention is, therefore, the above illustrated novel cosmid vector and process for preparing a gene bank using the same. We have also prepared a cosmid vector, Fig. A . The pDcos cm consists of two cos in tandem originated from pRH 44 and pLH 129 , cmr from pNT 31, Apr and ori from pBR 322. The pDcos cmr was digested with two kinds of restriction endonuclease, BamHI, clal to right and left arms having one cos, respectively. The recombinant DNA can be prepared by inserting 35 45 kbp genomic DNA in BamHI site thereof. The said recombinantDNA can be converted to transducing phage particles by means of in vitro packing, then it canbe transferred into coli, which can be selected by ampicillin. At this stage it is an extraneous DNA gene bank of a plasmid DNA. Example of cos used in the present invention is orginated from A phage or lambdoid phage. The cos originated fromA phage is preferable. In order to prepare gene bank of transducing phage particles with cosmid vector of the present invention, it is sufficient to include three cos in tandem direction within a vector molecule, however the number of the cos more than three is not limited. A vector of the present invention is, at first, digested kinds of with two restriction endonucleases. Examples of a combination of the said restriction endonuclease are PvuII and BamHI,PvuII and II, ClaI and BamHI or ClaI and BglII. Other combinations thereof can be exist and are not limited. In order to check an insertion of DNA fragment originated from the vector , a selection by applying drug resistance can generally be performed.Therefore, vector of the present invention should preferably contain DNA fraqment which express druq resistance. Example of drug resistance is generally antibiotic resistance such as ampicillin resistance, tetracycline resistance, neomycin kanamycin resistance or chloramphenicol resistance. In pTcos Apr ori cmr neor and pTcos Ap ori TK cm neo ampicillin resistance gene, chlorampheniccl resistance gene and neomycin resistance gene exist therein. A pDcos c r h s ampicillin resistance gene, chloramphenicol resistance gene. Preparing a genomic DNA extraneous DNA gene bank using a vector of the present invention and transferring the gene into cultured mammalian cells, a DNA fragment, which express specific physiological function for determining an insertion of DNA fragment from the original vector, is preferably contained in the vector of the present invention.Examples of gene expressing specific physiological function are thymidine kinase TK gene Wigler, N., et al., Cell, 14, 725 1978 , adenine phosphoribosyltransferase APRT gene igler, N. et al., Proc.
