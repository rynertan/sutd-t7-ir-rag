# FUNCTION GENERATORS

## Abstract
A function generator for extracting the square root or other function of a pulse width modulated input signal utilizes a ROM table 12 which contains values of the inverse of the desired function. Two eight bit counters 26, 28 are clocked in proportion to the duty cycle of the input signal and the duty cycle of a flip flop 22 , which is related to the output of the ROM table 12 . The counters 26,28 keep a running average of the comparison of the foregoing duty cycles and, in turn, cause a four bit up down counter 30 and the ROM 12 to cycle in time between the value in the ROM 12 above and below the exact input value. In this manner, the output of a four bit up down counter 30 is an accurate interpolated representation of the square root of the input signal.
