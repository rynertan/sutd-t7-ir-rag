# Human hybrid cell lines, production and use thereof.

## Abstract
Inter alia a cell line characterised in that it is a substantially pure human myeloma derived cell line having the ATCC de signation CRL 8220 is disclosed, as are cell lines derived there from, for example by mutation or hybridization, such as CRL 8221. Such cell lines may be used in the production of mono clonal antibodies. The present invention provides advantages over the prior art.
