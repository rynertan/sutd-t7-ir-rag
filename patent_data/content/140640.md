## Abstract
There is described a water soluble compound having a molecular weight of from about 70,000 to about 2,000,000, and having the formula I, PS X HB Z where PS represents a physiologically acceptable polysaccha ride of molecular weight from about 2,000 to about 2,000,000, X represents a covalently bonded chemical bridging group, HB represents a haemoglobin residue, and Z represents an oxygen affinity reducing ligand, contain ing 2 or more phosphate groups. There is also described haemoglobin linked to an oxygen affinity reducing ligand derived from inositol phosphate, and polymers of such linked haemoglobin. Processes for making the compounds, and their formula tion and use as oxygen transporting agents, are also de scribed.
