## Description
Wheelchair lift This invention relates to loading mechanisms, and, more particularly, to lift devices suitable for loading handicapped persons with or without wheelchairs into vehicles such as busses or other types of public conveyances. It also relates to lift devices suitable for helping such persons in negotiating steps at the entran ce of, or within, a building.Life devices which in the past were designed for vehi cular use, were relatively bulky and cumbersome, taking up a great deal of space in the interior of such vehicles. It is clearly preferable to have the lift devices completely contained in the vehicles when such vehicles are in motion. However, the large size of the lift mechanisms has often necessitated external location of at least a portion of such equipment. The vehicle cargo capacity has often been greatly reduced by the portion of the lift mechanism located inside the vehicle.Furthermore, the size and complexity of such lift mechan isms often required that a special opening be cut into the side of the vehicle, in addition to the normal entrances, in order to accommodate the lifts.Lift mechanisms designed to help handicapped persons in negotiating steps at the entrance of, or within a building which have been provided up to the present time, have been relatively bulky and unsightly. These devices often interfere with the common use of the steps by normal people, and may require the opening of special doors or the installation of special ramps in addition to the normal entrances and stairways. The proposed lift device in its stowed position can act as the normal step structure and be completely hidden within it.The lift device according to the invention can be incorporated into any doorway entrance of vehicles suitable for either public or private conveyance. The lift in its stowed position forms the normal entrance steps, and, when required, can either be operated by the driver, without his moving from the driving position, or by the handicapped person himself from the entry location. The various step elements change into a platform which can be lowered, or raised, to any position between vehicle,floor height and ground level. The principal object of the invention is to provide a handicap lift which can be easily installed within the entry well of most conventional public transit vehicles. This object is achieved by replacing the normal entrance steps by a structure comprising load carrying platform made of four parallel sections.The sections are hinged together so that they can be folded into two steps in the stowed position. The supporting framework and lifting mechanism are conveniently installed along each side of the step well, and do not interfere with the use and operation of the vehicle. There is no need to provide for a platform storage space underneath the vehicle floor or within the vehicle itself. One of the platform sections comprises two telescopic elements and can be expanded to provide a wider load carrying platform. The fourth element along the forward edge of the platform can be tilted to act as an access ramp for a wheelchair.It can also be flipped upward to act as an angle stop preventing the wheelchair from rolling off the platform during lifting. The present invention may also be installed within other types of step structures, such as those found in split level homes, at the entrance of a building or as part of a loading dock.Other purposes and advantages of the invention will appear more clearly from the following detailed description made with reference to the appended drawings given solely by way of example and wherein Figure 1 is a perspective view showing the inven tion installed in the entrance of a public tran sportation vehicle in the deployed position fi gure 2 is a schematic of the electrical system figure 3 is a perspective view of the supporting structure and lift mechanism in the deployed posi tion figure 4 is a affront elevational view of the lift carriage figure 5 is a top view of the lift carriage, showing the deployed platform figure 6 is a side sectional view taken along the line 6 6 of figure 3 figure 7 is a sectional view similar to figure 6, but showing the platform in the stowed, step forming position figure 8 is an exploded, perspective view of the explandable section.Ref erring now to the drawing, as an example of one embodiment of this invention, there is shown a wheelchair lift device mounted within the doorway of a public transportation vehicle.In figure 6 the lift is deployed in its lower position.It should be noted that the surface of the load carrying platform 10 is formed by the level section 1 of step B which is normally the closest to the vehicle floor in the stowed position and the level Section 3 of step A, which had been extended outward, the joint raiser section 2 between steps A and B which has been laid down flat , and the raiser section 4 below step A. The four sections 1, 2, 3, and 4 are articulated by being hinged together along their edges 5, 6, and 7. In order to return the lift to the stowed position the level section 3 on step A is withdrawn and the raiser section 2 is raised to a vertical position so that the level surfaces 1 and 2 are placed on two different levels forming the entrance steps.The lower raiser section 4, as shown in figure 6 can be rotated to form a sloping access ramp to the load carrying platform 10. It can also be flipped upward as shown in broken lines in order to prevent a load such as a wheelchair from rolling backçards during motion of the platform 10. Preferring now to figure 3, the lift device comprises two pairs of horizontal girders 11 and 12 welded to the frame 13 of the vehicle V, and located at opposite sides of the doorway. Girders 11 support two vertical cylindrical rods 14 which are capped at their upper end by the horizontal section of L shaped stanchions 16.Girders 12 are preferably anchored to the wall of the vehicle at ends 18. Stanchions 16 are anchored to the wall of the vehicle at their upper ends and to beam 13 of the vehicle at their lower ends. The vertical cylindrical rods 14 and 15 hereinafter referred to as lifting guides , girders 11 and 12 and stanchions 16 form the supporting framework of the lift device and its stationary components.The moving components of the lift device comprising the articulated platform sections 1, 2, 3, and 4 and associated means to form the lift platform, are mounted on a generally U shaped carriage 32 designed to ride vertically along and between the two pairs of lifting guides 14 and 15. As more specifically shown in figures 4 and 5, this carriage comprises a base formed by 2 iron beams 23 linked by a rectangular skid plate 24 flanked by two lateral elements extending upward from the base.Each lateral element is formed by vertical members 25 and 26 fastened to beam 23, and crossmembers 27 and 28.Each lateral element is slidingly connected to lifting guides 14 at its upper end through bracket 31 at midsection through bracket 29, and to lifting guide 15 through brace 30.Pairs of pulley shaped rollers 35 and 39, and 37 having grooved rims matching the convexity of cylindrical guides 14 and 15, are mounted within bracket 31, 29 and brace 30 respectively capturing said guides and providing a smooth and stable movement of carriage 32 vertically along and between them. Two hydraulic cylinders 19 are connected at their upper closed ends to the horizontal sections of stanchions 16 by pin 20. Pistons moving within these cylinders under hydraulic fluid pressure are connected at their outer ends through rod 21 to beams 23 by means of pin 22 thus providing means for lifting carriage 32 along and between the lifting guides 14 and 15.The level section 1 of step B is seen riding between vertical members 25 and 26 which act as vertical guides during its collapsing motion.Two hydraulic cylinders 36 are connected at their upper closed ends to cross members 27. Pistons moving within these cylinders under hydraulic fluid pressure are connected at their outer ends through rods 25 to opposite ends of level section 1 thus providing means for vertically moving step B along and between members 15 and 26.Since the lift is designed to be installed in the front right entrance well of a public vehicle, and in order not to obstruct the driver s field of vision, the right side supporting elements 11, 12, and 16 are mounted on a lower level than their opposite left side elements.The carriage right lateral element is also shorter than the left lateral element. Bracket 8 and 9 are used to compensate for the difference in height and to hold hydraulic cylinders 19 and 36 respectively at levels sufficient to yield the required lifting action.The level section 3 of step A is fastened to element 59 of slide assemblies associated with beams 23. Each slide assembly is made of three telescopic elements 58, 59 and 60. These types of Atandard slide assemblies well known to persons skilled in the mechanical arts are used in a variety of commercial and industrial applications to provide a low friction slidable coupling between mechanical structures. These slides are commercially available under various trade names and generally comprise an outer member channels capturing an inner member between rows of ball bearings.Elements 58 of the slides are slidingly connected to the inside lateral surface of beams 23. Elements 59 are slidingly connected to elements 58 and support level section 3 of the platform. Elements 60 are connected to elements 59, are tapered down toward the front of the platform, and are designed to support the raiser section 4.The two elements 60 are cross connected by an end beam 56 .A pressure sensitive sensor 57 runs along end beam 56. The raiser section 2 of step B comprises two telescopic interconnecting flat elements 41 and 43. The upper element 41 is hingedly connected along its upper edge to level section 1 of step B. The lower element 43 is hingedly connected along its lower edge to level element 3 of step A. Their opposing edges are crenelated in order to form interlocking patterns as shown in figure 8. The lower element 43 is sandwiched between the step surface plate 42 and the supporting plate 44.The upper element 41 telescopically and partially engages into the sheath thus constituted. A step surface cover 40 having overlapping edges 49 is fastened to the upper element 41. The overlapping edges are bent under the cover to provide a sliding space for the other surface plate 42.The two elements 41 and 43 are resiliently kept to their minimum common width by a pair of coil springs 45 and 46.Attached to lower element 43 by pins 47 and to upper element 41 by pins 48.When the platform is in the stowed position, as illustrated in figure 7, the raiser section 2 is allowed to shrink to its minimum width under the pull of the coil springs 45 and 46.When the platform is fully deployed, as illustrated in figures 3 and 6, the raiser section 2 is expanded to its maximum width in order to provide additional load carrying surface.Two hydraulic cylinders 52 and 53 mounted back to back have their piston rods 51 and 54 extending in opposite directions. The end of rod 51 is connected to a bracket 50 in the lower back corner of the carriage 32. The end of rod 54 is extending into a smaller diameter rod 55. Rod 55 passes through a hole in the center of bracket 64 associated with level section 3 of step A, and is connected to the end beam 56.When rods 51 and 54 are extended under fluid pressure the end beam 56 is first pushed forward, causing the raiser section 4 of step A to rotate upward around hinge 7 until it forms an access ramp to the load carrying platform 10 as illustrated in figure 6.At this point rod 54 comes in contact with bracket 64, and begins to push level section 3 of step A forward.This forward motion is coordinated with a downward motion of level section 1 of step B under the action of hydraulic cylinders 36.As the hydraulic cylinder rods 52 and 54 continue their outward movement the expandable raiser section 2 of step B is stretched to its maximum elongation between level sections 1 and 3.When the platform 10 has been loaded with a wheelchair, the raiser section 4 of step A can be flipped upward under the action of level 62 associated with hydraulic cylinder 61 in order to provide an angle stop for the wheelchair.The pressure sensor mounted along the outer edge of end beam 56 is made of flexible material. Any pressure applied to the sensor upon contact with any object is transmitted through its fluid to a pressure switch, which is part of electrical safety control system.Grooved plastic or rubber mats are preferably used to cover the steps and ramp surfaces for safety purposes.The means for operating the hydraulic cylinders, such as those used in this invention, are well known to people skilled in the mechanical arts, and comprise a source of pressurized fluid, such as a pump, and various conduits for feeding the pressurized fluid to manually of solenoid controlled valves. The valves, in turn, direct the flow of pressurized fluid into the cylinders on either sides of the pistons, so as to control the movement and direction of the pistons within the cylinders. Solenoid controlled valves also having manual lever control are preferably used in the present invention, and in combination with the cylinders and associated means, constitute the electro hydraulic powered means to operate the lift. Referring now to figure 2, in addition to the other drawings, I shall describe the operation of the lift device.The lifting motion of cylinders 19 fig. 3 is controlled by valve solenoid 138 the lowering action being controlled by valve solenoid 139.The outward deploying motion of cylinders 53 and 54 fig.6 is controlled by valve solenoid 115 the inward retracting action by valve solenoid 116.The step lowering motion of cylinder 36 fig. 4 is controlled by valve solenoid 114, and the step raising motion by valve solenoid 117.The electrical power supply comprises the vehicle battery 100 protected by circuit breakers 101 and 102.Manual switches 150, 151, 152, and 153 are accessible from the driver s seat or from the entrance area of the vehicle, and allow the driver or the lift user to control the operation of the lift. Switches 150, 151, and 152 are preferably of a momentary type which return to the off position when released.A three position switch 150 controls the position of the common 140, and is used to raise or lower the carriage 32. A three position switch 151 controls the position of the common 119, and is used to deploy or retract the platform 10. A three position switch 152 controls the position of common 109, and is used to raise or lower the wheel chair angle stop 4. A two position switch 153 controls commons 130 and 131, and is used to return the lift to its stowed location.While the switch 153 is in the NORMAL position, holding switch 150 to the DOWN position energized the valve solenoid 139 through switch 131, 127, 128, and 104. Cóil 103 of the pump control solenoid switch 145 is energized and the pump 143 is started, causing the lowering of the carriage 32 by cylinders 19.Holding switch 150 in the UP position energized the valve solenoid 138 through switches 130, 129, and 104. The pump 143 is similarly started and the platform 10 is deployed by extending step section 3 under action of cylinders 52, and 53, while step section 1 is lowered under simultaneous action of cylinders 36.Holding the switch 151 in the IN position energized the valve solenoids 116 and 117 through switches 118, 123, and 104. The pump 143 is similarly started, and the step section 3 is retracted under action of the cylinders 52 and 53, while the step section 1 is raised under simultaneous action of the cylinders 36. While the switch 152 is held in the LOCK position, valve solenoid 108 of hydraulic cylinder 61 is activated through switches 109, and 106. The lever 62 pivots around pin 63, thus causing section 4 to rotate upward around hinge 7.While the switch 152 is held in the UNLOCK position, the action of hydraulic cylinder 61 is inverted by valve solenoid 107 through switches 109 and 106 causing section 4 to return toward its DOWN position.The various mechanical motions just described are further controlled through the following switch means. In most public transit vehicles, the door tpatng mechanism is interlocked with the braking system in order to prevent accidental opening of the vehicle while it is in motion.Therefore, in order to block the operation of the lift device while the doors are closed or the vehicle is moving, the electric power supply is run through a pole of the vehicle door interlock switch, which close contact 104 only when the door is fully open.A down limit switch actuated when rods 21 fig.3 reach the maximum extension opens switch 128 thus stopping pump 143. An up limit switch, actuated when the plat form 10 reaches the level of the vehicle floor F opens switch 129 in order to stop further lifting action of platform 10. An outward limit switch actuated when the platform 10 is fully deployed, opens switch 122 stopping the deployment operation. An inward limit switch, actuated when the platform 10 is fully retracted opens switch 123 in order to stop fur ther retraction of the platform 10. A mat type contact switch, located under the skid plate 24, and actuated whenever the platform touches ground or an obstacle, closes switch 125, energizing the coil of obstruction relay 126, causing switch 127 to open. This interrupts further downward motion of the platform 10.A stop down limit switch actuated when the wheel chair angle stop 4 is down closes switch 118 in order to allow retraction of section 3 only when the angle stop 7 is loweredA ramp out limit switch actuated when the ramp is fully extended closes switch 106 in order to prevent raising the angle stop 4 while the section 3 is retracted.A stowed position switch actuated when the carriage 10 reaches its normal step position opens switches 136 and 137, stopping further upward or downward motion of the carriage when switch 153 is in the STOW position.A pressure switch located along the end beam 56 and actuated whenever the ramp hits an obstacle, closes switch 105, energizing the coil of relay 112, thus opening switch 113, and preventing any further extension of the platform 10. The standard sequence of operation is generally as follows. After opening the door D of the vehicle V, hand flipping switch 153 to the NORMAL position, the driver holds switch 150 in the DOWN position until the carriage 32 touches ground. After releasing switch 150, he holds switch 151 in the OUT position until the platform 10 is fully deployed. After the loading of the wheel chair onto the platform 10 the angle stop 4 is raised by holding switch 152 in the LOCK position for a short while.The platform 10 is raised to the level of the vehicle floor F by holding the switch 150 in the UP position.After entry of the wheel chair into the vehicle, switch 153 is returned to the STOW position. The angle stop 4 is lowered by holding switch 152 in the UNLOCK position. The carriage 32 is lowered to the stow away level by holding switch 150 to the DOWN position and the platform 10 is retracted into the stowed step position by next holding the switch 151 on the IN position. The sequence of operation may be appropriately reversed to lower a wheel chair from the vehicle floor to the ground. The carriage 32 may also be lowered or raised without unfolding the steps A and B into a platform. A lever 44 is mounted on pump 143, along with manual control of the valves, to operate the lift device in case of electric power failure. The pump itself is preferably located near the entrance and or control switches.While I have described one embodiment of the present invention, many variations may be suggested without departing from the scope of the invention. For instance, an electro electric mqtor means could be used to control the operation of the wheelchair stop flap in place of the mechanism described here.It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that other variations may be made in the details of construction and application without departing from the spirit and scope of this invention as defined in the following claims.
