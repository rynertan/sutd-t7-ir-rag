# Numerical control system.

## Abstract
A numerical control system 100 includes a translator which translates supplied control data written in a high level language into a machine language program and generates machining class and machining data corresponding to machining step of machine tool 200 based on the control data, and a movement data storing part storing machining data which is transferred in the sequence of machining steps to the address location corresponding to the machining class for each end of one machining step are provided. The machine tool 200 is controlled by the machine tool control data which are generated by judging a machining class from an address storing movement data in the movement data storing part and referring to a movement data stored in the movement data.
