# Method of manufacturing sintered ceramic body.

## Abstract
A method of manufacturing a sintered ceramic body which has a conductive layer and which is suitable for bond ing with a metal member, has the steps of coating at least part of a surface of an unsintered ceramic powder compact with a coating material which has a melting point or decomposition point higher than a sintering temperature of the compact and which is selected from the group consisting of a metal, a metal salt, a conductive inorganic material and a nonconductive inorganic material which becomes conductive after sintering, and sintering a resultant structure, thus forming the sintered ceramic body having a conductive layer on at least part of the surface thereof.
