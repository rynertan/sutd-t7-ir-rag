## Description
This invention is directed to novel compounds having anti diabetic activity. Each compound of this invention is available by conversion of human proinsulin or an intermediate derived from human proinsulin. Human proinsulin is recognized to exhibit anti diabetic activity, albeit at a much lower level, relative to human insulin itself. The compounds of this invention exhibit anti diabetic activity at a level much greater than that demonstrated by human proinsulin. According to the present invention there is provided a compound having the formula I in which X is present or absent, and, if present, is A L E G S L Q or A L E G S L Q K R This invention is directed to three peptides, any of which may be in the form of its pharmaceutically acceptable salt. The peptide sequences and corresponding short hand descriptions used herein in which the term HPI denotes human proinsulin are as follows Included in the compounds of this invention are their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts and their pharmaceutically acceptable carboxylic acid salts. The term pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts encompasses both organic and inorganic acid addition salts including, for example, those prepared from acids such as hydrochloric, sulfuric, sulfonic, tartaric, fumaric, hydrobromic, glycolic, citric, maleic, phosphoric, succinic, acetic, nitric, benzoic, ascorbic, p toluenesulfonic, benzenesulfonic, naphthalenesulfonic, propionic, carbonic, and the like, or salts, such as, for example, ammonium bicarbonate. Preferably, the acid addition salts are those prepared from hydrochloric acid, acetic acid, or carbonic acid. Any of the above salts can be prepared by conventional methods. The term carboxylic acid salts includes, for example, zinc, ammonium, alkali metal salts such as sodium, potassium, and lithium, and the like. Preferred carboxylic acid salts are the zinc and sodium salts. For the sake of convenience, the amino acids of the peptides referred to herein are described by their approved single letter shorthand designations. These designations are as follows The compounds of this invention can be prepared by routine peptide synthesis methods. Alternatively, and preferably, the compounds of this invention can be prepared from human proinsulin. Human proinsulin is available via a variety of routes, including organic synthesis, isolation from human pancreas by conventional methodology, and, more recently, recombinant DNA methodology. In broad outline, the production of proinsulin using recombinant DNA methodology involves obtaining, whether by isolation, construction, or a combination of both, a sequence of DNA coding for the amino acid sequence of human proinsulin. The DNA coding for human proinsulin then is inserted in reading phase into a suitable cloning and expression vehicle. The vehicle is used to transform a suitable microorganism after which the transformed microorganism is subjected to fermentation conditions leading to a the production of additional copies of the human proinsulin gene containing vector and b the expression of human proinsulin or a human proinsulin precursor product. In the event the expression product is a human proinsulin precursor, it generally will comprise the human proinsulin amino acid sequence joined at its amino terminal to another protein, whether foreign or that normally expressed by the gene sequence into which the human proinsulin gene has been inserted. The human proinsulin amino acid sequence is joined to the protein fragment through a specifically cleavable site, typically methionine. This product is customarily referred to as a fused gene product. The human proinsulin amino acid sequence is cleaved from the fused gene product using cyanogen bromide after which the cysteine sulfhydryl moieties of the human proinsulin amino acid sequence are stabilized by conversion to their corresponding S sulfonates. The resulting human proinsulin S sulfonate is purified, and the purified human proinsulin S sulfonate then is converted to human proinsulin by formation of the three properly located disulfide bonds, using, for example, the method of U.S. Patent No. 4,430,266. The resulting human proinsulin product then is purified using recognized methodology. The compounds of this invention can be prepared by enzymatic digestion of human proinsulin. Thus, treatment of human proinsulin with trypsin leads to the production of, among others, 65 A1 split HPI. Treatment of the product mixture by gel filtration followed by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography HPLC permits recovery of purified 65 A1 split HPI. The 65 A1 split HPI is used to prepare the other compounds of this invention. Thus, treatment of 65 A1 split HPI with carboxypeptidase B yields des 64,65 HPI. Similarly, treatment of 65 A1 split HPI with chymotrypsin yields des 57 65 HPI. As noted, the compounds of this invention have an insulin like, anti diabetic effect substantially greater than that recognized for human proinsulin. The compounds of this invention, due to their insulin like activity, are useful in the treatment of diabetes. As such, they can be used in a variety of pharmaceutical compositions and formulations and can be administered by a variety of conventional routes, such as intramuscular, intravenous, subcutaneous, and intraperitoneal. In administering the compounds of this invention, the pharmaceutical forms suitable for injection include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the compounds of this invention in the calculated amount of the appropriate solvent along with various of the other ingredients, as desired. The following examples are provided to illustrate this invention. They are not intended to be limiting on the scope thereof.
