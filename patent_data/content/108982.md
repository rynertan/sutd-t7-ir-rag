# CASSETTE FOR STIMULABLE PHOSPHOR SHEET

## Abstract
A cassette for removably housing a stimulable phos phor sheet for storing a radiation image therein comprises a flat box like front plate and a cover member openably coupled with the front plate. A piled material or a foamed material is secured to the inner surface of the front plate, and a resilient layer is secured to the inner surface of the cover member, thereby protecting the stimulable phosphor sheet housed in the cassette.
