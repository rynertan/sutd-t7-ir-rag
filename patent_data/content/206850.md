## Description
SOFT COOKIES HAVING BLOOM RESISTANCE This invention relates to methods for producing bloom resistant cookies having a soft texture throughout the cookie. This invention also relates to cookie dough compositions for producing the cookies. Cookies with a moisture content above about 6 by weight are usuaily soft and cohesive. To produce cookies which retain enough moisture to be classified as soft, numerous humectants have been used. Exemplary thereof are raisins, raisin pastes, high fructose corn syrup, corn syrup, glycerine, and mixtures thereof. Without the use of such humectants, cookie doughs which contain sufficient water to compensate for volatilization during baking 7r do not exhibit sufficient cohesiveness for forming into pieces on conventional commercials scale cookie forming equipment, 2 exhibit raw flavor or color qualities, and 3 most importantly, lose their soft texture within a week or within a few days even when properly packaged in air tight packaging.Generally, increasing the humectant content of the cookie dough extends the textural stability of soft cookies. Liquid humectants such as high fructose com syrup, corn syrup, glycerin and molasses are readily dispersed through a dough for providing a homogenously soft texture to the cookies. However, it has been found that soft cookies which contain chocolate chips tend to exhibit bloom on the flavor chips under storage conditions. Bloom appears as a whitish deposit, either in the form of discrete particles or a continous layer, which covers at least part of the surface of the flavor chip.Bloom may be caused by the formation of fat and or sugar crystals on the surface of the chips.While bloom may occur on flavor chips other than chocolate chips, it is particularly apparent in dark chips. The whitish deposits are even more apparent in dark cookies, such as chocolate fudge cookies. Although bloom does not pose any health risk, it is aesthetically unappealing and may lead consumers to the conclusion that the whitish deposits are due to moid growth or rancidity, or that the product lacks freshness or richness. It is believed that migration of water in soft cookies from the crumb position to the flavor chip surface dissolves sugar in the chip. Recrystallization of the sugar, caused by a drop in temperature, results in the formation of sugar crystals which are visible as sugar bloom . Sugar crystals or other non fat solids on the flavor chip surface may also serve as nucleation sites for recrystallization of fat crystals. The fat which recrystallizes may have originated in the flavor chip or the shortening or fat used in forming the dough.It is believed that the fat components having a higher melting point serve as nucleation sites for the outer fat components because upon cooling, the higher components reach their solidification temperature first Additionally, the higher melting point components, particular those which solidify at temperatures above normally encountered cookie storage temperatures, have less time to crystallize. The more rapid crystallization results in an unstable crystal form which cannot transform into a stable form. In producing soft cookies, the use of a shortening or fat which is completely liquid at normal cookie storage temperatures of less than about 100 F, may result in excessive oven spread and or oil seepage to the surface of the cookie. Undesireable puddles of liquid fat or greasiness tends to smear packaging material, develop rancidity, and causes annoyance upon handling of the product The present invention provides shelf stable cookies having a moist, cake like soft textured crumb structure over an extended period of time which exhibit resistance to fat and sugar bloom on flavor chips. Even though a shortening or fat which contains low proportions of solid fats at cookie storage temperatures is used to prevent bloom, the cookies do not exhibit excessive oven spread or seepage of liquid oil at those temperatures. The present invention provides shelf stable cookies having a moist, cake like soft textured crumb structure over an extended period of time which are fat and sugar bloom resistant A shortening or fat having a solid fat index of less than 13 at 80 F 26.7 C and which is essentially completely liquid at about 100 F or below, is used to prevent bloom on flavor chips. The shortening or fat is used in amounts which promote a moist, soft texture in the cookie. A flavoring ingredient which reduces mobility of the shortening or fat in the cookie controis excessive oven spread and prevents undesirable oil seepage from the cookie to packaging materials. In the present invention a shortening or fat having a solid fat index of less than 13 at 800F 26.7 C and which is essentially completely liquid at about 100 F or below is used to prevent sugar and or fat bloom on flavor chips in shelf stable moist, soft cookies. The cookies retain a moist, cake like soft textured crumb structure for extended periods of time when properly packaged. It is believed that the low melting shortening or fat coats the flavor chip particles during mixing, and baking and post baking cooling. Water, which im parts a moist, soft texture, is repelled from the surface of the flavor chips. This, it is believed, prevents dissolution of sugar in the chips and sub sequent recrystallization of the sugar on the chip surface thereby avoiding sugar bloom and nucleation sites for fat crystals.Sugar crystals which may form, or other non fat components which may serve as nucleation sites, may be washed off the flavor chip particles by the liquid shortening or fat. Furthermore, as the proportion of components which melt at lower temperatures is increased in a shortening or fat, it is less likeiy that fat crystallization, particularly undesirable fat crystallization, will occur at cookie storage temperatures. Upon cooling of the cookie after baking to normal cookie storage temperatures, the fat components will remain liquid or will have more time to crystallize into a stable form. The shortening or fat, or oil, can be made from vegetable oils such as soybean oil, sunflower oil, palm oil, safflower oil, corn oil, and blends thereof.A typical shortening or fat for use in the present invention is a blend of soybean oil and palm oil, each of which is refined, bleached, partially hydrogenated, and deodorized, with the soybean oil being from about 45 by weight to about 55 by weight of the mixture. It suitably has a solid fat index of from about 18 to about 31 at 50 F 10 C , and a solid fat index of from about 7 to about 11 at 80 F 26.7 C . The oils are preferably stabilized with antioxidant, such as tertiarybutylhydroquinone TBHQ , and contain citric acid as a chelating agent. Partially hydrogenated vegetables oils suitable for use in the present invention are readily available commercially. The shortening or fat, or oil, is used in an amount which is sufficient to promote a soft textured crumb structure. Typical amounts range from about 20 by weight to about 80 by weight, preferably from about 35 by weight to about 65 by weight, based upon the weight of the flour. Excessive oven spread due to the presence of liquid humectants, water, and the high leveis of iiquified shortening or fat, or oil, is controlled by a flavoring ingredient which reduces the mobility of the shortening or fat in the cookie. Reduction in the mobility of the shortening or fat, or oil, prevents seepage of it to the packaging materials. Reduction in mobility may be caused by slurry formation, absorption of the liquid oil, solubilization in the liquid oil so as to increase its viscosity, binding with proteins, or a combination thereof. Interaction of the flavoring ingredient and the liquid shortening or fat, or oil, is also believed to enhance flavor and a moist mouthfeel upon eating of the cookie. Liquid fat components provide an impression of moistness and serve as a carrier for flavor components, particularly upon a reduction in viscosity as they reach body temperatures. Exemplary of flavoring ingredients which may be used to inhibit shortening or fat, or oil migration in the soft cookies are cocoa, Dutched cocoa, carob powder, and mixtures thereof. A suitable amount of the flavoring ingredient ranges from about 10 by weight to about 45 by weight of the shortening or fat. The flavoring ingredient is prefereably in powdered form, for greater absorbability, suspendability or solubility. It should be lipophilic so as to inhibit shortening or oil migration preferentially over migration of water in the cookie. The term flavor chips is used herein to denote any particles comprising fat and sugar added to cookies for flavoring purposes which remain as discrete, visually apparent inclusions in the baked cookie, and which may render the cookie susceptible to bloom effects. Thus, the term includes, chocolate chips, bufterscotch chips, caramel chips, and mixtures thereof. Chocolate chips generally pose the greater bloom problems because of their dark color. Typical amounts used range from about 35 by weight to about 90 by weight of the flour. Suitable flavor chips have a count per pound of from about 4000 to about 6000. The humectant used in the cookies should absorb and bind or hold water so as to impart a shelf stable softness. The binding should be such that the equilibrium rate of moisture loss from the baked product to the environment due to the presence of the humectant is slowed to such a degree that a baked product containing the humectant, and having an initial moisture content of at least about 6 by weight, exclusive of inclusions retains a moist, soft and pliable cake like texture, for at least about two months, and preferably for at least about 6 12 months when the cookie is stored in a closed container. Humectant sugars may be employed alone or in combination with other sugars in the cookie dough to impart a soft texture. Suitable humectant sugars include fructose, lactose, dextrose, corn syrups, invert syrups, high fructose corn syrups, honey, molasses, raisin paste, as well as mixtures of one or more of the foregoing humectants. For example, a suitable humectant sugar composition for use in the cookie dough may comprise about 0 to 85 percent sucrose, with the balance of the sugar being comprised of fructose employed in the form of crystallized sugar. Alternatively, the balance of the sugar may be provided by the sugar solids content of a corn syrup, honey or a high fructose corn syrup, or another humectant sugar. Commerically available high fructose corn syrups are preferred humectants. They are low in cost, are highly humectant, provide a pleasant sweet taste, and are readily commercially available.They are prepared by the enzymatic isomerization of dextrose containing corn syrups, and typically possess a sugar solids component of about 40 percent to about 100 percent by weight fructose, with the balance of the non fructose sugar solids being primarily dextrose plus minor amounts of other monosaccharides. The sugar solids content of commercially available high fructose corn syrups typically ranges from about 70 percent to about 73 percent, up to about 82 percent by weight. High fructose corn syrups having at least about 80 by weight of their solids as fructose are most preferred. Examples of other humectant sugars include maltose, sorbose, mannose, and galactose.When sucrose is employed in the cookie dough, the humectant sugar should comprise at least about 15 percent, and preferably at least about 20 percent, by weight of the total sugar solids content of the cookie dough. In addition to the humectant sugars, humectants, or aqueous solutions of humectants which are not sugars or possess a low degree of sweetness relative to sucrose may also be employed in the cookie dough. For example, the use of glycerol, sugar alcohols such as mannitol, maltitol, xylitol and sorbitol, and other polyols, as humectants is well known in the art. Additional examples of humectant polyols i.e. polyhydric alcohols include humectant glycols, for example propylene glycol and hydrogenated glucose syrups. Other humectants include sugar esters, dextrins, and other starch hydrolysis products. However, the humectant sugars are preferred because of their sweetness. The humectant may be included in the dough as an added ingredient, or an enzyme may be included in the dough formulation which acts on a substrate also included in the dough during, before or after baking, to produce effective amounts of the humectant in situ in the dough. Example of suitable enzymes for the purpose include invertase which effects the inversion of sucrose to invert sugar, as well as other glycosidases and polysaccharidases which after acting on carbohydrates present in the dough produce humectants as the by products of their enzymatic activity. Enzymes suitable for use in this manner include polysaccharidases which act upon farinaceous materials to produce lower molecular weight saccharides such as glucose, maltose, modified starches, dextrins, etc. Enzymes of this type include alpha and beta amylases. Alpha amylases, such as those obtained from bacterial sources Bacillus subtilisor B. mesintericus are known to be heat stable, and have been reported to be able to retain some activity at temperatures as high as 100 C. The number of SKB units of amylase enzyme per 100 grams of flour will typically be about 6 to 1000 units. Pregelatinized starch may be added to the dough to produce a readily available substrate for the enzyme. SKB units may be assayed by the method of Sandstetde, Kneen andBlish, described in Cereal Chemistry, 16 712 1939 .Amylase enzymes are commercially available, and include Fresh N, a product of G. B.Fermentation Industries Inc, Charlotte, North Carolina as well as Termanyl and Bacterial AmylaseNovo Ban which are products of Novo Industry A S, Novo Alle, DK 2880, Bagsvaerd, Denmark. Edibie humectant gels such as a humectant sucrose gel and or a high fructose corn syrup gel can be used in the cookie dough for achieving a soft and chewy texture which is stable for prolonged periods. Preparation of the gels and of doughs containing them for producing soft edible baked products having extended shelf life is taught in U.S. patent number 4,444,799 and commonly assigned pending U.S. application Serial No.712,206, filed March 15, 1985, which is a continuation of U.S. application Serial No. 580,365, filedFebruary 16, 1984, which in turn is a continuationin part of the application which issued as U.S.patent number 4,444,799. The aforementioned patent is herein incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In accordance with the teachings of U.S. Application No. 712,206, a firm gel, capable of being ground is obtained by admixing a from about 0.25 parts by weight to about 4.0 parts by weight, preferably from about 0.5 parts by weight to about 1.5 parts by weight of an edible gum capable of being sent by calcium ions, and b from about 0.1 parts by weight to about 4 parts by weight, preferably from about 0.25 parts by weight to about 1.0 parts by weight of a calcium ion source, said parts being based upon 100 parts by weight of the edible viscous liquid. The ingredients are admixed under high shear mixing conditions which assures an at least substantially lump free and homogeneous gel. The edible firm, elastic or rubbery gel is ground into pieces typically at temperatures of from about 65 F to about 850 F. The ground gel is incorporated into a dough using conventional mixing techniques known in the bakery art. The ground gel which is incorporated into the dough is not discernible as pieces in the baked good upon consumption. The amount of water used to produce the gels generally ranges from about 15 by weight to about 35 by weight, based upon the total weight of the gel. A humectant gel for use in the present invention can be prepared by using sucrose syrup and or high fructose corn syrup as the edible viscous liquid, sodium alginate as the edible gum, and food grade calcium sulfate dihydrate as the calcium ion source. Other gums which may be employed include potassium alginate, ammonium alginate, carrageenan, guar gum, locust bean gum, starch, protein, Xanthan gum, mixtures thereof, and the like. Other calcium ion sources which may be employed include food grade monocalcium phosphate anhydrous, calcium sulfate, calcium carbonate, calcium lactate, calcium monohydrogen phosphate, dicalcium orthophosphate dihydrate, tricalcium phosphate, calcium chloride, mixtures thereof, and the like. Weight ratios of sodium alginate edible calcium ion source in the range of about 1 to 3 are generally used.Propylene glycol and glycerine may be used as dispersing agents for the calcium source or the sodium alginate. In the dough bakeable to a cake like moist, soft textured crumb structure, on the basis of 100 pounds of the flour component of the dough, the humectant plus any sucrose or other sweetener employed e.g. artificial sweeteners in the formulation may be present in amounts ranging from about 25 to about 150 pounds depending on the degree of sweetness and humectant properties desired in the baked product. Typical amounts of high fructose corn syrup for use in the present invention range from about 10 by weight to about 50 by weight, based upon the weight of the flour. It may be in liquid form and or in a humectant gel. Typical amounts of sucrose for use herein range from about 35 to about 60 by weight, based upon the weight of the flour. Typically, the total sugar solids content exclusive of inciusions of the dough is from about 50 to about 110 pounds of sugar per 100 pounds of the flour component. The flour employed in the cookie doughs is selected from conventional ingredient lines. The flour component may be any comminuted cereal grain or edible seed meal such as wheat flour, corn flour, corn starch, modified starch, rice flour, potato flour, barley flour, or the like. Wheat flour is preferred, and may be bleached or unbleached.Bleached flour tends to produce less oven spread during baking. The dough may contain up to about 5 percent by weight, typically from about 1 to about 3 by weight of a leavening system, based upon the weight of the flour. a suitable leavening system comprises sodium bicarbonate, calcium phosphate, monobasic, and ammonium bicarbonate. The initial moisture content of the dough is adjusted to provide the desired consistency to the dough to enable proper mixing, working and shaping. The total moisture content of the dough will include any water included as a separately added ingredient, as well as the moisture provided by flour which usually contains about 12 to about 14 by weight moisture and the moisture content of other dough additives which may be included in the formulation, such as the humectant gel, high fructose corn syrup, invert syrups, or other liquid humectants. Taking into account all sources of moisture in the dough, including separately added water, the total initial moisture content of the dough is generally less than about 20 by weight of the dough formulation, exclusive of particulate inclusions such as nuts, raisins, chocolate chips, and the like.As moisture contents approach about 1820 by weight, the dough compositions may tend to stick excessively to processing equipment such as conveyors, dough cutters, and the like. Moisture contents of from about 12 by weight to about 16 by weight, based upon the weight of the dough are typically used. In addition to the foregoing, the cookie doughs used in the process of the invention may include other additives conventionally employed in cookies.Such additives may include, for example, chocolate liquor, salt, milk by products, egg or egg by products, vanilla, pregelatinized starch, such as pregelatinized corn, wheat, and waxy maize starch, peanut butter, cereal oatmeal as well as inclusions such as nuts, raisins, and coconut. Minor amounts of an emulsifier may also be used. Typical emulsifiers which can be used include sorbitan monostearate, mono and or di glycerides polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters, such as polysorbates e.g., polyoxyethylene 20 sorbitan monostearate , and sodium stearoyl 2 lactate. The cookie doughs of the present invention can be prepared in a conventional manner using a creaming stage and a dough forming stage. The sucrose, shortening or fat for preventing bloom, humectant, and flavoring ingredient for reducing mobility of the shortening or fat in the cookie are creamed together. This is followed by addition of water, leavening agent, and flour with mixing to form a dough. If a humectant gel is used, it is preferably preground and then mixed in during the creaming stage. The flavor chips are added as the last ingredient to the dough with minimal mixing so as to avoid smearing of the flavor chips into the dough. The dough is suitably cooled to about 60 to about 65 F about 15.6 to about 18.3 using carbon dioxide snow to facilitate its transfer to or through a suitable dough forming device. The dough is suitably cut into pieces using conventional wire cutting machines. The time and temperature of baking are adjusted in accordance with conventional techniques to provide a moisture content in the baked cookie of 6 percent or more, based upon the weight of the cookie, inclusive of inclusions such as flavor chips.A typical cookie produced in accordance with the present invention has a moisture content Brabender 145 C, 12 minutes of from about 7.8 to about 8.8 by weight, based upon the total weight of the cookie, which includes chocolate chips. Moisture contents are determined by first gririding the cookies and then using conventional moisture analysis techniques on the ground sample. Exemplary of such techniques are Brabender set at 145 C, for 12 minutes analysis or vacuum oven set at 70 C for 24 hours analysis, with appropriate correlation. The pH of the cookie suitably ranges from about 6.3 to about 7.0.The pH may be determined by grinding a sample of cookies and measuring the pH of a 10 by weight slurry in distilled water The water activity of the baked cookie should be less than about 0.7, preferably less than or equal to about 0.65, to assure microbial shelf stability. While baking times and temperatures will vary for different dough formulations, oven types, etc., in general commercial cookie baking times may range from about 5 minutes to about 15 minutes and baking temperatures for cookies may range from about 250 F 121 C to about 500 F 260 C . The method of the present invention is particularly suited for the prevention of bloom in moist, soft drop type cookies, such as fudge chocolate chip cookies, peanut butter fudge chocolate chip cookies, fudge chocolate chip raisin cookies, and the like. Fat bloom problems also may be guarded against in extended shelf like cake like moist, soft textured cookies such as peanut butter, chocolate chip cookies, oatmeal chocolate chip cookies, chocolate chip cookies, and peanut butter chocolate peanut butter chip cookies by replacement of higher melting shortening or fats with a shortening or fat which is essentially completely liquid at a temperature of about 100 F or less and has a solid fat index of less than about 13, e.g.from about 18 to about 25 at 500 F, and from about 7 to about 11 at 80 F. A typical higher melting shortening or fat used in the mass production of wire cut cookies is plasticized and is a partially hydrogenated soybean and cotton seed oil blend having a solid fat index of about 25 30 at 50 F, 17 22 at 70 F, 15 20 at 80 F, 11 14 at 92 F and 6 9 at 104 F. The present invention is further illustrated in the following examples where all parts, ratios, and percentages are by weight and all temperatures are in F, unless otherwise stated.EXAMPLE 1 The ingredients and their relative amounts used to prepare a bloom resistant fudge chocolate chip cookie with a moist, cake like soft textured crumb structure in accordance with the present invention were Ingredient Parts By WeightFlour 100 Sucrose Soybean Oil 50High Fructose Corn Syrup about 72 solids, 42 fructose, 50 dextrose 25Corn Syrup 6 DE 83 BE 5Honey 3 Preground High Fructose Corn Syrup based gel of Example I of ü.S.
