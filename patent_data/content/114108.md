# Method for cold sizing a round workpiece having multiple diameters.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus 12 for cold sizing a round work piece 14 having round surfaces of cylindrical shapes that are coaxial about a central axis A of the workpiece and have dif ferent diameters. A support 54, 55 rotatably mounts the workpiece 14 about its central axis A between a pair of die as semblies 24a, 24b which are spaced from each other. Each die assembly 24a, 24b includes a plurality of dies 56, 58, 60, 62 that are respectively aligned with the round surface 46, 48, 50, 52 of the workpiece 14 . Movement of the die assem blies in opposite directions as each other engages sizing sur faces 66, 68, 70, 72 of the dies with the aligned round sur faces of the workpiece to pressure size the workpiece sur faces. In one embodiment of the sizing apparatus 12 , the dies assemblies 24a, 24b have elongated shapes and are moved rectilinearly in a parallel relationship to each other to perform the sizing. Another rotary embodiment of the sizing apparatus 12 includes rotary die assemblies 24a , 24b mounted by associated spindles 85 whose rotation likewise pressure sizes the round workpiece surfaces. Both embodiments of the sizing apparatus are disclosed as including forming projections for forming projections for forming projections such as splines 82 and or helical thread 84 on the sized surfaces of the workpiece.
