# Conference bridge.

## Abstract
A conference bridge for a digital time division multiplex pulse code modulation telecommunication exchange in which for simplicity of operation each conference is allocated a unique channel number and each party within a conference is allocated a unique party number thus allowing any party to join any conference at any time.

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. A conference bridge for use in a digital time division multiplex pulse code modulation telecommunication exchange including a party RAM which stores individual party s contributions to a conference and a totaliser RAM which stores the calculated total contributions for each conference, means for subtracting each party s individual contribution to a conference from the calculated total contribution to the conference prior to the individual party receiving the conference total, in which each conference is allocated a unique channel number and each party within a conference is allocated a unique party number thus allowing each party to join a conference in any order. 2. A conference bridge as claimed in claim 1 in which a time slot is allocated in each conference to allow an operator to listen in to a conference without contributing to the conference. 3. A conference bridge as claimed in claim 2 in which each party contributes an 8 bit PCM coded signal to the conference, in which each 8 bit signal is converted to a 12 bit linear PCM signal prior to being added to each other signal in the conference, in an adder and in which following said addition a 15 bit PCM signal is created to allow for the expanded sum. 4. A conference bridge substantially as described with reference to the accompanying drawings.

## Description
CONFERENCE BRIDGE The present invention relates to conference bridges and more particular to conference bridges for use in digital time division multiplex PCM telecommunication exchanges. The conference bridge conferences 8 bit PCM data channels. The conference bridge of the present invention has been designed for use in the electronic switching system as described in our co pending British PatentApplication No 8323782. The conference bridge can be configured to conference 8 bit PCM voice samples which have been encoded linearly or to A law standards or law standards. All 8KHz sampling rates . Embodiments of the present invention will now be described, by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 shows the electronic switching system shown in the above co pending application and including a conference bridge according to the present invention, Figure 2 shows in block diagrammatic form a conference bridge according to the present invention, Figure 3 shows the circuit of Figure 2 in greater detail and, Figure 4 shows an exemplary generalised timing system for a conference bridge of Figure 2. With reference to Figure 1, the conference bridge 10 is equivalent to a whole shelf and hence has a shelf address within the system of Figure 1. It is addressable by the control computer not shown via theTDM network controller 114 and address bus ABO and data bus DBO. Data is transmitted by the bridge on the lower byte of the bus bits 8 15 and received on the upper byte bits 0 7 see Figure 2. In the telephone system such as described in our co pending British Patent Application No 8323782 the exchange for security has two separate control systems A and B and a conference bridge is allocated to each of the sides as shown. The operation of both bridges is identical. The Address bus command structure is of the formEMI2.1 1 Shelf address 2 Up down control 3 Conference channel number 4 Conference Party number 5 Transmit only. Function Control. See timing diagram for detailed timings.Each conference is allocated a unique channel number and each party within a conference a unique party nunber, the resulting seven bit address thus defines the individual contributions to a conference. This contribution may consist of 8 bit linearly encoded PCM voice or data samples or A law or u law encoded PCM samples. The renaining bit is used to enable an operator or other party to listen in on a conference without providing contributions to the conference. Thus enabling call monitoring functions to be performed. The conference bridge provides a two way connection by accumulating speech samples in the present time frame and supplying speech samples from the previous time frame s calculations. The output of the conference bridge in a given tine frame is the algebraic sum of the previous frane s samples for a given conference channel less the contribution of the party receiving the output. A tine frame is 125 us long in the system described. The conference bridge must not be addressed more often than once every four time slots each time slot being 144n sec long. That is if time slot n contains a conference bridge entry then time slots n l, n 2, n 3 must not contain any conference bridge entry. These connection constraints are needed in order for the conference bridge to receive and transmit data onto the system data bus at the required tine. The timing Of of signals can be seen from Figure 4 in which the upper set of waveforms and time slots CEC represent the timings for the Connon Equipment Card in this case the conference bridge and the lower set of waveforms and time slots represent the timings for examples for the telephony cards which require conference facilities. At time TO a shelf command to operate the conference bridge is transmitted on ABO. At time T1 a data byte is transmitted out onto the parallel data highway and at time T2 after a short delay the data byte is received off the data highway. Also at time T1 a data byte is transmitted on the system intershelf bus on DB0 8 15 and at time T3 data is transmitted on the systen shelf bus. For the telephony card a similar set of timings is required with a shelf slot command being given at timeTO generating a slot command at tine T4 which in turn generates an enable signal at time T5 causing data to be transmitted at tine T6 at which time data on shelf data bus DB0 bits 0 7 may be received from the conference bridge. At time T1 the data is present on the intershelf bus. Thus it may be seen that in a telephone exchange system correct synchronisation is necessary to ensure that data voice samples are received by the conference bridge at the correct time and that sufficient time is allowed to enable the conferencing to be carried out prior to the receipt of the conferenced signals by each subscriber associated with a telephony card. Bits 6 and 7 control the updown function, if the conference bridge has been downed it will ignore any commands sent to it on the address bus. Bit 6 Bit 7 0 X Normal conference bridge usage 1 0 Down command 1 1 Up command Because the commands sent to the bridge define the conference channel number up to sixteen 0 15 and the party number in each conference 0 7 uniquely the order of command connections in the connection table does not matter. Thus as each party joins a conference he is merely allocated the next slot in the connection table. If the speech samples in any conference channel on addition cause overflow to occur then the output is forced to plus or minus full scale. With reference now to Figure 2 the conference bridge comprises an address header circuit 202 which defines which shelf in the system the conference bridge appears to be. As the bridge occupies a whole shelf only a shelf address is required. The connections within the conference bridge are normally PCM coded signals fed in parallel over paths whose width is indlcated by the numerals giving the number of parallel path. The output of the address header 1s connected to a first input of an address comparison circuit 204 which checks to see if the address bus ABO 0 15 is addressing the conference bridge. The e address input from system address bus ABO 0 15 is latched into a latch circuit 206. A card enable up down logic circuit 208 is included to enable the particular confernce bridge to be enabled or disabled. In the latter case the alternative B side conference bridge will take over. The up down logic circuit 208 is connected to enable a timing state logic circuit 210 which controls the reception and transmission tinings of data onto and off the system bus. One output of the timing state logic circuit 210 is fed to a frame logic circuit 212 which controls the switching over at each time frame boundary of the running totals of each conference to give a total for a given time frame. A second output from the timing state logic circuit 210 is fed to a new frame first party logic circuit 214 which allows a first person into a conference to be written in and then every other party to be added to the conference. Eight bits of the output of the address latch 206 are fed to an address buffer 216. A first output of buffer 216 is used to identify in the new frame first party logic circuit 214 that a conference is required.A second output is used to initiate a decompanding PROM 218 which converts incoming 8 bit linear, A law or p law speech samples received from the upper byte of the system data bus DBO bits 8 15 via latch 220 into 12 bit linear PCM signals for addition in an adder 222.The adder 222 produces a 15 bit output signal to a totaliser RAM 224 which calculates the total contributions for each conference as controlled by the frame logic circuit 212 and identified by the output from the address buffer 216. The 15 bit output from adder 222 is necessary to allow the addition of more than one 12 bit number. Each output of the totaliser RAM 224 is fed back to the adder 222 via a latch 226 for addition to the next parties contribution and also to an adder 228. Each incoming parties contribution is stored in a party RAM 230 which stores each parties contribution in the last time frame. This contribution is accessed when the conference total is output from the totaliser RAM 224 and is subtracted therefrom by inverting it in an inverter 232 and adding the two sums together in adder 228 to give an effective subtraction. The output of adder 228 is fed to an error detect and correct circuit 234 which detects if the remaining total which is equal to the sun of all the parties contributions less the addressed party s own contribution is still greater than the maximum permitted value and if it is it forces full scale output either positive or negative as required to avoid any over under flow to the companding PROM 236 which recompands the now 12 bits linear to A law, p law or to 8 bits linear. The output of PROM 236 is fed to a latch circuit 238 which stores the finalised PCM sample prior to transmission onto output data bus DB 0 7 via a bus driver 240.
