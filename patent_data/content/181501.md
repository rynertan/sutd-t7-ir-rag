## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTION MeLlsod for making complementary MOS integrated circuitFIELD OF THE INVENTION AND RELATED ART STATEMENT 1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invent ion relates generally to inlprovements in method for making complementary MOS integrated circuit and more particularly to method for nlaking complementary MOS integrated circuit which method is capable of preventing an oxidation induced defect. 2. DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART In recent years, double well complementaryMOS integrated circuit is attracting attention in place of the convent. ional single well complementary MOS integrated circuit, because the former can individually optimize cllarclcters of N MOS and P MOS for well balance between the characters of N MOS and P MOS, while the single well complementary MOS integrated circuit has been difficult to apply to minute patterned integrated circuit because the single well complementary MOS integrated circuit cannot individually optimize characters of N MOS and P MOS for well balance between tli characters of N MOS and P MOS. N well regions and P well regions of the double well complementary MOS integrated circuit are usually produced by self alignment method having only one time of pholo masking step for attaining a high degree of an integration and making the producing step 5 impale. FIG.la, FIG.lb, FIG.lc and FIG.ld show prior art self alignment method for making N well and P well regions. As shown in F G. Ia, a silicon nitride film 3 is formed on a thermal oxidation film 2 formed on a silicon substrate 1. As shown in FIG. lb, a silicon nitride film 3 is selectively removed by photoetching method. An N type region 4 is formed in the silicon substrate 1 by injecting accelerated ions 6 of N type impurity. Next, a silicon dioxide thick film 2 is formed on the N type region 4 by local oxidation using the silicon nitride film 3 as mask. As shown in FIG.lc, a P type region 5 is formed in the silicon substrate I by injecting accelerated ions 7 of P type impurity using the silicon dioxide thick film 2 as mask. Next as shown in FIG. ld, an N well region and a P well region are formed by carrying out a drive in to type region 5. As mentioned above the prior art method necessitates iloermal oxidations for two time, a growth step for silicon dioxide film and an etching step for silicon dioxide film. Talus the prior art method has disadvantage of complexity of steps and such a disadvantage that an oxidation induced defect often occurs in the local oxidati OBJECT AND SUMMARY OF TIIE INVENTION It is an object of the invention to provide an improved method for making double well complementaryMOS integrated circuit, wherein the method is simple and does not lead to the oxidation induced defect. An improved method for making double well complementary MOS integrated circuit in accordance with the present invention comprises a first ion implantation for selectively injecting impurity of first conductivity type into semi conductor substrate by using a photoresist pat tern for mask, a step for forming a thin film on the photoresist pattern and the semiconductor substrate on which the photores is t pat tern is not formed, step of removing the photoresist pat tern on which the thin film is formed, and ion implantation second step for selectively injecting impurity of second conductivity type in semiconductor substrate by using the thin film retained after the removing of the mask.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING FIG.la, FIG.lb FIG.lc and FIG.ld are crosssectional Side views for showing steps of a prior art method for making double well complementary MOS integrated circuit.

By thermal oxidation, an SiO2 film 2 having about 50 nm thickness is formed on a surface of an N type silicon substrate 1 having specific resistance of 20 to 50 cm. As shown in FIG. 2a, by photolithographic method a pliotoresist pattern 8 which has windows to form an ion implanted layer 4 is formed.Next, the ion implanted layer 4 is formed in the silicon substrate 1 by injecting accelerated ions 6 of N Lype impurity such as phosphoric ions. The phosphoric ions are accelerated by acceleration e lee Lrode having 100 MV and are injected wi Ih dose amount of about 5x10 12 cm2. he amount of the injection is desirable 12 2 13 2 within a range between 1x10 cm to lxlO cm . Next, as shown in FIG. 2b, an aluminum thin film 9 having about 0.4 in to 4 m 1 m is desirable thickness is ev u p rated, and subsequently the photoresist 8 is removed. Theref re, the aluminum thin film 9 formed on the photoresist 8 is lifted off and the aluminum thin film 9 is retained only on the ion implanted layer 4Next, as shown in FIG. 2c, P type ion implanted layer 5 is formed in the silicon substrate 1 by injecting accelerated ions 7 of P type impurity such as boron ions.The boron ions are accelerated by an ac c 1 era Li on electrode impressed with 50 KV and are injected with dose amount of about 7x1012 cm2Preferable amount of the injection is within a range between 1x1012 cm2 to 1x1013cm3. Next, remaining aluminum thin film 9 is removed by known etching process using a phosphoric etching solution. After removing a surface layer of the SiO2 film 2 for carrying out a washing, as shown in FIG. 2d, N well region 10 and P well region 11 are formed by carrying out a drive in. A silicon dioxide film 2 is formed by the drive in. Such process causes concentration of phosphor in the N well region 10 to about 5x10 cm 3 and that in the P well region 11 to about 7x1016 cm3. Experiments shows that both of impurity atom concentrations of the N well region 10 and the P well region 11 are desirable within a range between 1x1016 cm3 to lxlO 17 cm3. Subsequent steps are the same as the prior art method for making complementaryMOS integrated circuit. As mentioned above, in accordance with the present invention a double well complementary MOS integrated circuit without the oxidation induced detect can be provided by simple steps.
