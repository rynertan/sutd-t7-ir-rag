# GENERATING POWER FROM WIND

## Abstract
A wind machine turns a shaft to activate a multistage positive displacement pump having intake and discharge means respectively coupled to intake and discharge fluid lines in a recirculating hydraulic system. Control means regulates the operative positions of the intake means, dis charge means or separate idling means to remove selected stages from effective pumping while at the same time fluid passes into and from the selected stages. The stages can be of different capacities and selected groups or all of them may be periodically idled by a common or individual idling means. Constricting means is located in the common dis charge line from all stages and can be additionally located in each discharge line from each stage. Automatic control of torque on the wind rotor shaft by the idling and constricting means permits the rotor to start to rotate, continue to rotate at a speed for maximum efficiency conversion of the wind power into hydraulic power over any desired range of wind speeds, rotate as limited to any specified maximum rates rotation during high wind speeds, and to stop and lock if the wind speed becomes excessive. The hydraulic system can parallel connect a number of wind machines to drive a sin gle turbine installation to produce useful power.
