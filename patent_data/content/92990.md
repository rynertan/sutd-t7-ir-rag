# MYCORRHIZAL SEED PELLETS

## Abstract
It has been a problem to pellet seeds with inoculum of the beneficial VA mycorrhizal fungus. Hitherto, clay or soil pellets have been tried but they are difficult to adjust to a suitable moisture content and the pellets are too heavy, and there is a problem in placement of the seed so as to ensure that the radicle will grow through the pellet and thereby pick up the desired fungal infection. It has now been found that satisfactory pellets can be made using peat, preferably sphagnum moss peat, and a binder instead of soil and that even when the pellet is dried considerably the inoculum retains infectivity for at least 6 months, using sphagnum moss peat. The composition in uncompacted and compacted forms and a method of growing plant from seed are claimed. The invention is useful for improving the condition of poor soil, e.g. filled in gravel pits or coal mine spoil tips.
