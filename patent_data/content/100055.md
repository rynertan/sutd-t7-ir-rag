# Friction material.

## Abstract
This disclosure is directed to a friction material which includes a porous material and capsules containing a hydrophobic substance in a liquid form. The porous material and capsules are formed into a composite structure by a binding agent so as to use the hydrophobic substance con tained in the capsules for a component of a lubricating layer to be formed on the friction material upon breakage of the capsules.
