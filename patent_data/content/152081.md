## Abstract
A machining center in which the moment M exerted on a support base 21 and support table 28 during a machin ing operation is remarkably reduced. The machining appar atus includes a pair of guide rails 29,30 extending in the longitudinal direction X relative to the workpiece upon which the machining head 32,35 is slidably supported either directly or via a table. The rear one 30 of this pair of guide rails 29,30 is made higher than the other guide rail 29 , thereby reducing the reaction forces exerted upon the upper surfaces of the guide rails 29,30 , and hence the moment M exerted on the supporting base 21 .
