# Digital input analog drive positioning system.

## Abstract
In a digital input analog drive positioning system, in order to simplify the circuitry of the absolute difference generator used to calculate the magnitude and sign of the difference between the digital target input and the digital current position value, the pre adder 31 magnitude comparator is omitted. One input 36 to the adder contains complementing circuitry 34 as does the output from the adder. The carry out 38 from the adder 31 is latched and used to select connection by complementing or carry handling in response to application of a carry in signal as well as to determine the sign of the difference line 43 if both input and value are positive, additional circuitry being required else.
