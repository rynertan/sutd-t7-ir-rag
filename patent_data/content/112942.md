# Graphics display system and method.

## Abstract
The invention concerns a graphics display system of the kind having a refresh raster display device, a line clipping mechanism for clipping line primitives for viewing in a selected rectangular viewport having horizontal and vertical edges parallel to the X and Y axes respectively of the display area of the display device, and a vector to raster converter for converting the clipped lines to patterns of discrete pels in a refresh buffer, the vector to raster converter including an incremental line drawing mechanism responsive to line information supplied by the clipping mechanism to draw the line starting at one endpoint and proceeding towards the other. In such a system, for at least some lines of a kind which have a first endpoint in the viewport and the second endpoint outside the viewport, the clipping mechanism is arranged to avoid calculating the intersection point of the line with the viewport edge intersected by the line, and the vector to raster converter is arranged to start the line drawing mechanism at the first endpoint and halt the line drawing mechanism when the currently generated coordin ate along the display axis normal to the said viewport edge equals the coordinate of the viewport edge along the same axis. In the preferred embodiment the said lines of the kind referred to comprise lines for which the second endpoint lies in an outregion laterally adjacent the viewport and the viewport edge intersected by the line is normal to the stepping axis of the line drawing mechanism, and the vector to raster converter is arranged to halt the line drawing mechanism when the number of iterations performed by the mechanism equals the magnitude of the coordinate differ ence along the stepping axis between the first endpoint and the viewport edge, in particular by forcing the stepping loop count of the line drawing mechanism to the said magnitude. The invention also provides a method corresponding to the above system.
