# POLYMER MODIFIED POLYOLS

## Abstract
Polymer modified polyols of reduced viscosity are made by reacting an organic polyisocyanate with a low molecular weight hydroxyl containing compound in a polyol in the pre sence of a specified dispersant. The dispersant, which is of a type known for dispersing pigments in paints is obtained by reacting 1 a copolymer comprising units derived from the fol lowing ethylenically unsaturated monomers in the stated proportions by weight based on the total weight of the copolymer a 0 50 of a hydroxy group containing monomer, and or b 0 20 of an amide group containing monomer, pro vided that there is always present at least 5 of a and b c 20 80 of a monomer free from carboxyl groups and containing a straight or branched chain alkyl group of from 7 to 22 carbon atoms, and d 0 50 of one or more monomers free from the hyd roxy, amide and C₇ ₂₂ alkyl groups present in a , b or c , and also, as an essential constituent, e up to 20 of a monomer containing an epoxide group, the total of monomers a , b , c , d and e being 100 , with 2 a compound bearing a carboxyl group and a group having pigment dispersant characteristics. Preferably it is a copolymer of styrene 2 ethyl hexyl acry late hydroxy isopropylmethacrylate methacrylamide glycidyl methacrylate in the ratios 26 40 25 5 4, modified by esterification with p aminobenzoic acid in the presence of dimethyl dodecyl tertiary amine. The modified polyols of particular interest are those used in the manufacture of flexible foam slabstock.
