# Pyrazine derivatives.

## Abstract
Novel pyrazine derivatives are disclosed. The com pounds possess a potent platelet aggregation inhibiting activity and are effective for preventing diseases caused by aggregation of the platelet, for example, myocardial infarc tion and cerebral thrombosis. Representative examples of the pyrazine derivatives include 2,3 bis p chlorophenyl 5 methylpyrazine, 2,3 bis p methoxyphenyl 5 methyl pyrazine, 2,3 diphenyl 5 benzylpyrazine, 2,3 diphenyl 5 p methoxybenzyl pyrazine, 2,3 bis p methoxyphenyl 5 isopropylpyrazine, 2,3 bis p methoxyphenyl 5 2 thienylmethyl pyrazine and 2,3 bis p methoxyphenyl 5,6 dimethylpyrazine. The pyrazine derivatives can be generally prepared by heating a benzil derivative and a 1,2 diaminoethane deriva tive to produce a dihydropyrazine derivative and heating the resulting compound with sulfur at 100 180 C.
