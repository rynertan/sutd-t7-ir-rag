# Vibration attenuating coupling.

## Abstract
The coupling comprises a housing 10 receiving the in ner end of a nipple 44 which supports a flange 40 . An annu lar elastomeric ring 70 within the housing imposes an axial force upon the nipple, and an inner bearing 83 complemen tary in configuration to existing housing surfaces 16 and oriented therein by such surfaces is engaged by the nipple in ner end 40 and includes an elastomeric material 88 wherein elastic material, alone, supports the nipple relative to the hous ing for absorbing vibrations and permitting misalignment.
