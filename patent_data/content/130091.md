# Apparatus for recording and or reproducing digital information signals.

## Abstract
Apparatus for recording and or reproducing a digital information signal with sampling frequencies fs1, fs2, fs3, fsn comprises a circuit 14, 15 for selecting one of the sampl ing frequencies and a circuit 10 for generating a field clock signal having a field frequency F determined by the equation fs1 N1 fs2 N2 fs3 N3 fsn Nn F, where N1, N2, N3, Nn are the number of data words in one field.
