# Expandable van top tent assembly.

## Abstract
The top of the van includes a perimetrical wall defining an opening 20 with a hinged cover panel 16 which opens to a horizontal position on one side of the van. A tent or enclosure 26 is secured by the edges, around the perimet rical wall of the opening and around the free edges of the cover panel. A plurality of hoop braces 34, 35, 35A are hinged to the wall and to the cover panel and the flexible enclosure is secured to these hoops so that the hoops are erected when the cover panel is opened. The cover panel is supported horizontally in the opened position by means of tension cables 45 extending from the other edge of the opening, to the hoop braces to thwich it is secured, and is then secured to the distal edge 18 of the cover panel by the other end thereof thus eliminating any need for vertical supports. If desired, a flexible porch 57 can be detachably secured around the three edges of the cover panel when open, and can depend therefrom to the ground. Access to the upper tent portion is from the interior of the van through the opening in the roof thereof uncovered when the cover panel is open.

## Description
EXPANDABLE VAN TOP TENT ASSEMBLY This invention relates to vehicles including expandable van top tent assemblies. It can also be used upon truck campers or the like. Tent assemblies are known which extend from the sides of the van and also which can be erected upon the upper surface of a van, truck camper or car. However, these require extensive alterations and or extensive storage space and are generally unsatisfactory. It is one object of the invention therefore to provide a relatively simple enclosure which is secured to and is opened by a hinged cover panel formed within the roof of the van. In accordance with the invention there is provided a vehicle including a body having sides, ends and a roof and having a substantially rectangular opening within said roof defined by a pair of spaced and parallel longitudinally extending edges and a pair of spaced and parallel transverse edges, a cover panel hinged by one side thereof to one side edge of the opening and movable between a closed position covering the opening to an open position characterized in that the cover panel is movable in the open position so as to extend substantially horizontally from said one side edge, and in that there are provided means for supporting said cover panel in the open horizontal position, a flexible enclosure secured by the lower edges thereof to the other edges of the opening and to the free sides of the cover panel, a plurality of substantially U shaped hoop braces hinged by the ends thereof to the roof and or to the cover panel adjacent the transverse edges defining the opening, and means to secure said enclosure to said hoops whereby, when said cover panel is opened, the flexible enclosure and the hoops are erected by said enclosure to extend over the opening and the cover panel. One advantage of the invention is that access to the enclosure is from the interior of the van rather than from the exterior thereof. A further advantage of the invention is that the cover panel is supported in the horizontal open position by means of tensioning cables thereby eliminating the necessity for vertical supports, tent poles and the like. A yet further advantage of the invention is to provide a device of the character herewithin described which, when folded and the cover panel closed, is stored between the roof edges and the cover panel. Embodiments of the invention will now be described in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a side elevation of a van with the cover panel shown in the closed position Figure 2 is an isometric view of the van showing the cover panel and enclosure in the open position and the screened porch erected Figure 3 is a partially schematic cross sectional view of Figure 2 Figure 4 is a fragmentary cross sectional view similar to Figure 3 including modified hoop braces and showing the cover panel support cables Figure 5 is a fragmentary partially sectioned view of the embodiment of Figure 4 showing an alternative attachment of the main hoop brace to the enclosure Figure 6 is a fragmentary cross sectional view showing one method of attaching the screened porch Figure 7 is a view similar to Figure 6, but showing an alternative method Figure 8 is a side view of the embodiment ofFigure 4 Figure 9 is a fragmentary end view of the embodiment of Figure 4 showing the subsidiary hoop braces in the closed position and with the torsion spring closed and Figure 10 is a partial cross sectional view of the embodiment of Figure 4 and showing one of the detachable spreader bars in position. Proceeding therefore to describe the invention in detail, reference to the drawings will show a conventional van collectively designated 10 having sides 11 and rear wall 12 which normally contains doors not illustrated , and a roof 13. The roof includes the upwardly extending sides 14 and the top panel 15. The present invention constitutes an improvement to existing vans by providing a portion of the roof collectively designated 16 in the form of a cover panel having a substantially planar portion 17, a downturned outer, longitudinally extending flange or wall 18 and a downturned, longitudinally extending inner flange 19. A substantially rectangular opening 20 is formed within the roof and defined by spaced and parallel longitudinal edges 21 and 22 and spaced and parallel transverse edges 23, one of which only is shown in Figure 3.The edges 21, 22, 23 are spaced inwardly of the extremities of the cover panel 16 so as to define an overlapping flange portion relative thereto to provide sealing around the outside edge of the opening 20 relative to the cover panel 16 when closed. The panel 16 particularly includes flanges 33 at right angles to the flange 18 and extending downwardly therefrom at the edge thereof and spaced outwardly of the edges 23 for cooperation with the flange portion adjacent thereto. The cover panel 16 is hinged by the flange 19 to the longitudinal edge 22 defining the opening 20 with reference character 24 illustrating the hinge. This enables the cover panel to be moved between the open position shown in Figure 3 and the closed position shown inFigure 1 with conventional latches 25 detachably securing the flange 18 of the cover panel to the side 11. In order to improve sealing between the flange portion at the longitudinal edge 21 and the panel 17, conventional sealing strips not illustrated are provided. A flexible enclosure is provided collectively designated 26 including a side or main panel 27 and end panels 28 sewn together to form the enclosure and being provided with mesh screens 29 in the end panels, if desired. The side or main panel 27 is secured by an edge 30 thereof to a position outboard of the longitudinal edge 21 by conventional means such as nut and bolt assemblies 31 and by the other edge 32 thereof to the inside of the cover panel adjacent the junction between the flange 18 and the panel 17 by similar means not illustrated . The end panels are secured by similar means not illustrated outwardly of the transverse flanges 23 defining the opening and inwardly of the transverse flanges 33 of the cover panel. A plurality of substantially U shaped hoop braces is provided including a main hoop brace 34 and subsidiary hoop braces 35, 35A G One subsidiary hoop brace 35 is pivotally secured by the distal ends 36 thereof to brackets 37 on the flange portion adjacent the edge 23 of the opening and the other subsidiary brace 35A is pivotally secured by the ends thereof to brackets 38 adjacent the side flanges 33 of the cover panel 16, as clearly illustrated in Figure 3. The main hoop brace 34 includes pins 39 extending outwardly from adjacent the ends 40 thereof and these pins engage apertured brackets 41 which are secured to adjacent the ends of the flange portion at the edge 22 of the opening 20. These apertured brackets 41 each include a detent 42 so that when the cover panel is opened to the position shown in Figure 3, the main hoop brace may be elevated manually and the pins 39 hooked into the detents 42 in order to tension the enclosure 26 The transverse main portions 43 of the hoop braces 34, 35, 35A engage pocket sleeves 44 sewn to the interior of the main enclosure panel 27 so that when the cover panel is opened to the position shown in Figure 3, the flexible enclosure is opened also and this in turn moves the hoop braces to the erected position illustrated in Figure 3., thus forming the erected enclosure. Means to support the cover panel in the horizontal position are omitted from Figure 3 for convenience of illustration but are shown in Figure 4. These means take the form of one or more flexible cables 45 and it is preferable that two such cables be provided, one adjacent each end of the enclosure. The cables are secured by one end 46 thereof to hooks or rings 47 which, in turn, are secured adjacent the lower edge 30 of the main panel 27, said hooks or rings being secured to the flange portion adjacent the edge 21 of the van. The cables then extend to a respective end of each of the cross members 43 of the subsidiary hoop braces 35, 35A sequentially, and are secured to these hoop braces by any conventional means such as clamps 48.The other ends 49 of the cables 45 are secured to hooks or rings 50 situated adjacent the end 32 of the main panel 27 where it is joined to adjacent the outer edge flange 18 of the cover panel. Adjusting tùrnbuckles 51 may be provided along the length of the cables in order to adjust the tension thereof and the length of these cables is such that when the enclosure is in the open position shown in Figure 3, the cables support the cover panel in a horizontal position as illustrated. It should also be noted from the embodiment of Figure 8 that the portions of the cables extending between the innermost side hoop braces 35 and the adjacent hooks or rings 47 defined as the inner securing portion of the cables incline inwardly and downwardly towards one another due to the fact that the hooks or rings 47 are secured inboard of the edges 23 of the opening 20.This provides necessary side stability to the enclosure when extended and reduces the possibility of sideways movement and subsequent collapse of the enclosure. Figures 4, 5 and 8 show an alternative embodiment in which the main hoop brace 34A is situated externally of the enclosure whereas all of the hoop braces shownIn Figure 3 are situated internally thereof. In this embodiment, the legs 52 of the main hoop brace 34A are pivoted to brackets 53 secured to the roof panel and the cross member portion 54 of the main hoop brace 34A extends through a pocket 55 formed on the outside of the main panel 27 of the enclosure and at the apex 56 thereof. In addition, this embodiment is modified relative to that of Figure 3 in that the subsidiary hoop braces 35, 35A are pivoted from a central block 35B secured to the flange of the roof adjacent the edge 22 and lying on the same pivot axis as the main hoop brace 34A. When in the open position shown in Figure 3, a flexible screened porch enclosure collectively designated 57 may be supported by the cover panel 16, said screened porch enclosure consisting of three sides of flexible fabric, two ends 58 and a front panel 59 with screened windows 60 being provided therein. The upper edges of the sides 58 and 59 may be secured to the outer edges of the flanges 33 and 18 either by means of fastening material such as Velcro trade mark 61 and shown in Figure 6 or press studs 62 as shown in Figure 7 or any other conventional form of detachable securement.The sides 58 and the front 59 hang downwardly and extend between the cover panel and the ground and, if necessary, a canvas skirt 64 may be secured such as by hooks and eyes 65, to along the lower edge of the side of the van and extend downwardly to the ground thus enclosing the space under the van body. Access to the inside of the enclosure 26 is by means of the aperture 20 in the roof of the van and bedding may be provided upon the inside of the horizontally extending cover panel 16. When in the folded position, the hoop brace 34 is disengaged from the detents 42 and the cover panel is moved to the closed position shown in Figure 1. The hoop braces 35 and 34 pivot in the direction of arrow 66 and the hoop brace 35A pivots in the direction of arrow 67. With the fabric of the enclosure between adjacent hoop braces concertinering between adjacent hoops and being stored in the space surrounding the aperture 20 and defined by flanges 18, 19 and 33 of the cover panel 16 and the flange portions adjacent the edges 21, 22 and 23 of the opening 20. Latches 25 hold the cover panel in the closed position and sealing relationship with the top of the van. Figures 4, 8, 9 and 10 show the preferred embodiment of the invention in which a relatively heavy duty torsion spring component is provided collectively designated 66 which includes a loop spring portion 67 with a pair of legs 68 extending therefrom and terminating in blocks 69 which are in turn provided with a pivot or swiveling socket indicated by reference character 70 which in turn is attached one each to each leg 71 and 71A of the subsidiary hoop braces 35 and 35A respectively with the loop spring portion 67 being adjacent the distal ends 36 thereof and brackets 35B. The attachment of the swiveling sockets 70 may be by means of the pivot pins extending through the sockets and through the legs 71 and 71A respectively. It should also be noted that although one such spring component 66 is shown, it is preferable to have one such component at each end of the subsidiary hoop braces. These torsion springs normally urge the subsidiary braces apart from one another through approximately an angle indicated by reference character 72 in Figure 9. However, when the cover panel is in the fully opened position as illustrated in Figure 4, these torsion spring components are then in tension and are attempting to close the cover panel or draw the subsidiary hoops towards one another and the angular extension of the spring thus providing this closing action is illustrated by reference character 73 in Figure 4. It will therefore be seen that the springs not only act to assist in the opening of the cover panel, but also in the closing thereof. It will therefore be appreciated that some means is required in order to hold the cover panel 16 in the fully opened position shown in Figure 4. Reference to Figures 8 and 10 will show a spreader bar component 74 having U shaped sockets 75 on each end thereof which are detachably engaged between the horizontal members or portions 43 of the subsidiary hoop braces 35, 35A, it being understood once again that there is preferably one such spreader bar adjacent each end of the horizontal portion 43. It will be appreciated that although the specification and drawings show the invention as installed upon a van 10, nevertheless it is readily applicable to truck campers, cars such as station wagons and the like. It will also be appreciated that the cover panel 16 can be supported by detachable diagonal braces not illustrated extending between the adjacent side 11 of the van and the outer side of the cover panel 16. In a further modification not shown , the spreader bars 74 are replaced by bars which are foldable about a mid point and lockable in their straight condition by an over center mechanism so that they can remain connected to the subsidiary hoop braces 35, 35A when the cover panel is closed, to avoid problems of separate storage. Since various modifications can be made in my invention as hereinabove described, and many apparently widely different embodiments of same made within the spirit and scope of the claims without departing from such spirit and scope, it is intended that all matter contained in the accompanying specification shall be interpreted as illustrative only and not in a limiting sense.
