# A PULSE GENERATOR

## Abstract
The invention relates to a pulse generator of the type comprising a capacitor, means for periodically discharging the capacitor to produce the pulses and means for recharg ing the capacitor between pulses. There is a problem when, due to fault conditions in the load the capacitor is left with a reverse charge after a pulse. This problem is dealt with by sensing such a residual reverse charge and for discharging the stored energy in such a way that it is used to contribute towards recharging the capacitor for the next pulse.
