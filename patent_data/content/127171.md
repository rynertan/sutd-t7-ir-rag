## Description
Developing liquid for photoresist The present invention relates to a developing liquid for photoresist. A process for manufacturing a semiconductor device includes a photo etching step for patterning a thin film, etc., formed on a semiconductor substrate.In the photo etching step, the surface of a semiconductor wafer is treated, and then coated with a photoresist film. Thereafter, the photoresist film is prebaked, and then subjected to mask alignment, exposure, development, rinsing, postbaking, etc., to form a photoresist pattern. If an alkali soluble photoresist is used, an aqueous solution of tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide hereinafter abbreviated TMAH or trimethyl hydroxyethyl ammonium hydroxide hereinafter abbreviated THAH is used as a developing liquid. Since the developing liquid formed of the aqueous solution of TMAH or THAH is high in temperaturedependence, its developing speed will vary on each occasion, failing to provide a resist film of a desired pattern size. Conventionally, therefore, a developing vessel is provided with a heat regulator for temperature control in the development, thus complicating its construction. The object of the present invention is to provide a developing liquid for photoresist which greatly reduces fluctuations in the developing speed when used at a temperature within a predetermined range, and hence which is capable of easily forming a resist film of a desired pattern without requiring temperature control. A developing liquid for a photoresist according to the invention comprises an aqueous solution which contains tetraalkyl ammonium hydroxide and trialkyl hydroxylalkyl ammonium hydroxide at a weight ratio ranging from 5 2 to 1 10. The weight ratio between the tetraalkyl ammonium hydroxide and the trialkyl hydroxylalkyl ammonium hydroxide preferably ranges from 1 1 to 1 6, and, most preferably, is 1 4. The tetraalkyl ammonium hydroxide is formulated as follows EMI2.1 Here R1, R2, R3 and R4 are alkyl groups. These alkyl groups preferably include methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl groups. The most preferably used tetraalkyl ammonium hydroxide according to the invention is tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide hereinafter abbreviatedTMAH . The trialkyl hydroxyalkyl ammonium hydroxide is formulated as follows R1 3N R20H OH . 2 Here R1 is an alkyl group, and R2OH is a hydroxyalkyl group. The methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl group is preferably used for the alkyl group, and the hydroxylmethyl, hydroxylethyl, hydroxylpropyl or hydroxylbutyl group for the hydroxylalkyl group.The most preferably used trialkyl hydroxylalkyl ammonium hydroxide according to the invention is trimethyl bydroxylethyl ammonium hydroxide hereinafter abbreviated THAH . TMAH CH3 4NOH can be obtained through a reaction between trimethylamine CH3 3N and methyl bromide CH3 Br as follows CH3 3N CH3 Br CH3 4NBr, ... 3 CH3 4NBr Ag OH v CH3 4NOH AgBr A. ... 4 THAH CH3 3N CH2CH20H OH can be obtained through a reaction between trimethylamine CH3 3N and ethylene oxide as follows CH3 3N CH2 20 H20 CH3 3N C2H40H OH. ... 5 The weight ratio between TMAH and THAH ranging from 5 2 to 1 10 is used for the following reason. If the content of TMAH exceeds 2.5 times that of THAH, the resultant developing liquid is not more effective than a liquid formed only of TMAH. If the content of TMAH is less than a tenth that ofTHAH, on the other hand, the resultant developing liquid is not more effective than a liquid formed only of THAH, and is not improved in the temperaturedependence of developing speed. For lower temperaturedependence of developing speed, the weight ratio between TMAH and THAH preferably ranges from 1 1 to 1 6, and, most preferably, is 1 4. The developing liquid of the invention is applied to an alkali soluble photoresist. The alkalisoluble photoresist may be of a positive or negative type. Some of positive type photoresists contain naphthoquinone diadido as a photosensitive group and a novolac resin as the base resin. The resists of this type include OF PR800 trademark, Tokyo Oka Co., Ltd. , AZ1470 trademark, Siphley Co., Ltd. , etc. Negative type photoresists include RU 1OOQN Hitachi Kasei Co., Ltd. , etc. This invention can be more fully understood from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a graph showing the relationships between the developing speed of an exposed photoresist film and the temperatures of developing liquids and Fig. 2 is a graph showing the relationships between the developing speed of an unexposed photoresist film and the temperatures of the developing liquids. An example of the present invention will now be described. Example First, a silicon wafer was coated with a photoresist film of a prescribed composition by the spin coating method. Then, the resultant structure was baked at 850C for 30 minutes. After baking, the photoresist film was 1.5 microns thick. Ultraviolet rays were applied to the structure at a dose rate of 80mJ cm2 by using a superhigh pressure mercury lamp.Then, the structure was developed by using developing liquids I to V of the following varied compositions according to the present invention at various liquid temperatures ranging from 10 to 30 C. After developing, the thickness of the remaining photoresist film was measured to determine the developing speed. Fig. 1 shows the results of such measurement. In Fig. 1, curves I to V indicate the relationships between the liquid temperature and the developing speed for the developing liquids I to V, respectively. An unexposed photoresist film was developed in the same manner, and checked for the change of the developing speed compared with the liquid temperature. Fig. 2 shows the results of such examination. In Fig. 2, curves I to V indicate the relationships between the liquid temperature and the developing speed for the developing liquids I to V, respectively. The developing liquids I to V are mixtures of a 2.3 aqueous solution of TMAH and a 4.6 aqueous solution of THAH by weight at weight ratios of 5 1, 2 Ii 1 2, 1 3 and 1 5, respectively. The net weight ratios between TMAH and THAH in these individual developing liquids are shown in the table below. TABLEEMI5.1 tb Developing SEP liquid SEP TMAH THAH SEP Weight SEP Ratio tb SEP I SEP 5 2 tb SEP II SEP 1 1 SEP tb SEP III SEP 1 SEP SEP 4 tb SEP IV SEP 1 6 SEP tb SEP V SEP 1 SEP SEP 10 tb A developing liquid VI formed only of a 2.3 aqueous solution of TMAH by weight and a developing liquid VII formed only of a 4.6 aqueous solution ofTHAH by weight were prepared as controls. Under the same conditions as aforesaid, exposed and unexposed photoresist films were developed by using these developing liquids VI and VII, and were checked for the relationships between the developing speed and the liquid temperature. Curves VI and VII of Fig. 1 and curves VI and VII of Fig. 2 indicate the results of such an examination. As seen from the graph of Fig. 1, the temperature dependence of the developing speed is improved for those liquids whose weight ratios betweenTMAH and THAH range from 5 2 to 1 10, and especially from 1 1 to 1 6. It may be understood that the weight ratio of 1 4 provides the steadiest developing speed. It may also be seen that the temperature dependence of the developing speed of the developing liquid containing only TMAH or THAH is high for both exposed and unexposed photoresists. According to the developing liquid for the photoresist of the present invention, as described above, a steady developing speed less dependent on temperature may be obtained within the temperature range of 10 to 300C. Since development is normally performed at room temperature ranging from 20 to 260C, it is quite unnecessary to control the temperature of the developing liquid by using a heat regulator.Also, because the normal temperature of a developing liquid storage chamber ranges from 10 to 30 C, the developing liquid can be used directly from the storage chamber. The concentrations of the aqueous solutions of TMAH and THAH can suitably be selected according to the developing speed, photoresist film thickness, and developing time, etc.
