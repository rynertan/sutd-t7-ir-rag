# ION MEASURING DEVICE WITH SELF CONTAINED STORAGE OF STANDARDIZATION SOLUTION

## Abstract
An ion measuring device pH meter is adapted to store and discharge standardizing solution, as well as to provide measurements of the hydrogen or other ion concentrations of unknown samples the device including a working electrode of known construction and a reference electrode adjacent to the working electrode and further including at least one stor age reservoir for containing a standardizing solution, and a measuring or standardizing chamber located at the lower end of the reservoir with means, preferably in the form of a valve, for permitting communication between the reservoir and standardizing chamber such that standardization and calibra tion can be carried out.
