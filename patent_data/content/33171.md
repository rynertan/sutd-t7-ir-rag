# Process for dewatering aqueous coal slurries.

## Abstract
A process for the preparation of a dry coal product from two aqueous slurries of coal particles, a first slurry containing relatively small particles and a second slurry containing relatively large particles, which process comprises agglomerating the coal particles in the first slurry with 10 30 w, based on the weight of said small particles, of a binder, mixing the agglomerates thus obtained with the second slurry and dewatering the mixture with a mechanical means, e.g. a centrifuge, in which the agglomerates at least partly, disintegrate.
