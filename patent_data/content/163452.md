The process depicted in Scheme I entails reacting a ss lactam substrate II with between about 1.0 to about 6 molar equivalents of the allyl tin compound IV in the presence of a free radical initiator. The solvents used for the above process are substantially anhydrous aromatic hydrocarbons or 1,2dimethoxyethane. The reaction is carried out under a substantially inert atmosphere. In the description of Scheme I, the terms C1 to C7 alkyl , C1 to C6 alkoxy , C1 to C4 alkyl , C1 toC4 alkoxy , protected carboxy , carboxy protecting group , 1 protected amino , amino protecting group , protected hydroxy , hydroxy protecting group , and substituted phenyl are the same as described for the 4 R,S substituted selenyl azetidinone starting materials of formula I.

For the instant reaction, free radical initiators may be 1 a combination of a chemical initiator and heat 2 ultraviolet light or 3 a combination ultraviolet light, heat and a chemical initiator. The chemical initiators can be any of the broad class of such compounds that generate carbon radicals, such as 1 peroxides this class includes the diacylperoxides such as diacetylperoxide and dibenzoylperoxide, 2 peroxyesters this class includes compounds such as the t butyl acetylperoxide and 3 azo compounds this class of compounds includes phenylazotriphenylmethane and 2,2 azo bis 2 methylpropionitrile AIBN . The heat supplied to initiate the reaction in which a chemical initiator is used should be in the range from between about 400 to about 1300C. This heat is conveniently supplied by refluxing solvents such as benzene boiling point 80.10C , dimethoxyethane boiling point 850C , and toluene boiling point 1100C , The ultraviolet light source used to initiate the reaction can be any commercially available source, preferably those used for photochemical applications. The term substantially anhydrous as used in the present description means that, although anhydrous organic solvents are generally preferred, trace amounts of water, such as that often found in commercially available solvents, can be tolerated. The presence of such trace amounts of water can be compensated by using additional amounts of the chemical free radical initiator, the allyl tin reagent IV , and the starting material If . It is preferred that conventional laboratory techniques be employed to dry the solvents and to exclude moisture from the solvent. For instance, benzene can be distilled to give anhydrous benzene, and dimethoxyethane can be refluxed over sodium or sodiumpotassium alloy then distilled to yield the anhydrous compound. The term aromatic hydrocarbon denotes benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, cumene, o ,m, p xylene, mesitylene and like compounds. The term substantially inert atmosphere refers to gases such as nitrogen and argon. Preferably, the argon or nitrogen is first passed through a drying column before it is used over the reaction mixture. In the above process of Scheme I it is preferred that an approximately 1 molar solution of the azetidinone II be used. The allyl tin reagent IV should preferably be present in about 3 molar equivalents per equivalent of starting material II used.When the combination of heat and a chemical initiator are used, the preferred temperature for the reaction is from between about 700C to about 1300C, The preferred chemical initiators are the azo class of compounds, especially AIBN. It is preferred that only a catalytic amount of the chemical initiator be used, however greater quantities can be used if deemed necessary to promote the reaction. The solvents for the above process are preferably dried before use and are pre ferably benzene and dimethoxyethane. The order of the addition of reagents and starting materials is not critical, but it is preferred that the starting material II be first dissolved in the solvent, the allyl tin reagent IV added, the mixture is heated followed by the addition of the chemical initiator.Alternatively, the last step could be irradiation of the mixture with ultraviolet light. A positive pressure of nitrogen or argon should be maintained throughout the entire reaction so as to exclude moisture and oxygen. The progress of the instant process can be monitored in a conventional manner, such as by thin layer chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography, or by analyzing small aliquots of the reaction mixture spectroscopically. The instant process is generally complete in about 1 to 3 hours, but this figure varies with the type and amount of substrate and reagent, the solvent and the temperature used, among other variables. The 4 R,S allyl or substituted allyl azetidinone compounds III produced by the present process can be isolated and purified by conventional laboratory techniques including extraction, crystal lization and recrystallization, trituration and chromatography. An important feature of the instant process is that varying amounts of cis and trans isomers at the 3 and 4 positions of the products III can be obtained by varying the group at R5. An illustration of the effect of the R5 substituent on the stereochemistry of the product III is demonstrated below by the reaction depicted in Table 1. Table 1 Effect of Rg on Stereoselectivity of the ReactionEMI24.1 Product ratio Rg trans cis t butoxycarbonyl 100 0 benzoyl 85 15 benzyloxycarbonyl 50 50 2 phenylacetyl 50 50 2 phenoxyacetyl 50 50 allyloxycarbonyl 30 70 The controllable stereoselectivity at C 3 andC 4 of the products III of the process affords an efficient synthesis of 6 aminocarbapenem and monobactam antibiotics. At the positions corresponding to 3 and 4 in the product III , the desired configuration of these antibiotics is 5R,6S for the carbapenems and 3S,4R or 3S,4S for the monobactams.

The synthesis of 4 R,S chloro, bromo, substituted thio or substituted selenyl azetidinone starting materials formula II, Scheme I above from penicillins and or cephalosporins is discussed below.Encompassed in this discussion is the synthesis of the 4 R,S substituted selenyl azetidinone starting materials represented by formula I. The synthesis of the starting materials will be discussed in two general parts. First, the synthesis of compounds wherein R10 is a group of the formula Se R11 or S R11 i.e., the 4 R,S substituted thio and substituted selenyl azetidinone compounds will be discussed.Second, the synthesis of compounds wherein R10 is chloro or bromo i.e., the 4 R,S chloro or bromo azetidinones will be discussed. A. Synthesis of 4 R,S substituted thio and sub stituted selenyl azetidinone starting materials The synthesis of the 4 R,S substituted thio and substituted selenyl azetidinone starting materials is conveniently discussed in 3 parts 1 synthesis of 4 S acetoxyazetidinone precursors 2 synthesis of starting materials wherein R8 is hydrogen or an amino protecting group and 3 synthesis of starting materials wherein R8 is the seco penicillin moiety. The 4 S acetoxy azetidinone precursors, wherein the ring nitrogen is substituted by hydrogen, an amino protecting group or the seco penicillin moiety will be discussed as one group. The 4 R,S sub stituted thio or substituted selenyl azetidinone starting materials will be discussed in two parts 1 wherein the azetidinone ring nitrogen is substituted with hydrogen or amino protecting group 2 wherein the ring nitrogen is substituted with a seco penicillin moiety. 1, Synthesis of 4 S acetoxyazetidinone precursors. The synthesis of 4 S acetoxyazetidinone precursors is outlined below in Diagram A Diagram AEMI34.1 In Diagram A, R5, and Rj are the same as for 3 the corresponding numbers of the compounds in Scheme I. Y is 0 or 1. R5 a is the same as R5 with the deletion from Rf of the groups C1 to C6 alkoxy, allyloxy, phenoxy, benzyloxy and 4 methoxybenzyloxy. R5b is R5 only whenRf is C1 to C6 alkoxy, allyloxy, phenoxy, benzyloxy, or 4 methoxybenzyloxy. Finally, the symbol Q represents an amino protecting group as defined for any of the compounds above. Referring to Diagram A, the 5 membered ring of a SS,GR penicillin sulfide 1 or a 5S,6R penicillin sulfoxide 2 can be cleaved to give the 4 acetoxyazetidinone 3 . Specifically, the penicillin sulfide 1 is treated with an excess of mercuric acetate in a solvent such as acetic acid at 1000C under an inert atmosphere.The conversion of the sulfide 1 to the 4 acetoxyazetidinone 3 under those conditions can take as little as 15 minutes. The 5 membered ring of the penicillin sulfoxide 2 is cleaved under well known conditions.For instance, under an inert atmosphere, the 4 acetoxyazetidinone 3 is obtained by treating the sulfoxide 2 with trimethylphosphite 2.5 equivalents and acetic acid 7.5 equivalents in refluxing toluene. The 4 acetoxyazetidinone compound 6 can be synthesized by one of two routes. In the first route, the 4 acetoxyazetidinone N seco penicillin derivative 3 is treated with an equimolar amount of potassium permanganate in an acetone water solvent at room temperature. The second route involves the intermediate steps of amide side chain cleavage followed by reacylation with the RSb side chain. The side chain cleavage step involves methods well known in the art. For example, the triphenylphosphite chlorine pyridine kinetic complex, described in Bunnel, U.S. Patent No. 4,223,133 issued September 16., 1980, can be employed.This method entails bubbling chlorine gas through a halogenated hydrocarbon such as methylene chloride at a temperature around 35 C until a yellow color persists. This color is titrated away by the addition of triphenylphosphite.The substrate 3 is added followed by the addition of sufficient pyridine to complex the newly formed kinetic species. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature until completion. The mixture is then cooled to approximately lO0C, hydrogen chloride gas is bubbled through the mixture for short period, followed by the addition of iso butyl alcohol. This mixture is stirred for approximately 1.5 hours to give the amine hydrochloride salt 4 . The amine hydrochloride salt 4 is then acylated with a urethan amino protecting group using standard methods known in the art. Such methods are described in the Greene and McOmie references cited above under the definitions of an aminoprotecting group. For example, the substrate 4 is combined with di t butyl dicarbonate in tetrahydrofuran followed by the immediate addition of solid sodium bicarbonate. This reaction is stirred at room temperature until completion to give the 3 S t butoxycarbonylamino compound, a species of the class of 3 S acylated 4 S acetoxyazetidinone N secopenicillin compounds 5 . The seco penicillin moiety of the reacylated azetidinone 5 is removed by dissolving the substrate in a 1 1 methylene chloride methanol solution, cooling the solution to 740C, and bubbling ozone through the solution until it takes on a bluish tinge. At the end of the addition of the ozone, nitrogen is used to purge the solution. To quench the reaction, dimethylsulfide is added to the solution. The last reaction depicted above in Diagram A, the conversion of the N H compound 6 to the N protected amino compound 7 , is carried out by standard methods used for protecting amino groups in the ss lactam art. For instance, the ring nitrogen can be silylated with the tri methyl silyl group as follows the substrate 6 is mixed in methylene chloride with bis trimethyl silyl trifluoroacetamide 5.0 equivalents under nitrogen. In an alternative procedure, the substrate 6 is added to tetrahydrofuran followed by the addition of triethylamine. This reaction mixture is cooled to OOC and tri methyl silyl chloride is added.Both of these procedures result in the N trimethylsilyl compound 7 t is trimethylsilyl . In a similar fashion, the ring nitrogen is silylated with the t butyl dimethylsilyl group by dissolving the substrate 6 and t butyl dimethylsilyl chloride in acetonitrile, followed by the addition of triethylamine to the solution. 2. Synthesis of N H, N 4 R,S substituted selenyl or substituted thio azetidinones The 4 S acetoxyazetidinone precursors substituted at nitrogen with a hydrogen 6 or an amino protecting group 7 in Diagram A are converted to the corresponding 4 R,S substituted selenyl or substituted thioazetidinone compounds as outlined inDiagram B. Diagram BEMI38.1 In the above Diagram B, R5, R11, and are the same as in Diagram A. The replacement of the acetoxy group in the precursor 7 by a substituted thiol or substituted selenyl group to give the corresponding starting material 9 is accomplished with two general methods. The first method involves reacting the precursor 7 with boron trifluoride etherate and the appropriate substituted selenol or substituted thiol in methylene chloride at low temperature approximately OOC in an inert atmosphere. The second route synthesizes the 4 R,S substituted selenyl compounds. Selenium metal is first dissolved in tetrahydrofuran. The appropriate alkyl or aryllithium reagent is added to the solution and the solution is cooled to approximately 500C. The substrate is added and the reaction is stirred under nitrogen until substantially complete. The reaction is quenched by adding a 2M solution of acetic acid in tetrahydrofuran. The 4 S acetoxyazetidinone N H compounds 6 are converted to the 4 R,S substituted thio or substituted selenyl azetidinone N H compound 8 by the second route discussed for the conversion of the cor responding N 4 azetidinones 7 to 9 . The interconversion of the N H and NgD 4 R,S acetoxyazetidinones 6 to 7, 7 to 6 and the N H and N commat 4 R,S substituted thio or substituted selenyl azetidinones 8 to 9, 9 to 8 is accomplished by methods well known in the art. For example, the azeti dinone ring nitrogen can be protected as discussed above in Diagram A e.g., 6 to 7 . Furthermore, the nitrogen is sometimes deprotected during the workup of the product 9 . For example, when is trimethylsilyl on the 4 R,S substituted thio or substituted selenyl azetidinone 9 , the compound is deprotected to give the corresponding N H compound 8 on contact with silica gel or moisture. 3. Synthesis of N seco penicillin 4 R,S substituted selenyl azetidinones The 4 S acetoxyazetidinones substituted on the azetidinone ring nitrogen with a seco penicillin moiety Diagram A, compounds 3 and 5 are converted to the corresponding 4 R, S substituted selenyl azetidinones 11 as represented in Diagram C Diagram CEMI41.1 RSa R5b, R5, R11, and Rj have the same meanings as they do for the terms in Diagram A above. At this point it is useful to recall that R5b stands for Rf when Rf is only C1 to C6 alkoxy, allyloxy, phenoxy, benzyloxy, and 4 methoxybenzyloxy.On the other hand, R5 a is Rf when R represents everything except C1 to C6 alkoxy, allyloxy, phenoxy, benzyloxy, and 4 methoxy benzyloxy. In Diagram C, the deacylation reacylation of 3 to give 5 is carried out identically to the procedure described for these compounds in Diagram A. The 4 S acetoxyazetidinone precursors 5, 3 are converted to the corresponding 4 R,S substituted selenyl azetidinone starting materials 10 by either of the two routes outlined for the conversion of the 4 S acetoxyazetidinone NgD compounds 7 to the 4 R,S substituted selenyl azetidinone NgD compounds 9 in Diagram B above. B. Synthesis of 4 R,S Chloro or Bromo AzetidinoneStarting Materials 4 R, S chloro or bromo azetidinone starting materials are synthesized from penicillin sulfones and 3 methyl cephalosporin sulfones as outlined in Diagram D Diagram DEMI43.1 In Diagram D, R5, R6, Rj, and have the same meaning as described for Diagrams A, B, and C above. In the specific reactions in Diagram D, the penicillin sulfone 11 is cleaved to the 4 sulfinic acid azetidinone 13 with a hindered amine base.The preferred base is 1,8 diazabicyclot5.4.0 undec 7 ene DBU . For example, 5R,SS 6 phenylacetamido 6 methoxypeni cillin l sulfone is dissolved in methylene chloride and the solution cooled to 0 C. One equivalent of DBU is added and the mixture is stirred at low temperature for 30 minutes to give the corresponding 4 sulfinlc acid azetidinone 13 . The 3 methylcephalosporin sulfone 12 is cleaved to the 4 sulfinic acid azetidinone 13 with ammonium chloride and zinc. For example, under a nitrogen atmosphere, benzyl 7S,6R 7 phenoxyacetamido 7 methoxy 3 methyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylate sulfone is dissolved in a 10 1 ethanol methylene chloride solution. Ammonium chloride 18 equivalents and activated zinc metal approximately 19 equivalents is added and the mixture is stirred at room temperature overnight. This reaction gave a mixture of a,ss and ,y isomers on the seco penicillin tail of the azetidinone 13 . The 4 R,S chloro or bromo azetidinones 14 are synthesized by reacting the corresponding 4 sulfinic acid azetidinones 13 with N chlorosuccinimide or N bromosuccinimide, respectively. Additionally, t butyl hypochlorite or N chlorophthalimide can be used to make the 4 chloro derivative. For example, a 4 sulfinic acid azetidinone 13 wherein R6 is methoxy, R5 and the nitrogen taken together are phenylacetamido, and R. is 3 benzyl is dissolved in methylene chloride, the solution cooled to 540C and about 1 equivalent of t butylhypochlorite is added to the solution. The solution is stirred at low temperature for less than an hour. The reaction is quenched by extracting the solution with a 1N sodium thiosulfate solution. An example of the bromination procedure entails dissolving a 4 sulfinic acid azetidinone 13 wherein R6 is methoxy, R5 and the nitrogen taken together are phenoxyacetamido and Rj is benzyl in methylene chloride under nitrogen. The solution cooled to OOC, N bromosuccinimide 2 equivalents is added and the solution is stirred for approximately 1 hour. The reaction is quenched by adding a 1N solution of sodium thiosulfate to the solution. The N seco penicillin 4 R, S chloro or bromo azetidinone 14 is a suitable substrate for reaction in the process of Scheme I. However, theN seco penicillin moiety can be removed to give theN H species 15 as a substrate for the same process.The seco penicillin moiety can be removed by the ozonolysis methanolysis procedure or the potassium permanganate acetone water procedure discussed inDiagram A the conversion of compounds 5 to 6 and 3 to 6, respectively . Similarly, the N H compound is a suitable substrate in the process outlined by Scheme I above, but this compound can be converted to the corresponding N amino protected compound 16 in a conversion analogous to that described above in Diagram A 6 to 7 . III. THE NOVEL PROCESS SYNTHESIS OF 4 R,S 2 SUBSTITUTED OR UNSUBSTI TUTED ALLYL AZETIDINONES WITH 2 SUBSTITUTED OR UNSUBSTITuLED ALLYL TIN COMPOUNDSUNDER FREE RADICAL CONDITIONS The process of the instant invention is depicted generally above in Scheme I. The discussion of the process is divided in parts based on the substituents on the azetidinone ring nitrogen of the starting materials and the products. In one part of the process, the substituent on the azetidinone nitrogen R8 is hydrogen or an aminoprotecting group. This part of the process is represented in Diagram E Diagram EEMI47.1 In Diagram E, R51 R61 R71 R91 and t have the same meaning as defined in Scheme I. R10 a is the same as Rlo above. Note, however, that when R6 is methoxy, Rioa is other than substituted selenyl or substituted thio. R7x encompasses all of the groups defined by R7 except for the protected carboxy methyl group. Rx represents a carboxy protecting group as defined above. The 4 R,S substituted thio and substituted selenyl azetidinone starting materials 8, 9 inDiagram E are synthesized according to the scheme ofDiagram B. The 4 R,S chloro or bromo azetidinones starting materials 15, 16 are synthesized according to the route outlined in Diagram D. Note in Diagram E that the products are arbitrarly divided based on the differences in the substituent R7. Thus, there is a class of products wherein R7 is protected carboxy methyl 18, 20 and a class where R7 is R7x, i.e., all of the groups encompassed by R7 except the protected carboxy methyl group.The process described in Diagram E produces the products represented by formula V above. The second part of the process employs starting materials wherein the azetidinone ring nitrogen is substituted with the seco penicillin moiety. This synthetic scheme is shown in Diagram F Diagram FEMI49.1 In Diagram F, R5, R6, R7, R9, Rj, R7 and Rx have the same meanings as defined in diagram E.Rob stands for chloro, bromo, or, when R6 is other than methoxy, a group of the formula Se R11 The starting materials in Diagram F are the 4 R,S substituted selenyl azetidinones 10 ofDiagram C and the 4 R,S chloro or bromo azetidinones 14 of Diagram D. In Diagram F, an arbitrary distinction is drawn among the products based on differences of R7. As with Diagram E, the products are divided into two groups based on differences in R7 wherein R7 is a protected carboxy methyl group 22 and all other substituents that R7 may be other than a protected carboxy methyl group R7Xr 21 . The reaction conditions for Diagrams E and F are discussed above in conjunction with Scheme I. Compound IV of Scheme I, the 2 substituted or unsubstituted allyl tin reagent , or simply the tin reagent , can be synthesized in one of two ways. In the first method, bis trialkyl or triaryl tin oxide and a 2 substituted or unsubstituted allyl Grignard reagent are reacted. This reaction is depicted generally in Diagram G Diagram GEMI50.1 In Diagram G, R9 is the same as defined forScheme I. 7X is the same as defined for Diagram F except that it does not include the protected carboxy methyl group. The conditions of the reaction in Diagram G usually involve generating the Grignard reagent in situ.Under a nitrogen atmosphere, magnesium metal is placed in diethyl ether and activated with iodine. The 2 unsubstituted or substituted allyl bromide is added and the mixture is refluxed for about 0.5 hours to about 1.5 hours. Bis trialkyl or triaryl tin oxide 0.5 equivalents per equivalent of Grignard reagent present is added and the solution is refluxed for approximately 1 hour. The second and more general method involves reacting a trialkyl or triaryl tin hydride with a 2 substituted or unsubstituted 3 alkyl or aryl substituted sulfide, sulfoxide, or sulfone allyl moiety. This reaction is outlined in Diagram I. Diagram IEMI51.1 In Diagram I, R7 and R9 are as defined above for Scheme I. Z is equal to 0, 1 or 2 and W is phenyl or C1 to C6 alkyl. The reaction of Diagram I generally is run under an inert atmosphere in an aromatic hydrocarbon solvent such as toluene. The trialkyl or triaryl tin hydride and the allyl moiety are combined in the solvent and the reaction is initiated by a chemical initiator such as AIBN and by a U.V. light source. IV. SYNTHETIC USES FOR THE PRODUCTS OF THE PROCESS A. Introduction The products of the process of Scheme I, represented by compound III, can be converted to two classes of antibiotic compounds 1 The carbapenems of formula VI EMI52.1 In formula VI, R5 is as defined in Scheme I,Ry is a carboxy protecting group, hydrogen or a pharmaceutically acceptable carboxylic acid salt forming cation and X is a wide variety of carbon, sulfur and oxygen substituents, specifically the acetoxy group. 2 The monobactamsr specifically monobactams of formula VII EMI53.1 In the above formula VII, Re and R7 are as defined in Scheme I. B. Synthesis of carbapenems The synthesis of carbapenems formula VI is carried out with the products of the present novel process 17 through 20, Diagram E and 21 and 22,Diagram F, collectively referred to in this section as products when R7 the allyl substituent on the products is either hydrogen or the protected carboxy methyl group, and R6 is hydrogen. Specifically, compounds 18, 20, and 22 R7 is protected carboxy methyl only and compound 17, 19, and 21 R7x is hydrogen only are useful in the synthesis of carbapenems referred to in this section as final products 1 . 1 Route 1 Starting Materials 18 and 20 of Diagram E R7 is protected carboxy methyl Synthetic Route 1 affords the desired carbapenems. Route 1 employs starting materials with the allyl group at C 4 of the azetidinone moiety substituted with protected carboxy methyl 18 and 20, Diagram E .This reaction sequence is outlined below in Diagram J Route 1 Diagram JEMI55.1 In the above Diagram J, R5 is as defined above for Scheme I. Rx is a carboxy protecting group as defined above. t indicates an amino protecting group as defined above. Ry is a carboxy protecting group, hydrogen or a pharmaceutically acceptable carboxylic acid salt forming cation. In the individual reactions in Diagram Jr the conversion of the amino protected 4 R,S 2 protected carboxy methyl allyl azetidinone 20 to the corresponding N H compound 18 is accomplished with standard amino protecting group removal conditions. Such conditions are outlined in references such as McOmie and T.W. Greene, discussed above in conjunction with the definition of amino protecting groups The 4 R,S 2 protected carboxy methyl allyl azetidinone 18 is ozonized to the 4 R,S B ketoester azetidinone 23 under nitrogen in a 1 1 methanol methylene chloride solution at low temperature e.g. 780C . After the starting material 18 has been added to the methanol methylene chloride mixture and the mixture cooled, ozone is bubbled through the mixture until a blueish tinge results. The mixture is purged with nitrogen, warmed to room temperature then quenched with dimethylsulfide. The 4 R,S B ketoester azetidinone 23 is then subjected to standard diazo transfer reaction conditions to give the 4 R,S B ketoester diazo azetidinone 24 . These conditions entail dissolving a substrate 23 in a polar aprotic solvent, such as acetonitrile, under nitrogen. Para carboxyphenyl sulfonazide is then added, followed by the addition of an amine base such as triethylamine. The mixture is stirred at room temperature until the reaction is complete. The 4 R,S ss ketoester diazo azetidinone 24 is a precursor to an annelation process using a diazo insertion reaction. This reaction yields a 3 ketocarbapenam 25 . More specifically, under nitrogen a catalytic amount of the rhodium acetate dimer is dissolved in benzene and the mixture is refluxed. The substrate 24 is added and the resultant mixture is refluxed for 1 hour then stirred at room temperature for 2 days. The 3 ketocarbapenam 25 is converted to the corresponding 3 acetoxycarbapenem 26 by acylating the 3 enolate form of 25. For instance, under argon the substrate 25 is dissolved in methylene chloride and the solution cooled to low temperature e.g. OOC . Acetyl chloride 1 equivalent and pyridine are sequentially added and the reaction mixture is stirred at low temperature OOC for 1.5 hours then at room temperature for 1.5 hours to effect the acylation. 2 Route 2 Starting materials 17, 19 of Diagram E R7 is hydrogen Route 2 starts with the compounds of Diagram E 17, 19 wherein R6 is hydrogen, R8 is an amino protecting group or hydrogen, and R7 is hydrogen. Route 2 gives a 4 R,S ss ketoester azetidinone 23 of Route 1. In Route 1, the 4 R,S ss ketoester azetidinone 23 is taken on to the final carbapenems 26, Diagram J .Route 2 Intermediates Diagram KEMI58.1 In Diagram K, R5 and are as defined inRoute 1, Diagram J. Referring to the specific reactions inDiagram K, the amino protected 4 R,S allyl azetidinone 19A is oxidized with osmium tetroxide to the corresponding 4 R,S 1 ,22 dihydroxyprop 3l yl azetidinone 27 . The reaction proceeds under a nitrogen atmosphere wherein 4 methylmorpholine 4 oxide is dissolved in deionized water acetone 2 1 and a t butanol solution of osmium tetroxide is added. The substrate is added and the reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature until the reaction is substantially complete. The amino protected 4 R,S 1 ,2 dihydroxy prop 3 yl azetidinone 27 is converted to the N protected 4 R,S 1 oxoeth 2 yl azetidinone 28 with an oxidative loss of carbon. The starting material 27 is dissolved in an aromatic hydrocarbon, such as benzene, under nitrogen. An excess of lead tetraacetate e.g., 1.5 equivalents is added and the reaction solution is stirred at room temperature until substantially complete approximately 1.5 hours . The conditions outlined above for the aminoprotected compounds 19A, 27 and 28 also apply to the corresponding N H compounds 17A, 29 and 30 . The removal of the amino protecting groups to give the analogous N H compounds occurs under standard aminoprotecting group removal conditions. Subroute 2A 6 S carbapenems Subroute 2A produces the final carbapenems from starting materials 30 and 28. The reaction sequence for Subroute 2A is outlined generally in the following Diagram L Subroute 2A Diagram LEMI60.1 In Diagram L, R5, Rx and are as defined for Route 1, Diagram J. The amino protected 4 R,S l oxoeth 2 yl azetidinone 28 is converted to the corresponding free amine compound 30 by standard methods for removing amino protecting groups. The diastereomers of the 4 R,S l oxoeth2 yl azetidinone mixture are separated by standard chromatography techniques such as chromatography ofActivity III silica gel, eluting with a gradient of toluene to 80 ethyl acetate toluene . The 3 S 4 R l oxoeth 2 yl azetidinone cis diastereomer 37 is isolated and is converted to the 3 S 4 R trans t butyl but 2 en 4 yloate azetidinone 38 using theHorner Emmons modification of the Wittig reaction. This modification reacts t butyl 2 dimethylphosphonato acetate ylid with the substrate 37 . The 3 S 4 R p ketoester azetidinone 23 is obtained from the 3 S 4 R trans t butyl but 2 en 4 yloate azetidinone 38 by an oxypallidation procedure in which sodium tetrachloropalladate and excess t butylhydroperoride are dissolved in an aqueous acidic solvent such as 50 aqueous acetic acid.The substrate 38 is added and the reaction mixture is heated until the reaction is substantially complete. The 3 S 4 R B ketoester azetidinone 23 is taken on to the final carbapenems according to the synthesis described in Route 1, Diagram J above. 3 Route 3 Starting Materials 21 and 22 of Diagram F Synthetic Route 3 employs starting materials with a N seco penicillin moiety. Synthetic Route 3 will be discussed in three parts 1 the intermediates of Route 3 2 Subroute 3A, wherein R7 is protected carboxy methyl 3 Subroute 3B, wherein R7 is hydrogen. a Route 3 Intermediates The intermediates of Subroutes 3A and 3B are discussed together below. These intermediates are analogs that differ only at the Rv substituent, which is either hydrogen or protected carboxy methyl. The synthesis of the intermediates is outlined below inDiagram M Route 3 Common Intermediates Diagram MEMI63.1 In Diagram M, R5 and R are the same as defined for Route 1, Diagram J. Rj is the same as described for that symbol in Scheme I. The following discussion describes the conversion of the intermediates where R7 is hydrogen 21 to 41 to 37 . The same conditions apply to the conversion of the analogs wherein R7 is protected carboxy methyl 22 to 43 to 23 . N seco penicillin 4 R,S allyl azetidinone 21 is converted sequentially to the N glyoxamido 4 R,S l oxoeth 21 yl azetidinone 41 then to the free amine 4 R,S l oxoeth 2 yl azetidinone 37 in a one pot, ozonolysis methanolysis procedure. The substrate 21 is dissolved under nitrogen in a 1 1 methanol methylene chloride solution. The solution is cooled to very low temperature approximately 740C and ozone is bubbled through the solution until a blueish tinge results approximately 20 minutes to 1 hour .

The reaction conditions for this reaction are the Horner Emmons modification of theWittig procedure, as described earlier. 4 R,S trans t butyl but 2 en 4 yloate azetidinone undergoes oxypallidation, as described earlier, to give the 4 R,S B ketoester azetidinone 23 . The 4 R,S 8 ketoester azetidinone 23 is part of Route 1, Diagram J. The reactions associated with Route 1 take compound 23 to a 3 acetoxycarbapenem. C Synthesis of monobactams The synthesis of monobactam compounds VII proceeds from the products of the process in Scheme I.Specifically, product compound 21 of Diagram F is the beginning of the monobactam synthesis. Compound 21 is eventually converted to product compound 19 prior to the synthesis of a monobactam. Alternatively, the synthesis can start with compound 17 Diagram E which is converted to 19. For convenience sake, the discussion of the synthesis of monobactams will be divided into two parts 1 monobactams precursors and 2 monobactams final products. 1 Monobactams Precursors The precursors to monobactam like compounds all are substituted on the 3 S nitrogen with the R5a group. This group is the same as R5 except that Rf is not C1 to C6 alkoxy, allyloxy, phenoxy, benzyloxy and 4 methoxybenzyloxy. The synthesis of the precursors is outlined below in Diagram P Monobactam Precursors Diagram PEMI69.1 In Diagram P, R5 a is as described above. R6 is hydrogen or methoxy and R7x includes R7 except the protected carboxy methyl group. R. is a carboxy 3 protecting group as described for the above Scheme I. is an amino protecting group as that is defined above for various compounds. In the individual reactions of Diagram P, the N seco penicillin 4 R, S substituted or unsubstituted allyl azetidinone 21 is taken sequentially to the N glyoxamido 4 R, S substituted or unsub stituted 2 oxoeth 1 yl azetidinone 44 and then to the free amine 4 R,S substituted or unsubstituted 2 oxoeth l yl azetidinone 45 with a one pot ozonolysis methanolysis procedure. The 4 R,S substituted or unsubstituted 2 oxoeth 1 yl azetidinone 45 is converted to the corresponding amino protected derivative 46 by standard amino protecting group procedures, as discussed in the above McOmie and Greene references. A standard Wittig reaction converts the amino protected 4 R,S substituted or unsubstituted 2 oxoeth l yI azetidinone 46 to the corresponding 4 R, S substituted or unsubstituted allyl azetidinone 19 . The Wittig procedure entails dissolving methyl bromide and triphenylphosphine in a dry aprotic polar solvent such as dimethylformamide, dimethyfsulfoxide, tetrahydrofuran, or dimethoxyethane under a nitrogen atmosphere. A strong base, such as N butyllithium or sodium hydride, is added to the cooled solution and the solution is stirred from 20 C to about 250C for 0.5 to 2.0 hours. The substrate is added and the solution is heated to effect the Wittig reaction. An alternative Route to product compound 19 starts with product compound 17. The free amine 4 R,S 2 substituted or unsubstituted allyl azetidinone 17 is converted to the amino protected derivative 19 by standard amino protecting group procedures. 2 Monobactams Final Products Product compound 19 from the above precursor synthesis is taken on to monobactam like final products VII, 50 . The synthesis of these products proceeds as follows 1 side chain cleavage at the C 3 nitrogen 2 reacylation of the C 3 amino group with an urethan forming amino protecting group 3 sulfonation of the azetidinone ring nitrogen 4 deprotection of the C 3 amino group and 5 reacylation of the C 3 amino group with an 2 2 aminothiazol 4 yl 2 Z alkoxyimino acetyl moiety. In the following Diagram, all compounds are indicated to be a diastereomeric mixture at C 4. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the diastereomers of these compounds can be separated at any stage and used to give the preferred 3S,4S isomer of monobactam. The synthesis of monobactam final products is outlined below in Diagram Q Monobactam Final Products Diagram QEMI72.1 The term A stands for an anion such as the chloride or bromide anion. The term M represents an organic or inorganic cation such as the sodium ion, the potassium ion, or the tetra n butyl ammonium ion. R61 , R7 a R5a are as defined above for Diagram P. R5b represents R5 when Rf is only C1 to C6 alkoxy, allyloxy, phenoxy, benzyloxy, or 4 methyloxybenzyloxy. Turning to the specific reactions of Diagram Q, the amino protected 4 R,S substituted or unsubstituted allyl azetidinone 19 is converted to the nucleus 3 S amino 4 R,S substituted or unsubstituted allyl azetidinone amine salt 47 using a standard penicillin or cephalosporin side chain cleavage reaction. One such reaction uses triphenylphos phite chlorine pyridine kinetic complex, followed by cleavage of the imino chloride thus formed with hydrogen chloride gas and isobutanol. This reaction is analogous to the one described for the conversion of compound 3 to compound 4 in Diagram A above. The 3 S amino 4 R,S substituted, unsubstituted allyl azetidinone amine salt 47 is reacylated with a urethan forming amino protecting group to give the corresponding 3 S urethan 4 R, S substituted or unsubstituted allyl azetidinone 19 . The allyloxycarbonyl, alkyloxycarbonyl, phenoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, etc. groups are acylated onto the 3 S amino nucleus using standard acylation techniques, especially those techniques used for forming urethan amino protecting groups. For instance, di t butyl dicarbonate and the starting material 19 are combined in tetrahydrofuran followed by the immediate addition of sodium bicarbonate. This reaction is analogous to the acylation of compound 4 to give compound 5, Diagram A, above. The amino protected 4 R, S substituted or unsubstituted allyl azetidinone 19 is deprotected to give the corresponding free amine compound 17 . The amino protecting group is removed with standard removal methods, as long as these methods do not result in the simultaneous cleavage of RSb For instance, the removal of the azetidinone ring amino protecting group using acid hydrolysis conditions would also remove a t butyl urethan group at the C 3 position of the azetidinone The free amine 4 R,S substituted or unsubstituted allyl azetidinone 17 is sulfonated to give the corresponding N sulfonate salt azetidinone 48 .Typical sulfonation conditions involve dissolving a base in aprotic polar solvent e.g picoline in dichloromethane under nitrogen. The solution is cooled to a low temperature e.g. OOC and chlorosulfonic acid is added. A methylene chloride solution of the substrate 17 is added dropwise to the cooled reaction mixture and the mixture is stirred at OOC for 2 to 3 days. The mixture is then neutralized and a counter ion, for example, tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate, is added to form the sulfonate salt. The urethan side chain at the C 3 position of the N sulfonate salt 4 R, S substituted or unsubstituted allyl azetidinone 48 is cleaved to give the corresponding N sulfonate 3 S amino 4 R, S sub stituted or unsubstituted allyl azetidinone zwitterion nucleus compound 49 . The cleavage of the urethan group at the C 3 position is accomplished using standard amino protecting group removal conditions. For example, when R5b is the t butoxycarbonyl group, the substrate 48 is dissolved in formic acid and stirred until the reaction is essentially complete, typically requiring 4 hours. The zwitterion compound from above 49 is acylated to give the monobactam derivative N sulfonate salt 3 S 2 2 aminothiazol 4 yl 2 Z methoxyimino acetamido 4 R,S substituted or unsubstituted allyl azetidinone 50 . The zwitterion is acylated using standard acylating conditions, such as with the acid chloride, a mixed acid anhydride, or as the free acid in the presence of a dehydrating agent such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. For example, the zwitterion 49 is placed in a polar solvent mixture such as 2 1 acetone water, and the pH of the resultant solution is adjusted to render the 3 S amino group nucleophilic. Typically the pH of the solution is taken to 9. The isobutyl mixed anhydride derivative of the 2 2 amino thiazol 4 yl 2 Z methoxyimino acetyl group is added and the reaction stirred until essentially complete.Compound 50 is isolated as the salt of the base that is used to raise the pH of the substrate solution. The final products of the above synthetic routes, the carbapenem compounds VI and the monobactam compounds VII , are antibiotics. For example, a carbapenem of formula VI wherein R5 was phenoxyacetyl, Ry was methyl, and X was acetoxy, showed activity against a strain of Micrococcus luteus and a strain of Bacillus subtilis in a standard disc plate assay. Monobactam compounds of the formula VII are known to have activity against a variety of grampositive and gram negative bacteria and also known to possess B lactamase inhibitory activities. A discussion of the biological properties of the compounds of formulaVII can be found in U.K. Patent Application No.2,091,724 A, published August 4, 1982.
