# COMPUTER CONTROL SYSTEM

## Abstract
A computer control system, especially a flight control computer system, comprises a series of computer modules operating in parallel and asynchronously to carry out respective parts of an overall control algorithm for a series of items to be controlled, each computer module having a data transmission port connected via a broadcast line to a respective input port of each other computer module so that communication between modules is achieved by any of the modules broadcasting asynchronous data messages onto its broadcast line for the messages to be received by any other modules which require them.
