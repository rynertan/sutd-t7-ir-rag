## Description
CROSSi3OW The present invention relates to a crossbow. According to the invention the main feature of the weapon or crossbow is that a projectile or slug is propelled through the interior of an optionally rifled tube or barrel. A projectile propelling element is guided by the barrel interior and is brought to a loading position by a conventional mechanism. The firing mechanism and the loading mechanism are very simple. The crossbow in accordance with this specification is fitted to a conventional stock which also serves as a butt for holding against the user s shoulder. The stock receives the firing mechanisms and serves as a base for the barrel of the weapon and for the conventional lateral bow elements which drive the cable of the weapon on the stock. The same also comprises a conventional lever system acting on the propelling elements against the force of the cable and bow elements. As previously stated, the stock receives a barrel which can be any shape externally and which may or may not be rifled internally and which has two sharply differentiated zones, these being a rear zone associated with the stock in the zone receiving the firing means, and a front zone. The rear zone of the barrel is formed with at least one longitudinal groove and the front zone is completely enclosed. The length of the rcar zone of the barrel corresponds substantially to the end operative positions of the coventional lever system of a conventional crossbow, and a cylindrical propelling element receiving the cable connected to the lateral bow elements of the crossbow moves inside the rear zone of the barrel, in which zone the barrel is formed with a transverse aperture through which a projectile can be placed inside the barrel when the weapon has been prepared for firing. The loading mechanism is the actual bow element and cable acting on the propelling element, the same being retained by a mechanism received in the stock.The latter mechanism comprises two members, one having a tooth engageable in a step or notch in the propelling element when rotated thereby, while the other member is connected to the toothed member and is triggeroperated to disengage the toothed member from the propelling element so that the projectile can be fired. The crossbow in accordance with the invention can be adapted to propel various kinds of projectile merely by minor modification of the barrel. This minor modification makes it possible to fire more than one projectile at a time, i.e. with a single actuation of the projectile propelling element. The crossbow in accordance with the invention is therefore very complete and versatile, as will become apparent from the detailed explanation given hereinafter. In one embodiment the barrel is formed at the top and throughout its length with a channel shaped to provide a slideway substantially parallel to the direction of the barrel interior. This slideway is preferably of semihexagonal cross section, being open at the top with an horizontal surface and two inclined lateral surfaces. The horizontal surface or base of the channel has a communication with the barrel interior, such communication being disposed perpendicularly to the barrel longitudinal axis and enabling a projectile to be introduced into the barrel as explained in principle in the opening, part of this description. Also, of course, the channel base is formed with an appropriately sized longitudinal opening through which the arm of the propelling element extends to the exterior. The length of the opening is determined by the travel of the propelling element, the same being actuated by the wire extending from the lateral springs or bow elements of the crossbow. By way of the opening the arm can move as far as the required position in accordance with the length and other characteristics of the crossbow. The longitudinal channel is adapted to receive a conventional dart or arrow or the like used in conventional crossbows, so that when the trigger is pulled the arm of the projectile propelling element can propel the arrow or the like, the same moving along the channel and being fired at the target. The weapon can also be used to fire a steel slug or ball inside the barrel by the internal cylindrical portion of the propelling element striking such ball or the like, the same having been introduced through the transverse communicating aperture in the base of the channel on top of the barrel. The crossbow can, in accordance with the invention, not only provide two different kinds of firing independently but can simultaneously fire a steel plug and a dart or arrow or the like. The invention is described in more detail with reference to the accompanying drawings in. which Figure 1 is a view of the crossbow in elevation Figure 2 is a plan view corresponding to Figure 1 Figure 3 is a cross section of the barrel on the line A A of Figure 2 Figure 4 is a section on the line B B of Figure 2 Figure 5 is a plan view of the projectilepropelling element Figure 6 is an enlarged longitudinal section through the crossbow and the rataining mechanism Figure 7 shows the external position of the retaining means Figure 8 shows the actuation of the retaining means and propelling element Figure 9 is a cross section through the barrel in accordance with the invention, in a vertical central plane of the projectile receiving aperture Figure 10 is a view of a conventional dart or arrow or the like in elevation Figure 11 is a section through the barrel near the firing zone in a longitudinal vertical plane, and Figure 12 is a view similar to Figure 11 but also showing the propelling device, a steel slug and a dart or arrow or the like. Referring to the drawings, there can be seen a stock 1 of a conventional crossbow the stock 1 has a front part 2 adapted to receive a barrel 5 and has an area where a trigger 3 is disposed. Bases. 12 of bow elements 13 are disposed on the sides of the stock 1 and have their ends connected to a metal cable 14. A conventional system of levers 6, 7, 8 is disposed above the stock 1. The end 8 is secured to the barrel 5 and arms 6, upon rotating, move a projectile propelling element 18 to which the cable 14 is connected. The propelling element 18 receives the cable 14 by way of an aperture 19 and the levers 6, 7 co operate with projecting pins or the like 20 of element 18 to bias the same into its retaining position. The element 18 is cylindrical and is received in a rear zone 4 of the barrel the pins or the like 20 extend to the exterior through longitudinal grooves 11 arranged to facilitate not only the guiding of the element 18 but also the pulling thereof by the lever7. The barrel 5 is formed in its rearward part 4 with an aperture 16 which extends transversely of the barrel longitudinal axis and through which a slug or projectile M can be inserted into barrel part 4. This introduction or loading step is carried out when the element 18 is in its fully back position, as shown inFigure 6. When the element 18 is moved back by the levers 6, 7, 8 and cable 14, it moves as far as the member 9 receiving the means or mechanisms for retaining the element 18. As the element 18 moves back, its rear end face 22 abuts the front end face of retaining member 24, which rotates around its point of rotation unreferenced in response to this actuation. When the member 24 rotates, the tooth 10 thereof engages in a step or notch or the like 21 in the element 18 to retain the same in its rear position. As it rotates, the member 24 acts on an auxiliary member 17 which is connected to the trigger 3, this combined action advancing the trigger 3. In the position shown in Figure 6, the element 18 is ready to fire the slug M. If the trigger 3 is now pulled, the member 12 is actuated, rotates and, in so doing, rotates the member 24 which disengages the tooth 10 from the notch 21 in the element 18. Front end face 23 thereof strikes the slug M to fire the same along the barrel 4, 5 to the exterior. Referring now to Figures 9 to 12, a barrel 25 has a hollow interior 26 in the cross section shown there can be seen a top channel 29 of the barrel 25, the channel 25 comprising a base unreferenced and side members 28, 28 . The channel 29 takes up the whole of the top part of the barrel 25 from the firing mechanism to the front of the barrel. The channel 29 serves as a way for a dart or arrow or the like 30 which is engaged in the channel 29 by way of its tail or flight 34 or the like and of its front part 32 disposed immediately behind its target striking portion 33. Channel 29 is formed in its base with a vertical aperture 27, through which the slug can be introduced from the exterior into the barrel interior 26, and with a longitudinal opening 31 through which arm 37 of the projectile propelling element can extend. The opening 31 does not extend over the whole length of the base of channel 29 but terminates at a distance from the barrel rear part. At its front end the opening 3i terminates in a place corresponding to the operative travel of the element 18 as determined by the lateral springs of the crossbow. The propelling element has a cylindrical bottom zone 35 adapted to contact the ball, the arm 37 via which the propelling element is guided along the opening 31, and a top portion 36 for receiving the cable connected to the lateral bow elements or springs or the like. As can be seen in Figure 12 there are three firing options for the crossbow, as follows I. Conventional firing just of the dart or arrow 30 in this case the dart 30 is placed in the channel 29 and when the weapon is fired the dart 30 is propelled by the part 37 of the propelling element II. Firing of a steel ball propelled by part 35 of the propelling element III. Simultaneous firing of a dart and a steel ball by the propelling element.
