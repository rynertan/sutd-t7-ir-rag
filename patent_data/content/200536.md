## Description
The invention relates generally to magnetic tape recording and or reproducing apparatus and more specifically to a head drum assembly for helical scan recording and or reproducing apparatus for magnetic tape. In such a head drum assembly it is desirable to eliminate wearing and or deterioration of the magnetic tape due to dust and grit which may collect on the magnetic tape surface. Helical scan magnetic tape recording and or reproducing apparatus, such as a video tape recorder VTR , employs a rotary head assembly having a rotary drum which supports magnetic heads. A magnetic tape is wrapped or wound around the periphery of the rotary head assembly. In general, when the apparatus is designed for both recording and reproduction, an erase head and a recording and play back head are installed on the periphery of the rotary drum. The magnetic tape wrapped around the periphery of the rotary drum assembly is fed between supply and take up reels while remaining in contact with the erase head and the recording and play back head. Since the erase head and the recording and play back head have rounded heads, they tend to leave gaps with the tape surface. Dust and grit thus tend to accumulate in those gaps and may form deposits on the magnetic tape surface. Accumulated dust and grit in those gaps disrupts the accurate spacing between the magnetic head and the tape surface and degrades the recording and reproducing characteristics of the apparatus or, in the worst case, may cause a drop out of recorded signals. Furthermore, dust and grit accumulating in the gaps tends to wear and damage the tape surface. Patent Specification GB A 2 070 841 discloses a helical scan recording and reproducing apparatus having a head drum assembly including a rotating drum around which a magnetic tape is wrapped and having magnetic heads set at different inclinations to one another to scan overlapping tracks of the tape. According to the invention there is provided a head drum assembly for a helical scan recording and or reproducing apparatus which includes a rotating drum about which magnetic tape is wrapped and for rotation relative to the magnetic tape, the assembly comprising a magnetic head supported by the rotating drum for recording data on the magnetic tape during rotation of the rotating drum Preferably, the sweeping means is an erase head. In the preferred embodiment, the sweeping means is made of Permalloy. The invention is diagrammatically illustrated by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Referring to the drawings and firstly to Figures 1 and 2, a rotary head assembly 1 generally comprises a stationary lower drum 2 and a rotary upper drum 3. The rotary upper drum 3 has a lower surface mating with the upper surface of the stationary lower drum 2 and has recesses 3 As will be seen from Figure 1, the rotary head assembly 1 is aligned with its axis oblique to an axis of tape feed. The rotary drum 3 is free to. rotate with the magnetic heads about the axis of the rotary head assembly. Therefore, the trace of the magnetic head shown by the arrow A across the magnetic tape T is oblique to the tape feed axis shown by the arrow B so as to define a series of oblique scanning tracks across the magnetic tape T, according to the well known helical scan technique. As shown in Figures 2 and 3, each of the magnetic heads 4 The sweeper members 7 The rotary drum is driven to rotate in the direction A indicated in Figure 4 and at the same time, the magnetic tape T is driven in the direction B as shown in Figures 4 A and 4 B for recording and reproduction. The rotation speed of the rotary drum 3 is essentially higher than the feed rate of the magnetic tape T according to the helical scan technique. During scanning, the sweeper members 7 The influence of dust and grit which may be deposited on the magnetic tape surface can therefore be satisfactorily and successfuly eliminated. Figure 5 shows a modification to the first embodiment wherein the direction of tilt of the sweeper member 7 is reversed, compared to that shown in Figure 3. Specifically, in this modification, the sweeper member 7 slants upwards toward the edge remote from the magnetic head 4 on the head base 5. This modification exhibits essentially the same sweeping effect on the magnetic tape surface as achieved in the first embodiment. As in the first embodiment of Figures 1 to 3, the magnetic heads 4 The sweeper members 7 Figures 6 and 7 show a third embodiment wherein an upper rotary drum 11 is formed with recesses 11 A sweeper member 13 is fixedly mounted on a head base 14 During recording and reproduction, the rotary drum 11, and thus the magnetic head 12 As shown in Figure 7, the magnetic heads 12 Figures 8, 9 and 10 show a modification to the foregoing third embodiment wherein a pair of sweeper members 13 During recording and reproduction, the sweeper members 13 Figure 11 shows an alternative embodiment of the rotary head assembly of Figures 8, 9 and 10. In this embodiment, the magnetic heads 12 Figure 12 shows a further alternative embodiment of the rotary head assembly of Figure 11. This alternative embodiment features a wider clearance between the lower surface of the rotary drum 11 and the upper surface of the stationary drum 2 than in the previous embodiment of Figure 11. The magnetic heads 12 Thus it can be seen that dust and grit which tends to be deposited on the magnetic tape surface can be successfully swept by the sweeper member or guide means in order to maintain reproduction level of the reocrding and or reproducing apparatus and successfully avoid damaging of the magnetic tape and or the magnetic head by the dust and grit.
