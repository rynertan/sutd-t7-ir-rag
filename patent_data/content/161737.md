# Electrochemical reductions of cyanopyridine bases.

## Abstract
Improved electrochemical reductions of cyanopyridine bases in which the reduction is performed by electrolysis in an ion exchange membrane divided flow cell at a lead dioxide cathode and in an aqueous or partly aqueous medium comprising sulfuric acid in at least a 1 1 mole ratio with the cyanopyridine base. In the case of 2 and 3 isomers, an iron salt is also added to the catholyte as a catalyst. In the case of the 4 isomer, an efficient, semi continuous batch process is reported. With all bases, significant advantages of a commercial and industrial nature are reported over prior art static, beaker cell technology.
