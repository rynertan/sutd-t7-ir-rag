# COLOR MEASURING AND CONTROL DEVICE

## Abstract
A color detecting device comprising a head 14 sup ported on an arm 30 for oscillatory motion over the product 11 being color measured to render a signal responsive to the average color of the product. A height detector 44 provides a signal indicating the distance between the product and head and is used to modify the color signal accordingly. A tempera ture sensor 39 in the head indicates an overtemperature condition for causing movement of the head away from the product. The screen 17 transparency is measured by the indicator 47, 48 to indicate when the screen is dirty.
