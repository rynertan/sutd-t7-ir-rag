# Current supply circuit.

## Abstract
A current supply circuit comprises a DC power feed circuit 25 exhibiting a constant current characteristic for a power source 1 and a constant resistance characteristic for a load, a first detecting circuit for detecting a load current or a load voltage, a DC DC converter circuit 22 inserted between the power source and the DC power feed circuit 25 , a second detecting circuit for detecting an output voltage from the DC DC converter circuit 22 and an operation circuit 24 coupled at the input with the output of the first detecting circuit and the output of the second detecting circuit for controlling the DC DC converter circuit 22 by the output thereof. The DC DC converter circuit 22 is so controlled as to produce a voltage representative of the sum of a voltage drop across the load and a fixed voltage necessary for the operation of the DC power feed circuit 25 .
