# TARGET RANGE STATUS INDICATOR AND CONTROLLER

## Abstract
Disclosed is an apparatus for indicating on a video display unit 22 the status of a plurality of targets 10 on a target range system and for controlling the operation thereof. In a preferred embodiment, the video display unit 22 comprises a variable image display unit which can be a cathode ray tube CRT which is responsive to a computer processing unit CPU 40 which sequentially and periodically interrogates each target mechanism 38 to determine its functional status and whether it has been hit . This information can be displayed in many different formats although in a preferred embodiment, a number of banks und lanes of targets are provided on the CRT which correspond to the bank and lanes of targets as laid out on the range. Further, the total hits for all targets in each lane are displayed on the screen along with a fault indication if necessary. Substantial improvements and the reli ability and maintainability of target range control sys tems are achieved by the use of the CRT equipped video display unit 22 in combination with the CPU 40 . In further preferred embodiments, all targets in an individual bank provide information to a field equipment module FEM 16 for that bank which then provides the information to a computer peripheral device 30 which converts the information to a form usable by the CPU. Additionally, the range may be controlled in a manual, automatic or semiautomatic mode and target status information along with lane scores provided in a permanent manner by means of a peripheral printer 42 .
