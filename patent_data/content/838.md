# Flexible bulk container.

## Abstract
A flexible bulk container for carrying up to one tonne or more of material in e.g. granular form. The container is of woven fabric, e.g. polypropylene, and includes a bag portion 1 to which are attached lifting loops 2 . Reinforcement is provided in the region of attachment of the loops 2 . To provide a simple and effective manner of obtaining reinforcement, in regions 11, 12 the strength of the fabric warp per unit width is increased, e.g. by using higher tenacity warp threads and or by cramming the warp threads closer together. Lifting stresses from loops 2 are transmitted down the higher warp strength regions 11, 12 . The regions 11, 12 could be adjacent a seam 7 between two fabric portions 3, 4 , extending along the selvedges. In an alternative arrangement, the container has a tubular main body portion, higher warp strength regions being disposed around the periphery.
