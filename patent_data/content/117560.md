# DOOR LOCK SYSTEM

## Abstract
A door lock assembly has a lock lever 19 for locking a door, and a control lever 31 connected with the lock lever for swinging the lock lever between a lock position and an unlock position. The control lever is connected with an lock knob or a key lock unit of the door. The control lever is swingable between a lock control position for holding the lock lever in the lock position and an unlock control position for holding the lock lever in the unlock position. The control lever can swing beyond the lock control position to a lock over position. The door lock assembly further has a posi tioning means 32 which enable the control lever to stop in the lock control position and the unlock control position. When the control lever is moved to the lock over position by the lock knob or the key lock unit, a position sensor 29 con nected with the control lever produces a lock signal, which is sent to an actuator. The actuator is connected with a se cond door lock assembly for locking a second door. In re sponse to the lock signal, the actuator puts the second door lock assembly into a lock position for locking the second door.
