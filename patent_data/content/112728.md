# Subscriber telephone system.

## Abstract
A system for providing telephone service to a subscriber has at least one unconventional telephone 40 and at least one master or interface unit 20 which is electrically connected between the telephone 40 and the central office. The opera tion of the telephone hook switch 44 in combination with the operation of the dialing information entering means 42 on the telephone provides changes in the impedance of the telephone 40 . The master unit 20 responds to these impedance changes to generate signals interpretable as dialing to the cen tral office. When the telephone 40 is on hook the master unit 20 responds to ringing from the C.O. and converts that signal to a signal which is used by the telephone 40 to alert the subscriber.
