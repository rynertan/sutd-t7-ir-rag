# Gauge changing apparatus.

## Abstract
The present invention provides an apparatus for trans ferring knitted fabric from needles of a first knitting gauge to needles of a second knitting gauge. A row of parallel, elongate points are provided each being arranged parallel to one another and secured at each end to a movable frame. The bands pass through respective slots in two trick bars with the points being located between the two bars so that movement of the bands in unison carries the points from one trick bar to the other. If the slots in the respective trick bars are at the two selected knitting gauge then passage of the bands through the slots adjusts the spacing of the points from one gauge to the other.
