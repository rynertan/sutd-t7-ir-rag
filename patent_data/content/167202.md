## Description
ALPHA CHLORINATION PROCESS EMPLOYING FOOD GRADE ANTIOXIDANTS, OXYGEN OR CYANOQUINONES James E. Thompson The present invention relates to improved processes for selectively chlorinating acyl compounds at the alpha or 2 posltlon. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The halogenation of organic compounds at a specific site or position regiospeciflc halogenatlon is a very difficult task. In general, hydrocarbon compounds tend to undergo halogenatlon to some degree at virtually every available carbon hydrogen linkage.The random nature of this substitution generally leads to an undesirable mixture of Isomers and homologs. Further, when additional reactants are employed to make the reaction more selective or specific, additional competing reactions are also likely to be encountered when more reactants are employed there Is a greater likelihood of side or competing reaction simply because there are more components in the system. The present invention makes use of the discovery that the most efficient way to prepare alpha substituted acyl compounds, particularly alpha chloro acyl chlorides and acyl esters, is to begin with the corresponding carboxylic acid chloride. The Hel l Voihard Zelinksy HVZ alpha bromination of car boxylic acids was discovered a century ago. This was based upon the observation that in the presence of a small amount of phosphorus, aliphatic carboxylic acids react smoothly with bromine to yield a compound in which the alpha hydrogen has been re placed by a bromine substituent. Only recently has work related to regiospecific halogenation of acyl compounds focused upon the alpha substitution of halogens other than bromine, and in parti cular to extending the HVZ reaction to alpha chloro substitution. it was then quickly appreciated that the propensity of chlorine to undergo competing free radical reactions under HVZ conditions required the development of specialized procedure that would favor the ionic alpha substitution process. See Little, Saxton, et al., Journal of the American Chemical Society 91 7098 1969 U.S. Patent 3,S84,036 to Saxton, et.al., both of which relate to the solution to this problem. Ogata, et. awl.1 have developed a procedure which employs the addition of gaseous chlorine to a neat aliphatic acid at 140or in the presence of a strong acid catalyst and oxygen. Ogata suggests that the preferred catalyst Is chlorosulfonic acid 10 mol 9 of the carboxylic acid In combination with the oxygen gas.See Ogata, et al., J Org. Chem., 40 2960 1975 Ogata, et al.,Tetrahedron 26 5929 1970 Ogata, et al., Nippon Kagaku Kaishi 1517 1975 1Chem. Abstr. 83 178239 1975all Ogata, et al.,Japanese Patent 75 135024 Ogata, et al., Japanese Patent 7424913. This method works particularly well for short chain lC2 Cf carboxylic acids. However, for chain lengths greater than C6, the reaction is adequate, but sub optimal. There is no suggestion here of halogenating acyl halide starting materials. Crawford, U.S.Patent 4,148,811, Issued April 10, 1979 U.S.Patent 4, 368,149, issued January 11, 1983 .1. Org. Chem. 48 1364 1983 describes the regiospecific halogenation of long chain, as well as short chain1 carboxylic acids, carboxylic acid halides, and acid anhydrides, employing a modification of Ogata s reaction. The major change is the use of a free radical inhibitor, such as 7,7,8.8 tetracyanoquinod imethane TCNQ , in place of the oxygen gas.This change TCNQ at 0.5molE in place of the oxygen resulted in an improved reaction that was unaffected by chain length. As stated above the use of oxygen and chioranil as taught by Ogata does not perform well on chain length greater than about C6. While Crawford states that this system can be used with the carboxylic acid, acid halide and acid anhydride, he states that temperatures above 1300C must be employed if elemental chlorine is used as the halogen source. He also describes the many quinone or quinone like structures which can be used as free radical inhibitors. U.S. Patent 3,880,923, Scheider, et al., issued April 29, 1975, describes an improved process for the production of alphachloro carboxylic acid chlorides by reacting a carboxylic acid chloride with chlorine at an elevated temperature in the presence of sulfuric acid. U.S. Patent 4,169,847, Degischer, issued October 2, 1979, describes an improved process for the production of alpha chloroalkanoyl chlorides by reacting alkanoyl chlorides with chlorine at an elevated temperature in the presence of chlorosulphonic acid as a catalyst. U.S. Patent 3,152,055, Katzschmann, issued October 6, 1964, describes production of aromatic chiorocarboxylic acid chlorides by using an ester as a starting material. The methods of the present Invention are simpler and more efficient, and possesses the following advantages versus those described in the art disclosed processes The reaction takes place under less rigorous conditions particularly when using elemental chlorine, goes more quickly, yields less alpha,alphadichloro material and other products of competing reactions , and works efficiently regardless of the chain length of the starting material. In particular, the present invention provides a marked improvement over the processes disclosed in U.S. Patents 3,584,036 4,148,811 and 4,368,140 discussed above. With respect to the processes described by Crawford, the present method allows the use of elemental chlorine at temperatures significantly below 1300C. This is accomplished by employing the carboxylic acid halide, particularly the carboxylic acid chloride, as the starting material. Certain of the present methods allow excellent results to be obtained by employing commercial antioxidants in place of the more expensive free radical inhibitors of Crawford if the carboxylic acid chloride is used as a starting material elemental chlorine and lower temperatures may also be employed. With respect to the processes described by Ogata, the present method is made more efficient by beginning with the carboxylic acid halide, particularly the carboxylic acid chloride.This means that significantly less rigorous conditions may be employed. For example, if chloranil is employed as a free radical inhibitor in a process which begins with the free acid, and in a process which begin with the acid chloride, a hlgher yield can be obtained with a lower reaction temperature by employing the acid chloride I.e., by following the teachings of the present in invention . The same is true if air or elemental oxygen are employed.If the acid chloride Is used as the starting material and air or elemental oxygen are employed alone without the free radical Inhibitors employed by Ogata and Crawford, chioranil or TCNQ , the methods above can be run with equivalent results. SUMMARY OF INVENTION The process of the present Invention comprises a method of producing alpha chloro acyl chlorides comprising contacting an acyl chloride with a chlorine source at r temperature of about 750C to about 1250C in the presence of I an effective amount of an auxiliary acidic agent and il an effective amount of a free radical Inhibitor selected from the group consisting of food grade antioxidants, oxygen, a cyanoquinone material and mixtures thereof. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention encompasses an improved process for chlorinating acyl halides. The acyl chlorides used herein are characterized in that they contain at least one reactive hydrogen substituent at the alpha or 2 position. It is this hydrogen substituent which is displaced during the process of the present invention. In the practice of this invention employing cyanoqulnones, the acyl chloride Is contacted with a chlorine source in the presence of an effective amount of an acidic auxiliary agent and an effective amount of a cyanoquinone material. This process is carried out at a temperature of 750C to 125 C. In the practice of this Invention employing antloxidants, the acyl chloride is contacted with a chlorine source in the presence of an effective amount of an acidic auxiliary agent and an effective amount of a food grade antioxidant material. This process Is carried out at a temperature of 750C to 1250C. In the practice of this invention employing air or oxygen alone, the acyl chloride is contacted with a chlorine source in the presence of an effective amount of an acidic auxiliary agent and air or elemental oxygen. This process is carried out at a temper ature of. 75 C to 1250C, The methods of the present invention may be employed to replace the alpha or 2 hydrogen substituent of any acyl halide with any halogen. However, as is well known, bromination, iodination, and particularly fluorination, reactions must be carried out under special conditions. Such reactions are therefore not contemplated in the practice of the present invention.Thus, while the present invention is particularly useful for both chlorinating and brominating acyl halides, on an industrial scale the processes of the present invention are particularly useful for chlorination reactions. Thus, by the term Hchlorination or chlorinating herein is meant replacing the alpha or 2 hydrogen substiuent of any acyl chloride with a chlorine however, the processes herein are useful for conducting bromination reactions. By the term acyl chloride11 herein is meant compounds of the formulaEMI5.1 wherein R and R are H or the same or different hydrocarbyl substituents having from 1 to 28 carbon atoms. The processes of the present invention are particularly useful in chlorinating the acid acyl chlorides of octanoic, nonanoic, decanoic capri , dodecanoic lauric , tetradecanolc myristic , hexadecanoic palmitic , end octadecanoic stearic acids. By the term effective amount of some material, component or agent, as that term is used herein, is meant a sufficient amount of that material, component or agent is present to direct the chlorination reaction reglospecifically such that it occurs almost exclusively at the alpha or 2 position of the acyl chloride. By comprising1 herein is meant that various other compatible materials may be present in the reaction mixtures during the chlorination process. These materials and their levels may be selected such that they do not adversely affect the regiospecificity of the chlorination reaction. For example, various solvents or solvent mixtures may be optionally employed. All percentages used herein are on a mol basis, unless otherwise specified. Mixture of any component may be used. ACIDIC AUXILIARY AGENTS The acidic auxiliary agents used in the practice of the present invention include many of the common acidic materials known in the art for use In chlorination reactions. Such materials include both Lewis acids and inorganic protic acids which are stronger acids than hydrocarbyl carboxylic acids. Such acidic auxiliary agents include, without limitation, PBr3, PCi3, thionyl chloride, sulfuryl chloride, oxalyl chloride, sulfonyl chloride, PC15, phosgene, fluorosulfonic acid, chlorosulfonic acid, and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid. Chlorosulfonic acid is preferred. It will be appreciated that the acyl halides themselves are not operative in the practice of this invention as acidic auxiliary agents inasmuch as it would then require the separation of the aiphachiorinated acidic auxiliary agent from the material undergoing the desired al pha halogenation. CYANOQUINONES The cyanoquinone materials used herein are all members of a well known class of compounds. They have been associated with the synthesis of alpha halogenated fatty acids. and. have also been the subject of intensive study as electricalfy conductive organic solids. Reviews of the preparation and properties of these materials and related materials can be found in the articles by Wheland, et al., J. Amer. Chem Soc. 98 3916 1976 andWheland, et al., J. Org. Chem. 40 3101 1975 both incorporated herein by reference. The use of these materials as free radical inhibitors is described in detail in U.S.Patent 4,148,811, issuedApril 10, 1979 U.S. Patent 9, 368,149, issued January 11, 1983 J. Org. Chem. 48 1364 1983 all incorporated herein by reference. A particularly useful synthesis is described by Crawford in A Practical Synthesis of 7,7,8, 8 Tetracyanoquinodimethane11, J.Org. Chem. 48, 1366 1983 incorporated herein by reference.In general, the cyanoquinones useful herein are characterized by the moietyEMI7.1 where R can be H or one or more substituent groups, e.g., halogen, alkyl, alkoxy, thioalkyl, CN, etc., as described byWheland, et al., above. The preferred cyanoquinones are the tetracyanoquinodimethane TCNQ compounds of the formulaEMI7.2 where R is as above. Highly preferred cyanoquinone materials useful in the processes of . the present invention include 7,7,8, 8 tetracyanoquinodimethane TCNQ , hexacyanobutadiene HCBCt and tetracyanonaphthoquinodlmethane ITNAP . These can be depicted as follows EMI8.1 Tetracyanoquinodimethane TCNQ , hexacyanobutadiene HCBC and tetracyanonaphthoquinodimethane TNAP t can all be prepared according to conventional, art disclosed techniques, including those discussed by Wheland, et al., as described above. It should be noted that HCBD is not, in a technical sense, a formal quinone structure. However, its extended conjugated system of electrons gives it quinone like characteristics. It has therefore come to be considered a cyanoquinone in the art it is so considered within the present invention. The most preferred catalyst system herein comprises a mixture of TCNQ and chlorosulfonic acid. Various ratios of these materials can be employed, but a ca. 1 5 1 50 mole ratio of TCNQ CI503H is convenient. The most preferred chlorination reagent herein comprises gaseous or liquid elemental chlorine and the aforesaid mixture ofTCNQ and chlorosulfonic acid. Of course, the chlorine in this reagent is replenished as it is exhausted during the reaction.Replenishment of the chlorine is most conveniently carried out by bubbling gaseous chlorine into the reaction mixture. In a highly preferred embodiment of the present invention, the above catalyst system is used in combination with air or elemental oxygen. Air or elemental oxygen ls bubbled through the reaction mixture preferably at a rate which achieves saturation in the reaction mixture. The chlorination reaction of this invention is carried out by contacting the acyl chloride compound with the chlorine or chlorine source in the presence of a cyanoquinone material and acidic auxiliary agent at a temperature of 750C to 125 C. In particular, chlorination reactions using elemental chlorine as the chlorine are carried out at temperatures of 750C to 1250C, preferably at temperatures with the range from 1000C to 710 C. Bromination and lodination reactions are carried out under similar temperature conditions. The process herein can be carried out in the presence or absence of inert solvents. Preferably, the reaction is carried out without the use of solvents, as this is both convenient and economical on a commercial scale. Indeed, the use of solvents can lead to undesirable side reactions involving chlorination of many of the common hydrocarbon solvents. Under the reaction temperatures specified hereinabove, the acyl chloride compounds are liquids and are quite convenient to use in that state without additional solvents. Typical use concentrations of the cyanoquinones relative to the acyl chloride compounds are 0.01 10.0 mole percent, preferably 0.05 5.0 mole percent, most preferably 0.05 0.5 mole percent. Typical use concentrations of the acidic auxiliary agents relative to the acyl chloride compounds are 0.1 10 mole percent, preferably 1.0 5 mole percent. ANTIOX I DANTS it has also been discovered that certain antioxidants can be employed in the reaction of the present invention. Since many antioxidants work by inhibiting or interrupting the propagation step in the oxidation process, it was postulated and confirmed that these same agents would work in the same hshion, i.e. as free radical Inhibitors, in the processes of the present invention. Useful antioxidants Include commercially available food grade antioxidants, especially the hindered phenols and secondary alkylaryl and diarylamines. For example, compounds of the general formula X EMI10.1 where R and R are the same or different alkyl groups, and preferably butyl, are preferred. Also preferred are the bisphenols, such as those of the general formulae Xl and Xli EMI10.2 wherein X is CH2, CHR1, CR1R2, or S, wherein R1 and R2 are as described for R and R above. Preferred antioxidants include butylated hydroxyanisole BHA , butylated hydroxytoluene BHT , t butyl hydroquinone TBHQ propyl galiate PG , and 6 ethoxy 1 92 dihydro 2,2 4 trimethylquinoline. Particularly preferred antioxidants include . butylated hydroxyanisole BHA , butylated hydroxytoluene BHT , and propyl gal late PG . Mixtures of all the above may also be employed. The preferred catalyst systems herein comprise mixtures ofTBHQ, BHA, or BHT, and chlorosulfonic acid. Various ratios of these materials can be employed, but a 1 5 1 50 mole ratio of antioxidant CISO3H is convenient. The most preferred chlorination reagent herein comprises gaseous or liquified elemental chlorine and the aforesaid mixtures of antioxidant and chlorosulfonic acid. Of course, the chlorine in this reagent is replenished as it is exhausted during the reaction.Replenishment of the chlorine is most conveniently carried out by bubbling gaseous chlorine Into the reaction mixture. The chlorination reaction of this invention Is carried out by contacting the acyl chloride compound with the chlorine or chlorine source In the presence of material and acidic auxiliary agent at a temperature of 75 C to 125 C. In a highly preferred embodiment of the present invention, the above catalyst system is used in combination with air or elemental oxygen. Air or elemental oxygen is bubbled through the reaction mixture preferably at a rate which achieves saturation in the reaction mixture. In particular, chlorination reactions using elemental chlorine as the chlorine are carried out at temperatures of 750C to 125 C, and preferably at temperatures with the range from 100oC to 1100C. Bromination and lodination reactions are carried out under similar temperature conditions. The process herein can be carried out in the presence or absence of inert solvents. Preferably, the reaction Is carried out without the use of solvents, and this is both convenient and economical on a commercial scale. Indeed, the use of solvents can lead to undesirable side reactions involving chlorination of many of the common hydrocarbon solvents. Under the reaction temperatures specified hereinabove, the acyl chloride compounds are liquids and are quite convenient to use in that state without additional solvents. Typical use concentrations of the antioxidants relative to the acryl chloride compounds are 0.1 10.0 mole percent, preferably 0.1 5.0 mole percent, most preferably 0.5 0.5 mole percent. Typical use concentrations of the acidic auxiliary agents relative to the acyl chloride compounds are 0.1 10 mole percent, preferably 1.0 2.5 mole percent. The following examples illustrate the practice of the present invention but are not intended to be in any way limiting thereof. AIRIOXYGEN ALONE As has been described above in detail, it has been discovered that many known alpha chlorination reactions can be improved better yields under less rigorous conditions by using acyl chloride starting materials. It has also been discovered that the increased efficiency which results from the methods employing acyl chloride starting materials allows this reaction to be conducted just as efficiently as known methods Ogata, Crawford, discussed above without the use of antioxidants or cyanoquinones. Acssrdingly, the process of the present invention comprises a method of producing alpha chloro acyl chlorides in the absence less thain 0.005 mol of antioxidants or cyanoquinones comprising contacting an acyl chloride with a chlorine source at a temperature of 750C to 1250C in the presence of i an effective amount of an auxiliary acidic agent and ii an effective amount c f elemental oxygen or air. See Trial 19 of Example IV. The preferred catalyst systems herein comprises a mixture of air and chlorosulfonic acid.Various ratios of these materials can be employed, but a system which passes air through the reaction mixture such that saturation is achieved is preferred and convenient. The most preferred chlorination reagent herein comprises gaseous or liquid elemental chlorine and the aforesaid mixtures of air or oxygen and chlorosulfonic acid. Of course, the chlorine in this reagent is replenished as it is exhausted during the reaction. Replenis clment of the chlorine is most conveniently carried out by bubblinc gaseous chlorine into the reaction mixture. The chlorination reaction of this invention is carried out by contacting the acyl chloride compound with the chlorine or chlorine source in the presence of material and acidic auxiliary agent at a temrperature of 750C to 1250C. In particular, chlorination reactions using elemental chlorine as the chlorine are carried out at temperatures of 750C to 1250C, and preferably at temperatures with the range from 1000C to 11 00C. Bromination and lodination reactions are carried out under similar temperature conditions. The process herein can be carried out in the presence or absence of inert solvents. Preferably, the reaction is carried out without the use of solvents, and this is both convenient and economical on a commercial scale. indeed, the use of solvents can lead to undesirable side reactions involving chlorination of many of the common hydrocarbon solvents. Under the reaction temperatures specified hereinabove, the acyl chloride compounds are liquids and are quite convenient to use in that state without additional solvents. The following examples illustrate the practice of the present invention but are not intended to be in any way limiting thereof. EXAMPLE I Alpha Chlorination of Nonanoyl Chloride in the Presence of Tetracyanoquinodimethane TCNQ A 1.0 liter five necked round bottomed flask was fitted with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer, dry ice condenser with a gas exit tube and two fritted glass dispersion tubes which extended to near the bottom of the flask. The two dispersion tubes were connected via PVC tubing to a Y connector and thence to a chlorine source. An in line flow meter was employed. The flask was charged with 487 g 2.75 moles of nonanoyl chloride and was immersed in an oil bath maintained at 1000C. TCNQ 1.8 g, 8.8 millimoles, 0.32 mole t and chlorosulfonic acid 9.6 g, 82.5 millimoles, 3 mole t were added and the chlorine flow was started time, t O . The flow rate was 2.5 liters min 900 ml min mole . A mild exotherm occurred which gradually raised the temperature to 1200C. It held there until near the end of the reaction. At t 25 min, an additional 1.0 g 14.9 millimoles, 0.18 mole 9ffi of TCNQ was added. At t 40 min T 1200C , chlorine began to reflux more rapidly and the temperature began to fall.By t 49 min, the temperature had dropped to 900C and the chlorine flow was stopped. The oil bath was removed. Aliquots subsequently showed that the reaction was complete by t 45 min. The reaction mixture was degassed and the alpha chloro acid chloride was distilled directly from the reaction flask. A main fraction, 999 g 858 , b.p. 69 700C 0.5 mm was obtained. This fraction was 99 pure by gas chromatography. Other, less pure distillation fractions contained an additional 5 68 of the desired product.

The inlet tubes each had 3 mm diameter openings and extended to near the bottom of the reaction flask. One was connected via PVC tubing to a chlorine source containing an in line flow meter. The other was similarly connected to a compressed air source. The flask was charged with 52.2 g 320 millimoles of octanoyl chloride and was immersed in an oil bath maintained at 1000C.

At t 25 min, chlorine reflux began to accelerate and the reaction was stopped at t 30.5 min. For convenient yield determination, the acid chloride was converted to methyl ester by the addition of 150 ml of methanol.This mixture was dissolved in 300 ml of methylene chloride and was washed successively with 100 ml portions of water twice saturated sodium bicarbonate solution once and water again twice . The organic solution was dried overnight, filtered and distilled to give 57.0 g 93 of distillate, b.p. 720 0.3 mm .By gas chromatography, the product consisted of 97.78 monochloro and 2.38 dichloro octanoate.
