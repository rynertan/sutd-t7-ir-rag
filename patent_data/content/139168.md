## Description
A METAL ALLOY COMPOSITION This invention relates to a metal alloy composition. The advantages of shaping metal while in a partially solid, partially liquid condition have now become well known. U.S. patents 3,948,650 and 3,954,455 disclose a process for making possible such shaping processes b the prior vigorous agitation of a metal or metal alloy while it is in a semi solid condition. This converts the norrally dendritic microstructure of the alloy into a non dendritic form comprising discrete deganerate dendrites in a lower melting mavri . The resulting alloy is capable of being shaped in a semi solid condition by casting, forging or other known forming processes. Considerable cost advantage results from practice of the foregoing semi solid technology. However, it is sub ject to certain limitations. The first prt of the proces normally involv s the production of cast bars having the required non dendritic structure. The technical feasibility of casting diameters of less than about 25.4 mm on a practical scale is very low and, because of the nature of the process even were it feasible, would result in extremely low output.Moreover, the casting process in may instances produces cast bars which exhibit less than desirable skin microstructure which must be trimmed mechanically or otherwise treated for subsequent processing In addition, the generation of diameters of varying sine is cumbersome and expensive since each diamet r necessitates a complete casting cycle including set up, mold preparation and rtmn ing. Flexibility is, therefore, low. It is accordingly a primary object of the present invention to provide a metal composition having a uniform, fine trained microstructure which is unobtainable from any prior metal forming processes. It is an additional object of the invention to provide a metal alloy composition which may be formed ir a partially solid, partially liquid condition. It is an additional object of the invention to provide suc a conposition which does not require the vigorous agitation of the metal composition during its preparation. The foregoing and other objects of the invention are achieved in a metal alloy position having a uniform, fine grained microstructure comprising uniform discrete spheroidal particles contained within a lower melting matrix, said alloy being a magnesium, ferrous or copper alloy prepared by producing a solid metal alloy composition having an essentially directional grain structure heating said directional grain composition to a temperature above the solidus and below the liguidus to produce a partially solid, partially liquid mixture, containing at least 0.05 volume fraction liquid, said composition prior to heating having a strain level introduced such that upon heating, the mixture comprises uniform discrete spheroidal particles contained with a matrix canposition having a lager melting point than said particles and solidifying said heated alloy compositions.The solidified composition has a uniform, fine grained microstructure comprisiny uniform discrete spheroidal particles contained within a lower melting m.atrs . The metal compositions produced by the forescing process have a more uniform and finer grain structure than are obtainable by any other known process. The invention will 5 better understood by reference to the accompanying drawing in which FIGURE 1 is a time temperature profile of a typical process in accordance with the practice of the invention FIGURES 2 through 14 are photomicrographs showing the microstructure of alloys at various stages in the process of the invention. All micrographs are at a magnification of 100. Tt is normally considered extremely harmful to heat an alloy even a small amount above its solidus temperature during heat treating or shaping processes other than casting hecause of grain boundary melting and embrittlement of the metal. Such melting, often referred to as hot shortness or burning, adversely affects workability and decreases the strength and ductility of the alloy.There are isolated disclosures in the literature of excep tions to the avoidanco of melting but they are largely variations of solutionizing processes in which heterc geneities are removed by dissolving then in a matrix phase ror example, U.S. patent 2,243,349 heats an aluminum alloy to incipient fusion to improve its hot workability. U.S.patents 3,988,180, 4,106,956, 4,019,927 heat an alloy to just above tlie solidus temperature and hold the alloy at that temperature until the dendritic phase becomes globular.In all 0 this prior art, however, the heterogeneities caused by melting are deleterious and must b reved prior to subsequent working. The present invention involves a technique for inducing heterogeneities into the. structure in such a fashion that the structures can 5 transformed into a homogeneous mixture of very uniform discrete particles.The product of the present process is a metal composition having a uniform, fine grained microstructure consisting of spheroidal particles engulfed in a solidified liquid phase. The microstructure is more uniform and the particles are generally rounder and of smaller size than comparable alloys of the prior art. In the case of aluminum and virtually every cther alloy tested, these particles are less than 30 Ãš in diameter. The process of the invention has a number of very significant advantages. Casting of the starting billet nay be carried out in a single convenient diameter, e.g. 152.4 mn, at one location and reduced to any desirable smaller diameter at the same or a second location using conventional extrusion equipment and technology. The process permits removal of any dendritic exterior skin on the staring hillet as part of normal practice prior to extrusion so that the extruded billet exhibits no skin effect. Moreover, tha process produces a consiuerable refinement of the micro structure of the final product, including its size, shape and distribution relative to the starting billet micro structure In the practice of the present process, a directional grain structure is produced by hot workinn a metal composi tion, as by extrusion, rcllino, forging, swaging or other means, at a temperature below the solidus temperature.By hot working is nant any process which de forms a netal or alloy between the recrystallization temperature typically, . 7Tsolidus Kelvin and the solidus temperature solidus such that it produces a striated or directional grain structure. According to a preferred embodinent of the invention, the directional grain structure is produced by extrusion. The extrusion ratio should normall be greater than 10 1 to produce the desired directional grain structure and may range as high as economically practical.We have found useful extrusion ratios frequently range from about 19 1 to about 60 1. A critical lever of strain must be introduced into the metal or alloy either concurrently with and as an integral part of the hot working step, or as a separate step subseguent to hot working and prior to heating to above the solidus temperature. Strain is introduced integral with the hot working operation, for example, by an in line straightening operation, by rapid chilling of the hot worked naterial to introduce thermal strains or by extruding at lower temperatures such as to leave residual strains in the extruded product. tower extrusion or other hot working tamperatures tend to leave higher residual strains in the extrusion since the extrusion pressures go up as the temperatures go down, i.e. more energy is used up by the extrusion process.As a separate step, strain is introduced by cold working. Cold working operations foiir. to be effective include drawing, swaging, rolling and compression or upseting Strain level is meant to represcnt an residual strain remaining within a grain after the deformation process is completed. The actual strain level will any with the specific metal or alloy and with the type and conditions of hot working. In the case of extruded aluminum alloy, the strain level should be equivalent to at least a 12 cold worked alloy.In ganeral, the level of strain can be determined empiflcally by determining whether, after heating to above the solidus temperature, the partially solid, partially liquid mixture comprises uniform discrete spheroidal solid particles contained within a lower melting matrix composition. alloys, in which the directional grain structure is produced by hot working and particularly by extrusion, and which are separately cold worked, have been found to possess. a particularly improved uniform, fine grained microstructure unavailable by other processes. Upon completion of hot working and any required cold working, the alloy is then reheated to a temperature above the solidus and below the liquidus. The specific tempera ture is generally such as to produce a 0.05 to 0.3 volume fraction liquid, preferably at least 0.10 volume fraction liquid and in most cases a 0.15 to 0.5 volume fraction liquid The reheated alloy may then be solidified and again reheated for shaping in a partially solid, partially liquid condition or t.le shaping step may be integral with the original reheat of the alloy to a partially solid, partially liquid sat. The second reheat of tiie alloy may be to a higher fraction solid than the first re ieat, but it is preferable not more than G.20 fraction solid greater. In the preferred practice of the invention, the alloy is heated to a Sami solid stat and shaped at t san time in a press forging operation. In such a process, the alloy charge is heated to the requisite partially soli, partially liquid temperature, placed in a die cavity and shaped under pressure. Both shaping and solidification times are extremely short and pressures are comparatively low. This press forging process is more completely disclosed in German applicationDE OS 29 29 812 and DE OS 29 29 845, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. Other semisolid forming processes which may be used are die casting, semi solid extrusion and related shaping techniques. Figure 1 is a typical time temperature profile of a process in accordance with the invention. The vertical axis is temperature the horizontal axis is time. The graph is intended to graphically portray a relative time tenperature relationship rather than sat forth precise values. As can be seen from the graph, a metal is melted and solidified to form a cast billet, either dandritic or non dendritic. The cast billet is preheated, e.g. approximately 30 minutes for a typical aluminum casting alloy, to above the recrystallization temperature, extruded and quenched to produce a solid metal composition having a directional chain structure.The extruded metal composition is then cold worked at room temeprature to introduce a proper level of strain It is then reheated above the solidus temperature, e.g. about 100 seconds for atypical aluminum alloy, to a semi solid condition an rapidly quenched. The starting material for practice of the present process may be a dendritic matal or allot of the type conventionall cast into billets or a non dendritic metal or alloy of the type in which a billet has been vigorously agitated during freezing in accordance with the toachings of the aforementionedU.S. patent 3,948,650. Such agitation produces a so called slurry cast structure, that is one having discrete, degenerate dendritic particles within a lower melting matrix. Copending application S.M. 363,621 filed March 30, 1982, is directed to a process in which the starting material is a billet having a slurry cast structure in which the slurry cast structure is rehabilitated by heating to a seni solid state.The disclosure of said coding application is hereby incorporated by reference. Billets which have hen prodused under conditions of vigorous agitation may be produced by the continuous direct chill casting process set forth in published British patent application 2,042,306A, the disclosure of which is also hereby incorproated by reference. In that application, molten metal is cooled while it is vigorously agitated in a rotating magnetic field. The process is continuous and produces continuous lengths of billets having a discrete degenerate dendritic structure. Billets are referred to below as billets which ha se been chill cast under a shearing environment during solidification to distin guish those which have be vigorously agitated from those which have not. The microstructure of non dendritic compositions pro duced in accordance with the aforementioned U.S. patent 3,948,650 and which is also produced in accordance with the process of the present invention may be variously described as comprising discrete spheroidal particles contained within a matrix co.m..position having a lower melting point or, alternatively, as discrete primary phase particles enveloped by a solute rich matrix. Such a structure will hereinafter be described in accordance with the first mentioned description, but it should be understood that the various descriptions are essentially alternative ways of describing the same microstructure. The following examples are illustrative o the practice of the invention. Unless otherwise indicated, all parts and percentages are by weight except for fraction solids which are by volume. xample 1 An aluminum casting alloy Aluminum Association Alloy 357 was direct chill cast without shearing to 2 152.4 mm dia meter. Figure 2 is a micrograph of a crossection of the direct chill cast bar in which its dendritic structure is apparent. The alloy had the following percent composition Si 7.0 Zn .02 Cu .010 Ti .10 .004 Al Remainder .50 A section of the cast bar was preheated to 3800C ingress than 1 2 hour and extruded at a 50 1 ratio into a 22.2 mm diameter rod. Extrusion pressure was 67,000 psi. The rod exited at 7.62 m minute and at 4600C and was fan quenched.The extruded bar was stretched straight approximately 1 perman ent set to introduce strain into the bar as an integral step of the extrusion process. Figure 3 is 2 photomicrograph of a longitudinal section of the extruded stretched bar. Its directional grain structure is very evident. The extruded samples were then inductively reheated in a 3,000 6.z field at 50.8 mm 152.4 mm 6.75 kW in a ID coil by long for 100 5 seconds to a . 7 . 9 fraction solid and immediately water quenched to 26 C These guenched samples were metallographically examined for particle size and shape. Figure 4 is a micrograph cf a cross section of the reheated and quenched sample.Fig. 4 demon strates the dramatic refinement of the microstructure obtained over that of the starting billet Fig. 2 . It further demon strafes that the severely worked microstructure of the extruded section can be converted to a slurry microstructure by beating to a 0.1 or higher fraction liquid. Example 2 An aluminum casting alloy Aluminum Association Alloy 357 was cast as in Example 1, preheated to 380 C within 1 2 hour and extruded into 31.75 mmdiameter rod. The ex trusion pressure was 9840 bar. The rod exited at 4.27 m ute and 5000C and was fan quenched. The extruded bar was stretched straight approximately 1 permanent set. Portions of the rod were then drawn 36 to 25.4 mm diameter. Samples were taken of the as extruded and drawn material and inductively reheated and press forged as in Example 1 but this time into a 1.27 mm wall cup.Figure 5 is a representative micrograph of a section through the final product again showing a uni form, fine grained slurry type microstructure. Example 3 An aluminum wrought alloy Aluminum Association Alloy 2024 was direct chill cast, homogenized to reduce extrusion pressure and tendency to hot tear during hot working and extruded toa 25.4 mm diameter. The alloy had the following com position Cu 4.4 .6 Mg 1.5 Al Remainder Samples of the as extruded bars were reheated as in Example 1 while other samples of the extruded bars were compressed 29 and reheated. Figure 6 is a representative micrograph of the final r heated but not cold worked samples. Figure 7 is a representative micrograph of the cold worked samples.It is apparent that the cold worked samples bad a con siderably more refined microstructure than the sample which had been reheated out cold work.Example 4 Example 3 was repeated with an aluminum wrought alloy Aluminum Association Alloy 6061 having the following composition Si .6 Cu .28 Mg 1.0 Cr .2 Al RemainderAgain micrographs were made of samples which were extruded and reheated and samples which were extruded, compressed 29 and reheated. Microstructure differences were as set forth in Example 3 and as illustrated by rigs. 6 and 7.Example 5 Example 3 was again repeated with an aluminum wrought alloy Aluminum Association Alloy 6262 having the following composit son Si .6 Zn 2.0 Cu .28 P6 .6 Mg 1.0 Bi Cr .09 Al Coarative results were as set forth in Examples 3 and 4. Example 6 Example 5 was again repeated with an aluminum wrought alloy Aluminun Association Alloy 7075 having the following composition Cu 1.6 Zn 5.6 2.5 Al Remainder Cr .23Results were as set forth in Examples 3 5.Example 7 An aluminum alloy Aluminum Association Alloy 375 was direct chill cast under a shearing environment to a 152.4 mm diameter. The alloy had the following percent composition Si 7.0 Zn .02 Cu .010 Ti .10 .004 Al Remainder Mg .30A 559 mm length was preheated to 520 C in less than 1 2 hour and extruded into a 22.23 mmdiameter rod. Extrusion pressure was 7031 bar. The rod exited at 7.3 m minute and at 520 C and was fan quenched. 25.4 mm sections were then axially compressed at room temperature between two parallel plates so that the length was reduced 5, 10, and 16 . Samples then were taken of the as extruded and the compressed sections and inductively reheated in a 3,000 Hz field at 6.75 kW in a 50.8 mm ID coil by 152.4 mm long for 100 5 seconds to a .7 .9 fraction solid and immedia tely water quenched to 240C. These quenched samples were metallographically examined for particle size and shape. A 35 gram 25.4 mm section of the extruded billet was then axially compressed 255 and press forged into a threaded plug in accordance with the process of the aforementioned copending application S.N. 290,217 in a partially solid, partially liquid condition. Reheat time was 50 seconds, fraction solid was 0.85, dwell time was 0.5 seconds and pressure was 1054 bar with respect to atmosphere. Photomiorographs at various stages of the process 152.4 mm were taken. The starting diameter billet exhibited particles of approximately 100 microns diameter. The extruded billet showed a directional grarn microstructure in which the grains were very elongated. Micrographs of the center section of reheated billets, which were as extruded and compressed 5, 10 and 165 respectively, showed that particle size and shape continued to improve as the strain was increased, particularly as strain was increased over 10 . Te microstructure of a sample which was compressed 25 and press. forged into a threaded plug showed much wine scale microstructure and more uniform shape and distribution of the grains in the final product as compared with the starting billet. It also showed the remarkable inluence of the residual strain upon the reheated grain structure of the extruded product.le 8 The aluminum casting alloy of Example 7 was direct chill cast as .n that example to 2 12d4iter billet. A 559 section was preheated within n 1 2 hour to 3300C much lower than Example 1 and extruded into a28.58 mm diameter rod.Extrusion pressures for this rod were 31639 bar much greater than Example 1 . The rod exited at 7.01 m per mirute 490 C and was fan quenched. Samples were inductivaly reheated to a .7 .9 fraction solid as in Example 7 and water quenched.These quenches were metallographically examined for particle size and shape and found to be similar to the reheated, compressed 25 and press forged sample of Example 7. 9n this extrusion, the combination of low preheat T 330 C and fan cooling produced suitable residual strain in the extrusion. Example 9 A copper wrought alloy C544 of 4 5n, 4 Pb, balance copper, was extruded to produce a directional grain structure and cold reduced 35 to a 25.4 mm diameter. Samples of the asextruded bars were reheated us the procedure of Example 1 but for longer times, typically 200 seconds, in order to produce the partially solid, partially liquid structure and press forged into cams for use in water pumps. Fig. 8. is a micrograph of a crosssection of the press forged final product.Example 10 Copper wrought alloy C360 containing 3.0 lead, 35.5 zinc, balance copper, was extruded and then cold reduced approximately 18 to a 25.4 mm diameter. Samples of the cold worked extrusion were reheated as in Example 1. Micrographs of crossections of the final reheated alloy showed a microstructure very similar to that of Fig. a. Examples 11 13 Thres additional copper alloys were hot worked to a small diameter substantially as described in the previous examples. Example 11 was hot worked by extrusion and cold worked an additional 50 . Example 12 was also hot worked by extrusion and cold worked an additional 298. Example 13 was also hot worked by extrusion and cold work tR an additional 20 , and then cold worked approximately 20 25.Example 11 was alloy C110 which is 99.9 copper, balance oxygen and titus represents an almost pure metal Example 12 was alloy C187 which is 938 copper and 1 lead. Exarple 13 was alloy C360 which is 60 copper, 3 lead, balance zinc.Micrographs of crossections of the final reheated and press forged or reheated and quenched alloys are shown in Fig. 9 Example 11 , Fig. 13 Example 12 and Fig. 11 Example 13 .The allcys of these three examples were reheated to a temperature of about 1070 C, 9800C and 890 C respectively.The microstructures shown in these micrographs show substantial grain refinement relative to comparable microstructures of alloys produced by vigorous agitation of the alloy while in a semi solid condition xample 14 Magnesium alloy A231B 4 Al, 1 Zn, 0.2 Mn, balance Mg was prepared and hot worked as set forth in precedingExamples 11 13 and the bars were then subjected to an additional 12 compressive cold work Fig. 12 shows the microstructure of a crossecticn of the final alloy reil ated to about 610 C and quenched.Again, the structure is superior in both particle size and shape to the most closely analogous alloys of te prior art comparable magnesium alloys prepared by vigorous agitation during freezing of the alloy while in semi solid condition.Example 15 Stainless steel alloy 316 17 iJi, 12 Cr, 2.58 no, balance Fe was hot worked by hot rolling and cold worked an additional 400. Fig. 13 is a micrograph of a crossection of the alloy reheated to about 13300C and quenched. Particle sizes are considerably finer and more uniform than comparable particles of vigorously agitated stainless steel alloys. Exarnle 16 A stainless steel alloy 440C .95 1.2 C, 16 18 Cr,Max 1 Mn, Max. 1 Si, Max. 75 Mo, balance Fe was cast, hot rolled and cold worked an additional 20 by cold compression. The microstructure of the alloy reheated to about 13900C and quenched is shown in Fig. 14. While the foregoing examples have demonstrated practice of the process with a variety of aluminum, copper, magnesium and ferrous alloys, the process is applicable to other metals and metal alloys as long as the metal is capable of forming a two phase system having solid particles in a lower melting matrix phase. Reprasentative additional alloys which may be used are chose of nickel, cobalt, lead, zinc and titaniuTn.The alloys nay be so called casting alloys such as aluminum alloys 356 and 357 or wrought alloys such as aluminum alloys 6061, 2024 and 7075 and cor alloys C544 and C360.
