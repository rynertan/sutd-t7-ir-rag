## Description
This invention relates to rubber metal composites and to certain novel compounds useful as rubber metal bonding promoters. Articles in which rubber is bonded to metal have been known for many years, and since the introduction of the steel belted radial tyre, rubber metal bonding has been very extensively studied. It is known that certain substances will act as adhesion promoters to improve the initial adhesion level between the rubber and the metal and the maintenance of the adhesion level during accelerated laboratory ageing tests designed to simulate conditions to which the article may be subjected during its service life. The main adhesion promoters currently used to promote the bonding of brass coated steel to rubber are cobalt compounds, for example cobalt naphthenate, and resorcinol and or melamine formaldehyde resins used in conjunction with hydrated silica. Both these types of adhesion promoters, which can be employed separately or in combination, have disadvantages, and alternative rubber metal adhesion promoters to those currently employed are therefore desirable. Our European Patent Application EP A 0 109 955 discloses rubber metal adhesion promoters of the general formula Chemical Abstracts, Vol. 80, No. 21, May 1974, Abstract No. 116081h discloses 2 hydroxyethyl thiosulphate, monosodium salt.

Chemical Abstracts Vol. 69, July 1968, Abstract No. 18773p mentions sodium 4 phthalimidobutylthiosulphate Chemical Abstracts Vol. 89, July 1978, Abstract No. 43235k discloses sodium or potassium salts of compounds of the formula RS₂O₃H where R represents 5 uracilmethyl or 6 methyl 5 uracilmethyl and Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, Vol. 12, 1969, 510 512 discloses compounds of the formula H₂N CH₂ The present application relates to the use, as rubber metal bonding promoters, of compounds within the above general formula The invention includes a composite comprising a sulphur vulcanisable rubber composition containing the rubber, sulphur, a vulcanisation accelerator, a component having a metal surface in contact with the composition, and, as a rubber metal bonding promoter, a compound as defined above. The invention further includes an article in which vulcanised rubber is bonded to a metal surface, the article having been obtained by heating a composite of the invention to vulcanisation temperature to vulcanise the rubber. Preferably, the article is a tyre, the metal being brass coated on steel cords. The rubber metal bonding promoters defined above where M represents an equivalent of a divalent nickel or cobalt ion are novel compounds, and those wherein R represents hydroxy, chlorophenyl, fluorophenyl, nitrophenyl, alkoxyphenyl, alkylphenyl, dialkylphenyl, arylphenyl, phthalimido, or 2,4 dihydroxy 6 pyrimidyl or its keto form equivalent , are claimed herein. Within the above general formula, various sub classes of compound are preferred, mainly because the starting materials required for their syntheses are more readily available than in some other instances. These sub classes can be represented by the formulae In more preferred instances, b has a value of from 2 to 8 c has a value of from 2 to 8 d has a value of from 1 to 8 e has a value of from 1 to 8 f has a value of from 1 to 8 g has a value of from 2 to 8 h has a value of from 1 to 11 and j has a value of from 2 to 8. Where, in the above formula, any of the symbols a to j has a value 2 or more, the alkylene group CH₂ As can be seen from the above formulae, the compounds are salts of thiosulphuric S esters, but they are named for convenience hereinbelow as organic thiosulphate salts. Specific examples of compounds useful in the invention, in addition to those described in the examples below, are the sodium, cobalt and nickel salts of The rubber metal bonding promoters that are sodium salts can be prepared by the nucleophilic substitution of halogen, usually chlorine or bromine, in an appropriate starting material having a replaceable halogen atom, by reaction with sodium thiosulphate. The reaction is usually performed in water or in an aqueous alcoholic medium under reflux, but it may be advantageous to use reaction temperatures above the reflux temperatures of aqueous ethanol or methanol mixtures at normal pressures, by carrying out the reaction in an autoclave. For solubility reasons, aqueous ethanol or aqueous methanol is generally a more suitable reaction medium than the alcohol alone. Reaction times vary with the reaction temperature and the ease of replacement of the halogen atom. Typical reaction times for the replacement of chlorine at temperatures within the range 100 150 C. are from 60 to 15 minutes. The solvent is then evaporated giving a residue which is essentially a mixture of the sodium salt of the organic thiosulphate and a sodium halide. Separation of these two components of the mixture can be effected by selective extraction with a solvent such as absolute ethanol in which the organic salt is significantly more soluble than the sodium halide. Further details and possible variations in reaction conditions for the reaction between sodium thiosulphate and organic halides are described in our EP A 0 070 143. The compounds of the invention that are nickel salts are most conveniently prepared using the sodium salts as intermediates. For example displacement of the sodium ion can be effected by the introduction of a solution of the sodium salt of the organic thiosulphate into a column of cation exchange resin in which the exchangeable ions are nickel. This procedure produces as a percolate a solution of the nickel salt of the organic thiosulphate from which the nickel salt in solid from, often containing water of crystallisation, can be obtained by evaporation of the percolate. An alternative procedure comprises mixing the sodium organic thiosulphate and a nickel salt in a solvent in which both are at least moderately soluble but in which the by product sodium salt has low solubility. Absolute methanol can be used as such a solvent in some instances. The bonding promoters of the invention are especially effective in compositions in which the rubber is cis polyisoprene, either natural or synthetic, and in blends containing at least 25 by weight of cis polyisoprene with other rubbers. Preferably the rubber, if a blend, contains at least 40 and more preferably at least 60 by weight of cis polyisoprene. Examples of other rubbers which may be blended with cis polyisoprene include poly 1,3 butadiene, copolymers of 1,3 butadiene with other monomers, for example styrene, acrylonitrile, isobutylene and methyl methacrylate, ethylene propylene diene terpolymers, and halogen containing rubbers such as chlorobutyl, bromobutyl and chloroprene rubbers. In the compositions of the invention the essential vulcanising agent is sulphur, but other vulcanising agents such as amine disulphides need not be excluded. The amount of sulphur in the compositions is typically from 2 to 6 parts, for example from 3 to 6, by weight per 100 parts by weight of rubber, but lesser or larger amounts, for example from 1 to 7 or 8 parts on the same basis, may be employed. A preferred range is from 2.5 to 4 parts per 100 parts by weight of rubber. An advantage of the bonding promoters of the invention over the conventionally used cobalt compounds is that they are effective at lower sulphur levels. The principal significance of this is that over the range of sulphur levels that gives vulcanisates of acceptable physical properties, those vulcanisates prepared using lower levels of sulphur show greater resistance to reversion and oxidative ageing than those prepared using higher levels of sulphur. Examples of vulcanisation accelerators which can be used in the present invention are the thiazole based accelerators, for example 2 mercaptobenzothiazole,bis 2 benzothiazolyl disulphide, 2 2 ,4 dinitrophenylthio benzothiazole, benzothiazole 2 sulphenamides for instance N isopropyl benzothiazole 2 sulphenamide, N tert butyl benzothiazole 2 sulphenamide, N cyclohexylbenzothiazole 2 sulphenamide, and 2 morpholinothio benzothiazole, and thiocarbamyl sulphenamides, for example N,N dimethyl N ,N dicyclohexylthiocarbamyl sulphenamide and N morpholinothiocarbonylthio morpholine. A single accelerator or a mixture of accelerators may be used. Best results are usually obtained using the benzothiazole 2 sulphenamides, especially those with relatively long induction times, for example N,N dicyclohexyl benzothiazole 2 sulphenamide and 2 morpholinothio benzothiazole. In the compositions of the invention, these are usually used in amounts of from 0.3 to 2, for example from 0.3 to 1.5, preferably from 0.4 to 1.0 and more preferably from 0.5 to 0.8, parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of rubber. The bonding promoters defined above are very effective in promoting bonding between rubber and brass, for example the bonding between rubber and brass coated steel. The brass typically has a copper content of from 60 to 70 by weight, more especially from 63 to 68 by weight, with the optimum percentage depending on the particular conditions under which the bond is formed. The brass coating on brass coated steel can have a thickness of, for example, from 0.05 to 1 micrometre, preferably from 0.07 to 0.7 micrometre, for example from 0.15 to 0.4 micrometre. Rubber can also be bonded effectively to alloys of copper and zinc containing small amounts of one or more other metals, for example cobalt, nickel or iron. Mixtures of different compounds of the above formula can be used as bonding promoters in a composite of the invention. Moreover, it is possible to use a mixture of such a compound with one or more of the organic thiosulphates which may contain more than one thiosulphate group disclosed in EP A 0 109 955. In a further variation, a compound of the invention, for example a sodium salt, can be used as a co promoter with a cobalt containing rubber metal bonding promoter other than a cobalt organo thiosulphate e.g. cobalt naphthenate. The amount of bonding promoter which, as indicated above, may be a single compound or a mixture, employed in the present invention is usually from 0.1 to 6 parts by weight, and preferably from 0.5 to 4, for example from 2 to 4, parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of rubber. The bonding promoters used in this invention can be incorporated into rubber by conventional mixing procedures, for example by adding them in a Banbury mixer or by adding them to the rubber on a mill. Ordinarily, with liquid or low melting solid additives, no special precautions are necessary for obtaining good dispersions. However, when using higher melting solids it is recommended that they be ground to a fine powder, preferably 70 micrometre particle size or less, to ensure adequate dispersion. In certain instances, it is convenient to add a solid promoter as a predispersion of particulate material in a rubber compatible hydrocarbon oil or polymer, for example EPDM rubber. Additives which are conventionally present in rubber compositions which are to be bonded to metal, are normally used in the vulcanisable compositions of the present invention. Such additives include carbon black, usually a carbon black of the N300 series such as N347 or N326, which typically is used in an amount of from 40 to 70 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of rubber. Other such additives are, for example, zinc oxide, which may be used in an amount of, for instance, from 2 to 10 or from 4 to 10 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of rubber stearic acid at a level of, for instance, from 0.5 to 2, for example from 1 to 2, parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of rubber hydrocarbon softeners and extender oils antidegradants, for example N alkyl N phenyl p phenylenediamines and tackifiers. Other fillers may be used, for example silica, and the rubber stocks may also contain metal oxide activators other than zinc oxide, for example magnesium oxide, other bonding agents or promoters, for example phenolic, resorcinol and or melamine adhesive resins, prevulcanisation inhibitors, for instance N cyclohexylthiophthalimide, and corrosion inhibitors, for example inhibitors based on boric acid, organic borates, inorganic borates such as sodium tetraborate, inorganic phosphates and chromates. The metal surface to which the rubber is to be bonded can be subjected to various pre treatments, for example to ensure complete cleanliness or to confer corrosion resistance. Evaluation of the adhesion promoters was carried out using a vulcanisable rubber composition of a type known as skimstock as follows Mixing of the components except sulphur and accelerator was done in a laboratory scale Banbury mixer having a capacity of 1.57 litre and operating at a filling factor of about 0.8 and a rotor speed of 117 r.p.m., according to the following schedule The batch was then transferred to a mill at 70 75 C for sheeting off. Sulphur and accelerator were added to portions of the masterbatch on a mill as required. The metal component was atypical brass coated steel tyre cord having the construction 3 9 15 x 0.175 1, each cord having a coating of brass, approximately 0.20 micrometre thick, with an average copper content of 63.5 by weight. Rubber metal bond strengths were measured using the adhesion test described by R.C. Ayerst and E.R. Rodger, Rubber Chem. Technol. The results given in the tables below under the headings Initial Adhesion , Steam Ageing and Salt Bath Ageing were obtained in adhesion blocks where the rubber was cured at 145 C. for T₉₀ 5 minutes, T₉₀ being the time in minutes taken for a sample of the same rubber cured in a rheometer British Standard Test Method 1673 Part 10 to reach 90 of the maximum modulus. Blocks that were steam aged were kept in steam under pressure at 120 C. for 8 hours and those that were salt bath aged were immersed in a 5 sodium chloride solution at 90 C for 48 hours after curing and before testing. In Steel Cord Analysis of Used Truck Tires and Simulation of the Found Phenomena in Laboratory Experiments an article in Tire Reinforcement and Tire Performance , ASTM STP 694, R.A. Fleming and D.I. Livingston, Eds, American Society for Testing and Materials, 1979, pp 69 86, C.C.J. de Jong concludes that in evaluating tyres and other composites containing metal and cord reinforcement, attention should be paid to aged adhesion rather than to initial adhesion. The ageing conditions mentioned above are similar to those proposed by de Jong to simulate, at an enhanced level, various conditions which might be encountered during the service life of a tyre. The preparation of compounds useful as bonding promoters in the invention is illustrated by the following Examples 2 Bromoethanol 52.9 g was added to sodium thiosulphate pentahydrate 106.7 g in ethanol 150 ml and water 150 ml and the mixture was refluxed for 30 minutes.

After 10 minutes at the boiling point a homogenous solution was obtained. Refluxing was continued for a further 5 minutes and the solution was then cooled to room temperature. The solvent was evaporated under vacuum until crystallisation began, and the solution was then cooled further to 4 C. Filtration gave 52.6 g of a white solid. The solid 43 g was purified by heating to about 50 C with absolute ethanol 400 ml , and filtering the solution at this temperature to remove undissolved solid. The filtrate was left at room temperature until crystallisation began and was then kept at refrigerator temperature for a further 12 hours. Filtration afforded 28 g of product. A cation exchange resin, Amberlite IRN 77, 230 ml was charged to a column and washed by passing distilled water through the column. A solution of nickel chloride hexahydrate 100 g per litre of water was then supplied to the top of the column and the supply was continued until the percolate leaving the base of the column appeared coloured.
