# Power transmission system and toothed belt therefor.

## Abstract
A synchronous power transmission system comprising a toothed belt and pulleys. The belt has teeth with convex curvi linear flanks shaped as a continuous curve defined by a mathe matical equation of at least the third degree so that the initial contact between each belt tooth and each pulley groove is sub stantially a point contact on the belt tooth flank.
