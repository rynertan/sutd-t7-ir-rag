# Coating process employs surfactants.

## Abstract
Incorporation of a fluorocarbon and a hydrocarbon surfactant in a photographic silver halide emulsion for high speed slide flow coating increases coating latitude by reducing a disruptive standing wave and allowing broader vacuum pressure ranges. The increased coating latitude is particularly advantageous at coating speeds above 100 meters per minute when the emulsion contains from 0.02 to 2 g of fluorocarbon surfactant per 1.5 moles of silver halide.
