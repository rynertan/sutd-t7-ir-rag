## Description
METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR IMPROVING pIE LINE WRITE TIME OF FxfFrTxDszArIC PRINTER PLCTTERS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of Invention This invention relates generally to electrostatic printer plotters and particularly to electrostatic printer plotters having a plurality of styli for forming an image from a plurality of dots.Description of the Prior Art An electrostatic printer plotter representative of the prior art is disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,417,391 filed June 8, 1982, and issued November 29, 1983. As disclosed in the patent, a raster scan across the recording head requires the sequential charging of 28 backplates opposite the recording head. The controller first turns on the first backplate, drives selected styli of 256 styli opposite the first backplate, then turns on the second backplate, drives selected styli of 256 styli opposite the second backplate and sequentially repeats until all 28 backplates have been charged and the scan across the recording head completed. Figure 1 discloses the sequential backplate charging as represented by a solid line, and the driving of selected styli, as represented by a dotted line, for ten backplates.A major disadvantage of the prior art is that each raster scan line requires the same amount of time irrespective of the image to be displayed. SUMMERY OF THE INVENTION This invention overcomes the disadvantages of the prior art and increases the print speed of electrostatic printer plotters through selectively decreasing the required write time per scan line by skipping the driving of selected styli and the charging of selected portions of backplates in response to detecting input data corresponding to a plurality of non displayable dots in the scan line.

DETAIrEsn DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODTMENIS Figure 1 shows the prior art method of backplate charging and styli selection for each scan line. Ref erring to Figure 2, a backplate charging and styli selection sequence in accordance with the invention is shown wherein three backplates shown as point I are skipped in response to the preferred eobodieent detecting data in an applied input data stream corresponding to a displayable raster line wherein the data indicates there are no displayable dots in the raster line corresponding to styli associated with backplates 4, 5 and 6. The preferred embodiment skips backplates 4, 5 and 6 and proceeds to backplate 7 thereby reducing the scan line writing time by the amount indicated by 2.Referring to Figure 3, another backplate charging and styli selection sequence in accordance with the invention is shown wherein the last half of backplate 3, backplate 4, the last half of backplate 6, backplate 7, backplate 8 and the first half of backplate 9 are skipped thereby reducing the raster line write time by an amount illustrated by point 3. Referring to Figure 4, a block diagram of an electrostatic printer plotter is shown. U.S. Patent 4,417,391, filed June 8, 1982, and issued November 29, 1983, to Rutherford et al is hereby incorporated by reference. The document entitled Service and Maintenance Manual published in February 1980 by Benson Varian of 385 Revendale Drive, Mountain View,California 94043 and subtitled Users Manual, Model 9326 Printer Piotter,Publication No. 03 996363B is incorporated herein by reference. The structure and operation of the preferred embodiment is substan tially as described in the incorporated references except for changes resulting from modifications to the INPUT CONTROL 20 and the WRITE CONTROL 30 as described hereafter. Referring to Figures 5 and 6, each bit of data corresponding to a scan line of an image to be displayed is applied to INPUT CONTROL 20 by theDMA CONTROLLER 40 as shown in step 300. The operations depicted in Figure 5 are implemented by bit counter 404 and zero counter 402 shown in Figure 6 and in part by firmware resident in Prom 230 of INPUT TLER 20. Prom 230 is more fully described in the incorporated Service and Maintenance Manual and inU.S. Patent 4,417,391 and is shown in Figure 4 of incorporated U.S. Patent 4,417,391. The input data applied includes a logic zero for each styli position which is not to be driven and does not correspond to a displayable dot and a logic one for each styli position which is to be driven and does correspond to a displayable dot.Step 400 determines whether the bit is a logic zero. If the bit is a logic zero, a zero counter 402 is updated in step 401 and the zero counter 402 updates a bit counter 404 shown in Figure 6. If the bit is not a logic zero, the count of the zero counter 402 is transmitted to the WRITE CONTRA 30 as shown by step 405. The zero counter 402 is then reset in 406 and in step 407 the logic one bit is sent to the WRITE CONTROL 30 and the bit counter 404. The bit counter 404 and the zero counter 402 are initializea to a zero count in response to signals from the DMX CUNTRULLER 40 and the R0L PANEL 11. Referring to the bit counter 404, the count of counter 404 shown inFigure 6 and step 401 shown in Figure 5, is tested by the INPUT CONTROL 20 in step 408 to determine if the bit count, shown as K in step 401 and step 408, exceeds the maximum bit count E X corresponding to the nuruber of styli in the head 48 for a given raster line. If the bit count does not exceed BC MAX then the INPUT CONTROL 20 reads the next bit as shown in step 300. If the count in bit counter 404 does exceed a xffiX then the input control in step 410 checks to see if the count in the zero counter 402 is zero.If it is, then an end signal is transmitted to the WRITE CONTROL 30 as shown in step 412. If the count in zero counter 402 is not zero, then the count in zero counter 402 and an end signal are transmitted to the WRITE CONTROL 30 as shown in step 414. Referring to Figure 5 of incorporated U.S. Patent4,417,391, the prom controlled sequencer 130 of the WRITE CONTROL 30 is initiated as shown in step 500 of Figure 7. The operations depicted in Figure 7 are implemented in part by firmware resident in Prom 143 of the WRITE CONTROL 30. Prom 143 is more fully described in the incorporated Service and Maintenaace Manual and in U.S.Patent 4,417,391 and is shown in Figure 5 of incorporated U.S. Patent 4,417,391. Referring again to Figure 7, the WRITE mNTROL 30 in step 502 receives a bit from the INPUT 03NTRQL 20. In step 503 the WRITE CONS 30 tests the bit to determine if the bit corresponds to the end signal generated in step 412 of Figure 5. If yes, then the operation is completed for the scan line, if no, then the WRITE CONTROL 30 in step 504 checks for a zero count transmitted from step 4Q5 of Figure 5. If there is no zero count, then the bit is transmitted in step 505 to the WRITE CONTROLLER 141, shown in Figure 5 of incorporated U.S. Patent 4,417,391, and step 502 is repeated. If there is a zero count, then the WRITS CONS 30 determines the zero count data transmitted in step 405 of Figure 5, initiates in step 507 a hardware terminate sequence resident in firmware within the prom 143. The WRITECONTROL 30 then sets a new write address as shown in step 508 and a writing sequence resident within the prom 143 is restarted, as shown in block 509, and step 502 repeated.
