# Stabilized poly arylene sulfide composition, process for melt extruding such composition and use of phenolic stabilizers in poly arylene sulfide resin.

## Abstract
The heat stability of arylene sulfide resins, such as poly p phenylene sulfide resin, is improved by the addition of cure re tarders comprising phenolic amide or ester based antioxi dants. The resin compositions of the invention are particularly applicable for reducing gel formation during melt extrusion.
