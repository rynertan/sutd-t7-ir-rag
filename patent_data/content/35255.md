# Process for removing trityl blocking groups from 5 O trityl nucleosides and oligonucleotides.

## Abstract
Trityl blocking groups from 5 O trityl nucleosides and oligonucleotides are removed by contacting said nucleo side or oligonucleotide with a Lewis acid. This process is especially useful in synthetic processes for producing oli gonucleotides and polynucleotides because the 5 O trityl groups are selectively removed without removing trityl blocking groups in 3 O position.
