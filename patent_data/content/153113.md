# THERMOSPRAY ION SAMPLING DEVICE

## Abstract
The performance of a thermospray ion source for liquid chromatograph mass spectrometers is improved dramatically by providing a voltage gradient across the thermospray jet stream to increase the efficiency of transferring ions of all masses from the thermospray jet stream to the mass spectrom eter, and in particular the intensity of high mass ions relative to low mass ions.
