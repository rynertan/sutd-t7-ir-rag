# Inflating device.

## Abstract
The invention relates to an inflating device containing a pressurized gas chamber arranged in a housing. To achieve small dimensions and a cheap structure, never the less maintaining a large capacity for the device, the pressure chamber constitutes a standard type of gas bulb 2 , a discharge duct 7 in communication with the chamber being formed to provide ejector action for inducting air via secondary air passages 11 leading from the duct 7 to the outside of the housing and suitably provided with non return valves.

## Description
INFLATING DEVICEThe present invention relates to an inflating device of the kind disclosed in the preamble to the following claim 1.Devices of this kind are already known. However, they have the drawback that they are large and clumsy as well as being expensive, and thus they have not come into any great use.This is particularly the case with such inflators for bicycles, where carrying a valuminous inflating device about all the time is hardly to be reckoned with. In devices for inflating automobile tires and different kinds of inflatable objects, it is difficult to provide a sufficiently large quantity of compressed air or gas. In addition to this, inflation with carbon dioxide in any great concentration is unsuitable since, inter alia, this gas permeates more readily than air through the wall of a rubber tube.The object of the present invention is to provide an inflating device, which is small in size, cheap to manufacture and use, which may even so be made in a single size, if necessary, to cover most of the above mentioned customarily prevailing applications.In accordance with the invention, this has been achieved by the inflating device having been given the characterizing features disclosed in claim 1. By using a separate gas container or bulb as a high pressure chamber, suitably an ordinary carbon dioxide bulb, which may be bought almost anywhere, and which may be stored for an unlimited time in its sealed state without losing pressure, a higher pressure may be permitted in the chamber. Should the gas or air quantity remaining in the bulb be found insufficient in some particular case, the used bulb may be removed and a filled spare bulb inserted instead, such a bulb taking up an insignificant amount of space in storage.The high pressure in such a cartridge is utilized by forming the discharge duct, in an inflating device in accordance with the invention, as an ejector means with side passages for the induction of secondary air into the discharge duct. For every part by volume of primare gas from the bulb, an addition of about 5 to 20 parts by volume of secondary air may thus be obtained.The quantity of secondary air does indeed taper off towards zero as the counter pressure at the nozzle of the discharge duct increases, and to prevent a reduction in the highest pressure attainable, occurring when the primary gas starts to depart via the side passages, which pressure is determined by the pressure in the bulb at the time in question, these passages are provided with non return valves, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, adopted for preventing leakage of gas through the side passages for a counter pressure of the nozzle which exceeds a valve determined by the configuration of the ejector means. The invention will now be described in the following in conjunction with the appended drawing, illustrating different embodiments thereof, and whereonFigure 1 is a perspective view,Figure 2 is a longitudinal section through a first embodiment of the device in accordance with the invention.Figure 3 is a partial section through a second embodiment, andFigure 4 is a partial section through a third embodiment in accordance with the invention.The embodiment illustrated of the inventive device in Figures 1 and 2 has a housing 1, in which a gas bulb 2 an ordinary carbon dioxide bulb is placed. At one end of the housing 1 there is an opening 3, through which the bulb is inserted and which is closed off by a hinged, J shaped member 4. In the position illustrated in Figure 3, this member 4 retains the bulb 2 in its correct position with its neck 5 thrust into an 0 ring 6, which seals the neck 5 so that the outlet of the bulb is in gas tight communication with a discharge duct 7 arranged in the housing 1. The discharge duct 7 passes through a nozzle 8 having a packing 9, adapted to the valve not shown of a bicycle inner tube, for example.The discharge duct 7 also includes a constricted portion 10 which, together with side passages 11 to the outside of the housing, and the packing 9 or a valve not shown inserted from the outside into the packing cr an ejector means.For every part by volume of gas flowing from the bulb 2 to the duct 7, about 5 parts by volume of secondary air are initially inducted via the orifices 11. If the counter pre at the nozzle 8 increases to a value decided by the form of the ejector means, this induction ceases and a further pres increase in the duct 7 is prevented by the gas from the bull being able to flow out via the side passages. If a higher pressure, up to the instantaneous pressure available from t bulb 2, is desired, it may be obtained easily by providing the side passages with simple non return valves 12, which prevent gas from flowing out of the side passages.A conventional valve 1 3 inside the neck 5 of the bulb is operated by a push rod 14 displaceably mounted in the close end of the housing 1, which may be depressed, against the bias of a spring 15, by the thumb of forefinger of the hand holding the device.Figure 3 functions in principle in the same way as the devi of Figures 1 and 2, but here a discharge nozzle 31 is arran coaxially with a housing 32 and displaceable therein agains the bias of a spring 33. A discharge tube 34 is attached to the nozzle 34, and extends through a rubber pad 36 such that a solid, pointed free end 35 of the tube 34 is in register with, and spaced from a sealed end 37 of a gas bul 38, which in this case is not provided with the otherwise customary valve corresponding to the valve 13 of Figure 2.When the nozzle is pressed against an object, e.g. a bicyc tire valve 39, it is displaced in the housing such that .he sharp end 35 penetrates the sealed end 37 of the zulb and gas can flow into the tube 34 via a slit 40 in the wall thereof, the slit 40 straddling the rubber pad 36 axially at this juncture, thus allowing gas to flow out of the nozzle 31 and to the tire valve 39. The discharge passage is here also formed as an ejector for inducting secondary air through side passages 41 provided with non return valves 42.In the embodiment illustrated in Figure 4, a gas bulb of the same kind was that in Figures 1 and 2 is used, and its valve 13 is operated by a similar push rod 14 as in saidFigures. As opposed to the embodiment according to Figures 1 and 2, a discharge duct 43 is arranged concentrically about the push rod 14 and normal to the end wall 44, where the duct merges into a radially directed, annular slit 45 opening out into an annular duct 46 provided with a radial discharge nozzle 47. At the juncture between slit 45 and duct 46 there are arranged substantially axial secondary air passages 48 extending through the end wall 44, and provided with non return flaps 49 on the inside surface of the end wall. An ejector means is thus formed in this case as well, where the gas flow reaches the speed of sound on deflection at the end wall 44, and a heavy induction of secondary air via the passages 48 is obtained, whereat up to 20 parts by volume of air for one part by volume of gas flowing from the bulb may be obtained.
