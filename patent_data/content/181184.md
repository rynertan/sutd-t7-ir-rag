# Drug dispenser.

## Abstract
A drug dispenser comprises a reservoir in which a drug substance is contained in solution. A tip or applicator is connected outside the reservoir and is in flow communication with an absorbent transfer member, which member sits in the reservoir and can absorb the drug solution and convey it to the tip. The arrangement is such that the drug solution is only able to leave the reservoir when contact is made between the tip and a solid surface, such as the body to be treated. On such contact a steady stream of drug solution can be applied to the solid surface by movement of the tip on the surface. The drug dispenser is designed to be used as a small hand held unit.

## Description
The present invention relates to the application of a drug solution and is particularly, but not exclusively suitable for use in the medical and vetinary treatment of the skin, mucous membranes. lips and related tissues.In the past treatment of skin complaints has usually been accomplished by the application of a drug preparation by means of cotton wool, fingers or a paint brush to which the solution or cream to be used is added by the user. None of these is able to regulate easily the quantity of preparation applied when the preparation is applied in liquid form. Creams applied with the fingers carry the additional problem of the risk of producing a secondary infection or introducing dirt to the skin complaint that is being treated, thus aggravating the situation.According to the invention there is provided a single unit comprising a reservoir containing a drug solution, an applicator permanently connected thereto in normal use, and means producing a steady release of the solution through the applicator on contact with the tissues to be treated. The invention also provides a method of drug delivery to tissues by topical application of a drug substance in solution by contact with a suitable tipped container having a reservoir of the drug solution in close or direct association with the tip.The invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawing, which is a cross section view of one embodiment of the invention.The illustrated unit comprises a reservoir 11 of a suitable material, such as plastics material, to contain a drug substance in solution. The reservoir is preferably shaped as illustrated. A transorb unit 12, which is a supporting membrane through which the drug solution may pass to the site of application, is disposed within the reservoir 11 in contact with the drug solution. The transorb unit is preferably of cellulosic material.A fibre tip, or other suitable tip, is mounted in the unit in direct contact with the transorb unit 12. The tip 13 provides for contact with the tissues being treated and acts as a carrier of the drug solution from the reservoir via the transorb unit 12. A closure unit 14 for the reservoir 11 fits snugly into the reservoir 11 to contain the drug solution and the transorb unit 12 and allows the tip 13 to protrude therethrough. A suitable capping device 15 encloses the exposed tip 13 when the unit is not in use to prevent loss of drug solution by evaporation or other methods from the exposed tip 13.For use the unit containing the drug solution 16 is inverted to allow the solution 16 to pass to the tip 13.The tip is then put in contact with the tissues to be treated, which automatically leaves drug solution on the tissues.The drug solution 16 will comprise a drug substance in solution wivh one or more of the following water, alcohol, propyleneglycol, glycerol, acetone, pyrroldones. The solution 16 may also contain suitable preservativesestabilisers a antioxidants. as may be necessary to preserve the particular drug and maintain its stability. The reservoir may be of any suitable size and material. However a preferred shape is a cylindrical vessel dosed at one end and open at the other. An appropriate size could be a length of 90mm and a diameter of 15mm. The transorb unit 12 would then also be cylindrical and may fit into the reservoir with a gap of about 1 2 mm between its outer surface and the inner surface of the reservoir. Such a unit would contain about 4ml of drug solution. The tip 13 can be of any suitable size, but is preferably a solid cylindrical shape with a tapered leading edge. A suitable size is about 25mm by 2,5mm diameter. It will be appreciated that this method can be used in any treatment from the application of anti sceptic material to a cut or sore to the treatment of serious skin complaints. This is achieved simply and without mess with a single unit.
