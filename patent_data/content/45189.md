# Electrical connector arrangement.

## Abstract
A first connector unit 30 has electrical terminals 31 expos has an insertion mouth 46 into which the first connector unit 30 ed at a rear upper surface portion. A second connector unit 40 is inserted as shown in Figure 6. The first connector unit 30 enters freely rotatable accommodation case 41 in the second connector untt 40 upon tnsertion. After insertion, electrical ter minals 31 of first connector unit 30 oppose but are spaced apart from electrical terminals 42 of second connector unit 40. By applying pressure p to the first connector unit 30, that unit is rotated as shown in Figure 7 and pressure contact is brought about between electrical terminals 31 and electrical terminals 42.
