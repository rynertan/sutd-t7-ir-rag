# A tent frame structure.

## Abstract
For a tent that is readily collapsible, erectible and portable, there is provided a roof structure. The structure has collapsible roof struts 30 . Each strut 30 has a first strut member 31 and a second strut member 33 where are pivotally connected to a respective one of first and second central carrier members 11, 13 . These central carrier members 11, 13 are arranged for relative displacement towards each other. Axial coupling means 22 align axially the central carrier members 11, 13 in a first position and in which the collapsible roof struts 30 extend outwardly from said first and second central carrier members 11, 13 . In their second position the carrier members 11, 13 are axially displaced from one another to enable said struts 30 to adopt a folded attitude in which the first and second strut members 31, 33 extend substantially axially of the first and second carrier members 11, 13 . Each central carrier member 11, 13 is a plate like member 12 with a central aperture 24 and a plurality of angularly spaced compartments 26 . First and second abutments 27, 28 on each compartment 26 to limit the movement of a respective strut member 31, 33 beyond the position occupied by that member in the first and second positions of the carrier members 11, 13 .
