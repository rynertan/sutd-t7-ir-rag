## Description
The present invention relates to a semiconductor laser array device which comprises a single semiconductor laser device having a plurality of resonators i.e., active waveguides for laser oscillation optically coupled therebetween, resulting in a semiconductor laser device with which high optical output power operation can be achieved. Phase synchronized laser arrays have been proposed in which a plurality of active waveguides are disposed in a parallel manner in a single semiconductor laser device to attain optical phase coupling therebetween, resulting in a laser device producing great output power with a single phase. One of these laser arrays is a CSP LOC channeled substrate planar large optical cavity laser device using a channeled substrate proposed by D. Botez et al., of RCA Laboratories, Fourth International Conference on Integrated Optics and Optical Fiber Communication, Abstract 29B5 2, June 27 30, 1983, Tokyo, Japan, which is shown in Figure 2. This laser device is produced as follows On an n GaAs substrate 11 having a plurality of striped V channels in a parallel manner thereon, an n GaAlAs cladding layer 12, an n GaAlAs optical guide layer 13, a GaAlAs active layer 14, a p GaAlAs cladding layer 15, and a p GaAs cap layer 16 are successively grown, followed by subjection to a vapor deposition treatment to form a SiOâ‚‚ insulating layer as an electric current blocking layer on the cap layer 16. Then, an ohmic electrode 18 is formed on the cap layer 16 and the insulating layer 17, resulting in the CSP LOC laser device. This laser device has the disadvantage that the amount of laser light absorbed into the GaAs substrate varies depending upon the distance from the active layer to the mesa portion of the substrate. If the distance between the active layer and the mesa portion of the GaAs substrate is small, the amount of laser light absorbed into the GaAs substrate becomes great so that the laser device cannot produce high output power. If the distance therebetween is great, the refractive index difference required for stable laser oscillation cannot be created. Thus, a zero shift in the optical phase between the adjacent laser operation areas is unattainable. It is an object of the present invention to provide a semiconductor laser array device in which the aforementioned disadvantages of the known devices are mitigated. A semiconductor laser array device of the present invention which overcomes the above discussed and numerous other disadvantages and deficiences of the prior art devices, comprises an active layer for laser oscillation having a plurality of curved portions at substantially right angles to the resonance direction to thereby create a distribution of the refractive index between the curved portions and the flat portions of said active layer, resulting in a plurality of laser oscillation operation areas which are positioned between the curved portions of said active layer and which are optically coupled therebetween. The curved portions of said active layer are, in a preferred embodiment, formed corresponding to a plurality of striped rectangular channels formed on a substrate. Thus, the invetion described herein makes possible the objects of 1 providing a semiconductor laser array device which is of an index guide type and which can minimize the loss of laser light at the region between the adjacent laser operation areas, thereby attaining stable optical phase coupling between the adjacent laser operation areas with a zero phase shift therebetween 2 providing a semiconductor laser array device in which a desired curvature of the curved portions of the active layer can be set to make a difference in the refractive index between the curved portions and the flat portions of the active layer, so that each of the resonators constituted between the curved portions of the active layer oscillates laser light in the fundamental transverse mode and 3 providing a semiconductor laser array device which is useful for a laser light source for long distance optical communication systems, due to the above mentioned advantages. The invention is described further hereinafter by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 shows a GaAlAs semiconductor laser array device of this invention, which is produced as follows On an n GaAs substrate 21, a plurality of striped rectangular channels 22 are formed in a parallel manner by photolithography. Then, on the channeled substrate 21, an n Ga When current is injected into the above mentioned laser array device through the ohmic electrodes 28 and 29, it flows into each of the p impurity diffusion regions 27 alone, and laser oscillation operation is carried out in the flat portions 241 of the active layer 24 corresponding to the said p impurity diffusion regions 27. As mentioned above, it is in the flat portions 241 of the active layer 24 corresponding to the regions other than those of the rectangular channels 22 of the substrate 21 that laser oscillation operation arises. The rectangular channels 22 function to separate the laser oscillation operation areas from each other. The striped rectangular channels 22 of the GaAs substrate 21 result in concaves on the n cladding layer 23, and accordingly the active layer 24 which is grown on the n cladding layer 23 serving as an underlying layer therefor has curved portions 240 corresponding to the rectangular channels 22. Figure 3 A shows the curved portions 240 of the active layer 24 in detail. Figure 3 B shows the distribution of the refractive index n corresponding to the active layer 24 shown in Figure 3 A . Due to the curved shape of the active layer 24, distribution of the refractive index n is achieved, corresponding to the curved portions 240 at right angles to the resonance direction, within the active layer 24, and each of the regions positioned between the curved portions 240 functions as an independent laser light resonator, which constitutes a laser oscillation operation area. Laser lights existing within the adjacent resonators attain optical phase coupling therebetween through the curved portion 240 of the active layer 24 therebetween, so that high output power laser lights can be emitted with a zero phase shift therebetween from the whole of the laser oscillation areas. That is, the flat portions 241 of the active layer 24 which correspond to the electroconductive regions 27 carry out laser oscillation operation, and laser lights created in each of the flat portions 241 ore transmitted to the adjacent laser oscillation operation areas to thereby attain optical phase coupling between the adjacent laser oscillation operation areas with a zero phase shift therebetween. The above mentioned Example discloses a GaAlAs semiconductor laser array device alone, but is not limited thereto. This invention is, of course, applicable to other semiconductor materials. Moreover, this invention is applicable to striped structures other than the planar striped structure described herein.
