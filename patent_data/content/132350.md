# A tool for cutting metal.

## Abstract
A shaper cutter includes an elongate body 11 , prefer ably conical, having teeth 12 formed around its periphery and a flexible wafer 18 is disposed against the end face of the body and is formed with peripheral teeth 19 overlying the teeth 12 on the body. The end face of the body is pre ferably concave and conical so that, when the center portion of the wafer is clamped to the body, the wafer flexes to lie against the end face with the result that the teeth 19 on the wafer 18 are held firmly against the teeth 12 on the body 11 . The edges of the teeth of the wafer constitute the cut ting edges of the cutter so that, when the cutting edges be come dull, the wafer 18 is simply removed and replaced with a new one. The teeth 19 of the wafer are larger at their ends 21 , sides 20 , and roots 22 than the corresponding teeth on the body. The wafer 18 is clamped between the bosy 11 and a ring 29 which is arranged entirely behind the pitch line P of the teeth 19 of the wafer 18 .
