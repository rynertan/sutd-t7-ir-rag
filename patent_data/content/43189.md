# Method of and apparatus for assessing coins.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a coin validator for use in a micro processor controlled call coin box telephone instru ment. The validator comprises first CS₁ and second CS₂ coil sets driven by square wave interrogation pulses. The arrangement of the coils is such that when a coin C is in the coin runway RW of the call coin box, one coil pair is used to interrogate the coin in the runway while the other coil pair provides environmental conditions apertaining to the run way. The information generated by both coil sets is com bined thereby compensating for environmental changes and drift.
