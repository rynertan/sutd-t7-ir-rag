# Method of preparing polycarbosilanes.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a method of preparing polycarbo silanes having high molecular weight and also having the major structural unit of silicon carbon linkage. The method comprises heating a polysilane at 50 600 C. in atmosphere of an inert gas and distilling out a low molecular weight polycarbosilane fraction having the number mean molecular weight of 300 600, followed by polymerizing the fraction by heating it at 250 500 C. in atmosphere of an inert gas. The polycarbosilane ob tained by the method of the present invention are useful for the precursor of preparing silicon carbide fibres and shaped articles.
