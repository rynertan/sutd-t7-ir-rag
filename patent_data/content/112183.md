# A METHOD OF PROVIDING A SEAL ON A CAPSULE

## Abstract
A method is disclosed for providing a seal on an edible capsule comprising hard shell, coaxially aligned cap and body parts which are telescopically joined thereby defining a junction seam, the capsule containing pharmaceutical ingre dients, which method is for the purpose of rendering such a capsule tamper resistant and tamper evident, the method comprising adhesively attaching a frangible, edible label over at least a portion of the seam, which label is adapted to cover regions either side of the seam in order that the label fractures upon displacement in any direction of the capsule parts with respect to each other.
