# Method and apparatus of manufacturing a tubular plastic container.

## Abstract
A tubular plastic container 11 having a molecularly oriented sidewall portion 11b is made by bringing the peripheral portion 10b of a solid blank 10 in engagement with the shoulder portion 3c of a die 3 , introducing the blank 10 into a cavity 3b of the die 3 while compressing with a first and second plungers 1, 2 , such that in the former stage of the introduction, the speed is relatively low and the pressure is relatively high, and then the speed is increased at a controlled rate and the pressure is decreased, thereby forming a hollow molded piece 15 , and then expanding the molded piece to bringing the sidewall portion 15a thereof into contract with the inner surface 3b₁ of the cavity. In the similar manner a tubular plastic container 201 having a sidewall portion formed with thick wall portions 202m axially extending and having a relatively large wall thickness and a large curvature, and thin wall portions 202n axially extending and having a relatively small wall thickness and a small curvature which are formed alternately in the circumferential direction, is made by using the second plunger 222 having recesses 222a₁ corresponding to the thick wall portions 202m and having open edge portions.
