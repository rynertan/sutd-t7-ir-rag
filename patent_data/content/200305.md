## Description
ANTIDANDRUFF SHAMPOOS AND METHOD TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention is related to antidandruff lotion shampoo compositions which possess good stability with respect to separation of the components and suspension of the antidandruff agent. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Lotion shampoos, both antidandruff as well as nondandruff types, are disclosed in the art. U.S. Patent 3,917,817,November 5, 1975 to Vanlerberghe et al. discloses a shampoo composition containing a piperazine based cationic polymer, 10 sodium alkyl sulfate, 4 lauryl monoethanolamide and 3 glycol distearate. U.S. Patent 4,013,787, March 22, 1977 toVanlerberghe et al. discloses a similar composition. JapaneseApplication, with Open for Public inspection Number 60810,May 19, 1977 Lion Fat s Oil , discloses shampoos containing 5 to 50 of an anionic surfactant, 18 to 10 of a fatty acid diethanol amide, 0.1 to 10 of an insoluble fine powder, and 1 to 10 of an ethyleneglycol ester. U.S.Patent 4,470,982, September 11, 1984 to Winkler discloses lotion antidandruff shampoos containing ethyleneglycol esters and an antidandruff agent. While these references, all of which are incorporated herein by reference, disclose compositions which contain components similar to those present in the compositions of the present invention, they do not suggest the advantages found by the present inventor for the compositions disclosed herein. It is an object of the present invention, therefore, to provide shampoos containing specific ethyleneglycol esters to serve as a suspending agent for a particulate antidandruff agent. The selected ethylene glycol esters can be used at lower levels than other ethylene glycol esters with the result being less interference with the deposition of the antidandruff active. It is a further object of the present invention to provide effective antidandruff shampoos utilizing reduced levels of the antidandruff actives. It is still a further object of the present invention to provide antidandruff shampoos exhibiting improved stability. These and other objects will become readily apparent from the detailed description which follows. All percentages and ratios herein are by weight unless otherwise indicated. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to antidandruff lotion shampoo compositions comprising from about 5 to about 30 of a surfactant, from about 0.5 to about 4 of an ethyleneglycol ester suspending agent, from about 1 to about 78 of an amide, from about 0,18 to about 3 of a particulate antidandruff agent and water. The compositions exhibit improved stability with respect to separation of the components while providing excellent antidandruff efficacy.

Many additional nonsoap surfactants are described inMcCUTCHEON S, DETERGENTS AND EMULSIFIERS, 1983 Annual, published by Allured Publishing Corporation, which is incorporated herein by reference. The above mentioned surfactants can be used alone or in combination in the shampoo compositions of the present invention.The anionic surfactants, particularly the alkyl sulfates, the ethoxylated alkyl sulfates and mixtures thereof are preferred for use herein as well as the amido betaines.Ethylene Glycol Ester The ethylene glycol esters found useful in the compositions of the present invention are diesters wherein the esters are a mixture of palmitate and stearate. The amount of stearate should be in the range of about 10 to about 42 or in the range of about 55 to about 80 with pea imitate accounting for the remainder. The amount of stearate is preferably from about 60 to about 75 . The amount of the ester useful in the present invention is from about 0.5 to about 4 , preferably from about 1 to about 4 . It has been surprisingly found that these levels provide for improved stability whereas materials not meeting the ester requirement would have to be used at much higher levels to achieve similar stability.Amide The amide used in the present compositions can be any of the alkanolamides of fatty acids known for use in shampoos.These are generally mono and diethanolamides of fatty acids having from about 8 to about 14 carbon atoms.

Included among such agents are 2 zinc pyridinethione and other 1 hydroxy pyridinethiones such as those disclosed in U.S. Patent 2,809,971,October 15, 1957 to Bernstein, U.S. Patent 3,236,733,February 22, 1966 to Karsten, et al., U.S. Patent 3,753,196, August 21, 1973 to Parran, U.S. Patent 3,761,418, September 25, t973 to Parran and U.S. Patent 4,379,753, April 12, 1983 toBolich, Jr. All of these patents are incorporated herein by reference. Preferred pyridinethione salts are those having a median particle diameter of at least 1.2 microns. Also preferred are the metal salt pyridinethione salts of the type disclosed in the 753 patent to Bolich, Jr. Zinc pyridinethione is the preferred agent, particularly where its salt crystals are predominantly flat platelets which have a mean sphericity less than about 0.65, preferably between about 0.20 and about 0.65, and a individual median particle diameter of at least about 2 e, expressed as the diameter of a sphere of equivalent volume. The diameter of a sphere of equivalent volume, dv, for a particle can be determined by a variety of sedimentation techniques which are based on Stokes Law for the settling velocity of a particle in a fluid. Such techniques are described in Stockham,J. D. and Fochtman, E. G., Particle Size Analysis, Ann ArborScience, 1978, incorporated herein by reference. The sphericity of a particle is also described by Stock ham and Fochtman at page 113 asEMI9.1 where dv is the diameter of a sphere of equivalent volume, supra, and d5 is the diameter of a sphere of equivalent area. A technique for determining d5 is the BET technique described byStockham and Fochtman at page 122. Since the sphericity of interest herein is the mean sphericity, the mean diameters are employed. The particulate antidandruff agent is present at a level of 0.18 to about 3t, preferably from about 0.3 to about 2 .Water Water is the remaining essential component of the present compositions and is present at a level of from about 50 to about 80 , preferably from about 60 to about 75 .
