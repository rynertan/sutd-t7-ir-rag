## Description
SPRING SUPPORT DEVICE This invention relates to a spring support device for resiliently supporting a pipe, cable, or the like. Typically, a known support device for pipes comprises a tubular body of steel having opposed end plates which provides a housing for a load carrying spring unit. Examples of support devices of this kind are shown in British patent specifications Nos, 991684 and 1329076. Such devices will hereinafter be referred to as devices of the kind defined. In order to ensure that a device of this kind is corrosion resistant the body and end plates are first galvanised and the end plates are then welded to the body following assembly of the spring unit. Since, in use, the end plates are under stress it is important that the welded seams are of high quality. Difficulty has been experienced in obtaining high quality welded seams on components that have been previously galvanised. Moreover, after welding it is necessary to treat the joint with Galvafroid TradeMark of Expandite Ltd. or some similar material. It is an object of the present invention to overcome the problem mentioned above and to simplify the method of manufacture and assembly of support devices of the kind defined. According to this invention a spring support device for resiliently supporting a pipe, cable, or the like comprises a tubular metal body having first and second ends, first and second opposed end plates housed within the body respectively adjacent to the first and second ends, a load carrying spring unit housed within the body between the end plates, and a plurality of circumferentially spaced abutments integrally connected to the tubular body adjacent to the first end and projecting radially inwardly of the body for engagement by the first end plate for axially locating the first end plate in the body against axially outward movement relative to the body. Preferably, the body is cylindrical but may be of square or other section. The body is preferably of steel but other metals may be found suitable. A further series of circumferentially spaced abutments may be provided adjacent to the second end of the body for engagement by the second plate. Each abutment may comprise a portion of the tubular body which has been deformed radially inwardly of the body. Preferably, the body portion has a generally axially inwardly facing free edge for engagement by an end plate. The body portion is preferably formed by partially severing a portion of the body wall and bending said portion inwardly to provide a portion which is substantially S shaped in axial cross section. The first and second end plates may be provided with a series of circumferentially spaced cut outs corresponding to the abutments for permitting assembly of the end plates by aligning the abutments and cutouts and moving the plates axially past the abutments. A second aspect of the invention is concerned with a method of forming a spring support device body for a spring support device of the kind defined comprising the step of taking a length of metal tube and punching circumferentially spaced portions of the tube adjacent to at least a first end thereof so as to produce radially inward protruding projections adjacent to the first end and provide circumferentially spaced abutments integrally connected to the body for locating at least one end plate. Preferably, the method comprises the step of forming the abutments by piercing the tube during a punching operation so that each projection has an axially inwardly facing free edge. The body can be galvanised subsequent to the punching step. Where the device is to be used for supporting loads acting vertically it may assist assembly if at least the upper end plate is provided with additional means of location. The additional means may be a pin or screw extending through the body wall into an adjacent edge portion of the end plate. An embodiment of the invention will now be described by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a side elevation of a variable spring support device according to this invention as viewed along arrow A of Figure 2 Figure 2 is a plan view of the device of Figure 1 Figure 3 is a cross section on the line Ill Ill of Figure 2 and Figure 4 is an enlarged detail of Figure 3. The drawings show a variable load support device 1 incorporating a scale 2 for indicating the value of the load supported or the deflection under load. The support device is designed as a pipe or cable hanger and is intended to be mounted for supporting variable loads acting in a substantially vertical direction.The support 1 comprises a steel, tubular body 3 of round section which is closed at the top by a circular end plate 4 and provided at the bottom with an annular end plate or ring 5 having a central aperture 15 which allows a turnbuckle 7 to pass through the ring. A load carrying coil spring 6 is mounted on the ring 5 within the body 3 and supports the turnbuckle 7 which is adjustably connected by a screw threaded rod 16 to a circular load bearing plate 8 which rests freely on the upper end of the spring 6 between the top end plate 4 and the bottom end plate 5. The bottom end plate 5 is a loose fit within the body 3 and rests freely on four abutments 9 equi spaced around the inside face of the body wall adjacent to the bottom end thereof. Similarly, the top end plate 4 is a loose fit in the body 3 and engages four equi spaced abutments 9 adjacent to the upper end thereof.Optionally, the top end plate 4 maybe held in position by several pins 10 extending through the body wall into holes in adjacent edge positions of the top end plate.The equi spaced abutments 9 are formed integrally with the body wall by punching flutes from the outside so that strong load bearing edge portions are formed internally which face axially inwards towards each other. As shown in Figure 4, the flutes are of substantially S shaped in axial cross section. In this example the top end plate 4 carries a rectangular lug 11 for connecting the device 1 to a rigid support structure but any other suitable form of connection may be employed. A slot 12 is provided in the wall of the body for an adjustable stop 13 for the plate 8 which enables the load to bepre set. The load on the spring 6 is indicated by the position of the plate 8 relative to the external scale 2. An important feature of this invention is the simplification of manufacture and assembly of support devices of the kind defined and it will be appreciated from the foregoing description and the drawings that each of the component parts of the device may be galvanised separately, or otherwise coated, before assembly to resist corrosion. The device may then be assembled for se by inserting into the tubular body 3 firstly the bottom plate 5, which is manipulated edgewise past the abutments 9 to rest on the axially directed free edges thereof at the bottom end of the body 3, then the spring 6 and the load bearing plate 8 are inserted and finally the top plate 4 is manipulated edgewise past the spaced abutments 9. The top plate 4 maybe additionally located by the pins 10 to prevent it from dropping when the device is not under load but it has been found in practice that this is not strictly necessary. The lower end portion of the turnbuckle 7 extends through the central aperture 15 in the bottom plate and is connected to the pipe not shown to be supported. It can be screwed vertically on the rod 16 for adjusting the support relative to the pipe. When the support 1 is under load the top and bottom end plates 4, 5 as well as the load bearing plate 8 are all firmly held in the positions shown in Figure 2. Notches may be provided in the edges of the end plates 4, 5 to facilitate manipulation past the abutments 9 during assembly by aligning the abutments and cut outs and moving the plates axially past the abutments. With the arrangement provided by this invention there is no need for any welding operations to secure the top and bottom plates, which are analogous to the fixed end plates of the prior art devices, to the housing 3 and therefore no need to treat the welded parts with Galvafroid or similar anti corrosion material. Moreover, there is a saving of time and hence costs in manufacture whilst providing strong integral abutment faces for supporting vertical loads. It will be appreciated that the size of the device and its load bearing capacity may be varied and minor modifications such as the type of lug connection 11 and the number of abutments 9 may be changed accordingly without departing from the scope of the invention. It is to be understood that the invention may be adapted for use in spring support devices wherein the loads act in a substantially horizontal direction.
