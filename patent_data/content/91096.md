# Valve operating system of internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
A valve operating system 10 of an internal combustion engine comprises a rocker arm 22 disposed swingable relative to a rocker arm shaft 14 , and having a first end portion 22a co operative with an operating cam 18 and a second end portion 22b co operative with a valve stem 30 . The rocker arm 22 is formed at its central part with a bearing section 24 at which the rocker arm is swingably supported on the rocker arm shaft. The bearing section 24 is contactable with and elongates along the outer peripheral surface of the rocker arm shaft 14 . Additionally, the valve operating system 10 is so arranged that engine lubricating oil is supplied under pressure into between the rocker arm bearing section 24 and the rocker arm shaft 14 , thereby rendering the valve clearance C zero in order to reduce noise generation from the valve operating system 10 .
