## Description
SEALING THICK ANODIC COATINGS ON ALUMINIUM SUBSTRATES Description Technical FieldThis invention relates to substrates for printed circuit boards. More particularly, it relates to producing thick anodic films on aluminium in an improved manner, such that the film is suitable for subsequent circuit pattern generation thereon. Background ArtAluminium and aluminium alloys have long been anodically treated in a suitable electrolyte to produce an oxide layer y A12O3, the thickness, appearance and morphology of which depend on processing factors such as time, temperature and electrolyte type. Anodizing has been used extensively in commercial applications to provide decorative and protective finishes for aluminium. Anodizing has also been used to increase surface hardness and wear resistance of aluminium.Anodized aluminium has been used to provide insulating layers in electrolytic capacitors.More recently, anodized aluminium has been used as the base material for electronic circuitry applications. A one sided microcircuitized substrate comprising a combination of anodized aluminium at a thickness of 25 m and an equally thick epoxy layer. Some substrates having thicker anodized layers are also known.Thick anodized aluminium layers, between 100 to l50 m have been demonstrated to be porous and to have microcraks or to develop same on heating. As a result of the difference in the thermal coefficients of expansion between the anodic coating and the base material, the presence of these flaws decreases greatly the dielectric strength of anodized aluminium coatings. Such flaws may be filled with air and other gases which, upon application of an electric field, ionize and conduct electric currents.Many techniques have been developed for sealing anodic oxide coatings according to Wernick et al in Surface Treatment ofAluminium Disclosure of InventionIn the present invention, the aluminium substrate is subjected to surface treatment for cleaning and etching. After a rinse in tap water, the substrate is anodized to obtain a 100 to 150m coating thickness. Following another tap water rinse, a new sealing step is performed by reacting the anodic coating with colloidal silica. The substrates are then ready to receive circuit patterns. Best Mode for Carrying Out the InventionThe aluminium surface is simultaneously cleaned and etched in the following solution phosphoric acid 80 by volume nitric acid 5 by volume oxalic acid 3 grams by weight and water 15 by volume.The solution is heated to 820 C and the aluminium work piece is immersed for two to three minutes. A rinse in tap water follows. To anodize the aluminium work piece, it is treated in a conventional hard anodizing bath preferably in a dilute solution consisting of sulfuric acid. ...25 5m Q oxalic acid 8 2gel urea lg Q and a low foaming surfactant of the phosphate ester emulsifier TM TM type such as Tryfac 5569 or Tryfac 610 A from EmeryIndustries.The aluminium work piece is treated for 45 60 minutes at a temperature between 0 and 50 C and at current density of 1 2 2 amp dm . This current density is maintained by varying the applied voltage. A coating thickness of 75Am to 125 m results.The work piece is again rinsed in tap water. The sealing step requires reacting the anodized coating with colloidal silica, TM known as LUDOX , of E.I. DuPont De Nemours and Company, is a form of such colloidal silica. Ammoniated LUDOX of the negatively charged AS type having a particle size of approximatively 22nm is preferred. The anodized aluminium work piece is electrolytically treated in an acidified solution ofLUDOX. The pH of the solution is maintained between 3 and 4. A treatment time of 20 30 minutes at room temperature is preferred. The LUDOX solution consists of 150 to 500 ml ofLUDOX as, 1000 ml of distilled water, and acidified to a pH of 3 to 4 with concentrated sulfuric acid using vigorous agitation. The above described process produces substrates having an anodic coating of increased dielectric strength as compared to unsealed coatings.The sealing step is accomplished by using the anodized aluminium work piece as anodes in an electrolytic cell. A 2 current density of 100 200 mamp dm and a duration of 20 minutes minimum at room temperature is preferred.This sealing step utilizes a method in which cracks in the anodic coating are filled with polymerized silica having a thermal coefficient of expansion substantially comparable of that of the coating.
