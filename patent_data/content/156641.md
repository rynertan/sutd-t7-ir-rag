# Enzymic method of detecting analytes and novel substrates therefor.

## Abstract
A shall enzymically inactive peptide fragment of an en zyme e.g. ribonuclease S peptide is used as the label and conjugated with the complementary fragment S protein to form an enzyme which catalyses a primary reaction whose product is, or leads to, an essential coenzyme or prosthetic group for a second enzyme which catalyses a secondary re action leading to a detectable result indicating the presence of analyte. Also disclosed are novel synthetic substrates for the primary reaction. Substrates for ribonuclease S conjugate enzyme are of the formula R X where R is a pyrimidine 3 phosphate moiety and X is a leaving group linked to R through the 3 phosphate group and leads to said coenzyme or prosthetic group, e.g. via riboflavin, thiamine, pyridoxal, pyridoxine or pyridoxine phosphate.
