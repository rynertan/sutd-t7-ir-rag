# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MACHINING BORES

## Abstract
A thin workpiece bore wall separating the bore from an adjacent internal passage is machined with a tool expandable against the wall while the adjacent passage is fluid pressur ized to exert a pressure on the thin wall counter to the distort ing force exerted by the expandable tool on the wall during machining. Bore geometry is thereby improved.
