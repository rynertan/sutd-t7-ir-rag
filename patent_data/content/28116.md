# Battery jar cover system.

## Abstract
A battery jar cover and a system for welding the battery jar cover onto a battery jar with the battery elements and terminal post in position within the jar and with the cover placed in posi tion. The battery jar cover 10 has a guide device 34 compris ing posts 36 and flanges 38 depending from the bottom thereof and positioned so as to extend about at least predeter mined portions of the periphery of the cover and inwardly from the sides thereof. The guide device is shaped so that it extends downwardly from the bottom of the cover a greater degree ad jacent the corners and to a lesser degree adjacent the central position of each side. The system includes a welding apparatus 100 that includes a deck assembly 114 , a carriage assembly 116 and a welding head assembly 118 . The apparatus fur ther employs separate heating and clamping mechanisms 444 , 420 extending on each side of the jar so that the cover does not have to be lifted completely off the jar during welding. This structure greatly reduces the time required to change over from one size to another thereby increasing the per unit processing capacity of the device. Further, in order that a var iety of jar sizes be rapidly handled, two of the heating and clamping mechanisms are relatively long while the other two are relatively short and equal to the constant width dimension of batteries. The apparatus accomplishes the loading opera tion automatically, and by not removing the cover fully from the jar, better and more accurate welds are produced.

## Description
Title BATTERY JAR COVER SYSTEMDescription This invention relates to a unique battery jar cover and the method and apparatus for making same. The cover has been designed to be welded onto a battery jar by means of automatic heat sealing equipment A storage battery includes an outer jar of suitable norr current conducting and acid resisting material into which convey tional battery elements and terminal posts are placed and which is closed by the cover described herein. The welding of this cover to battery jars is accomplished in a more efficient and effective manner by the improved method and apparatus disclosed herein and made possible by this cover structure. It is desirable when preparing a battery jar structure that the cover be effectively sealed around its periphery to the top of the battery jar so that notwithstanding service conditions, including temperature extremes, vibrations, or other environmental conditions, the seal between the cover and the rim of the battery jar remain intact. Thus, a substantially permanent, hermetic seal is desired which is acid proof and which can resist at least the above service conditions, while at the same time providing strength at the joint It is also desirable, to the extent possible, to automate the process of welding battery jar covers onto battery jars. One difficulty in this regard, is created by the fact that the battery jars have electrodes in place so that their terminal posts extend up wardly beyond the plane established by the upper rim of the battery.Battery covers have been glued or sealed onto battery jars by means of epoxy adhesives or by ultrasonic welding. In many cases the ultrasonic process is not capable of producing a hermetically sealed container at the point of the weld especially where there are thick or complicated tongue and groove type joints since such structures are believed difficult to penetrate with the ultrasonic waves. Thus, acid leaks can occur at points along the weld or from poorly secured areas where the thickness to be penetrated was too great to provide a completely solid weld. Ultrasonic welding requires the material be relatively stiff and works best where the ultrasonic electrodes can be on opposite sides of the work piece.Accordingly use along corner structures, as would be required when welding battery covers onto battery jars, provides a difficult set of conditions which would have to be overcome in order to produce a good weld. Likewise, glueing procedures do not always result in a continuous hermetically sealed joint around the entire structure and in some cases requires the cover to be turned upside down so that glue can be placed in the groove into which the battery jar rim is ultimately placed after the whole jar has been inverted. Further, in many bonding techniques currently in use the cover must be lifted entirely off of the battery jar and away from the terminals so that a heating platen, provided with a central cut out portion capable of fitting over the terminals, can be brought in and lowered into position to heat the joint even. After melting the heater is removed and the cover is finally brought back in place where it is held until the jar area is cooled. The time lag in such procedures is relatively long and some cooling and oxidizing of the plastic can occur, which is undesirablee Further as the sidewalls of battery jars become increas ingly thinner, there is a greater likelihood that the jar s sidewalls will bow inwardly and this problem becomes compounded as the size of the battery jar increases.Thus, the problems of automating battery production would seem to be further compounded Therefore, it is a primary object of the inventors to provide an improved battery jar which lends itself to being auto magically welded in place by the heat sealing techniques to be described and which assures correct alignment between the cover and the battery jar. With respect to methods and apparatus for forming battery jar covers onto battery cases or jars, such are known in the art. Thus, these devices have, in the past, solved the problem of how to weld around terminal posts which extend upwardly beyond the plane established by the rim of the battery jar by employing one piece heating elements shaped to be equal to the size of the periphery of the jar rim of a particular jar on which a cover is being welded. Such heating elements have either had a hollow interior or were provided with properly positioned holes through which the terminal posts could extend. Such heating elements were usually fed horizontally from along side the welding area after the cover had been lifted completely off of the battery jar and out of engagement with the terminal posts.Following the insertion of the one piece heating platen from the side, the platen and the cover would again be lowered over the terminal posts and back onto the jar with the platen now occupying a position between the upper edge of the jar and the bottom of the cover. Following heating, the battery cover would again be lifted completely off and away from the battery jar and the terminal posts so that the heating platen could be raised away from the jar and above the tops of the terminal posts after which it could be withdrawn horizontally with the cover being lowered thereafter into place so that the welding process could be completed. The complete removal of the battery cover from the battery jar and its subsequent travel back and forth during heating and welding to allow for the insertion and removal of the heating platen complicates the welding process in a number of ways not the least of which is that when the cover is removed the initial align ment provided by having the cover in the jar is lost and additional alignment problems can result It should be kept in mind that as the sidewall thickness of battery jars decreases there is a tendency for such sidewalls to flex inwardly or outwardly and accordingly, at least to some extent, the cover helps stabilize and shape the side walls of the battery jar.When the cover is completely removed, it is possible for the sidewalls of the battery jar to become distorted so that during the heating process when the cover is not continuously in the jar, both the jar and the cover may be irregularly melted. In addition, it is known that an oxidized surface can be formed on melted thermoplastic or plastic materials when exposed to air. Likewise, the heating of the plastic to its fusion temperature also tends to degrade the plastic adjacent the heating platen. Thus, the longer the melted surfaces remain exposed to the atmosphere the greater the problems associated therewith. Further, to produce clean and strong joints between the melted areas it is important to have clean non degraded melted material within the joint.Accordingly, by raising the cover and waiting while the platen is removed and moving the cover back into the jar, even assuming acceptable alignment is again obtained, the relatively long period of time that both the jar and cover have remained exposed increases the inevitability of having weld failures result due to the relatively long exposure tim es Also, since the platens were one piece elements, each could only be shaped or sized for one or a small grouping of battery sizes. While there are two relatively standard width sizes for battery jars there are a wide variety of lengths used in industry. Accordingly, each change from one size or one group to another required such machines to be out of service for relatively long periods while the platens were exchanged and the machine recalibrated. Accordingly, it is another primary objective of the present invention to provide a device which will allow the welding of improved battery covers onto battery jars in a way that does not require the cover to be completely removed from the jar during the welding operation. An additional objective is the development of a welding device that allows the processing of a wide number of jar sizes, both with respect to the height of the jar and their length and width dimensions, by making it a relatively simple matter to change from one set of jar parameters to another in a short time. The cover of the present invention includes a primary plate structure which has a constant dimension in the width direc tion with a varying length. In the battery field it is common to have the width of the battery kept relatively constant and we have found this constant width can be either 6.19 inches or 6.25 inches as commonly used in the industry although the concept set forth herein would apply equally as well to any battery regardless of its dimensions. The length of the battery to which the present invention is directed varies, preferably, from about 2 inches to about 12 inches, although, here again, additional lengths greater or smaller than those within this range could also apply. The cover is molded from a thermoplastic material, preferably polypropylene, although other thermoplastic materials could be used, according to conventional injection molding tec niques, so that it is formed into a fairly rigid plate structure having the desired dimensions. The cover is provided with a centrally located opening that will later be used as a vent hole for the battery and enough other terminal post holes, arranged in a predetermined pattern, for enclosing the terminal posts from the electrodes within the battery jar. The top of the cover is normally either flat or provided with a recessed outer rim area and the dimensions of the cover should be substantively identical to the outer dimensions of the battery jar to which it will be welded. The bottom side of the cover is provided with an alignment device or member which is spaced inwardly away from the outher edges of the cover but extends in a relatively uniform or regular manner around the periphery of the cover so that at least predetermined portions thereof will come into contact and engage the interior wall surface of the battery jar to which it will be secured. In the preferred embodiment, the alignment device is comprised of a flange or skirt member which extends continuously about the periphery of the cover, but again is spaced inwardly from the outer edges of the cover a first predetermined distance so that a portion of the horizontal bottom surface of the cover extends from that skirt to the outer edge. At least part of this horizontal surface will ultimately become part of the horizontal weld area once the cover is welded onto the battery jar structure. At spaced intervals along the skirt, guide pins are pr vided which are thicker than the flange so that they extend over both sides of the skirt. While the skirt itself could be made thicker, it is important that the guide pins extend outwardly from the outer vertical surfaces of the skirt, toward the edges of the cover, so that it is the outer surface of the guide pins which contacts the interior surface of the battery jar. Thus, a gap or space is formed between the outer surfaces of the skirt and the inner surface of the battery jar.As will be more fully explained hereinafter, it is that space or gap between the flange or skirt and the inner wall of the battery jar that allows consistently uniform welds around the entire seam between the cover and the battery jar and which also allows the melted thermoplastic material to flow therethrough so that any such material which has been degraded during the heating or melting operation can flow out of the joint area so that fresh or clean thermoplastic material will be available from both the cover and jar surfaces to produce a uniform weld.Further, during the heating, as will be also more fully explained hereinafter, a portion of the guide pins will be melted away and the outer surface of the skirt will be softened so that a secondary weld, and in particular, a vertical weld, will be formed between the skirt, the portion of the melted guide bars and a portion of the vertical interior surface of the battery jar adjacent the rim. The apparatus for joining the cover to the battery case or jar includes a main frame and is comprised of a deck area along which battery jars with their covers in place can be moved from a load station to weld and unload stations by a transfer carriage mechanism in a sequential manner. Positioned directly above the weld station is a vertically moving welding head. There is an initial adjustment that can be made to properly position the welding head for the height of jars to be processed and the welding head itself is initially raised or lowered to a correct welding height. Independent of that vertical adjustment, the welding head is under the control of two other raising and lowering drive systems. One moves the welding head to allow sufficient clearance for jars to be moved along the deck area beneath the weld head between welding cycles.During welding, the weld head itself is movable between a series of secondary raised and lowered positions to allow for insertion of separated heating bars as will be more fully described hereafter. The weld head itself is comprised of a primary horizontal mounting plate on which four separate vertically oriented mounting plates are secured so that they can be moved toward and away from the central portion of that primary mounting plate. Two of those vertically oriented mounting plates are relatively long and of an equal length whereas the other two mounting plates are relatively short and are equal to the width dimension of the jars. Thus, the pair of short plates fit between the two longer mounting plates.As the length of battery jars varies, the two smaller plates can be moved inwardly or outwardly away from each other and toward or away from the center of the horizontal mounting plate a distance necessary to correspond to the new length dimension. When properly spaced they are again fixed in place and the longer sides are bought back into engagement with each of the shorter plates and processing can continue. Each of these four vertical mounting plates supports a separate heating and clamping assembly. Each of the clamping assemblies are pivotally attached to the mounting plates whereas the heating assemblies are attached so that they can be both pivoted and moved vertically independently of the clamping assembly, the mounting plate and of the welding head itself. The bottom of each of these vertical mounting plates is designed to receive a rail member which will be in a locked condition with the covers periphery during welding. The heating and clamping areas of The heating and clamping assemblies are positioned beneath the rail member with the clamp bar of the clamp assembly being positioned below the heating bar of the heating assembly so that the heating member lies between the bottom of the rail and the top of the clamp.This arrangement allows the clamps to engage each sidewall of the jar and after the cover is locked in the rail members it can be lifted along the welding head a distance slightly greater than the thickness of the heater bar which can then be pivoted into a position between the cover the jar. Battery jars with their elements and covers in place are sequentially loaded onto the deck at the load station and the transfer carriage will sequentially index a jar to the weld station directly beneath the welding head. Prior to the actuation of the transfer carriage assembly, the welding head is moved to its uppermost loading position which allows full clearance for battery jars to be moved thereunder. Once a jar is in place the welding head is moved down into its operating position. The clamp drive means is actuated to substantially simultaneously bring each of the four clamps into an engagement with one of the sidewalls of the battery jar which finalizes alignment of the sidewalls with the cover and brings the cover and jar assembly into vertical alignment with the center line of the welding head.The clamps are attached to and moved with the welding head itself and, accordingly, the clamps remain engaged with the sidewalls throughout the remainder of the welding process. Once the clamps have been engaged the cover will be bought into an engagement against the rails which are located at the lower edges of the vertical mounting plates so that the cover itself will now also be moved together with the welding head and clamps and these will remain integrally locked together until the welding process has been completed. The welding head is slightly raised a distance which is just sufficient to allow the four separate heating members to be placed between the cover and the upper rim of the battery jar but not so great as to remove the cover from within the battery jar so that alignment between the cover and the jar 5 sidewalls is maintained.The heaters can be raised into an engagement with the cover or positioned to engage the cover and jar at about the same time or to contact the jar first. However, after the heaters are pivoted into position the welding head together with the heaters are lowered into the heating position where the heater contacts the cover and the jar. After a predetermined melt period during which heating occurs the movement of the weld head is reversed and as the heater blades are withdrawing the weld head is being lowered to bring the two melted areas into an engagement to complete the weld with the rail members applying pressure to the melted joint. Through such a procedure it is possible to melt the appropriate areas of the battery cover and the battery jar and to bring these melted areas into an engagement extremely quickly and substantially simultaneously with the withdrawal of the heaters so that very little time has been exposed to the atmosphere. Other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will become fully apparent from the following description, the appended claims and the accompanying drawings in which FIGURE 1 is a top plan view of one illustrative embodiment of the cover according to the present invention FIGURE 2 is a bottom plan view of the cover shown inFIGURE 1 FIGURE 3 is an end view of the cover shown in FIGURE 1 FIGURE 4 is a crosssection taken along line 4 4 inFIGURE 2 FIGURE 5 is a front elevational view of the preferred exemplary embodiment of the apparatus constructed according to the present invention FIGURE 6 is an elevational rearview of the preferred embodiment shown in FIGURE 5 with parts having been removed for clarity FIGURE 7 is a side elevational view of the preferred embodiment as shown in FIGURES 5 and 6 with portions having been cut away for clarity FIGURE 8 is an enlarged plan view of the deck and transfer carriage assemblies FIGURE 9 is an enlarged front elevational view of the welding head with portions having been omitted or cut away for clarity FIGURE 9a is a top plan view of the preferred embodiment of the device shown in FIGURE 5 with parts having been deleted for clarity FIGURE 10 is a diagrammatic view of the heating and clamping assemblies FIGURE 11 is an enlarged side elevational view of one of the heating and clamping assemblies FIGURE 12a is an enlarged front elevational view of the long heating and clamping assemblies FIGURE 12b is an enlarged front elevational view of the short heating and clamping assemblies FIGURE 13 is a partial detailed elevational view of the operative end of the cover pickup mechanism FIGURE 14 is a series of diagrammatic figures showing the operational sequence of the present invention FIGURE 15 shows a portion of the control circuit used to control the sequential operation of the present invention FIGURE 16 shows the input board connections used in the control system FIGURE 17 shows the output board connections used in the control system FIGURE 18 is an enlarged diagrammatic view similar toFIGURE 14e showing the bead formation during heating and FIGURE 19 is an enlarged diagrammatic view showing the resulting homogeneous weld structure following the welding process.

Turning first to FIGURE 1, a cover according to the present invention is generally indicated at 10 and is comprised of a main plate member 12. As shown in FIGURES 3 and 4, plate member 12 is provided with a depending rim portion, generally indicated at 14, although plate member 12 could be a substantially flat plane whose peripheral edge portion was located in the same plane as defined by the top and bottom surfaces of plate member 12. The cover 10 is provided with a centrally positioned vent hole, indicated at 16, which is provided with projections 18 which will mate with similar projections on a vent cap so that hole 16 can be closed. Hole 16 provides the vent opening for the battery end, and as indicated hereinafter, also provides the means by which the cover can be locked into engagement withthe welding head or heating and clamping assemblies. Cover 10 is also provided with additional openings indicated in phantom lines at 20, so that terminal posts from the electrodes within the battery jar will be able to extend up through cover 10 wherein place on the battery jar. The bottom of cover 10 is shown in FIGURE 2 where support ribs 22 and 24 respectively support the cover and depending portions 26 and 28 tha extend from beneath vent hole 16 and provide stiffening for the vent area. In addition, depending portions 26 and 28 are separated by gaps, generally indicated at 30 and 32, which provides vent passages for gases which may accumulate within the battery during use. Depending downwardly from the bottom surface of cover 10 and extending about the periphery thereof is an alignment mechanism, generally indicated at 34, which is comprised of a plum ality of guide posts, indicated at 36, as well as flange or skirt members 38 which extend between guide posts 36 so that together a continuous member is formed about the periphery of the bottom surface. Guide posts 36 are preferably spaced about one inch apart although the exact spacing therebetween is not critical, it only being important that they be spaced close enough together so as to straighten the upper edge or rim of the battery jar as they are inserted when cover 10 is placed on the battery jar so that the side walls of the battery jar adjacent the cover will not be rippled but rather will lie substantially flat. This helps to assure that the upper rim of the battery jar will lie directly beneath the outer periphery of cover 10 and adjacent the horizontal weld surface thereof.The length of the front surface of the guide posts 36 is approximately one half inch and their bottoms are tapered as, at 40, at approximately 30 degree although greater amounts of tapering can be employed with the tapered surface, serving as a guide so the cover can be easily inserted into the battery jar. The skirt or flange 38 has a front or exterior surface 42 which is provided with about a 1 degree taper whereas the rear surface 44 has about a 3 degree taper to facilitate de molding. It will be noted from FIGURES 2 4 that guide posts 36 extend outwardly from surface 42 of skirt 38 a predetermined distance which is indicated at A at FIGURE 3. Distance A will preferably range from about .015 inches to about .050 inches with a preferred spacing of about .030 to about .040 inches. Thus, when the outer portion of guide posts 36 is in contact with the interior sidewall 114 of a battery jar, as shown in the various views inFIGURE 7, a gap equal to distance A will be formed between surface 42 and surface 114. In addition, the outer edge of cover 19 is spaced from the outer surface of guide posts 36 by a distance B, as shown inFIGURE 3, which is equal to the thickness of the jar sidewall, normally about .100 inches .003 with distance C, the distance between the outer edge of cover 10 and surface 42, being a combination of distances A and B. While guide posts 36 have been shown as cylindrical members it should be understood that square, oblong or crosssectional shapes could also be used and would perform equally as well since it is only important to obtain the gap between surface 42 and the outer surface of guide post 36. It should also be pointed out that the portion of the bottom surface of cover 10 lying between skirt 38, guide posts 36 and the outer edge of cover 10 defines the horizontal welded surface, indicated at 46, that will mate with and be welded to the upper surface of the battery jar, indicated at 116 inFIGURE 7.Further, the upper portion of guide posts 36 and at least certain portions of surface 42 will form a second weld area as these will become, at least in part, welded to portions of the interior surface 114 of the battery jar so that together they will form a second or vertical weld surface area. As shown in the cross sectional view of FIGURE 4, the skirt thickness is approximately half that of guide posts 36 but it should be understood that the thickness of skirt 38 could be enlarged with any enlargement occurring in an inward direction so that the gap between surface 42 and the outer surface of guide posts 36 would be maintained. As indicated previously, it was found in the types of battery covers which employed solid continuous flanges which extend around the periphery of the cover that while such a structure exhibited very good shear resistance strength following bonding, welding only occurred between the horizontal surface of the cover and the top surface of the battery jar rim and did not extend vertically along the face of the flange. We believe this is because of the hydraulic flow characteristics and viscosity of the molten plastic which, as such covers where bought back down onto the jar, would be extruded outwardly away from the flange toward the outside of the joint. Thus, the flange itself acted as a dam preventing any inward flow which made the joint only as thick as the sidewall and accord ingly produced a joint that was weaker in tensile strength than the sidewall. In the cover described herein, guide posts 36 perform the same functon as the solid flange of the above described cover, but without the attendant problems. Guide posts 36, whether used with or without skirt 38, provide means for aligning the battery jar sidewalls with the molded cover and also serve to maintain that aligned relationship during welding so that the cover and jar remain in engagement throughout welding. Further, by employing the spaced apart guide posts, an area is provided interiorly along the joint allowing that thermoplastic material to be extruded outwardly and inwardly as well. In order to obtain an even stronger joint, we found that by including skirt portions 38 between guide posts 36 but recessed therefrom a predetermined distance, not only was a gap provided which still allowed the thermoplastic material to flow in a vertically downward direction, but a stronger joint was obtained because during heating a portion of guide posts 36 could be melted, surface 42 could be softened and together with the jarrs interior wall became a vertically welded area. Thus, a longer joint was produced that exhibited, in total, more tensile strength than the side wall of the battery the joint structure was more stable than the battery jar itself. However, it should be understood that skirt portions 38 do not have to extend continuously between guide posts 36.Thus, discontinuous skirt portions could be used therebetween as shown in phantom at 48 in FIGURE 3. Turning now to the method and apparatus for joining the cover to the jar, the overall machine is best shown in FIGURES 5, 6 and 7 and turning to those figures the machine is generally indicated at 100 and is comprised of a number of main assemblies including a main frame assembly 102, a deck assembly 114 a transfer carriage assembly 116, a welding head assembly 118, a hydraulic supply 120, a primary hydraulic manifold 122, a secondary hydraulic manifold and a pneumatic manifold 124. The frame can be considered as being comprised of front and rear portions, the rear portion being formed from frame elements 126 which form a rectangular base for supporting the hydraulic supply 120. The front frame is comprised of a base portion including side members 128, a rear member 130 and a front member 132. The rear frame is secured to the rear member 130 of the front frame by any convenient means such as by bolted brackets as shown in FIGURE 8 at 133. The front frame also includes a vertical frame member, generally indicated at 134, comprised of a bottom member 136, two side members, 138 and 140, and a top member 142 which together form another rectangular element that can also be bolted to the rear base member 130 and supported by braces 144 and 146 which extend from the upper portion of the vertical frame member 134, respect tively, to the rear corners of the side base members 128, as shown inFIGURES 6 and 7, and by a second pair of braces, 148 and 150, which extend from the upper portion of frame member 134 back to frame elements 126 on either side of hydraulic supply 120. Braces 144 150 can be secured between the frame elements in any convenient fashion such as by the use of clevis type mounting brackets as are indicated at 152 throughout the various views. The deck and transfer carriage assemblies 114 and 116, respectively, are located at the base of the machine and are supported by base members 128, 130 and 132 and extend across the area beneath the welding head assembly 118. The deck assembly 114 is comprised of a plate member 160 secured to base members 128 132 by any convenient means such as screws 162. Plate member 160 extends across the entire width of the deck assembly 114 and preferably extends from beneath the transfer carriage assembly 116 to the front edge of front base member 132. Plate 160 is provided with three openings 164, 166 and 168 through which roller actuated limit or microswitches 170, 172 and 174 can extend. These limit switches respectively define loading, welding and unloading stations and are aligned with each other along the path of travel of the carriage assembly 116 as will be more fully understood hereafter.Deck assembly 114 also includes a front guide, generally indicated at 176, which is mounted to frame member 132 by means of end plates 178 and 180 which are each attached to frame member 132 by means of brackets and screws as shown in FIGURE 8 at 181. Pivotally secured to end plates 178 and 180 are two mounting bars 182 and 184 which together support a pivotal guide bar 186 by means of mounting brackets 188 and 190. End plates 178 and 180 are each provided with slots 192, as shown in FIGURE 7, that curve rearwardly away from the top portion of the end plates for about a 90 degree arc. A securing shaft 194 extends through these slots and is provided with threaded ends.As shown in FIGURE 8 a nut 196 is secured to the end extending through end plate 178 while an adjusting handle 198 is threadedly secured to the end of shaft 194 extending through end plate 180. A sleeve 200 overlies shaft 194 in the area between end plates 178 and 180 and also between mounting bars in the area between end plates 182 and 184 so that as handle 198 is turned, mounting bars 182 and 184 will be squeezed and held in position between the ends of sleeve 200 and end plates 178 and 180. When handle 198 is loosened mounting bars 182 and 184 can be adjusted within slots 192 to correctly position guide plate 186 with respect to the front side of battery jars being processed after which the handle can then be turned to lock the position of mounting bars i82 and 184 as adjusted. It is important that the front face of guide plate 186 be kept perpendicular to plate 160 so that it will lay flat against the sidewalls of battery jars passing thereby. In order to accomplish that, a pair of adjusting levers 202, as shown in FIGURE 7, extend from a point directly beneath each of the mounting bars 182 and 184 adjacent the point at which those mounting bars are attached to end plates 178 and 180. The other end of adjusting levers 202 are connected to brackets 188 and 190 adjacent guide plate 186. Thus, as mounting bars 182 and 184 are moved levers 202 cause guide plate 186 to pivot thereby maintaining the perpendicular alignment of the front face of guide bar 186. With consideration still being given to FIGURES 5 8 the transfer carriage assembly 116 is mounted to frame members 128 by mounting brackets 210 and 212 which respectively support two horizontally extending and vertically spaced apart guide rails 214 and 216 through a pair of brackets 218 for the top rail 214 and a second pair of brackets 220 for the bottom rail 216. Two pairs of linear bearings or pillow blocks 222 and 224 respectively secured to mounting plate 226 slidably support plate 226 to the upper and lower guide shafts 214 and 216. Secured to the front face of mounting plate 226 is an upper guide channel member 228 and lower guide channel member 230 which perhaps are best shown in FIGURES 5 and 8. These are secured to mounting plate 226 by means handles 232 which have threaded bolts extending therefrom for engaging nuts 234 on the rear side of mounting plate 226.In order to allow channel members 228 and 230 to be adjusted horizontally a pair of slots 236 are provided in the mounting plate 226 for top channel member 228 and a second pair of slots 238 are provided in mounting plate 226 for the lower channel member 230. It is through those slots that threaded bolts from handles 232 extend to engage nuts 234. Thus, in order to move channel members 228 and 230 horizontally it is only necessary to loosen handles 232, make the required adjustments and then tighten handle 232 again thereby fixing the channel members in a desired location. With reference first to the upper channel member 228, the transfer arms 240 and 242 are pivotally attached within channel 228 so they can fold into channel 228 as shown by the arrows inFIGURE 8. Arm 240 is actuated by means of a pneumatic cylinder, shown in phantom at 244, which acts on a linkage structure 246 pivotally connected to arm 240. We prefer to have arms 240 and 242 linked together and rather than employing two drive cylinders a linkage arm 248 is connected from linkage structure 246 across the top of channel bar 228 to alike linkage structure 250 secured to bar 242. A pair of slots 249 are provided in the top of channel member 228 and a suitable pivotal pin connection can serve to connect linkage arm 248 to the linkage structures 246 and 250 of arms 240 and 242, respectively.When cylinder 244 is actuated both bars 240 and 242 are moved simultaneously within the confines of channel member 228. A limit switch 252 is secured within channel member 228 so that it is tripped when arm 140 is in its closed position thereby providing an input signal indicating to the control system, described hereinafter, that arms 240 and 242 are in a closed position. Turning now to the lower channel member 230 a fixed arm 254 is secured thereto by any convenient means and serves to support guide plate 256 which is adjustable within arm 254 by means of a handle and nut assembly 258 siilar to those used to mount a channel members 228 and 230. In addition, a slot is provided in arm 254 to allow guide plate 256 to be moved back and forth therein, again in order to accommodate varying sizes of battery jars. When guide plate 256 is in place, as shown in FIGURE 7, a battery jar, shown in phantom in FIGURE 7, will be held between guide plate 256 and front guide plate 186. A movable arm 262 is pivotally secured to channel member 230 in a fashion similar to that used for arms 240 and 242 with the movement thereof be in control by a second pneumatic cylinder 264, as shown in FIGURE 5, through a suitable linkage structure 266 so that it is moved in a direction opposite to that of arms 240 and 242 as indicated in FIGURE 8. A limit switch 268 is secured to channel 230 so that it will be actuated when arm 262 is closed. When limit switches 268 and 252 are both actuated that will fulfill one of the conditions necessary prior to the controller allowing transfer carriage assembly to move back to the starting position which is shown in FIGURE 8. It should be understood that arm 262 is positioned between arms 240 and 242 so that when channel members 228 and 230 are properly adjusted one battery jar will be held between fixed arm 254 and arm 240 while another will be held between arms 262 and 242. Also, during the initial phases of the welding cycle we prefer to leave arms 240 and 254 around the jar that has been moved from the load station to the weld station. Movement of the carriage transfer assembly is provided by hydraulic cylinder 270 which can be similar to a Parker HannifinCat. No. PAS 22 inch stroke hydraulic cylinder manufactured by theParker Hannifin Corp., Des Plaines, Illinois. Cylinder 270 is mounted to bracket 210 and an internal mounting bracket 272 by means of its own mounting brackets 274 and 276, respectively.Drive cylinder 270 is provided with a drive rod 278 connected through coupling 280 to bracket 282 fixed to the rear of plate 226 by any convenient means such as bolts or screws not shown . As shown in FIGURES 6 and 8, two limit switches 284 and 286 are provided to respectively indicate when drive rod 278 is in its retracted and extended positions thereby providing inputs to the control system indicating when the transfer assembly is at its load station, as shown in FIGURE 8, or in its full stroke position at which time arms 254 and 240 will occupy the position shown for arms 262 and 242 in FIGURE 4 whereas arms 262 and 242 become moved so as to over lie limit switch 168 at the unload station. Thus, with one jar in the load station above limit switch 170 and a second jar at the weld station, between arms 242 and 262, actuation of cylinder 270 will move the jars, respectively, from the load to the weld station and from the weld station to the unload station. Overall view of the welding head assembly 118 are shown in FIGURES 5 7 and 9 while additional details of the welding head structure are shown in the FIGURES 10 13. Turning first toFIGURES 5 and 7, two vertically mounted guide shafts 300 and 302 are respectively secured to frame members 140 and 138. Welding head assembly 118 is slideably secured to guide shafts 300 and 302 by means of linear bearings or pillow blocks 304 which are in turn directly secured to the welding head assembly 118. In particular, pillow blocks 304 are secured to a welding head frame structure, generally indicated at 306, comprised of two vertical mfflntrs 2û8 and 310 between which a support plate 312 and a tie bar 314 extend.Elements 308 314 comprise the rear vertical section of the welding head frame structure and pillow blocks 304 are connected to vertical members 308 and 310. A main horizontal mounting plate 316 is attached along its rear edge to members 308 and 310 and bar 314 with its front and immediate portions being supported by a network of frame members, generally indicated at 318, and including elements 318a 318. Prior to describing the remaining structure of welding head assembly 118 it is important to understand how the welding assembly is supported and moved. The primary support for the welding head assembly 118 and the main up down adjusting mechanism is provided by a hydraulic actuated jack screw 320 which is a mechanical jack manufactured by the Duff Norton Company, Charlotte, N.C. Model 1802. This jack provides the gross adjustment for the weld head and will be adjusted according to the height of the jars to be processed.It is driven by means of a hydraulic motor 322 such as the Char LynnCat. No. 11 832 mfg. by Eaton Corp. Eden Prairie, Minn Motor 322 is connected to jack 320 by its drive shaft 324 through suitable couplings 326 and 328 is supported to vertical frame member 140 by a mounting bracket 330. Accordingly, it together with the base portion of jack 320 remain fixed in position. Jack screw 332 is operatively connected to a first or lower support plate 334 by means of a mounting bracket 336. Connected to the opposite side of the first or lower support plate 334 and directly opposite jack screw 332 is a hydraulic cylinder 338 whose drive rod 340 is attached by means a clevis type mounting bracket 342 to second or intermediate mounting plate 344.We have found it preferable to have the stroke of hydraulic cylinder 338 be approximately 4 inches in order to provide sufficient clearance for all forms of terminal posts so that battiers being moved by the carriage assembly 116 across deck plate 160 pass freely beneath welding head assembly 118. Thus, jack screw 320 places the welding head assembly 118 in its exact operating position and the 4 inch stroke of cylinder 338 provides sufficient clearance to raise the welding head assembly 118 out of the path of jars being moved across the deck. As is clear from FIGURE 6, three additional cylinders are mounted to the top side of mounting plate 344 and these cylinders are respectively shown at 346, 348 and 350. The central cylinder 348 provides the primary drive force for moving the welding head assembly 118 during the heating and welding cycle, as will be more fully described hereinafter, and it is secured to an upper mounting plate 352 through its drive shaft 354. Mounting plate 352 is secured to the welding head frame 306, as shown in FIGURE 7, by being secured to vertical frame members 308 and 310 by any convenient means such as by welding or bolts not shown . Thus, when cylinder 348 is actuated the entire welding head assembly 118 will move vertically up and down.In order to correctly position the welding head assembly 118 as it is moved up and down during both the heating and welding phases of the operating cycle, heat stops and weld stops are provided. The heat stops control the down position of the weld head assembly 118 during heating and are comprised of hydraulic cylinders 346 and 350 and specifically by their drive shafts which contact opposing adjustable studs 356 and 258 which can have a variable length and can be adjusted within mounting plate 352. The up stop for controlling how high assembly 118 is raised and the weld stops are provided by threaded shafts 360 and 362 which are each provided with pairs of lock nuts in positioned on opposite sides of mounting plate 352.These opposing lock nuts provide positive control over the raised position and also over the lowered position of welding head assembly 118 in those instances when hydraulic cylinder 346 and 350 are deactuated and their drive shafts are retracted. It should also be pointed out that in order to insure the smooth raising and lowering of the weld head assembly 118 by cylinder 338, two guide shafts 364 and 366 are secured to the base of the intermediary mounting plate 344 and extend downwardly through mounting plate 334 within bearings provided in openings in that plate. As shown in FIGURE 6, limit switches 368 and 370 are provided to respectively produce input signals to the control means to indicate the retracted and fully extended conditions of drive rod 340 of cylinder 338. Limit switch 368 is secured to a bracket 372 secured to plate 334 and will abut the bottom of intermediate plate 344 when drive rod 340 is fully retracted. Limit switch 370 is secured to the side of plate of 334 and its actuating arm rides against shaft 342 and will move inwardly when drive rod 340 is fully extended and shaft 342 has been raised about flush with the bottom of plate 334. Two additional limit switches 374 and 376 are provided to indicate the two extreme positions for jack screw 332 of the jack 320 with both being actuated by the plate 334. Limit switch 376 indicates when the jack screw 332 is fully retracted and will prevent further lowering of the weld head assembly 118 whereas limit switch 374 indicates the highest safe position for the jack screw 332 that can be tolerated without having the jack screw becoming disengaged from jack 320. Turning now to FIGURES 5, 7 and 9 and it can be seen that the operating portion of the welding head assembly 118 is comprised generally of an upper actuating cylinder assembly, generally indicated at 390 which is supported by a top plate 392 an intermediate section containing control shaft mechanisms, generally indicated at 394, located between the top plate 392 and the main horizontal mounting plate 316 and movable, separate heating and clamping assemblies, generally indicated at 396. The upper actuating cylinder assembly 390 is comprised of nine cylinders which includes an outer group of four pneumatic cylinders 398, 400, 402 and 404, an inner group of four pneumatic cylinders 406, 408, 410 and 412 and a centrally located hydraulic cylinder 414. As is indicated in FIGURE 9, each of these cylinders can be secured to top plate 392 by mounting brackets and bolts, generally indicated at 416. Each of the pneumatic cylinders 398 412 have a spring return and are actuated by valves controlled by solenoids and when so actuated will cause their respective drive rods to be extended through a predetermined stroke. As shown in phantom in FIGURE 9, the stroke of cylinders 348 404 can be controlled by stop rods 380 if the stroke of the cylinder is otherwise too long. Considering first the outer group of four pneumatic cylinders 398 404, the drive rod of each is connected to a control coupling member 418 and serve to control clamp members, generally indicated at 420, by means of a solid drive cable assembly generally indicated at 422. This drive cable assembly includes a pair drive shafts 424a and 424b, upper and lower cable connectors 426 and 428, respectively, and outer guide sleeves 430. Intermediate plate 431 is supported from the upper plate 392 by four short mounting posts 432 whereas four long mounting posts 434 extend between intermediate plate 431 and the main horizontal mounting plate 316. Thus, plate 431 serves as a terminal point for all of the connectors 426 from each of the control cables. The lower end of sleeves 430 and specifically lower cable connectors 338 are mounted to the heater and clamp assemblies 396 so that each of the control shafts can correctly actuate specific portions of teh heater and clamp assemblies 386. With respect to cylinder 398 and the clamp assembly, generally indicated at 420, the lower end of shaft 424 is connected clevis 436 which is pivotally connected to clamp member 320. The inner group of pneumatic cylinders 406 412 have each of their respective drive rods extending through a control coupling 440 and connected directly to a control shaft 442 which again extends through coupling members similar to those indicated at 426 and 428 and through a sleeve 443 directly to heater assemblies, generally indicated at 444, via a clevis type coupling number 446. Pneumatic cylinder 414 has its drive rod not shown connected to a coupling plate 450 which joins together eight control shafts 452. The eight drive shafts 452 are divided into four pairs with each pair going to one of the heater clamp assemblies 396 to control the vertical up and down motion that will subsequently be applied to the heater assemblies 444. It should be kept in mind that the arrangement and mounting of the clamp and heating assemblies 420 and 444, respectively, is designed so that clamp assembly 420 can be pivoted inwardly toward the. battery jar and outwardly away therefrom while the heater assemblies 444 cannot only be pivoted toward and away from the battery jars but moved a slight amount in an up and down direction independent of the welding head as well as the clamp assemblies 420.It is this up and down travel of the heater members 444 that is controlled by hydraulic cylinder 414 and shafts 452. As was the case with the control shafts for the pneumatic cylinders 398 412, control shafts 452 are passed through upper and lower coupling members similar to those indicated at 426 and 428 and their own respective sleeves 454 which are similar to those indicated at 430 and 443. The lower end of shafts 452 are connected through a stop plate 456 to a clevis member 458. It should also be pointed out that clevis member 458 operates with bracket 460 against which stop member 456 abuts so that together stop member 456 and bracket 460 provide down stop control which limits the extent to which heater assembly 444 can be lowered. With emphasis still being placed primarily on FIGURE 9 reference can also be made to FIGURES 10 12 where more of the details of the clamp assemblies 420 and the heating assemblies 444 are shown. As is diagrammatically shown in FIGURE 10 four heating and clamping assemblies 396 are used and are indicated atA, B, C, and D respectively, they are positioned in opposing pairs.Assemblies C and D are short and have a length comparable to the relatively constant width of battery jars which are in a narrow series of either 6.19 or 6.25 inches or a wider series of 8.625 inches. Since the length of batteries can vary anywhere from about 2 inches to about 12 or 14 inches, assemblies A and B are longer and are positioned outside assemblies C and D. Accordingly, assembliesA and B should have lengths equal to or greater than the longest length that will be handled and we have found that a length of 13 to 14 inches should be sufficient for most purposes.Each of the heating and clamping assemblies is, apart from the length differences, constructed substantially identically and an end view of a representative one is shown in FIGURE 11 whereas a side elevational view of the longer units a and b as shown in FIGURE 12a whereas a representative side elevational view of the shorter units c and d is shown in FIGURE 12b. Also, for clarify some elements have been omitted, cut away or included in phantom in these figures. In addition, the reference numerals used in FIGURE 12b which relate to common parts which have simply been reduced in size include the letter a . Each of the heating and clamping assemblies are mounted to an Shaped structure generally indicated at 470 comprised of a top horizontal plate 472 and a vertical plate 474. Plate 472 can be welded or screwed directly to vertical plate 474 or alternatively a triangular shaped end piece, indicated at 476, could be used to complete the Shaped structure 470. As shown in FIGURE 11, bracket 460 is secured to vertical plate 474 by screws 478 and likewise, screws 480 can be used to secre two spaced apart end plates 482 to vertical plate 474. End plates 482, as shown inFIGURE 12a, for example, are positioned at spaced apart locations and serve to support shaft 484 which is held in place by set screws 485. Clamping assembly 420 and heating assembly 444 are both pivotally attached to shaft 484 as follows. Clamping assembly 420 is comprised of a clamp bar 486 secured to two bell cranks 488 and 490 by screws 492 and bar mounts 493. The inner end of the top horizontal portion of the bell crank is provided with an opening that fits about shaft 484 and a collar, respectively indicated at 494 and 496, is welded to each crank arm adjacent the openings and these are also pivotally retained on shaft 484. The outer end of the top horizontal section of each bell crank, 488 and 490, is pivotally secured through pins 498 to clevis members 436 which are connected to control shafts 424 and the outer cylinders 398 404. Shaft 484 also supports a one piece crank arm 500 which supports the heater assembly 444. Crank arm 500 is comprised of a sleveve 502 from which a horizontal member 504 extends rearwardly away from plate 474 and is connected by pin 506 to clevis 446 so that the heater assemblies 444 can be pivotally controlled by control shafts 442. As shown in FIGURE 9, on the right side where the clamp assembly 420 has been omitted, and in FIGURES 12a and b, an arm 505 and 507 depends from each end of sleeve 502 and each has an opening that fits about shaft 484. Bearing sleeves 508 and 510 are welded or otherwise secured to the inside surface of arms 505 and 507 and each is provided with internal bearings 512.Shafts 514 and 516 are slidably retained within bearing sleeves 508 and 510, respectively, and each is respectively connected to a separate clevis member 458 by pins 515, which are in turn connected to control shafts 452. Connected to the bottom of each of the shafts 514 and 516 is an up stop collar 518 and a heating bar, generally indicated at 520, is connected to the end of shafts 514 and 516 by screws 522. Accordingly, the heating bar 520 can be raised and lowered vertically by the action of shafts 452 as controlled by cylinder 414 with the limitation over its travel in the vertical direction being provided in an upward direction by collars 518 which abut against the bottom of bearing sleeves 508 and 510 and in a downward direction by stop plates 456 which abut against brackets 460. Heating bar 520 is comprised of an outer housing 524 in which a heater block 526 is retained by bolts 528. A 600 watt 240 volt 5 8 inch Watlow heater, Model Number G5J36, indicated at 530, is retained within block 526 and serves to heat a heating blade 532 fixed to the bottom of block 526 by screws 534. A layer of insulation 536 is provided on each side of block 526 in order to space that block from housing 524 and as can be seen from FIGURE 11 heating blade 532 extends inwardly further than the inner face of clamp bar 586. While the up and down stops control the vertical motion of heating assembly 444, the pivotal motion is controlled by an in stop control in the form of a threaded bolt 538 secured in a mounting bracket 540 connected to arms 504 and 507. Returning again to FIGURE 11 the vertical plate 474 is provided along its lower edge with a rail member 550 which applies pressure to the joint area between the battery cover and jar and is also used to secure the cover to the weld head assembly 118. As indicated with respect to the diagrammatic showing in FIGURE 10, each of the heating and clamping assemblies 396 is slidably secured to mounting plate 316 and is movable toward and away from the center thereof. In order to effect that type of mounting a guide member 552, as shown in FIGURE 11, is secured by welding or other convenient means to the top of horizontal plate member 472 and a threaded stud 554 extends upwardly away from guide member 552 and is used with handles 556 to lock each of the assemblies 396 in a fixed position. The horizontal mounting plate 316 is provided with a plurality of slots for each of the four heating and clamping assemblies, these slots being identified generally at 560, 562, 564 and 566 and it is within those pairs of slots that each of the guide members 552 can slide.It should be noted that the long assemblies 396 each have two guide members 552 while the short assemblies have one. The remaining sots in plate 316 are provided to allow the control shaft couplings to move as the assemblies 396 are moved. In order to adjust the four heating and clamping assemblies 396 for a particular size battery jar and cover combination, the width of the jar in a given series will be a constant factor and equal to the length of members C and D in FIGURE 10. The length, however, can change, depending on the number of plates or elements being used, and members C and D would first be set like distances away from the center of plate 316 and locked in place with the distance between them being equal to the length of the series of jars to be processed. Next, the heating and clamping members A and B in FIGURE 10 would be moved so that they are in a position directly adjacent the opposite ends of heating and clamping members C and D.Thus, when a jar was properly positioned between members A, B, C and D the clamping bars in each of these members would clamp all four sidewalls and the heating bars 532 in each of the assemblies would be able to contact the entire periphery between the cover and the jar. It is important to keep in mind, in this regard, that assemblies A, B, C, and D are positioned so that when the heating assemblies are in their closed position the heating bars 536 in assemblies A and B will touch and engage the heating bars of C and D so that when in position during heating the entire periphery of the cover and jar being processed will be heated and melted to the appropriate degree. Turning now to FIGURES 7 and 13, a cover pick up assembly, generally indicated at 568, is shown and is driven by a pneumatic cylinder 570 located at the center of plate 316 wher it is held in place by means of a threaded ring and sleeve not shown to accommodate various vent heights in covers. This cylinder is used to assure firm contact between the cover and rail members 550.The lower portion of this cover pick up assembly 468 is dimensioned so that it can fit through a centrally located vent opening in battery covers. Cylinder 570 is provided with a drive arm 572 that is connected to a head member 576 by a connecting shaft 583. Head member 576 is also provided with an inverted cone shaped surface 577. This drive unit is slidably held within a split sleeve member, generally indicated at 574, which is comprised of a plurality of resilient arms 578 each of which terminates at a head member 580 which has a portion that extends outwardly beyond arms 578 so as to define a ledge or seat 582. To facilitate an easy release of the cover and removal of the resilient arms 478 from the cover vent hole a withdrawal guide sleeve 584 is provided within cylinder 570 which extends downwardly to a point just above seats 582. Sleever 584 has an outer diameter substantially the same as the outer periphery of seats 582 when in their retracted, normal, position so that upon release of the cover, head members 580 will not extend outwardly beyond sleeve 484 and will not, therefore, catch on the cover. Also, guide sleeve 584 and the split sleeve member 574 are secured together so that they can slide together within an outer support sleeve 581 that is secured to cylinder 570. The upper portion of split sleeve member 574 is formed with a cup shaped seat portion 579 and a spring 585 fits between seat portion 579 and a support surface 586 internally provided at the end of cylinder 70. Spring 585 prevents split sleeve member 574 from being withdrawn into cylinder 570 as drive arm 581 is retracted. After the depending portion of the drive rod 572 and the split sleeve member 575 are extended downwardly into the vent hole of the cover and the drive rod is pulled back into the cylinder which causes a cone shpaed surface 577 on head member 576 to move against head members 580. Because of the presence of the split resilient arms 578 head members 580 are urged outwardly beyond guide sleeve 584 as well as the periphery of the vent opening, beneath the surface of the cover. As the force of spring 585 is overcome following the expansion of resilient arms 578, further retraction of drive arm 472 moves seats 582 upwardly so that the cover will likewise be raised upwardly toward and into contact with rail members 550. At that point the cover will be locked to the welding head assembly 118 and will move as the weld head assembly 118 is moved. A support lug 587 extends through the sidewall of sleeve 581 and serves to retain the split sleeve member 574 at a predetermined lower position and prevents member 575 from falling out of its position within sleeve 581. Turning now to FIGURES 14a h the progression of steps that occur during the heating and welding cycles are shown. The beads resulting from these processing steps have been omitted for the sake of clarity. FIGURE 14a represents the status of the cover and battery jar after they have been moved from the load station to the welding station as the welding head assembly 118 is being lowered into position. Clamp bars 486 have already been brought to bear against the side walls of the battery jar and rails 550 are descending toward engagement with the outer periphery of the cover. Guides are provided on the battery cover that engage the interior wall of the battery jar and the pressing action of guide bars 486 assures that opposing side walls of the battery jar are parallel and that adjacent walls are perpendicular so that a proper fit is assured between the cover and the jar side walls. In FIGURE 14b rails 550 are in contact with the outer periphery of the cover and it is at this point where the cover pick up cylinder 570 will be actuated by the control system, described hereinafter, in order to assure the fixed relationship of the cover between that c ylinder and rails 550. Turning next to FIGURE 14c cylinder 348 has caused the entire welding head 118 to be moved upwardly but it should be noted that the entire cover and particularly the guides that depend therefrom are not removed from their contact with the side wall of the battery jar. This is important because we have found it to be quite helpful to have the parts which are melted brought back together as quickly and as accurately as possible. By not removing the cover structure from the jar, the initial alignment established between the cover and the battery jar, which is aided by the presence of clamp bars 486, is not lost at any time during the heating and welding procedures. The heating blades 532 have been pivoted into position between clamp bars 486 and rails 550 and also in between the top of the battery jar and the bottom of the outer periphery of the cover.The pivoting action of the heater blade 532 has been effected of the inner group of cylinders, they are cylinders 406 412. We have found that it is desirable to separately move the long and short heating bars and this allows the short bars to be pivoted ahead of the long ones when pivoted into position and after the long ones when pivoted out of position. This prevents any possible scraping between the opposed pairs as they are moved. It is sometimes important to have the heating blade 532 to contact either the cover or the battery jar for a longer length of time, depending upon the type of plastic used, and in FIGURE 14d the heating blade 532 is shown as having been moved upwardly so that it engages the bottom surface of the cover. This upward movement has been effected by pneumatic cylinder 414 and the upward limitation on the movement of the blade 532 is effected by the sup stop or collars 518. Thereafter, turning to FIGURE 14e the entire welding head can be lowered to the heat stop position defined by heat stop cylinders 346 and 350. In this position, the heating blade 532 is in contact with both the cover and the battery jar and that position can be maintained for a predetermined dwell time as is necessary to effect the required degree of melting to produce an adequate weld.This is controlled by an adjustable timer T1. After the conclusion of that dwell period, the weld head assembly 118 is again raised by cylinder 348. This disengages the heating blades 532 from the battery jar but as will be recalled from reference to FIGURE 14d the heating blade had been raised to an up position so that it engaged the cover. We have found that it is not desirable to merely pivot the heating blade away from melted surfaces but rather that such disengagement should occur in a vertical direction. Therefore, the heating blades 532 are caused to be lowered again away from the cover in a motion reverse to that used in FIGURE 14d to bring them into engagement with that cover with the heater blades now being moved downwardly again by cylinder 414. This downward movement can occur simultaneously with the raising of the welding head assembly 118.In this instance, stop plate 456 limits the downward travel of heating blades 532 allowing them to become disengaged from the cover but not to move down so as to re engage the top surface of the battery jar. This intermediate position for the heating blades 532 is shown in FIGURE 14f. Thereafter, the heating blades can be pivoted out of the way and the welding head can again be lowered by the action of cylinder 348 this time to the position of the weld stops defined by rods 360 and 362 and the adjusting nuts thereon. The welding position is shown in FIGURE 14g and clearly shows the cover in contact with the side wall of the battery jar. The relationship between pick up cover cylinder 570 and rails 550 still remains and accordingly weight from the welding head assembly 118 can be brought to bear against the joint through rails 550.If the weight of the welding head is too great some amount of positive pressure can be applied by cylinder 348 so as to assure the correct amount of weight during the welding portion of the cycle. We have found that about 300 pounds 100 pounds is all that is needed in terms of weight to be applied to rails 550 to effect a proper and high quality seam between the cover and the battery jar. In FIGURE 14h the dwell time for the welding cycle controlled by another adjustable timer T2 has passed, the cover pick up cylinder 370 has released its grip on the cover and the welding head is being raised away from the now completed weld area by cylinder 338. At the top of the stroke of this cylinder the welding head 118 will be in position to allow the carriage assembly 116 to move another battery jar from the load to the weld station and to remove the finished jar from the weld to the unload station. As indicated concerning FIGURE 14d there may be instances where it is desirable to have the heater blade 532 contact the cover and the jar for the same amount of time or for that matter to have the heater contact the top of the jar for a longer period. If it is desired to heat the cover and jar surfaces for approximately equal periods of time the heater assembly 544 can be allowed to float following its inward pivoting by cylinders 398 404 so that rather than being either raised or lowered it could be moved downward along with the welding head assembly 118 so that it comes into contact with both the cover and the jar at approximately the same time.Since the heater bars are at their lowest position relative to the cover when they are pivoted inwardly to the position as shown in FIGURE 14e the removal of drive pressure from cylinder 414 allows the welding head assembly 118 to correctly position the heater blades 532 as shown in FIGURE 14e. If it was desired to have the heating blade 532 contact the surface of the jar for a longer period of time following its being pivoted into the position shown in FIGURE 14c driving force from cylinder 414 can be left to maintain the lowest position for the heating blades 532 and thereafter the welding head can be lowered.In this instance, the heating blades will contact the jar prior to the full descending stroke of the weld head assembly 18 which will bring the cover into contact with the upper surface of the heating blades. In each of these operating modes the withdrawal sequence of the heating blades 532 is the same as that initially described. Further, as indicated previously it is most desirable to withdraw the heating blade from the thermoplastic surfaces in a vertical or perpendicular direction rather than having the heating blades slide either between the two now melted thermoplastic members prior to raising the cover away from the battery jar or across either melted surface in a horizontal fashion prior to moving the heating blade out of contact therewith. With respect to FIGURE 14g it should be understood that this position can be held by timer T2 for a period of time ranging from about 15 to about 25 seconds during which the weld area can cool down and set. This time period allows the thermoplastic material to resolidify at the joint and also provides time for the melted area to regain strength prior to being released. While beads form during the heating and welding steps have been omitted, it should be understood that beads will form on the outside of the joint between the cover and the jar and as an optional step, clamp bars 486 could be raised vertically off of the jar and cover assembly prior to their being pivoted out of contact therewith so as to spread the still soft beads into a flat layer. As will now be described, t h e operation of this apparatus is effected by both pneumatic and hydraulic systems. The pneumatic system is supplied with a source of compressed air not shown which is filtered through a filter and regulator assembly made by the Parker Company,Oswego, Michigan with the air being then supplied to the pneumatic manifold 124. This pneumatic manifold is actuated by solenoids under the control of a Model 5 Texas Instruments ProgrammableControl System which includes a programmer, sequencer, and input output boards which provide the necessary control logic interface between the operating solenoids of the pneumatic and hydraulic systems and the limit switches employed throughout the apparatus. The hydraulic supply 120 is supplied by the Pneumatic and Hydraulic Distributors, Inc. of Marlboro, Massachusetts 01752,Serial No. 71935 and includes a hydraulic reservoir 592 and a drive motor 594. This drive motor can be a three phase motor such asModel Number M80031 made by the Baldor Electric Company, FortSmith, Arkansas 72901. The hydraulic system also includes a radiator 596 so that the hydraulic fluid returning to the reservoir returns via the radiator and is cooled prior to being reused. Output from the reservoir flows to the hydraulic cylinders as regulated by a primary hydraulic manifold 122 and a second hydraulic manifold 123 both of which are actuated by solenoids under the control of the 5 TI control system.The primary hydraulic manifold 122 includes four directional control valves with one serving to control the up and down motion of the heating assemblies and specifically the actuation of cylinder 414, a second controls the melt stop cylinders 346 and 350, a third controls the primary short stroke cylinder 348 used during the heating and welding steps and a fourth controls the clearance cylinder 338. The secondary pneumatic manifold 123 serves to control the operation of motor 322 which drives jack 320 and also the main carriage drive cylinder 270. The pneumatic manifold 124 also includes a plurality of solenoid actuated valves which respectively control the cover pickup cylinder 570, the simultaneous actuation of carriage arm cylinders 244 and 264 the actuation of clamp cylinders 398 404 and two additional valves each controlling opposing pairs of the heater assemblies one controlling the long assemblies shown in FIGURE 12a and specifically cylinders 406 and 410 and another valve for controllng the short heater assemblies shown in FIGURE 12b specifically cylinders 408 and 412. As indicated previously, it is desirable to have the short heater assemblies actuated and pivoted into position first followed by the longer assemblies so that no sliding engagement occurs. The delay between the actuation of these two groups is only momentary but is sufficient to bring the short assemblies into position first. A number of limit switches have been already identified previously in the specification but additional limit switches are employed for each of the cylinders at the top of the welding head, namely 398 414, and the limit switches are respectively identified as 500616. These limit switches can be either actuated by the cylinders drive rods as those move or actuating arms can extend through the top mounting plate 392 so that they can contact, for example, couplings 418. In any event, it is only necessary that these limit switches be able to produce an input signal when the heating and clamping assemblies are pivoted out of their operating position. Turning now to FIGURES 15 18 the circuit diagrams of the control system for this invention are set forth. Turning first toFIGURE 15 we see the main control circuit, the main power supply and the temperature controllers for heater blades. In FIGURE 16 the input board for the controller is shown and in FIGURE 17 the output board from the controller. FIGURE 16 also includes the manual override circuit that allows manual operation of the devices. Turning now to FIGURE 15 lines 1, 2 and 3 are connected to a power supply of 240 volt, 3 phase 60 or any other suitable power Hertz power which is connected by means of a main power switch 620. Lines 1L1 1L3 each contain a 20 amp fuse and a transformer 622 is connected across lines lLl and 1L2 to provide the appropriate control voltage for the 5 TI controller and this portion of the circuit including the input and output boards. Three phase current is also supplied to the hydraulic supply motor 594. Control of that motor is provided by start switch 624 and stop switch 626.Start switch 624 is a momentary switch and actuates relay 628 which closes contacts 628a thereby providing a holding circuit around switch 624 to keep the motor running. Likewise, additional contacts 628b, c and d as well as an auxiliary contact 628e are also actuated with the latter serving as part of the switch controlling the master control relay 630. Master control relay 630 has a single contact 630a which will provide power to the input and output boards shown in FIGURES 16 and 17 once the motor is running and once the heaters have been turned on as will be explained hereafter. Overload protection for motor 594 is provided by overload switches and their contacts 632 which are in series with relay 628. When start switch 624 is actuated it also serves to turn on an amber light 634 and start an hour meter 636. The heaters are turned on in a similar fashion by a main on switch 638 thereby actuating a relay 640 which closes contacts 640a and 640b. Contacts 640a serves as a holding circuit around momentary switch 638 whereas contacts 640b complete the circuit to the master control relay 630 so that power is supplied to the input and output boards of the controller thru contact 630a. Switch 640a also serves to energize light 642 to indicate that the heaters are on. In addition, a heater stop switch 644 is also provided to turn the heaters off. The heater relay 640 additionally has contacts 640c, d and e which serve to connect lines 1L1 1L3 to the four temperature controllers indicated at 646, 648, 650 and 652. Thus, each of the heater bars 632 and the heating assemblies 444 has its temperature separately controllable and each of these temperature controllers 646 652 will be set for a specific temperature which will be controlled by the internal thermocouple indicated by contacts TC.In each of these temperature controllers terminals and LO are tied together so that power is supplied, for example, in temperature controller 646, via lines L3 and L2 with power coming in line via terminal LN and across the 600 watt heater 632 via terminal LO with the connection being completed back to line L3 via terminals L1 and 340 which corresponds to the 240 volt power supply. Control of this system can be automatic, via the controller or manual via the manual overrides. The input signals for the controller provided by the bottom half of the circuit shown inFIGURE 16 will be generated when the listed condition occurs as the switches are tripped closed. All of the switches are normally open except for those in positions X19 and X20 which signal the condition when the heater and clamp assemblies are pivoted outwardly away from contact with the jar and cover. These switches are normally closed switches. The outputs to control the solenoids and the respective pneumatic hydraulic manifolds are controlled according to the circuit set forth in FIGURE 17. The positions X0 X 15 are the input board in FIGURE 16 set forth manual override switches for manually operating the welding apparatus through its various cycles.Control between automatic sequencing and manual sequencing is provided by the mode selection switch 624. Turning first to the inputs on the lower portions ofFIGURE 16 the first position at X15 corresponds to the signal gen era ted at the end of the dwell time for heating which is provided by an adjustable timer T1 shown in FIGURE 17. At the next position X 16 is the output from time T2 which indicates the end of the welding time dwell period and this again is an adjustable time that can be varied to control the amount of time the apparatus is held in the position shown in FIGURE 14g. At the next positions X17 andX18, limit switches 286 and 284, respectively indicate, the position of the carriage assembly in its forward or back position and comparable outputs to cylinders 170 are provided by the solenoids at positions Ylll and Y12 on the output board shown in FIGURE 17. At the next position on the input board Xl 9 in FIGURE 16 there are four limit switches 602 608 which indicate the position of cylinders 398 404. As indicated previously, these switches are normally closed and when the cylinders 398 404 are actuated by an output from position Y1 on FIGURE 17 switches 602 608 will be open. When the clamps are again pivoted out of position, switches 602 608 will closed generating the input signal at X19 indicating the clamps have been infact pivoted away from the jar. At the next position X20, a similar set of limit switches 610 616 are employed for the heaters but as shown in FIGURE 17 control over the actuation of the heater groups the cylinders 406412 into two pairs as indicated at output positions Y6 and Y7.Heaters on the short side, specifically controlled by cylinders 406 and 410, are grouped together and the heaters on the long side, controlled by cylinders 408 and 412, are grouped together. When the heaters have been pivoted in to their operating position the normally closed switches 610 616 will be open and when the heaters are out away from the jar, switches 610 616 will be closed. Movement of the heaters up and down is controlled by hydraulic cylinder 414 with output coming from position Y2 onFIGURE 17 and when the heaters are moved down limit switch 600 will tripped closed to generate an input signal at position X21. Turning to the next two input positions X22 and X23 they respectively refer to inputs from the use of the clearance cylinder 338. This is a dual position cylinder and as is indicated from the output board at positions Y9 and Y10 two separate solenoids are used to provide the desired up and down control. Limit switches 368 and 370 respectively indicate when the welding head is down or up and as was indicated previously the head would move down at the beginning of the cycle and will be raised at the end of the cycle merely to allow clearance beneath the welding head for outgoing and incoming jars and their covers. In between these two periods cylinder 338 is not actuated. The cover pickup cylinder 570 is provided with one internal red switch indicated on FIGURE 16 at RSl to indicate when the pickup cylinder is in its down position at which point the cover has been released. Pickup cylinder is controlled by an output signal from the Y8 position on FIGURE 17 and will be controlled by its own separate solenoid located within the pneumatic manifold 124. The next three positions on the input controller X26X28 relate to the limit switches 170, 172 and 174 on deck 160 for respectively indicating that battery jars are either in the load station, the weld station or the unload station. We have found it is desirable to not permit the transfer carriage assembly 116 to return to its initial position immediately after having feed a new battery jar to the weld station and removed a finished welding jar to the unload station. Also, return is not permitted unless the arms have been folded back to their in positions nor until the unload station has been cleared of a battery jar. Other arrangements could, however, be built into the system if a different mode of operation was desired. Finally, at position X29 two limit switches 252 and 268 are used to indicate to the controller when the arms on the carriage are back in their in position so that when those two switches have been closed. Returning once again to the output board in FIGURE 17 the Y0 position will produce an output signal to burn on light 656 indicating the controller is in its automatic cycle sequence. Positions Y1 and Y2 have already been described. Position Y3 relates to the outputs to the solenoid controlling cylinder 348 which is the main cylinder controlling the actuation of the welding head assembly 118 during the heating and welding cycles. Likewise, the next position at Y4 relates to the output for the cylinoid controlling the actuation of the heat stop cylinders 346 and 350 that control the downward movement of the welding head assembly 18 by cylinder 348 during the heating cycle. The output at position Y5 generates an indication of a fault and serves to light a red lamp 658 to indicate that condition. Such a fault condition will occur if the height of the jar is outside the acceptable range for any particular sequence of jars. In that instance, the welding heating sequence would be held up. At positions Y 11 and Y12 outputs are provided for solenoids controlling the movement of the transfer carriage assembly 116 and in partie ular actuation of hydraulic cylinder 270. At output positions Y13 and Y14 outputs are provided for the solenoids that control hydraulic motor 322 in control of the jack assembly 320. At output positionY 15 an output signal is produced to control the actuation of cylinders 244 and 264. As an exemplary program Table 1 is provided which sets forth a program listing for a typical program controliing the operation of the welding apparatus including the communication of the data, the control and operation of relays or solenoids and the appropriate control of contacts. This program listing would be used with the 5TI 2000 programmer in order to establish the control sequence that the sequence will operate under. It should be pointed out, with reference to FIGURE 18, that during the heating step beads of thermoplastic material are formed both exteriorly and interiorly as shown. Thus, during the pressure step as shown in FIGURE 14g these beads continue to be formed or enlarged, with the gap between skirt and the interior surface of the battery jar providing a flow path along which these beads can pass so that the degraded material can be completely removed from between the weld surfaces. In addition, the heating not only creates the primary horizontal weld surface between surfaces 46 and 116 of the cover battery jar but the flowing of thermoplastic material past surface 114 and in contact with the melted portion of the guide bars 112 forms a second and vertical weld between skirt 52, guide members 112 and the interior surface 54 of battery jar 110.This homogeneous weld area is shown in phantom in FIGURE 19 and will provide an extremely strong joint between cover 10 and battery jar 110. Pursuant to the above procedures we have found that we can obtian stronger joints that have an area relatively larger than the thickness of the side wall so that the joint is not weaker than the tensile strength of that side wall. We have obtained a joint that is more reliably welded and because of the guidance and alignment capability provided by guide pins 112 during and prior to the point of contact of surfaces 46 and 116 following heating we can achieve better control over the welding process. Further, because of the gap existing between surface 112 and the interior surface 54 we can use what would otherwise be wasted extruded material in order to form a second vertical weld between those surfaces.The presence of guide pins 112 also allows the ability to work with distorted battery jars which will become more a problem as the sidewall thicknesses of battery jars are decreased. Turning first to FIGURES 20 and 22, the cover accord ing to the present invention is generally indicated at 700 and is comprised of a main plate member 702. The cover is provided with a depending rim portion, generally indicated at 704, although plate member 702 could also be formed as a substantially flat plate. Cover 700 is provided with a centrally positioned vent hole, generally indicated at 706, which is provided with depending skirt portions 708 and 710, the bottom which define a horizontal plane indicated at 712. A gap 714 is provided between skirt portions 708 and 710 so that the vent hold 706 can collect gases which may accumulate within the battery during its use. Cover 700 is also provided with a plurality of additional openings indicated at 716, so that terminal posts from electrodes that will subsequently be positioned within the battery jar can extend through cover 700. Depending downwardly from the bottom surface of cover 700 and extending about the periphery thereof, is a flange or skirt member generally indicated at 718. The height of this skirt member from the bottom surface of the edge portion number 700 is about .93 inches and is provided with a front or exterior surface 720 having about a 1 degree taper and a rear surface not shown which has about a 3 degree taper with this tapered condition being present to facilitate demolding. With reference now to FIGURE 20, a plurality of guide pins also depend from the bottom surface of cover 704 with these guide pins being indicated at 722 734. The guide pins 722 734 are preferably located at spaced apart locations about the periphery of the cover with the spacings being about one inch along each side.The spacing therebetween the pins at the corners lying on opposite sides may be less than about one inch. Together guide pins 722 734 and the flange and skirt member 718 form a continuous member which extends about the periphery of the bottom edge of the outer portion of cover 700. While guide posts 722 734 can be placed about an inch apart, the exact spacing between the guide pins can be greater or lesser amounts, it only being important that they be spaced close enough together so as to both straighten the upper edge or rim of the battery jar as the cover is placed as the pins are inserted into the battery jar and so that the sidewalls will not be rippled when the cover and the pins are in place.Likewise, it is also important that enough pins be used to provide sufficiewnt camming action during insertion to cure any bowing problems that may be present in the sidewalls of the battery jar. The length of corner pins 722, 724, 732 and 734, respectively, as shown in FIGURE 20, have a length of approximately three quarters of an inch .75 inches and are provided with sloped bottom surfaces, having a taper of approximately 30 degrees although greater or lesser amounts of taper could be employed as this surface really serves as a guide to help insert the guide pins into the battery jar. The next guide pins positioned along the side shown inFIGURE 20, specifically pins 726 and 730, are shorter and have a length of approximately .62 inches whereas the centralmost guide pin 728 is shorter and yet has a length of about 1 2 inch .50 inches . As shown in FIGURE 20, plane 712 established by the bottom of skirts 708 and 710 lies blow the bottom of the longest guide pins 722, 724, 732 and 734. When these pins are about .75 inches in length, a gap of about .2 inches exists between these pins and plane 712. Thus, the corner pins could be .2 inches longer with the cover still being equally as stackable for shipping puposes if the cover had a flat upper surface. Alternatively, for the structure shown in FIGURE 20, the length of these corner posts could also be extended by an extra distance equal to the depth of the recessed outer edge indicated at 704. In any event, it is only desirable to have the corner pins relatively longer and the more centrally located pins along each side shorter so as to insure proper initial placement of cover 700 within a battery jar. Turning next to FIGURE 21 which shows the length of the cover shown in FIGURE 1, the centrally located pins on this side, indicated at 736 and 738, have a length of about V2 inch .50 inches which are equal in length to the most centrally located pin 728 shown in FIGURE 20. In FIGURE 22, a longer battery cover is shown with six guide pins being employed instead of four as shown in FIGURE 21.These guide pins are indicated by reference numerals 744 754. The outer or corner guide pins 744 and 754 have a length of about 3 4 inches .75 inches whereas the next most inward set, guide pins 746 and 752, have a length of about .62 inches with guide pins 748 and 750 located in the central portion of the side have a length of U2 inch .50 inches similar to the centrally positioned guide pins 736, 738 and 728 in the first embodiment shown in FIGURES 20 and 21. The cover can be welded into place within a battery jar in accordance with the method and apparatus disclosed hereinabove. In this regard it is important to note that the shortest pins, namely those located in the center of each side, need only be longer than the height to which cover 700 is raised upwardly out of the battery jar during the welding operation. This will assure that those particular guide pins will not be removed from engagement with the interior surface of the battery jar sidewall so that following the heating cycle the cover can be easily and quickly accomplished without losing the desired registry between the pins and the sidewalls of the battery jar established following their initial insertion into that battery jar.
