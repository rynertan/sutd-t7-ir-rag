# AN ELECTRIC MOTOR FRAME

## Abstract
A frame of the motor comprises first and second rigid bearing supports 1 and 2 connected together by connecting members 3 and 4 and formed, respectively, with coaxial internal surfaces 5 and 6 which receive bearings 7 for the shaft 8 of an electric motor. The first bearing support 1 is formed with a radial slot 9 so that, before the bearings 7 are seated within the bearing supports 1 and 2 , one end of the shaft 8 can be passed axially through the second bearing support 2 and the other end of the shaft 8 can be moved radially through the slot 9 into and out of a position in alignment with the axis 10 of the surfaces 5 and 6 . The slot 9 is narrow enough to ensure that the internal surface 5 is capable of supporting the bearing 7 in all radial directions.
