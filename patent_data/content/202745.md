## Description
This invention relates to a method for moveout correction and stacking velocity estimation of offset vertical seismic profile data. In many cases, Vertical Seismic Profiles VSP must be conducted with the source placed at considerable distance from the well. The reasons for this are usually a practical nature for example, source induced noise such as casing ring and tube waves can obscure reflection events when the source is close to the well, the configuration of the drilling support equipment on a well pad may necessitate placement of a source at some distance from the well and local land conditions may dictate the source placement. The most frequent demand for long offset VSP data acquisition is the requirement for tube wave suppression. Empirically, it is found that the amplitude of tube waves diminishes with increasing source offset from a well. In addition, the time delay of seismic reflection events resulting from a long offset source is usually less than the delay of tube wave inception. This tends to keep reflection events well separated from tube waves, resulting in much better VSP data quality. Borehole seismic acquisition programs can be designed to obtain data at multiple long offsets for a number of reasons. Applications include the provision of offset seismic profiles recorded in a well that are directly correlative to well log data, the acquisition of seismic data free of surface organized noise, the determination of seismic transmission and reflection properties with offset and depth, acquisition of data appropriate for tomography inversion and imaging, the delineation of reservoir properties when offset VSP profiles are conducted in a field for several wells with 2 D or 3 D applications and determination of depth and inter reflector velocities of reflectors below the borehole Total Depth TD from lookahead VSP data. For purposes of this application, the terms offset VSP , lateral seismic profile , and offset seismic profile in a well are used as equivalent terms, meaning either seismic data acquisition for a multiplicity of receivers in a well recording data from each of a multiplicity of sources on the surface or the reciprocal situation for which a multiplicity of receivers on the surface record data from each of a multiplicity of source locations in the well. Offset VSP processing has not been as extensively developed as surface seismic data processing or conventional VSP processing. Conventional VSP data processing assumes that the source offset from the well is essentially zero. One of the greatest developments of this century in reflection seismology has been Common Depth Point CDP stacking. This concept utilizes the near hyperbolicity of primary seismic reflection arrivals to align redundant reflections obtained from multiple shot receiver experiments conducted on the earth s surface. Some geophysical contractors approach the problem of aligning reflections from offset VSP data through ray tracing. Surface seismic data may be moveout corrected by ray tracing, but it is far more common to employ a hyperbolic moveout correction formula and develop velocity spectra in the applications. The asymmetry of the shot and receiver locations in offset VSP precludes the possibility of CDP stacking exactly as in surface seismic data processing. In GB A 1569582 there is described a method of processing seismic signals particularly in the delineating of an oil or gas reservoir when at least one borehole exists close to or penetrating the reservoir. In EP A 0117280 there is described a VSP method in which VSP seismic data is transformed into surface seismic data by mapping segments of the VSP seismic data in surface seismic data time. The transformation is claimed in the specification to result in data which is more easily intepreted with respect to determining subsurface structure because the data is stacked and because the data is in a more conventional form. In an article in Oil Gas Journal, Vol. 80, 1982, Oct, No. 42 pages 77 to 82 there is disclosed a VSPCDP vertical seismic profile common depth point stacking procedure. In this reference there is disclosed moveout correction and stacking of VSP data through a technique conventionally known as ray tracing. According to the present invention there is provided a method for moveout correcting and estimating stacking velocities for offset VSP data comprising the steps of In the accompanying drawings, Referring to Figure 1, in the system shown acoustic pulse sources 14, 16, 18, 20 and 22 are located on the earth s surface 12 at different distances x from a borehole 24 in which an acoustic pulse receiver 26 is suspended. A travel path 28 is illustrated as the path of an acoustic pulse from acoustic source 18 to a reflector 30. Ray path 32 is the path of an acoustic pulse from source 18 that has been reflected off reflector 30 and received by receiver 26. Ray path 34 is the path of an acoustic pulse generated by source 18 and traveling directly to receiver 26, normally called the first break path. In the execution of a standard vertical seismic profile, the seismic source and receiver are regarded to be nearly on the same vertical line. Primary seismic reflections obtained from a receiver located at various depths may be aligned or flattened by adding the one way first break time T When the source and receiver are not on the same vertical line and the VSP is executed with long offsets, a different procedure for aligning primary reflections will be required. According to Appendix I, for flat layers ϑ 0 , the primary reflection travel time T is given by where x is the offset distance of the source from the borehole, z which is the two way, normal incidence travel time to a reflector at depth z₀ from the surface z 0. At offset x 0, At offset x 0 and depth z It follows that This last formula is reminiscent of the hyperbolic stacking formula used in NMO corrections for CDP gathered data. Formula 5 cannot be adapted to variable velocity media. In order to indicate why this cannot be done, the following interpretations are assumed. The first break time T The first break times T This last formula is the type of moveout correction we seek for offset VSP data because it allows the determination of velocity spectra can be selected and optimal parameters t appearing in formula 7 , is difficult to interpret because of the asymmetry of ray paths. Unless the receiver is on the surface, a downgoing ray path encounters a different set of velocities than the upgoing ray path. An offset VSP moveout formula is disclosed by the present invention in which the velocities are completely interpretable. This formula applies to laterally homogeneous media. Formula 1 may be interpreted in several different ways. If one assumes that The remaining coefficient, z If one solves for t This gives t This last result shows that for zero offset, formula 10 reduces to the conventional method of aligning reflection events from VSP traces obtained for multiple depths z Another estimate is possible we can approve of assumption 8 but not 6 , then with a variable velocity v When this equation is solved for the two way travel time t The form of equation 12 is amenable to the computation of velocity spectra, but the interpretation of the velocity v This implies that at zero offset, v This means that v 1 s appearing in formula 12 takes the value of the average slowness at zero offset. Referring now to FIGURE 2, a more detailed illustration of FIGURE 1 is presented. If the point at which an acoustic pulse traveling down path 28 meets with reflector 30 is labeled as X The offset VSP stacking velocities introduced in formulae 7 and 11 are difficult to interpret. For surface seismic data, in layered media, the stacking velocity for a CDP gather, to a second order approximation in offset, is the RMS velocity. In FIGURE 2, the VSP ray path in media with constant velocity v₀ is shown to be extended to surface 12. Since triangles xx is valid. Equation 14 may be solved for x In FIGURE 2, x so that Substitution of equation 15 into equation 16 provides the result According to FIGURE 2, the distance between the point where extended VSP ray 32 meets surface 12 and source 18 is X and Let the reflection time for the surface to surface ray path be T or Moreover, for layered media to a second order approximation in offset distance X₂ where v whence follows from equation 18 Substitution of equation 20 into equation 19 leads to the result The offset VSP travel time T is obtained from the surface to surface travel time T We notice that if ζ x, then which are recorded data, namely the first break times at offset ζ x. The times T and where equation 17 and the same estimates used in formula 21 have been introduced into formula 22 with ζ Δx. It follows that It remains to substitute the results of formulae 21 and 25 into the equation, This formula can be used to obtain velocity spectra in a way that allows the stacking velocities to be interpretable. The velocities appearing in formula 26 are the familiar RMS velocities that are estimated by means of stacking velocities in surface seismic data processing. The asymmetry in offset VSP source receiver placement is manifest in the requirement that v For the source at zero offset x 0, formula 26 reduces to the standard VSP time shift for aligning primary reflections In the special case that the receiver is on the surface, z which resembles the standard hyperbolic moveout correction formula for surface seismic data. For a constant velocity medium, This shows that formula 30 is exactly formula 7 for a constant velocity. In order to examine the accuracy of the offset VSP moveout correction formula 26 , consider FIGURE 3 which depicts a model of five flat reflectors separating layers with the indicated interval velocities. The Sierra, VSP ray trace program was used to generate offset VSP data based on this model. Geophones were located in the borehole from depths of 50 feet 15.24m to 3750 feet 1143m in increments of 50 feet 15.24m and a source was placed on the surface from 100 feet 30.48m offset to the well to 5000 feet 1524m offset to the well in increments of 100 feet 30.48m . Tables 1 and 2 of Appendix 2 compare the ray trace times T x,z In equation 31 , v t is the interval velocity and t may be either one way or two way normal incidence travel time. FIGURE 4 shows the results of ray tracing with the Sierra offset VSP algorithm applied to the five reflector model of FIGURE 3 with the source offset 3,000 feet 914.4m . Except for the first break events on each trace, the only other events in the seismogram are upcoming arrivals of the primary reflections from the five interfaces in the model. It is usual practice to mute the first breaks on all traces in processing VSP reflection data and appropriate mutes were applied to the data in FIGURE 4 as a conventional preprocessing step. In order to demonstrate the application of formula 26 , the reflections from reflector R₁ and R₂ were removed from the seismogram in FIGURE 4 because they were very shallow and the critical offset for reflector R₁ is only about 626 feet 190.8m . The remaining three reflectors were processed by the conventional VSP processing in which a static time shift equal to T FIGURE 5 shows the result of applying conventional VSP processing to these data and that a residual correction must be applied to these data to bring reflection events into alignment. In FIGURE 6, the same data have been dynamically corrected using the offset VSP moveout correction formula 26 . In the course of moveout correcting these data, the actual values of v There are several methods of implementing formula 26 to accomplish offset VSP moveout corrections. These methods differ in the selection of velocities and offset VSP traces used in velocity estimation. In implementing formula 26 , all times appearing on the right hand side of formula 26 are converted to two way times. The two way first break times t then the set of T The offset VSP data traces are defined to be D x,z The VSP data trace will be sampled in time at a rate t, which will be 1, 2, or 4 milliseconds or some other specified increment. The moveout corrected trace D The value T In the course of computing the moveout correction times, it is necessary to obtain Another version of the offset VSP moveout correction is possible. This estimate does not require that the seismic wave, received in the borehole, be extrapolated to the surface. The derivation of the alternate formula will contain the same order of approximations as in equation 19 . With reference to FIGURE 2, the VSP moveout time estimate is where and and with the same estimate for h as used above, we conclude that The quantity V Replacement of equations 34 , 35 and 36 into equation 33 leads to the alternative VSP moveout correction formula The application of formula 37 is similar to formula 26 . The VSP moveout prediction given by formula 26 is slightly better than the corresponding prediction given by formula 37 when the geophone is relatively near the reflector, while formula 37 performs slightly better than formula 26 when the geophone is relatively far from the reflector. More often than not, when the geophone is in a shallow position in the well, reflection data of marginal quality are recorded in VSP s for deep reflector locations, and better reflection data are recorded when the geophone is near the reflector. For these reasons, formula 26 is preferred to formula 37 in most applications. Several methods of introducing velocities into formula 26 will now be discussed, together with appropriate means of trace selection to complete the velocity analysis. The most simple method of introducing velocities into formula 26 is to use the RMS velocities derived from the analysis of the first break times where An offset VSP, constant velocity CV stack is defined as follows At fixed offset x, define a suite of sweep velocities v For an offset VSP consisting of multiple sources in a line away from a well, the offset VSP CV stack described in Method II above can be applied to data traces for each fixed source offset x. If the depth sampling The main features of Method II are retained, but, in each interval t The features of Method II are retained however, stacking velocity analysis is to be performed in the common reflection point bins, as described hereinafter below. For an offset VSP, the multiplicity of shots should provide the requisite redundancy of reflections on data traces for each bin. The inequalities 46 provide the time windows in each bin for determining optimal reflection alignment through offset VSP CV stacks. In equation 15 , the relationship among the variables reflection point x Reflections issuing from approximately the same subsurface location is a concept similar to CDP gather and is demonstrated by the present invention. In FIGURE 7, the interval between the well at offset 0 and the midpoint between the well and the source at offset 1,000 is partitioned into six equal intervals called bins. As illustrated in FIGURE 7, for the reflector at 10,000 feet of depth, subsurface reflection points will be contained in bin 3, provided we restrict the geophone depths between approximately 6,800 feet and 8,100 feet of depth. This simple illustration serves to define the concept of binning. In practical applications, the velocity will be variable and the reflector depths will be measured in two way travel times. In order to accommodate this situation, bins of common reflection points are formed based on the travel time information. The goal of this section will be to stack offset moveout corrected VSP data in bins of common subsurface reflection locations. An important consideration in all that follows is the stocking analysis applies to VSP movement corrected data. An application of formula 15 with the same estimates stated after equation 19 leads to the formula where x In formula 38 , and clearly VSP data has been obtained in a well at It is required to chose the number of bins N. If the bins are too coarse, reflections will be stacked over a wide portion of a reflector and will be smeared, whereas, if the bins are too fine, stacking will be nearly at a subsurface point but the time window contributing to the stack may be too small to be useful. Once the number of bins are chosen, the resulting traces are to be stacked and placed at the centers of the bins, namely In formula 40 , λ has the value n 2N so that For each VSP trace In order to bin and stack the VSP traces, proceed as follows For the trace to be placed at 1 4N . x For the trace to be placed at The quantity λ is strictly defined on 0,1 2 and with λ n 2N , we will be outside the interval of definition when n N. In equation 43 , the value n N also leads to a computational difficulty. We surmount this difficulty by observing t When the above defined segments of traces are summed, there will be overlap resulting in fold. Prior to summing, fold on each segment of a trace must be determined and appropriate weights must be applied to the segments of the unstacked data so that all portions of a stacked trace will be balanced. If the fold on a particular segment of a trace is M, then the natural weight to choose for balancing the stacked traced will be 1 M on each portion of a trace contributing to that segment. If there are many shot points in a line away from the well at offsets x as depicted in FIGURE 8. Now recall the definition We desire to construct a partition of 0,1 2 through the variable λ n,p given as. The centers of these intervals in the partitions are Stacked offset VSP traces will be placed at the centers of the bins which have offset coordinates Equation 40 can now be invoked to define We have offset VSP data traces In order to bin and stack the offset VSP traces, we proceed as follows mute all offset VSP traces, k 1,2,...,K and p 1,2,...,P, except for the time intervals These are the live portions of the traces which are subsequently summed over all receiver depths The two comments following equation 44 apply here and the following prescription in the implementation is suggested In the inequality 51 , the geophone depth location will be k 1,2,...,K and the shot offset range will be p n 1, n 2,...,P. When these portions of the offset VSP traces are sorted out, it is a straightforward matter to determine fold in various time windows. Thus, a method for segregating and stacking offset vertical seismic profile data has been demonstrated. Curves of constant reflector two way traveltime are constructed depending on receiver depth and source offset. The distance between the borehole and shot point is divided into a predetermined number of segments called bins. Depths at which acoustic pulse receivers are to be located are selected. The area determined by the intersection of the bin segment boundaries and the two way travel time to the receiver depth crossing curves of the constant two way travel times to reflectors is sectioned. All reflector two way travel times corresponding to the said travel time section are identified as suitable for stacking at the center of the preselected bin the binned data are stacked with a weight depending on fold.
