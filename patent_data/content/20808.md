# Support, catalyst and process for polymerizing olefins.

## Abstract
A catalyst for the polymerization of olefins is prepared by the reaction of a aliphatic alcohol such as n propyl alcohol with a mixture of an alkyl magnesium compound such as n butyl, sec butyl magnesium and a silicon tetrahalide such as SiCl₄. After washing the precipitate several times with a hydrocarbon such as hexane, it is suspended in a hydrocarbon such as hexane and an organic titanium compound such as TiCl₄ is added after which a suitable reducing agent such as diethyl aluminium chloride is added at a temperature below 70 C. The thus formed solid catalyst is washed several times with a hydrocarbon solvent such as hexane and is then utilized for the polymerization of olefins.

## Description
SUPPORT, CATALYST AND PROCESS FOR POLYMERIZING OLEFINS This invention relates to catalyst supports, catalysts, process for preparing such catalyst supports and catalysts and process for polymerizing olefins. It is well known that olefins such as ethylene, propylene, and 1 butene can be polymerized in the presence of metallic catalysts, particularly the reaction products of organometallic compounds and transition metal compounds to form substantially unbranched polymers of relatively high molecular weight. Typically such polymerizations are carried out at relatively low temperatures and pressures.The resulting generally linear olefin polymers are characterized by greater stiffness and higher density than olefin polymers having highly branched polymer chains. Following polymerization, it is common to remove catalyst residue from the polymer by separating the polymer from the inert liquid diluent and then repeatedly treating the polymer with an alcohol or similar deactivating agent.Such catalyst deactivation and or removal procedures are expensive both in time and material consumed as well as the equipment required to carry out such treatment. Furthermore, most of the known catalyst systems are more efficient in preparing polyolefins in slurry i.e., wherein the polymer is not dissolved in the carrier than in solution i.e., wherein the temperature is high enough to solubilize the polymer in the carrier . The lower efficiencies of such catalysts in solution polymerization are generally believed to be caused by the general tendency of the catalysts to become rapidly depleted or deactivated by significantly higher temperatures than are normally employed in solution processes. In view of the expense of removing catalyst residues from the polymer, it would be highly desirable to provide a polymerization catalyst which is sufficiently active, even at solution polymerization temperatures, to produce such high quantities of polymer per unit of catalyst that it is no longer necesary to remove catalyst residue in order to obtain polymer of the desired purity.Among recent attempts to provide catalysts having high activity is that illustrated in U.S. Patent 4,115,319 issued September 19, 1978 and assigned to Montedison. The present invention, in one aspect, is a catalyst support prepared by the reaction of an aliphatic alcohol with a mixture of an organomagnesium compound and a silicon halide represented by the formula R 4 nSiXn in a non polar solvent. The solid product is then washed several times with a liquid hydrocarbon so as to remove the soluble components. It is preferred to prepare the support by the controlled addition of the alcohol to the mixture of organomagnesium compound and silicon halide. Alternatively, the mixture of organomagnesium compound and silicon halide can be added to the aliphatic alcohol. The reaction is not temperature dependent within normal chemical reaction limits except as desired to control the particle size of the catalyst support. In another aspect of the present invention, a catalyst is prepared by adding to the above described support a transition metal compound of the Groups 4b, Sb, 6b, 7b or 8 of Mendeleev s Periodic Table of Elements, followed by the controlled addition of a reducing agent while maintaining the temperature below 700C, preferably below 300C. After completion of the reaction, the solid catalyst is washed several times with a liquid hydrocarbon to remove the unreacted quantities of the reactants.Then, when desired, an aluminum alkyl co catalyst is added. The magnesium transition metal atomic ratio is desirably from 0.1 1 to 30 1, preferably from 0.5 1 to 3 1 and the aluminum transition metal atomic ratio is desirably from 5 1 to 200 1 preferably from 10 1 to 30 1. Still another aspect of the present invention is a process for polymerizing a olefins in the presence of the previously mentioned catalyst under conditions characteristic of Ziegler polymerization. The catalyst of the present invention provides a means for reducing polymer buildup on the reactor walls, control of the polymer particle size by varying the temperature at which the support is formed as well as limited control of the molecular weight distribution, low color in the polymer and a good bulk density when the polymer is produced by the slurry process. The catalyst also provides a high efficiency at a given magnesium titamium ratio and products having a generally uniform particle size. The present invention is most advantageously practiced in a polymerization process wherein an a olefin is polymerized, generally in the presence of hydrogen as a molecular. weight control agent, in a polymerization zone containing an inert diluent and the catalyst. The foregoing polymerization process is most beneficially carried out under inert atmosphere and relatively low temperature and pressure, although very high temperatures and pressures are optionally employed. Olefins which are suitably polymerized or copolymerized in the practice of this invention are the aliphatic a monoolefins having from 2 to 18 carbon atoms.Illustratively, such a olefins can include ethylene, propylene, butene l, pentene l, 3 methylbutene l, hexene l, octene l, dodecene l and octadecene l. It is understood that a olefins may be copolymerized with other olefins and or with other ethylenically unsaturated monomers such as butadiene, isoprene, pentadiene 1,3, styrene, a methylstyrene and similar ethylenically unsaturated monomers which do not destroy conventionalZiegler catalysts. Most benefits are realized in the polymerization of aliphatic a monoolefins particularly ethylene and mixtures of ethylene and up to 10, especially from 0.1 to 5, weight percent of propylene, butene l, hexene 1, octene 1 or similar higher a olefin based on total monomer. The catalyst support employed herein is that solid product resulting from the reaction of a aliphatic alcohol R OH with a mixture of a hydrocarbon soluble organomagnesium compound MgR2 and a silicon halide R 4 nSiXn , in a non polar solvent, wherein the molar ratio of ROH MgR2 is preferably at least 2 1 and the molar ratio of ROH R 4 nSiXn is such that there is present at least one, preferably 2 to 3 X groups per OH group. Suitable non polar solvents for the mixture of organomagnesium compound and silicon halide include, for example, aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons having from 5 to 10, preferably from 6 to 8 carbon atoms such as, for example, pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, nonane, decane, benzene, toluene, xylene, and mixtures thereof. The preferred hydrocarbon is that which is ultimately to be employed in the a olefin polymerization reaction. The purpose of employing the mixture of organo magnesium compound and the silicon halide in a non polar solvent is to prevent the usual reaction which occurs when such compounds are employed in polar solvents such as diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran. The criteria for the ratios of reactants is that there should be present at least one equivalent of alcohol for each alkyl group contained in the organomagnesium compound. Suitable organomagnesium compounds are those represented by the formula MgR2 which are hydrocarbon soluble wherein each R is independently an aliphatic hydrocarbon group having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, preferably from 2 to 8 carbon atoms such as, for example, butyl isobutyl magnesium, butyl hexyl magnesium, dihexyl magnesium, dioctyl magnesium, 3 hexenyl hexyl magnesium, di 3 hexenyl magnesium, and mixtures thereof. Also included are organomagnesium compounds represented by the above formula, MgR2, which are hydrocarbon insoluble, but are readily rendered hydrocarbon soluble by the addition of small solubilizing quantities, e.g. from 5 to 50 , preferably from 10 to 20 by weight of an organo aluminum compound such as triisobutylaluminum, triethylaluminum or other alkyl aluminum compounds or other suitable solubilizing compound which does not poison Ziegler polymerization catalysts. Such organomagnesium compounds which are normally insoluble in hydrocarbons but which can be rendered soluble as above stated include, for example, dibutyl magnesium, ethyl butyl magnesium, ethyl hexyl magnesium, and mixtures thereof. The use of such compounds as mentioned above includes the solubilizing quantity of the organo aluminum compound. In some instances, it may be desirable to add small quantities of an organo aluminum compound even though the organomagnesium compound is sufficiently soluble so as to lower the viscosity. Suitable silicon halide compounds which can be employed herein include those compounds wherein R is an alkyl group of from 1 20 carbons, preferably from 1 to 6, most preferably from 1 to 2 carbon atoms and X is C1, Br or I and n has a value of from 1 to 4 such as, for example,SiCl4, SiBr4, CH3SiC13, C2H5 2SiCl2, CH3 3SiCl, and mixtures thereof. Suitable aliphatic alcohols R OH which can be employed herein include those having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, preferably from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, such as, for example, methanol, ethanol, n propanol, n butanol, sec butanol, tert butanol, octadecanol, 2 propen 1 ol, 2 buten 1 ol, and mixtures thereof. The temperature of the ROH and mixture of organomagnesium compound and silicon halide is usually maintained from OOC to the boiling point of the hydrocarbon in which the organomagnesium compound and silicon halide is dissolved, preferably from 1000C or less and more preferably from OOC to 700C, to control the particle size of the support and subsequently the particle size of the polymer. If during the preparation of the support, the temperature employed is above 400C, the temperature should be, immediately after completion of the reaction, lowered to at least 250C so as to prevent sintering aggregation of the particles. The reaction is essentially instantaneous with the addition of the alcohol which is added incrementally so as to aid in the contol of the temperature since the reaction is exothermic. The thus prepared support is then washed with a liquid hydrocarbon so as to remove any of the unreacted reactants and soluble by products. Suitable hydrocarbons include, for example, those having from 6 to 8, carbon atoms, such as, pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, nonane, decane, benzene, toluene, xylene, and mixtures thereof.The preferred hydrocarbon is that which is ultimately to be employed in the a olefin polymerization reaction. The catalyst of this invention is prepared by adding to the above prepared support suspended in any of the aforementioned hydrocarbons, a transition metal compound followed by the controlled addition of a suitable reducing agent such that the reaction temperature is maintained below 70at, preferably below 400C and most preferably below 300C. The hydrocarbon is removed by any suitable means such as decantation, filtration or the like and the solid catalyst is washed with hydrocarbon to remove any unreacted materials. The atomic ratio of magnesium contained in the support to the transition metal employed is desirably from 0.1 1 to 30 1, preferably from 0.1 1 to 3 1. The above prepared catalyst can then be employed either alone or in the presence of, as a co catalyst, an organometallic compound which is a halide, hydride or totally alkylated derivative of the metals of Groups la, 2a, 2b, 3a or 4a of the Periodic Table such as, for example, triisobutyl aluminum, triethyl aluminum, diethylaluminum chloride, ethylmagnesium bromide, diiso butylaluminum hydride, mixtures thereof and the like, so as to provide a metal Group la, 2a, 2b, 3a or 4a transition metal atomic ratio of, desirably, from 1 1 to 200 1 preferably from 10 1 to 30 1. Exemplary transition metal compounds include, for example, the halides, such as the chlorides, bromides, and iodides of the transition metals of Groups 4b, 5b, 6b, 7b and 8 of Mendeleev s Periodic Table of Elements as set forth in Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, CRC, 48thEdition 1967 68 . Exemplary metals include, for example, titanium, chromium, zirconium, vanadium, tungsten, manganese, molybdenum, ruthenium, rhodium, cobalt, and nickel with titanium, vanadium and zirconium either separately or in combination being preferred. Exemplary preferred transition metal compounds are titanium tetrachloride, titanium trichloride, zirconium tetrachloride, vanadium tetrachloride, vanadium pentachloride, vanadium oxydichloride with the halides, particularly the chlorides, of titanium being most preferred. Exemplary reducing agents are those of conventional Ziegler catalysts including metals such as aluminum, sodium and lithium hydrides thereof such as lithium hydride, or sodium borohydride Grignard reagents such as phenylmagnesium bromide and preferably organometallic compounds, especially alkly aluminum compounds.For the purposes of illustration, the especially preferred alkyl aluminum compounds can be represented by the general formula RA1zZ wherein R is alkyl, most advantageously containing from 1 to 12 carbon atoms, Y is aikyl, most advantageously from 1 to 12 carbon atoms, or hydrogen and Y is alkyl, most advantageously from 1 to 12 atoms, hydrogen, or halogen, e.g., chlorine or bromine, with the proviso that when Y is halogen Y is alkyl. Examples of especially preferred compounds corresponding to the formula RAlYY , include trimethylaluminum, triethylaluminum, triisobutylaluminum, tri n butylaluminum, tri n pentylaluminum, triisooctylaluminum, tri n decylaluminum, tri n dodecylaluminum, diethylaluminum chloride, and diethylaluminum hydride.Especially preferred are triethylaluminum and triisobutylaluminum. Other organometallic compounds which are suitable include, for example, butyllithium, amylsodium, phenylsodium, dimethylmagnesium, diethylmagnesium, diethylzinc, butylmagnesium chloride and phenylmagnesium bromide. It is preferred to carry out the preparation of the catalyst composition in the presence of an inert diluent. Suitable inert organic diluents include, for example, liquified ethane, propane, isobutane, n butane, n hexane, the various isomeric hexanes, isooctane, isononane, paraffinic mixtures of alkanes having from 8 to 9 carbon atoms, cyclohexane, methylcyclopentane, dimethylcyclohexane, dodecane, industrial solvents composed of saturated or aromatic hydrocarbons such as kerosene, naphthas, and mixtures of any two or more of the foregoing, especially when freed of impurities which characteristically poison Ziegler catalysts, and especially those having boiling points in the range from 500C to 200 C. Also included as suitable inert diluents are benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, cumene, and decalin. Mixing of the catalyst components to provide the desired catalyst composition is advantageously carried out under an inert atmosphere such as, for example, nitrogen, argon or other inert gas. In the polymerization process employing the aforementioned catalyst composition, polymerization is effected by adding a catalytic amount of the catalyst composition to a polymerization zone containing a olefin monomer, or vice versa. The polymerization zone is desirably maintained at temperatures in the range of from 0 to 3000C, preferably at slurry polymerization temperatures e.g., from 300 to 900C , for a residence time of 10 minutes to several hours, preferably from 15 minutes to 3 hours.It is generally desirable to carry out the polymerization in the absence of moisture and oxygen. The amount of the catalyst composition is advantageously within the range of from 0.0001 to 1 milligram atom of transition metal per liter of diluent. The most advantageous catalyst concentration depends upon polymerization conditions such as temperature, pressure, solvent and presence of catalyst poisons. In the polymerization process, a carrier, which may be an inert organic diluent or solvent or excess monomer, is generally employed. In order to realize the full benefit of the high efficiency catalyst of the present invention care must be taken to avoid oversaturation of the solvent with polymer. If such oversaturation occurs before the catalyst becomes depleted, the full efficiency of the catalyst is not realized.For best results, it is preferred that the amount of polymer in the carrier not exceed 50 weight percent based on the total weight of the reaction mixture. Inert diluents employed in the polymerization recipe are suitable as defined hereinbefore. The polymerization pressures usually employed are relatively low, e.g., from 40 to 500 psig 2.8 to 35 kg sg cm gauge . However, polymerization within the scope of the present invention can occur at pressures from atmospheric up to pressure determined by the capabilities of the polymerization equipment. During polymerization it is very desirable to stir the polymerization recipe to obtain better temperature control, to maintain uniform polymerization mixtures throughout the polymerization zone, and to insure contact between the olefin and the catalyst. Hydrogen is often employed in the practice of this invention to lower molecular weight of the resultant polymer. For the purpose of this invention, it is beneficial to employ hydrogen in concentrations ranging from 0.001 to 1 mole per mole of monomer. The larger amounts of hydrogen within this range are found to produce generally lower molecular weight polymers. It is understood that hydrogen can be added with a monomer stream to the polymerization vessel or separately added to the vessel before, during or after addition of the monomer to the polymerization vessel, but during or before the addition of the catalyst. The monomer or mixture of monomers is contacted with the catalyst composition in any conventional manner, preferably by bringing the catalyst composition and monomer together with intimate agitation provided by suitable stirring or other means. In the case of more rapid reactions with more active catalysts, means can be provided for refluxing monomer and solvent, if any of the latter is present, and thus remove the heat of reaction.In any event, adequate means should be provided for dissipating the exothermic heat of polymerization. If desired, the monomer can be brought in the vapor phase into contact with the catalyst composition, in the presence or absence of liquid material. The polymerization can be effected in the batch manner, or in a continuous manner, such as, for example, by passing the reaction mixture through an elongated reaction tube which is contacted externally with suitable cooling medium to maintain the desired reaction temperature, or by passing the reaction mixture through an equilibrium overflow reactor or a series of the same. The polymer is readily recovered from the polymerization mixture by driving off unreacted monomer and solvent if any is employed. No further removal of impurities is required. Thus, a significant advantage of the present invention is reduction of the catalyst residues remaining in the polymer. Often, the resultant polymer is found to contain insignificant amounts of catalyst residue such that catalyst removal procedures can be entirely eliminated. The following examples are given to illustrate the invention. EXAMPLE 1A. Preparation of Catalyst Support To a beaker was added 0.03 moles of a 0.5 molar solution of dihexyl magnesium in hexane.
