# Alkylation process for improved linear alkylbenzene recovery.

## Abstract
Alkylaromatic hydrocarbons are produced by the catalytic alkylation 4 of aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene, with Câ‚‡ plus acyclic olefins which preferably are normal olefins. The hydrocarbonaceous effluent of the alkylation reaction zone 4 is separated by fractional distillation 6, 9, 15, 18 to yield both a product stream 26 containing monoalkylated aro matics and a small bottoms stream 19 which contains di alkylated aromatics and other high boiling compounds but which is substantially devoid of the product monoalkylated aromatics. The product stream is a portion 26 of a sidecut stream 20 withdrawn from the first 15 of two vacuum co lumns 15, 18 , with a second portion 21 of the sidecut 20 being passed into the second column 18 . The bottoms stream 17 of the first column 15 is also passed into the second column 18 and the overhead vapor 25 from the second co lumn 18 enters an upper portion of the first column 15 .
