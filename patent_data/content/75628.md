# Beam intensity measurement system for raster scanners.

## Abstract
A raster scanner 10 has a laser 15 as a source of a scan beam 32 , an optical system including a rotary polygon 35 for scanning the laser beam 32 across the object 12 to be scanned, and a detector pair 53, 54 for identifying the start of scan SOS and end of scan EOS positions of the beam scanning path. One or both detectors 53, 54 are modified to incorporate a peak responding circuit which produces a signal whose voltage level represents the maximum intensity of the scan beam 32 as the scan beam 32 scans across the detector or detectors 53, 54 . The peak responding circuit includes an output tap permitting the peak signal to be read by a suitable voltage meter.
