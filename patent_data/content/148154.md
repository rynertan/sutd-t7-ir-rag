# PROCESS AND MEANS FOR STRIPPING AND TWISTING THE END OF ELECTRIC LEADS

## Abstract
The process comprise supplying of a coated lead 0723 to be prepared or, alternately, of operating means 50, 53, 54 , along a single path including, as in a single step the three operations, providing a track, both for a hand working and for an authomatic working, which is thus allowed. The working taking place substantially along at least two planes at right angles I and III upon a first movement I normal to the axis of the lead along a first plane I wherein the means 60, 60 operate providing the gathering which is coplanar but determining at least the direction of a second plane II at right angles with the first plane I a movement at right angles of the axis of the lead 0723 follows along a plane also normal to the first plane I and to itself II and determining a third plane III , at right angles with the first and second one I and II , wherein the third plane III and the second II plane are disposed as the lead 0723 and gathering 777 of the screening wires 7 . The system comprises at least three devices 50, 53, 54 , operating at least four steps one of stripping, one of parting and two of twisting. The process tools comprise a pair 50 of parting propellers 6, 6 , an helicoidal spiral or screw propeller 8 , at least partially conical, and particularly, is provided, at inner centripetal surfaces, of at least a blade tool 92 , whereby stripping and or twisting a stranded lead end 037, 047, 057 , even if of the screened 0723 or coaxial fashion 0723 are provided.
