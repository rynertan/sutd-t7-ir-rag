# SCREEN SYSTEM FOR OFFICES AND METHOD OF MAKING AND INSTALLING SAME

## Abstract
A partition screen includes a frame with vertical mem bers 33, 34 having semi circular outer edges with a gear segment 64 adjacent the top and bottom of each member provided with teeth projecting beyond the edges. Pins through the segments receive links to connect the screen to an adjacent screen or other structure having similar gear segments or slots so that the teeth of the gear segments interengage with the adjacent gear segments or slots. The gear segments are embodied in blocks 60, 61 and the teeth extend over only half of a semi circular face of each block so that by inverting the blocks the vertical portions of the segments may be adjusted within limits. Vertically adjust able guides 53 support the screen which includes acoustic insulation pads enclosed within a fabric sleeve 80 .
