# HELICOPTER ROTORS

## Abstract
A helicopter rotor includes attachment means for attach ing a rotor hub to a tubular rotor drive shaft in a manner es tablishing a primary thrust load path and further attachment means adapted to provide a normally passive secondary thrust load path and operative automatically to retain the rotor hub in the event of a failure in the primary thrust load path. In the de scribed embodiments the further attachment means comprise a multi part collet 21 consisting of a plurality of identical collet parts 22 located internally of the drive shaft. Each collet part has an external frust conical surface 23 one end for location adjacent a mating surface 24 formed internally of the drive shaft, and a radially extending flange portion 25 at its other end for attachment to an end surface of the drive shaft. The invention is applicable to main sustaining rotors and also to anti torque rotors.
