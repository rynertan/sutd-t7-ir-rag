# A sling structure for a motor vehicle.

## Abstract
A sling structure is defined by a flexible quadrilateral sheet panel which is defined by longitudinal side rails 22,24 of substantially inelastic material connected by a crossband structure 36,38 of elastic material extending between the side rails. One end of the flexible sheet panel is mounted on a vertical wall 16,18 of a vehicle body compartment 12 , preferably by a reel 32 for winding the flexible sheet panel to a stored position. The other end of the flexible sheet panel carries hooks 50,52 which engage a receptacle 62,64 in a vehicle floor 14 so that the sheet material is erected in a taut condition extending angularly between the floor and the vertical wall. The crossband structure is preferably divided into an upper crossband structure 36 and a lower cross band structure 38 with a space therebetween so that the seating of an occupant against the flexible sheet panel causes the upper crossband structure to yield to a more vertical seat back defining position and the lower crossband structure to yield to a more horizontal seat bottom defining position. The sling structure may be alternatively deployed at a horizontal orientation to define a bed or a cargo conceal ment panel by connecting the hooks at the end of the flexible sheet material with a receptacle 68 provided in the opposite vertical wall of the occupant compartment.
