## Description
POLYURETHANE ELASTOMERS CURED WITH 1,2 BIS 2 AMINOPHENYLTHIO ETHANE FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to improved polyurethane elastomers in general and, in particular, to polyurethane elastomers exhibiting improved mechanical properties when cured with 1, 2 bis 2 aminophenylthio ethane. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION For many years it has generally been recognized in the polyurethane art that aromatic diamines, particularly aromatic o substituted diamines, provide the best overall mechanical properties when used as curatives for isocyanateterminated polyurethane prepolymers. The most widely used aromatic diamine curative has been 4,4 methylenebis 2chloroaniline , known in the art as MOCA. Physical properties of MOCA cured polyurethane elastomers are quite good.However, the use of MOCA has had its attendant problems, most noteably its high melting point, which requires the user to exercise considerable care to obtain uniform mixes with the polymer. Furthermore, because the high melting point requires high mix temperatures, a shortened working life pot life, gel time of the mixture results. Nevertheless, in spite of its shortcomings, MOCA has enjoyed predominance as the best overall polyurethane curative while the search has continued for an effective aromatic diamine curative with a lower melting point and high reactivity.This search has been spurred recently by the implication ofMOCA as a suspected carcinogen. Hirosawa, U. S. Patent 3,920,617, discloses a method for curing polyurethane prepolymers with a new clab of diamine curatives represented by the formula EMI2.1 wherein R, among other things, is alkylene. One compound among the above class, namely, l,2 bis 2 aminophenylthio ethane, hereinafter sometimes called BATE, has been found to be a particularly suitable, low melting 73 78 C. , nontoxic diamine curative with reactivity similar to MOCA. Although mix temperatures are significantly lower, comparable cures with BATE versus MOCA, however, generally give poorer overall mechanical properties, particularly in hardness and compression set properties. Athey, in an article published in Jour. Ind. Eng.Chem., Vol 52, No. 7, July, 1960, pp. 611 612, discloses that the addition of small amounts of 2,4 tolylene diisocyanate to polyurethane polymers before vulcanization with MOCA increases hardness, modulus and resistance to compression set. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is based on the discovery that 1, 2 bis 2 aminophenylthio ethane provides excellent mechanical properties, including improved hardness and compression set properties, when the polyurethane prepolymer which it is used to cure is prepared from tolylene diisocyanate as the sole isocyanate and it contains from about 0.7 to 3.0 percent, by weight, of free, uncombined, monomeric 2,6 tolylene diisocyanate or mixtures thereof with 2 ,4 tolylene diisocyanate. Polyurethane prepolymers containing less than about 0.6 percent by weight of free, uncombined un reacted , monomeric tolylene diisocyanate, when cured with l,2 bis 2aminophenylthio ethane, exhibit mechanical properties significantly poorer than comparable MOCA cured elastomers, particularly in hardness and compression set. However, when monomeric tolylene diisocyanate is added to the prepolymer prior to mixing with l,2 bis 2 aminophenylthio ethane, the resulting cured elastomers exhibit mechanical properties equal to or better than comparable MOCA cured elastomers. These results are surprising and unexpected.Addition of monomeric tolylene diisocyanate to polyurethane prepolymers, in accordance with the present invention, permits the preparation of elastomers having a broad range of commercially useful mechanical properties using, as the curative, 1,2 bis 2 aminophenylthio ethane, whereas elastomers prepared without the addition of tolylene diisocyanate are deficient in one or more commercially important properties. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Polyurethane technology is very well developed and widely practiced. Polyurethane prepolymers, that is, isocyanate terminated polyurethane intermediates, are readily available commercially. They are prepared by the reaction of a polyol with a stoichiometric excess of an organic diisocyanate. Suitable polyols include polyester polyols, such as polyethyleneadipate, polypropyleneadipate, polybutyleneadipate, and the like, and mixtures thereof polyether polyols, such as polytetramethylene ether glycol, polypropylene ether glycol, and the like and polythioether polyols, such as polythiodiethanol, and the like. Although many diisocyanates have been used in the preparation of polyurethane prepolymers, including tolylene diisocyanate, methylenebis phenyl isocyanate , known as MDI, and m phenylene diisocyanate, for the purposes of the present invention, the prepolymers with which the invention is concerned are those prepared from tolylene diisocyanate 2,4 or 2,6 or isomeric mixtures thereof . In general, the ratio of isocyanate groups to hydroxyl groups used in making prepolymers may range from greater than 1 1 to 3 1 or higher. For practical purposes, however, prepolymers are prepared having an isocyanate to hydroxyl ratio of from about 1.5 1 to about 2 1. Depending on the molecular weight of the polyol, the total combined and uncombined isocyanate content NCO of the prepolymers will generally range from about 2.08 to about 8.0 .Polymer hardness increases with increasing isocyanate content. These prepolymers are described in detail in Saunders and Frisch, Polyurethanes Chemistry and Technology, Interscience Publishers, N. Y., N. Y., 1962 Poly urethane Technology, P. F. Bruins, Ed., Interscience Publishers, N. Y., N. Y., 1969 and K. F. Pigott, Polyurethanes, Encyclopedia of Poly. Sci. and Tech., Vol. 11, p. 503 563,John Wiley and Sons, Inc., N. Y., N. Y., 1969. In accordance with the present invention, a polyurethane prepolymer, prepared using tolylene diisocyanate,and generally having a total combined and uncombined isocyanate content ranging from about 2.0 to 8.0 percent, and having less than about 0.7 percent by weight, of free, uncombined, monomeric tolylene diisocyanate, is blended with monomeric 2,6 tolylene diisocyanate or isomeric mixtures thereof with 2,4 tolylene diisocyanate. When mixtures of the 2,6 and 2,4 isomers are used, the amount of the 2,6 isomer should constitute at least 20 , by weight, based on the total weight of the isocyanate mixture. The amount of 2,6 tolylene diisocyanate, added to the prepolymer should provide, in the prepolymer, before curing, from about 0.7 to 3.0 percent, by weight, of free, uncombined, monomeric tolylene diisocyanate.The amount of tolylene diisocyanate added will vary depending on the isocyanate content of the prepolymer, the amount in general increasing as the isocyanate content of the prepolymer increases. The invention is preferably applied to polyurethane prepolymers in which the free, uncombined monomeric isocyanate content is less than about 0.7 percent, still more preferably, less than about 0.5 percent by weight. The invention is more completely illustrated by the following examples. In the examples, the polyethyleneadipate polyurethane prepolymers which are used are the reaction products of polyethyleneadipate, having molecular weights ranging from about 500 to about 3500, with tolylene diisocyanate 80 20 2,4 2,6 isomer mixture using an NC0 OH ratio of 2.2 1. The prepolymers, after production, are stripped using a rotary vacuum stripper to remove most of the excess uncombined tolylene diisocyanate remaining therein. The stripped prepolymers are then cured with from about 80 to about 100 percent of the stoichiometrically required amount, based on the total amount of combined and uncombined isocyanate, of 1,2 bis 2 aminophenylthio ethane, at a temperature of 800C., preferably 85 900C.The mixtures are compression molded for about one hour at the above temperatures and then post cured in an oven at the same temperatures, for about 16 hours. The amount of free, uncombined monomeric tolylene diisocyanate in the prepolymers is determined by the method described in ASTM D2615 70. Example 1 Comparative A polyurethane prepolymer is prepared by reacting polyethylene adipate molecular weight 2100 with tolylene diisocyanate TDI 80 2,4 20 2,6 at an NC0 OH ratio of 2.2 1. The resulting prepolymer is stripped in vacuo to remove untreated TDI. The total combined and uncombined isocyanate content of the prepolymer is 3.1 and the monomeric uncombined TDI content is 0.24 . A portion of the polymer is mixed at 1000C. with 85 of the stoichiometric amount of l,2 bis 2 aminophenylthio ethane and cured by compression molding for one hour at 1000C., followed by post curing at 1000C. for 16 hours.Physical properties obtained are as follows TDI monomeric 0.24Pot life, mins. 5Gel life, mins. 25Hardness, Shore A ASTM D676 Cold room temp. 70 Hot 1000C. 60Modulus, psi commat ASTM D412 100 304 300 507Tensile strength, psi ASTM D412 5691Elongation, ASTM D412 637Compression Set, ASTM D575 Method B 56 Examples 2 3 Two portions of the stripped prepolymer of Example 1 are mixed with a monomeric mixture of 2,6 and 2,4 TDI 70 30 to bring the level of free, uncombined TDI to 2 0.75 and 3 1.0 and the prepolymers are then cured in the same manner.Physical properties are given below Example 2 Example 3 TDI 0.75 1.0Pot life, mins. 3 3Gel time, mins. 16 5Hardness, Shore A Cold 75 76 Hot 76 76Modulus, psi, commat 100 391 418 300 745 756Tensile, psi 6103 5512Elongation, 632 644Compression Set, Method B 30.5 24.4 The results of Examples 1 3 illustrate that cures with 1, 2 bis 2 aminophenylthio ethane give improved physical properties when free TDI is present in the prepolymer.Hot and cold hardness are improved and the compression set is significantly reduced. Example 4 When the procedure of Example 2 is again followed except that the prepolymer is prepared from polytetramethylene ether glycol of 3500 m.w. instead of polyethylene adipate, similar curing is achieved. Example 5 The procedure of Example 3 is again followed except that the polyethylene adipate is replaced by polythiodiethanol m.w. 2300 . Similar results are observed. Example 6 Example 3 is again followed in all essential details except that the amount of monomeric TDI added is 3.0 .Again an effective cure is accomplished with good hot and cold hardness and reduced compression set. Examples 7 10 The procedure of Example 2 is again followed ex cept that the stripped prepolymer contains 0.19 monomeric, uncombined TDI. The prepolymer was admixed with sufficient monomeric 2, 6 tolylene diisocyanate, 2, 4 tolylene diisocyanate or mixtures of 2,6 and 2,4 tolylene diisocyanate to provide a total NC0 content of 3.17 . The monomeric, uncombined TDI was 1.01 . The curative was mixed with the resultant prepolymer at 900C. and cured in a mold at 900C. As above, the pot life is the time following mixing before the mixture reaches a viscosity too high to permit pouring into a mold gel time is the time at which the mixture attains a firm, non tacky feel to the touch. Demold time is the time at which the elastomer can be removed from the mold without breaking, cracking or deforming. Data is set forth in the table below.

Thus, gel time and demold time are significantly reduced while still maintaining adequate pot life working time . Hardness is higher, modulus is increased, compression set is reduced, and compression modulus is increased. Demold time, hardness, and modulus improvements are considered important.
