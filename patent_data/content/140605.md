# LIFTING LUG FOR SHIPPING CONTAINERS

## Abstract
A lifting lug for shipping containers includes an elon gated bar having a fitting at one end for receiving the free end of a choker cable and an angularly oriented locking keeper member at an opposite end. The keeper member is rigidly affixed to the bar such that the bar must be pivoted to a particular angular orientation to allow insertion of the keeper member through an appropriate slot in a standard shipping container. Then the bar is pivoted to another angular orientation to lock the keeper member in position behind the slot. This angular orientation is such that tension of the choker cables will maintain the bar in the locked position. The locked orientation of the bar is thereby as sured to long as tension is maintained along the choker cables. An indicator is provided on an outside surface of the bar to show the operator the present angular orientation of the keeper member within the cargo container lift fitting.
