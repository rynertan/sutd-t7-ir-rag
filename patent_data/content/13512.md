# Methods for preparing a carboxyalkylated chitin and a de acetylated derivative thereof.

## Abstract
A method of preparing a water soluble carboxylakylated chitin comprises i freezing a highly concentrated aqueous alkali solution which contains chitin and ii dispersing the frozen mixture obtained from step i in an organic solvent containing an etherifying agent of formula X CHâ‚‚ The carboxyalkylated chitin may be deacetylated by treat ing it with an aqueous alkali. The carboxyalkylated and de acetylated carboxyalkylated chitin derivatives can be used in techniques of ion exchange.
