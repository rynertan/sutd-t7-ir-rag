# Shield arangement for a control lever of a vehicle sliding door lock.

## Abstract
A lever for controlling a lock of an automobile door is mounted on the door and projects from the door. A shield is fixed to the door, and lies parallel to and inward of the lever so that the lever lies behind the shield as seen from the automobile passenger compartment. The shield extends forward of the free end of the lever to prevent access to the control lever when the door is in its closed position.
