# Improvements in drainage blocks.

## Abstract
A concrete drainage component has a lightweight block 10 with a channel 12 accessible through a continuous slot 14 whereby the block 10 can be end pressed. A plurality of tops 30 seat across the top of the block 10 and each top 30 has a recess 34 in each side. When adjacent tops 30 abut a transverse slot is formed through which drainage can take place into the channel 12 . The tops 30 can also be pressed and therefore the component can be simply and economically produced.

## Description
Improvemonts in Drainage Blocks This invention is concerned with improvements in or reloting to the manufocture of concrete or similar products and is parts ularly related to the manufacture of drainage blocks. A conventional form of drainage block has a substantially rectangular cross section with a channel extending longitudinally therethrough, the channel being open onto an upper face of the block through a line of slots extending longitudinally of the block. Such slots are susceptible to the accumulation of dirt etc., and also, because of the provision of the slots, it is necessary to cost the block, resulting in the production of a large and heavy structure for reasons of economy. According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a drainage member having a drainage channel extending therethrough and opening onto one face of a base, means at said one face of the base for seating a plurality of cover parts across the channel opening, each of the cover parts being provided with at least one recess whereby to form a through slot for communicating with the channel when a pair of soid cover parts are seated on the base and abut one another0 Preferably the cover parts are freely seated on the base.The recess may be formed in a side of each cover part to form a slot extending loterally of the drainage channel. Preferobly also one of the recesses is forked in each side of each cover part whereby the recesses of adjacent cover parts face one another to form the respective slot. According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a drainage component comprising o drainage channel extending therethrough and opening onto one face thereof, means at said one face for seating a further component across the channel opening, the component being formed of a pressed cementitious material whereby to define a relatively lightweight structure. Enbodiments of the present invention will now be described by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is an end elevation of a drainage member according to one embodiment of the invention Fig. 2 is a perspective view of the drainage ember of Fig. 1 Fig. 3 is a section on A A of Fig. 1 Fig. 4 is a perspective view of a further embodiment of the invention Fig. 5 is a port view showing an alternative to the Fig. 4 embodiment andFig. 6 is a further part view showing a further alternative to theFig. 4 embodiment. Referring to Figs. 1 to 3 of the drawings, a concrete drainage block 10 has a drainage channel 12 of part circulor cross section extending longitudinally therethrough and opening through a wide, straight sided continuous longitudinal slot 14 onto an upper face 16 of the block 10. The upper face 16 is parallel with a lower face 18, the latter having a greater lateral dimension to give stability to the block. The sides of the block 10 are each defined by an inwardly angled section 20 and a vertical section 22 for the purpose hereinafter described. On each side of the slot 14 there is provided a recess in the upper face 16 defining a seat 24 for the purpose hereinafter described. As the slot 14 is unrestricted, the block 10 con be end pressed by a semi dry process or a conventional wet process and can therefore be produced economically to be of a smaller size than conventional blocks, thus defining a relatively lightweight structure which can be more easily handled and transported. A longitudinal through opening 26 is provided in the block 10 towards each.lower corner thereof so as to further reduce the weight of the block. On one end face of the block 10 there is formed a part circular groove 28 around the respective end opening of the channel 12 and a seoling naterial con be located in the groove 28, whereby adjacent blocks 10 can be sealingly joined together around the aligned drainage channels 12. The block 10 is adapted to seat a plurality of covers or tops 30 across the slot 14. Each of the tops 30 has a transverse dimension corresponding to the transverse dimension of the block 10 at the vertical sections 22 but hos, on its lower foce, an inwardly turned shoulder defining a downwardly extending part 32, the ends of which locate in the seats 24 of the block 10 to position the top 30 thereon. Four of the tops 30 can be located side by side along the length of the block 10 in abutment with one another. Each of the tops 30 has a recess 34 Fig. 3 in each side and positioned centrally of the respective side. Each recess 34 hos a maximum transverse dimension corresponding to the width of the slot 14, whereby to align vertically above the slot 14, and has side faces 36 inwardly angled towards one another, with the depth of the recess 34 increasing in a direction inwardly of the block 10. With reference to Fig. 3, the base of each recess 34, in a direction inwardly of the block 10, has a vertical section 38, an inwardly angled section 40, and a further verti cal section 42.When adjacent blocks abut one another the resp ective recesses 34 foce one another and effectively define a slot extending transversely of the channel 12 and flaring outwardly and downwardly so as to prevent blockage by dirt etc.Such a construction of the top 30 con be formed of pressed concrete and can be eosily and economically produced. When being positioned on site, the blocks 10 are laid end to end on a suitable base support which may extend up to the top of the angled section 20 of the side walls. The blocks 10 are secured to the support by grouting or the like and any suitable elements, such as interlocking blocks, can be laid against the vertical sections 22 of the side walls and the ends of the tops 30. It is to be appreciated that it is possible for the tops 30 to overlie the join between the adjacent blocks 10, as the tops 30 can be positioned as desired once the blocks 10 have been laid to form the continuous channel 12. In the embodiment of Fig. 4, the block 10 of suitable dimen sions locates, within the seats 24, a rectangular frame 44, pref erably formed of cast iron, which has a lower ledge 46 so as to seat therein a lid 48, again preferably of cast iron. Such a construction forms an inspection unit. With such a unit, a groove 50 is formed along the internal edge of each seat 24 and is filled with epoxy resin to secure the frame 44 in position. A suitably dimensioned block 10 may be utilised to locate other components in the seats 24. For example there may be located a pressed steel grate 52 Fig. 5 provided with trows verse slots, or a cast iron grote 54 Fig. 6 again provided with transverse slots. Each of the grates 52 or 54 is secured to the block 10 by the use of a threaded connecting member 56 passing through either a slot in the grate 52 or seated in a recess in the grate 54, and engaging in an internally threaded hole provided in a clamp 58 which can be positioned longitudinally in the channel 12 but is so dimensioned that when moved through 900 it cannot be removed through the slot 14 in the block 10. It is preferred, as shown in the drawings, that the upper edges of the block 10 ond the tops 30 are chamfered and it is also envisaged that the tops 30 moy be provided with a wire reinforcement, The ability to provide a cover formed of the tops 30 is advantageous in that pressed concrete can be used, without resulting in an unwieldy structure, so as to match the material of the blocks 10 and enable consistency in colour. The structure in use is also fully interlocking. Various modifications may be made without departing from the invention. For exanple, the sides of the block 10 may have a configuration other than that shown and a sealing groove may be formed in each end of the block. Also the configuration of the recesses 34 may be altered from thot shown.
