# A PROCESS AND MEANS FOR THE CONTINUOUS AND AUTOMATIC ENVELOPING OF ELECTRIC BATTERY PLATES

## Abstract
A continuous, automatic process for enveloping electric battery plates free from environmental risks is proposed. The process is carried out by a device comprising a supply device B for feeding a longitudinally heat shrinkable strip 2 consisting of a series of adjacent and parallel envelopes open at least on one sind a device M for supplying plates 3 to be enveloped an enveloping device 6 comprising a means for enlarging the opening of each envelope and a means 5 for inserting the plate 3 into the envelope a heating process E a device F for hot cutting the continuous strip and a point G for storing the enveloped plates 6 . A series of guide rollers 7 , 7 and 7 is provided for feeding the continuous strip through the various processes.
