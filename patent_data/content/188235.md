## Description
The present invention relates to an improved method for converting organoboranes containing a partially optically active organyl group attached to boron, and more specifically relates to methods for obtaining organoboranes containing an essentially optically pure organyl group. Asymmetric hydroboration of alkenes, with diisopinocampheylborane or in many cases also with monoisopinocampheylborane typically provides the corresponding chiral organoborane containing the new alkyl group, R , in from 50 to 90 enantiomeric excess ee , and occasionally in purities of from 90 to 100 ee. Because of the importance of hydroboration to, for example, the pharmaceutical industry, there has been a long standing need for a simple, reliable process which provides the alkyl group, R The first successful asymmetric synthesis occured in 1961 with the hydroboration of The chiral intermediate, 2 butyldiisopinocampheylborane, was subsequently converted into optically active 2 aminobutane with complete retention of configuration and into 2 iodobutane with complete inversion of configuration. Verbit, L. et al, JOC In the original study of hydroborations with optically active diisopinocampheylborane, the reagent employed was prepared from commercial α pinene of relatively low enantiomeric purity 93 . Subsequent advances resulted in the preparation of reagent of high enantiomeric purity from such α pinene. The reagent is equilibrated at 0 C with 15 excess α pinene. The major isomer becomes incorporated into the crystalline reagent, leaving the minor isomer in solution. Brown, H.C. et al, Israel J. Chem. Improved asymmetric results were achieved in the hydroboration of It has been found that while diisopinocampheylborane Ipc₂ BH handles It is difficult to halt the hydroboration of α pinene at the monoalkylborane stage. Consequently, it was found that the monoisopinocampheylborane must be prepared by an indirect route, such as by treating diisopinocampheylborane with one half molar equivalent of Monoisopinocampheylborane has been found to be very effective for the asymmetric hydroboration of For reasons that are not understood, the asymmetric hydroboration of the phenyl derivatives provides considerably improved hydroboration products of, for example 82 ee, 85 ee, 100 ee and 88 ee FIG. 11 as compared to the 53 ee, 62 ee, 66 ee and 72 ee respectively for the corresponding parent compounds FIG. 10 , see Mandal, A.K. et al, Joc Monoisopinocampheylborane and diisopinocampheylborane are complementary to each other, and are capable of handling three of the four major classes of alkenes. Diisopinocampheylborane, a reagent with larger steric requirements, is more suited for use in the case of unhindered Initially, the application of chiral organoboranes was limited primarily to alcohols because of the presence of isopinocampheyl groups on boron in the product. Recently, it was discovered that these groups can be selectively eliminated by treatment of the mixed chiral organoboranes with acetaldehyde, regenerating the α pinene, and providing the optically active boronate as the product. In this way, for example, 2 butyldiisopinocampheylborane is readily converted into diethyl 2 butylboranate in 97 ee. Brown, H.C. et al, JACS, Similarly, diethyl Hydroboration of prochiral alkenes with diisopinocampheylborane and monoisopinocampheylborane typically results in products in which approximately 60 to 90 optical activity is generally induced in the R The usual organic synthesis of enantiomers produces a 50 50 mixture of the two optical isomers. Normally, these are separated by combining them with a naturally occurring optically active acid or base chiral auxiliary to form a pair of diastereoisomers. Laborious fractional crystallization then separates the two diastereoisomers. The chiral auxiliary is then removed to regenerate the desired optically active compound. However, it is not always possible to resolve optical mixtures once the final products have been obtained without destroying the molecule, and there has been a longstanding need for a reliable method of resolving the mixture at a stage to obtain an optically pure intermediate which can then be converted to any number of final products while retaining its optical configuration. J.Am.Chem.Soc., vol. 6, no.6, 1984, pages 1797 1800 describe my work which resulted in a procedure of achieving products of essentially 100 optical purity in hydroboration of alkenes with monoisopinocampheylborane when the organoborane formed is solid. Earlier work with monoisopinocampheylborane was reported in J.Org.Chem., vol .45, no.17, 1980, pages 3543 3544. It has now been discovered that optically pure organoborane intermediates can be reliably and readily obtained from The present invention provides methods for preparing optically pure organoboranes, containing the chiral group R These optically pure organoboranes are then readily converted into essentially any class of organic compounds, making possible the synthesis of a large number of monochiral organic compounds in an optical purity of essentially 100 ee. The invention will be more readily understood by the following description, taken in conjuction with the drawings in which The present invention provides a simple, direct and economical method of producing an optically pure boron intermediate which can be converted to virtually any optically active compound having a chiral center, either In one aspect, the process of this invention comprises the producing in essentially 100 enantiomeric excess ee an optically pure organoborane comprising the steps of reacting a In cases where the organoborane resulting from the reaction of a prochiral alkene and the optically active hydroborating agent is a solid, simple recrystallization of the reaction product, with, for example, a hydrocarbon such as pentane or ether, results in the desired organoborane intermediate of essentially 100 enantiomeric excess. In cases where the organoborane is a liquid, a solid derivative is prepared by forming either a crystalline borate, a borane complex or a chelate. In another aspect of this invention, in which the organoborane is a liquid, the process of this invention comprises the producing in essentially 100 enantiomeric excess an optically pure organoborane comprising the steps of reacting a Crystalline borates are conveniently obtained by treating the liquid organoborane, Ipc₂BR Crystalline borane complexes are readily prepared by reacting the liquid organoborane with an amine of low steric requirements such as ammonia, methylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, pyrrolidine, piperidine, and the like, according to the following reactions schemes Solid chelate derivatives are prepared by reacting the liquid organoborane with an aldehyde to form the borinic acid ester, followed by a suitable chelating agent such as ethanolamine, The term suitable aminoethanol chelating agent refers to compounds represented by the formula RNHCH₂CH₂OH where R consists of hydrogen, C₁ to C₆ straight or branched chain alkyl and C₃ and C₆ cycloalkyl and benzyl. Alternatively, the liquid hydroboration products, Ipc₂BR can be enriched by selective treatment with an appropriate reagent which preferentially destroys one isomer, permitting an enrichment in the less reactive isomer. This procedure takes advantage of the fact that such compounds contain three different optically active groups. They will therefore exist of at least two different diastereomers with different reactivities. The enrichment with aldehydes, preferably benzaldehyde, is valuable for such enrichments which proceed according to the following general reaction scheme. Enrichment may also be achieved by carrying out the displacement to produce a mixture of borinic and boronic esters which are readily separated by selective extraction with alkali. The borinic acid is isolated, converted to the methyl ester or trimethylene glycol ester, for example, or oxidized to the alcohol. In cases where the reaction product of an alkene with diisopinocampheylborane is a solid, direct crystallization by treatment with a suitable solvent, preferably a hydrocarbon such as n pentane, iso pentane, or hexane, or an ether such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran or dimethoxyethane, result in the desired crystalline intermediate having an enantiomeric purity in excess of 98 ee. In cases where the reaction product of an alkene with either monoisopinocampheylborane or diisopinocampheylborane is a liquid, e.g. an oil, it is first necessary to convert the reaction product to a solid as described above. The solid borate, borane complex or chelate is then recrystallized by treatment with a suitable solvent to obtain the desired borane intermediate of 98 or greater ee. As used herein, the term essentially 100 enantiomeric excess means an enantiomeric excess of at least 98 of one of the members of an enantiomeric pair. The term ee is an abbreviation for enantiomeric excess . The term enantiomeric pair refers to a pair of substances whose molecules are nonidentical mirror images. The term hydrocarbon as used herein in referring to a suitable solvent refers to C₃ to C₈ straight or branched chain or cyclic hydrocarbons, i.e. pentane, hexane, cyclooctane, isobutane and the like, and aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene or toluene. The term alkali metal includes sodium, lithium and potassium. The term ether refers to dialkyloxides including cyclic derivatives such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and dimethoxyethane. The term R The term chiral , as used herein, refers to compounds which lack reflection symmetry, i.e., are not identical with their mirror images. The term alkene refers to acyclic and cyclic alkenes having up to 30 carbon atoms. The term alkyl refers to substituted and unsubstituted, cyclic and acylic alkyl groups having up to 30 carbon atoms. In the case of acyclic alkyl, the alkyl groups may be straight or branched chain. Generally speaking, recrystallization of the solid borane intermediate, obtained either directly from reacting a Suitable cooling baths for recrystallization include, for example, pentane slush, dry ice and acetone, dry ice and alcohol, and the like. The process of this invention resolves at a stage where the resulting optically pure intermediate can be employed to prepare a wide variety of final products having the optical configuration of the optically pure intermediate as shown in the following general reaction scheme wherein R is an optically pure acylic or cyclic, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group.
