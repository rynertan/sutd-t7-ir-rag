A container according to either claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the heat sink 8 comprises degraded collagen matrix containing thermal and chemical stabilizers. 4. A container according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the heat sink 8 is surrounded by heat insulating foam 7 . 5. A container according to any one of the preceding claims, of a size suitable for carrying on or about the person, for carrying a small supply of pharmaceutical preparations which are susceptible to degradation by heat or light. 6. A pharmaceutical pack comprising a container according to any one of claims 1 to 4, and containing a supply of tablets, capsules, suppositories, ampoules, or ophthalmic solutions which are susceptible to degradation by heat or light1 to be carried in the pocket or handbag of the patient. 7. A container according to any one of claims 1 to 4, adapted to carry or store any objects, materials or chemicals which are susceptible to degradation by heat or light. 8. A container according to any one of claims 1 to 4, adapted to carry or store photographic films or photographic chemicals.

## Description
Environmental1s Controlled Medication Container This invention is directed to a container for protecting pharmaceutical preparations or other chemicals and materials from degradation by ambient conditions of temperature and environment. Many materials, and notably a large range of important pharmaceutical preparations, are subject to accelerated degradation by temperature and other environmental conditions. In particular, a number of commonly prescribed medications are temperature and light unstable. The best known is glyceryltrinitrate.Others include benzodiazepines, prochlorperazine, penicillin, pseudoephedrine, promethazine, prednisolone and captopril. The manufacturers of glyceryltrinitrate recommend that the tablets be stored at temperatures of less than 250C and protected from light. The standard brown glass bottle falls far short of these criteria for example these types of containers reach an internal 0 temperature of 25 C within 20 minutes of removal from a refrigerator, and the temperature of tablets carried in 0 a shirt or trouser pocket rapidly reaches 35 cho There have been two previous attempts to provide an insulated container for heat sensitive materials. Southwick U.S. 3,472,568 1969 describes a fibre container having an inner insulating layer with a removable inner receptacle, the insulating layer being surrounded by a hard exterior shell with detachable top.The novel feature of this invention was a humidity control device. This invention was not directed specifically at protection of pharmaceuticals. Lowe U.S. 4,054,208 1977 describes a container for medicinal tablets, capsules or pills, to be carried on the person, consisting of two concentric cylindrical tubes, the inner tube being of translucent amber coloured plastic or glass, separated from an outer transparent tube by an air space. This invention was intended to protect pharmaceutical products from body heat, light, and moisture, as well as from mechanical damage. No insulation or heat protective device other than the airspace was incorporated into the invention. In a general aspect the invention provides a container having an outer case, and an inner chamber, which may for example be cylindrical and suitable for holding a small number of tablets. The cavity between the chamber and the case contains thermal insulating material, including a heat sink, so that the contents of the chamber are protected from deleterious rise in temperature following a rise in temperature of the case, as will occur when the container is removed from a refrigerator and carried on the user s person. In a more particular aspect the invention provides a container having an outer case and an inner chamber, and thermal insulating means therebetween, characterized in that the thermal insulating means includes a heat sink whereby rise in temperature of the contents of the inner chamber following exposure of the outer casing to an increased temperature is delayed for a period sufficient to avoid deterioration of the contents of the chamber, under normal conditions of use. The outer case is preferably made of an opaque, rigid material. The heat sink, which may comprise degraded collagen matrix containing thermal and chemical stabilizers, is preferably surrounded by a reflecting and conductive shield. It may also be surrounded by heat insulating foam, for example expanded polystyrene. In a preferred embodiment, the container incorporates the use of an opaque, inert, rigid construction material to protect the contents of the container from mechanical damage and from degradation by light. The insulating means includes insulating layers of foam and of aluminium foil, which, with the use of a heat sink to surround the inner chamber, give excellent protection of the contents of the inner chamber from heat. An embodiment according to the invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawing, in which Figure 1 is a schematic representation of an embodiment of a container in accordance with the present invention and Figures 2 and 3 are sectional views through the container of Figure 1. The container shown in the drawing comprises an external case 1 of synthetic resinous material having a ridged, hinged lid 2 which carries a stopper 3 which registers with an inner chamber as shown in the form of a tube 4 to seal the said tube in an airtight manner.The container is internally insulated by a multi layer reflecting shield comprising aluminium foil layers 5 and 6, an expanded polystyrene layer 7, surrounding heat sink 8, containing degraded collagen matrix and agar having metabisulphite as chemical stabilizer. Heat sink 8 surrounds tube 4, which is made from a synthetic resin which does not absorb the vapour phase of the contained medication, e.g. polyethylene or polypropylene in the case of glyceryltrinitrate. This container will maintain an internal temperature of less than 250C for over 4 hours after removal from a refrigerator and returns to base temperature within 30 to 60 minutes when placed in a normal domestic refrigerator or freezer. The present container is not intended to replace the manufacturer s container. It is designed to ensure that prescribed medications remain stable whilst they are carried about the person. The following embodiments are within the scope of this invention 1. A reusable container adapted to carry a small supply of pharmaceutical preparations, such as tablets, capsules or suppositories, in the pocket or handbag of the user. 2. A reusable container adapted to carry ampoules or ophthalmic solutions in the pocket or handbag of the user. 3. A resuable container adapted to contain a medical practitioner s emergency supply of drugs, and which can be readily carried in his her bag during rounds and returned to cold storage on completion of the round. This would also be applicable to emergency supplies carried in an ambulance. 4. A reusable container adapted to carry heat sensitive or light sensitive materials other than pharmaceutical preparations, such as photographic films and photographic chemicals.
