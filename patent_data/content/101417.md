# A GRATER STRUCTURE FOR HOUSEHOLD APPLICATIONS

## Abstract
This invention relates to a grater structure for household applications, which is specially engineered to give full assurance of hygienic and safe conditions in any situations. This grater includes, in a manner known per se, a shaped plate 2 having a substantially rectangular outline and being perforated with a plurality of throuhgoing holes 3 . The shaped plate 2 has a working face 2a wherefrom preferably frusto conical and jagged annular protuberances 4 stand out and border through going holes 3 . Between annular protuberances 4 , the shaped plate 2 has substantially smooth lands even at its working face 2a . In a manner known per se, a means of positioning and supporting the shaped plate 2 is provided which comprises, in this specific case, a frame 5 pivoted, through pins 6 , to the shaped plate 2 and a handle 7 formed at the top end of the plate 2 . The pins 6 are located adjacent the handle 7 to allow the grater to be placed in a tilted attitude with the handle raised. The shaped plate 2 is associated with a smooth plate 8 having an edge outline which is similar to that of the cited shaped plate.
