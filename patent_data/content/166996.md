## Description
This invention relates to a method for stabilizing a physiologically active substance produced by recombinant DNA technique, and more particularly to a method for stabilizing a physiologically active substance, which comprises adding an albumin to an aqueous solution or powder containing a physiologically active substance which is prepared by recombinant DNA technique and has an antitumor activity. This invention also relates to a stable aqueous solution or powder which contains the physiologically active substance and an effective amount of an albumin. It is known that there is a physiologically active substance which is derived from human and which has cytotoxic activity against L M cells and is capable of inducing hemorrhagic necrosis of a transplanted tumor, Meth A sarcoma, in the BALB c mouse. Such a physiologically active substance has an anti tumor activity and is called human TumorNecrosis Factor hereinafter often referred to as human TNF . It is also known that such a physiologically active substance has no toxic effect upon normal cells in vitro. Further, since the physiologically active substance is derived from human, there is no danger that anaphylactic shock might be caused due to the administration of a substance to a human which is not the origin of the substance.Therefore, expectations for the clinical application of the above mentioned physiologically active substance as an antitumor medicine have been great in the art. In order to ensure the wide and safe clinical application of human TNF as an antitumor medicine, it is required to obtain human TNF in highly purified form. Previously, there has been proposed a method for obtaining human TNF by recombinant DNA technique.According to the proposed method, the desired humanTNF can be produced in substantially pure form on a large scale. The proposed method consists in ligating a deoxyribonucleic acid coding for human TNF to a replicable expression vehicle to obtain a replicable recombinant DNA comprising said deoxyribonucleic acid and said replicable expression vehicle tranforming cells of a microorganism or cell culture with said replicable recombinant DNA to form transformants selecting said transformants from parent cells of the microorganism or cell culture incubating said transformants, causing said transformants to express said deoxyribonucleic acid and produce human TNF and isolating said human TNF from the incubated transformants, followed by purification. As stated above, according to the proposed method using recombinant DNA technique, there can advantageously be obtained the desired human TNF in substantially pure form on a large scale. However, when large scale production of human TNF to be used as an antitumor medicine is performed, it is usually needed to store the substantially pure human TNF in the form of a solution or a frozen mass over a prolonged period of time and lyophilize the active substance solution.However, the present inventors have fround that the activity of substantially pure human TNF markedly drops on storing, freezing, thawing and lyophilizing it.Further, it is noted that during the storage of the substantially pure TNF produced by recombinant DNA technique until the TNF is actually administered to a patient suffering from cancer, the activity of the TNF also drops markedly. With respect to the stabilization of proteins having antitumor activity, there are publications such as USP 4,447,355 and Japanese atent Application Laid Open Specifications Nos. 59 39829 1984 and 59 59625 1984 . However, as far as the present inventors are aware, there has been no report in which the stability of substantially pure human TNF produced by recombinant DNA technique is studied. Under these circumstances, the efficient and steady supply of the substantially pure human TNF, especially on a commercial scale cannot be ensured, despite the knowledge that the human TNF is an effective antitumor medicine. To overcome the above elucidated difficulty with respect to the stability of the physiologically active substance, the present inventors have made extensive and intensive studies. As a result, it has been found, quite surprisingly, that addition of an effective amount of an albumin as a stabilizing agent to an aqueous solution or powder containing the physiologically active substance enables the substance to be stored over a prolonged period of time without losing its activity and renders the substance stable during the procedures of isolation and purification and on freezing, thawing, lyophilization or the like.Based on the novel finding, the present invention has been completed. It is, therefore, an object of the present invention tovprovide a method for stabilizing a physiologically active substance produced by recombinant DNA technique. It is another object of the present invention to provide a stable aqueous solution or powder of a physiologically active substance which maintains its activity over a prolonged period of time and which is stable on freezing, thawing, lyophilization or the like. The foregoing and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description and appended claims taken in connection with the accompanying drawings in which Fig. 1 illustrates the restriction maps of plasmid inserts each containing a DNA coding for a conventional rabbit physiologically active polypeptide Fig. 2 illustrates the flow sheet of the method for the preparation of a recombinant DNA pTNF lac l coding for the conventional rabbit physiologically active polypeptide Fig. 3 illustrates the flow sheet of the method for the preparation of another recombinant DNA pTNF lacUV5 l coding for the conventional rabbit physiologically active polypeptide Fig. 4 illustrates the restriction map of the portion of a plasmid containing a gene for a physiologically active substance to be used in the present invention Fig. 5 illustrates the restriction map of the portion of a plasmid containing a gene for a conventional rabbit TNF Fig. 6 illustrates the flow sheet of the method for the preparation of a recombinant DNA pHTNF lacUV5 l coding for a physiologically active substance to be used in the present invention Fig. 7 illustrates the flow sheet of the method for the preparation of another recombinant DNA pHTNF lacUV5 2 coding for the physiologically active substance to be used in the present invention and Fig. 8 illustrates the graph showing the effect of the concentration of human serum albumin on the reminaing activity of the physiologically active substance to be used in the present invention after storage at 4 OC for 7 days. In one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for stabilizing a physiologically active substance, which comprises adding to an aqueous solution or powder containing a physiologically active substance an effective amount of an albumin, said physiologically active substance being one which is produced by recombinant DNA technique using a recombinant DNA containing a DNA coding for the physiologically active substance, and which has cytotoxic activity agsinst L M cells and is capable of inducing hemorrhagic necrosis of transplantedMeth A sarcoma in the BALB c mouse. In another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a stable aqueous solution or powder containing a physiologically active substance and an effective amount of an albumin, said physiologically active substance being one which is produced by recombinant DNA technique using a recombinant DNA containing a DNA coding for the physiologically active substance, and which has cytotoxic activity against L M cells and is capable of inducing hemorrhagic necrosis of transplanted MethA sercoma in the BALC c mouse. As mentioned before, the physiologically active substance to be used in the present invention is one produced by a customary recombinant DNA technique using a recombinant DNA containing a DNA coding for the physiologically active substance. When the physiologically active substance is subjected to assays according to the methods as described later, the physiologically active substance exhibits cytotoxic activity against L M cells and induces hemorrhagic necrosis of transplanted Meth A sarcoma in theBALB c mouse.Specifically, the physiologically active substance is a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence represented by the following formula I Ser Ser Ser Arg Thr Pro Ser Asp Lys Pro Val Ala His Val ValAla Asn Pro Gln Ala Glu Gly Gln Leu Gln Trp Leu Asn Arg ArgAla Asn Ala Leu Leu Ala Asn Gly Val Glu Leu Arg Asp Asn GlnLeu Val Val Pro Ser Glu Gly Leu Tyr Leu Ile Tyr Ser Gln ValLeu Phe Lys Gly Gln Gly Cys Pro Ser Thr His Val Leu Leu ThrHis Thr Ile Ser Arg Ile Ala Val Ser Tyr Gln Thr Lys Val AsnLeu Leu Ser Ala Ile Lys Ser Pro Cys Gln Arg Glu Thr Pro GluGly Ala Glu Ala Lys Pro Trp Tyr Glu Pro Ile Tyr Leu Gly GlyVal Phe Gln Leu Glu Lys Gly Asp Arg Leu Ser Ala Glu lie AsnArg Pro Asp Tyr Leu Asp Phe Ala Glu Ser Gly Gln Val Tyr PheGly Ile Ile Ala Leu wherein Gln stands for a glutamine residue, Asp an aspartic acid residue, Pro a proline residue, Tyr a tyrosine residue, Val a valine residue, Lys a lysine residue, Glu a glutamic acid residue, Ala an alanine residue, Asn an asparagine residue, Leu a leucine residue, Phe a phenylalanine residue, Gly a glycine redidue, His a histidine residue, Ser a gerine residue, Thr a threonine residue,. Ile an isoleucine residue, Trp a tryptophan residue, Arg an arginine residue. Met a methionine residue, and Cys a cysteine residue. The physiologically active substance having the above mentioned amino acid sequence may be produced by a customary recombinant DNA technique using a recombinant DNA which contains a DNA coding for the physiologically active substance comprising at least one base sequence selected from the group consisting of a base sequence represented by the following formula II and a complementary base sequence to said base sequence TCA TCT TCT CGA ACC CCG AGT GAC AAG CCT GTA GCC CAT GTT GTAGCA AAC CCT CAA GCT GAG GGG CAG CTC CAG TGG CTG AAC CGC CGGGCC AAT GCC CTC CTG GCC AAT GGC GTG GAG CTG AGA GAT AAC CAGCTG GTG GTG CCA TCA GAG GGC CTG TAC CTC ATC TAC TCC CAG GTCCTC TTC AAG GGC CAA GGC TGC CCC TCC ACC CAT GTG CTC CTC ACCCAC ACC ATC AGC CGC ATC GCC GTC TCC TAC CAG ACC AAG GTC AACCTC CTC TCT GCC ATC AAG AGC CCC TGC CAG AGG GAG ACC CCA GAGGGG GCT GAG GCC AAG CCC TGG TAT GAG CCC ATC TAT CTG GGA GGGGTC TTC CAG CTG GAG AAG GGT GAC CGA CTC AGC GCT GAG ATC AATCGG CCC GAC TAT CTC GAC TTT GCC GAG TCT GGG CAG GTC TAC TTTGGG ATC ATT GCC CTG wherein A stands for a deoxyadenylic acid residue, G a deoxyguanylic acid residue, C a deoxycytidylic acid residue and T thymidylic acid residue and wherein the left end and right end of the formula II represent 5 hydroxyl group side and 3 hydroxyl group side, respectively. The above mentioned physiologically active substance and the above mentioned DNA may be obtained as follows 1. A bacteriophage rabbit genomic library and a bacteriophage human genomic library prepared by Prof. T. Maniatis, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Harvard University, 7 Divinity Avenue, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138, U.S.A. are used. These materials may be prepared according to the following procedures see Cell, 15, p.687 1978 1 rabbit or human tissues, for example rabbit or human pancreas tissue, are reduced to frozen powder and treated to digest RNA and protein materials and provide, on precipitation, high molecular weight rabbit or human DNA 2 the high molecular weight DNA is partially digested for random cutting with respect to gene locus 3 the resultant DNA fragments are size fractionated giving from 15 to 20 kilo base pair kb fragments 4 the resultant fragments of Step 3 are cloned using a X Charon 4A phage vector and 5 the resultant vectors are packaged in vitro to infectious phage particles containing rDNA to obtain the above mentioned rabbit or human genomic library.2. The rabbit TNF cDNA obtained in Referential Example 1 is 32P labelled by P.W.J. Rigby et al s nick translation method see J. Mol. Biol. 113, p.237 . 1977 1. 3. Each of the bacteriophage Rabbit genomic library and bacteriophage A human genomic library is plated to virtual confluence on a lawn of bacteria and screened for hybridization with the 32P labelled rabbit TNF cDNA.4. From the appropriate clones, the corresponding DNA is isolated, restriction mapped and analyzed by Southern hybridization see E.M. Southern, J. Mol. Biol., 98, p.503 1975 . Restriction fragments containing rabbit or human TNF genes are subcloned into plasmid vectors and then sequenced.5. The base sequence of the rabbit TNF cDNA is compared with that of the rabbit TNF gene to determine the exons certain sequences of bases which code for the amino acid sequence of rabbit TNF and introns certain sequences of bases which do not code for the amino acid sequence of rabbit TNF of the rabbit TNF gene.6. Thereafter, the base sequence of the human TNF gene is compared with that of the rabbit TNF gene to determine the exons and introns of the human TNF gene. 7. The amino acid sequence of rabbit TNF that has been deduced from the base sequence obtained by deleting the introns of the rabbit TNF gene and combining the exons thereof is affirmed to be in agreement with that deduced from the base sequence of the rabbit TNF cDNA.8. Next, the amino acid sequence of the physiologi cally active substance to be used in the present invention is deduced from the base sequence of the DNA coding for the physiologically active substance obtained by deleting the introns of the gene coding for the physiologically active substance and combining the exons thereof. The amino acid sequence of the physiologically active substance is affirmed to be partially in agreement with that of the rabbit TNF.9. Then, the DNA coding for the physiologically active substance is tailored in vitro for inser tion into an appropriate expression vehicle to form recombinant DNA containing the coding DNA. The recombinant DNA is used to transform an appropriate host cell which is, in turn, permitted to grow in a culture and to express the desired physiologically active substance.10. The physiologically active substance thus produced has 155 amino acid residues in its mature form, beginning with serine. When it has a signal peptide in its presequence, the signal peptide is very hydrophobic in character. The foregoing discloses the procedures for obtaining the gene coding for the physiologically active substance, the base sequence of the DNA coding for the physiologically active substance and the process for producing the physiologically active substance by the use of the DNA. However, it should be understood that the foregoing disclosure is not intended to limit the method and that obvious changes may be made by those skilled in the art. Due to the variable use frequency of a codon genetic code corresponding to each amino acid and for other reasons, a partial or entire portion of the base sequence of the DNA coding for the physiologically active substance may be substituted by an organochemically synthesized artificial DNA without causing the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide obtained therefrom to be changed. Presumably, the physiologically active substance may be intracellularly produced in immature form as a prepeptide or prepropeptide, which may be processed via an intermediate form to a mature physiologically active substance in the processing stage. The immature form of the physiologically active substance may be deduced from the base sequence of the humanTNF gene. The DNA comprising a DNA encoding the physiologically active substance in immature or intermediate form may also be recombined with a natural or artificially synthesized DNA. One application of this technique may be attained by inserting the methionine codon ATG in the 5 end and inserting at least one stop codon selected fromTAA, TAG and TGA in the 3 end of the mature or intermediate or immature TNF DNA. Due to the pressence of the methionine coden, the mature or intermediate or immature physiologically active substance may be produced on the mRNA synthesized with the aid of an appropriate promotor. However, the methionine residue attached to the N terminus of the physiologically active substance is cleaved or not cleaved according to the kind of the host cell employed. The purpose of inserting the stop codon is to stop translation of the mRNA transcripted from the DNA coding for the physiologically active substance at an appropriate position C terminus of polypeptide of the formula I . Another application of this technique may be attained by adding to the DNA a highly hydrophobic base sequence known as a signal sequence . By this addition, it may become feasible to secrete the physiologically active substance to outside the host cell or, in the case of a gram negative bacterium, into the space known as periplasm . When a vector in which a start codon is incorporated is employed, a fused peptide may be produced which consists of the physiologically active substance and a peptide attributed to the vector. In this case, the fused peptide may be cleaved chemically or enzymatically. Alternatively, the fused peptide, if the main activity of the physiologically active substance is not adversely affected, may be used as it is. The DNA coding for the physiologically active substance may be connected, at its region upstream of the 5 end, to the gene sequence of a promoter thereby to obtain a TNF DNA promoter sequence which does not hinder its replication and does not cause translation of the resultant RNA to be adversely affected. The thus obtainedTNF DNA promoter sequence may be combined with a vector which is replicable in a bacterium or higher organism cell to obtain a recombinant DNA. The thus obtained recombinant DNA may be used to transform a bacterium or higher organism cell used as a host. The thus obtained transformant may be cultured to effect expresseion of the DNA coding for the physiologically active substance in order to produce the physiologically active substance. When Escherichia coli is used as the abovementioned host1 there may be mentioned, as the suitable host, various mutant strains of E. coli K 12, such asHB101 ATCC 33694 , C600X ATCC33955 , D1210 RRI ATCC31343 , MC1061, LE392 ATCC33572 , JM101 ATCC33876 , Job3, and X1776 ATCC31244 . When the E. coli host is employed, there may be mentioned, as the suitable vector, plasmids such as pBR322, pBR325, pBR327, pUC3, pUC9, pM39 ATCC37019 , pJB8 ATCC37074 and pKC7 ATCC37084 , A phages such as Agt, AB and Charon 4A, and M13 phage. To have the active substance produced in the E. coli cell, a promoter selected from the promoters of the E. coli and phage genes may be employed. Examples of the suitable promoter include the genes for lactose degradation enzyme LAC , UV5 mutant thereof, penicillinase BLA and tryptophan synthetase TRP , A phage Pi, promoter and tac promoter which is a fused promoter of tryptophan synthetase and lactose degradation enzyme. When Bacillus subtilis is used as the host, there may be mentioned, as the suitable host, BD170 strain ATCC33608 , BR151 strain ATCC33677 and MI112 strain ATCC33712 . When the Bacillus subtilis host is employed, there may be mentioned, as the suitable vector, plasmids pC194 ATCC37034 , pUB110 ATCC37015 , pSA2100 ATCC37014 and pE194. Further, when theBacillus subtilis host is employed, there may be mentioned, as the suitable promoter, the genes for chloramphenicol acetylation enzyme CAT , penicillinase and anti erythromycin. When a yeast is used as the host, there may be mentioned, as the suitable host, strains ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae such as RH218 ATCC44076 ,SHY1 ATCC44769 , SHY3 ATCC44771 , D131A, 483 and 830. When the yeast host is employed, there may be mentioned, as the suitable vector, plasmids such asYEpl3 ATCC37115 , YEp6, YRp7 and YIp5. Further, when the yeast host is employed, there may be mentioned, as the suitable promoter, the genes for acid phosphatase, alcohol dehydrogenase ADHf , tryptophan synthetase TRP , phosphoglycerate kinase PGK , cytochrome B COB and actin. The thus prepared transformant is cultured on a large scale according to a customary method to produce the desired physiologically active substance.Then, the supernatant of the culture or a cell extract is collected to obtain a crude physiologically active substance. The crude physiologically active substance produced by any of the methods as set forth above may be purified using the below cited conventional biochemical techniques singly or in combination to give an aqueous purified physiologically active substance solution, which is lyophilized to give a purified physiologically active substance powder.As the suitable biochemical technique for purification of the active substance, there can be mentioned, for example, a salting out technique in which ammonium sulfate is employed, an ion exchange chromatography in which an anion exchange resin is employed, a gel filtration technique and an electrophoresis technique.As the purity of the active substance is increased by practicing the above techniques for purification, it is recognized that the active substance gradually becomes instable. For example, a sample of the physiologically active substance so purified as to have a specific activity of 500,000 units mg the specific activity is expressed as units of activity per mg of protein the unit of activity is defined later is quite instable as seen from the data given in the Examples. Even the samples having a specific activity lower than 500,000 units mg also experience a decrease of the respective activity in some degree when they are in storage or subjected to freezing, thawing, lyophilization and other operations. Accordingly, the present invention is directed to the stabilization of the physiologically active substance that has been purified to a high degree and has been rendered instable. The active substance to be stabilized according to the present invention may be either in the form of a solution or powder.However, it is preferred that the active substance to be stabilized be in the form of a solution. It is preferred that the solution of the physiologically active substance to be stabilized according to the present invention constantly have a pH value of from 5 to 10, and further, it is preferred that the solvent for the solution to be stabilized be a suitable buffer. As the suitable buffer, there can be mentioned, for example, a phosphate buffer and a tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane HCl buffer. According to need, a salt, such as sodium chloride and potassium chloride, is added to the solution. For example, a salt is added to the solution so as to prepare an isotonic solution, when the solution is used for injection. The purpose of addition of a salt is not limited to the above. The concentration of such a salt in the solution, may be determined, depending on the purpose of addition of the salt.For example, when the ultimate TNF solution is used for injection, an isotonic solution is prepared from the solution by addition of sodium chloride up to a concentration of 0.15M. According to the method of the present invention, an effective amount of an albumin is added to an aqueous solution or powder containing the physiologically active substance. As the suitable albumin, there can be mentioned human albumin and bovine albumin. There may also be mentioned albumins from various animals, such as horse, sheep, goat and chicken. As specific examples of the suitable albumin, there can be mentioned bovine serum albumin, human serum albumin, bovine lactalbumin, human lactalbumin and albumin derived from human placenta.No significant difference is observed, in respect of the ability to stabilize the active substance, between the above mentioned albumins. As the stabilizing agent for injection preparations, however, human serum albumin is most preferable. The above mentioned albumins may be purified according to customary methods before use. The albumin to be employed in the present invention is added to the solution in an amount of about 1 ug or more, preferably 10 pg or more, especially preferably 100 pg or more, per ml of the solution having a cytotoxic activity against L M cells of 102 9 to 10 units ml the unit of activity is defined later . The upper limit of the amount of the albumin is usually determined from the viewpoints of the solubility of the albumin and viscosity of the resulting solution and from the economical viewpoint. The upper limit of the amount of the albumin is generally 50 mg, preferably 10 mg, per ml of the TNF solution. When the active substance to be stabilized is in a powdery form, the albumin is added to the powder such an amount as will cause an aqueous solution, which is obtained by dissolving the powdery physiologically active substance to exhibit an activity of 102 to 109 units ml, to have the above mentioned concentrations of the albumin. The way in which the albumin is added is not critical. For example, the albumin in a powdery form may be directly added to the active substance solution.Alternatively, the powder of the albumin may be dissolved, in advance, in water or a suitable buffer, and added to the solution. Further, alternatively, the powder of the albumin may be mixed with the powder of the active substance. Addition of the albumin may be effected at any time during the purification step or the step of manufacturing pharmaceutical preparations. It is preferred that storing and purification of and manufacturing pharmaceutical preparations from the physiologically active substance solution in which an albumin to be employed according to the present invention is incorporated, if kept in the form of a solution, be performed at a temperature of from 0 to 300C, more preferably from 0 to 100C. When the solution is stored in a frozen form, it is preferred that the temperature for storage be maintained below OOC, more preferably below 20 C. The solution in which an effective amount of an albumin, according to the present invention, is incorporated does maintain its activity during the storing, whether it is in the form of a solution or in a frozen form, or during the steps of purification and manufacturing pharmaceutical preparations. Further, the method for stabilizing the physiologically active substance of the present invention, is also applicable to lyophilization. Illustratively stated, when solutions of the physiologically active substance especially, in the case of highly purified active substance are subjected to lyophilization, the activities thereof generally markedly drop.However, the solutions containing an effective amount of an albumin, according to the present invention, are lyophilized without losing its activity to give a powder of the physiologically active substance. The powder may be dissolved to give a stable aqueous solution in which the concentrations of the albumin and the active substance fall within the range as defined above. The albumin may, alternatively, be incorporated in the lyophilized preparations of the physiologically active substances. When the physiologically active substance is stored in a powdery form, it is preferred that the temperature for storage be maintained at room temperature or below. In the below mentioned in vivo assay in which aMeth A sarcoma transplanted mouse is used, when 300 units of the purified physiologically active substance which has been stabilized according to the present invention is administered to the mouse, the activity is evaluated as . Also, significant growth inhibition or regression of the cancer is observed after administration of the purified physiologically active substance, as compared with control mice which are injected with a physiological saline, in the mice which have been transplanted with colon carcinoma Colon 26.Further, the cytotoxic activity against various cancer cells of the purified physiologically active substance is evaluated in substantially the same manner as the in vitro assay method as mentioned later except that KB cells adenocarcinoma , PC 8 cells lung cancer , and normal cells fetal human kidney cells and fetal human foreskin cells as control are used instead of L M cells and the cells are incubated at 37 C for 72 hours instead of at 37 OC for 48 hours. As a result, the purified physiologically active substance exhibits significant cytotoxic activity against the cancer cells while exhibiting no cytotoxic activity against the normal cells. To assay the activity of TNF, there are usually employed two methods, i.e.the in vivo method in which the tumor necrosis effect is measured in vivo, and the in vitro method in which the cytotoxic effect on neoplastic cells is measured in vitro. 1 In vivo assay method As the in vivo method, there can be mentioned, for example, the method of Carswell et al see Proc. Nat.Acad. Sci. USA, 72 9 , 3666 3670 1975 . According to this method, Meth A cells 2 x 105 cells are transplanted intradermally at armpit of each of BALB c mice and, 7 days later, mice with tumors of 7 8 mm in diameter, good vascularization and no spontaneous central necrosis are selected for evaluation. A sample 0.5 ml diluted with a physiological saline solution is injected through the tail vein of each of the mice.The activity of the sample is evaluated after 24 hours according to the following criterion. no change slight hemorrhagic necrosis moderate hemorrhagic necrosis central necrosis extending over approximately 50 t of the tumor surface marked hemorrhagic necrosis massive necrosis leaving a small viable rim along the tumor periphery 2 In vitro assay method As the in vitro method for the assay of activity, there can be mentioned, for example, the method of Ruff et al see Lymphokines, Vol. 2, edited by E. Pick, Academic Press, N.Y., 245 248 1980 and the method ofKull et al see J. Immunol., 126 4 , 1279 1283 1981 . The in vitro method that the present inventors have employed for the assay of activity has been developed by improving the above mentioned conventional methods. The in vitro method of the present inventors, in which the cytotoxic activity of TNF against L M cells American Type Culture Collection CCL 1.2 is measured, is carried out as follows. As culture vessel, there are employed 96 well microtiter plates produced by FlowLaboratories, Inc. U.S.A. r and L M cells are cultured in Eagle s minimum essential medium see Science, 130, 432 437 1959 containing 10 v vt fetal calf serum.A sample 0.1 ml serially diluted with the medium and the L M cell suspension 0.1 ml, 1 x 104 cells are mixed in each well of the plates and the plates are incubated at 37 OC for 48 hours in an air containing 5 carbon dioxide. At the end of the culture period, a 20 aqueous solution of glutaraldehyde 20 p1 is added to fix the cells. After fixation, the plates are washed with distilled water and allowed to dry, and 0.05 methylene blue 0.1 ml is added to stain the viable cells. The plates are thoroughly washed with distilled water to remove excess dye and allowed to dry. 3 Hydrochloric acid 0.2 ml is added to each well to extract the dye from stained cells.Absorbance of each well at 665 nm is measured withTitertek Multiskan produced by Flow Laboratories, Inc.,USA. The absorbance is proportional to the number of viable cells. The activity, unit U ml, is defined as the reciprocal dilution of TNF that causes 50 cytotoxicity, and can be obtained by plotting the dilution versus the absorbance on a graph. All the activities, assayed according to the in vitro method, as used hereinafter are expressed by the above defined unit except in Referential Examples 1 and 2. InReferential Examples 1 and 2, the activity is evaluated in substantially the same manner as described above except that L929 cells American Type Culture Collection, CCL 1 are used instead of L M cells and Eagle s minimum essential medium containing 1 v v fetal calf serum and 5 pg ml actinomycin D is used instead ofEagle s minimum essential medium containing 10 v v fetal calf serum, and that the incubation is effected for 21 hours instead of 48 hours. According to the method of the present invention, efficient and steady supply, on a commercial scale, of the highly purified physiologically active substance, which is believed to be a clinically applicable effective antitumor medicine, can be ensured because in the method of the present invention, the activity of the active substance is maintained during the storing, whether the active substance is in the form of a solution, a frozen mass or a lyophilized preparation, and during the steps of purification and manufacturing pharmaceutical preparations. It has also been found that the solution or powder, in which human albumin is incorporated, can be safely administered to the human body, wherefore the novel composition of the present invention is especially useful when the physiologically active substance is clinically applied as an antitumor medicine. The present invention will now be described in more detail with reference to the following ReferentialExample, Working Examples and Comparative Example that by no means limit the scope of the invention. In practicing the present invention, construction of a recombinant DNA and insertion of a recombinant DNA to a microorganism were carried out in accordance with the procedure described in the following experimental reports Literatures 1 to 4 , unless otherwise indicated. 1 Yasutaka Takagi, Manual For Genetic Engineering, Kodan sha, Tokyo 2 Yasutaka Takagi, Experimental Method In Genetic Engineering, Kodan sha, Tokyo. 3 .T.

To the collected blood, heparin sodium is added in an amount of 100 units per 100 ml. The blood is then centrifuge while cooling at 5,000 rpm for 30 minutes to remove blood cells and insoluble solids. As 2 result, a plasma 2.4 liters having a serum TNF cytotoxic activity of 3 x 104 units ml is obtained from 40 rabbits. Step 2 Partial purification of TNF from rabbit serum To the plasma 2.4 liters obtained in Step 1, added is 24 g of cellite. The resultant is stirred for one hour, and then subjected to filtration. The filtrate is mixed with 1.2 liters of 0.04 M Tris HCl buffer pH 7.8 , and then applied to a column of DEAE Sepharose CL 6B manufac . tured and sold by Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Inc. Sweden sufficiently equilibrated with 0.04 M Tris ECl buffer pH 7,8 containing 0.1 M NaCl. The column is washed with 0.04 M Tris BCl buffer, and the adsorbed TNF is eluted with 0.04 M Tris HCl buffer 7.2 containing 0.18 M NaCl.Fractions exhibiting cytotoxic activities against L cells are concentrated by ultrafiltration. The so obtained concentrate is applied to a column of Sephacryl S 200 manufactured and sold by Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Inc.Sweden sufficiently equilibrated with 5 mx. phosphate buffer and gel filtered using the same buffer. The active fractions are concentrated by ultrafiltration, whereby a purified TNF having an activity of 3.5 x 106 units and a specific activity of 18 x 106 units mg is obtained. Step 3 Anti TNF antibody The rabbit serum TNF partially purified in Step 2 is mixed with complete Freund s adjuvant 1 1 , and then injected subcutaneously at the back of a 12 week age BALB c male mouse. The above operation is repeated 2 and 4 weeks after the initial injection. One week after the last injection, whole blood is collected. From the collected blood, a serum is obtained. The so obtained serum is. added to the culture medium for evaluation of the cytotoxic activity of TNF against L cells in such an amount that it is diluted 500 fold in final concentration. The cytotoxic activity of the rabbit serumTNF against L cells is evaluated in the same manner as described before. It is found that the rabbit serum TNF exhibits no cytotoxicity against L cells.Prom the above result, it can be concluded that the mouse serum obtained in this step contains an antibody to the rabbit serum TNF hereinafter referred to as anti TNF antibody . Step 4 Preparation of TNF producing cells A female rabbit is injected intravenously with formalin killed cells of Propionibacterium acnes Coryne bacterium parvum Wellcome Research Laboratories, England .Seven davs later, the rabbit is subjected to tracheotomy, and the lung is washed with a physiological saline solution, whereby floating cells are obtained. The so obtained cells are washed with a physiological saline solution. Using as a culture medium RPMI 1640 Flow laboratories Inc., U.S.A. containing 10 v v fetal calf serum, the cells are incubated at 370C in air containing 5 t carbon dioxide.The cell culture is divided into two groups, and to one of them endotoxin derived from Escherchia coli lipopolysaccharide from Escherchia coli 026 B6, produced by Difco Laboratories, U.S.A. is added at a concentration of lo g ml. The same amount of sterile water is added to the other. The supernatant of the cell culture to which endotoxin is added exhibits cytotoxic activity against L cells, and the activity reaches the maximum value within seven hours. Such activity is dissipated by the anti TNF antibody, but is not dissipated by the normal mouse serum. On the other hand, the supernatent of the cell culture to which no endotoxin is added exhibits no cytotoxicity against L cells. Step 5 Molecular weight of TNF To the cell culture prepared in Step 4 to which endotoxin is added, radioactive L 35S methionine 1300 Ci mmol, produced by Amersham Industries plc, England is further added 1 mCi ml . In accordance with the method of Laemmli see Laemmli, U.K. 1970 , Nature London , Vol. 227, pp 680 685 , the supernatant is analyzed by the SDSpolyacryl2mide gel electrophoresis.The gel concentration is adjusted to 12.5 wt t. After the electrophoresis, the gel is treated with ENHANCE trademark of a product of New England Nuclear Inc., U.S.A. , and after drying, is exposed to X ray film Fuji RX, manufactured and sold by Fui Photo Film Co., Ltd., Japan . In the supernatant of the cell culture in the presence of endotoxin, it is observed that z substance having a molecular weight of about 17500 is formed. Further, the supernatant of each cell culture prepared in Step 4 is subjected to SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the same manner as described above. Thereafter, the gel is shaken in 2.5 t NP 40 a surface active agent sold by Calbiochem, U.S.A. for one bort and then in water for two hours. After shaking, each migration lane is separate by cutting, and cut into strips of 2 m width in a direction perpendicular to the direction of migration. Each strip is cultured with L cells, and evaluated for cytotoxic activity against L cells.In the lane on which the supernatant of the cell culture containing endotoxin is enveloped, cytotoxicity againstL cells is observed at a position corresponding to the molecular weight of 17500. No cytotoxicity is observed at other positions. Step 6 Extraction of mRNA The cell culture as prepared in Step 4 is incubated for 2 hours after addition of endotoxin, followed by centri fugation to collect cells. Extraction of cytoplasmic RNA from the collected cells and extraction of mRNA from the cytopolasmicRNA are effected in accordance with the method of Chirgwin et al see Chirgwin, J.M. et al, Biochemistry, Vol. 18, p. 5294 1979 1. 4 ml of a 4 N guanidine thiocyanate solution is added to 3 x 108 cells, and the mixture is pulverized by means of a homogenizer Model AM 7, manufactured and sold by Nihon Seiki Seisakusho, Japan .The residues are removed by centrifugation, and 2.4 g of cesium chloride is dissolved therein. The mixture is carefully poured into 2 polyallomer tube in which 2.5 ml of 5.7 M cesium chloride and 0.1 M EDT A solution pH 7.5 has been loaded in advance, and then subjected to ultracentrifugation at 30,000 rpm for 12 hours at 200C using Beckman SW41 rotor manufactured and sold byBeckman Instrument, U.S.A. . After removal of the supernatant, the pellet is dissolved in 1 ml of 10 mM Tris HCl buffer containing 5 mM EDTA and 1 w v t SDS . The resulting solution is extract with a 4 1 by volume mixture of chloroform and 1 butanol. To the aqueous phase, 0.05 volume of 2.M sodium acetate end 2.5 volumes of ethanol are added, and allowed to stand at 200C for 2 hours or more, thereby to precipitate RNA. The precipitate is collected by centrifugation, dried, and then dissolved in 500 l of sterile water. As 2 result, 2 cytoplasmic RNA solution is obtained. The above obtained RNA solution is heated at 680C for 2 minutes, and thereafter, chilled cuickly. 500 l of 2 fold concentration 10 mM Tris EDTA buffer pH 7.4 containing 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 w v SDS and 0.5 lithium chloride is added to the solution, and the mixture is applied to a 200 mg oligo dT cellulose manufactured and sold by Bethesda ResearchLaboratories, Inc., U.S.A. column, and washed with 10 ml of the same buffer one fold concentration as described above. The material retained by the column is eluted with 2 ml of an elution buffer containing 10 mM Tris HCl buffer pE 7.4, 1 mMEDTA and 0.1 w v SDS. To the eluate, is added 0.05 volume of sodium acetate and 2.5 volumes of ethanol, and the mixture is cooled at 200C to precipitate.The precipitate is collected by cantrifigation, and applied to the olio dT cellulose column, and the fractions adsorbed onto the olio dT cellulose are collected. 85 pg of mRNA is recovered as determined by the ultraviolet spectrum analysis. Step 7 Size fractionation of mRNA 880 g of mRNA prepare by the same method as described inStep 6 is dissolved in 250 l of water, and the resulting solution is layered onto a 10 ml 5 25 z linear sucrose density gradient. The sucrose density gradient is prepared by means ofISCO 570 gradienter manufactured and sold by ISCO Inc.,U.S.A. , using Tris buffer solutions lcontaining 25 mM Tris HCl pH 7.2 , 2 mM EDTA and 1 w v SDS respectively containing 5 sucrose and 25 sucrose. Using Beckman DZ41 rotor, ultracentrifugation is effected at 40000 rpm for 12 hours at 40C, and fractions each of 400 pl are recovered by means of a fraction recovering apparatus manufactured and sold by Beckman Instrument, U S.A. , and then ethanol precipitated. The precipitated fractions are centrifused, and dissolved in sterile water. Step 8 Experiment on translation of mRNA Translation of mRNA using oocytes ofXenopus laevis Hamamatsu biological teaching materials is conducted according to the procedure described in the experimental reports for example, Hiroshi Teraoka, Mikio Itsuki and Kentero Tanaka, Protein, Nucleic acid, Enzyme ,Genetic Engineering, extra edition., 19S1, p 602 . Xe Xenopus laevis is procured from Hamamatsu biological teaching materials. Fractionated mRNA obtained in Step 7 is dissolved in sterile water to have a concentration of 1 g l, and the solution is injected into oocytes in such a small amount as 50 nl per cell. Cells are then cultured for 24 hours in a Barth s solution containing 7.5 mM Tris HCl pH 7.6 , 88 mM NaCl, 1 mM potassium chloride, 0.33 mm calcium nitrate, 0.41 mM calcium chloride, 0.82 mM magnesium sulfate, 2.4 m. sodium bicarbonate, 18 U ml penicillin G and 18 pc ml streptomycin which contains 1 mg ml bovine serum albumin. Oocytes are crushed, in the culture liquid, by means of a glass bar.The culture licuid is then centrifuged, and the supernatant is evaluated for the cytotcxic activity against L cells.mRNA which will be translated to give a polypeptide having maximum activity sediments as 16 S in size. This activity is eliminated by the anti TNF antibody obtained in Step 3, but is not eliminated by the normal mouse serum. Step 9 Preparation of transormants Using 5 g of the fractionated mRNA. obtained in Step 7, 2 double stranded DNA is prepared in accordance with procedure described in Literature 1 , from page 96. As the reverse transcriptase, use is made of a product of Life Science,Inc., U.S.A. The double stranded DNA is size fractionated on a 3.5 polyacrylamide gel, and 330 ng fraction of about 1000 to 2000 bp is obtained.In accordance with the procedure described in Literature 1 , 7 ng of this fraction is extended with deoxyC residues using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase manufactured and sold byBethesda Research Laboratories, Inc., U.S.A. . and annealed with 56 ng of plasmid pBR322 which has been digested withPstI and extended with deoxyG residue. The so annealed mixture is inserted into E. coli K 12 strain H3101, ATCC 33694 to transform the strain. As a result, 12000 transformants are obtained. Step 10 Partial amino acid sequence of rabbit TNF Rabbit TNF partially purified in Step 2 activity 5 x 107 units is subjected to SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for purification as in Step 5. Part of the gel is dyed with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. A band at the position corresponding to the molecular weight of 17000 is cut out from the gel, and extracted with 1 ammonium bicarbonate. About 180 g of TNF is recovered as protein. 150 g of the recovered TNF is dissolved in 75 g of 1 ar monium bicarbonate, followed by addition of 3 pg of TPCK resin manufactured and sold by Worthington Biochemical,U.S.A. . The mixture is incubated at 370C for 4 hours.The mixture is then fractionated by means a high performance liquid chromatography column comprising Cosmosil 5C8 manufactured and sold by Nakarai Chemical, Ltd., Japan as the packing material1 thereby to obtain fragments digested with trypsin. The highly purified TNF and the trypsin digested fragments thereof are then subjected to desalting by means of Se hadexG 25 column, and then freeze dried. According to the method of R.M. Hewick et al see J. Biol. Chem., Vol. 256, pp 7990 7997, 1981 , the purified TNF and the trypsin digested fragments are each subjected to Edman Degradation from the N terminal.PTH amino acid liberated in each step is analyzed bv the customary method by means of a high performance chromatography model SP8100 manufactured ane sold by Spectra physics, U.S.A. using Solpacks ODS manufactured and sold by E.I. Du pont, U.S.A. as the column As a result, it is found that the TN has the following N termincl amino acid sequence Ser Ala Ser Arg Ala Leu Ser Asp Lys Pro Leu AlaHis Val Val Ala Asn Pro Gln Val Glu Gly Gln Leu Gln One of the trypsin digested fragments has the following N terminal amino acid sequence Glu Thr Pro Glu Glu Ala Glu Pro Met Ala Step 11 Synthesis of oligodeoxynulcleotide probe Oligodeoxynucleotides complementary to the base sequence of the mRNA which is deduced from the amino acid sequence of rabbit TNF obtained in Step 10 is synthesized according to the improved phosphotriester method which has already been reported by the present inventor in H. Ito et al, Nucleic Acid Res. 10, 1755 1769 1982 .In preparing oligodeoxynucleotides, 128 oligodeoxynucleotides estimated from the amino acid sequence of rabbit TNF are classified into five groups, namely groups of 16, 16, 32, 32 and 32 and are synthesized as mixtures of oligodeoxynuc leotides of the respective groups.The obtained oligodeoxy nucleotides of the respective groups are deprotected according to the customary method and purified by column chromatography using Sephadex G 50 manufactured and sold byPharmacia Fine Chemicals, Inc.1 Sweden , electrophoresis on a 20 z by weight polyacrylam gel containing 7 M of urea and column chromatography using DE52 manufactured and sold by Whatman Ltd., U.S.A. . The thus obtained oligodeoxynucleotides of the respective groups are analyzed against 0.1 mM Tris EDTA buffer solution. Each of the purified oligodeoxynucleotides of the respective groups is labelled using T4 polynucleotide kinase rnanufactured and sold by Bethesda Research Laboratories, Inc., U.S.A. and gamma √™P adenosine triphosphate according to the customary method and then purified by column chromatography using DE52 manufactured and sold by Whatman Ltd., U.S.A. .Tne radioactive material is incorporated into each of oligodeoxynucleotides of the respective groups in an amount of about 3 x 108 cpm ug.

Step 12 Examination of oligonucleotide mRNA of the cells producing TNF which is obtained according to Step 6 is treated with a solution containing 1 M of glyoxal, 10 mM of NaH2PO4 and 50 8 by volume dimethyl sulfoxide at 50 C for 60 minutes and then subjected to fractionation using electrophoresis on a 1.1 8 by weight agarose gel. The fractionated mRNA is transferred on a filter of an electrophoresis type transfer blotting apparatus manufactured and sold by Bio Rad, U.S.A. according to the manual of the maker.Then the mRNA on the filter of the apparatus is. treated with a 5 x Denhardt s solution containing a 5 x SSC solution and 150 vg ml of denatured salmon spermatozoa DNA at 650C for two hours and, then treated with a 5 x Denhardt s solution containing 1 x 107 cpm ml of the labelled oligodeoxynucleotides and a 5 x SSC solution at 50 C for two hours. The above obtained filter is washed with a 6 x SSC solution successively four times at room temperature, 40 C, 500C and 600C. An XAR 5 X ray film manufactured and sold by Eastman Kodak Company, U.S.A. is exposed to the radiation from the filter.As z result, it is found that the oligodeoxynucleotides designated byProbe iJ are most strongly hybridized with the mB7A, showing that the oligodeoxynucleotide having a base sequence which is completely complimentary to the mRNA is contained in the oligodeoxynucleotides designated by Probe MJ. Step 13 Cloning of TNF gene of rabbit In accordance with the procedure described in Literature 2 , page 162, the transformants obtained in Step 9 of are transferred onto a cellulose filter and theDNA of the transformants is hybridized with the labelled oligodeoxynucleotide Probe MJ selected in Step 12 under the same conditions as inStep 12 colony hybridization . In the just above procedure, 49 colonies which are strongly hybridized with the labelled oligodeoxynucleotides Probe XJ ere selected and further fixed onto another nitrocellulose filter. Then using. 49 colonies, further hybridization is carried out to select nine colonies which are more strongly hybridized with the labelled oligodeoxynucleotides Probe MJ . In accordance with the rapid plasmid separating procedure described in Literature 1 , page 6, about 5 pug plasmid is obtained from each of the nine colonies. Each of the obtained piasmids is cleaved using restriction enzymes, PstI, TacI, RsaI and PvuII each manufactured and sold byBethesda Research Laboratories, Inc., U.S.A. according to the procedure described in the manual of the maker, followed by electrophoresis effected on a 1 by weight agarose gel. Then, fragments obtained by cleavage by the respective restriction enzymes are compared with respect to length thereof. The results suggest that all the nine strains corresponding to the nine colonies have the base sequence of the fragment obtained by cleavage by PvuII and RsaI end consisting of about 50 bp and that most of the nine strains have the base sequence of the fragment obtained by cleavage b RsaI and cons sting o about 200 bp. Tn oher words, the results suggest that the nine strains have partially common base sequences The results 0 . analysis by the restriction enzymes are shown in Fig. 1. Seven strains containing plasmids designated in Table 2 below art separately cultivated in 2 ml ot LB medium containing 10 g ml of tetracycline until the optical density of the solutions shows the values shown in Table 2 below, followed by centrifugation to obtain respective strains. Each of the obtained strains is separately added into 2 ml of physiclogical saline and disrupted by sonication. The obtained solutions are subjected to centrifugation and the cytotoxic activity against L cells of the obtained supernatants is determined. The results are shown in Table 2 below. As z blank test, the same procedures as mentioned above are repeated using a strain containing plasmid pBR322.The results are also shown in Table 2 below.

Step 14 Determination of base sequence of DNA coding for rabbit TNF E. coli strains containing plasmids pB2 7 and pR 18 are cultivated in one liter of M9 medium described in Literature 3 , page 440 and containing 10 pg ml of tetracycline. Then, in accordance with procedure described in Literature 3 , page 90, each of the plasmids is isolated in an amount of about 150 pg. The base sequence of the insert of each plasmid is determined according to the Maxam Gilbert chemical procedure described in Maxam et al Method in Enzymology , 55, P 490 1980 , Academic Press. The thus determined base sequence is found to be in agreement with the partial amino acid sequences determined in Step 9. Thus, the whole sequence ofTNF of rabbit is considered to be elucidated. Step 15 In this step, construction of a plasmid is carried out using the recombinant plasmid pR12 to obtain direct expression of TNF in E, coli using lac as a promoter. The procedures are illustratively shown in Fig. 2. First 10 pg of plasmid pR12 is digested with 10 units of Atal manufactured and sold byBethesda Research Laboratories, Inc., U.S.A. at 370C for two hours and electrophoresed on a 4 by weight polyacrylamide gel to isolate 610 bp fragments. About 1 g of the fragment is isolated from the gel by electroelution. In the same manner as in Step 10, two oligodeoxynucleotides shown in.Fig. 2, namely 5 GATCCATGTCAGCTTCTCGGGCC 3 and 5 CGAGAAGCTGACATG 3 are synthesized. Then, each 5 end of the oligooeoxynucleotices about 100 pmole is phosphorylated using T4 polynucleotide kinase in accordance with the method described in Literature 3 , page 122. After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture is extracted with phenol and then with chloroform. Then the obtained synthetic oligomers are mixed with 0.5 g of the Apal 630 bp fragment and ethanol precipitated. The fragment is ligated with the synthetic olicomers at BOC overnight using 10 units of T4 DNA ligase in accordance with the procedure described in Literature 1 , page 37.After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture is ethanol precipitated and digested with 20 units of BamHI at 370C for three hours, followed by electrophoresis effected on a 4 t by weight polyacrylamide gel to recover 670bp fragment vby elettroelution.One g of commercially availabl√´ plasmid pUC 8 catalog No. 4O16, manufactured and sold by P L Biochemicals, Inc., U.S.A. is digested wit BamHI and extracted with phenol and then with chloroform, followed by ethanol precipitation to obtain a vector. 0.5 pg of the obtained vector is ligated with te above obtained fragment having BamHI sites on its both ends and containing about 670 b coding for TNF using T4 DNA ligase. In accordance with the procedure described in Literature 4 , page 20,E. coli JMlOl is transformed using the above obtained vector and cultivated on an agar medium containing 1 mM ofIPTG and 0.004 t w v of X gal to obtain about 200 white √ßolonies.Plasmid DNA is prepared from 100 of these transformants and digested with BamHI, As z result, it is found that 15 plasmids contain the intended BamMI fragment about 670 bp . In order to examine te direction of insertion, the above 15 plasmids are digested with EcoRI having only one recognition site on its pUC 8 and PvuII having only one recognition site on its about 670 base pair fragment part and electrophoresed on a 6 by weight polyacrylamide gel As a result, it is determined that 7 plasmids have the intended fragment consisting of about 140 bp and that the direction of transcription of the lac promotor on DUC 8 is in agreement with that of the oligodeoxynucleotides coding for TNF. DNA sequence analysis shows that these seven plasmids have the same sequence and have the desired nucleotide sequence at the junctions between the lac promoter, synthetic DNA and cDNA. Step 16 Construction of further plasmids is carried out using the recombinant plasmid pR17 in order to obtain direct expression of TNF in w coli using lac UV5 as a promoter.The procedures are illustratively shown in Fig. 3. First, 10 g of the plasmid pRl7 is digested with 10 units of Apal manufactured and sold by Bethesda Research Laboratories, Inc,U.S.A. at 370C for two hours and electrophoresed on a 4 by weight polyacrylamide gel to isclate a fragment consisting of about 630 bp. About 1 g of the fragment is isolated from the gel by electroelution. In the same manner as in Step 10, two oligodeoxynucleotides shotm in Fig. 3, namely 5 AATTCATGTCAGCTTCTCGGGCC 3 and 5 CGAGAAGCTGACATG 3 are synthesized.Then, each 5 end of the two oligodeoxynucleotides about 100 pmole is phosphorylated using T polynucleotide kinase in accordance with the method described in Literature 3 , page 122 After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture is extracted with phenol and then with chloroform. Then the synthetic oligomers are mixed with 0.5 g of the previously obtained ApaI fragment about 630 b prepared from the plasmid pRl7 and ethanol precipitated. The fragment is ligatec with the synthetic oligomers at 4 C overnight using 10 units ofT4 ligase in accordance with procedure described in Literature 1 , page 37.After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture is ethanol precipitated and digested with 20 Urits of EcoRI at 370C for three hours, followed bv electrophoresis effected on a 4 z by weight polyacrylamide gel to recover 2 fragment about 670 bp by electroelution. In accordance with the procedure described in F. Fuller, Gene , 19, pp 42 5z 1982 , plasmid pOP95 15 is prepared. One g of pOP95 15 is digested with EcoRI and extracted with phenol and then with chloroform, followed by ethanol precipitation to obtain G vector. Using T4 DNA ligase, 0.5 g of the obtained vector is ligated with the fragment about 670 bp obtained by ligating the synthetic oligonucleotide with the oligonucleotide coding for TNF.In accordance with the procedure described in Literature 4 , page 20, E. coli Jtl101 ATCC 33876 is transformed using the above obtained vector and cultivated on 2 medium containing 1 m of IPTG and 0.004 w v of X gal to obtain about 150 white colonies. Plasmie DNA is prepared from 100 of these colonies and digested wit EcoRI As a result, it is found that 12 plasmids contain the intended EcoRI fragment about 670 bp . In order to examine the direction of insertion, the above 12 plasmids are digested withPvuII and PstI and electrophoresed on a 1.5 9 by weight agerose gel.As a result1 it is determined that four plasmids have the desired fragments about 1280 bp and about 2600 b and that the direction of transcription of the lac UV5 promoter is in agreement with that of the oligodeoxynucleotides coding for TNF. Base sequence analysis shows that these four plasmide have the same sequence and that the lac UV5 promoter, the synthetic olicodeoxynucleotide and cDNz are properly combined with each other. The obtained plasmids are designated pINF lacUV5 1. Step 17 Purific2tion of TNF produced by E. coli E. coli strains containing plasmids obtained in Step 16 are cultivated on 50 ml of LB medium containing 100 g ml of ampicillin at 37CC overnight. Then the strains are transferred to 5 liter of LB medium containing 100 g ml of ampicillin and further cultivated at 370C for three hours. Isopropyl ss D thiogalactopyranoside manufactured and sold d bySigma Chemical Company, Inc., U.S.A. is added to it to a final concentration of 1 mM. Further cultivation is carried out for six hours, followed by cooling. Then strains are collected by centrifugation. In the same manner as described in Step 13 theStrains are added into 5 liters of 0.04 M Tris ECl buffer solution pH 7.8 and disrupted by sonication to obtain a strain protein solution. The obtained solution has cytotoxic activity against L cells of 5 x 107 units liter. The obtained solution is purified in the same manner as LW Step 2 to obtain 1.2 x 106 units of TNF. The specific activity of the TNF is 6.8 x 107 units mg. Step 18 Evaluation using transplanted Meth A sarcoma in mouse A sample 0.2 ml of TNF obtained in Step .17 are subjected to evaluation by the in vivo assay method as described before. Further, 20 Days after the injection of the sample, observations are made on the involution of tumors and re covery rate is determined according to the following equation.

Specifically, colonies of E. coli K12 strain MC1061 are cultured in LB medium until the optical density of the culture broth becomes 0.3 at 550nm. 50ml of the grown E. coli culture is harvested washed with a 25ml mixture containing 10mM MOPS pH7.0 and 10mM RbCl, and resuspended in a 25ml mixture containing 0.1M MOPS pH6.5 , 5mMCaCl2 and 10mM RbCl.The resulting suspension is cooled on ice for 30 min , centrifuged and suspended in z mixture of 2ml of the above mentionec mixture containing 0.1MMOPS pH6.5 , 50mM CaCl2 and 10mM RbCl and 30 l of DMSO.To a 200 l aliquot of the resulting suspension is separately added 10 l o each of the plasmid DNA solutions. Each of the resulting mixtures is cooled on ice for 30 min, and then heat shocked at 440C for 60 seconds. Immediately thereafter, 5ml of the LB medium pre warmed at 37 C is added to each o the heated mixtures, followed by incubation at 37 C for one hour. The obtained ci.ure broths are each subjected to centrifugation to form cell pellets. The supernatant is discarded, and LB medium is added and stirred to resuspend each of the cell pellets.Each of the resulting suspensions is inoculated to an LB agar plate containing 30 g ml tetracycline, followed by incubation at 37 C overnight. As a result, colonies of tetracycline resistant transformants transformed, each, wit pR18, pE2 7 and pB2 2 plasmids are obtained. Step 2 Preparation of pB2 7 and pR18 Plasmid DNAs Each of the transformants respectively transformed with pB2 7 and pR18 plasmids which are obtained in Step 1 is subjected to 1 growth of the transformant and ampli fication of the plasmid 2 harvesting ane lysis of the transformant, and 3 purification of the plasmid DNA, in accordance with the procedures as described at pages 8S 96 of T. Maniatis, E.F. Fritsch and J. Sambrook, MolecularCloning , published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, U.S.A.Illustratively stated, each of the transformants is inoculated into LB medium and incubated at 37 C with vigorous shaking. This step is repeated to attain growth of the transformant and amplification of the plasmid. The tansformant culture is harvested by centrifugation at 4000g for 10 min.at 4 C. The supernatant is discarded. The resulting pellet is washed in 100 ml of ice cold STE 0.lM NaCl, lOmMTris. Cl pH7.8 and the EDTA , and subjected to lysis by boiling by the use of 20 mg ml lysozyme in 10 mM Tris Cl, pH 8.0.The viscous product is transferred to an ultracentrifuge tube, and centrifuged at 25,000 rpm for 30 min at 4CC to obtain a DNA solution. The volume of the DNA solution is measured. For every milliliter, exactly lg of solid is addd 2.5 l of Solution C DNaseI, DNA Polymerase I , and reacted at 150C for 60 min. Then, Solution D stop buffer is added to the resulting mixture to stop the reaction. Further, carrier tRNA is added, subjected to ethanol precipitation twice and dissolved in 500 l of water.The specific activity per g DNA is 9.3 x 107 cpm. With respect to the pure pR18 plasmid DNA obtained inStep 2, also, the above described procedures are carried out to effect the nick translation. The specific activity per g DNA was 7 x 107 cpm. Step 4 Preparation of RsaI Inset Fragment of pR18 Plasmid DNA 80 ,ug of the pR18 plasmid DNA is digested with RsaI restriction enzyme, and subjected to electrophoresis through 4 polyacrylamide gel. The following desired bands of insarts. are cut out and purified bv means of the BND column about 640 bp 3.77 pg recovery 52 about 175 bp 1.77 g recovery 50 e . The above about 640 bp insert is designated as 3 fragment of pR18 meaning 3 un.ranslated region of pR18 , and the above about 175 bp insert is designated as pR18 cTr meaning coding region of pR18 . Moreover, the above procedures are repeasted using PstI and MstII restriction enzymes istead of the RsaI restriction enzyme to obtain the following band about 450 bp 3.65 pg recovery 60 The above insert is designated as 5 fragment of pR18. Step 5 Isolation of the Human Genomic TNF Gene The √™P labelled plasmid pB2 7 insert obtained in Step 3 ofExample 1 is used as a hybridization probe to screen 106 plaques of bacteriophage Charon 4A human genomic library prepared by insertion into the Charon 4A EcoRI ligation site Blattner et al, Science 196, 161 1977 of sized fragments from partially digested human DNA Maniatis et al, Cell 15, 687 1978 . The plaque hybridization method of Breton and Davis Benton andDavis, Science , 196, 180 1977 is used. Since not all of the bacteriophage in the startling culture contain the necessary genetic material for preparing human TNF, a probe which has a base sequence complementary to the rabbit TNF gene is used.DNA of phage plaques having the desired genetic material incorporated the radioactive probe and are identified by their radioactivity. Nine hybridizing plaques are isolated from the library. The procedures and conditions used are as follows. 1 Number of plaques 1 x 106 plaques 4 x 104 plaques 150 mm plate x 25 2 Transfer to nitrocellulose filters see Benton and Davis, Science, 196, 186 i977 3 3 Bybridization Addition of 1.25 x 105 cpm ml of pB2 7 insert probe prepared in Step 3 of Example 1, 420C, 19.5 hr 4 Washing 2 x SSC 0.1 SDS at room temp.ImmersionEMI59.1 min. x 4 1 x SSC 0.1 t SDS at 500C Immersion 30 min. x 2 5 Exposure XAR 5 Eastman Kodak Company, U.S.A. 800C, 2 intensifying screens, 39 hr In the above screening, 12 candidate strains are obtained.In the same manner as mentioned above, second screening is carried out to obtain nine strains containing the intended fragment. Using these strains, third screening is carried out in the same manner as mentioned above to obtain nine strains containing the intended fragment. Using the obtained strains fourth screening is carried out to confirm that the nine strains contain the intended fragment. The obtained nine bacteriophages containing the intended fragment are designated HG 1 HG 9, respectively. Step 6 Isolation of Rabbit Genomic TNF Gene Substantially the same procedure as described in Step 5 of Example are repeated except that 106 plaques of bacteriophageCharon 4 A rabbit genomic library which is prepared using digested rabbit DNA Manictis et al, Cell, 15, 687 1978 instead of digested human DNA. 6.7 x 105 plaques of bacteriophage Charon 4A rabbit genomic library are used instead of 106 plaques of the bacteriophage Charon 4A human genomic library. Thus, there is obtained two bacteriophage strains RG 1 and RG 2 containing the rabbit genomic TNF gene. Step 7 Southern blotting analysis of human clones Using the bacteriophages HG 3, EG 6 and BG 7 obtained inStep 5 of Example 1, DNA of each bacteriophage is obtained according to the following procedures. 6 x 1010 cells of E. coli LE392 host cell are suspended in 18 ml of SM and 3 x 109 PFU of bacteriophage BG 3 is added, thus allowing the . coli to be infected at 370C for 20 minutes. The, the obtained mixture is added in 3 liters of NZ broth and subjected to shaking culture at 370C for 23 hours. 60 ml of CECl3 is added to the mixture and further subjected to shaking culture for 30 minutes. NaCl is added to the mixture to a final concentration of 1 M, the mixture is allowed to stand for 15 minutes, followed by centrifugation to obtain supernatant. Then, polyethylene glycol molecular weight about 6000 is added to the mixture so that the concentration of polyethylene glycol becomes 10 w v , and allowed to stand for 22 hours at 4 C. Bacteriophages are collected by centrifugation. The obtained bacteriophages are suspended in 28 ml of SM and an equal volume of CHCl3 is added.After stirring by means of Vortex for 30 seconds, the mixture is subjected to centrifugation to obtain aqueous phase. SM is added to the aqueous phase so that the total amount becomes 30 ml. 26.4 g ofCsCl is added to the obtained mixture and dissolved gently, followed by ultracentrifugation 45000 rpm, 20 hours to obtain bacteriophages in the form of a band. The obtained mixture containing bacteriophages is dialyzed against iO.mM NaCl 50 rn Tris pH8 10 mM X.gC12. Then, EDTA, Proteinase K and SDS are added to the mixture so that the concentrations of them are 20 mM, 50 pg ml and 0.5 8 w v , respectively.Then the mixture is treated at 650C for one hour and extracted with phenol, a mixture of phenol and CHCl3 1 1 by volume and then with CHCl3.The obtained aqueous phase is dialyzed against 10 me. Tris pus 1 mM EDTA. The ultraviolet absorption measurement of the obtained aqueous phase shows that pure DNA of the bacteriophageBG 3 is obtained. Substantially the same procedures as described with respect to the preparation of DNA of the bacteriophage HG 3 are repeated to obtain DNAs of bacteriophages HG 6 and HG 7. Thus, there are obtained 2920 g of HG 3, 1100 g of HG 6 and 819 g of HG 7. In accordance with the Southern method E.M. Southern,J. Mol.Biol., 98, 503 1975 , Southern blotting analysis of the obtained DNAs is performed.

Step 8 Southern blotting analysis of rabbit clones Substantially the same procedures as in Step 7 ofExample 1 are repeated except that each of the bacteriophages RG 1 and RG 2 is used instead of each of the bacteriophages HG 3, HG 6 and HG 7. Thus, there is performed Southern blotting analysis. As a result, it is found that pR18 51 fragment is hybridized with a single band fragment of fragments which are obtained by cleavage of RG l and RG 2 with each of B2mHI, EcoRI, Bale, Bind and BamBI EcoRI. Step 9 of bacterial clones conteining human genomic TNF gene The method of Landy et al Biochemistry, Vol. 13, 2134 1974 is used to obtain DNA of HG 3 as obtained in the above Step 5. 33 ,ug of the resulting HG 3 DMA is digested with 80 units of EcoRI at 370C for 3 hours. The digest is electrophoresed on 1 low melting agarose gel conditions 1 x TAE, 20 V, 14.5 hr . The 2.9 kb bend is isolated from the agarose gel as described by T. Maniatis MolecularCloning, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, p 377 1982 . Specifically, the cut out gel of the 2.9 kS band portion is heated at 650 for 15 min. The EcoRi cleaved HG 3 fragment having a length ot 2.9 kb hereinafter often referred to as HG 3 EcoRI 2.9 kb. fragment is recovered from the melted gel by extracting 3 times with phenol and then 3 times with ethanol, followed by precipitation with ethanol containing ammonium acetate. Thus, there is obtained 657 ng yield about 30 of HG 3 EcoRI 2.9 kb fragment. 255 ng of the above obtained fragment is ligated to 56.5 ng of EcoRI cleaved pUC 13 IJ. Messing, Methods inEnzymology, Vol. 101, 20 1983 using 2.5 units of T4 lipase at 4 C for 20 hours. E. coli K 12 strain JM83 is transformed using the aboveobtained ligation product. Specifically, E. coli K12 strain JM83 is cultured in LB medium until the optical density of the culture broth becomes 0.3 at 550 nm. 50 ml of the grownE. coli K12 strain JM83 culture is collected, washed with a 25 ml of 10 mM MOPS pH7.0 10 RbCl. ane resuspended into a 25 ml of 0.1 M MOPS pH6.5 50 mM CaCl2 10 mM RbCl.The suspension is cooled on ice fcr 30 min., centrifuged and resuspended in 2 mixture of 2 ml of 0.1 M MOPS pH6.5 50 mM CaCl2 10 mM RbCl and 30 l of DMSO. To 203 l of the suspension is added 10 l of an aqueous ligation product solution containing 10 ng of the libation product. The mixture is cooled on ice for 30 min. and then heated at 420C for 60 seconds. Immediately thereafter, 5 ml of LB broth prewarmed at 37CC is added to the heated mixture, followed by incubation at 37 C for one hour. The obtained culture broth is subjected to centrifugation and the supernatant is removed.An LB medium is added to the resulting cell pellet and then inoculated on an LB plate containing 30 g ml ampicillin and 40 g ml X gal. Colonies containing E. coli K12 strain JM83 which have been transformed with the plasmids having the insert are white, while those containing E. coli K12 strainJM83 which have been transformed with plasmid only are blue. The obtained white colonies are inoculated again on LB plate containing 30 g ml ampicillin and 40 g ml X gal for the purpose of confirmation. Prom the above obtained white colonies ten colonies bacterial clones are selected and screened by using mini prep technique of Holmes and Quigley Anal. Biochem.,Vol. 114, 193 1981 Specifically, each colony is cultured overnight onLB medium containing 30 g ml ampicillin. The grown cells are collected and suspended in 2 mg ml lysozyme 50 mM glucose 10 mM EDTA 25 mM Tris HCl pH8.0 . The suspension is allowed to stand at room temperature for 5 minutes, followed by addition of 200 l or 0.2 N NaOH 1 SDS. After slowly stirring, the suspension is allowed to stand at room temperature for 2 min.Thereafter, 150 l of 3 M sodium acetate pH5.2 is added, allowed to stand at 20 C for 10 min., followed 5 centrifugation for 15 min. to recover the resulting supernatant. To the supernatant is added 900 l of cold ethanol, followed by centrifugation for 5 min.to obtain the resulting precipitate. The obtained precipitate is washed with 70 z ethanol and dried to get a plasmid DNA.In the above mentioned method, ten plasmid DNAs are obtained Each plasmid DNA is dissolved in 10 mm Tris 0.1 mMEDTA pH8.0 , digested with EcoRI and subjected to electrophoresis fo restriction analysis.

The results of the restriction enzyme analysis are shown in Fig. 4. Step 12 Restriction enzyme analysis of pRGE plasmid DNA In substantially the same manner as in the above Step 11, the restriction enzyme analysis of pRGE plasmid DNA prepared in the above Step 10 is effected, except that pRGE plasmidDNA is used instead of pHGE plasmid DNA. The restriction map of pRGE DNA insert obtained is shown in Fig. S. Step 13 Determination of base sequences of rabbit TNF gene and human TNF gene Substantially the same procedures as in the aboveStep 2 are repeated, except that E. coli K12 strain JM83 pHGE obtained in the above Step 9 and E. coli K12 strainJM83 pRGE obtained in the above Step 10 are used instead of E. coli K12. strain MC1061 having pB2 7 and E. coli K12 strain MC1061 having pR18. Thus, 150 g of each of pRGE plasmid DNA and pHGE plasmid DNA is obtained. The base sequences of pRGE and pHGE are determined according to the Maxam Gilbert method Naxarn et al, Methods in Enzymology, Vol. 55, 490 1980 published by AcademicPress . The base sequence of pR 18 determined in Referential Example 1 is compared with that of pRGE as determined above to elucidate the structure, including exon and intron, of rabbit TNF gene. The structure of pRGE DNA insert is shown in Fig. 5. Subsequently, the base sequence of pRGE is compared with that of pHGE to investigate the homology and consensus sequence around the boundary between intron and exon.

Step 14 Synthesis of oligodeoxyhucleotides To a stainless steel 500 l reaction vessel with stainless steel filters at each enc is added 20 mg of a polystyrene resin to which a nucleoside 2.0 zM is connected via a succinate linkage. The resin is treated with zinC bromide 1 M in dichloromethane isopropanol 85 15 to remove the dimethoxytrityl DMT protecting group, washed with dimethylformamide, pyridine, and acetonitrile, and dried with a stream of nitrogen. To the dried resin is added a solution of DMT nucleotide 20 pM and mesitylenesulfonylnitrotriazo le 60 M in 200 l pyridine. The coupling reaction is allowed to proceed at 45 C for 20 minutes.This cycle of deprotaction end coupling is repeated for successive nucleotides until the desired oligodeoxynucleotide is assembled on the resin. The resin is then treated to remove the oligodeoxynucleotide therefrom and purified as described by Ito, Ike, Ikuta, and Itakura Nuc. Ac. Res. 10 1755 1982 . Thus, the following oligodeoxynucleotides are obtained. 1 5 AATTCATGTCATCTTCTCGAACCCCGAGTGACAA 3 2 3 GTACAGTAGAAGAGCTTGGGGCTCACTGTTCGG 5 3 5 GCCTGTAGCCCATGTTGTAGCAAACCCTCAAGC 3 4 3 ACATCGGGTACAACATCGTTTGGGAGTTCGACT 5 Step 15 Construction of M13mp9 HGE containing the human minigene for TNF plasmid pHGE 10 yg is digested with EcoRI 20 units .After electrophoresis on a 1 low melting agarose gel, the 2.9 kb fragment is eluted. This fragment is inserted into EcoRI fragment from the replicative form of M13mp9 phage. The M13mp9 phage is selected because it is especially suited for receiving sections of DNA. The product transfects to E. coli JM103 BRL Bethesda Research Laboratories, Inc., U.S.A. Usar Manual M13mp7 Cloning Dideoxy sequencing, 1980 . The product is designated M13mp9 HGE. Step 16 Deletion of Intron 3, using M13mp9 HGE single strand DNA and Deleter E3 4 3 The single strand DNA of M13mp9 HGE is prepared by the method of BRL User Manual M13mp7 cloning Dideoxy sequencing, 1980. Oligodeoxynucleotide 4 3 ACATCGGGTACAACATCGTTTGGGAGTTCGACT 5 prepared in Step 14 is used as a deleter for the intron 3.The deleter for the intron 3 is designated E3 4 . The deletes E3 4 has 2 base sequence which is complementary to the base sequence of the bases before Exon 3 and after Exon 4 the intron 3 which is to be deleted. Deletion of the intron 3 is effected, in accordance with the teaching or Wallace et al, Science 209 1396 1980 , as follows. E3 4 164 ng, 15 pmole is phosphorylated using T4 kinase 10 units and ATP 3mE1 and added to the templateM13mp9 HGE 1.65 g. 0.5 pmole . The reaction mixture is heated at 650C for 10 minutes, cooled to room temperature for 5 minutes , and finally cooled in ice water. To dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP and ATP 0.4 mM , is added Klenow fragment 5 units , T4 lipase 10 units in Bin buffer Wallace et al, Nuc. Ac. Res. 9 3647 1981 , 10 mM Tris EC1 pH 7.2 , 2 mM MgCl2 and lmM ss mercaptoethanol.The reaction mixture final volume 50 l is incubated for 30 minutes at 40C and then for 30 minutes at room temperature. The DNA from the oligonucleotide primed reaction is used to transfect E. coli JM103 in accordance with the procedure of BRL User Manual M13mp7 cloning Dideoxy sequencing, 1980. Plaques obtained in this way are picked to iT plates J.H. Miller, p. 433, Experiments in Molecular Genetics,Cold Spring Barbor Laboratory 1972 . The colonies obtained are hybridized at 550C for 2 hours with 32P labelled E3 4. For this step, the deleter is used as a probe to identify sequences of DNA having the corresponding complementary base sequence after the intron has been deleted. Phage are isolated from those colonies which hybridize with the deleter. The resultant phage are plated and plaques are picked to YT plates. The clones are allowed to hybridize at 550C for 2 hours with 32P labelled E3 4. Positive clones are obtained and the phage DNA is sequenced to select those phage in which intron 3 is completeiy deleted. One such phage is designated mp9 HGE 3 1. Step 17 Construction of pHTNF lacUV5 2 The replicative form of mp9 HGE 3 1 is digested with EcoRI. The E oRI fragment is isolated and cloned toEcoRI cleaved pBR327 to yield the plasmid pHGE 3 1. Construction of further plasmid is carried out using plasmid pHGE A 3 1 in order to obtain such plasmid a 3 1 as will directly express TNF in E. coli using lac UV5 as 2 promoter.The procedures are illustratively shown in Fig. 7. First, 10 g of plasmid pHGE 3 1 is digested with 10 units ofAvaI and EcoRI manufactured and sold by Bethesda ResearchLaboratories, Inc., U.S.A. . at 370C for two hours and electrophoresed on a 4 by weight polyacrylamide gel to isolate fragments.About 1 g of fragment is isolated from the gel by electroelution. In the same manner as in Step 14, two oligodeoxynucleotides shown in Fig. 7, namely 5 AATTCATGTCATCTTCTCGAACC 3 and 5 TCGGGGTTCGAGAAGATGACATG 3 are synthesized Then, each 5 end of the two oligodeoxynucleotides about 100 pmole is phosphorylated using T4 polynucleotide kinase in accordance with the method described in Literature 3 , page 122. After completion of the re ction, the reaction mixture is extracted with phenol and then with chloroform.Then the so obtained synthatic oligomers are mixed with 0.5 g of the previously obtained Aval EcoRI fragment from plasmid pHGE 3 1 and ethanol precipitated. These fragments are ligated at 4 C overnight using 10 units of T4 ligese in accordance with the procedure described in Literature 1 , page 37. After completion of the reaction, the mixture is ethanol precipitated, followed by electrophoresis effected on a 4 by weight polyacrylamide gel to recover fragment by el ectroelution. In accordance with the procedure described in F. Fuller, Gene , 19, pp. 42 54 1982 , plasmid pOP95 15 is prepared. One pg of pOP 5 15 is digested with EcoRI and extracted with phenol and then with chloroform, followed by ethanol precipitation to obtain a vector. Using T4 DNA liaise, 0.5 g of the obtained vector is ligated with the above obtained fragment. In accordance with the procedure described inLiterature 4 , page 20, E. coli JXlDl ATCC 33876 is transformed using the above obtained vector and cultivated on an agar medium containing 1 mM of IPTG and o.oo 4 w7v x gal to obtain about 100 white colonies. Plasmid DNA is prepared from these transformants and digested with EcoPJ to identify those plasmids containing the intended EcoRI fragment. In order to examine the direction of insertion, those plasmids are digested with PvuII and PstI and electrophoresed on a 1.5 t by weight agarose gel to select plasmids yielding fragments of about 1280 base pairs and about 2600 base pairs indicating that the direction of transcription of the lac UV5 promoter is in agreement with those of the oligodeoxynucleotides coding for TNF. Base sequence analysis shows that these 2 plasmids have t same sequence and that the lac EV5 promotoer, the synthesized oligodeoxynucleotide and DNn are properly combined with each other. The obtained plasmids is designated pHTNF lacUV5 2. E. coli containing pHTNF lacUV5 2 is cultured in a conventional nutrient medium. Bioassay of the product forTNF activity indicates almost the same activity whihc is obtained with a plasmid pTNF lacUV5 1 containing the rabbitTNF gene under control of the lac promoter.Referential Example 3 Using the plasmid pHGE and oligodeoxynucleotides 1 to 4 obtained by the procedure described in Steps 1 to 14 ofReferential Example 2, pHTNF lacW5 1 is prepared in accordance with the procedure illustrated in Fig. 6. Example 1 E.coli containing pHTNF lacUV5 2 prepared inReferential Example 3 is cultured in a conventional nutrient medium and subjected to induction according to a customary method. The E.coli is further cultured to obtain cells of E.coli containing the physiologically active substance to be used in the present inventionThe cells are collected by centrifugation and subjected to cell lysis by sonication in 1 Q of 0.04 M Tris HCl buffer pH 7.8 to obtain a cell extract containing the physiologically active substance. The cell extract exhibits a cytotoxic activity of 4.5 x 105 U ml.A specific activity of the active substance in the extract is 3.0 x 104 U mg protein. Then, the extract is applied to a DEAE SepharoseCL 6B manufactured by Pharmacia Fine Chemicals AB,Sweden column sufficiently equilbrated with 0.04 MTris HCl buffer pH 8.0 . The column is washed with 0.04 M Tris HCl buffer pH 8.0 and, thereafter, the elution is effected using 0.04 M Tris HCl buffer pH 8.0 containing 0.1 M NaCl. Active fractions are pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration, thereby to obtain a crude solution containing the active substance having a specific activity of 4.0 x 105 U mgprotein. The thus obtained crude solution is applied on a Sephacryl S 200 manufactured by Pharmacia FineChemicals AB, Sweden column equilibrated with 5 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4 containing 0.15 M NaCl, followed by gel filtration using the same buffer.Active fractions are pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration, thereby to obtain a solution containing the physiologically active substance having a specific activity of 7.0 x 105 U mg protein. An aliquot of the obtained solution is diluted with 5 mto phosphate buffer pH 7.4 containing 0.15 M NaCl to prepare a solution of the physiologically active substance having a cytoxic activity of 120 U ml. To aliquots of the thus obtained solution is separately added each of HSA human serum albumin and BSA Bovine serum albumin to form sample solutions having albumin concentrations as indicated in Table 5.For each of the resulting sample solutions, the remaining activity is determined with respect to the samples which are respectively subjected to storing for 2 days, 7 days and 30 days at 4 C. In carrying out the above test, the active substance solution in which no albumin is incorporated is used as control. To determine the remaining activity, the activity of each sample is assayed in vitro or in vivo, according to the methods as described hereinbefore. In the in vitro method, the remaining activity t is calculated from the assay value according to the following equation Remaining activity A B x 100 wherein A is the cytotoxic activity of the sample after storing or physical treatment and B is the cytotoxic activity of the sample before storing or physical treatment In the in vivo method, each sample solution is concentrated to have a concentration 20 times that at start by means of the Mini Module NM 3 trade mark of the ultra filtration equipment manufactured byAsahi Chemical Industry Co. Ltd., Japan and sold byFunakoshi Yakuhin, Japan .Then, 0.5 ml of each of the thus concentrated TNF solutions is injected, through the tail vein, into each of a group of five tumor bearing mice. The antitumor activity was assayed 24 hours later in accordance with the criterion as described hereinbefore. The results obtained are shown inTable S and Fig. 8. Example 2 Substantially the same procedures as in example 1 are repeated to prepare sample solutions as described in Example 1. For each of the solutions, the remaining activity is determined with respect to i the samples respectively subjected to one cycle and three cycles of freezing 70 CC and thawing and ii the samples subjected to freezing at 70 C, lyophilization and storing at room temperature for 7 days. In carrying out the above test, the active substance solution containing no albumin is used as control. With respect to the lyophilized preparation see ii above , it is dissolved in sterile distilled water and then subjected to assay of the cytotoxic activity. The remaining activity of each sample is assayed in vivo or in vitro as in Example 1. The results are shown in Table 5.Comparative Example To aliquots of the human TNF solution having the same cytotoxic activity as that employed in Example 1, each of various amino acids, metal salts and chelating agents, which are well known stabilizing agents for the solutions of ordinary physiologically active substances, is separately added in a varied concentration, as shown in Table 6. Each of the resulting solutions is stored at 4 OC for 7 days, and subjected to the assay of the antitumor activity according to the in vivo assay method. The remaining activity is calculated in the same manner as in Example 1. The results are shown in Table 6.
