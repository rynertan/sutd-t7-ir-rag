# Control circuit for electronic flash.

## Abstract
A control circuit for timing the duration of a flash of artificial illumination from an electronic flash maintains a substantially uniform amount of artificial illumination re gardless of the ambient scene light intensity by detecting the ambient scene light intensity up to the instant that the flash is fired and thereafter subtracting the ambient scene light intensity so detected immediately prior to the flash being fired from the ambient and artificial scene light intensity detected during the flash of artificial illumination.
