## Description
SILAGE PRESERVATION WITH PROPIONIC ACID PRODUCING MICROORGANISMS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention Silage can be defined as the product formed when grass crops such as alfalfa, wheat, rye and timothy, or grain crops such as corn, maize and sorghum, susceptible to spoilage by aerobic microorganisms, are stored under anaerobic conditions and un.dergo fermentation, for use as winter feed for ruminants. The major objective in the ensiling process is to preserve the material with a minimum loss of dry matter and of nutrients. There are three types of fermentation which can take place in silage i lactic fermentation ii secondary clostridial fermentation which can occur both during and or after the lactic fermentation and iii the fermentation which occurs under aerobic conditions, when a silo is opened for feeding socalled after fermentation . The latter is not a true fermentation, but an aerobic microbial degredation of residual sugars and lactic acid. In the natural ensiling process, acid forming bacteria present in the silage crop ferment the water soluble carbohydrates WSC present, e.g., glucose, fructose and sucrose, to a mixture of acetic and lactic acids, predominantly lactic acid. The acetic and lactic acids reduce the pH to about 4.0. The process is basically a lactic acid fermentation and the silage can remain stable for months if air is excluded. Thus successful fermentation depends upon a rapid decline in pH and a high concentration of lactic acid. To ensure that fermentation proceeds properly, lactic acid bacteria may be added to a fresh grass or grain, usually at the time of harvesting. Accompanying the fermentation of the WSC are a wide range of other biochemical activities some of which are undesirable, e.g., growth of aerobic microorganisms, such as yeasts and molds and oxidative plant enzymes. Immediately after harvesting, plant enzymes are active and these, together with the growth of aerobic microorganisms, continue until anaerobic conditions are achieved and the pH of the mass decreases. If the pH of the silage is too high, rapid and extensive proteolysis takes place, in which the protein is broken down to amino acids, ammonia, carbon dioxide and amines, by clostridia bacteria present. In addition, conversion of lactate and orWSC to butyrate by clostridia bacteria results in the spoilage of silage. A rapid decrease in pH, i.e., a pH decrease from about 6.1 to about 4.4 within 3 days after storage is desirable. This rate of pH decrease appears to allow lactic acid and other fatty acids to predominate and inhibit the growth of undesirable microorganisms such as yeast and mold Too rapid a pH decrease, i.e., a decrease in pH to about 4.4 within 2 days after storage is undesirable, and can be detrimental because of the possibility of preserving yeasts and molds, which then become extremely active under aerobic conditions when the silo is opened for feeding, the so called after fermentation. Prevention of phase iii type fermentation has been difficult to achieve 2.Description of the Prior Art Because a properly controlled pH decrease arrests development of undesirable aerobe microorganisms, various methods for producing controlled decrease in the pH of silage have been suggested. One method is to acidify the silage with a mineral acid, e.g., phosphoric or hydrochloric acid, or with an organic acid such as formic or propionic acid. SeeJ. Dairy Sci. 63 587 593 1980 and J. Stored Prod. Revs., 14 25 33 1978 . As indicated earlier, after fermentation has occurred during anaerobic storage and the silo is opened, the silage will be exposed to aerobic conditions which will foster its deterioration phase iii . This deterioration is indicated by loss of nutrient availability, surface mold growth and feed refusal by the animals, and can result in substantial economic losses. This deterioration is believed to be due to yeasts and fungi which can utilize the lactic acid present in the silage as a substrate. It has been suggested that the aerobic deterioration of silage can be prevented or retarded by addition of propionic acid. See J. Sci Fd Agric 26 1137 1147 1975 . The authors noted that beneficial effects of propionate addition were found in some cases, but that in other cases fairly large amounts of propionic acid did not prevent deterioration. No explanation was presented for this contradictory finding. J. Sci Fd Agric 26 219 228 1975 indicated that at a pH of 4, formic, acetic and propionic acids become inhibitory to yeasts and molds, However, in a study described in Mycopathologia 69 153 156 1979 directed to aerobic deterioration of wheat and alfalfa silages, the authors investigated the inhibition of yeasts in silage in the presence of lactic and propionic acid. The authors state that lactic and prop ionic acids may not have an inhibitory effect even at 3 concentration on yeasts responsible for aerobic deterioration of silage. The authors conclude it is unlikely that the silage additives suggested in the prior art, i.e. C1 C12 fatty acids, eg. formic, acetic and propionic acid can control aerobic deterioration of silage. In view of this contradictory prior art as to the beneficial effect of the addition of prop ionic acid to silage, and in view of the difficulty entailed with the handling of such a corrosive acid to avoid hazards to personnel and to farming equipment, the use of propionic acid for prevention of aerobic deterioration of silage has not been recognized by the prior art as commercially feasible. A widely utilized method of decreasing the pH of the crop during the ensiling process involves inoculating the silage with lactic acid producing microorganisms see U.S. Patent No. 4,210,673. Various silage inoculants incorporating Lactobacillus micro , organisms are available commercially. Another method involves inoculating the silage with microorganisms which excrete amylase, protease or cellulase, to increase the soluble carbohydrate content, thus enabling the natural lactic acid bacteria present to produce lactic acid at a faster rate. Examples of microorganisms suggested are LactobacilZus acido philus, L. pZantarum, L. brevis, Streptococcus faecium, S. faecalis, S. cremoris, S. diacetylactis, AspergiZZus niger, and A. oryzae. LactobaciZZus ptantarum has been widely used as a silage inoculant. Herbage Abstracts, 42 2 105 111 1972 indicates that L. plantarum is slow to produce lactic acid until the pH is under 5.0, and suggests the need for an additional lactic acid producing microorganism. Streptococcus faecalis is recommended. The prior art has not proposed a convenient treatment to avoid the disadvantages of chemical treatment and at the same time to ensure protection of the silage during both anaerobic storage and during the aerobic conditions encountered in feeding silage. The present invention provides a method for the efficacious preservation of silage, to prevent spoilage of the silage during anaerobic storage and under aerobic conditions when the silage is fed to ruminants. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to a method for controlling the fermentation of a grass or grain crop to produce silage. The method involves applying to the grass or grain crop prop ionic acid producing microorganisms. The propionic acid producing microorganisms can be applied in conjunction with lactic acid producing microorganisms. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Propionic acid producing microorganisms suitable for use in the present invention include Propionibacterium acidipropionici ATCC 25562 , P. jensenii ATCC 4964 , P. freudenreichii. subspecies lobosum ATCC 6207 , P. freudenreichii subspecies shermenii ATCC 8262 , Propionibacterium freudenreichii ATCC 31781 , Propionibacterium acidipropinoici ATCC 31782 , Megasphaera elsdenii NRRL 11052 and Selenomonas ruminantium NRRL 11051 . Commercially available lactic acid bacteria which can be used in various combinations with these propionic acid producing bacteria listed below, along with their ATCC deposit numbers are Lactobacillus plantarum 14917 , L. delbruckii 9649 , L. Zeich manii 4797 , L. Zactis 12315 , L. bulgaricus 11842 ,L. helveticus 15009 , L. acidophiZus 4356 , L. xylosus 16577 , L. casei 7469 , L. fermentum 14931 ,L. brevis 14869 , L. curuatus 25601 , Streptococcus faecium 19434 , S. faecalis 19433 , S. lactis 19435 , S. cremoris 19257 , S. thermophiZus 19258 and Pediococcus acidiZactici 25742 . The microorganisms of the present invention can be applied to the grass or grain crop either shortly before harvesting or immediately subsequent to harvesting. The microorganisms can be applied as a dry powder, e.g., in conjunction with a dry powder diluent, for ease of application. Alternately, the microorganisms can be added to a liquid diluent and applied as a solution. A useful range of application rate is from about 1 x 104 to about 1 x 109 of prop ionic acid producing microorganisms per gram of grass or grain crop. If it is desired to use lactic acid producing microorganisms in combination with prop ionic acid producing microorganisms, each can be present in an amount within this range. Based on cost benefit considerations, a lower amount of the above microorganism range is desirable, for example, from about 1 x 104 to 1 x 107 microorganisms per gram. Application at a higher rate per gram of crop is economically disadvantageous. Application of propionic acid producing microorganisms or a combination of lactic acid producing microorganisms in the range described above produces a pH decrease in the silage from about 6.2 to about 4.4 within 3 days after storage under anaerobic conditions. This rate of pH decrease has been found to provide desirable levels of lactic fermentation phase i and prevent clostridial fermentation phase ii while at the same time greatly improve the stability of the silage on exposure to air phase iii . The method and microorganisms of the present invention were evaluated as described in the following examples. EXAMPLE 1 Corn was harvested and ensiled for use as corn silage by inoculating the corn with a prop ionic acidproducing bacterium culture Propionibacterium freu denreichii, subspecies shermenfi, ATCC 8262 commercially available from Miles Laboratories, Inc.,Elkhart, Indiana, at a level of 1.6 x 109 microorganisms per gram of corn. The culture was applied as an aqueous suspension. A total of 18.16 kg of corn was compressed into a series of individual packages to a density of 0.8 g cm3. The inoculated packages were packed into 5 gallon pails and sealed air tight to obtain anaerobic conditions and to simulate silo storage conditions The packages were removed periodical ly and a sample for testing prepared by the following method. A 50 gram portion of each package was suspended in 500 ml of sterilized distilled water and mixed with a blender for about 3 minutes. The resulting suspension was immediately sampled for determination of titratable acid and pH. Control samples of corn silage, which were not treated with propionic acidproducing bacterium culture were prepared and tested along with inoculated samples Results obtained are summarized below. TABLE 1 Titratable Acid meqLg UntreatedDay Control Inoculated 0 1.45 1.38 3 2028 2.88 6 3 96 3 .67 15 3.52 21 2.83 589 Titratable acidity is considered an indication of the amount of microbial activity in the silage.During the initial stages of the ensiling process, i.e., up to about 3 to 6 days, both the inoculated samples and control samples had similar titratable acidity. After 3 days, higher amounts of titratable acidity have a buffer effect, which helps to prevent the pH from changing increasing significantly.The higher titratable acidity of the inoculated sample after 21 days storage compared to the titratable acidity of the untreated control samples, indicates significant improvement in anaerobic storage stability. EXAMPLE 2 For dry matter determination, approximately 10 g of the crop described in Example 1 was placed in preweighed aluminum cans and the total weight determined.The cans were then placed in a vacuum oven and dried at 105 C overnight. The cans were removed from the oven, cooled in a desiccator and weighed to a constant weight. The dry matter DM content was determined by the equation DM full weight after drying empty can weight full weight before drying empty can weight t A 40 pound sample of corn was inoculated with 50 ml of a culture suspension with the microorganisms ofExample 1, which resulted in an application level of 1.6 x 109 microorganisms per gram of corn The dry matter was measured initially and after 21 days storage under anaerobic conditions. The dry matter loss was obtained by calculating the difference between the 21 day storage value and the original dry matter value and dividing the difference by the original dry matter value. The results obtained are summarized below in Table 2. TABLE 2 Dry Matter Loss Untreated Control InoculatedOriginal Dry Matter 28 27.7 21 Day Storage Anaerobic 26.55 26.58Dry Matter Loss 5..u 4.04 The test results shown in Table 2 indicate that inoculation of the corn with prop ionic acid producing microorganisms reduces the loss of dry matter which occurs during the ensiling process, i.eO, anaerobic storage. This reduction of dry matter loss provides more utilizable silage feed from a given amount of crop ensiled. The above test results indicate that propionic acid producing microorganisms are effective in corn silage production. Because of the economic importance of grass crops as silage, and the potential for economic losses which can occur as a result of deterioration of the silage under anaerobic conditions, the method of silage preservation of the present invention was tested on alfalfa. EXAMPLE 3 As described hereinbefore, lactic acid producing microorganisms have long been utilized in silage fermentation, especially to improve lactic fermentation. Also described hereinbefore were prior art studies involving the use of propionic acid treatment of silage. The following experiments were conducted to demonstrate the effect of the use of prop ionic acid producing microorganisms in conjunction with lactic acid producing microorganisms on stability of silage after anaerobic storage, and to compare such use with an untreated control and with the application of a propionic acid solution to the crop. Four prop ionic acid producing cultures of microorganisms identified below were mixed individually with Lactobacillus plantarum at a 1 1 cell number ratio. Alfalfa was cut in midbloom, wilted to about 30 DM and inoculated at a level of 1 x 107 microorganisms g strain. The inoculated alfalfa was packed in 30 gallon drums and 5 gallon pails. Anaerobic conditions were obtained by placing sand filled bags on top of the alfalfa before covering the drums and pails with tight fitting lids. Control samples of untreated alfalfa and alfalfa sprayed with prop ionic acid at a final concentration of 0.5 percent v w were packed in pails and aerated after 21 days. After 21 days storage under anaerobic conditions, the drums were opened and the silage placed into small pails and thoroughly aerated, to simulate the conditions which occur after anaerobic treatment of silage when a silo is opened for feeding. The samples were periodically tested for mold and yeast counts after exposure to air. The yeast and mold counts can be determined by the conventional method of plating out a given amount of sample on a selective agar plate and counting the colony forming units CFU , expressed as the log CFU ml . The test results obtained are summarized inTable 3 below.

Treatment of the silage with the mixed microoganism cultures of num 1, num 2, num 3 and num 4 effectively lowered the yeast and mold growth present in the silage during anaerobic storage, as indicated by the data for day 0. Because aerobic exposure during feeding usually does not exceed about 3 to 4 days, it is important that yeast and mold growth are inhibited during this period. The test data indicates excellent inhibition of yeast and mold growth up to day 5 of aerobic exposure subsequent to day 5, samples 1, 2, 3 and 4 began to exhibit a somewhat erratic increase in yeast and mold counts. Visual observation of the silage after 9 days exposure to air indicated that treatmentl L. pbantarum and Propionibacterium jensenii and num 4 L.plantarum and Propionibacterium freudenreichii were most effective no visible growth of mold or yeast spots was present on the surface. Treatment num 2 L. ptantarum and Propionibacterium acidipropionici and num 3 L. pZantarum and Megaspharea eZsendii had pockets of mold on the surface, but this did not represent serious degradation. In contrast, the untreated control and the control treated with prop ionic acid solution were both covered with heavy mold growth.The control silage was considered spoiled on day 5, while silage treated according to the present invention was stable after 9 days exposure. These test results indicate that a mixture of prop ionic acid producing and lactic acid producing microorganisms is efficacious in preventing yeast and mold caused deterioration of silage under aerobic conditions even though prop ionic acid solution appeared to accelerate yeast and mold growth during anaerobic and aerobic storage. As indicated earlier, conversion of lactate and or WSC to butyrate by clostridia bacteria present results in spoilage of silage, The clostridia population in silage, therefore, usually provides an indication of the extent of deterioration of the silage under anaerobic conditions. The test results showing the clostridia bacteria population during anaerobic storage are summarized below in Table 4 TABLE 4Alfalfa Clostridia Counts Anaerobic Storage cells gram UntreatedControl num 1 num 2 num 3 num 4Day 0 5.6 5.62Day 1 8.49 8.04 8.63 8.15 7.92 8.60 7.23 8.52 8.23 9.02Day 2 8.51 7.63 8.52 7.04 7.58 8.69 7.06 8.49 7.16 6.97Day 3 8.55 6.95 7.54 6.89 7.20 8.54 7.39 7.48 6.59 6.68Day 4 8.49 6.68 7.23 6.65 6.88 8.63 7.25 7.54 6.59 6.69Day 7 8.21 6.55 7.31 6.54 6.64 7.84 7.12 7.48 6.58 6.39Day 14 8.11 6.30 7.25 6.43 6.26 6.98 6.88 7.56 6.41 6.42Day 21 7.18 6.79 6.71 5.76 5.90 6.19 6.61 6.80 5.85 5.69Terminal 6.53 6.28 6.48 6.26 5.64 7.08 6.02 6.41 6.04 5.91 The microbial cultures containing the prop ionic acid producing microorganisms produced a more rapid inhibition of clostridia bacteria than was obtained in untreated control samples.
