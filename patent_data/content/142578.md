# A method of encapsulating gases, vapors, complexes and ions in solids.

## Abstract
A clay material of the polygorskite group, pretreated or not, is degassed and contacted with a gas to be adsorbed and after adsorption the clay is heated while in contact with the gas so that the clay structure collapses, encapsulating the adsorbed gas. If desired the entrances of the pores may be narrowed to a desired size by adsorption of diborane before the adsorption of the gas.
