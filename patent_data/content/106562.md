## Description
SOLID MICROBIOCIDAL COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS FOR SAFENINGISOTHIAZOLONE MICROBIOCIDES AND CONTROLLING LIVINGMICROORGANISMS This invention is concerned with solid microbiocidal compositions and methods for safening isothiazolones microbiocides and controlling living microorganisms.Microbiocidal compounds of special interest are 3 isothiazolones and 2 substituted 1,2 benzisothiazolones hereafter isothiazolones , which have a known tendency to impart skin irritancy to man and to evolve nontoxic gases when provided in aqueous solution at concentrations convenient for shipping. The isothiazolones are a class of chemical compounds known to possess excellent and useful microbiocidal properties and resistance to common additives and contaminants. Many 3 isothiazolones are disclosed in U.S.Patents 3,761,488 3,849,430, 3,870,795 4,067,878 4,150,026 and 4,241,214. U.S. Patents 3,517,022 3,065,123 and 3,761,489 disclose 2 substituted 1,2 benzisothiazolones.U.S. Patent 3,849,430 discloses a method for preparing the isothiazolones. While these patent specifications disclose the use of isothiazolones in a variety of microbiocidal end uses such as, for example, those uses and formulations and compositions disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,761,488 at columns 15 19 and in,the actual examples thereafter, isothiazolones are generally made available in combination with a liquid carrier suchas water or in aqueous compositions. Column 19, line 66 et Âµeq. discloses that isothiazolones can be taken up or mixed with a finely divided particled solid carrier, as for example, clays, inorganic silicates, carbonates, silicas and organic carriers. Column 20, line 25 et seq. discloses that a convenient method for preparing a solid formulation is to impregnate the isothiazolone toxicant onto the solid carrier by means of a volatile solvent, such as acetone.However, attempts to produce solid formulations have resulted in formulations which tended to coalesce or cake or to give extremely lightweight particles or dusts . U.S. Patent 4,011,172 discloses chlorine bleaching compounds dissolved in water or other suitable solvent thickened by the addition of particulate thickening agent, for example, silicate materials, water swellable and water soluble polyacrylamides and cellulose derivatives, and synthetic clays, the thickened bleaching compounds being contained in a perforated pouch made of plastics material. Isothiazolones are commonly provided in commerce in aqueous solution, usually with inorganic, alkaline earth metal salts as stabilizers to prevent reactions which render them less active to microorganisms. Although solid alkaline earth metal salt complexes are known U.S. Patents 4,150,026 and 4,241,214 mentioned above , these salt complexes suffer the disadvantage that they badly corrode processing equipment used to remove water in the course of producing the solid dry salt complex product, and the final solid salt complex product tends to be extremely dusty and thereby toxic to one during handling the product. A typical, useful commercially available 3 isothiazolone product is Kathon 886 Rohm and HaasCompany , a metal salt stabilized aqueous solution of 5 chloro 2 methyl 3 isothiazolone and 2 methyl 3 isothiazolone 3 1 containing 14 active ingredient and Mg NO3 2 plus MgC12 as stabilizers.Such commercial products suffer the disadvantages of being irritating to the skin when spilled during handling and evolving nontoxic gases which build up pressure in sealed containers used in shipping and transportation. It has been found that these disadvantages can be overcome by providing water soluble microbiocidal compounds, especially 3 isothiazolones, in the form of dry solid compositions. This invention provides a particulate solid microbiocidal composition useful in aqueous systems comprising a 0.1 70 weight , based on total weight of said composition, of water soluble microbiocidal compound and b about 99.9 30 weight , based on total weight of said composition, of solid carrier material. Preferably, in the particulate solid microbiocidal composition, microbiocidal compound a comprises water soluble microbiocidally effective isothiazolone, having a water solubility of about 1000 ppm or greater, at room temperature 250C of the formula EMI3.1 wherein Y is an unsubstituted or substituted C1 C18 alkyl group, an unsubstituted or substituted C2 C18 alkenyl or alkynyl group, an unsubstituted or substituted C3 C12 cycloalkyl group, an unsubstituted or substituted aralkyl group of 6 10 carbon atoms, or an unsubstituted or substituted aryl group of 6 10 carbon atoms R is hydrogen, halogen or a C1 C4 alkyl group R is hydrogen, halogen or a C1 C4 alkyl group or R and R can be taken together with the C C bond of the isothiazolone ring to form an unsubstituted or substituted benzene ring or said isothiazolone s stabilized with metal salt in an amount of 1 60 weight , based on weight of isothiazolone and metal salt, said metal salt s being representd by the formula bEn wherein M is a cation of sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, copper, iron, zinc, barium, manganese, silver, cobalt and or nickel X is chloride, bromide, iodide, sulfate, nitrate, nitrite, acetate, chlorate, perchlorate, sulfate, bicarbonate, oxalate, maleate, p toluene sulfonate, carbonate, and or phosphate and n is an integer for which the anion X satisfies the valence of the cation M and said solid carrier material b comprises inert finely divided water insoluble solid material selected from silicaceous diatomaceous earth, high water absorption capacity calcium silicate granular material, charcoal, clays, vermiculite, corn cobs high purity silica e.g.Aerosil and Sipernet and wood. It is to be understood that, as the number of carbon atoms in the substituent group 1iy increases and as halogens are substituted on the isothiazolone ring, water solubility decreases. By a substituted alkyl group is meant an alkyl group having one or more of its hydrogens replaced by another substituent group. Examples of the substituted alkyl groups which characterize the isothiazolones preferably used in this invention include hydroxyalkyl, haloalkyl, cyanoalkyl, alkylamino, dialkylamino, arylaminoalkyl, carboxyalkyl, carbalkoxyalkyl, alkoxyalkyl, aryloxyalkyl, alkylthioalkyl, arylthioalkyl, haloalkoxyalkyl, cycloaminoalkyl such as morpholinylalkyl and piperidinylalkyl and pyrrolodinylalkyl, carbamoxyalkyl, alkenyl, haloalkenyl, alkynyl, haloalkynyl and isothiazolonylalkyl. By a substituted aralkyl group is meant an aralkyl group having one or more of the hydrogens on either the aryl ring or the alkyl chain replaced by another substituent group. Examples of the substituted aralkyl group which characterize the isothiazolones preferably used in this invention include halo, lower i.e. C1 to C8 preferablyC1 to C4 alkyl and lower alkoxy. By a substituted aryl group and substituted benzene ring is meant an aryl group and benzene ring, respectively, such as phenyl, naphthyl, or pyridyl groups, having one or more of the hydrogens on the aryl ring replaced by another substituent group. Examples of such substituent groups include halo, nitro, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, lower alkyl and acylamino, lower carbalkoxy and sulfonyl. By the expression water soluble as applied to the isothiazolones used in this invention is meant an isothiazolone or combination of isothiazolones characterized by having a water solubility of about 1000 ppm 0.1 or greater at room temperature 250C . Highly water soluble isothiazolones can have a solubility even as high as from 150,000 ppm to nearly infinitely soluble. By the expression microbiocidal compound is meant those compounds effective to control those microorganisms, especially of the group of bacteria, fungi including molds and yeasts , and algae. In the method of the invention for controlling living microorganisms, by the expression microorganisms is meant bacteria, fungi, and algae. When used alone, the expression 11isothiazolones is meant to include the free isothiazolones and the metal salt complexes of the free isothiazolones. More preferably, the composition of the invention comprises a 1 35 weight , based on total weight of said composition, of said isothiazolone wherein Y is an unsubstituted or substituted C1 C18 alkyl group or C3 C12 cycloalkyl group R is hydrogen or halogen R is hydrogen or halogen or R and R are taken together with he C C bond of the 3 isothiazolone ring to form a benzene ring or said isothiazolone stabilized with said metal salt and b 99 65 weight , based on total weight of said composition, of solid carrier material selected from silicaceous diatomaceous earth, high water absorption capacity calcium silicate granular material, and clays. Most preferably, the composition of the invention comprises a 2 25 weight , based on total weight of said composition, of said isothiazolone wherein Y is methyl, R is hydrogen and R is chlorine or of a mixture of said isothiazolones in aqueous solution wherein Y is methyl, R is hydrogen and R is chlorine and Y is methyl, R is hydrogen and R is hydrogen or said isothiazolone s stabilized with said metal salt wherein said metal salt is Mg NO3 2 or a mixture of Mg NO3 2 and MgC12 and b 98 75 weight , based on total weight of said composition, of silicaceous diatomaceous earth. By way of example, there may be used in combination with the above defined most preferred, or more preferred, isothiazolones, isothiazolone s having a water solubility of about 500 ppm at room temperature wherein Y is n octyl or t octyl and R and R are both hydrogen, providing, of course, that the water solubility of the combination is 1000 ppm or greater. Another aspect of the invention is a method for controlling living microorganisms in an aqueous system which comprises incorporating into the aqueous system an amount of the composition of the invention sufficient to provide in the aqueous system a microbiocidally effective amount of said microbiocidal compound. Yet another aspect of the invention is a method for safening microbiocidal isothiazolone compounds which comprises admixing aqueous or inert organic solvent solutions containing amounts of said isothiazolones or said isothiazolones stabilized with metal salt which are irritating to man with inert finely divided water insoluble solid carrier material to afford a non dusting, flowable, stable, non irritating solid formulation or composition of the microbiocidal compound convenient for handling and transporting. The microbiocidal compsitions according to the invention can afford several advantages. One such advantage is that the composition is a flowable, stable, non irritating form of a microbiocidal composition, especially of an isothiazolone composition. This solid form is more convenient for handling, transporting, and shipping.Moreover, this solid form is safer in that it diminishes the chance of inadvertent, accidental exposure to the skin of the skin irritating isothiazolones during the course of handling. Further, in the event of contact with the skin, this solid form can be detected more readily and can then be removed before isothiazolone can leach from the solid to effect skin irritance. Further, in the preparation of the solid microbiocidal composition, an aqueous solution of the isothiazolones obtained in the production thereof can be absorbed onto the solid carrier material, so that no drying to remove, or evaporate, the water is required in order to obtain a flowable solid product. We have also found that, whereas it has been observed that aqueous solutions of isothiazolones are avantageously stabilized by metal salt, for example, magnesium salts, in the ratio of two equivalents of magnesium per equivalent of isothiazolone, here, in the solid compositions, the metal salt may still be effective in other stoichiometric amounts, especially in ratios less than two equivalents of metal per equivalent of isothiazolone, without restricting the stability of the isothiazolone. The solid microbiocidal composition can be advantageously used in a variety of aqueous systems, such as, for example, in treating oil field waters, treating oil well drilling muds, as a dispersant for clay mining, as a component in cosmetic compositions, and in other aqueous systems in which the presence of freely dispersed, finely divided solid matter is of no concern or detriment. Accordingly this invention, in one aspect, is directed to a method of making industrially useful aqueous systems with incorporated biostalic or biocidal properties. In treating oil field waters and oil well drilling muds, a liquid form of a microbiocidal compound, such as, for example, Kathon 886 Rohm and Haas Company commonly is transferred from a shipping container to a smaller container, such as a lid less bucket, and the open bucket filled with Kathon 886 is carried to the use site, such as a water tower, and up a ladder and emptied into the water tower. By substituting the solid composition of this invention for the liquid composition described above, problems of spillage and detection of spillage of liquid microbiocidal composition and resulting skin irritance are obviated by taking advantage of the non dusting, flowable, easily detectable characteristics of the solid compositions of this invention. The preparation and properties of representative isothiazolones are described in U.S. Patents 3,517,022 3,761,488 and 3,065,123. U.S. Patent 3,849,430 further discloses a process for the preparation of representative isothiazolones. U.S. Patents 3,870,795 and 4,067,878 describe metal salt stabilized solutions of 3 isothiazolones which are useful according to this invention. Additional isothiazolones which are useful according to the invention are those disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,310,590. The finely divided water insoluble solid material can for example be selected from silicaceous diatomaceous earth, high water absorption capacity calcium silicate material, and clays. Suitable silicaceous diatomaceous earth material is described in the Johns Manville Corporation TechnicalBulletin FF 160A, 10 80 concerning Celite Diatomite FilterAids and Natural, Calcined, and Flux Calcined Grades thereof. Suitable high water absorption capacity calcium silicate material is commercially available as Micro Celw from the Johns Manville Corporation. Especially preferred is a diatomaceous earth material commercially available as Celite 545 Johns ManvilleCorporation . Of course, conventional adjuvants and additives used in microbiocidal formulations and compositions may be incorporated into the solid microbiocidal compositions of this invention for example by first dissolving them in thet aqueous or inert organic solvent solution of the isothiazolone s and then blending the solution with the solid carrier material. One useful additive for use in the solid microbiocidal composition of the invention is a dye which would impart a readily visible colour to the solid composition. Thus, whenever any solid microbiocidal composition would accidently be spilled onto the skin during handling, the spilled composition could readily be observes and removed before the toxicant could leach out of the solid and cause skin burns.This is in contrast to the case involving accidental spillage of the aqueous microbiocidal solution of the isothiazolone when handling in association with an aqueous system in which case it would be difficult to distinguish between harmless aqueous system and toxic isothiazolone concentrate. Also, a chelating agent can be added in order to chelate metals, for example, iron, dissolved in the aqueous system. The following Examples illustrate some embodiments of the invention. In the Examples all parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise indicated and all temperatures are in degrees Centrigrade unless otherwise indicated. Percentages of the metal salts magnesium nitrate and magnesium chloride are based on the weight of the usual commercial form.Example 1 To 75 g. of Celite 545 in a glass bottle was added 75 g. of Kathon 8861. The mixture was then stirred by hand with a spatula until it appeared to be uniformly mixed and free flowing. No drying by heating was required or desired. The resulting solid product contained one half of the initial amount of active ingredient per unit weight of product, that is, the solid composition contained 7 weight of active ingredient. The resulting solid microbiocidal composition was stored in a sealed bottle for several days at room temperature. Thereafter, when the stopper was removed, there was observed no gas emission due to pressure build up. 1.6 g. of the resulting solid microbiocidal composition was added to 1000 ml. of water to give 1001.6 g. total weight of water and solid microbiocidal composition.Analysis of the supernatant water by ultraviolet spectroscopy indicated that all of the Kathon 886 was released into the water within 5 minutes. When added to a suitable aqueous system, in this case an oil well drilling mud as an example of a system in which freely dispersed finely divided solid matter is of no concern, this composition freely released all of the water soluble microbiocidal active ingredient, Kathon 886, within a few minutes. Of course, as the active ingredient becomes exhausted in the aqueous system, additional solid microbiocidal composition may be added.1Kathon 886 is 5 chloro 2 methyl 3 isothiazolone blended with 2 methyl 3 isothiazolone in a weight ratio of 3 1 with 15 wt. Mg NO3 2 and 9 wt. of MgC12 in aqueous solution containing 14 active ingredient, commercially available from the Rohm and Haas Company.Example 2 A solid microbiocidal composition containing 20 weight of active ingredient was prepared by dissolving 2.66 g. of crystalline 5 chloro 2 methyl 3 isothiazolone in 15 ml. of methanol. To this solution there was added 0.6 g. of Mg NO3 2.6 H2O. The resulting solution was added to 10 g. of Celite 545 in a 4 fl. oz. bottle and the mixture was stirred by hand using a spatula until it appeared to be uniformly mixed and free flowing. Methanol was removed by air drying overnight or by heating the mixture under reduced pressure , and a uniform, free flowing particulate solid was obtained. The solid was stored in a sealed bottle for several days at room temperature and thereafter, when the stopper was removed, there was observed no gas emission due to pressure build up resulting from gas evolution from the solid composition.Upon adding the solid composition to water, all of the isothiazolone was released within minutes. Example 3 This example illustrates the property of the solid microbiocidal composition whereby the solid composition tends not to evolve gasses to the extent that the known aqueous solutions of 3 isothiazolones evolve gasses even after heat treatment to eliminate volatile components. The solid compositions were prepared as follows Water was partially removed from Kathon 886 aqueous concentrate under reduced pressure 650 C 40 mm Hg , and solid carrier material Celite 545, available fromJohns Manville Corporation, Attaclay X 250, available from the Minerals and Chemicals Corporation of America,Attapulgus Clay Products, HiSil T 600, available fromPittsburgh Plate and Glass Company, or mixtures thereof was added to the residue to obtain a flowable solid composition.
