# Gas detection device.

## Abstract
To permit the detection of CO as distinct from Hâ‚‚ the gas detection device has an eletrolytic cell in which electrode sur faces of a workin electrode 2, a counter electrode 5 and a refer ence electrode 6 are kept in contact with electrolyte 7 and opposite ends of the vessel containing the electrolyte are sealed by the working electrode 2 on the one hand and the counter electrode 5 and the reference electrode 6 on the other hand. Means 12, 13 are provided for measuring the current between the working electrode and the counter electrode and for applying a predetermined voltage between the working electrode and the reference electrode. The sensitivity of the working electrode 2 to carbon monoxide and hydrogen gas is smaller than that of the reference electrode 6.
