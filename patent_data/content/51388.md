# Multi stage pressure reducing system.

## Abstract
A multi stage pressure regulating system including a pilot governed main pressure reducing regulator 12 , with one or more passive back pressure regulators 14 arranged in tandem therewith. The regulators are valves of the type conditioned to open when the upstream pressure therein overcomes a jacket 30 pressure. The jacket 30 in the main valve 12 is loaded by upstream fluid, but a pilot 36 , which monitors a particular fluid flow characteristic, such as pressure, at a selected location in the pipeline, controls bleeding of the jacket as necessary to regulate flow through the main valve so as to maintain a predetermined value or level of the characteristic being monitored. Hence, flow through the main valve is controlled solely by the pilot device, but its discharge to the ultimate downstream level is through at least one auxiliary valve, the jacket 30a of which is loaded with a pneumatic pressure P
