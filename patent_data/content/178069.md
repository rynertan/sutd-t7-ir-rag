# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR DETECTING RADIATION IN A CONTAINER

## Abstract
Method and apparatus for detecting the emission of radia tion from a sample. The apparatus comprises a frame. Means are mounted on the frame for supporting the sample and for detecting radia tion. Means are also mounted on the frame for shielding the radiation detecting means from background radiation. The method comprises the steps of providing a radiation detector and a first shield for the radiation detector. The shield is opera tive to limit the sector in which radiation can be detected. A second shield is provided for minimizing background radiation that impinges on the detector so that the first and second shields define a testing zone and at least a portion of the sample to be tested is placed in the testing zone.
