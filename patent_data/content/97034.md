# Pressure fuser.

## Abstract
A cold pressure fuser comprising three rolls 78, 80 82 two of which 80, 82 have their axes parallel to each other and form a nip 100 through which copy sheets having toner images pass. The third roll 78 serves to apply the required load to the other two rolls to create the required pressure in the nip 100 therebetween. The axis of the third roll 78 is over skewed relative to the other rolls such that the distribution of the load between it and the roll which it contacts is peaked at its center and zero at its ends. A pair of load releasing arms 120 are provided to remove the loading from the rolls to there by facilitate paper jam clearance.
