## Description
A projector for projecting electromagnetic control signals The present invention relates to the field of information transmission employing an electromagnetic beam projector which supplies coordinate reference information to a remote receiver. Nore specifically, the present invention relates to a projector of a type comprising means for selectively generating a beam of radiation having a generally rectangular crosssectional area means located to receive said beam of radiation for scanning said beam over at least one predetermined path orthogonal to the length of said beam crosssection and means located in the path of said scan beam for projecting said beam as two altcrnately scanned beams having said cross sectional length dimensions orthogonally oriented with respect to each other. In U.S. Patent No. 3,398,918 two embodiments of optical systems are proposed for guiding projectiles. In the first embodiment, four fan shaped beams are independently modulated and projected towards a target and thereby form four optical walls of a pyramidal corridor for guiding projectiles. The size of the downrange corridor is controlled by a servo driven zoom lens arrangement. A projectile launched into this system tends to guide itself by bouncing around inside the corridor. In a second embodiment disclosed in the Girault reference, a proportional guidance system provides two perpendicularly oriented beams which sweep in directions perpendicular to each other in order to direct the projectile.In the second embodiment, the two beams are derived from a single light source and optically divided, respectively modulated and projected by a controlled zoom lens type system wherein the optical elements are physically reoriented with respect to each other. An improved electromagnetic radiation beam projector which eliminates the zoom lens system of the prior art and achieves more accurate control of the beam size projected in accordance with a time function has been proposed in our European PatentApplication No. 78300729.7. This projector is used, for instance, in a beam rider missile system, wherein the missile or projectile contains tail sensors which utilize the projected beam of radiation as a means of controlling its directional flight. By determining its relative location within the cross section of a projected beam pattern, the missile responds by steering itself to seek the centre of the beam pattern.In order to control the flight path of a missile having a known flight profile distance from launch versus time , it projects a matrix pattern so that the crosssectional area of information is maintained constant over the known flight profile. The projected scan pattern is formed by two alternately scanned and orthogonally oriented beams of radiation which are pulse modulated over respective predetermined ranges of pulse rates to present a plurality of mensurable pulse rates at predetermined relative coordinates, termed bins , within the defined matrix. A first beam, having a predetermined rectangular cross sectional area, is projected to that its length dimension is horizontal to a reference and is vertically scanned over a predetermined number of rate values within a first predetermined range of rates during its vertical scan over the predetermined angle. A second beam, having the same predetermined rectangular cross sectional area as the first beam is, in alternation with the first beam, oriented vertically with respect to the aforementioned reference and is scanned horizontally over the same predetermined angle to cover an area common to the vertically scanned area of the first beam. The second beam is also pulse modulated at a predetermined number of different rate values within a second predetermined range of rates during its horizontal scan over the predetermined angle. As a result, a matrix information pattern is projected which has a number of detectable bins corresponding to a particular vertical scan pulse rate and a horizontal scan pulse rate. For example, where the scanned beams are each pulse modulated at 51 different frequencies, 2,601 bins are defined in the matrix. In addition, since the scan beams are each pulse modulated over separate ranges e.g., 10.460 11.682 Ã¬z for the vertical scan and 13.089 15.060KHz for the horizontal scan , a discriminative receiver within the matrix can readily determine its position in that pattern. While the apparatus proposed four earlierEuropean Patent Application No. 78300729.7 provides good control of the missile it would be preferable to reduce the number of parts used in the apparatus and particularly the number of mechanically movable parts. The present invention therefore provides a projector for projecting electromagnetic control signals comprising a beam rotator which includes first and second relatively movable prism elements1 movement of one of said elements with respect to the other of said elements effecting a rotation of the beam means for effecting relative movement of said prism elements between a first state where said prism elements are evenly separated over opposing major optical transmitting faces and a second state where said prism elements are in optical contact along said opposite major faces and circuitry for driving said movement effecting means at a frequency corresponding to the scan frequency. The beam projector achieves beam rotation and derotation by utilizing principals of frustrated total internal reflection with a plurality of prism elements. Preferably, the beam rotator comprises a vibrationally modulated Pechan type prism to alternate the orthogonal orientation and scan directions of the beams prior to projection. The frequency of modulation is the same frequency as applied to the dither mirror and causes the two prism elements defining the Pechan type prism to synchronously make and break contact along opposing facing surfaces once each cycle. In the disclosed embodiment which is a modification of the embodiment shown in Fig. l of our above mentioned application, a single source of radiation is employed consisting of three selectively driven lasers which are individually coupled to corresponding fibre optic systems cross sectionally formatted to deliver radiation in any of three separately selectable cross sectional densities. In this single source of radiation, the lasers are individually and selectively driven so that only one is on at a time. Therefore, the output of the single source of radiation has a selectable crosssectional density and is a key factor in eliminating the need for variable optical systems zoom lenses of the prior art. Radiation, emitted from the single source, is fed to a scanning means such as a dither mirror which provides lateral scanning movement of the generally rectangular cross sectional radiation over predetermined angles at a fixed scan frequency. The scanned radiation is then fed to an improved beam rotator optical projection system, wherein, in synchronization with the scanning dither mirror, the beam i3 projected as beams which are alternately scanned in orthogonal directions and orthogonally oriented with respect to each other to provide respective pitch and yaw information. In order that the present invention be more readily understood an embodiment thereof will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 illustrates an embodiment of the present invention utilizing a single source of radiation and a modulated frustrated total internal reflection type beam rotator in a fixed focal length lens system for effecting alternate transmission of two orthogonally oriented beams Figure 2 illustrates the proportionately diffeiing cross sections of the radiation which are selectively transmitted by the radiation generating means shown in Figure 1 Figure 3 illustrates various control operations occurring over a period of time Figure 4A is a schematic illustration of the various parameters considered in the projection of the controlled radiation pattern over a typical flight path of a missile Figure 4B is a schematic illustration of the scanning pattern of the alternately projected beams of radiation at the low end of the range of the correspondingly selected light source Figure 4C is a schematic representation of the light beam pattern at the extreme end of the radiation scan pattern for the selected radiation source and Figure 5 is a block diagram illustrating an electrical control system for use in the embodiment of the present invention. In Figures 4A, 4B and 4C, a projected guidance pattern is illustrated over a hypothetical control range of approximately 3000 metres. The embodiment of the present invention is described herein with respect to this exemplified range of control. However, it should be understood that in each instance where specific measurements are given, in order to illustrate particular design parameters, such measurements are not restrictive of the scope of the present invention. The embodiment of the present invention is shown in Figure 1, wherein pitch P and yaw Y information beams of radiation are alternately projected from a beam projector utilizing a single source of radiation 2. The source 2 comprises threeGa As lasers, the outputs of which are fed to a beam shaper. In the present case, the lasers are optically interfaced to clad glass optical fibres inan assembly 3 shown in Figure 2 . It is desired to produce beams which have a cross section greater in one dimension than in the other. This is most conveniently done by using rectangular optical fibres or a bundle of optical fibres in a rectangular array.The clad glass fibre assembly 3 has three separate rectangular channels for conducting radiation from a correspondingly associated laser generator. Each rectangular channel A, B and C has a proportionately different cross sectional area but each has the same shape and aspect ratio for transmitting a beam 4 of oblong cross section and of a size in accordance with the particular individual laser which is selectively driven. In this embodiment, only one laser is driven at a time, in order to transmit a single beam having a desired cross sectional size. A dither mirror 6, mounted on a shaft 9, interrupts the beam 4 transmitted from the source 2 and reflectively scans the beam over a predetermined angle a in a direction orthogonal to the length dimension of the rectangular cross section of the beam 4. The shaft 9 is rotated for sinusoidal oscillatory motion through the predetermined angle a about an axis, which interrupts the path of beam 4, by a controlled galvanometer 7. The galvanometer 7 is controlled using the apparatus shown in Figure 5 which will be described in more detail later. A prismatic beam rotator 10 interrupts the beam 4 after it is reflected from the dither mirror 6 and focussed by a lens. The beam rotator 10 is shown as a Pechan type prism having its reversion axis at 450 with respect to the length dimension of the incoming beam 4. The rotator 10 comprises a receiving element 14 and a transmitting element 16. The receiving element 14 of the rotator 10 is rigidly mounted on a base 18, in common with all the other fixed elements of the system, to receive the incoming beam 4 at its unsilvered receiving face 22. Transmitting element 16 is mounted for reciprocating movement towards and away from a major unsilvered face 20 of the receiving element 14 by a vibrational transducer 12. The beam rotator 10 has two states which are dependent upon the relative locations of the two prism elements. In the first state1 the beam rotator 10 functions as a Pechan prism. The two prism elements 14 and 16 are evenly separated along their opposing unsilvered major faces 20 and 21 so that the vertically oriented beam entering the receiving face 22 of element 14 is internally reflected at major face 20, to a silvered face 24 and back to the major face 20 where it is normally incident. The beam exits major face 20 of the receiving element 14 and enters opposing major face 21 of transmitting element 16. The beam is then internally reflected from an exit face 28 to a silvered face 26, to major face 21 where it is internally reflected normal to the exit face 28 and transmitted as a horizontally oriented P beam rotated 0 by 90 with respect to the incoming beam. In the second state, the beam rotator 10 functions as a transmission window. The two prism elements 14 and 16 are in optical contact along their opposing major faces 20 and 21 to frustrate internal reflection at those faces. Therefore, the vertically oriented beam entering the receiving face Z21yasses directly through the element 14, the contacting major surfaces 20 and 21, and exits unsilvered face 28 of the transmitting element 16 as a vertically oriented beam. In the second state, the orient3tion of the beam is unaffected. This vertically oriented beam is projected by a fixed focal length lens system 30 as a Y information beam oriented 900 with respect to theP beam first state . Operation of the embodiment is explained by referring to Figure 3. A single laser in source 2 is synchronously tone modulated to transmit a beam 4 which is generally vertical with respect to a reference plane. At the beginning of the time cycle, the dither mirror 6 is at an extreme point of the predetermined scanned angle a and commences its rotational motion through that angle. It is assumed for the sake of this example that the mirror oscillates at 50 Hz and for the 50 Hz time cycles in Figure 3, the P beam is shown as being projected first. Therefore, during the first half cycle of the oscillatory rotation of the dither mirror 6, through the predetermined angle a, the major surfaces 20 and 21 of the rotator 10 are separated to effect rotation of the beam 4. Also during the period of the first half cycle that the dither mirror 6 is rotated, the selected laser of source 2 is pulse modulated over a first range of frequencies. Therefore, a P beam having a relatively horizontally oriented crosssection and continually changing pulse modulation frequency is projected and scanned in a relatively vertical direction. When the dither mirror 6 reaches the limit of its first half cycle of angular rotation, a dead period of image rotation is provided, of approximately 2.5 mS, wherein the selected laser is not modulated and the major surfaces 20 and 21 are moved into contact with each other to frustrate internal reflection and transmit the unrotated beam.The dither mirror 6 then synchronously begins rotation in its second half cycle of oscillatory rotation through the predetermined angle a. During that second half cycle, the selected laser is pulse modulated over a second range of frequencies and the beam is transmitted, without rotation, through the beam rotator 10. Therefore, the Y beam is projected having a relatively vertically oriented cross section and is scanned in a relatively horizontal direction. It is contemplated that the embodiments of the present invention have particular application in missile guidance systems, wherein the missile has a receiver with appropriate demodulation and logic electronics on board so as to enable the missile to respond to information received from the radiated beams. By identifying the two received pulse frequencies for the respectively received P and Y beams, the receiver will be able to determine the missile location within the projected pattern and command certain steering corrections to the missile. In Figures 4A, 4B and 4C, the projected information pattern is conceptually illustrated as an aid in describing the desired objectives obtained by the embodiments of the present invention. Figure 4A illustrates a hypothetical flight range of 3000 metres for a hypothetical missile which is to be guided by this system. Guidance is programmed to begin when the missile is 111 metres down range from the beam projector of the present invention. The system also requires, in this embodiment, that the missile move away from the beam projector along the line of sight path connecting the beam projector and the missile. Guidance of the missile continues as long as the missile receives guidance information. In this case, 3000 metres is the knownmaximum range of the missile, and therefor, the maximum range necessary for effective control of the projected information pattern. From knowledge of the velocity profile of the missile, during the time the missile is predicted to be in the range from 111 metres to 333 metres, the laser associated with the clad glass rectangular fibreA, shown in Figure 2, is selected for pulse modulation.In this example, the rectangular fibre A has crosssectional dimensions of 2.76 mm by 0.23 mm and an aspect ratio of 12 1. From this and one s knowledge of the other parts of the projector, it can be calculated that the resultant projected P beam crosssection measures 6 metres wide and 0.5 metres high at a range of 111 metres. When the P beam is at its lowest point of vertical scan at 111 metres it appears 3 metres below the optical axis of the projector. TheP beam scans upward see Figure 4B for 7.5 mS over a distance of 6 metres and then disappears. During this upward scan of the P beam, it is modulated over the first range at 51 different pulse rates in order to define 51 detectable levels within the projected pattern. Approximately 2.5 mS.after. the.,P beams disappears, the Y beam is projected having Xhe same dimensions as the P beam. As referenced by looking from the projector, the Y beam appears 3 metres to the left of the optical axis, at 111 metres downrange, and is scanned 6 metres in the right direction over the next 7.5 mS. During that scan period of 7.5 mS, the Y beam is pulse modulated at 51 different pulse rates in the second range, which is different from the first range of pulse rates for P beam modulation. Therefore, the combination of P and Y beams being swept across a common area in space defines 2601 separate bins of detectable information in a 51 x 51 matrix format, wherein the centre bin corresponds to the optical axis of the projector and desired path of the missile. It is most important to control the size of the scan pattern over the flight of the missile in order to communicate the same relative location information to the missile regardless of its dowo range position. For example, if the missile is 1 metre below and 3 metres to the left of the optic axis, when it is 111 metres down range, it receives pitch and yaw information corresponding to the particular bin located 1 metre below and 3 metres to the left of the optic axis bin. Therefore, since the objective is to provide a constant sized area of information with respect to the flight path profile, the missile will receive the same bin of pitch and yaw information indicated above at any down range location where the missile is 1 metre below and 3 metres to the left of the optic axis.Of course, the same holds true for all the other information bins located within the projected pattern of information. The apparatus maintains a constant sized area of information with respect to t he predicted flight path function of down range distance versus time, by varying the dither mirror scan angle a over a predetermined down range distance d t . Therefore1 during the time the missile is predicted to be moving down range, the dither mirror 6 is scanned over angle or Arctan h , where h represents the maintained square scan pattern height and width of 6 metres.By the time the missile reaches 333 metres1 one can calculate that the projected beams have diverged to have a length dimension of 18 metres and a width dimension of 1.5 metres, as is shown in Figure 4C, by controlling the dither mirror scan angle or, Since the beam width derived from the fibre A is so large at 333 metres, the laser associated with fibre A is turned off and the laser behind smaller fibre B is turned on. The cross sectional size of the fibre B is 0.914 mm X 0.076 mm, and also has an aspect ratio of 12 1. Therefore, the P and Y beam rectangular crosssections derived from fibre B at 333 metres are 6 metresX 0.5 metres, as shown in Figure 4D, and are scanned over the continually decreasing angle a until the missile distance is predicted to be at 1000 metres.At that point, the P and Y beam cross sections are the size indicated in Figure 4C with a 6 X 6 metre scan pattern size. At 1000 metres, the laser behind fibre B is turned off, the laser behind smaller fibre C is turned on and is appropriately modulated. The fibre C has dimensions of 0.305 mm X 0.025 mm and also has an aspect ratio of 12 1. At 1000 metres, the P and Y projected beams from the C fibre have dimensions of 6 metres X 0.5 metres, as shown in Figure 4B. The beam cross sections continue to diverge and at 3000 metres they reach dimensions, as shown in Figure 4C. This is the effective range but it could be extended using further lasers and beam shapers. The block diagram shown in Figure 5 is illustrative of how the apparatus is controlled to obtain the desired results. A master clock 142 generates a train of high frequency pulses to provide accurate timing for the various programmed functions. The output of the master clock 142 is fed to a timer counter 140, which is preset for the particular missile flight path profile. After a missile fire star signal is received, the timer counter 140 predicts when the missile is at 111 metres down range and outputs an enabling signal to AND gate 144. At that point, AND gate 144 is enabled to gate pulses from the master clock 142. Gated signals from the AND gate 144 are fed to a programmed divider 146 and to a tone generator 148.The programmed divider 146 is configured to output command signals at predetermined times along the known flight path in order to effect synchronization of proper laser selection, laser modulation, dither mirror scan, and beam rotation.An output of the programmed divider 146 is fed to aPROM 150 which functions as a sine wave look up table and provides a digital output in response to the count input address. The output of the PROM 150 is fed to a D to A converter 154 where the digital values are converted to a variably controlled amplitude 50 Hz analog sine wave. The analog sine wave is amplified by driver 156 and controls the angular movement of the dither mirror through dither galvanometer 7. The output of the programmed divider fed to the PROM 150 is also fed to a PROM 160, which functions as a sine wave look up table and provides a digital response to the count input address. The output of the PROM 160 is fed to a D to A converter 161 where the digital values are converted to a constant amplitude 50 liz analog sine wave. The output of theD to A converter 161 is fed to a driver 162 for amplification and the amplified output is fed to the piezoelectric transducer 12 for vibrationally modulating element 16 of the beam rotator 10. The programmed divider 146 also supplies a pitch yaw beam signal to a tone generator 148 which provides 51 steps of pulse rates to a selected laser driver over separate ranges for each respective pitch or yaw b eam transmission. An electronic switch 152 is controlled by the output of the programmed divider 146 to select the desired laser driver size format which receives the tone generator output. It is apparent that many modifications and variations may be effected without departing from the scope of the novel concepts of this invention.
