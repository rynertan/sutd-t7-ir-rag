## Description
PRODUCTION OF L AMINO ACIDS BY TRANSAMINATION This invention relates to the production of alpha amino acids and derivatives thereof, and in particular, to the production of L amino acids and their derivatives by transamination between L aspartic acid and alpha keto acid compounds corresponding to the desired amino acids. The invention also relates to the conversion of D. L amino acids toL amino acids in a single step process using Amino acid oxidase to convert the D amino acid to a 2 keto carboxylic acid and then using the transaminase to convert the 2 keto carboxylic acid toL amino acid.Background of the Invention Amino acids currently have application as additives to animal feed, nutritional supplements for human food, components in infusion solutions, and synthetic intermediates for the manufacture of pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals.L glutamic acid is used as a flavor enhancer for food with a world market of over 1 billion dollars annually. L lysine and methionine are large volume additives to animal feed, andL tryptophan and L threonine have similar potential applications.L phenylalanine and L aspartic acid have very important markets as key components in the manufacture of the sweetener aspartate.Infusion solutions require a range of amino acids including thosei essential in human diets. Methods currently in use for the production of amino acids include extraction, chemical synthesis followed by resolution, fermentation and enzymatic synthesis biocatalysis .The L form of the amino acid is required for most applications but certain amino acids are much more easily produced in the racemic D.L form rather than the L form. Extracticn procedures require extensive purification of the amino acid of interest from protein hydrolyzates. With chemical synthetic methods, normally a racemic mixture is formed, and the resolution to produce the optically active product is often costly and inefficient.Fermentation, while overcoming many of the disadvantages inherent in the previously mentioned methods, suffers from problems of slow rates of conversion, dilute solutions, costly purifications, and very high capital costs. Biocatalysis offers the potential for lower cost production in many cases primarily because of the significantly reduced capital requirements, lower purification costs due to the absence byproducts in the product stream, and higher rates of conversion of substrates to products because fewer enzymatic steps are involved. Some biocatalytic processes are currently in use. For example, L aspartic acid is produced in commercial quantities by the reaction of fumaric acid with ammonia in the presence of the enzyme aspartase. See Tosa et al, Appl. Microbiol. 21, 886 9 1974 . L phenylalanine can be produced by enzymatic synthesis from cinnamic acid and ammonia using the enzyme phenylalanine ammonia lyase. L alanine can be synthesized from L aspartic acid by enzymatic decarboxylation. See U.S. Patent Nos. 3,458,400 and 3,463,704. These processes are useful for the production of the individual amino acids listed. However, none of these processes is based on a general enzymatic technology broadly applicable to the production of many amino acids. One enzymatic process broadly applicable to the production of many amino acids is described in U.S. Patent No.3,183,170. In the process of U.S. 3,183,170 L glutamic acid and a keto acid are combined with transaminase to produce alpha keto glutaric acid and L amino acid. The alpha keto glutaric acid is II continuously reduced to L glutamic acid in the presence of a multi enzyme system, hydrogen gas, and a nitrogen source, such as inorganic ammonium salt, organic ammonium salt, ammonium hydroxide, ammonia gas, or urea. The L glutamic acid thus produced is recycled thus enabling the production of large amounts of L amino acid with a small quantity of L glutamic acid. However, this multienzyme system is difficult to operate on a commercial scale because it requires the cofactor NAD NADE which is expensive, hydrolytically unstable and sensitive to oxygen and to light. A commercial process for the resolution of D.L amino acids currentlv exists see T. Tosa. Biotech. Bioeng. 9, 603. 1967 . 1. Chibata et al.. Methods. Enzymol.. 44. 746 1976 . In the process. the D.L amino acid is reacted with acetic anhvdride to produce the D.L N acvl aminp acid. Reaction with the enzvme L amino acid acvlase from porcine kidnev or the fungus Aspergillus orvzae specificaliv hvdrolvzes onlv the L N acyl amino acid. producing a 1 1 mixture of the desired L amino acid and unreacted fiN acyl amino acid. These products are separated and the unreacted D N racvl amino acid is racemized and recycled through the process.Starting with the N acyl amino acid the process requires three discrete steps enzyme catalyzed hydrolysis of the L N acyl amino acid, physical separation of the L amino acid from the D Nacyl amino acid and racemization of the D N acyl amino acid for recycling through the Drocess. summary of the Invention The present invention provides an enzymatic process capable of producing many alpha amino acids from the readily available L aspartic acid or L aspartate . In the process of the present invention, L aspartic acid and an alpha keto acid are reacted in the presence of a transaminase to form L amino acid and oxaloacetate, followed by decarboxylation of said oxaloacetate to form pyruvic acid. The decarboxylation of oxaloacetate drives the reaction to completion. Yields of 95 or more of the desired L amino acid are readily obtained. The by product, pyruvic acid, is readily separated from the L amino acid and is highly marketable. The invention also provides a method for converting fl.L amino acids into L amino acids in a sinale step. In the process of the present invention. an enzvme Amino acid oxidase. is used to convert the amino acid in the D.L mixtures to the corresponding 2 keto acid. The 2 keto acid is in turn transaminated enzvmaticallv to the corresponding L amino acid in the same mixture. The two enzyme catalvzed reactions occur in a single process step. thus producina L amino acids directlv and in high vield from D.L amino acids. The conversion of D amino acids to 2 keto acids using D amino acid oxidase has been described by Nilsson et al, inAppl. Biochem, Biotechnol., 7, 47 9 1982 , See also Brodelius et al., Appl, Biochem, Biotechnol. 6, 293 308 1981 and Fink et al., MChE Symp. Ser. 74. 18 24 1978 . However there has been no suggestion for using D amino acid oxidase coupled with a transaminase to convert D,L amino acid mixtures directly to L amino acids. Detailed Description of the Invention In accord with this invention a class of enzymes known as transaminases aminotransferases catalyze the general reaction EMI5.1 2 Keto acid B L amino acid B By choosing the proper 2 keto acid precursor B, a desiredL amino acid B can be produced by transamination using anotherL amino acid A as the amino donor. As a byproduct of the reaction, a second 2 keto acid A is produced along with the desired L amino acid B. The advantages of this transamination technology are 1. L amino acids are produced specifically. 2. The 2 keto acid precursors are conveniently available from chemical synthesis. 3. The rates of reaction are relatively rapid. 4. The capital costs are lower than for a fermentation process. 5. The technology is general because transaminases with varying selectivities are available, e.g. aromatic amino acid transaminases, branched chain amino acid transaminases, transaminases specific for amino acids having acidic side chains, etc. Such transaminases can be prepared, for example, from the following microorganisms Escherichia coli E. coli , Bacillus subtilis, Achromobacter eurydice, Klebsiella aerogenes, and the like. Transaminases useful in the practice of this invention are also described by H.E. Umbarger in Annual Rev. Biochem., Vol. 47,j pp. 533 606 1978 . The single greatest disadvantage of this general method is that the equilibrium constant for the transamination reaction as written above is about 1.0. As a result, the yield of the desired amino acid for the reaction as written will never exceed approximately 50 . The key to the development of a commercially successful transamination process for the production of amino acids is overcoming the problem of incomplete conversion of 2 keto acid B to the desired L amino acid B. This problem is solved by the present invention by usingL aspartic acid as the amino donor L amino acid A and by converting the byproduct 2 keto acid A , i.e. oxaloacetate, by an irreversible reaction, decarboxylation, to pyruvic acid. Preferably, the irreversible decarboxylation of oxaloacetate is coupled to the transamination reaction. Thus, the transamination reaction is driven to completion, as shown below EMI7.1 By coupling the decarboxylation of the oxaloacetate to the transamination reaction in accord with this invention, the production of L amino acids in high yield can be obtained by this I biocatalytic method. Using this method, the conversion of the 2 ketoacid precursor B to the desired L amino acid B in yields approaching 100 have been achieved. The decarboxylation of oxaloacetate can be catalyzed either thermally chemically by various metal ions, amines and or acids or preferably enzymatically by the enzyme oxaloacetate decarboxylase OAD E.C. 4.1.1.3. Oxaloacetate decarboxylase from any source can be used. Examples of sources of oxaloacetate decarboxylase useful in the practice of the present invention are, for instance, Micrococcus luteus, renamed from Micrococcus lysodeikticus see Methods in Enzymologv 1, 753 7 1955 which is incorporated by reference, Pseudomonas putida see Biochem. Biophvs Acta 89, 381 3 1964 which is hereby incorporated by reference , and Azotobacter vinelandii see J. Biol. Chem. 180, 13 1949 which is hereby incorporated by reference , etc. Also, any other enzyme having an oxaloacetate decarboxylase activity but not usually regarded as an oxaloacetate decarboxylase may be used such as, for instance, pyruvate kinase, malic enzyme, etc. The activity of oxaloacetate decarboxylase can be enhanced by adding metal ions such as, for example, Mn , Cd , Co , Mg , Ni , Zn , Fe , Ca and the like. The process of this invention can thus be used for the production of a large variety of L amino acids by choosing the proper 2 keto acid precursor and an enzyme capable of transaminating it with L aspartic acid. For example, the amino acid L phenylalanine, a key component in the manufacture of the sweetener aspartame, has been prepared by this method in high yield from phenylpyruvate and L aspartic acid using a transaminase isolated from E. coli and an oxaloacetate decarboxylase isolated from either Pseudomanas putida orMicrococcus luteus.Similarly, using these same enzymes, phydroxyphenylpyruvate was converted into L tyrosine, indole 3 pyruvate or 3 3 indolyl pyruvic acid has been converted into L tryptophan, and 2 oxo 4 methylpentanoic acid has been converted into L leucine,and 4 phenyl 2 oxobutanoic acid has been converted into L 4 phenvl 2 arninobutanoic acid. By using transaminases with different specificities, 2 oo 3 methylpentanoic acid was transaminated to L isoleucine, 2 oxo 3 methylbutanoic acid to L valine, pyruvic acid toL alanine, 3 hydroxypyruvate to L serine, glyoxylic acid to glycine, and 2 oxo 4 thiomethylbutanoic acid to L methionine. Thus, R in the keto acid starting material RCOCO2H can be selected from a wide variety of substituents including, for example, hydrogen, substituted and unsubustituted lower alkyl, substituted and unsubstituted lower aryl, and heterocyclic groups. The term lower alkyl as used herein means both straight and branch chain alkyl groups having from one to about six carbon atoms. Substituted lower alkyl groups means lower alkyl groups substituted with hydroxy, mercapto, carbamoyl, carboxy, amino, amidino and R thio where R is lower alkyl groups such as fourd in natural amino acids. The term lower aryl as used herein means phenyl and benzyl groups. Substituted lower aryl groups includes phenyl and benzyl groups substituted with groups such as those listed above for lower aklyl. Heterocyclic groups as used herein means 4 imidazoylmethyl 3 indoylmethyl. and the like. Examples of such R groups suitable for the practice of the present invention include hydrogen, methyl, isopropyl, isobutyl, sec butyl, benzyl, phenyl l methylthio ethyl, hydroxymethyl, mercaptomethyl, p hydroxybenzyl, p hydroxyphenyl, carbamoylmethyl, carbamoylethyl, aminobutyl, amidinoaminopropyl, indolyl, 3 indoylmethyl, imidazoyl, 4 imidazoylmethyl, and the like. The byproduct of the decarboxylation of oxaloacetate, pyruvic acid, is a valuable commerical product and can be recovered from the product stream by any method described in the prior art, such as acidification and distillation, ion exchange, solvent extraction, and the like. In accord with another embodiment of this invention a class of enzymes known as amino acid oxidases 1E.C. 1.4.33.0 catalvze the general reaction shown in Scheme 1.EMI10.1 This enzyme reaction can be coupled to the above transaminase reaction to produce L amino acids from racemic mixtures ofD,L amino acids in accord with the following reaction scheme EMI11.1 Molecular oxygen is illustrated in the above reaction scheme as a hydrogen acceptor for D amino acid oxidase. producing hydrogen peroxide as a byproduct. However. other hydrogen acceptors such as dves can also be used D amino acid oxidase can be obtained from any source for use in this invention. Examples include porcine kidneyTrigonopsis variabillis. fungl of the aenus Candida. and the like. The D amino acid oxidase from porcine kidnev has been well characterized and an account of the properties of this enzyme can be found in A. Meister and D. Willner. The Enzymes, 1. 634 1963 . Other enzymes useful in the practice of the present invention are those having more substrate specificity such as D aspartate oxidase E.C. 1.4.3.1 and D glutamate oxidase E.C.1.4.3.7 . Such enzymes will be referred to collectivelv herein as D amino acid oxidase unless a more specific enzvme is used.The enzyme from porcine kidnev is preferred for use in this invention because it has a broad substrate specificity, acting on all D amino acids except those with acidic and basic side chains. It has a specific activity ranaina from 20 60 micromoles product produced per minute per milligram of protein. depending on which amino acid is chosen as substrate. Oxygen is the most .effective election acceDtor, but certain dves can also be used with lower efficiency, The enzyme is not inhibited by L amino acids or amino acid amines, but is competitively inhibited to varying degrees by 2 keto acids and 2 hydroxyacids, Appropriate amino group donors for the transamination reaction coupled to the D amino acid oxidase reaction are L glutamic acid and L astartic acld. Both of these amino acids are readily available and inexpensive, Preferably, L aspartic acid is used as the amino donor L amlno acid and the byproduct 2 keto acid A , i.e. oxaloacetate is converted by an irreversible reaction. decarboxylation. to pyruvic acid. Hvdroaen peroxide accumulation has been shown to inactivate enzvmes Greenfield et al., Annl. Biochem. 65. 109 1975 and can also cause the decomposition of 2 ketoacids. To prolong the half life of active enzyme in the coupled catalytic svstem and prevent ketoacid decomposition, the H2O2 produced in the step catalyzed by D amino acid oxidase can be renoved by any of several methods for decoupling H2O2 well known bv those skilled in the art. One method involves the use of the enzyme catalase. which catalyzes the disproportionation of H2IO2 to molecular oxygen and water as shown in the reaction EMI13.1 Catalase is commercially available from mammalian liver or Aspergillus niger. with the Aspergillus niger catalase showing better stability. The use of catalases has the added advantage that the disproportionation produces one molecule of O2 for every two molecules of H22 generated. Since O2 is the initial electron acceptor for D amino acid oxidase. its production bv disproportiontion of H2O2 by catalase helps supply the oxygen requirement for the oxidation of D amino acids and partially alleviates the problem of transfer of oxygen from air across a gas liquid interface. catalase. however. is slowly lnactlvated as well.A second method for removal of H2O2 involves its decomposltlon bv anv of several metallic oxides. The use of metal oxides. preferably manganese oxides such as Mn2O3, either with or without catalase. offers substantial stabilitv for fl amino acid oxidase. transaminase. and other enzymes used in the practice of this invention. Thus. the R aroup in the D,L amino acid starting material can be selected from a wide varietv of substituents including. for example. hydrogen. substituted and unsubstituted lower alkyl. substituted and unsubstituted lower aryl. and heterocvclic groups which are defined above. The enzymes can be added to the reaction mixture in whole cells, crude cell lysates, as partially purified enzyme or purified enzyme. Preferably purified enzymes are used, either immobilized or in solution, because the conversion rates per unit of enzyme are higher. The enzymes can be purified by techniques I well known to those skilled in the art. Examples of purification of oxaloacetate decarboxylase from Micrococcus luteus andPseudomonas putida are described by Herbert, Methods in Enzymoloay 1, pp. 753 57 1955 and by Morton et al., Biochem.Biophys. Acta. X, pp. 381 83 1964 . The enzymes can be used in solution or as immobilized enzymes, as aforesaid, in the practice of this invention. One example of an immobilized enzyme system is described by Weetall et al., Methods inEnzvmologvli, pp. 59 72 1974 , which is hereby incorporated by reference. Weetall et al. describe a method for immobilizing enzymes on glutaraldehyde activated controlled pore glass beads Corning . In accord with this method, transaminase was coupled to the glass particles by reacting the enzyme with the activated glass particles at 0 50C for 2 hours in a phosphate buffer solution having a pH of 7.0. The coupled enzyme can be used directly or first reacted with 18 sodium borohydride to stabilize the covalent link between the enzyme and the activated glass. Other suitable substrates for immobilizing enzymes for the practice of this invention include porous ceramic, sepharose, diethylaminoethyl cellulose, and the like. These substances can be activated, if desired, by techniques well known in the art. The oxaloacetate decarboxylase is either immobilized separately, or first mixed with the transaminase and the mixture co immobilized. Glass beads on which the enzymes had been covalently attached by the aforedescribed procedures were suspended in a solution containing 10 mM phenylpyruvate, 10 mM L aspartic acid, 1 mM MgC12 or MnS04, pH adjusted to the range 4.0 10.0 and most preferably between 5.5 and 8.5. When all the phenylpyruvate had been consumed, the solution was filtered away from the glass beads and the products L phenylalanine and pyruvic acid isolated and purified by conventional methods. The D amino acid oxidase and transaminase mav also be immobilized separately or first mixed together and co immobilized as a mixture. In like manner. catalase and or oxaloacetate decarboxvlase mav also be either immobilized separately or mixed with the other enzymes and the mixture co immobilized. Immobilization supports to which the enzymes have been attached can be suspended in a solution containing D.L amino acid. an amino donor preferably L aspartic acid. and pyridoxal phosphate as a cofactor for the transaminase with the DH adjusted to the range 2.0 to 12.0 and most preferably between 5.5 and 8.5. and the solution incubated at a temperature between 40c and 500C and most Dreferablv between 150C and 400c. The reaction can be monitored either bv polarimetry or by measuring the consumption of L aspartic acid.When the optical rotation of the solution has ceased changina or no further consumption of L aspartic acid is noted. the solution is filtered awav from the immobilized enzvme and the L amino acid is isolated and l urlfled by any methods in the prior art such as preciDitation. crystallization. ion exchange chromatoaraphy and the like. The reaction of L aspartic acid to produce L amino acids and pyruvic acid can be monitored if desired. A general assay which is applicable to the assay of all transamination reactions using L aspartic acid as the amino donor regardless of the 2 keto acid precursor that is used is the following L aspartic acid, a 2 keto acid, transaminase, NADH, and the enzyme malic dehyrogenase available commercially are dissolved in solution of phosphate buffer as a pH between 6.0 and 9.0 the change in the absorbance at 340 nm A340 with time is measured. This change in the absorbance at 340 nm corresponds to the consumption of NADH during the reduction of oxaloacetate, formed fromL asparate during the transamination reaction. As an alternative, for instance, the conversion of phenylpyruvate to L phenylalanine can be conveniently assayed by taking aliquots from the reaction mixture containing, for instance, transaminase, phenylpyruvate, L aspartate, oxaloacetate decarboxylase, and metal ions, diluting them into a solution of 2.5 sodium hydroxide in water w v , and measuring the absorbance at 320 nm. Dilution into sodium hydroxide causes rapid achievement of the equilibrium between the keto and enol forms of phenylpyruvate. The extinction coefficient at 320 nm for the equilibrium mixture is 17500 M 1 cm l. Thus, the conversion of phenylpyruvate into L phenylalanine can be quantitated rapidly.This asssay can be corroborated by measuring L phenylalanine qualitatively by paper chromatography and quantitatively using an amino acid analyzer. Similar techniques can be used to assay for the conversion of other 2 keto acids into the corresponding L amino acids. The transamination of p hydroxyphenylpyruvate toL tyrosine can be monitored by diluting aliquots removed from the reaction mixture into 2.5 NaOH and measuring the absorbance at 331 nm extinction coefficient of 19900 m l cm l, and the conversion of indole 3 pyruvate into L tryptophan can likewise be followed by measuring the absorbance at 328 nm extinction coefficient of 10000 M 1 cm 1 . The invention will now be further illustrated by the following examples which are given here for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.Example I Preparation of Aromatic Acid Transaminase E. coli K 12 maintained on L broth plates was innoculated into 2.0 liter shake flasks containing 500 ml of the medium listed below KH2PO4 5 g Liter K2HPO4 5.56 g liter NH4 2S04 2 g liter MgS04 75 mg liter Na3 Ccitrate 2H2O 1 g liter Trace Metals 3 ml liter Glucose 10 g liter Preparation of Trace Metals Solution Metal Salts Amount Final concentrationsFeCl3.6H2O 27 g l 300 uMZnCl2 1.3 g l 30 uMCoCl2.6H2O 2 g l 25 1 Na2MoO4.2H2O 2 g l 25 uMCaCl2.2H2O 1 g l 20 uMCuCl2.2H2O 1.27 g l 22 uM H3BO3 0.5 g l 24 uMHC1 conc 100 ml l 3.6 uM Growth was at 37 C for 15 hours.These flasks were used to innqculate 14 liter Biolafitte fermenters 1 liter of shake flask culture into 7 liters containing 7 liters of the growth medium listed below K2HPO4 3.6 g liter NH4 2SO4 750 mg liter Na3 citrate .2H2O 1 g liter Trace metals 3 ml liter Pump in glucose as needed.

Both immediately, and after incubation at 22 C for 12 hours, the reaction mixture was assayed for phenylpyruvate. The level of conversion was calculated to be 98.5 based on the amount of phenylpyruvate converted. Amino acid analysis of the reaction mixture showed only two peaks corresponding to L phenylalanine and unreacted L aspartic acid. No other amino acid products were detected. Example 3. Immobilization of transaminase and oxaloacetate decarboxylase An aqueous solution of 2.0ml of 50mM potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, containing 1.5 units of transaminase and 5.4 units of oxaloacetate decarboxylase isolated from Micrococcus luteus was added to 5ml of DEAE celulose gel Whatman DE 52 previously equilibrated to pH 8.0 in 50mM phosphate buffer.
