## Abstract
A joint transform correlator in which a servo feedback system 18 is included which employs the correlation signal output to electronically modify the representation of the archetype in the reference scene portrayed in one of the spatial light modulators 12 of the correlator to make it a closer match to any quarry discovered in the investigation scene portrayed in the other spatial light modulator 11 .
