# Compact steel cord for improved tensile strength.

## Abstract
A steel cord for use in the reinforcement of resilient ar ticles such as rubber tyres has a core 1 3 and one sur rounding layer 4 12 of wires, the diameter and twist pitch of the core wires 1 3 being substantially different from the diameter and twist pitch of the wires of the layer 4 12 sur rounding the core. This construction eliminates wire migra tion without loss of reinforcing ability of the cord in the re silient material.
