# A cladding tube for a nuclear fuel element consisting of an alloy which contains nickel.

## Abstract
A nuclear fuel cladding tube for liquid metal fast breeder reactors such as those using liquid sodium as a heat transfer agent. The cladding tube has a coating which comprises a mixture of nickel aluminum intermetallic phases. This coating presents good corrosion resistance to liquid sodium at temperatures up to 700 C while additionally forming a barrier to outward diffusion of ⁵⁴Mn.
