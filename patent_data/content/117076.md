# Liquid gas contact means.

## Abstract
A plate for assembly with similar plates to form a cooling tower packing and comprising a series of parallel mutually spaced ridges which are generally triangular in transverse cross section. The ridges form means for spacing apart adjacent plates and when the plates are assembled together define opposite sides of at least one duct through which liquid is passed in contact with the duct surfaces while gas is passed through the duct to cool the liquid. The reverse sides of the ridges preferably form depressions which are V shaped in tranverse cross section, one of which is provided in each duct.
