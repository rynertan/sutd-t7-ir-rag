# A read only memory.

## Abstract
A read only rnemory ROM comprising word lines WLi, WLj, WLk , bit lines BLi, BLm virtual ground lines VGl, VGm and memory cells CLi, CLj, CLk of FETs arranged on intersections of the word lines and bit lines. A gate of each cell is connected to one of the word lines. A drain of each cell is connected to one of the bit lines. A source of each cell is connected to one of the virtual ground lines. According to the invention, particular cells storing information O are depletion type transistors, the threshold voltage of which being lowered by ion im plantation. When ROM is in operation with respect to the memory cells on a selected bit line, the potential difference between a selected word line and a selected virtual ground line is enough to turn on the depletion type cell but not enough to turn on the other cells and, the potential diffe rence between a nonselected word line and selected virtual ground line is not enough to turn on the depletion type cell.
