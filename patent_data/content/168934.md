# Welding gun.

## Abstract
A welding gun 10 has a handle 12 housing a connector assembly 14 for a composition cable 44 including a core tube 46 for guiding welding wire, a surrounding passage for shielding gas and electrical cable strands 16 between inner and outer insulating sheaths for conducting welding current to a welding tip of the gun via a connector body 30 of the connector assembly 14 . In order to avoid abrasion of the cable strands, they are clamped against a tapered surface of the connector body 30 by a sleeve 22 which is advanced axially without rotation by a compression nut 20 screwed onto the connector body 30 .
