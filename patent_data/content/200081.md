## Description
The present invention relates to a pumping up generator motor system for use with a pumping up power plant, or more in particular to a pumping up generator motor system using a wound rotor type induction machine. Prior to explanation of a conventional method of operating a generator motor system of this type such as a supersynchronous Scherbius system, explanation will be made about a system therefor. Such a system as disclosed in U. S. Patent 4,481,455 issued to Sugimoto et. al. on November 6, 1984 includes a generator motor 2 selectively driving a water turbine 1 as a load machine in a motor mode or driven by a prime mover in a generator mode as shown in Fig. 6. This generator motor has a structure of a wound rotor type induction machine with and its rotor is connected to cyclo converters 3 through slip rings 4. Each cyclo converter 3 is connected to a power line system through a transformer 5. In operation thereof, each cyclo converter is controlled, when the generator motor is driven in a motor mode, so as to control the rotational speed of the motor and, when driven in generator mode, so as to regulate the frequency of the generator output at a constant level regardless of the rotational speed of the generator. In this configuration and operation, however, when the cyclo converter is driven at a vicinity of its synchronous speed where the slip is small , the polarity of direction of the current flowing in the cyclo converter is changed at a relatively long time interval and hence the current of the cyclo converter flows mainly through one side of the inverse parallel connected rectifiers of the cyclo converter. In order to prevent the cyclo converter from being overheated, therefore, it is required to reduce the output of the generator motor when it is driven at a vicinity of the synchronous speed where slip is small, or if it is desired not to reduce the output of the generator motor, it is necessary to use a cyclo converter of a large capacity. In the pumping up power plant, on the other hand, it is common practice to set the rated water flow rate in operation of the generator mode almost to the same value as that in operation of the motor mode, that is, pumping up mode. In the case of a turbo machine typically such as a pump turbine, the rotational speed N Specifically, if the maximum efficiency of the water turbine is to be maintained in variation of its water head or output in the generator mode, it is necessary to maintain the speed variation in a vicinity of the rotational speed N Now, the relationship between the speed control range and the rotational speed N where N is the rotating speed and N When a cyclo converter is used and the generator motor is driven in a vicinity of the synchronous speed, however, the output frequency of the cyclo converter is very small near to a direct current, resulting in the necessity of either reducing the output of the generator motor or increasing the capacity of the cyclo converter as mentioned above. For this reason, in another conventional method, the speed range is set below the synchronous speed in the generator mode as shown in Fig. 4. In this method, however, as compared with the arrangement of Fig. 2 assuming that the maximum slip set value Smax and the capacity of the converter elements are made the same, the speed control range in the generator mode is narrowed thereby to reduce the average efficiency. A generator motor of this type using a cyclo converter is disclosed in IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems , Vol. PAS 100, No. 5, May 1981 Pages 2171 to 2176 and Vol. PAS 99 No. 5, Sept Oct 1980 Pages 1828 to 1837 . The present invention has been developed in view of the above mentioned facts, and it is an object thereof to provide a method of operation of a generator motor of this type which is effective to improve the efficiency in the generator mode and to provide a wide speed control range in the motor operation mode, without increasing the capacity of the cyclo converter. This problem is solved by the feature of the apparatus Claim 1 and the method Claim 2. Fig. 1 is a system diagram showing a method of operation according to the present invention. Fig. 2 is a diagram showing speed ranges in the generator mode and motor mode, respectively. Fig. 3 is a diagram showing the relationship between the speed ranges and the synchronous speed. Fig. 4 is a diagram showing an operation range for a conventional system. Fig. 5 is a diagram showing an operation range according to the present invention. Fig. 6 is a system diagram for explaining a method of operation according to the prior art. The present invention will be explained in detail with reference to an embodiment shown in the accompanying drawings. In Fig. 1, a generator motor 2 of a wound rotor induction motor structure is connected to a water turbine 1 which acts as a prime mover in the generator mode and a load in the motor mode. Each cycle converter 3 is supplied with a commercial frequency reduced or boosted through a transformer 5 from the power system, converts it into a slip frequency, and supplies the converted frequency to the rotor winding of the generator motor 2 through a slip ring 4. The cyclo converter 3 includes a plurality of bridge connection converter units 6 of the same specification. Further, the cyclo converter 3 includes switches 7, 8 and 9 which are closed or opened by control of a switch changer 10 depending on the operation mode of the converter 3. .In the motor operation mode, the switches 7 and 9 are opened and the switch 8 is closed. As a result, the voltage capacity of the converter is a multiple of the number of the converter units 6 connected in series. It is therefore possible to drive the motor with a slip larger than with a single bridge. In the generator mode, on the other hand, the switches 7 and 9 are closed, while the switch 8 is opened. In this case, reactors 11 are provided to reduce a circulating current through the parallel connected converter units 6. Further, however, the connection to the transformer 5 may be switched to a lower voltage tap provided in the low voltage winding not shown of the transformer 5. The value of the output voltage is set to about the rated voltage for motor operation divided by the number of the parallel connected converter units. In this way, the current capacity of the frequency converter 3 is multiplied by the number of parallel connected units, thereby enabling the generator to be driven at about the synchronous speed. Also, according to the present invention, the center of the speed range of the water turbine in the generator mode is set to about the synchronous speed. The maximum slip Smax G in the generator mode is set to be almost the same as the maximum slip Smax D in the motor or pumping up mode divided by the number Np of parallel connected converter units, i.e. Smax G 1 Np Smax P . Since the voltage rating of the cyclo converter is proportional to the maximum slip, the voltage rating of the cyclo converter can be lower in the generator mode than in the motor mode. As a consequence, by connecting a plurality of converter units in parallel, the current capacity is increased, thereby making it possible to drive the generator near the synchronous speed. In the motor mode, on the other hand, the converter units are connected in series and the center of the operating speed range is made higher than the synchronous speed. The present invention provides meritorious effects mentioned below. First, when the maximum slip in the pumping up mode is selected to be the same as that in Fig. 3 or 4, it is possible to set a large margin of output regulation about the synchronous speed, thus reducing the effect of the in operable speed range around the synchronous speed. This is due to the fact that the speed range in the motor mode can be increased as the speed at the rated output in the generator mode is increased. Secondly, unlike the case of Fig. 4, it is possible to operate the generator motor in the pumping up mode at a wide speed range avoiding the synchronous speed, as shown in Fig. 5, thereby improving the partial load efficiency of the water turbine while eliminating the problem of operating the generator motor in the generator mode near the synchronous speed. It will thus be understood from the foregoing description that according to the present invention there is provided a method of operation of an induction type generator motor in which the center of its operating speed range on the generator mode is set near the synchronous speed, and a connection of a plurality of converter units constituting each cyclo converter is selectively changed such that the converter units are connected in parallel in the generator mode and in series in the motor mode. In this way, the current capacity of the cyclo converter is increased in the generator mode, while the voltage capacity is increased in the motor mode, so that it is possible to achieve the maximum water turbine efficiency in the generator mode and the maximum output range in the pumping up mode without increasing the capacity of the converter units.
