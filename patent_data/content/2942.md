## Description
DESCRIPTION TITLE PROCESS FOUR so FOR PRODUCING 3 AMINO 2 CYCLOHEXENONE This invention relates to a process for producing 3 amino 2 cyclohexenone which is useful as an intermediate for the production of m aminophenol, cyclohexane 1,3 dione, resorcinol, etc. Specifically, it relates to a process for producing 3 amino 2cyclohexenone in superior conversion and selectivity by heat cyclization of 5 oxohexanenitrile. More specifically, the invention relates to a process for producing 3 amino 2 cyclohexenone of the formulaEMI1.1 which comprises heating 5 oxohexanenitrile of the formulaEMI1.2 at a temperature of about 160 0C to about 220 0C in the presence of a basic catalyst in an inert organic polar solvent. Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No.34859 73 published on May 22, 1973 corresponding toGerman OLS 2144169 and 2144170 discloses a process for preparing substituted cyclohexen 2 ones which comprises reacting a cyanoethylated ketone of the formulaEMI1.3 wherein R1 represents hydrogen or alkyl of 1 to 5, preferably 1 to 3, carbon atoms, and R2 and R3 are identical or different and represent hydrogen, alkyl of 1 to 5, preferably 1 to 3, carbon atoms, or B cyanoethyl, at a temperature of about 20 to about 1500C in the presence of a basic catalyst such as an alkali metal hydroxide in a polar solvent. This Japanese Publication does not give a specific disclosure about the production of 3amino 2 cyclohexenone from 5 oxohexanenitrile which corresponds to a compound of the above formula in which all of R1,R2 and R3 are hydrogen. All the working examples in thisPublication are directed to the production of 3 amino2 cyclohexenones from 4 substituted 5 oxohexanenitrile in which R2 or R3 is a substituent other than hydrogen, such as alkyl or B cyanoethyl, and the reaction temperature is limited to about 29 to 1500 C. The present inventors attempted at the production of the 3 amino 2 cyclohexenone, which is useful as an intermediate for various useful compounds including m aminophenol, cyclohexane 1,3 dione and resorcinol, by the cyclization of 5 oxohexanenitrile. This attempt led to the discovery that at a temperature of about 20 to about 1500C recommended by the prior patent literature, the cyclization of 5 oxohexanenitrile with an unsubstituted 4 position to 3 amino 2 cyclohexenone gives much worse results than the cyclization of the aforesaid 4 substituted compound.Accordingly, the inventors worked on the cyclization reactivity of the 5 oxohexanenitrile, and found that at the reaction temperatures recommended by the prior art, the reactivity of the 5oxohexanenitrile with the unsubstituted 4 position is low, and the selectivity of the starting compound for 6 methyl 3,4 dihydro 2 pyridone increases while its selectivity for the desired 3 amino 2 cyclohexenone and the yield of the 3 amino 2 cyclohexenone are considerably low. The inventors furthered their investigations in order to overcome the technical disadvantage associated with the above 5 oxohexanenitrile which is not specifically disclosed by the prior art. It has consequently been found that within a temperature range of about 1600C to about 2200C, preferably about 730C to about 2000C, which exceeds the upper limit 15000 of the reaction temperatures disclosed by the prior art, the conversion of 5 oxohexanenitrile and its selectivity for 3 amino2 cyclohexenone increase critically, and at temperatures below the lower limit of the above temperature range i.e., the temperatures suggested heretofore and above the upper limit of the above temperature range, the selectivity for the by product 6methyl 3,4 dihydro 2 pyridone abruptly increases and the selectivity for the desired 3 amino 2 cyclohexenone and its yield are reduced markedly. It is an object of this invention therefore to provide a process for producing 3 amino 2 cyclohexenone with commercial advantage by the heat cyclization of 5 oxohexanenitril e. The above and other objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description. According to the process of this invention, 3amino 2 cyclohexenone of the formula given hereinabove can be produced in high conversions and selectivities by heating 5 oxohexanenitrile of the formula given hereinabove at about 1600C to about 2200C, preferably about 17000 to about 200 0C, in the presence of a basic catalyst in an inert organic polar solvent to cyclize the 5 oxohexanenitril e. Specific examples of the solvent used in this process include alcohols containing 1 to 6 carbon atoms such as methanol, ethanol, n propanol, isopropanol, nbutanol, sec butanol, tert butanol, pentanol, tert amylalcohol and hexanol ethers containing 4 to 14 carbon atoms such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, diglyme and triethylene glycol dimethyl ether nitriles containing 1 to 3 carbon atoms such as acetonitrile and propionitrile amines containing 3 to 8 carbon atoms such as trimethylamine, triethylamine, pyridine and a picoline dialkylformamides with the alkyl group containing 1 or 2 carbon atoms such as dimethylformamide and dimethyl formamide phosphoric acid amides such as hexamethylphosphoric triamide and sulfoxides such as dimethyl sulfoxide. Of these, tertiary alcohols, especially tert butanol, are preferred.Mixtures of two or more of these organic polar solvents, and mixtures of them with organic nonpolar solvents can also be used. Examples of the organic non polar solvents are aliphatic hydrocarbons such as hexane, heptane, octane, nonane and decane and aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene and p xylene. The amount of the organic polar solvent can be used in an amount such that the weight ratio of it to the 5 oxohexanenitrile is from 1 1 to 1000 1, preferably from 5 1 to 200 1. Specific examples of the basic catalyst used in the above process are alkali metal hydroxides such as potassium hydroxide and sodium hydroxide alkali metal alkoxides such as potassium methoxide, potassium ethoxide, potassium propoxides and potassium butoxides and the corresponding sodium alkoxides alkali metal amides such as sodium amide and potassium amide alkali metal hydrides such as sodium hydride and alkali metals such as sodium and potassium. Of these basic catalysts, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, potassium alkoxides, and sodium alkoxides are preferred. Potassium hydroxide and potassium alkoxides are especially preferred. The amount of the basic catalyst can be varied widely. Usually, it is about 0.001 to about 1 mole, preferably about 0,O05 to about 0.2 moles, per mole of the starting 5 oxohexanenitrile. The heat cyclization reaction is carried out at a temperature of about 160 to about 2200C, preferably about 170 to about 200 C. If the heating temperature is lower than about 160 C, the conversion of the 5oxohexanenitrile decreases, and its selectivity for 6 methyl 3,4 dihydro 2 pyridone, a by product, increases abruptly, thus causing a reduction in the selectivity for amino 2 cyclohexenone and its yield. On the other hand, if the heating temperature exceeds about 22000, the selection for the by product 6 methyl 3,4 dihydro 2 pyridone increases, and 3 amino 2 cyclohexenone which has been formed may be consumed by a secondary reaction.Hence, the selection for 3 amino 2 cyclohexenone and its yield decrease. By maintaining the heating temperature at 170 to 2000C, the selectivity for 3 amino 2cyclohexenone and its yield can be increased further. The above process can be performed either batchwise, semicontinuously or continuously. When 5oxohexanenitrile is fully diluted with a solvent in the aforesaid process, the formation of the by product 6 methyl 3,4 dihydro 2 pyridone can be inhibited to some extent, and the selectivity for 3 amino 2 cyclohexenone can be increased. Accordingly, it is preferred to use the solvent in an amount which is as excessive as is commercially permissible. It is preferred that the reaction be carried out under conditions such that the concentration of the starting 5 oxohexanenitrile in the reaction system does not exceed about 0.5 mole liter, for example, under such conditions that the concentration of the 5 oxohexanenitrile is about 0.1 to about 0.5 mole liter of solvent.The reaction time is not critical, either, and may, for example, be about 0.5 to about 4 hours The selectivity for 3 amino 2 cyclohexenone can thus be increased if 5 oxohexanenitrile is added to the reaction system so that the concentration of the unreacted 5 oxohexanenitrile in the reaction solution does not exceed 3.5 mole liter. After the reaction, the reaction mixture is treated in a customary manner such as distillation or crystallization to separate 3 amino 2 cyclohexenone. Dehydrogenation of the resulting 3 amino 2cyclohexenone in accordance with British Patent 1,481,573 can yield m aminophenol. Furthermore, cyclohexane l,i dione can be obtained by reacting the 3 amino 2 cyclohexenone with water at a temperature of about 0 to about 200 C in the presence of a basic or acidic catalyst in accordance with another invention of the present inventor. Dehydrogenation of the cyclohexane 1,3 dione in accordance with, for example, British Patent 1,517,726 can afford resorcinol. The process of the invention is specifically illustrated by the following examples.Examples 1 to 9 An argon purged 50 ml. stainless steel autoclave was charged with 5 oxohexanenitrile, the catalyst and the solvent shown in Table 1 in the amounts indicated, and the reaction was performed under the conditions shown in Table 1.
