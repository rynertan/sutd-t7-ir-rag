## Description
POLYCARBONATE RESIN MIXTURES BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to thermoplastic compositions having improved impact strength.More particularly, it relates to polycarbonate resin mixtures having improved impact strength, especially in thick sections. Aromatic carbonate polymers are well known, commercially available materials having a wide variety of applications in the plastics art.Such carbonate polymers may be prepared by reacting a dihydric phenol, such as 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane, with a carbonate precursor, such as phosgene, in the presence of an acid binding agent. Generally speaking, aromatic polycarbonate resins offer a high resistance to the attack of mineral acids, may be easily molded, and are physiologically harmless as well as strain resistant. It is also well known that polycarbonate resins have high impact strength below a critical thickness of between about 1 8 and 1 4 inch. Above this average thickness polycarbonate resins become embrittled. Additionally, the impact strength of polycarbonate resins decreases rapidly as the temperature decreases below about 5 C. and also after aging the polymers at elevated temperatures above about 1000C.These characteristics conseguently limit the fields of application for unmodified aromatic polycarbonate resins. Accordingly, in an effort to improve the impact resistant behavior of polycarbonate resins, it has been proposed to add modifiers to the polycarbonate. In Goldblum, U.S. 3,431,224, assigned to the same assignee as the present invention, for example, it is proposed to add modifiers, in certain proportions, the modifiers comprising at least one member of the class consisting of polyethylene, polypropylene, polyisobutylene, a copolymer of ethylene and an ethyl acrylate, a copolymer of ethylene and propylene, a cellulose ester, a polyamide, a polyvinyl acetal, an alkyl cellulose ester, and a polyurethane elastomer. These compositions also have a tendency to embrittle in parts with sections above the critical thickness of aromatic polycarbonate. Another modifier proposed to be added to polycarbonate is reported in Research Disclosure No.20810, Dow Chemical Company, August 1981. Data are provided showing that polycarbonate modified with a linear low density polyolefin, namely ethylene octene l copolymer, provide good impact strength at increased part thickness. In U.S. 4,245,058 to Liu, assigned to the same assignee as the present invention, it is disclosed that compositions comprising a high molecular weight aromatic polycarbonate, an acrylate copolymer and a polyolefin exhibit improved aged impact strength, both low and high temperature impact strength and good weld line strength as compared with unmodified polycarbonate. Nakamura, et al., discloses in U.S. 3,864,428 compositions comprising blends of aromatic polyester, aromatic polycarbonate and butadiene based graft copolymers, wherein the polycarbonate comprises from 10 to 75 weight percent of the overall blend, which are said to possess good room temperature impact strength. Fromuth, et al., in U.S. 4,180,494, discloses high impact strength compositions comprising about 25 to 95 percent by weight aromatic polyester, about 1 to 8 percent by weight of an aromatic polycarbonate and the balance to make 100 of a core shell copolymer having a butadiene based core. Farnham, et al., in U.S. 4,086,202 discloses that the impact resistance of poly alkylene terephthalate resins is improved by the incorporation of a multiphase composite interpolymer having an elastomeric first stage and a thermoplastic final stage. Liu, U.S.P. 4,260,693 discloses that the temperature impact resistance of aromatic polycarbonate is improved by the incorporation of a multiphase composite interpolymer and an olefin acrylate copolymer. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It has now been discovered that an aromatic carbonate polymer resin comprising a mixture of an aromatic polycarbonate resin and a copolyestercarbonate resin may be provided with enhanced impact strength in thick walled molded sections and in thin walled molded sections at room temperatures, by incorporating therewith, in certain proportions, an impact modifier combination there for comprising a multiphase composite interpolymer having a rubbery acrylate core and hard thermoplastic shell and a copolymer of an olefin with an acrylate or methacrylate comonomer. It has now been found that when the abovementioned modifiers are added to a polycarbonate resin copolyestercarbonate resin blend, within certain ranges, the resultant mixtures possess surprisingly improved impact strength at room temperatures when compared to unmodified polycarbonate resins. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the present invention it has been found that the foregoing desirable properties are obtained with resin mixtures comprising an intimate admixture of a a major amount of an aromatic carbonate polymer resin mixture of i an aromatic polycarbonate and ii a poly ester carbonate copolymer resin and an effective impact modifying amount of an impact modifier combination of a comprising i a multiphase composite interpolymer comprising a first elastomeric core stage of a C1 C6 alkyl acrylate together with a crosslinking monomer and a graft linking monomer and a hard final stage comprising, completely or predomi nantly, a C1 C6 alkyl methacrylate and ii a copolymer of an alpha olefin an at least one monomeric compound selected from a C1 C6 alkyl acrylate, a C1 C6 alkyl methacrylate, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, or a mixture of any of the foregoing monomers. The amounts of modifiers to be employed may vary broadly but, in general, best results will be obtained when the compositions comprise from about 10 to about 90 parts by weight of the aromatic polycarbonate resin a i , from about 90 to about 10 parts by weight of the poly ester carbonate copolymer resin a ii , and from about 3 to 10 parts by weight of impact modifier combination b as measured by weight percent of a i and a ii . More particularly in the impact modifier combination b , the multiphase composite interpolymer b i comprises from about 2 to about 9 parts by weight and the copolymer of an olefin and an aforedescribed comonomer b ii comprises from about 1 to 3 parts by weight, based upon the weight of the polycarbonate and copolyestercarbonate.In especially preferred compositions the aromatic polycarbonate resin a i comprises from about 75 to about 25 parts by weight and the poly estercarbonate copolymer resin a ii comprises from about 25 to about 75 parts by weight. The addition of the modifiers may be accomplished in any manner so long as a thorough distribution of the modifiers in the aromatic carbonate polymer resin mixture a is obtained. The mixing of these materials may be accomplished by a variety of methods normally employed for incorporation of plasticizers or fillers into thermoplastic polymers, including but not limited to, mixing rolls, dough mixers,Banbury mixers, extruders, and other mixing equipment.The resulting mixtures may be handled in any conventional manner employed for the fabrication or manipulation of thermoplastic resins. The materials may be formed or molded using compression, injection, calendering, extrusion and blow molding techniques, alone or in any combination. Also multi processing methods, such as extrusion blow molding or co extrusion co injection can be used, e.g., for multi layer containers It should be understood that the resin mixtures prepared in accordance with the invention may also contain, in add tior, to the above mentioned polymers, other additives to lubricate, reinforce, prevent oxidation, or lend color to the material. Other additives, such as mold release agents and stabilizers are well known in the art, and may be incorporated without departing from the scope of the invention. The aromatic polycarbonate resins for use nerein as component a i may be prepared by reacting a dihydric phenol with a carbonate precursor, such as phosgene, a haloformate or a carbonate ester. Generally speaking, such carbonate polymers may be typified as possessing recurring structural units of the formula EMI7.1 wherein A is a divalent aromatic radical of the dihydric phenol employed in the polymer producing reaction.Preferably, the carbonate polymers used to provide the resinous mixtures of the invention have an intrinsic viscosity as measured in methylene chloride at 25eC. ranging from about 0.30 to about 1.00 dl. g. The dihydric phenols which may be employed to provide such aromatic carbonate polymers are mononuclear or polynuclear aromatic compounds, containing as functional groups two hydroxy radicals, each of which is attached directly to a carbon atom of an aromatic nucleus.Typical dihydric phenols are 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane hydroquinone resorcinol 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl pentane 2,4 dihydroxydiphenyl methane bi s 2 hydroxyphenyl methane bis 4 hydroxyphenyl methane bis 4 hydroxy 5 nitrophenyl methane 1, 1 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl ethane 3, 3 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl pentane 2,2 dihydroxydiphenyl 2,6 dihydroxynaphthalene bis 4 hydroxydiphenyl sulfone bis 3,5 diethyl 4 hydroxyphenyl sulfone 2,2 bis 3,5 dimethyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propane 2,4 dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone 5 chloro 2,4 dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone bis 4 hydroxyphenyl diphenyl sulfone 4,4 dihydroxydiphenyl ether 4,4 dihydroxy 3,3 dichlorodiphenyl ether 4,4 dihydroxy 2,5 dihydroxydiphenyl ether and the like.

These aromatic polycarbonates can be manufactured by known processes, such as, for example and as mentioned above, by reacting a dihydric phenol with a carbonate precursor, such as phosgene, in accordance with methods set forth in the above cited literature and U.S. 4,018,750 and 4,123,436, or by transesterification processes such as are disclosed in U.S.3,153,008, as well as other processes known to those skilled in the art. It is possible to employ two or more different dihydric phenols or a copolymer of a dihydric phenol with a glycol or with a hydroxy or acid terminated polyester or with a dibasic acid in the event a carbonate copolymer or interpolymer rather than a homopolymer is desired for use in the preparation of the polycarbonate mixtures of the invention. Branched polycarbonates are also useful, such as are described in U.S. 4,001,184.Also there can be utilized blends of a linear polycarbonate and a branched polycarbonate. Moreover, blends of any of the above materials may be employed in the practice of this invention to provide the aromatic polycarbonate. In any event, the preferred aromatic carbonate polymer for use as component a i herein is a homopolymer derived from 2,2 bis 4 hydroxylphenyl propane bisphenol A . The poly ester carbonate copolymer resins a ii for use in the subject invention may generally be described as copolyesters comprising recurring carbonate groups,EMI10.1 carboxylate groups,EMI10.2 and aromatic carbocyclic groups in the linear polymer chain, in which at least some of the carboxylate groups and at least some of the carbonate groups are bonded directly to ring carbon atoms of the aromatic carbocyclic groups.These poly ester carbonate copolymers, in general, are prepared by reacting a difunctional carboxylic acid, a dihydric phenol and a carbonate precursor.

In the dihydric phenol compound represented by Formula II above, when more than one Y substituent is present, they may be the same or different. The same is true for the R substituent. Where s is zero in Formula II and u is not zero, the aromatic rings are directly joined with no intervening alkylene or other bridge. The positions of the hydroxyl groups and Y on the aromatic nuclear residues A can be varied in the ortho, meta, or para positions and the groupings can be in a vicinal, asymmetrical or symmetrical relationship, where two or more ring carbon atoms of the aromatic hydrocarbon residue are substituted with Y and hydroxyl group. Examples of dihydric phenol compounds that may be employed in this invention include 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane bisphenol A 2,4 dihydroxydiphenylmethane bis 2 hydroxyphenyl methane bis 4 hydroxyphenyl methane bis 4 hydroxy 5 nitrophenyl methane bis 4 hydroxy 2,6 dimethyl 3 methoxyphenyl methane 1,1 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl ethane 1,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl ethane 1, 1 bis 4 hydroxy 2 chlorophenyl ethane 1,1 bis 2,5 dimethyl 4 hydroxyphenyl ethane 1, 3 bis 3 methyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propane 2,2 bis 3 phenyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propane 2,2 bis 3 isopropyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propane 2,2 bis 4 hydroxynaphthyl propane 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl pentane 3,3 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl pentane 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl heptane bis 4 hydroxyphenyl phenylmethane bis 4 hydroxyphenyl cyclohexylmethane 1,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl 1,2 bis phenyl propane 2, 2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl l phenylpropane and the like.

In general, any difunctional carboxylic acid or its reactive derivative such as the acid halide conventionally used in the preparation of polyesters may be used for the preparation of polyester carbonates useful in formulating the compositions of the present invention. In general, the carboxylic acids which may be used include the aliphatic carboxylic acids, aliphatic aromatic carboxylic acids, or aromatic carboxylic acids. The aromatic dicarboxylic acids or their reactive derivatives such as the aromatic diacid halides are preferred as they produce the aromatic polyestercarbonates which are most useful, from the standpoint of physical properties, in the practice of the instant invention. These carboxylic acids may be represented by the general formula EMI15.1 wherein R represents an alkylene, alkylidene or cycloaliphatic group in the same manner as set out above for E in Formula II an alkylene, alkylidene or cycloaliphatic group containing ethylenic unsaturation an aromatic radical such as phenylene, naphthylene, bisphenylene, substituted phenylene, etc. two or more aromatic groups connected through non aromatic linkages such as those defined by E in Formula II or a divalent aliphatic aromatic hydrocarbon radical such as an aralkyl or alkaryl radical. Rê is either a carboxyl or a hydroxyl group. The letter q represents the integer one where R2 is a hydroxyl group and either zero or one where R2 is a carboxyl group. Thus the difunctional carboxylic acid will either be a monohydroxy monocarboxylic acid or a dicarboxylic acid.For purposes of the present invention the aromatic dicarboxylic acids or their reactive derivatives such as, for example, the acid halides, are preferred. Thus in these preferred aromatic dicarboxylic acids, as represented byFormula III, R2 is a carboxyl group and R1 is an aromatic radical such as phenylene, biphenylene, napthylene, substituted phenylene, etc., two or more aromatic groups connected through non aromatic linkages or a divalent aliphatic aromatic radical. Some nonlimiting examples of suitable preferred aromatic dicarboxylic acids which may be used in preparing the polyestercarbonate resins of the instant invention include phthalic acid, isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid, homophthalic acid, o , m , and p phenylenediacetic acid, the polynuclear aromatic acids such as diphenic acid, and l,4 naphthalic acid. These acids may be used individually or as mixtures of two or more different acids. The carbonate precursor may be either a carbonyl halide, a carbonate ester, or a haloformate.The carbonyl halides which can be employed herein are carbonyl chlorides and carbonyl bromide. Typical of the carbonate esters which may be employed herein are diphenyl carbonate, di halophenyl carbonates such as di chlorophenyl carbonate, di bromophenyl carbonate, di trichlorophenyl carbonate, di tribromophenyl carbonate, etc., di alkylphenyl carbonates such as di tolyl carbonate, etc., di naphthyl carbonate, di chloronaphthyl carbonate, phenyltolyl carbonate, chloronaphthyl chlorophenyl carbonate, and the like.

The preparation of polyester carbonates which are to be employed in the compositions of the present invention is described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,030,331 3,169,121 3,207,814 4,194,038 and 4,156,069. The polyestercarbonates which are useful in the practice of the present invention include the aromatic polyestercarbopnates derived from dihydric phenols, aromatic dicarboxylic acids or their reactive derivatives such as the aromatic diacid halides, and phosgene. A quite useful class of aromatic polyestercarbonate is that derived from bisphenol A, isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid, or a mixture of isophthalic acid and terephthalic acid, or the reactive derivatives of these acids such as terephthaloyl dichloride, isophthaloyl dichloride, or a mixture of isophthaloyl dichloride and terephthaloyl dichloride, and phosgene.The molar proportion of dihydroxydiaryl units to benzenedicarboxylate units to carbonate units can range from about 1 0.30 0.90 0.70 0.10 and the molar ratio of terephthalate units to isophthalate units can range from about 9 1 to 0.3 9.7. The compositions of the subject invention further comprise an impact modifier combination b comprising i a multiphase composite interpolymer having a first elastomeric core stage of a C1 C6 alkyl acrylate together with a crosslinking monomer and a graft linking monomer and a hard final stage of completely or preponderantly, a C1 C6 alkyl methacrylate and ii a copolymer of an olefin and at least one of a C1 C6 alkyl acrylate1 a C1 C6 alkyl methacrylate, acrylic acid, meth acrylic acid, or a mixture of any of the foregoing. Impact modifier combination b generally comprises from about 3 to about 10 weight percent of a i and a ii , and in greater detail, multiphase composite interpolymer component b i comprises from about 2 to 7 parts by weight and copolymer component b ii comprises from about 1 to 3 parts by weight, by weight of the polycarbonate and copolyestercarbonate. Multiphase composite interpolymer component b i is an interpolymer comprising about 25 to 95 percent by weight of a first elastomeric phase and about 75 to 5 percent by weight of a final rigid thermoplastic phase. One or more intermediate phases are optional.For example, a middle stage polymerized from about 75 to 100 percent by weight styrene may be included. The first stage of multiphase composite interpolymer component b i is polymerized from about 75 to 99.8 weight percent C1 to C6 alkyl acrylate resulting in an acrylic rubber core having a Tg below about 100C. and crosslinked with G.1 to 5 weight percent crosslinking monomer and further containing 0.1 to 5 percent by weight graftlinking monomer. The preferred alkyl acrylate is butyl acrylate. The crosslinking monomer is a polyethylenically unsaturated monomer having a plurality of addition polymerizable reactive groups all of which polymerize at substantially the same rate of reaction. Suitable crosslinking monomers include poly acrylic and poly methacrylic esters of polyols such as butylene diacrylate and dimethacrylate, trimethylol propane trimethacrylate, and the like, diand trivinyl benzene, vinyl acrylate and methacrylate, and the like. The preferred cross linking monomer is butylene diacrylate.The graftlinking monomer is a polyethylenically unsaturated monomer having a plurality of addition polymerizable reactive groups, at least one of which polymerizing at substantially different rate of polymerization from at least one other of said reactive groups. The function of the graftlinking monomer is to provide a residual level of unsaturation in the elastomeric phase, particularly in the latter stages of polymerization, and consequently, at or near the surface of the elastomer particles. When the rigid thermoplastic phase is subsequently polymerized at the surface of the elastomer, the residual unsaturated addition polymerizable reactive group contributed by the graftlinking monomer participates in the subsequent reaction so that at least a portion of the rigid phase is chemically attached to the surface of the elastomer.Among the effective graftlinking monomers are allyl group containing monomers of allyl esters of ethylenically unsaturated acids such as allyl acrylate, allyl methacrylate, diallyl maleate, diallyl fumarate, diallyl itaconate, allyl acid maleate, allyl acid fumarate, and allyl acid itaconate. Somewhat less preferred are the diallylesters of polycarboxylic acids which do not contain polymerizable unsaturation. The preferred graftlinking monomers are allyl methacrylate and diallyl maleate.A most preferred interpolymer has only two stages, the first stage comprising about 60 to 95 percent by weight of the interpolymer and being polymerized from a monomer system comprising 95 to 99.8 percent by weight butyl acrylate, 0.1 to 2.5 percent by weight butylene diacrylate as crosslinking agent, 0.1 to 2.5 percent by weight allyl methacrylate or diallyl maleate as graftlinking agent with a final stage polymerized from about 60 to 100 percent by weight methyl methacrylate. A preferred two stage interpolymer of this type is commercially available under the tradename, ACRYLOID KM 330, fromRohm Haas Chemical Company. The final stage monomer system can be comprised of C1 to C6 methacrylate, styrene, acrylonitrile, alkyl acrylates, allyl methacrylate, diallyl methacrylate, and the like, as long as the overall Tg is at least 200C. Preferably the final stage monomer system is at least 50 weight percent C1 to C4 alkyl methacrylate. It is further preferred that the final stage polymer be free of units which tend to degrade poly alkylene terephthalates , for example acid, hydroxyl,amino, and amide groups. The multiphase composite interpolymers are prepared sequentially by emulsion polymerization techniques wherein each successive outer stage coats the previous stage polymer. By way of illustration, the monomeric C1 C6 acrylate, the cross linking monomer and the graft linking monomer are copolymerized in water in the presence of a free radical generating catalyst and a polymerization regulator which serves as a chain transfer agent, at a temperature on the order of from 150C to 800C. The first elastomeric phase is formed in situ to provide a latex of the core copolymer. Thereafter, the second rigid thermoplastic phase monomers are added and are emulsion polymerized with the core copolymer latex to form the interpolymers. Any of the well known free radical generating catalysts which polymerize methyl methacrylate or acrylates per se may be utilized in the emulsion polymerization. Suitable catalysts are, for example, those of the organic peroxide type, such as methyl ethyl ketone peroxide and benzoyl peroxide those of the hydroperoxide type, such as cumene hydroperoxide those of the persulfate type, such as potassium persulfate, or catalysts such as azoisobutyronitrile. Thus, the usual water soluble as well as the monomer soluble types of catalysts may be employed. Amounts of catalysts used are normally within the .05 to 0.5 parts by weight of the monomers used. Polymerization regulators suitable for use in the process are those organic sulfur compounds such as thioacids, high molecular weight mercaptans such as benzyl mercaptan, aliphatic mercaptans having at least six carbon atoms per molecule such as octyl, dodecyl and tertiary dodecyl mercaptan, mixtures of mercaptans such as are obtained for example from lauryl alcohol, nitrohydrazine, amino compounds, carbon tetrachloride and similar well known polymerization modifiers or regulators. Alkyl mercaptans of low water solubility such as n dodecyl mercaptans or tertiary dodecyl mercaptan are preferred. Amounts of modifier added to control the rate of polymerization may be within the range of about 0.2 to 5 by weight of the monomers used. Coagulation of the interpolymerized product is then effected with a calcium chloride solution, for instance, whereupon it is filtered, washed and dried. The coagulated interpolymer may also be filtered through cheesecloth and spray dried at inlet outlet temperatures of 1500C 500C to provide a free flowing powder. These and other suitable composite interpolymers for use herein as component b i and their preparation are more fully described in U.S. 4,034,013 and 4,096,202, incorporated herein by reference. Impact modifier combination b also comprises as component b ii a copolymer of an olefin and at least one monomeric compound selected from the group consisting of a C1 C6 alkyl acrylate, C1 C6 alkyl methacrylate, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid and a mixture of any of the foregoing. Copolymer component b ii is made from an olefin, e.g., ethylene, propylene, or the like, copolymerized with one or more of a comonomer comprising a C1 C6 alkyl acrylate, e.g., methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, hexyl acrylate and the like a C1 C6 alkyl methacrylate, e.g., methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, hexyl methacrylate, and the like acrylic acid or methacrylic acid. Especially preferred are the well known copolymers of ethylene with an alkyl ester of acrylic. acid. These are disclosed inU.S. 2,953,551. Generally, the acrylate or methacrylate portion of the copolymer can range from about 10 to about 30 weight percent. The olefin portion of the copolymer can range from about 70 to about 90 weight percent.The preferred copolymer for use as component b ii is an ethylene ethyl acrylate copolymer in which the weight ratio of the ethylene fraction to the ethyl acrylate fraction is about 4.5 to 1. Suitable olefin acrylate copolymers, as defined above, can be prepared by methods well known to those skilled in the art or can be obtained commercially. For example,Union Carbide s Bakelites DPD 6169 ethylene ethyl acrylate copolymer is suitable for use in the present invention. The compositions of the subject invention may be prepared by dry blending the aromatic carbonate polymer resin component a and impact modifier combination component b until complete dispersion of all of the ingredients is obtained. The resin mixtures are then extruded and chopped to form pellets and thereafter molded in accordance with conventional methods. The resistance to impact failure of the polycarbonate resin mixtures prepared in accordance with the subject invention was determined in accordance with the Notched Izod Impact Test, ASTM D256 on molded test specimens in the form of bars of two sizes 2 1 2 x 1 2 x 1 8 and 2 1 2 x 1 2 x 1 4 , the latter dimension being the specimen thickness. The test specimens were mounted in accordance with ASTM D256 procedures and were tested at room temperature.

At a pH of between about 9 10.5, 1089.6 grams 5.37 moles of a mixture of 15 by weight of isophthaloyl dichloride and 85 by weight of terephthaloyl dichloride in 2 liters of methylene chloride is added over a 10 minute interval while controlling the pH at about 9 10.5 with 35 aqueous caustic.After the addition of the diacid chloride mixture, phosgene is added at a rate of 36 grams per minute for 12 minutes while controlling the pH at about 10 11 with 35 aqueous caustic. The polymer mixture is diluted with 2 liters of methylene chloride and the brine phase is separated. The resulting polymer phase is washed once with 0.1 HC1 and three times with water and is then recovered by high steam precipitation to yield a white powder. This preferred poly estercarbonate copolymer has molar ratios of dihydroxy diaryl units to benzene dicarboxylate units to carbonate units of about 1 0.6 0.75 0.4 0.25 and a molar ratio of terephthalate units to isophthalate units of about 8.5 1.5. The resin mixtures were prepared in the following manner An aromatic polycarbonate derived from 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane and having an intrinsic viscosity iv in the range of from about 0.46 to about 0.49 dl g as determined in a methylene chloride solution at 250C. LEANS 140, General Electric Company was mixed with a poly estercarbonate copolymer resin as above prepared. The components were mixed in a laboratory tumbler until well mixed. Thereafter an impact modifier combination comprising a multiphase composite interpolymer having a rubbery first stage comprising n butyl acrylate with an allyl methacrylate graft linking monomer, and a butylene acrylate crosslinking monomer and a hard final stage comprising methyl methacrylate ACRYLOID KM 330, Rohm Haas Chemical Company and an ethylene ethyl acrylate copolymer DPD 6169,Union Carbide Company was added. The ingredients were then blended together by mechanically mixing them in a laboratory tumbler and the resulting mixture was fed to an extruder which was operated at about 5400F. The resulting extrudates were comminuted into pellets. The pellets were infection molded at about 500OF. into aforesaid test specimens of about 1 1 2 x 1 2 x 1 8 and 2 1 2 x 1 2 x 1 4 .The weld line strength of the samples was measured with the specimens prepared in a double gate mold in the same way as the notched Izod samples. When polymer melt was injected through the gates, a weld line was then formed in the center of the sample. Measurements were made according to ASTM D256.The numerical superscripts indicate the percent of test sepcimens which were ductile and the superscript H indicates that the sample failed in a hinged mode, which is an improvement over brittle failure. The sample labeled control was bisphenol A polycarbonate containing no modifier or an incomplete modifier combination as indicated.

The compositions prepared in accordance with the subject invention wherein the polycarbonate component comprises a mixture of an aromatic polycarbonate resin and a poly ester carbonate copolymer resin and impact modified in accordance with the teachings of this invention, exhibit unexpectedly improved impact strengths at room temperatures and over a variety of as molded thicknesses. Each of the above mentioned patents, applications and publications are specifically incorporated herein by reference. Although the subject invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments, many obvious modifications or changes may be made therein or will suggest themselves to those skilled in the art. For example, instead of a bisphenol A polycarbonate, one containing units derived from tetramethylbisphenol A or from dixylenol sulfone can be used as component a i . Instead of a poly ester carbonate based on terephthalate and isophthalate units, naphthenate units may be substituted for either. Instead of a multiphase composite interpolymer having an n butyl acrylate core, one having an ethyl acrylate core could be used. Instead of an ethylene ethyl acrylate copolymer, propylene may be substituted for olefin component or there can be used copolymers of ethylene and methyl methacrylate, ethylene and acrylic acid and ethylene and methacrylic acid, to name but a few of the variations possible. All such obvious modifications are within the scope and spirit of the subject invention as defined by the appended claims.
