## Description
Direct expansion evaporator, particularly for water refrigeration. SpecificationThis invention relates to a direct expansion evaporator which, in contrast with similar well known evaporators, is built and arranged so as to be easily acce ssible and cleaned by conventional tools.The present evaporator shows a particular utility in the refrigeration of water and the like in heat pumps and refrigerating machines. Background of the inventionAs it is well known, a water evaporator is a heat exchanger wherein one of two fluids performs an evaporative process by absorbing heat from the other fluid water or a water solution , said other fluid undergoing a temperature decrease.Said evaporators are usually utilized in refrigerators wherein a fluid performs a thermodynamical cycle comprising, among others, a condensation and an evaporation.Water evaporators are divided into two classes socalled flooded evaporators and direct expansion evaporators. Both of them comprise a bundle of usually horizontal tubes preferably made of copper alloy rigidly connected to a pair of tube sheets at the ends thereof. The bundle of tubes is in turn contained within a cylindrical shell, said tube sheets forming the base surfaces of said shell.In the flooded evaporators, water flows inside said tubes, while the evaporating fluid flows outside the tubes between said tubes and the outer shell. A liquid phase of the evaporating fluid is thus present in the lower part of the shell and a vapor phase in the upper part.The evaporating fluid, as in the liquid phase, always contains a certain amount of oil coming from the lubricating system or the like, which, as it fails to evaporate, remains entrapped in the evaporator.This is a major drawback in evaporators of said type, which have to be provided with a device for removing said lubricating oil.In direct expansion evaporators the evaporating fluid flows inside the tubes and it moves at a given flow rate or speed.Again a certain amount of oil will accumulate as the fluid, in which said oil was dissolved, evaporates however, said oil in the liquid phase will be easily entrained with the vapor flowing together with said liquid inside the tubes.In this arrangement, water flows between tubes and shell, following a sinuous path formed by means of circular partitions spaced at intervals. Water flows therefore in a direction on the whole transversal with respect to the copper tubes, reversing at intervals its direction by 1800. The copper tubes are positioned in a triangular pattern or in any other compact arrangement so that the gaps through which the water flows are not easily accessible. For this reason in such evaporators an absolutely clean water or a closed circuit for the water is required to be used, as the continuous settling of substances dispersed in said water, also aided by the sinuosity of said path, could lead even to a complete choking of the passage.Moreover, a cleaning of the evaporator, although necessary, can hardly be effected by mechanical means as the inner areas thereof are of difficult accessibility. Summary of the inventionThe main object of this invention is to remove the above mentioned drawbacks by providing an evaporator which appears in its operating features to be intermediate between a direct expansion and a flooded evaporator.The evaporator according to the invention is built up of first metal tubes steel, copper or the like having a diameter of moderate size, usually smaller than 100 mm and larger than 50 mm, within which second tubes of narrower diameter 5 to 20 mm are placed, in such a number as to uniformly fill the inner cross section of the first tube enclosing said second tubes. Water flows in the narrow second tubes, while the evaporating fluid flows in the room between said narrow tubes which, as an example, are seven in number and the inner wall of the enclosing first tube.The flow passage cross section for the evaporating fluid is so established that said fluid has a sufficient flow rate to eliminate the drawbacks related to the oil entrapment in the conventional flooded evaporators.Water flows in the narrow tubes of circular cross section countercurrently to the evaporating fluid. Said narrow tubes can be easily and readily serviced and cleaned by removing end covers which are demountably fixed to the respective tube sheet, thus eliminating the drawbacks of conventional direct expansion evaporators.In order to increase the heat exchanging power, the narrow or inner tubes in which water flows, can be provided with fins on their outer surfaces which are in contact with the evaporating fluid. Brief description of the drawingsThe invention will be further illustrated in the following description of a preferred embodiment shown for an illustrative and not limitative purpose, with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein figure 1 isvapartially broken, side sectional view of the evaporator according to the invention, generally taken on line I I of figure 2 figure 2 is a vertical section on line Il Il of figure 1, showing an arrangement of the first tubes of a comparatively large diameter with an associated tube sheet figure 3 is a vertical section on line III III of figure 1 showing the arrangement of the second tubes of comparatively narrow diameter figure 4 is a sectional view on line IV IV of figure 1 of a large tube in which narrow tubes provided with fins are contained and figure 5 is an isometric fragmentary view of an assembly of a large tube enclosing a plurality of narrow tubes. The preferred embodimentReferring to the drawings, there is generally indicated in 1 a direct expansion evaporator according to the invention, which, in the embodiment as shown, comprises a bundle of first tubes 2 open at both ends, having a comparatively large cross section, for example a diameter from 50 to 100 mm, which are fixed in a well known way to respective inner tube sheets 3, 4 at the ends thereof. Preferably, twelve tubes 2 are provided.Each of said tubes 2 encloses a plurality seven, in the illustrative embodiment of second tubes 5 open at both ends, having a comparatively narrow cross section, for example a diameter from 5 to 20 mm.In the illustrated embodiment, said narrow tubes 5 are provided with fins 6 and are conventionally fixed to respective outer tube sheets 7, 8 at the ends thereof. As shown in figure 1, the narrow tubes 5 project beyond both the ends of the large tubes 2 and the outer tube sheets 7 and 8 are spaced by means of peripheral walls 9, 10 from the adjacent, inner tube sheet 3, 4 of the narrow tubes 5, thus forming with said sheets 3, 4 two inner chambers or inner headers 11, 12.Each pair of adjacent tube sheets 3, 7 and 4,8, respectively, are connected together in a demountable manner for example by means of peripheral bolts 13.Tube sheet 3 has at the bottom an inlet port 14 for the evaporating fluid and at the top an outlet port. 15 for the same fluid. Header 11 is divided by a partition wall 16 so that the fluid entering through the port 14 is caused to flow from left to right looking at figure 1 in the lower row of tubes 2 and from right to left in the upper rows of tubes 2, following the path indicated by arrows F and finally to go out through the outlet port 15.To each outer tube sheet 7, 8 of the narrow tubes 5, a cover 17 and 18 respectively is secured, preferably by screws not shown , so as to form two end chambers or outer headers 19 and 20 respectively. The cover 17 has an upper port 2 for water inlet and cover 18 has a lower port 22 for water outlet.Each of the outer headers 18, 20 is provided with a partition 23 and 24 respectively which divide the same into two sections. Partitions 23, 24 are so positioned as to cause the water going in the inlet port 21 to pass through the narrow tubes 5 following a sinuous path, as indicated by arrows F2, countercurrently to the evaporating fluid arrows F1 , before going out of the evaporator through the outlet port 22.It is obvious that the shape, arrangement and number of partitions and inlet and outlet ports can be suitably chosen according to necessity.Furthermore the direct expansion evaporator herein illustrated as in a horizontal position, could also be set in an inclined or even vertical position with minor adjustments.It is understood from the foregoing that servicing and cleaning of inner parts of the evaporator according to the invention, particularly of the narrow tubes 5 wherein the water flows, can be carried out with great ease simply by demounting the covers 17, 18 after unscrewing the respective screws which engage the outer tube sheets 7, 8. If required, also the outer tube sheets 7, 8 could be removed by unscrewing the bolts 13 for inspecting the large tubes 2. To the latter end, according to the invention, preferably the narrow tubes 5 are fixed to the respective outer tube sheets 7, 8 by means of discs 25 secured by screws to the outer tube sheets 7, 8, said discs 25 being provided with an annular seal or 0 ring not shown in detain for coupling and tight sealing the tubes 5 to the outer tube sheets 7,8. It will be understood that the present invention is not restricted to the above illustrated embodiment as modifications and variations could be envisaged by those skilled in the art, all falling within the scope of the invention as claimed.
