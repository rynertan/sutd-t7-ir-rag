# Impingement food preparation apparatus.

## Abstract
An oven for preparing food comprising an enclosure 20 having a conveyor 156 received therethrough for conveying food to be prepared through the enclosure. Positioned within the enclosure and about the conveyor portion therein are ducts 210 for impinging heated air against the food product, a plenum 176 connected to the ducts for supplying heated air to the ducts, and an impeller 302 for recirculating the air within the enclosure for reheating and subsequent passage to the plenum and ducts. A heating source 326 is provided within a heating chamber 308 on the opposite side of the plenum from the ducts, and control components are provided for regulating the temperature of the heat source. The impeller assembly and the plenum are unique in that air drawn from the heating chamber by the impeller assembly is axially and radially urged into the plenum for substantially uniform distribution to the ducts communicat ing with the plenum. The impeller assembly and the plenum also uniquely provide for the air flow to be reversed in a very short distance. Furthermore, the structure of the impeller assembly and plenum provide at various points tapering walls, which permit air to flow thereover in a non turbulent manner, thereby eliminating dead spots or stagnant air pockets.
