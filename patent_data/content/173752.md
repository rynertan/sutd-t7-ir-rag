# PROCESS FOR PRODUCING MELTING ANISOTROPIC, COPOLYMERIZED POLYESTER.

## Abstract
A process for producing melting anisotropic, copolyme rized polyester containing alkylene therephthalate, which comprises reacting a starting polyester composed of dicar boxylic acid and diol with a hydroxy aromatic carboxylic acid to form a copolymerized oligomer, conducting acylation reaction by adding an acylating agent, then conducting polycondensation reaction to produce a melting anisotropic, copolymerized polyester having a logarithmic viscosity of at least 0.2 dl g. This process can afford a product having good physical properties with good efficiency.
