# HIGH FREQUENCY HEATER.

## Abstract
High frequency heater which heats an article to be heated by induction. For the high frequency oscillation source, this heater is constructed so as to divide the output of a single semiconductor oscillator 1 into two parts by a power distributor 2 , the two outputs are amplified by power amplifiers 3 , 4 , and are supplied to a heating chamber 7 by two antennas A₂ , A₃ respectively. The phases of the radio waves are controlled so as to produce the electric power in the heating chamber 7 .
