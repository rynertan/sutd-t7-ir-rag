# Guided beam display device.

## Abstract
The display device is of the kind having within an evac uated envelope at least one electron beam guide 30, 32 across one end of which extends a line cathode 42 which generates at least one electron beam directed into the guide for eventual deflection towards cathodoluminescent screen on a front wall of the envelope. A pair of parallel modula tion electrodes 44a, 44b for each beam is positioned with the cathode 42 between them. Each modulation electrode partially overlaps the associated electron beam guide to eliminate adverse effects of contour differences or misalignment of the edges 48 of these electrodes.
