# Method of manufacturing a semiconductor device containing a Schottky barrier, and device.

## Abstract
The surface of an epitaxial layer 23 of a substrate 21 is ex posed in a window 26S in an insulating layer 26. A layer 28 of polycrystalline or amorphous semiconductor is formed in the window 26S. The layer 28 in the window 26S is monocrystal lized by irradiation with an energy beam, for example a laser beam. A metal electrode 31S is applied over the monocrystal lized part 28S of the layer 28 in the window 26S. A Schottky barrier is formed between the metal electrode 31S and the monocrystallized layer part 28S.
