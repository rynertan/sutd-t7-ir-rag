# Safety support system.

## Abstract
A safety support system 10 in which an annular safety support 44 of resilient material 46 having an outer diameter less than the inner diameter of the tire 12 is positioned around a rim 36 and within the tire 12 . The resilient material 46 of the safety support is under pressure and reinforcing cords 60 are wrapped around the annular safety support to control expansion and maintain the safety support in position between the bead portions in the deflated condition of the tire. The resilient material 46 may be of foam having closed cells containing gas under pressure or it may be a generally solid material which is compressed upon installation or formed under pressure in the tire. The safety support may also have safety support flanges 104, 106 at the edges for positioning between folded portions of the tire sidewalls during operation of the tire in the deflated condition. The sidewall supporting flanges are reinforced by generally radial cords 160, 162 extending around the sidewall supporting flanges for stiffening and resisting bending of the flanges during operation of the tire in the inflated and deflated condition.
