# Antistatic compositions and sheet materials formed therefrom.

## Abstract
A hydroxyorganosilane composition which upon curing provides a polymer that is an electrical conductor is dis closed. The composition comprises 1 to 95 weight percent of a hydrolyzate of a hydroxyorganosilane and optionally up to 50 weight percent of a silanol sulfonate compound. When the cured polymer, which has a siloxane backbone, is a film in a composite structure, the resultant article has antistatic properties.
