# Process and apparatus for producing thermoplastic resin foam.

## Abstract
In a process for producing a thermoplastic resin foam which comprises continuously heat foaming a foamable ther moplastic resin sheet containing a heat decomposable organ ic blowing agent with a heated gas, the improvement wherein a gas containing sublimation products generated by the heat foaming of the foamabie sheet is burned to decompose the sublimation products and obtain a treated gas having a sub stantially reduced content of the sublimation products, and the treated gas is then used as the heated gas for the heat foam ing of the foamable sheet and a apparatus for producing a thermoplastic resin foam by continuously heat foaming a foam able thermoplastic resin sheet, said apparatus comprising a heat foaming chamber having an inlet portion for feeding the foamable thermoplastic resin sheet, an outlet portion for dis charging the foamed sheet, a discharge port for a gas contain ing sublimation products generated by the heat foaming of said foamable sheet, and a supply port for a heated gas, said discharge port and said supply port being connected by pipe lines to form a circulating pipe line, and said circulating pipe passage having a burning device for burning said gas contain ing sublimation products.
