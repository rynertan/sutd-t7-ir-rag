# Impact modified polyglutarimide compositions and methods of making them.

## Abstract
In the compositions and methods of the invention the impact resistance of polyglutarimide is improved by the blending therewith of at least two multiple stage polymer impact modifiers, said impact modifiers having rubbery cores and hard polymer shells, at least one of said impact modifiers having a core polymerized predominantly from butadiene and at least one other having a core polymerized predomin antly from C₂ C₆ alkyl acrylate. In preferred compositions and methods like hard polymer shells of at least one of each of said impact modifiers comprises methacrylate, styrene, and or acrylonitrile units. The combination of the specified impact modifiers demonstrates synergism in a balance of the impact properties of the polyglutarimide.
