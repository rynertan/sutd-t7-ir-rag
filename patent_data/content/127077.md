# A rotatable drill bit.

## Abstract
Shortening of the bit life and prematue failure of cutting elements 88, 70 on a rotating bit 32 near or at the gage 64 of the bit 32 can be avoided by disposition of the cutting elements 88 at or below a key level 72 on the shoulder to gage transition. A first tooth is placed on the shoulder of a rotating bit at the key level 72 . The key level 72 is defined as that point on the shoulder 62 of the rotating bit 32 at which a tooth 74 extends radially from the axis 54 of the rotating bit 32 by a distance substantially equal to the diameter of the bore drilled by the rotating bit 32 as also defined by the gage 64 diameter of the rotating bit 32 . Below the key level 72 the teeth 74 are set on the pads in a staggered pattern that serve to increase effective cutting element concentration. The staggered pattern is repeated within a pad and between pads in selected areas. Distinguishable cutting elements are alter nated within the pattern.
