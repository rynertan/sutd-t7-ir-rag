# Heat shrinkable article.

## Abstract
A heat shrinkable article comprising 1 a heat shrinkable layer of polymeric material, 2 a laminar heater wnich comprises a conductive polymer layer sandwiched between apertured metal electrodes and which is secured to the inner surface of the layer, and 3 a member which is secured to the inside of the heater and which protects a substrate from damage caused by the heater when the layer shrinks. The protective member 3 has a first shape before the layer shrinks and a second shape after the layer shrinks. The member possesses sufficient strength to resist piercing by the electrodes when the layer shrinks. Such articles are particularly useful for enclosing splices in telephone cables. Also disclosed is a method for protecting a substrate using the above described protective member.
