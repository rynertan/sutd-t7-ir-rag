# Narrow gap electrolysis cells.

## Abstract
A narrow gap electrolysis cell has anode and cathode compartments 10, 11 divided by an ionically permeable separator 12 , such as an ion exchange membrane or a fibrous diaphragm, and a current feeder grid 18, 19 in electrical contact with a surface activated particulate electrocatalytic material 14, 15 carried on a face of the separator 12 . The particulate material has cores of a corrosion resistant material preferably valve metal particles or sponge, or compounds thereof, as well as asbestos fibres and fibres of ion exchange copolymeric perfluorocarbons, coated with a platinum group metal catalyst in metal or oxide form. The surface activated particles may be at least partly carried by a flexible electronically conductive foil 16, 17 between the current feeder grid 18, 19 and the separator 12 .
