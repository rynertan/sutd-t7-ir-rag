# Apparatus for nondestructively measuring characteristics of a semiconductor wafer having a junction.

## Abstract
To nondestructively measure the carrier lifetime and cutoff frequency of a semiconductor wafer 1, 2 having a junction, the apparatus of this invention comprises means 10, 12, 14 for inradiating the wafer 1, 2 with a pulsated photo beam 3 frequency of which is change able, means 9 for taking out the resulting photo voltage by capacitance coupling, and means 15 for calculating the carrier lifetime and cutoff frequency from the chopp ing frequency dependence characteristics of this photo voltage.
