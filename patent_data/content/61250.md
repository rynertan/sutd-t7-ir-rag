## Description
IMPROVED PROCESS FOR RECOVERING PRODUCTS PRODUCED BY HOST ORGANISTS TECHNICAL FNET D OF INVENTION This invention relates to methods for producing proteins, polypeptides or other products in host organisms.More particularly, it relates to a method for recovering a desired protein, polypeptide, or other product from a host organism which produces that product. The method of this invention is characterized by the step of exposing the host organism to at least one cqmposition which causes lysis or at least permeabilizatlon of the host and release of the desired product into the culture medium in recoverable form. As will be appreciated from the disclosure to follow, the method of this invention is generally useful in the production of various proteins, polypeptides and other products in various host organisms. b BACKGROUND ART One of the problems that besets the large scale production of proteins, polypeptides and other prdducts in potentially hazardous host organisms is how to inactivate or kill the host organiss of the culture while at the same time being able to recover the desired product. This problem has become even more important because of the development of recombinant DNA technology.Such technology permits the production of foreign products in host organisms that have been transformed with foreign DMA sequences that code for thdse products. Examples of such processes include the production of human insulin, human interferons, hepatitis B viral antigens, foot and mouth disease viral antigens, and human growth hormone in bacteria and other host organisms. Two general approaches to this problem have been employed in the prior.art. In the first of these, the host organisms of the growing culture are inactivated under appropriate conditions of physical containment, by heat, acid or other inactivating treatment before harvesting.Then, the inactivated host organiBms are harvested and the desired proteins or polypeptides are recovered. In the second of these prior approaches, the host organisms are harvested and extracted under conditions of physical containment, as required by the appropriate governmental guidelines and regulations. Then, any live cells remaining are inactivated or killed as before and the desired proteins or polypeptides are recovered. However, neither of these approaches has proven satisfactory in the recovery of desired products from large volume fermentations of host organisms which produce those products. For example, in the case of the microbial production of human leukocyte interferon IFN a fromE.coli transformed with a DNA sequence that codes for IFN a such microorganisms being for example, described in European patent application 81. 300050.2, filed January 7, 1981, which application is incorporated herein by reference the fir.st general approach inactivating the transformed host organisms by either heat, acid or other inactivatlng treatment followed by harvesting gave a yield of not more than about 10 of the interferon or interferon like products produced by the microorganisms. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the other products of the host organism complex with or occlude the desired interferon product and prevent its recovery from the inactivated and harvested culture. The second general approach, while perhaps usable on a laboratory scale, is technically difficult to implement on a larger scale. For example, the complexity and expense of fermentation and processing equipment to provide the required containment during harvesting and extraction of large scale cultures of living cells is high. Moreover, the procedures which must be employed are bulky and not preferred, both from an equipment and peqsomv standpoint. DISCLOSURE OF T2iE INVENTION The present invention solves the problems referred to by providing a method for recovering a desired protein, polypeptide or other product from a host organism which produces that product. By virtue of this invention, it is possible to release into the culture medium in recoverable form substantially all of the desired protein, polypeptide or other product produced by the host organism, while.at the same time inactivating the host organism. The improved process of this invention is therefore distinguishable from the prior processes, above described, in that this process affords substantially the complete recovery of the desired products from a culture of host organisms and at the same time avoids the disadvantages of the prior art processes. BEST NODE OF CARRYING OUT TEE INVENTION In order that the invention herein described may be more fully understood, the following detailed description is set forth. In this description the term host organism is usedbroadly. For example, it includes both gram negative and gram positive bacterial hosts such as strains of E.coli, e.g., E.coli HB101, E.coli X1776, E coli X2882, E.coli DS410, E.coli MRCI, and strains ofPseudomonas, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus stearec.hermophil√πs and other bacilli, yeasts, and other fungi, animal or plant hosts such as animal including human or plant cells in culture or other hosts. The selection of a particular host is not part of this invention.Rather the invention is applicable generally to the recovery of products from all hosts that are lysable or at least permeablizable on exposure to the compositions of this invention. In addition, the process of this invention is applicable to a wide variety of proteins, polypeptides and other products. For example, the recovery of products such as the active component2 c vaccines or other phz .2 ceutically or internally useful compositions, enzymes, alkaloids, amino acids, industrial chemicals, antibiotics, food stuffs, and the like are part of this invention.Again, the selection of a particular product is not part of this invention. Rather, the inventin is applicable generally to the recovery of all such desired products. Finality, the numerous techniques and processes for growing or fermenting cultures of host organisms or the purification of products from them are not part of this invention. Rather, this invention is a useful complement to those techniques and enables the improved recovery of the desired product from them. It should, of course, be understood that not every host or every growth or parification tecenisue may be usefully employed to produce a specific product in a particular host organism by the processes of this inventionRather, those of skill in the art should consider various factors known in the art to select a preferred host and preferred conditions for the production and purification of a desired product For example, a wide variety of host cloning vehicle combinations have been employed in recombinantDNA technology to prepare transformed host organisms that produce a desired foreign product. For example, useful cloning vehicles may consist of segments of chromosomal, non chromosomal and synthetic DNA sequences, such as various known bacterial plasmids, e.g., plasmids fromE.coli including cal El, pCRl, pBR322 and their dernvatrveE wider host range plasmids, e.g., RP4 phage DNA, e.g., the numerous derivatives of phage A, e.g., NM989 and vectors derived from combinations of plasmids and phageDNAs such as plasmids which have been modified to employ phage DNA or other expression control secuences or yeast plasmids such as 2y plasmids or derivatives thereof. Various DMA sequences may be put into those cloning treatment. And, yeast cells are more susceptible toGlusulase commat . The various compositions, described above as illust ative of the compcsiiiors useful in the process of this invention, have a well known spectrum of activities against various host organisms. Therefore, the choice of a composition in accordance with this invention for a particular application must be governed by a number of factors. These include the susceptibility of the host organism to the composition, the susceptibility of the host organism after transformation, if any, with a hybrid plasmid to the composition,. the activity and stability of the composition in the culture medium, the stability of the desired product in the culture medium and in subsequent processing steps and any interaction between the compositic and the desired product.Using these principles, one of skill in the art may choose a particular composition within the scope of this invention and usefully employ the process of this invention in the recovery of a desired product. The schedllle for ersosing the host organism to the chosen composition in the process of this invention is also governed to some extent by the particular host organism, composition employed and the products desired. For example, some treatments like lysozyme EDTA followed by exposure to SDS requre that the growth of the culture of host organisms be substantially,complete before begin the release of the product. On the other hand, exposure to penicillin or its derivatives, such as ampicillin c other like acting compositions, permits a wide variety, of schedules to be followed. For example, the amount of the composition added, the time in the host organism growth.cycle of the addition, the number of additives, the number of additions or the period of host organism growth after addition and before product recovery are all subjec to modification by those of skill in the art without departing from the scope of this invention. vehicles at well recognized sites in them to produce hybrid DNA molecules. These molecules are useful, either as produced or after appropriate modification to improve their expression characteristics or to modify the product actually, expressed from them, to transform host organisms, as described above, and to produce the products coded for by the i ns√´rted DNA sequence s or desired fragments thereof. illustrative of the foreign products that have been produced by such transformed host organisms are hepatitis B viral antigens, foot and mouth disease viral antigens, leukocyte interferon, fibroblast interferon, the A and B chains of human insulin, rat growth hormone, mouse dihydrofolate reductase, somatostatin, human growth hormone and the like. Within n the above general technology, the present invention is characterized by the step of exposing a host organism to at least one composition to which the host organism responds by lysing or at least becoming permeable so as to release the desired prpduct made by it into the culture medium. These compositions fall into two general classes. The first class dissolves the lipids of the cell membrane and destroys the impermeability of the host organism. Examples of this class are detergents such as triton and sodium dodecyl sulfate 11SDS11 and enzymes such as GlusulaseQ a 8 glucuronidase sulfatase preparation The second class disrupts the cell envelope of the host organism or blocks enzymes required by the cell wall system.Examples of this class are penicillin, cycloserine, bacitracin, zancomycin, ristocetin, polymyxin and their derivatives, synthetic, semi synthetic or natural. It is of course, to be understood that certain host organisms are more susceptible to one class or member of a class of compositions than others. For example, human cells are readily susceptible to nonionic and ionic detergents. On the other hand, E. coli cells are more susceptible to exposure to penicillin or its derivatives or to exposure to SDS following a lysozyme EDTA In a batch process, a portion of the culture may be removed at intervals and treated as above to recover the desired product while the remaining culture continues to grow and to produce the desired product. In a continuous process, the desired product may be re covered as above from the medium stream after it has passed through the immobilized or otherwise located culture of host organisms. In order that this invention may be better understood, the following examples are set forth. These examples are for purposes of illustration only and this invention should not be considered to be limited by any recitation used therein. Example I E.coli DS 10 ss Lac AUG a2 , an E.coli DSfl10 ara azide Ton A lac y Tsx min a min b gal A xyl stepR strain, was transformed with plasmid beta lac AUG alpha 2 as described in the above identified European patent application. It is deposited in the American Type CultureCollector under ATCC No. 31769 The transformed host contains the IFN f2 gene connected via an AUG initiator codon to the penicillinase ss lac expression control sequence of pBR322. The host is resistant to tetracycline and streptomycin. It was grown to a cell density of 5x109 OD650 6 in a 120 1 culture at 30 C and a sample arrayed to determine how much IFW had been produced by the host organisms.The culture medium consisted of casamino acids enzymatic casein hydrolysate C 0626,Sigma 30 g l , glycerol 98 PHEVE, pure, Siegfried 20 g lf, yeast extract BBL 2 g l , KE2PO4 pure, p.A. Fluka 5 g l , NaOs p.A. Merck, No. 6As8 1.2 g l ,Silicone DX31DB Dow Chemical 0.1 ml l , MgSO4.7R20 Merck, z.Analyse, No. 5886 1 g l and NaOE as above ca 2 g l . Aeration and agitation were carried out to The medium was prepared by autoclaving the casamino acids, glycerol, yeast extract, KH2PO4 and silicone for 20 min at 1200C. After cooling the MgSO4 7E20 in 1 mlH2O, which had been separately autoclaved as above, was added and the pH adjusted to 7 with NaOB in E2O. For example, in one embodiment of this invention a single large dose of penicillin was added to a growing microorganism culture at the end of its growth period.Any host organisms remaining after the time selected for exposure were then inactivated and the desired product recovered. In a second example, the concentration of the penlcillill in the culture was kept at a low, more or less, constant level to permit the microorganisms to continue to grow and to produce the desired product at about the same rate that microorganisms were being lysed or at least permeablized by the penicillin to release the desired product. Therefore, proper choice of addition schedules may allow an approximate steady state condition to be approached in the culture. Such procedures are plainly useful in semi continuous and continuous fermentation and recovery processes. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the process of this invention causes lysis or at least permeibilization of a portion or all of the host organisms of the growing culture and the release of the desired products made by those host organisms into the culture medium The non lysed portion of the culture, if any, of course may continue to grow and to produce the desired product until it is lysed or permeabilized by the process of this invention or otherwise inactivated In a non continuous process, the fermentation is ended at some time, preferably by the addition of a sufficient amount of the composition of this invention.Then, any host organisms remaining in an unlysed state are killed by acid or heart treatment, whichever is more favorable to the stability of the desired product. The product is then isolated and purified in an appropriate fashion. For example, acid stable, acid precipitable products. e.g. IFN a, IFN B are purified by precipitation with acid and recovered by extraction, Other products are recovered from the cleared lysate by absorption to ion exchange resins or affinity resins or by precipitation with any of a variety of well known additives, such as salts, metal ions and the like. ensure not less than 80 dissolved oxygen relative to air at atmospheric pressure at any time. The pH was kept to 7 by addition of lOM NaOE. 75 mg l of ampicillin a penicillin derivative were added at OD6se 6 and aeration and agitation continued as before. After the OD6se decreased to 4 30 60 min , the culture was then cooled to 100C and E2SO4 ca 4 MW was added slowly to adjust the pE to 1.9. In some instance trichloroacetic acid was employed to adjust the pE to 1.3 so as to favor complete precipitation of the desired IFN product. The precipitate was collected by a Westphalia separator and the concentrated solids centrifuged to a paste in a Sharples. The paste about 133g l, moist was suspended in 5X its weight of deionized water, homogenized with a Silverson homogenizer and the PE adjusted to 7..2 with 2 M NaOE about 31 of NaOE are usually required .An assay revealed that substantially all of the IFN produced by the host organism.had been recovered. This harvested and extracted IFN cr may then be treated in a variety of ways to purify it. As above stated, these subsequent techniques are not part of this invention. Example II E.coli DS410 B lac AUG a2 , described above, was grown to a cell density of 109 mI. under the same conditions and using the same culture medium as described above. Again, a sample was assayed to determine the level of IFN production. Fifteen g of ampicillin per ml of culture were then added and incubation continued under full aeration and agitation. No increase in living cells was noted so presumably the fraction of the cells being lysed or at least permeabilized by the ampicillin and releasing IFN a2 into the medium was being replaced, at least insofar as the limit of detection used, by the remaining cells continued division.These cells, of course, continue to produce additional IFN a2. After about 1 hour, an assay showed as high a titer as 200 x 106 units of IFN 1. The culture was then treated as described in example I and substantially all of the IFN activity recovered from the culture in the acid precipitate. Example III A 1 1 culture of E. coli DS410 ss Lac AUG a2 , described above, was grown at 37aC in the culture medium described above to a cell density of about 1010. The culture was then incubated with 20 mM EDTA, 100 pg ml lysozyme for 30 min at 37 C and then lysed with 0. SDS.After cooling to lOaC, the lysate was adjusted to pE 2 with sulfuric acid and allowed to stand for 60 min so as to kill all of the remaining cells. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation and homogenized with water 1 20 original culture volume , while adjusting the pB to 7.3 with NaOR. Removal of the insoluble matter gave a clear solution having 50 100 of the original IFN a activity. In this instance, further purification of the IFN a was difficult presumably because of IFN complexing with the hydrophobic membrane proteins also extracted by the SDS. Such complexing, of course, should not be a disadvantage in the recovery of other non interferon products. While we have hereinbefore presented a number of embodiments of this invention, it is apparent that our basic construction can be altered to provide other eiLodi ments which utilize the processes and compositions of this invention. Therefore, it will be appreciated that the scope of this invention is to be defined by the claims appended hereto rather than the specific embodiments which have been presented hereinbefore by way of example.
