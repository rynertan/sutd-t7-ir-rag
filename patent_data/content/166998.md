# Medical instrument and method for making.

## Abstract
A medical instrument comprises a substrate which has at least on its surface a reactive functional group covalently bonded with a water soluble polymer or derivative thereof, whereby said surface has lubricity when wetted. The water soluble polymer is a cellulosic polymer, maleic anhydride polymer, polyacrylamide or water soluble nylon. The medical instrument is prepared by treating a substrate with a solution of a compound having a reactive functional group to form an undercoat so that the reactive functional group is present at least on the substrate surface, and then treating the substrate with a water soluble polymer or derivative thereof to covalently bond the reactive function al group with the water soluble polymer to thereby form a coat of the water soluble polymer on the undercoat and optionally, contacting the treated substrate with water.
