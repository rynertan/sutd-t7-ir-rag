# Preparation of monolithic catalyst supports having an integrated high surface area phase.

## Abstract
A method of preparing a monolithic catalyst support having an integrated high surface area phase as provided. A plasticized batch of ceramic matrix material intimately mixed with high surface area powder is formed into the desired shape for the monolith and then heated to sinter the ceramic. The resulting monolith has a strong substrate of the ceramic matrix material and a high surface area phase provided by the high surface area powder extruded with the batch.
