# Credit card systems.

## Abstract
A highly secure dispensing system, particularly for public utility products such as electricity, gas or district heating, requiring identifying information on both a master card and a value card to be found compatible before a quantity of the commodity can be dispensed which is commensurate with a value on the value card.

## Claims
Claims 1. A commodity dispensing system having token reading means and commodity dispensing means, characterised in that the system includes a master token carrying information, a value token carrying both identifying information and value information, the token reading means has reading means by which the identifying information carried by the master token can be read, reading means by which the identifying information carried by the value token can be read, and comparator means by which the identifying information read from the value token can be compared with that read from the master token, and the commodity dispensing means is operable only upon the comparator means finding the compared information to be compatible to dispense a quantity of the commodity compatible with the value information carried by the value token. 2. A system as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the master token is in the form of a card with the information carried thereby being in a form which can be read magnetically. 3. A system as claimed in either Claim 1 or Claim 2, wherein the value token is in the form of a card with the information carried thereby being in a form which can be read magnetically. 4. A system as claimed in any one of the preceding Claims, wherein the reading means by which the identifying information carried by the master token can be read as the same as the reading means by which the identifying information carried by the value token can be read and storage means is provided between the reading means and the comparator means such that the identifying information read from the master token can be stored after removal of the master token from the reading means so that such information is retained subsequently to be compared in the comparator means when the reading means later reads the identifying information carried by the value token. 5. A system as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 3, in which the reading means by which the identifying information carried by the master token is read as separate from the reading means by which the identifying information carried by the value token is read, the two tokens then needing to be both in position relative to the respective reading means to be read by its respective reading means at the same time. 6. A system as claimed in any one of the preceding Claims, wherein the value token carries information indicative of a series of sub values, the system being such that upon insertion of the value token into the reading means and the comparator means finding the compared information comptible, the dispensing means is rendered operable thereby to dispense a quantity of the commodity compatible with one of the series of sub values, cancellation means also being provided in the system to cancel said one of the series of sub values. 7. A system as claimed in any one of Claims 1 5, wherein the system further includes capturing means by which, upon the dispensing means being rendered operable, the value token is captured and held against further re use by the capturing means. 8. A system as claimed in any one of the preceding Claims, wherein the commodity is that of a public utility.

## Description
Credit Card SystemsThis invention relates to commodity dispensing systems and more particularly, although not exclusively, to such systems for dispensing a predetermined quantity of a public utility such as electricity, gas, water or district heating.Fraud of commodity dispensing systems and particularly those of public utilities, is by no means uncommon as do also the public utilities suffer a high level of bad debts . The present invention seeks to obviate these problems by providing a credit card type of system which can be made highly secure and obviate the need for cash meters.The present invention provides a commodity dispensing system having token reading means and commodity dispensing means, characterised in that the system includes a master token carrying information, a value token carrying both identifying information and value information, the token reading means has reading means by which the identifying information carried by the master token can be read, reading means by which the identifying information carried by the value token can be read, and comparator means by which the identifying information read from the value token can be compared with that read from the master token, and the commodity dispensing means is operable only upon the comparator means finding the compared information to be compatible to dispense a quantity of the commodity compatible with the value information carried by the value token. The two tokens may each be in the form of cards with the information carried thereby being in a form in which it can be read magnetically.The reading means by which the identifying information carried by the master token can be read may be one and the same as the reading means by which the identifying information carried by the value token can be read and, in this case, storage means may be provided between the reading means and the comparator means such that the identifying information read from the master token can be stored after removal of the master token from the reading means so that such information is retained to be subsequently compared in the comparator means when the reading means later reads the identifying information carried by the value token.In the alternative, the reading means by which the identifying information carried by the master token is read may be separate from the reading means by which the identifying information carried by the value token is read, the two tokens then needing both being in position to be read by its respective reading means at the same time.The value token may carry information indicative of a series of sub values, the system then being such that upon insertion of the value token into the reading means and the comparator means finding the compared identifying information compatible, the dispensing means is rendered operable thereby to dispense a quantity of the commodity compatible with one of the series of sub values, cancellation means then being provided in the system to cancel said one of the series of sub values alternatively, the system may have a capturing means by which, upon the dispensing means being rendered operable, the value token is captured and held against further re use by the capturing means.One embodiment of the present invention will now be described in greater detail, by way of example only.The credit card system here below described is for the purpose of controlling the metering of the flow of hot water within a domestic property connected to a district heating system.Affixed to the meter in the domestic property is a token reader and commodity dispensing equipment which controls the meter to dispense a quantity of hot water compatible with a value read by the equipment. The equipment is designed to accept both a master magnetically encoded card and a value magnetically encoded card.The customer is issued with the master card which carries thereon identifying information.Issue points are provided by the district heating authority at which are located encoders. Upon the customer inserting into the encoder both his master card and a sum of money, the encoder would issue an appropriate number of value cards each having a unit value. On each of these value cards there would be encoded the identifying information carried by the customer s master card. The customer then obtains an amount of hot water compatible with the value of the value card by inserting his master card into the master card reading means and the value card into the value card reading means both provided in the card reader and commodity dispensing equipment affixed to his meter. The equipment includes comparator means by which the identifying information read from the master card by the master card reading means and the identifying information on the value card read by the value card reading means is compared. If these two sets of identifying information are found by the comparator to be compatible, dispensing means within the equipment allow the meter to dispense a quantity of hot water compatible with the value of the value card.Capturing means within the equipment then captures and retains the value card to prevent its further re use.The customer may then, or at a later time, insert a further value card which allows a further quantity of hot water compatible with the value of the value card to be delivered.The equipment may include erasure means by which, when the value card has been captured by the equipment, the value magnetically encoded on the value card is automatically erased.The system above described is highly secure in that the value cards are of no use unless accompanied by the .mas√ße card the identiXyin.g infor r.ation on which has been copied onto the value card. Thus, if the value card is stolen it is of no use unless the corresponding master card has also been stolen with it.The security of the system can further be enhanced by the encoder at the issue point recording how many value cards have been purchased for each master card.Particularly if the erasure facility is provided, the system s security is further enhanced by the value cards having their magnetically encoded value erased upon use of the card to obtain the facility of the compatible quantity of hot water. Each customer may be allocated a pass code which the customer is required to key in to the encoder at the issue point at the time of presentation of his master card to obtain the value cards. The encoder would then check the pass code keyed in by the customer against a similar code magnetically encoded on the master card and value cards only being issued when these two pieces of information were consistent. This would further help to reduce fraud.Whilst the above described embodiment has been described with reference to a district heating system, clearly the credit card system could equally well be used for dispensing. other public utilities such as gas or electricity. Indeed, the system could be used for dispensing products as well as public utility services.In the above described embodiment, the equipment has been described as requiring the simultaneous positioning of the two cards in their respective reading means. This may not necessarily be so. Only but a single reader may be provided into which the master card and the value card are sequentially inserted. In this case, the identifying information on the master card would first be read and storage means would be provided in the equipment to hold this information until the identifying information on the value card had been read by the reading means and compared in the comparator with the held identifying information read from the master card.
