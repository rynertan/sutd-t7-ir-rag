## Description
Apparatus for conveying lengths of magnetic material. The present invention relates to conveying substantially flat or sheet like lengths of magnetic material, such as flat or profiled metal sheets, especially for stacking such lengths discharged from a shears or cutting means.The apparatus is of the kind comprising an endless belt conveyor with an upper and lower part, a device for receiving said lengths and transferring them to the conveyor, and a device for removing the conveyed lengths from the conveyor, the conveyor being adapted for conveying the lengths in a suspended condition under its lower part, the conveyor comprising magnet means for retaining the lengths in the suspended condition. Within the metalworking industry, e.g. in manufacturing building sheeting, enamelled goods, sheet metal partition walls, etc., one often starts from material typically cold rolled thin sheet in the form of a sheet web rolled into a coil. The coil, which can have a weight of about 5 10 tonnes, is placed in an apparatus for drawing the sheet web out and parting or cutting it into lengths or format sheets of a definite size, typically about 1 x 2 m, with the help of shears or a cutting mechanism. After parting, which can take place at a through rate of about 30 40 meters minute as much as 75 meters per minute, in some cases , the format sheets thus obtained are removed continuously and laid in stacks.Stacking can be done selectively to form several different stacks, depending on the format or quality of the sheets, or to enable the removal of a stack which cannot accept any more sheets. It will be understood without difficulty that stacking in accordance with the above requires rapid and reliable apparatus to convey the individual sheets for stacking, preferably in more than one stack. There is a corresponding demand for conveying apparatus with stacking potential also in many process lines, e.g. for coating format plates with paint, plastics or the like, or in sorting and classifying lines and sheet profiling lines. A plurality of various conveying apparatuses permitting stacking in accordance with what has been said above has been previously proposed. Examples of typical apparatus working with endless conveying apparatus are the so called vacuum stacker, which utilizes an endless belt conveyor having suction cups mounted thereon and circul ating therewith, said cups dependently carrying a sheet to be stacked, and stackers utilizing an endless belt conveyor having magnets fixed between the upper and lower parts of the conveyor, these magnets holding sheets which, as a result of friction action, are brought to accompany the lower part of the conveyor in a suspended state. Both these types of stacker utilize endless conveyors having full width, i.e. an unbroken transverse extension which is substantially equal to the width of the sheets to be conveyed and stacked.For the endless conveyors, this results in belt sag problems with associated limitations with respect to length and width. All of the known types of stacker have complicated apparatus, which is not csily variablc, for setting down conveyed sheets in one or more pre detennined stacks. As far as the vacuum stacker is concerned, the sheets which are to be stacked must also be ci cnn and unaffected by rust, as well as being completely flat.For the other kind of stacker, the friction between the underside of the conveyor lower part and conveyed sheets on the one hand, and between the upper side of the conveyor lower part and the fixed magnets on the other hand, make special demands on the surface structure of the affected surfaces, and the friction drive between the lower part of the conveyor and the conveyed sheets requires a specific contact surface to function satisfactorily, which puts special demands on the flatness of the sheets. In summary, it can thus be established that the known types of conveying and stacking apparatuses using endless belt conveyors each have many disadvantages, such as expensiveness, complicated setting down apparatus, the requirement of special surface flatness or structure of the conveyed sheets, limited dimensions for the endless conveyor, lack of flexibility and adaption to different conveying and stacking tasks. The object of the present invention is therefore to provide new apparatus of the kind mentioned in the introduction, with which the above mentioned drawbacks are avoided while other advantages are also gained. This object is achieved by the apparatus in accordance with the invention being given the characterizing features disclosed in the accompanying patent claims. The apparatus in accordance with the invention is thus substantially distinguished in that the endless belt conveyor comprises a plurality of endless belts running alongside of and parallel to each other, the lower parts of these belts forming the lower track of the conveyor, the edge portions of the lower parts being supported and gtlitlctl in l clt edge guide mcalls at least at intervals so that a sag of tllc belt lower parts troll u desired track is si stantialiy prevented, in that said magnet means comprise permanent magnet means distributed consecutively along each of the endless belts and mounted on the outside of the belts for retaining coaction with the upper surface of the lengths daring conveyance of said lengths, and in that the device for setting down or removing conveyed lengths comprises deflecting means arranged at and or insertable in the conveying track for the lengths, for coaction with the front edge of a conveyed length, so that the length is given a curved course and thereby tipped or tilted in relation to the permanent magnet means retaining the length, whereby the grip between the permanent magnet means and the length ceases and the length can fall freely from the endless belt conveyor.Suitably the permanent magnet means are limitedly movably mounted on the outside of the belts, so that the means can adjust themselves to irregularities and slants of the surface of the lengths with which said means coact during conveyance of the lengths. It is hereby advantageous if the permanent magnet means include pole shoes intended to engage against the surface of a conveyed length and which are limitedly movably disposed relative to the respective belt. The pole shoes preferably have extension substantially transversely relative to the associated belt, and can be pivotably mounted substantially transverse to the associated belt for enabling limited pivoting movement in the longitudinal direction of the associated belt and or limited movement in a direction towards and away from the associated belt. To advantage, said deflecting means comprises means, preferably with fork or finger like arresting or deflecting members, which are adapted for being moved down into coaction with a length, between the lower parts of the belts, for setting down tile length. The means can suitably include gliding surfaces which, when disposed actively, are slanting in relation to the conveying track and thereby deflect a front edge of a conveyed plate in a direction away from the conveying track. The device for receiving the lengths and transferring them to the endless belt conveyor can suitably comprise roller means coacting with a feed portion of the conveyor lower part, the lower parts of the endless belts not being edge guided at said feed portion and the roller means being so disposed that utilizing the springiness of the belts in a direction away from the belts, they ensure engagement between a fed in length and the permanent magnet means. An apparatus made in accordance with the invention has been found, inter alia, to provide the following advantages no problems with sag of the belts of the endless belt conveyor, which can be made optionally long and wide small, simple and cheap permanent magnet means can be utilized no special requirements for the length to be handled, and these can be irregular, profiled etc. division into a plurality of endless belts and the guid ance of these gives stable and uniform operation with the possibility of higher speed, less driving power, lower belt costs, and the possibility of lower belt tension completely free space under the conveyor, no sag or voluminous removing or setting down devices the possibility of simple redisposition of the setting down location the possibility of simple adjustment of the endless belts transversely to suit a particular working task easy, uncomplicated and rapid setting down positive feed to the endless belt conveyor, no demands on exact positioning when lengths are fed into the conveyor generally uncomplicated, operationally reliable and convenient for service. The above and other distinguishing features of and advantages with an apparatus in accordance with the inven tion will be more clearly understood from the following description of an embodiment while referring to the appended drawing comprising seven figures. Figure 1 is a schematic side view of a plant for cutting up a continuous sheet web into format sheets and for taking away and stacking said sheets, the endless belt conveyor incorporated in the plant being shown greatly simplified. Figure 2 is a partial cross sectional view of the endless belt conveyor, said view showing the construction of the lower sheet conveying track of the conveyor by means of the lower parts of four endless belts, guided in their edge portions and outwardly provided with permanent magnets.Figure 3 is a schematic partial longitudinal sectional view illustrating the arrangement of a controllable removing or setting down means also indicated in Figure 1 , the downwardly swung working attitude of the means and its action in this position on a forwardly conveyed sheet is shown by dashed lines, the section being taken along the line III III in Figure 4.Figure 4 is a schematic partial view from above of the setting down means according to Figure 3. Figure 5 is a schematic partial side view of the feed portion of the endless belt conveyor and roller means arranged at said portion for ensuring engagement between a fed in plate the permanent magnet means on the outside of the endless belts. Figures 6 and 7 are a partial cross sectional view and a partial longitudinal sectional view, respectively, illustrating the design of a permanent magnet means and its attachment to the associated endless belt, the view according to Figure 6 being taken along the line VI VI in Figure 7 and the view according to Figure 7 being taken along the line Vil Vil in Figure 6. The plant in accordance with the invention, shown on the drawing, comprises a conventional cutting section consisting of a frame 1 for a coil 2 of sheet 3, which is to be parted into format sheets, straightening apparatus 4 and cutting apparatus 5, a roller conveyor 6 for re ceiling and further conveyance of cut off format sheets 20, an endless conveyor 7 connected to the roller conveyor 6 and two stacking stations 8,9 arranged under the endless belt conveyor to receive sheets 20.The conveyor 7 comprises four parallel and horizontally extending endless belts 101, iso2, 103 and 104. At either end of the conveyor, the endless belts 10 are taken over associated driving pulleys and tension or return pulleys 11 and 12, suitably mounted on the frame 13 of the conveyor 7. The belts 10 and the rollers of the roller conveyor 6 are driven synchronously in a way not more closely shown but obvious to ti ose skilled in the art, i.e. so that sheets 20 fed from the roller conveyor 6 to the belt conveyor 7 travel at substantially the same speed as the belts. The lower parts of the endless belts 10 form the conveying track of the conveyor, which is thus horizontal in the example shown.The belts 10 are relatively narrow but arranged spaced and in such plurality that the conveying track is given the desired width. The belts can, for example, have a width of about 10 cm and be arranged with a mutual centre distance of about 30 cm. The conveying track thus obtained is suitable for conveying sheets 20 with a width of up to about 120 cm. The belts 10 are provided with permanent magnet means 15 on their outsides, said means being arranged consecutively along the centre of each belt at a centre spacing of about 15 cm in this example. The lower part edge areas of the belts 10 are supported and guided substantially along the whole length of the conveyor 7, possibly with the exception of a minor especially formed feed portion, the importance which will be accounted for later. As will be seen best fromFigure 2, said edge areas of the belts 10 are guided in belt edge guiding means comprising profiles or sections 18 with an L shaped cross section, and being disposed along the lower parts of the belts, two profiles for each belt. The edge areas of each belt thus rest on substantially horizontal supporting and sliding surfaces, formed by the flat leg or flange portions of each pair of L section which face each other.The upstanding legs of the L sections in each pair of L sections are spaced from each other at a slightly greater distance than the width of the associated belt 10. The sections 18 are attached, for example, in cross ties or bars 19 not more closely shown forming a part. of the frame 13 of the conveyor 7. It will be seen that the sections can be fastened simply to the cross ties 19 so that they are displaceable sideways, i.e. so that the spacing between the belts 10 can be adjusted. This naturally requires the corresponding availability of transverse adjustment for the rollers 11 and 12, which is very easy to arrange since the rollers are mounted on a common shaft.The ability to adjust the belts in this way, with respect to their mutual spacing, enables conveying profiled sheets, for instance, of different kinds and with different transverse spacing between upstanding profile portions with which the permanent magnet means can coact. It will also be understood that the upper parts of the belts 10 can be supported in a suitable way between the rollers 11 and 12 if this should be required, especially for very long conveyors. As will be seen from Figure 1, the plant shown is provided with two setting down or relinquishing devices 25 and 16 for selectively relinquishing or setting down a conveyed sheet 10 at the first stack 8 or the second stack 9. The setting down device 25 is suspended in the frame 13 of the conveyor 7 above the lower track of the conveyor, namely in the space between the upper and lower parts of the conveyor. The device 25, which will be described in detail with reference to Figures 3 and 4, is adapted, for relinquishing a sheet 20, to coact with the front edge of the latter via means which are momentarily brought down into the track of the sheet between the lower parts of the endless belts 10. The device 26 is mounted at the end of the conveyor and is therefore rigidly mounted.Its active means arranged in the track of a sheet 20 and between the lower parts of the belts 10 are however principly the same as the downwardly thrustable means of the device 25, and therefore only the device 25 will be described in detail. The device 25 comprises see Figures 3 and 4 a fork e means 31 pivotably suspended above the lower parts of the endless belts 10. The means 31 comprises a cross member 32 extending across the conveyor, and five fingers or deflecting elements 33 projecting from it in the longitudinal direction of the conveyor. The cross member 32 is pivotably arranged on a cross shaft 34, at its ends mounted in the frame 13. The cross member and thus the fingers 33 can thus pivot vertically about a horizontal axis. The fingers 33 are located between the endless belts 10 and at the sides thereof resp., and can thus be swung downwards between the lower parts of the belts and at the sides thereof, resp. without coming into contact with, or disturbing the belts.The operating mechanism of the device 25 comprises a pistoncylinder unit, the cylinder 35 thereof being pivotably mounted in a transverse shaft means 36 attached to the frame 13 while the piston rod 37 thereof is pivotably attached to a bracket 38 upstanding from the cross member 32. When the piston of the piston cylinder unit is pulled in and thereby the piston rod 7 is withdrawn, the fork means 31 assumes the position shown by full lines in Figure 3, i.e.with the fingers 33 in a substalltial y horizontal attitude, or in other words parallel to the endless belts 10. When the piston of the unit is thrust out and thereby the piston rod 37 is pushed forward, the fork means 31 will pivot about the shaft 34 down to the inclined attitude shown with dashed lines, for coaction with a sheet 201 which is to be deposited onto the stack below. When the front edge of the sheet 20 is deflected by the fingers 33, as indicated inFigure 3, the sheet will be made to curve and thus it will be tilted loose from the nearest permanent magnet means 15.It has been found that this situation spreads very rapidly to remaining gripping points between the sheet 201 and the means 15 and that the sheet is relinquished practically immediately. When this has occurred, the fork means 31 can be swung back, if the next sheet is to be set down in the next stack with the help of device 26. As should be understood, device 26 can quite simply consist of a rigidly mounted fork means 36 with a downward inclination. It is emphasized that device 25 can very easily be mounted so that it is displaceable in the longitudinal direction of the frame 13, to allow variation in the location of the stack beneath it. A preferred embodiment of the permanent magnet means 15 will now be described in more detail while referring to Figures 6 and 7. As is apparent from these figures, the means IS has its major extension in a transverse direction.The means is built up on a small U or channel section, with its longitudinal axis transverse to that of the conveyor, the section being riveted to its associated belt 10 with the aid of two rivets 41. A permanent magnet 42 with two pole shoes 43,44 fitted to it are mounted in the channel section. The magnet 42 and pole shoes 43,44 are rectangular flat plates, together having a width which is somewhat lesscr than the width of the inner space of the channel section. I.10C magnet and pole shoes extend down wardly out past the channel section, the pole shoes 43,44 extending further than the magnet 4 and talus Constitute abutment means when there is contact between the permanent magnet means 15 and a carried sheet 20. In a normal positior illustrated in Figures b and 7, the contact surfaces of the pole shoes are substantially horizontal, i.e. parallel to the belt 10. The magnet 42 and pole shoes are pivotably mounted with clearance on a horizontal pin 45, centrally arranged in the channel section and extending in the longitudinal direction of the conveyor. The upper portions of the magnet 42 and pole shoes 43,44 facing towards the web or bottom of the section 40 are at a distance from the bottom of the section such that they can pivot substantially, i.e. until their upper corners reach the bottom of the section. The size of the available pivoting angle in either direction, this angle determining how much the surface of the sheet with which the permanent magnet means 15 is to coact may incline in relation to the belt 10, is normally not critical but can suitably be about 20 30 .As a result of the clearance between the pin 45 and the corresponding mounting holes in the magnet 42 and pole shoes 43,44, and the clearance sideways between the walls or flanges of the channel section 40 and the magnet and pole shoes, the latter also have limited movement to and from the belt 10 and limited pivoting ability in the longitudinal direction of the conveyor. It has been found suitable that the latter should not be greater than about t5 100. It should be emphasized that this latter pivoting ability must naturally not be so great that the tilting action to release a sheet from the permanent magnet means is prevented, or made considerably more difficult. As should be noted, the ability of movement in dilfelellt dilectiol s gives the described permanent magnet means 15 extremely good capacity for adjusting to irre gulal ities and S 1 ants in tllc sheet surface with which the means is to coact. An advantageous embodiment of the transfer between the roller conveyor 6 and conveyor 7 will now be described in more detail with reference to Figure 5. As will be understood, the roller conveyor 6 and the lower track of the conveyor 7, i.c. the lower parts of the belts 10 should be in register with each other such that a sheet 20 can go from being carried by the rollers of the conveyor 6 to retention by the permanent magnet means 15 without any problems.To ensure that the magnet means 15 come into positive engagement with the sheet 20 to be conveyed at the beginning of the conveyor 7, even if the above mentioned registry is not perfect, according to the invention, the lower parts of the endless belts 10 can be without edge guidance in the feed area, while roller means 51 are arranged for sprung coaction with the belt lower parts in this area, a sheet which is fed to the conveyor being brought to pass between the roller means 51 and the belts 10. The roller means 51 are disposed somewhat above the conveying plane of the conveyor 7, the resiliency of the belts 10 being utilized to provide good contact between a fed in sheet 20 and the magnet means 15. To avoid problems with direct contact between the magnet means 15 and the roller means 51, the latter are made with limited transverse extension and are displaced in relation to the belts 10. It is pointed out that the roller means could naturally be suitably spring biassed towards the belts and that corresponding roller means at a suitable height location could also be arranged in a feed area where the belts are guided at their edges in the way alread described.
