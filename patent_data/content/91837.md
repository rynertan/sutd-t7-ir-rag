# Microbiological test processes and apparatus.

## Abstract
An improvement in the method of carrying out a microbial culture test, in which the culture medium of a microorganism under test includes a hydrolysable fluoroge nic substrate which is enzymically hydrolysable to yield a fluorescent material, and in which test the growth is assessed by fluorescence, wherein said improvement com prises inoculating the microorganism into the culture medium at an inoculum concentration within the range 5 10⁴ organisms ml to 10⁶ organisms ml including one or a plurality of hydrolysable fluorogenic substrates in the culture medium with the concentration of each fluorogenic substrate in the medium in the range 30 micromolar to 300 micromo lar and after cultivating the inoculated medium by incuba tion, measuring the fluorescence yield of the culture and retaining the culture in a form suitable for possible further incubation to yield a confirmatory culture result by another method of estimation.
