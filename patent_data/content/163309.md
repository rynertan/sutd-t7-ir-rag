# SPRING COMPRESSOR

## Abstract
A spring compressor for axially compressing a helical coil spring 2 of an automobile and then holding the spring in the compressed position consists of two identical devices 1 mounted on opposite sides of the axial spring 2 which is to be axially compressed. Each device comprises metal plates 5 held together by rollers 7 , the plates 5 having curved hook formations 20 to engage a coil of the spring 2 . A threaded spindle 8 fits into a housing 9 capable of pivoting between these metal plates 5 . A chain 12 is threaded around the coils of the spring 2 which is to be compressed and around the rollers 7 between the metal plates 5 . Threaded on the spindle 8 is a chain adjustment piece 11 through which the chain passes and which moves outwardly along the spindle 8 when the spindle 8 is turned, so as to cause the chain 12 to pull the spring 2 and compress the coils of the spring between the loop of chain 12 and the curved hook formations 20 of the metal plates 5 . A pin 13 inserted in the chain adjustment piece 11 locks the chain 12 in the required position so as to prevent the chain 12 from sliding through the chain adjustment piece 11 , thus maintaining the spring 2 in its compressed position.
