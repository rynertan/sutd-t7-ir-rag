# ALKALINE REFINED GUM AND USE THEREOF IN IMPROVED WELL TREATING COMPOSITIONS

## Abstract
A process for the alkaline refining of gum splits is provided. Also provided are hydraulic fluid fracturing com positions which contain alkaline refined gum and which exhibit superior solution viscosity and low residue after break. Also provided is a method of hydraulic fluid fracturing of the subterraneon formations surrounding a well using such compositions.
