Amaranthus retroflexus L. and Cyperus Iria L. were sowed therein. Successively, a dispersion consisting of 20 liters of water and 300 g of a wettable powder containing a particular compound of the present invention was sprayed on the entire surface of the soil from above the pot using a small sprayer. 20 liters and 300 g are the amounts per one are of the soil area to be sprayed. After this spraying, the pot was placed in a greenhouse for 21 days to examine the herbicidal effect of the compound. The following evaluation criterion was used. The test results are shown in the following table. The present invention compounds have an excellent herbicidal activity and can be used as a herbicide for paddies and gardens. These compounds are particularly effective for paddy weeds such as Echinochloa crus galli L. Beauv. gar crusgalli, Cyperus difformis L., Monochoria vaginalis Presl, Scirpus juncoides Roxb. var. Hotarui Ohwi and Alisma canaliculatum A. Br. et Bouche, as well as for garden weeds such as Panicum Crus galli L. var. frumentaceum Trin., Digitaria adscendens Henr., Polygonum nodosum Pers., Amaranthus retroflexus L., Cyperus Iria L. and Chenopodium album L. var. centrorubrum Makino. In using as a herbicide, the present invention compounds can be diluted to an appropriate concentration as they are or after having been mixed with a carrier, a surfactant, a dispersing agent, an auxiliary chemical, etc. to prepare a wettable powder, an emulsion, a granular, a fine granular or the like and then can be sprayed or directly applied.
