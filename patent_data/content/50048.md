# Anchoring a railway rail fastening clip to a foundation for a railway rail.

## Abstract
An anchoring device has a head part 18 , which anchors the clip and is to lie above the foundation, and a tail part 39 which is to lie in the foundation and is in the form of a single vertical rod. At least one vane 40 , to resist turning of the device about its vertical axis, has its upper extremity 4 joined to the bottom of the head part and has one of its sides 5 joined to the upper portion of the tail part, the vane having a vertical height 6 and a horizontal width 8 greater than its horizontal thickness. At least one projection 46 , below the vane or vanes, projects laterally from the tail part and has a horizontal or nearly horizontal top, the projection or projections serving to resist vertical forces tending to pull the anchoring device vertically upwardly out of the founda tion.
