# Station selecting apparatus.

## Abstract
A station selecting apparatus comprises a preset signal generating circuit in the form of a charging discharging cir cuit 23 including a parallel connection of a variable resistor 231 and a capacitor 232 and being adapted to generate a pulsive preset signal having a pulse width determined by the discharging time constant of the charging discharging circuit 23 . Avariable reactance device which determines the tuning frequency is controlled in accordance with the pulse width of the preset signal. A semifixed resistor 236 is connected bet ween the variable resistor 231 of the circuit 23 and the ground for the purpose of defining the minimum pulse width of the preset signal and a further semifixed resistor 238 is connected in parallel with the variable resistor 231 for the purpose of defining the maximum pulse width of the preset signal, so that the tuning frequency is limited to a predeter mined range.
