# Method and apparatus for expanding tobacco.

## Abstract
Tobacco containing solid carbon dioxide is fed into an expansion chamber 14 in which it is expanded by hot gas the solid carbon dioxide thereby being sublimed and moisture and organic material in the tobacco being volata lised. The gas and expanded tobacco enter a separator 15 from which the tobacco is discharged through a rotary valve 17 . Gas is withdrawn from the separator 15 , a portion of it vented, and the remainder heated by heater 27 and then returned to the expansion chamber 14 . In order substantially to preclude air flowing through the ro tary valve 17 into the separator 15 the pressures below and above the rotary valve are equalised. Alternatively, some of the gas withdrawn from the chamber 15 my be used to isolate the valve 17 from the atmosphere. By precluding air flow into the separator 15 the tobacco may be expanded without using steam other than that evolved from the tobacco or excessive temperatures.
