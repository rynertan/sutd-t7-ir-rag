## Description
EXTRACTON urv OF VFG JABLE O1LS This invention rebates to the extraction of oils from seeds. More particularly, this invention relates to the extraction of oils and proteins from oil seeds by an enzymic process. Oil seeds, e.g. soybeans, peanuts, cotton seeds, sunflower and rape seeds constitute the major source of edible oils. As much as 70 of world production of fats or oils is provided from vegetable sources, more than 20 coming from soybeans. In addition to providing oils, these seeds constitute also an increasingly important source of protein. Two main types of process are commonly employed for the commercial extraction of oils from oil seeds.These are a mechanical expression, and b solvent extraction. Both types of process tend to denature the proteins occurring in the oil seeds, thereby lowering the solubility of the protein extracted, and restricting its utility in food products. There has been a search for improved extraction processes, but this search has been concentrated on aqueous extraction processes, involving centrifugal separation of oil and protein phases. In spite of the expanding interest in recent years in the applications of biotechnology, there appears to have been no disclosure of such a process applied to the extraction of vegetable oils. Indeed, those enzymes occurring naturally in the oil seeds are usually inactivated before the extraction processes generally employed in industry. The purpose of this inactivation step is to avoid decomposition processes leading to rancid and sometimes toxic products. Some proposals have been made for the use of enzymic processes in the extraction of natural products, but these have not included processes for extracting oil from oil seeds. GB A 363463 proposed the separation of fats from vegetable material containing proteins, fats and starches, and more especially the separation of cacao butter, by using proteolytic enzymes to peptize the proteins. GB A 1157415 relates to a process for preparing a protein concentrate from fish comprising digesting fish by enzymic proteolysis, and dissolving resulting fats and oils in an organic solvent to leave a substantially fat free protein concentrate. GB A 1402769 relates to the recovery of oil from grain germs by treatment, at a pH of 3 to 6 and a temperature from 25 to 60 OC , with a cellulase preparation which is substantially free from lipase and lipoxidase activity. The object of this invention is to provide a new and improved process for the separation of vegetable oils from oil seeds. Further objects of the invention will appear hereinafter. The present invention provides a process for the extraction of vegetable oils and protein from oil seeds which comprises contacting oil seeds with water in the presence of at least one added enzyme, and separating the resulting reaction mixture into a solid protein containing fraction, an oil fraction and an aqueous fraction. It has now been found that by carrying out a water extraction of oil seeds, usually at an elevated temperature, in the presence of one or more of a variety of enzymes, it is possible to obtain good yields of the desired vegetable oil, and in addition to obtain a protein fraction which has undergone less denaturing than occurs in the processes conventionally used in industry. Moreover, the oil obtained is of high quality, and does not generally require the elaborate purification commonly necessary to remove the degradation products obtained in conventional extraction processes. The process of the invention even makes .it possible to produce oil from sources not normally considered as oil sources, e.g. melon seeds. A variety of enzymes can be employed in the process of the invention. Indeed it is generally desirable tn employ enzyme mixtures from the same or different sources so that different enzymes may each perform their different functions leading to a more rapid and effective breakdown of the cellular structures in the oil seeds, and more effective release of the oils. Among the types of enzyme that may be employed are X amylase, p glucanase, neutral proteinase, alkaline proteinase, acidic proteinase, pectolytic enzymes, cellulase, and hemicellulase. Specific enzymes that have been effectively employed in the process of the invention are commercially available mixtures, e.g. a mixture of alpha amylase, glucanase and n proteinase from B. subtilis a mixture of pectolytic enzymes and cellulases from A. niger and hemicellulase from A. niger. The enzymic extraction is generally carried out at ambient or at an elevated temperature, for instance 15 to 900C, more preferably 45 to 700C, the actual temperature being one at which the enzymes function well without being deactivated. The pH can also be adjusted during the course of the reaction to a value suitable for the particular enzyme being used. Values in the range from 3 to 8 are generally suitable. Separation of the oil fraction from the reaction product is assisted by the use of a solvent. This can be any water immiscible solvent whose volatility enables its easy recovery, e.g. hexane. This solvent can be present, if desired during the enzymic extraction, or can be added after or preferably before filtration. Such solvents are generally those used in known processes for extraction of oils from seeds. They are, however, generally employed in lower quantities in this invention, because they fulfil a different function, so that there is less expenditure of energy on solvent recovery. In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, . the extraction process is carried out by size reducing the oil seeds to a desired particle size. The resulting particles are contacted with water, suitably with stirring or other agitation, at a temperature of from 15 to 9O0C, e.g. from 45 to 700C, for a suitable period e.g. of 1 to 6 hours. The enzyme or enzymes are present during this extraction step, e.g. in amounts up to 5 by weight, based on oil seeds. In general, increasing the amount of enzyme increases the speed at which the oil is separated, but optimum amounts can be readily established. Once the extraction has proceeded for a desired period, the water immiscible solvent e.g. hexane, can be added, and the resultin8 mixture is filtered. The solids, thus separated comprise a protein containing fraction, and the further treatment of this fraction will be further described below. The filtrate comprises water, oil and solvent. Its pH can if desired be suitably adjusted, e.g. to 3.5 with an acid, such as citric acid, and it is then centrifuged to give an insoluble fraction, an aqueous fraction and an oil solvent fraction, the latter two fractions being separated by decantation. The desired vegetable oil is isolated by evaporating, and desirably recycling the solvent. The insolubles from the centrifuging step can be combined with the solids from the filtration step, and purified by extraction with a solvent.The residue after removal of solvent constitutes a highly advantageous protein concentrate. In an alternative and preferred embodiment, the solvent is added before or during the extraction step. The later steps of the process are otherwise the same as those of the process described above. This embodiment provides higher yields of oil. The following Examples set out results obtained when working on a laboratory scale. In theseExamples, the following enzymes were employed Enzyme C a mixture of oc amylase, glucanase and n proteinase from B. subtilis Ceremix Novo Industri A S Enzyme P a mixture of pectolytic enzymes and cellulases from A. niger Pectinex Swiss Ferment Company Enzyme G hemicellulase from A. niger Gamanase Novo Industri A S Al A. niger fungal glucanase A2 A. niger fungal hemicellulase A3 A. niger fungal pectolytic enzyme complex T Trichoderma viridii fungal cellulase EXAMPLE 1 Rapeseed was mechanically ground using a coffee mill.25g of ground meal was suspended in 100 ml of distilled water in a conical flask. 0.25 ml of enzyme C was added, and the pH was adjusted to 6.0 with M 1 NaOH. The flask and contents. were incubated in a waterbath and stirred electrically, the pH being maintained at 6.0. The following temperature programme was used 60 minutes at 500C Temperature allowed to rise to 630C by adjusting thermostat. 120 minutes at 630C Temperature allowed to rise to 800C 13 minutes at 800C On completion of this sequence, the flask and contents were cooled to room temperature. The contents of the flask were coarse filtered through a cheese cloth to remove solid debris then washed with excess hexane. The pH of the filtrate was lowered to 3.5 with M 1 citric acid and it was centrifuged to give 3 fractions 1. Oil solvent layer 2. Aqueous layer 3. Insoluble residues The top layer was decanted and the aqueous layer was separated from insolubles by filtration through paper. Insolubles were pooled, dried, ether extracted to remove any residual oil and dried. The yield of oil was calculated by determining the amount of residual oil by weight, x after evaporating the solvent from fraction 1 and expressing this value as a fraction of the total weight of raw material taken. i.e. yield 25 100 25 The amount of oil extracted average of 5 5 separate experimental runs was found to be 9.3 . The amount of extractable oil in rapeseed and soybeans was estimated by Soxhiet extraction of samples of the ground materials with hexane, followed by evaporation of the solvent from the extracted material The yields of oils were as follows Rapeseed 30.5 Soybean 19.8 These values therefore represent ideal control values the upper limits sought in the subsequent experiments .

A condenser was employed in order to prevent loss of solvent during the temperature stepped hydrolysis. The amount of oil extracted average of 5 separate experimental runs was 16.7 .

The resultant flour was weighed and homogenised to produce a slurry. This was treated with acid to lower the pH to 3.5 and diluted with after to give a 1 3.5 4 ratio of seed flour to liquid. This was then centrifuged, with the result that the extract separated into 3 layers solids at the bottom, an aqueous layer in the middle and an oily layer floating on the surface. The liquid layers were decanted and the sludge was recentrifuged to give a so3id and an oily liquid layer floating on top. Liquid layers were recentrifuged to sediment suspended solids. Solids were then combined, dried and extracted with diethyl ether and dried to give a protein concentrate fraction. Oil was collected by decantation and evaporation of solvent, and estimated by weight.
