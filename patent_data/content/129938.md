# Dental X ray examination apparatus.

## Abstract
An X ray examination apparatus, for example, for dental use, comprises an extra oral radiation entrance screen which is displaceable in a plane which is transverse with respect to a perpendicular thereto. Consequently, distortion free imaging can be performed for the entire set of teeth and the adjoining regions of the jaws.
