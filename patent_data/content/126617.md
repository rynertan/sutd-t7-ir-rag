## Description
This invention relates to a method for determining macromolecules such as proteins and kits for said determinations. The method comprises forming a stain image and developing with a specific developer solution. The detection of macromolecules such as proteins and polypeptides is extremely important in many areas of biology and clinical medicine such as genetic screening and the diagnosis of genetic diseases. In these areas, the amount of macromolecules that can be detected in cellular extracts of body fluids can determine the treatment of a patient. Electrophoresis is the movement of charged particles in a matrix under the influence of an electrical field. Electrophoresis is the primary laboratory detection and characterization technique for macromolecules see Chemical and Engineering News 3 14 83, p. 10 . Continuing developments in two dimensional gel electrophoresis have provided the capability of resolving thousands of macromolecules from complex biological mixtures. However, the inability to detect polypeptides present in low concentration has limited the application of this technology, particularly in clinical screening for pathological states, endocrinology, mammalian metabolism, developmental biology, and immunology. Because the improved gel electrophoretic techniques greatly increase macromolecule resolution, visual detection methods employing conventional polypeptide dyes are no longer adequate. The most commonly used conventional macromolecule stain is Coomassie Blue. Dyes of this type are mainly dependent upon the electrostatic attraction between dye and polypeptide, stabilized by van der Waals forces. In fact, Coomassie Blue and a variety of other dyes exhibit particular affinities for macromolecules of specific charge. Coomassie Blue, an acidic dye, stains basic macromolecules most intensely, while crystal violet is the most effective stain for acidic macromolecules. Other dyes for which quantitative aspects of staining have been investigated include Amido Black, Fast Green, and Fe² bathophenanthroline sulfonate. In contrast, the Remazol Brilliant Blue R method depends on a covalent bond between dye and polypeptide. With Coomassie Blue, the minimum amount of a protein that can be detected is approximately 0.2 to 0.5 µg. An assortment of other techniques also exist. These include densitometric scanning for absorbance at 280 nm, binding of radiolabelled or fluorescent ligands such as concanavalin A to glycoproteins, binding of antisera to polypeptides at the gel surface, and staining of specific polypeptide moieties. Radioactive detection techniques offer a higher degree of sensitivity than the stains but are often impractical to use. The above staining methods, moreover, are difficult to perform, hazardous, time consuming, and unless the macromolecules are heavily labeled, lack the sensitivity to detect proteins present in low or trace concentrations. For example, body fluids, such as cerebrospinal and amniotic fluids, are often difficult to obtain in quantity and frequently contain certain abundant proteins which cause distortion of electrophoretic patterns when sufficient sample is analyzed to observe specific trace polypeptides. Another method of visualization involves the use of silver stains. In this method, a swollen polyacrylamide electrophoretic sheet is treated with a silver salt and subsequently developed in a dilute reducing solution such as formaldehyde. An improvement in sensitization is obtained as compared with dye staining. This method entails several washing steps and many of the solutions used are unstable and must be mixed immediately before use. The silver stain method is described in PCT application publication No. WO 82 03128, September 16, 1982. The problem this invention solves is in providing a macromolecule visualization procedure that achieves a higher detection sensitivity than obtained with dye staining, and which is similar and more expedient to carry out than is the case with dye and silver staining, or autoradiography. This problem can be solved by providing a method for determining protein, nucleic acid or polypeptide macromolecules in polyacrylamide gels, said method comprising the steps of a forming a latent stain image in the gel and b developing the latent stain image by treating the gel with a developer solution characterized in that the latent stain image is formed by nucleating the macromolecules in the gel with a palladium tetramine salt and the latent stain image is developed by treating the gel with a physical developer solution comprising dimethylamine borane and a transition metal salt, a tetrazolium salt or a triazolium salt. This method is capable of detecting less than 0.01 µg of macromolecules. An electrophoregram that consists of a polyacrylamide slab is visualized by nucleation with a palladium tetramine salt and developed in a physical developer comprising a transition metal salt, tetrazolium salt or triazolium salt, dimethylamine borane and optionally an antifoggant. This method is carried out in a short time as compared to that of the dye and silver stain and autoradiographic methods. While a mixture of a silver salt and a reducing agent is extremely unstable black reduced silver begins to appear immediately after the two components are in contact , the metal or tetrazolium salt and dimethylamine borane can be mixed and left for days without any sign of reduced metal or dye. Further, sodium dodecyl sulfate SDS which can be present in the gel matrix, does not interfere with the staining procedure. This is in contrast with silver stains which require careful removal of SDS before the gel is imbibed with a silver salt solution. Kits comprising solutions of the components used in the method are also described. Use of these kits can find utility in clinical and laboratory examination of blood devices and other macromolecules separated by electrophoresis, diagnosis of metal abnormalities by examination of amniotic fluid, diagnosis of central nervous system disease by analysis of macromolecule patterns in spiral fluid and other applications in which the detection and or quantitation of macromolecules is desired. The macromolecules to be detected in this invention are proteins, nucleic acids or polypeptides. The electrophoretic separation using polyacrylamide gel slabs is carried out using any of the procedures well known in the art. After the sample believed to contain macromolecules has been introduced into the gel in a conventional manner, the macromolecules are fixed in the gel by treatment with a solution of methanol and water 1 1 for a short period of time. If a fixing agent such as acetic or trichloroacetic acid is used in the fixing step, it is removed by soaking in methanol water or ethanol water. The most preferred fixing agent solution is an aqueous mixture of ethanol and or methanol 10 50 . The above fixing agents have been employed in both histology and protein electrophoresis for years. Generally, the gels are fixed by immersion in the fixing agent solution for a period of about 30 60 minutes. The first steps in this method are generalized preparation of the protein solution, preparation of the gel slabs and loading and running the gels. This process, prior to visualization, is known in the art as the Laemmli System U.K. Laemmli, Nature, 227, 680 685 1970 . Macromolecule solutions are prepared by mixing the macromolecule solution which can contain salts, with an equal volume of a treatment solution consisting of a buffer such as tris hydrogen methyl aminomethane hydrochloride TRIS HCl , sodium dodecyl sulfate, glycerol and 2 mercaptoethanol. The mixture is placed in a test tube and immersed into a boiling water bath for 1.5 3 minutes and then chilled in ice. Generally, 1 microliter of this solution contains 0.5 µg of protein. The protein solution is divided into 1 mL lots and stored at 20 C. The gel slabs are prepared using the Laemmli system described above. This system involves 2 gel layers. The layer in which the proteins are separated is referenced to as the running layer separating layer and the layer in which the protein solutions are applied is referenced to as the stacking layer. The stacking layer is discarded prior to the visualization step. The stacking layer allows the protein solution to be concentrated at the top of the separating gel in a narrow band to obtain sharper bands. The gel slabs can be made using the following Stock Solutions The separating gel is prepared using a Hoefer Scientific Instruments SE600 Vertical Slab Gel Unit. Different thicknesses 0.75, 1.5 mm of gel are obtained by the use of plastic spacers. The separating gel solution without the initiator and TEMED is degassed for approximately 5 10 minutes using a water aspirator. The initiator and TEMED are then added and the solution poured between glass plates 14 x 16 cm using a disposable Pasteur pipet to a level 4 cm from the top of the plates. A water layer is then applied above the solution by means of a glass syringe. The solution polymerizes within 15 minutes after which the water layer is discarded and the gel is covered with a few mL of the Running Gel Overlay solution and left overnight. The stacking gel is prepared as follows The next day, the gel is rinsed and the stacking gel solution minus the Initiator and TEMED is degassed, after which the polymerization catalysts are added, and the mixture poured over the gel. A plastic comb is inserted in order to mold the sample wells in the gel and the gel is allowed to polymerize for approximately 1 hour. After this time, the comb is removed, the wells formed by the comb are rinsed with water and are then ready for loading. Loading and running the gels is accomplished as follows Each well is filled with Tank Buffer and the protein sample is underlayered into each well by means of a 10 µL glass syringe. The glass sandwiches are then placed into the electrophoresis tank which is filled with tank buffer. The upper chamber is filled with this same buffer and the separation is carried out at a current level of 15 30 ma per gel. The voltage varies during a run from an initial value of 85 V to 330 V at the end of the separation for 2 gels . A tracking dye, bromophenol blue or phenol red, is added to one of the slots at the start. During the separation, the dye migrates with greater velocity than any of the protein fractions. The run is terminated when the dye is within 1 3 cm of the bottom of the glass sandwich. The visualization steps include the following The plates are separated, the stacking gel discarded, and the separating gel slab placed into a 300 ml methanol water 1 1 mixture for washing on a rocking table. After washing for 1 hour, the gels are ready for visualization. For The first step in the visualization method of the present invention comprises treating the fixed electrophotogram with a catalytic metal precursor to form a latent stain image. The catalyst used is a palladium tetramine salt such as palladium tetramine chloride or palladium tetramine nitrate. These particular catalysts unexpectedly yield excellent results in that they possess the proper combination of stability and solubility to sensitize the electrophoregram from the macromolecular area. Similar catalysts such as palladium bis ethylene diamine chloride or potassium palladium tetrathiocyanate yield a much lower degree of nucleation sensitivity , and potassium palladium tetrachloride is too easily reduced to catalytic palladium to give proper image differentiation. In some instances, the SDS presensitizers and the palladium tetramine salt can be combined in one solution. The catalyst is generally present in coverages of from 0.009 to 1.9 mg m². The development of the latent stain image is accomplished by treating the gel with a developer solution comprising dimethylamine borane as the reducing agent. Other reducing agents result in high fog because they do not adequately differentiate between the image protein area and the background. The developing solution also comprises a transition metal salt, tetrazolium salt or triazolium salt physical developer. The tetrazolium salt can be present in the amounts between 1 mg 0.093 m² and 100 mg 0.093 m² and the reducing agent can be present in amounts between 1 mg 0.093 m² and 200 mg 0.093 m². An extremely wide variety of tetrazolium salts may be used as reducible dye precursors in the practice of the present invention. It is understood that the term tetrazolium salt throughout the application includes tetrazolium salts, ditetrazolium salts and tetrazolium betaines. Useful tetrazolium salts are described in The Chemistry of Formazans and Tetrazolium Salts , A. W. Nineham, Tetrazolium salts useful in the present invention include compounds having the general formula wherein Ar¹, Ar² and Ar³ may be the same or different and represent phenyl groups or phenyl groups substituted with electron withdrawing groups such as nitro, methoxy and the like or electron donating groups such as alkyl and Ar³ can also represent a 4,5 dialkyl 2 thiazolyl group containing 1 to 5 carbon atoms in the alkyl group or a 2 benzthiazolyl group and X is an anion such as a halide, acetate or tetra fluoroborate. Specific examples of tetrazolium salts and methods for their preparation can be found in Canadian Patent No. 860,873. Triazolium salts may also be employed as reducible dye precursors in the practice of this invention. These are colorless compounds that are reduced by the process of the invention to colored azo amine dyes. Exemplary triazolium salts are disclosed in Physical developer baths can be made from substantially equal volumes of a solution of a tetrazolium salt and a solution of a reducing agent. The resulting physical developer bath is considered useful if the tetrazolium salt is not spontaneously reduced to formazan dye but is reduced to formazan dye when palladium 0 or other catalyst is added to the bath. By spontaneously, it is meant that the formazan dye is formed essentially instantaneously without the metal nuclei. The physical developers useful in the present invention can be simple solvent solutions of the tetrazolium salt and the reducing agent. The solvent is one in which the tetrazolium salt is soluble and the corresponding formazan dye as well as the palladium nuclei is insoluble. Mixtures of solvents may also be used to advantage. For example, the solubility of a tetrazolium salt in aqueous solution may be enhanced by the addition of methanol. Other useful solvents besides water include methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, and acetonitrile. The solution can be saturated with the tetrazolium salt but is useful with as little as about 0.1 tetrazolium salt by weight of the solvent. The transition metal salt deposited from the bath must itself be autocatalytic that is, it must act as a catalyst for further deposition of metal from the developer. This is necessary in order that deposition and development will continue after palladium nuclei are enveloped with heavy metal. With respect to the Periodic Table, suitable heavy metals can be selected from Group VIII metals such as nickel, cobalt, iron, palladium and platinum, Group VIB metals such as chromium and Group IB metals such as copper, silver and gold. Almost any heavy metal salt which is a source of the desired heavy metal ions can be employed. Suitable heavy metal salts useful in the invention include heavy metal halides such as cobaltous bromide, cobaltous chloride, cobaltous iodide, ferrous bromide, ferrous chloride, chromium bromide, chromium chloride, chromium iodide, copper chloride, silver bromide, silver chloride, silver iodide, gold chloride, palladium chloride and platinum chloride, heavy metal sulfates such as nickel sulfate, ferrous sulfate, cobaltous sulfate, chromium sulfate, copper sulfate, palladium sulfate and platinum sulfate, heavy metal nitrates such as nickel nitrate, ferrous nitrate, cobaltous nitrate, chromium nitrate and copper nitrate, and heavy metal salts of organic acids such as ferrous acetate, cobaltous acetate, chromium acetate and copper formate. Baths can be formulated based on a single heavy metal or based on mixtures of heavy metals. The developer solution also preferably contains an antifogging agent to reduce the effects of fogging. It has been found that ethyl cysteine HCl, or dimethyl cysteine dihydrochloride in combination with the dimethylamine borane yields excellent discrimination between image and background. Other antifoggants such as dimethylaminoethanethiol HCl are also useful herein. In the preferred embodiments of this invention, the physical development bath contains from 0.1 to 10 of the dimethylamine borane, from 0.1 to 10 of the transition metal salt tetrazolium salt or triazolium salt and from 0.01 to 1 of the antifoggant. The physical developer solution can contain additional materials such as complexing agents such as gluconic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid and ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid. It has been found that the use of gluconic acid produces superior results in sensitivity, stability and fog levels. In addition, it is desirable to include SDS sensitizers in the physical developer solution. Thus, amounts of 0.1 to 1 of SDS in the developer solution results in greater sensitivity without excessive fogging. The development is generally carried out in 10 to 20 minutes. Kits comprising the solution of palladium tetramine chloride and the physical developer solution are useful in treating the gel slabs. In this respect, it is preferred that the tetramine borane and the palladium complex be in different solutions in the visualization method. The following examples are presented to illustrate more fully the invention. A developer was prepared as follows A sensitizer Pd NH₃ ₄Cl₂ was prepared as follows 3.6 g of PdCl₂ was mixed with 350 ml of deionized water and 50 ml of concentrated ammonium hydroxide. After stirring overnight, all of the pdCl₂ had dissolved. This solution was placed under aspirator vacuum for 8 hours and diluted to 500 ml with water to give a 1 solution of Pd NH₃ ₄Cl₂ whose final pH was 8.7. Samples of β Galactosidase at levels of 1, 0.1, and 0.01 µg lane 0.75 mm polyacrylamide slabs were fixed in CH₃OH H₂O 1 1 for at least one hour, and then developed as follows The results were compared with those obtained by dye visualization. β Galactosidase has two major electrophoretic bands. The minimum amount at 1 cm wide bands at which these bands can be observed using the dye stain visualization method Stock Solutions 8, 9 and 10 where the procedure consisted of was approximately 1 µg. The minimum protein concentration that could be detected with the nickel development procedure was below 0.1 µg. A developer was prepared as described in Example 1 but with the addition of 10 µl of a 1 methanol water 1 1 solution of 1 phenyl 2 tetrazoline 5 thione commonly known as phenylmercaptotetrazole PMT . Samples of β Galactosidase in polyacrylamide gel as described in Example 1 were developed as described in the four step sequence in Example 1. The minimum protein concentration that could be detected with this developer was less than 0.1 µg. The addition of the PMT caused a significant reduction in background fog. In addition, used developer solution was stable for an indefinite period of time. A developer was prepared as in Example 2 but with the addition of sodium dodecyl sulfate SDS to give a SDS concentration in the developer of 0.44 . Samples of β Galactosidase were nucleated as described in Example 1 and developed in the SDS containing developer. The fog was lower than that obtained in Example 2 where an antifoggant was used without the SDS addition, and the minimum protein concentration detected was less than 0.1 µg. The following nucleating agents were used in place of the nucleating agent described in Example 1 Pd NH₃ ₄Cl₂ with the same developer as described in Example 1. All were tested at the 0.1 level. The results for β Galactosidase showed that minimum protein concentration of 1 to 0.1 µg could be detected but that much longer development times were required as compared with Pd NH₃ ₄Cl₂. A developer was formulated as described in Example 1 but with the substitution of tartaric acid for gluconic acid. The results for β Galactosidase were the same as obtained in Example 1. A sample of human serum albumin was prepared following the procedure used for β Galactosidase. A separation was carried out as described above for loading and running the gels and the electrophoregram developed using the composition described in Example 1. The minimum protein concentration that could be detected was less than 0.1 µg. Similar results were obtained with catalase. A separating gel was prepared using the formulation described above in preparing gel slabs wherein the final acrylamide monomer concentration was 20 . A separation was carried out on human serum albumin and the slabs developed as described in Example 1. The results were the same as those described for slabs in which the polyacrylamide concentration was 10 Example 5 . Electrophoretic separation of human serum albumin was carried out as described in Example 6 wherein the slab thickness was 1.5 mm instead of 0.75 mm . The development procedure described in Example 1 was carried out and the results as compared with Example 6 were identical. Samples of β Galactosidase in polyacrylamide electrophoregrams 0.75 mm thick containing 10 acrylamide and 2.7 methylene bisacrylamide were nucleated as follows This procedure caused the polyacrylamide slab to appear turbid. However, examination by transmitted light revealed the majority of the protein bands in the various lanes quite clearly. These appear as less turbid areas in contrast to the cloudy background. A sample similar to that described in Example 9 was stored for two weeks in a solution of methanol water 1 1 that also contained 10 v v of acetic acid. This sample developed poorly low density after the sensitization and development procedures described in Example 9. However, soaking the electrophoregram in methanol water 1 1 for 5 hours before sensitizing and developing gave a satisfactory visualization. The minimum protein concentration that could be detected was 0.01 µg. An electrophoregram of β Galactosidase 2.5 µg had been dye stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and stored in methanol water 1 1 . The sample was later removed from the storage solution and given the following sensitization and development procedure After the development step, the sample showed a good visualization pattern that was much more dense than that of the dye stain, and several minor bands appeared that heretofore were not visible. A sample of isoenzymes lactate dehydrogenase isotrol, Sigma Chemical Co. which has 5 human lactate dehydrogenase isoenzymes was run in the standard 10 polyacrylamide gel and run at concentrations of 100 , diluted 10 times and diluted 100 times. The dilutions were carried out with the tank buffer solution described above. A sample was given the following nucleation and development procedure The number of bands shown after 30 minutes development were compared with those that are visualized with the Coomassie Brilliant Blue Staining Procedure for 0.01x concentration . Thus, the increase in sensitivity achieved by Nickel Development is at least 100 fold. A developer was formulated as follows Electrophoregrams of β Galactosidase as described in Example 1 were nucleated with 0.15 Pd NH₃ ₄Cl₂ for 1 minute, rinsed briefly with deionized water, and developed in the dye forming physical developer for 10 minutes. The protein bands appeared as red images against a pink background. The minimum protein concentration detectable was 0.1 µg. A developing solution was prepared as in Example 1, but with the addition of 10 µL of a 1 solution of ethyl cysteine HCl. An electrophoregram of β Galactosidase in polyacrylamide gel was sensitized as described in Example 9 and developed in the solution for 20 minutes at 25 C. After this time, the main protein band could be observed at protein concentrations as low as 1 µg. The fog level as measured with a transmittance densitometer was less than 0.7. Substituting dimethylaminoethanethiol HCl or dimethyl cysteine dihydrochloride Aldrich for the ethyl cysteine gave similar results. An electrophoregram of human serum albumin was nucleated by the procedure described in Example 9, except that the Pd solution was lowered to 0.01 . The immersion time in this sensitizing solution was increased from 1 minute to 10 minutes. Development in the developer described in Example 14 gave the same sensitivity as was found at the higher Pd concentrations 0.1 and shorter immersion times. However, the background in the dilute case was higher 2.4 as compared with 1.0 for the short immersion time example. A sample of human serum albumin was dissolved in the following solution to give a concentration of The above was dissolved in 1 liter of water and the final pH adjusted to 8.3 with NaOH. This solution was used as the buffer in the electrophoresis procedure. A non SDS polyacrylamide gradient gel sold by Separation Sciences was used. This gel contains the solution described above. The albumin solution was placed in wells cut into the gel and electrophoresed for 5 hours at a constant voltage of 200 V. The gel was then removed and fixed in methanol and water 1 1 for 1 hour. The gel was nucleated and developed as described in Examples 3 and 9. After 20 minute development, protein bands at the 100 ng level could easily be detected. A control stained with Coomassie Blue gave only a faint image at the 1000 ng level.
