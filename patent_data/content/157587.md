# Oil well pipe joint.

## Abstract
An oil well pipe joint comprising a metal to metal sealing portion without thread is disclosed. A metal plated or resin coated layer exhibiting improved resistance to galling is pro vided on the outer peripheral surface of a thread free lip portion which constitutes part of the metal to metal sealing portion on an externally threaded member. At the metal sealing portion, satisfactory sealing properties are maintained under severe corrosive conditions, enabling the joint to be connected and disconnected over 10 times, and usually over 25 times.
