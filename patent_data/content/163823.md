## Description
PERFECTED SCREW ON STUD FOR SPORTS SHOESThe present invention relates to a perfected screw on stud for sports shoes, particularly football boots.Sports shoes are known to be fitted with screw on studs selected according to the condition of the terrain on which they are to be employed. Such known types of studs comprise a truncated cone body, the latter forming the body of the stud itself and having its small end shaped in such a manner as to rest on the ground, a threaded in sert driven into the said truncated cone body and project ing from the large end of the same, and a cup washer inserted between the truncated cone body and the surface of the sole on the shoe, prior to screwing the said truncatedcone body, by means of the said threaded insert, into a re cess formed in the said sole. Studs of the aforementioned type present a number of drawbacks.Firstly, as the said threaded insert is simply driven in projecting manner into the said truncated cone body, the latter resting directly on the ground, the stud may easily be worked off the shoe, owing to the said threaded insert, the driven part of which is simply knurled, working its way out of the said truncated cone body follaaring prolonged use of the stud. Furtherwtore, the employment of an essentially free fitting washer, connected to no other component parts on the stud and inserted each time, prior to fitting on the stud, between the truneated cone body and the sole on the shoe, may cause problems for the wearer, i.e. it may be assembled wrongly in such a position as to cause discomfort to the wearer, or it may, quite simply, be lost. In addition to these drawbacks, the said washer may even be worked out of place after assembly or, when screwing on the stud, it may be turned together with the truncatedcone body, thus ruining the sole on the shoe.The aim of the present invention is to provide a screw on stud of the aforementioned type involving none of the aforementioned drawbacks, i.e. one providing for easy, cheap manufacture and reliable use, and for ensuring against withdrawal of the stud and,tor loss or displacerent of the washer.with thfs aim in viev, the present invention relates to a screw on stud for sports shoes, the said stud comprising a truncated cone body, a threaded member secured integral with the said truncated cone body and designed to screw into a recess formed in the sole on the said shoe, and a cup washer mounted essentially coaxial vith the said threaded member between the large end of the said truncated cone body and the bearing surface of the said sole, the said stud being characterised by the fact that the said threaded member consists of a screw fitted through and secured angularly integral with the said truncated cone body, and that it comprises means for securing the said washer in idle manner on to the said truncated cone body the said screw comprising a thread ed shank, projecting from the large end of the said trun cated cone body, and a head resting on the small end of the said truncated cone body and shaped so as to form the bearing part of the said stud resting on the ground.Two non limiting arrangements of the present invention will now be described with reference to the attached draw ings in which Fig.1 shows a section of a stud according to the present invention, fitted inside a recess on a shoe shown only in part for simplicity Fig.2 shows a longitudinal section of a variation to the Fig.1 stud.Number 1 in Fig.1 indicates a sports shoe, in particular, a football boot or other field sport shoe, only the front part of which is shown by the dotted line for simplicity.Number 2 in Fig.1 shows a screw on stud for shoe 1, the said stud 2 being shown out of scale in relation to shoe 1, for the sake of clarity. The said stud 2 comprises a truncated cone body 3, made of metal such as aluminium or synthetic plastic resin such as nylon a washer 4, pre ferably cup type, inserted between the large end 5 of body 3 and the bearing surface of sole 6 on shoe 1 and a threaded member for securing body 3 and washer 4 to sole 6 and designed to screw into a respective recess 7 consisting, for exule, of a metal boss driven into sole 6 on shoe 1.According to the present invention, the said threaded member consists of a screw 8 fitted right through truncated cone body 3 and secured axially and angularly in tegral with the same by means of a threaded shank 9 comprising, on the small end side 10 of body 3, a knurled por tion Ii designed to engage with the inner surface of a through hole 12 in body 3 inside which the said shank 9 is housed. The latter projects axially from the large end 5 of body 3 by a given length enabling it to be screwed into recess 7. Screw 8 also comprises a head 13 formed in one piece with shank 9 and resting, when screw 8 is fitted inside body 3, on the small end 10 of the latter.The said head 13 is formed in such a manner as to cover the whole of small end o, to define an extension of body 3 and es sentially to act as the bearing part of stud 2 resting on the ground. According to the present invention, stud 2 al so comprises means for securing washer 4 in idle manner on to truncated cone body 3, the said means comprising an annular ridge 14 formed in one piece with the large end 5 of truncated cone body 3 and projecting from the surface of the said large end 5 by a given length greater than the thickness of washer 4.According to the present invention, the said washer 4 is provided with a centre hole 15 design ed to engage in idle manner with ridge 14 on which washer 4 is mounted coaxial with body 3 and shank 9 on screw 8.For securing washer 4 on to ridge 14, the latter is also provided on its free end with shoulder means designed to engage with the inner face of washer 4 for preventing axial movement of the same and consisting, according to the non limiting example shorn, of an elastically deformed e.g. clinched end 16 on ridge 14 permanently set after fitting screw 8 inside body 3 and washer 4 on to ridge 14. According to the present invention, washer 4 also comprises an essentially flat bottom wall 18, engaging with large end 5, and a slanting annular side wall 19, essentially truncated cone shaped and blending widely with wall 18 with which, according to the present invention, it forms an angle of essentially 130 1320.Finally, washer 4 presents an annular truncated cone edge 20 having a different angle from slanting side wall 19 and form ed in such a manner as to blend with the surface of sole 6.Operation of stud 2 according to the present invention will be clear from the foregoing description. After fitting screw 8 inside body 3 and washer 4 on to annular ridge 14 on the said body 3, end 16 on the said ridge 14 is set so as to lock washer 4 on to body 3. Engaging in idle manner with ridge 14, the said washer 4 is thus allow ed to turn in relation to body 3 so that, when stud 2 is screwed into recess 7, washer 4 is unaffected by the torque on shank 9 produced by turning body 3 manually, e.g. using a wrench, thus leaving the sole of shoe 1 undamaged. Similarly, any strain transmitted between the ground and shoe 1 via stud 2 has no effect on washer 4, which thus undergoes no displacement and ensures not only long working life of sole 6 but also maximum comfort for the wearer of shoe 1 fitted with studs according to the present invention. As washer 4 is prevented from working its way out of support 14, it obviously cannot be lost.Furthermore, the fact that washer 4 need no longer be re peatedly inserted correctly by hand between body 3 and sole 6 provides for fast, easy assembly and removal of stud 2. Washer 4, in fact, is already assembled in the ideal position and forms, together with body 3 and screw 8, a one piece stud 2 which may be assembled or removed in one single operation. Finally, stud 2 according to the present invention is prevented from working its way out of sole 6 in that, once stud 2 is screwed into recess 7, body 3 is locked entirely between washer 4, resting on sole 6, and head 73 on screw 8 resting on the ground.Hence, replacing the traditional threaded insert with screw 8 according to the present invention prevents any possibility of body 3 working loose, whereas head 13 pro triodes for improved transmission and distribution of mechanical strain exerted on stud 2 itself. All the aforementioned results and advantages are also and especially provided for by the special design of washer 4 and, in particular, by the angle provided for between walls 18 and 19 on the same, the said angle being determined by years of experimental research conducted by the presentApplicant,Number 22 in Fig.2 shows a variation of the Fig.1 stud, in which, for the sake of simplicity, similar or identical parts to those already described are indicated by the same numbers.Stud 22, of which only body 3 and washer 4 are shown for simplicity, is practically identical vith stud 2, the only difference being the design of body 3 which is designed to enable it to be formed exclusively from synthetic plastic resin, instead of metal. Consequent ly, screw 8 omitted for simplicity in Fig.2 may be in serted into hole 12 on plastic body 3 subsequent to formation of the latter, as in the case of stud 2, or preferably, it may be inserted inside body 3 during molding of the latter, so as to be embedded inside truncated cone body 3 on finished stud 22. Like body 3 on the Fig.1 stud 2, the truncated cone body 3 on stud 22 is provided with an annular ridge 14 on its large end 5, the said ridge 14 being engaged in idle manner by washer 4 identical with the one on stud 2.To secure washer 4 on to annular ridge 14 and so prevent axial withdrawal, ridge 14 is provided with a number preferably three of elastically deformable teeth 25 formed in one piece with the free end of ridge 14 when molding body 3 and designed to flex in the direction of the axis of hole 12, so as to enable washer 4 to be clicked on to ridge 14, and subsequently to lock the said washer 4 on the said ridge 14. Teeth 25 are preferably serrated, each having a flared surface 26 with its tapered end facing the opposite way to small end 10, so as to enable washer 4 to be clicked easily on to ridge 14 and, once inserted, prevent washer 4 from being withdrawn, unless teeth 25 are broken. Thus, stud 22 also forms one piece which may be assembled or removed in one single operation. The advantages and operation of stud 22 are the same as already described in connection with stud 2. The advantages of the stud according to the present inven tion and of the sports shoes s fitted with the same will be clear from the foregoing description. To those skilled in the art it will be clear that changes may be made to the invention described herein without, however, departing from the scope of the same.
