## Description
The present invention relates to a curable polymer composition comprising an organic polymer having at least one silicon containing reactive group in a molecule, which composition is readily cured. An organic polymer having at least one silicon containing reactive group is known in the field. This polymer is similar to moisture curable polysiloxane in that it cures by forming siloxane linkage, but is different in that it contains an organic polymer in the backbone chain. One example of such polymer is a polymer of the formula The organic polymer having at least one silicon containing reactive group can be used as a pressure sensitive adhesive and a sealant cf. U.S. Patent Nos. 4,463,115 and 3,971,751 . Usually, a curing catalyst is used for curing the organic polymer having at least one silicon containing reactive group. As the curing catalyst, there are known various compounds such as titanate esters e.g. tetra n butoxytitanate , tin carboxylate compounds e.g. dibutyltin dilaurate and tin dioctylate and amines. Although these catalysts are selected and used according to the final use and application of the curable composition, generally they have low catalytic activity and only provide a low curing rate. Therefore, a highly active curing catalyst which can cure the composition at a high rate is desired. In the case where the polymer is used as the pressure sensitive adhesive, the polymer is required to cure in a very short period of time, i.e., within one minute, for effective production of the adhesive. Among the curing catalysts described above, titanate esters and a combination of tin carboxylate and amine have fairly high curing activity. However, the pressure sensitive adhesive containing titanate ester has drawbacks such as discoloring of the adhesive. The pressure sensitive adhesive containing tin carboxylate and amine has drawbacks such as discoloring and odor due to amine, and bleeding of amine on the surface of the pressure sensitive adhesive which results in change of adhesive properties. In the case where the polymer is used as the sealant, the curing catalyst having high activity is required for shorter term of works. The sealant composition containing tin carboxylate and amine has high curing rate, but has low adhesivity to a substrate which is one of the important properties of the sealant. Moreover, the sealant composition containing tin carboxylate has such a drawback that the activity of the catalyst is decreased after the storage of the composition. An object of the present invention is to provide a curable polymer composition comprising an organic polymer having at least one silicon containing group in a molecule and a curing catalyst which can cure the polymer at a high curing rate. Another object of the present invention is to provide a curable polymer composition having a high curing rate which is suitable for a pressure sensitive adhesive. Further object of the present invention is to provide a curable polymer composition having a high curing rate even after long term storage. Still another object of the present invention is to provide a curable polymer composition having a high curing rate and high adhesivity to a substrate. Accordingly, the present invention relates to a curable polymer composition comprising The silicon containing reactive group I can initiate a condensation reaction in the presence of a catalyst and optionally in the presence of water or moisture or a cross linking agent.

Among them, the organic polymer A comprises at least 50 by weight of acrylate or methacrylate hereinafter referred to as meth acrylate is preferred. Preferred meth acrylate is ester of meth acrylic acid with a straight or branched C₂ C₁₂ alkyl or cycloalkyl alcohol. Specific examples of meth acrylate are n butyl meth acrylate, 2 ethylhexyl meth acrylate, ethyl meth acrylate, propyl meth acrylate, isobutyl meth acrylate, amyl meth acrylate, hexyl meth acrylate, cyclohexyl meth acrylate, n octyl meth acrylate and n decyl meth acrylate. The vinyl type polymer has a molecular weight of 500 to 1,000,000, preferably 2,000 to 500,000. Particularly, one having a molecular weight of 3,000 to 15,000 is preferred when the silicon containing group is present as a terminal group. The organic polymer A may be used alone or as a mixture with at least one other organic polymer A . For example, a mixture of the alkyleneoxide polymer and the vinyl type polymer such as polyalkyl acrylate can be used.

Moreover, the curing catalyst used according to the present invention does not discolor the cured polymer. The composition of the invention finds various application including a pressure sensitive adhesive composition and a sealing material. When the composition of the invention is used as the pressure sensitive adhesive, it is applied on a tape, sheet, label or foil. Namely, the composition in the form of a non solvent type liquid, a solution, an emulsion or a hot melt type may be applied on a substrate such as a film of a synthetic or modified natural resin, paper, fabrics, metal foil, metallized plastic foil, asbestos or glass fiber fabrics and cured at a room temperature or an elevated temperature with optional exposure to water or moisture. To regulate the adhesion characteristics of the composition, a tackifier resin may be added to the composition. Specific examples of the tackifier resin are resins having a polar group such as rosin ester resin, phenol resin, xylene resin, xylene phenol resin, terpene phenol resin petroleum resins with relatively small polarity such as aromatic polymer, aliphatic aromatic copolymer and alicyclic polymer cumaron resin low molecular weight polystyrene terpene resin. Commercially available tackifier resins are as follows Resins with comparatively small polarity Petrosin 80 , Tackaoe A 100 and FTR 6100 Mitsui Petrochemical Industries Co., Ltd., Japan , Neopolymer S Nippon Petrochemical Co., Ltd., Japan , Quinton 1500 Nippon Zeon Co., Ltd. Japan , Picolasteck A 75 Hercules Inc. , and Cumaron G 90 Nittetsu Chemical Co., Ltd., Japan . Resins having a polar group YS polystar T 115 and S 145 Yasuhara Oil and Fat Co., Ltd., Japan , Steberite ester 7 Hercules Inc. , and Neopolymer E 100 Nippon Petrochemical Co., Ltd., Japan . When the composition of the invention is used as the sealing material, optionally added is a plasticizer, a filler, a reinforcement, an antisagging agent, a colorant, an anti aging agent, an adhesion promoting agent, a property modifier. Specific examples of the plasticizer are phthalates e.g. dibutyl phthalate, diheptyl phthalate, di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate, butyl benzyl phthalate, butyl phthalyl glycolate non aromatic dibasic acid esters e.g. dioctyl adipate, dioctyl sebacate , esters of polyalkylene glycol e.g. diethylene glycol dibenzoate, triethylene glycol dibenzoate, phosphates e.g. tricresyl phosphate, tributyl phosphate, chlorinated paraffines hydrocarbon oils e.g. alkyldiphenyl, partially hydrogenated terphenyl, which are used alone or as a mixture thereof. The plasticizer may be added in the course of the polymerization. Specific examples of the filler or reinforcement are heavy or light calcium carbonate, calcium carbonate having a surface treated with an aliphatic acid, a resin acid, a cationic surfactant, anionic surfactant and the like, magnesium carbonate, talc, titanium oxide, barium sulfate, alumina, metal powder e.g. aluminum, zinc and iron powder , bentonite, kaolin clay, fumed silica, silica powder, and carbon black. When a transparent filler or reinforcement such as fumed silica is used, a transparent sealing material is prepared. Specific examples of the antisagging agent are hydrogenated castor oil, and metal soap such as calcium stearate, aluminum stearate and barium stearate. The anti sagging agent may not be used depending on the end use and or the presence of the filler or reinforcement. As the colorant, conventional organic or inorganic pigment or dye may be used. Specific examples of the property modifier are silane coupling agents such as alkylalkoxy silanes e.g. methyltrimethoxysilane, dimethyldimethoxysilane, trimethylmethoxysilane, n propyltrimethoxysilane, alkylisopropenoxysilanes e.g. dimethyldiisopropenoxysilane, methyltriisopropenoxysilane, γ glycidoxypropylmethyldiisopropenoxysilane, alkoxysilane having a functional group e.g. γ glycidoxypropylmethyldimethoxysilane, γ glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane, vinyltrimethoxysilane, vinyldimethylmethoxysilane, γ aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, N β aminoethyl aminopropylmethyldimethoxysilane, γ mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane, γ mercaptopropylmethyldimethoxysilane, silicone varnish polysiloxanes, etc. Addition of the property modifier can increase or decrease the hardness of the cured composition. The adhesivity promoting agent is not necessarily added to the composition of the invention, since the polymer used according to the present invention itself has enough adhesivity to be applied on the surface of the various substrates such as glass, ceramics, metal, or the polymer can be adhered to various surfaces by the use of a primer. Specific examples of the adhesivity promoting agent are epoxy resins, phenol resins, silane coupling agents, alkyl titanate, aromatic polyisocyanate, and mixtures thereof. The sealing material comprising the polymer composition of the invention may be formulated as a moisture curing one pack type one by compounding all the components and stored in a sealed state. Alternatively, the sealing material may be formulated as a two pack type one consisting of the polymer composition and a curing mixture containing the curing catalyst, the filler, the plasticizer, water and other suitable component s except the polymer, which are mixed in use. In case of the one pack type sealing material, since all the components are compounded beforehand, preferably, any component including water or moisture should be dehydrated before compounding, or the components are compounded with removing water or moisture, for example, under reduced pressure. In case of the two pack type one, since the polymer composition does not contain any curing catalyst, either the polymer composition and the curing mixture may contain a slight amount of water or moisture. However, for longer storage of the sealing material, it is advisable to dehyd rate it. Solid components such as powder may be heated to dehydrate, and liquid components may be dehydrated under reduced pressure or with a desiccant such as synthetic zeolites, active alumina and silica gel. Alternatively or in addition, water or moisture can be removed by adding a small amount of isocyanate compound to react the isocyanate group with water or moisture. Furthermore, storage stability of the sealing material is improved by the addition of lower alcohol e.g. methanol, ethanol, or alkoxysilanes e.g. n propyltrimethoxysilane, vinylmethyldimethoxylsilane, γ mercaptopropylmethyldimethoxysilane, γ glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane, . To improve processability of the polymer composition and or to reduce the viscosity of the composition, a solvent may be used. Specific examples of the solvent are aromatic hydrocarbons e.g. toluene, xylene, , esters e.g. ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, amyl acetate, cellosolve acetate, , and ketones e.g. methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, diisobutyl ketone, . In addition to the pressure sensitive adhesive and the sealing material, the polymer composition of the invention may be used as an adhesive, a templating agent, an insulating material, a foaming material, a spraying material.
