# Magnetic read write apparatus.

## Abstract
A magnetic head has a pair of outer pole pieces 32,34 spaced from a central pole piece 36 to define a pair of transducing gaps 28, 30 . An individual coil 12, 14 is disposed between each of the outer pole pieces and the central pole piece. The coils 12, 14 are connected to control circuit means Figure 8 which is operable to connect the coils in series for a write operation so that the flux in the outer pole pieces is additive for writing , and to connect the coils in series opposition for a read operation so that the flux produced in the central pole by a previously recorded magnetic transition in the magnetic recording medium adjacent to the transducing gaps is sensed additively in the coils .
