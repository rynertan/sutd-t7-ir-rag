# Antistatic coating compositions and elements.

## Abstract
An antistatic coating composition useful in forming con ductive layers comprises a conductive, waterdispersible, par ticulate polymer and a crosslinkable latex binder. The cross linkable latex has a first glass transition temperature before crosslinking less than 50 C and a second glass transition tem perature after crosslinking an coalescing greater then 50 C wherein the first and second glass transition temperatures differ by at least 4 C. The coating composition can be coated on a variety of supports to produce conductive elements. The coating compositions are particularly useful in forming pho tographic elements which are resistant to the buildup of static charge and ferrotyping.
