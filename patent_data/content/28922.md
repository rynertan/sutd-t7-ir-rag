# IMPROVED INEXPENSIVE ELECTRODE FOR METAL AIR CELLS AND METHOD OF MAKING SAME

## Abstract
The electrode is self supporting, inexpensive and is of the throwaway or non rechargeable type utilizable in metal air cells and batteries. It comprises a readily corrodible, inexpensive current collector, preferably of iron or steel or copper, and an electrochemically active layer. The current collector has a hydrophobic coating, preferably of polytetraf luoroethylene or the like, to at least partially protect it from corrosion. The electrochemically active layer is secured to the current collector through the hydrophobic coating so as to form therewith a self supporting electrode. This layer comprises particulate carbon catalyst with a hydrophobic binder compatible with the hydrophobic coating on the collector and fused thereto and present in an amount sufficient to bind the carbon particles into a coherent layer. The binder aids the coating in protecting the collector. The use of expensive, separately generated, thin hydrophobic films placed into the structure during its formation is totally obviated so that a lower cost is achieved while still providing an electrode having suitable electrochemical activity.
