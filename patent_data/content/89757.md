# Bellows sealed rotary valve.

## Abstract
A valve body 12 includes a passageway 18 for the flow of fluid therethrough, a valve member 26 , such as a ball valve member, is positioned in the passageway 18 for rotatable movement about a first rotational axis 38 between an open position and a closed position to open and close the passageway 18 . An actuator 30 orbits about the first axis 38 to move the valve member 26 between the open and closed positions. A bent unitary valve stem 28 extends between the valve member 26 and the actuator 30 . A lower end 40 of the unitary valve stem 28 is aligned with the first axis 38 and is connected to the valve member 26 for rotation with the valve member 26 . An upper end of the unitary valve stem 28 is aligned with a second axis 44 angularly displaced from the first axis 38 . A bearing assembly 46 retained in the actuator 30 connects the stem upper end 42 to the actuator 30 . A bellows 50 , bent to follow the curvature of the valve stem 28 , surrounds the valve stem 28 to form a primary pressure boundary hermetically sealing the valve stem 28 . A housing 82 surround the bellow 50 forming a secondary pressure boundary with the handle 68 of the actuator 30 and accompanying static and dynamic O ring seals. A lower end of the bellow 50 is connected to the valve body 12 . An upper end of the bellow 50 is connected to the bearing assembly 46 which rotatably supports the bellow 50 in the actuator 30 . The actuator 30 orbits about the first axis 38 to open and close the valve while the upper end of the bellows 50 rotates about the second axis 44 . Turning the actuator 30 transmits torque through the pressure bound aries without applying torque to the bellows 50 .
