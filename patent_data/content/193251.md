## Description
This invention relates to field effect transistor FET transducer devices. The invention relates particularly to encapsulated microelectronic arrays of individual, selective, chemical sensitive FET transducers for use in the separate or simultaneous detection and or measurement of various chemical properties. Chemical properties , as used herein, shall be understood to include ion activity and concentration, presence and concentration of enzymes, substrates, antibodies, antigens, hormones and reducible gases and the presence, concentration and activity of any of a variety of chemical and biochemical substances including the constituents of enzymatic systems e.g. serum enzymes, glucose, lactates, pyruvates, creatinine, urea and the constituents of the immunochemical system . There are many clinical situations, particularly in intensive care and during cardiac surgery, where a knowledge of blood pH and extracellular potassium activity pK can warn the clinician of impending problems. Blood pH is a useful indicator of respitory efficiency. The extracellular potassium level which can vary rapidly affects both heart rate and contractility, and can be critical in some cases. Knowledge of the activities of other ions, such as calcium and bicarbonate, is also useful in the clinical assessment of patients, and knowledge of the simultaneous activities of a plurality of ions is especially valuable as their concerted physiological action and interaction may permit more accurate diagnosis. A multiple function chemical transducer for this application would allow more precise computation of ionic activities because compensation could be made for imperfections in the selectivity of individual sensors by processing data from the transducer array in parallel. pH, pK and other ion activities can be measured with ion selective electrodes, although the large, conventional types are not well suited to clinical application due to their expense, fragility, bulk, high electrical impedance and large volume deadspace. A number of various types of ion selective electrodes are known, for example glass electrodes responsive to hydrogen, sodium, potassium and other ions in solution. Ion selective electrodes are not restricted to glass as electroactive material other solids such as lanthanum fluoride for a fluoride responsive electrode Frant, M.S., U.K. Pat. 1131 574 1968 U.S. Pat. 3 431 182 1969 , and a solution of the macrocyclic antibiotic valinomycin, in a suitable organic solvent, for a potassium responsive electrode have been described Simon, W., Swiss Pat. 479 870 1969 U.S. Pat. 3 562 129 1971 and extensively used. Such electrodes, used in conjuction with a reference electrode to form an electrochemical cell, have high electrical impedances, which requires that electrical connections to the electrode be carefully screened and insulated to minimize external interferences, and that a high impedance electronic circuit element such as a metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor MOSFET be used for signal amplification and or processing. Great advantages accrue from the incorporation of the electroactive ion sensitive material glass, lanthanum fluoride, valinomycin or other directly in contact with the active semiconductor device, thereby obviating such problems. The incorporation of several ion sensitive sites on to a single array of microelectronic semiconductor devices with associated miniaturization offers unique advantages in terms of robustness, size, mass fabrication potential, cost and application, with particular regard to biomedical usage. Such devices, now known as ion sensitive field effect transistors ISFETs , have been described in the scientific literature Janata, J. and Huber, R.J., Ion selective Electrode Rev, 1979 , A further major difficulty lies in restricting, and isolating physically, the chemically sensitive areas on the microelectronic device and maintaining the requisite electrical charateristics. For example, any electrical current flowing by the passage of charge carriers between the electrical connections to the active device and the electrolyte in contact with the chemoresponsive areas compromises the stability of the device. The present state of the art for device encapsulation is by crude methods such as brush encapsulation of epoxy resin under a microscope. The failure rate of devices fabricated by such techniques is high due to the penetration of electrolyte under the epoxy coating beyond the required boundary of the active area. This hand application of insulating material is labour intensive and hence costly, and is incompatible with the highly sophisticated state of the art for the mass production of electronic devices. Attention is drawn to this problem, but it is not solved, in two more recent disclosures in this field University of Utah, U.K. Pat. 1 529 743 Shimada, K., Matsuo, T. and Esashi, M., U.K. Pat. App. 2 010 011A . The first of these aforementioned disclosures concerns the use of electroactive materials other than hydrated silicon dioxide as the chemosensitive membrane used by ISFET devices. However, the formation of such films has been carried out by hand application under a microscope in a manner similar to that of the encapsulation material and is therefore not suited to the mass production of chemosensitive microelectronic devices. The second of these disclosures is concerned with devices having a similar sectional structure to those in the first disclosure, but radically different plan geometry which confers an advantage insofar as the encapsulation technology is, to some extent, improved, but still requires a degree of manual involvement. However, two major shortcomings are thereby introduced the process is not readily compatible with arrays of more than two devices selective to different chemical substances, and the extended, diffused source and drain regions, having high aspect ratios, greatly degrade the electrochemical sensitivity of the devices and introduce cross modulation problems and furthermore greatly increase the overall temperature dependance of the output signal. Reference is also made to EP A 0002343 which discloses an insulated gate field effect transistor having a chemically sensitive layer overlying a portion of a substrate other than that covered by the gate insulator. According to this document, the known IGFET can be operated in either an enhancement or a depletion mode. We assert that the electroactive materials used in the fabrication of chemosensitive microelectronic devices, and the manner of their application, must be compatible with mass production semiconductor technology for the successful development of microelectronic sensors of this nature. Furthermore, we consider the encapsulation material to be an important and integral part of the structure of the device, that the mode of application must be compatible with mass fabrication technology, and that the resistance to water and ion penetration must be adequate in this context. The aforementioned and other previous disclosures have been concerned with enhancement mode devices that is to say, devices where the source and drain regions are of a certain polarity and diffused into a substrate of opposite polarity. In order that such devices may function, a conduction pathway must be established between source and drain by the incorporation of an external voltage source in series with the potential reference electrode, in such a way that the device is biased correctly. Polarising potentials of this nature are highly undesirable for stable and reliable device performance as they contribute to charge carrier movement in the electroactive membranes, encapsulation material and encapsulation device interfaces. In contrast to previous disclosures, the present invention relates to devices operating primarily in depletion mode or enhancement depletion mode Sze, S.M., Physics of Semiconductor Devices, 1969 , John Wiley and Sons Inc., p. 538 where a permanent, lightly doped conducting channel between source and drain, and of the same polarity, is provided by diffusion, use of an epitaxially grown film, ion implantation or other means such that no gate bias voltage is necessary for satisfactory operation. The present invention is concerned with the solution of the aforementioned problems so that reliable, chemical sensitive FET transducers can be achieved at relatively low cost by improvements in keeping with the highly developed methodology of the semiconductor industry, and provides a suitable encapsulated microelectronic array of chemosensitive FET transducers for detecting and measuring the chemical properties of the solution phase to which the device is exposed. The invention provides an array of chemical responsive field effect transducers adapted to operate in a mode selected from depletion mode and enhancement depletion mode, comprising a chip of semiconductor material 3 having a plurality of pairs of adjacent, triangular diffusion regions 1,2 of a certain doping polarity located at the surface, the two diffusion regions of each said pair being arranged with two of their sides in parallel so as to delimit between them an elongate channel region 13 of the same doping polarity, at least one material selected from electrical insulator material 6 and ion barrier material 7 overlying each of the aforementioned channel regions an elongated rectangular coating of electroactive material 10 overlying each said insulator and or ion barrier material, such that the electroactive material will interact with substances to which it is exposed and control the charge carrier density in the aforementioned channel, each said pair of diffusion regions and associated channel region being symmetrically oriented about a common point on said chip in such a way that said elongated coatings extend radially from said common point, and a coating of polymeric material 11 encapsulating the surface of said chip except for a circular region B about said point which includes said plurality of pairs of diffusion regions. In accordance with one aspect of an embodiment of the present invention, the transducer array is fitted with a cuvette type cap to form a flow through analytical cell for the purposes of on line, ex vivo biomedical application, for example, where the assembly is required to be located remotely to the associated electronic signal processing system, for example, strapped to a patient s arm and connected directly to a locally placed intravenous catheter for the purposes of continuous or intermittent monitoring of blood electrolyte levels. This mode of operation confers both ethical and technical advantages, which are described hereinafter, over direct, in vivo application. The objects and additional features of the present invention will become apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with preferred embodiments with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which In the subsequently described embodiment of the present invention there is provided a suitably encapsulated array of chemosensitive field effect transducers engineered for depletion mode or depletion enhancement mode operation, and a means for the fabrication of the same using novel techniques and novel materials. The aforementioned array, fabricated on a single semiconductor element chip , comprises a plurality of discrete ISFET devices all being similar in structure with the exception of the electroactive substance or substances employed as the chemically responsive gate film by each device. We do not exclude from this specification an array of devices employing similar electroactive films for the purposes of increasing the accuracy of measurements, increasing the effective yield of device processing or other reason. Neither do we exclude the incorporation of other active or passive components on the same silicon element for the purposes of enhancing the performance or utility of the transducer array, such as signal multiplexers, amplifiers, compensatory devices or other elements. The following description, unless otherwise stated, pertains to a single device of which the aforementioned array is composed. The structure is shown in Fig 1 in front elevation, and is characterized by two adjacent, diffused, semiconductor regions 1,2 with certain polarity created on a substrate 3 of the same polarity, such that the diffused regions are heavily doped e.g. 10¬≤‚Å∞cm ¬≥ and permit ohmic, metallic connection, whereas the substrate material is only lightly doped e.g. 10¬π‚Å∑cm ¬≥ with impurities and therefore slightly electrically conducting. The substrate is mechanically supported by an insulator 4 as is common in state of the art silicon on sapphire SOS technology, or on semiconductor material of the opposite polarity to the diffused and substrate material, such that a metallic back connection 5 may be established. When this particular method of fabrication is used to create a plurality of devices on the same silicon element Fig 2A it is necessary to isolate individual devices with diffusions 12 deeper than, and of the opposite polarity to, the source 1, drain 2 and epitaxial layer 3, such diffusions being known as channel stoppers . Alternatively, the depletion mode channel can be created by local diffusion Fig 2B , for example the source 1 and drain 2 regions may be heavily doped n type material, the channel 3 lightly doped n type material, and the semiconductor bulk 4 lightly doped p type. A further technique sometimes used requires that the choice of processing materials and conditions is such that the surface of the bulk semiconductor is inverted changed in polarity and therefore lightly conducting Fig 2C . The surface of the device is covered by an isnsulating oxide film 6 which is typically thermally grown SiO‚ÇÇ and may be 50 nm thick over the channel between the diffused regions and 500 nm thick over the remaining surface. An ion barrier film 7 is formed on top of the SiO‚ÇÇ, for example 50 nm of pyrolitically deposited Si‚ÇÉN‚ÇÑ. Electrical connection is made to the diffused regions by etching holes through films 6, 7 using known photolithographic techniques and evaporating a metal film, typically aluminium 400 nm thick for connection to n type silicon, to form contacts to the surface 8 and drain 9. The composite gate insulator 6, 7 is coated with an electroactive material or materials 10 using well known thick film or thin film techniques for example, doped polymer ion selective membranes may be selectively deposited using a thick film screening process ion selective glasses may be deposited through a photoresist mask using the relief photomask technique to define the areas of deposition. The device, or array of devices is affixed to a header, which may be a CERDIP, TO 5 metal pack or other suitable mount known to the microelectronics industry, and wire bonding used to form electrical interconnections. The bonding wires, header surface and chip periphery are sealed with a suitable encapsulating agent 11 in such a way that only the chemosensitive areas of the devices remain exposed this process is detailed hereinafter and is facilitated by choosing an appropriate layout geometry for the device array, such as that shown in Fig 3 which represents a plan diagram of the 3.9 mm square NCL 03 chip. Heavily stippled areas represent heavily doped n type regions n lightly stipped areas represent semiconductor bulk material p black areas represent contact holes through gate dielectric and ion barrier films for electrical access by the metallization films, which are indicated by white areas, as will be readily appreciated and understood by those skilled in the art. The chip comprises four MOSFET devices and four chemosensitive devices all symmetrically orientated about an axes at 90 . Dotted circle B represents the encapsulant boundary, such that it surrounds the chemoresponsive areas of the four devices which must remain exposed while the rest of the chip is sealed during encapsulation. The square A represents the chemoresponsive area gate of the device in the upper left quadrant. Fig 4 shows a quadrant of the chip in greater detail, where dotted rectangle 13 represents a lightly doped channel region 3 in Fig 2B 5 is the bonding pad for connection to the semiconductor bulk 14, 15 and 16 are the MOSFET bonding pads connected to source, gate and drain respectively. The bulk and source connections of the chemoresponsive devices may be joined to form a common leadout in order to reduce the number of electrical connections required, or the array may be designed to have a common source region, with a plurality of associated channels and drains. An important aspect of the described embodiment is the encapsulating agent and means by which encapsulation is effected. Encapsulation is achieved by the use of materials such as Bis GMA, and adduct of bis phenol A and glycidyl methacrylate 2,2 bis p 2 hydroxy 3 methacryloxy propoxy phenyl propane , or Bis GMA urethane adduct, which are polymerized by U.V. irradiation or other appropriate means, and restricted physically in the area of their application by an appropriate directed jet of air or inert gas. Such polymeric materials employed for encapsulation have been applied in dentistry for the sealing of occlusal surfaces where the problems of electrolyte penetration under, and through, the polymeric layer are also of primary consideration Braden, M. et al, 1979 , J. Dent., With regard to the latter claim, this has been confirmed by sealing 5 mm diameter discs of electrolytically chloridised silver supported on Pyrex glass stems with such materials, and also with typically used sealing encapsulating agents epoxy cements and silicon rubber , and storing the electrodes in 5 saline over an extended period 185 days . Frequent, intermittent monitoring of the effective leakage resistances of the electrodes Table 1 confirms the superiority of the polymeric materials referred to over alternative agents most commonly used for ISFET encapsulation. In this context, we consider an effective leakage resistance of, or greater than, 10 The application of such materials, and subsequent polymerization, is carried out in the following manner, and as shown by Fig. 5. The microelectronic device array 17 is mounted onto a transistor or integrated circuit header 18, as hereinbefore described with appropriate wire bonded interconnections. A ring type collar 19 is affixed to the header 18 and around the device 17. This assembly is temporarily mounted on a jig 20, being capable of movement in the horizontal plane using an x y positioning drive, which is used to align the horizontally disposed semiconductor device surface underneath a jet of gas directed downwards onto, and orthogonally with respect to, the latter. The gas jet is supplied by a fixture 21 having a gas inlet port 23, a venturi 22 and a visible or near visible light source which may be a fibre optic terminator 24. The following parameters have been found to be useful gas flow rate, 0.5 1 min Furthermore, optical aids may be used to assist in the alignment of the gas jet with the chemoresponsive areas. Light from the fibre optic source 24 is collimated by the gas jet venturi 22 and provides a small illuminated area on the chip surface 17 which is, by necessity, accurately aligned with the central axis of the gas jet. The symmetrical structure of the device hereinbefore described Fig 3 is such that the optically induced drain currents flowing in the individual devices may be simultaneously processed electronically and the resulting information used to drive the aforementioned x y positioner, and hence jig 20, thus optimally servocontrolling the position of the device with respect to the gas jet and allowing fully automatic encapsulation. This is a significant improvement on prior art. The present invention confers the following advantages It must be noted that the selective encapsulation process and materials described hereinbefore are wellsuited to the encapsulation of any semiconductor sensor, including other types of chemical transducers such as the OG CHEMFET described in our British patent application No. 81 11198, gas sensors, pressure and temperature transducers and a variety of other devices or combinations thereof we do not exclude any of these from the scope of the present invention. The method of application of encapsulated chemosensitive semiconductor device arrays is shown in Fig 6, where the encapsulated device 27 comprises a header 18, device 17, collar 19 and encapsulating agent 11 as shown in Fig 5. The device 17 is that described by Figs 1 to 4. Consideration of a single element of the device array simplifies the following explanation. Lead out wires from the device source 32 and semiconductor bulk 33 are connected to ground 30. Drain connection 34 is connected to a low voltage source 31 typically 2 to 5V and the device is exposed to the electrolyte sample under analysis 35, shown in this instance in an open cuvette 28. The electrolyte sample is grounded with a conventional reference electrode 29 which may be a calomel, porous junction unit. No polarising voltage is necessary between reference electrode 29, and ground 30, as is required by previous disclosures concerned with enhancement mode sensors. The electrical potential in the bulk of the chemoresponsive film 10 Fig. 1 , with respect to the electrolyte, is determined by electrochemical reactions occuring at the film electrolyte interface and is dependant upon the chemical properties of the latter. This potential, referred to the semiconductor bulk 4 via the reference electrode 29, controls the electrical charge density in the channel between source 1 and drain 2 regions, and hence the electrical current flowing between source and drain under the influence of the external voltage source 31. Thus the device effectively transforms a signal related to chemical properties directly into a low impedance current source. The physical characteristics of the encapsulated devices render them ideal for flow through sensor application. Fig 7 shows an encapsulated device 27 as hereinbefore described, together with a flow through cap 36 having fluid inlet 38 and fluid outlet 37 ports. A low pressure applied to 37 with respect to 38 sucks fluid directly onto the sensor surface and provides an efficient flow through assembly with small volume deadspace which is ideally suited for connection to an intravenous catheter for the purpose of continuous or intermittent ex vivo, on line blood analysis in conjunction with local, inexpensive signal processing control hardware. This mode of operation is superior to in vivo application for the following reasons. The physical nature of the encapsulated device 27 is also ideal for the mass production of single function solid state ion selective electrodes, as the shape of the encapsulation material provides a former into which doped polymer films may be readily cast, using well known materials and methodology, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.
