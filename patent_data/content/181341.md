## Description
This invention relates to an infrared panel emitter and to a method of producing the same. Infrared radiation is that portion of the electro magnetic spectrum between visible light .72 microns µ and microwave 1000µ . The infrared region is subdivided into near infrared .72µ 1.5µ , middle infrared 1.5µ 5.6µ , and far infrared 5.6µ 1000µ . When an object passes in close proximity to an infrared source, infrared energy penetrates the material of that object and is absorbed by its molecules. The natural frequency of the molecules is increased, generating heat within the material, and the object becomes warm. Every material, depending upon its color and atomic structure, absorbs certain wavelengths of infrared radiation more readily than other wavelengths. Middle infrared is more readily absorbed by a greater number of materials than is the shorter wavelength near infrared radiation. One type of infrared source is the focused emitter. This type emits a specific wavelength of infrared energy usually in the near infrared region which is a wavelength easily reflected and not readily absorbed by many materials. To compensate for this lack of penetration the intensity of such emitters is increased and reflectors are used to focus the emission on the process area. Increased intensity causes increased power consumption, hotter emitter operation requiring cooling systems, shorter emitter life, and damage to temperature sensitive product loads which are being heated. Further, the condensation of process vapors on the reflector and emitter surfaces may cause a loss of intensity. Focused infrared sources generally require a substantial energy input, convert only 20 to 59 of the input energy to infrared radiation, and have a life expectancy of approximately 300 hours. A well known focused emitter is the T 3 lamp which consists of a sealed tubular quartz envelope enclosing a helically wound tungsten filament resistive element supported by small tantalum discs. The tube is filled with an inert gas such as a halogen or argon to reduce oxidative degeneration of the filament. Due to the different thermal expansion coefficients of the quartz and the metal lead wires adequate cooling must be maintained at the seals or lamp failure will result. The T 3 lamp, when at rated voltage, operates at a peak wavelength of 1.15µ with a corresponding filament temperature of 2246 C. Another commonly used focused emitter is the Nonfocused infrared panel emitters are available which operate on the secondary emission principle. Panel emitters contain resistive elements which disperse their energy to surrounding materials which in turn radiate the infrared energy more uniformly over the entire process area and across a wider spectrum of colors and atomic structures. The resistive element of such panel emitters is typically a coiled wire or crimped ribbon foil and is placed in continuous channels which extend back and forth across the area of the panel. The curved portions of the channels at each end of the panel area limmit the proximity of the wire or foil in adjacent channels. As a result, this construction limits the coverage of the panel area by the resistive element to 65 to 70 and this limited coverage makes it diffuclt to obtain precise temperature uniformity across the panel emitting surface. A particular example of a non focussed panel emitter is disclosed in US A 3 809 859, which consists of a primary emitter in the form of a heating wire arranged in a serpentine configuration, sandwiched between sheets of insulating material. A glass fibre sheet, which acts as a secondary emitter is attached to one of the insulating sheets. The serpentine heating wire is held in position between the insulating sheets by means of an anchor material composed of a slurry of fine brown clay and coloidal silica together with ceramic fibres. This acts as a binder, which sets when the primary emitter is energised. The curved ends of the heating element are not held by the binder to accommodate thermal expansion. The improved infrared panel emitter according to the present invention is characterised in that primary emitter is formed of a sheet of metal foil having an etched pattern and that a major face of said sheet has a void immediately adjacent thereto to permit thermal expansion and contraction of the foil. The invention also provides an improved method of making an infrared panel emitter characterised by the steps of inserting a mesh sheet immediately adjacent the primary emitter, and heating the primary emitter to form a void immediately adjacent the primary emitting means to permit thermal expansion and contraction thereof. The electrode pattern of the etched foil may cover from about 60 to about 90 of the total foil area, and preferably from about 80 to about 90 . The temperature variation across the panel emitting surface is less than 0.5 C. In a preferred example the primary emitter is attached to the mesh sheet to form a composite which is positioned adjacent an insulating layer. A slurry of a binder is applied to the composite and allowed to penetrate through to the insulating. The secondary emitter is then placed adjacent the composite to form an assembly. Additional slurry is applied to the emitting surface of the secondary emitter. The assembly is then heated at a low temperature preferably below 250 C to dry the moisture out of the panel components .The assembly is heated to a temperature preferably below 500 C to vaporise the mesh sheet and form the void for thermal expansion of the foil. The assembly is then heated to a higher temperature preferably above 800 C to bond together the secondary emitter, the primary emitter, and the insulating layer. The bonded panel emits infrared wavelength radiation in the middle and far infrared regions. Further characterising features can be adduced from the following decription of several illustrative embodiments given with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood that terms such as upper , lower , above and below used herein are for convenience of description only, and are not used in any limiting sense. In the drawings Figure 1 is a perspective and partial sectional view of a panel emitter according to the invention, Figure 2 is a partial plan view of the etched foil, Figure 3 is an exploded perspective view of components used in a method in accordance with the invention, and Figure 4 is a perspective and partial sectional view of the panel emitter in a housing and connected to a thermocouple. Figure 1 shows one preferrred embodiment of the panel emitter 10 of this invention. Panel emitter 10 may be of any desired shape and is shown for illustrative purposes only as being rectangular. Panel emitter 10 includes a primary emitter 12 disposed below an insulating layer 14 and a secondary emitter 16 disposed below the primary emitter. The lower surface of the secondary emitter is the panel emitting surface 19. The insulating layer 14 is electrically insulating and reflects infrared radiation to ensure efficient emission by the panel in one direction only, i.e., down in Figure 1. An insulating layer of from about 1.27 cm to about 7.62 cm in thickness can be used. For high temperature use the insulating layer should be made of alumina and silica and may be in blanket or board form. A preferred insulating layer is the 3.81 cm thick hot board made of alumina and silica, manufactured by the Carborundum Co., Niagara Falls, New York. The primary emitter 12 is a resistive element and its resistance to the current passing through it causes it to heat and emit primary infrared radiation. The primary infrared radiation emitted by the primary emitter is absorbed by the secondary emitter 16, which causes the secondary emitter to be heated and emit secondary infrared radiation. In a preferred embodiment the primary emitter 12 is a generally planar etched foil. The foil can be of any material having a high emmisivity factor, preferably greater than about 0.8, such as stainless steel. The foil should have a thickness of from about 0.0013 cm to about 0.013 cm. A preferred material is Inconel steel, made by United States Steel Corp., Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, having an emmisivity factor of .9 and a thickness of 0.0076 cm. Two terminals 11 and 13 having a thickness greater than the foil extend from the foil for connection to a current source. The terminals may extend through openings 15 and 17 in the insulating layer in see Figures 1, 3, and 4 . The foil is preferably spaced from about 0.32 cm to about 1.27 cm from all edges of the panel so the foil is not exposed and will not short circuit. For example, in a 30.48 cm x 45.72 cm panel, the foil has an 29.21 cm x 44.45 cm dimension and thus a 1.27 cm margin at each edge. This margin is small enough so that the secondary emitter at the margins can absorb and emit sufficient radiation to keep the entire 30.48 cm x 45.72 cm emitting surface at a uniform temperature. The etched foil pattern may be prepared by a known metal etching process. The pattern may cover of from about 60 to about 90 of the total foil area depending upon the wattage at which the panel will operate. Preferably the pattern is very closely spaced as shown in Figure 2 so as to cover at least about 80 to about 90 of the total area. The use of an etched foil permits the formation of a precise and closely spaced primary emitter configuration and permits greater panel area coverage than prior art emitters having metal strips which are bent or folded at each end of the panel. The primary emitter lies adjacent a very small void to permit thermal expansion and contraction of the primary emitter. This void is further described hereinafter in the method of making the panel emitter. The secondary emitter 16 consists of an electrically insulating, high emissivity material having an emitting surface 19 for emitting secondary infrared radiation. Preferably the secondary emitter 16 is a thin of from about 0.0813 cm to about 0.102 cm sheet, having a low mass, and an emmisivity factor of greater than about .8. A woven alumina cloth made by 3M Co., St. Paul, Minnesota, consisting of 98 alumina and 2 organic material, approximately 0.099 cm thick, and having an emissivity factor of .9, is preferred. An alumina paper made by The Carborundum Co., Niagra Falls, New York, and having approximately the same composition and thickness is another suitable example. Other materials which may be used to make the insulating layer and secondary emitter include silicon rubber and fiberglass. Preferably, an electrically insulating binder having a high emissivity factor, preferably of greater than about .8, is applied in slurry form to the panel components to aid in bonding together the secondary emitter, the primary emitter, and the insulating layer, as described hereinafter. The binder may be alumina and silica and should contain at least 20 silica by total weight of the slurry. A preferred material is QF180 sold by The Carborundum Co., Niagara Falls, NY, which in slurry form consists of 65 alumina, 25 silica and 10 water by total weight of the slurry. It is important that the coefficients of thermal expansion of the binder, the secondary emitter, and the insulating layer be nearly identical to prevent warping of the panel during bonding. With reference to Figure 3, the method of making one embodiment of the panel emitter 10 of the invention will now be described, like numbers refer to like parts, where appropriate . Primary emitter 12, is placed adjacent one surface of a mesh sheet 18 to form a composite. Insulating layer 14 is placed adjacent one surface of the composite and the terminals 11 and 13 are inserted through the openings 15 and 17 in the insulating layer. Preferably, a coating of the binder slurry is applied, for example, by brushing, to the top of the composite and allowed to penetrate through the openings in the mesh sheet and through the openings in the primary emitter and into the insulating layer. The excess slurry is then squeegeed off. The binder, the secondary emitter, and the insulating layer have nearly identical coefficients of thermal expansion. Secondary emitter 16 is placed adjacent the surface of the composite opposing the insulating layer to form an assembly. A coating of the binder slurry is applied to the emitting surface 19 of the secondary emitter and allowed to penetrate through the insulating layer. The excess slurry is squeegeed off. While two applications of the slurry is preferred, i.e., one to the composite and one to the assembly, it is sufficient to use only one application to the assembly so long as the slurry penetrates through to the insulating layer. Mesh sheet 18 may be positioned either between the insulating layer 14 and the primary emitter 16 or between the primary emitter 12 and the secondary emitter 16. Typically, the primary emitter 12 is first attached to the mesh sheet 18 for example, by gluing, and the mesh sheet is positioned adjacent the secondary emitter. The assembly is then heated slowly to a temperature and for a period of time to dry the moisture from the slurry out of the components, especially the insulating layer 14. For example, the assembly may be heated to a temperature of not more than about 150 C for 60 minutes. The assembly is then heated to a temperature and for a period of time to vaporize the mesh sheet 18, for reasons described hereinafter, and to vaporize the excess binder. For example, the assembly may be heated to a temperature below about 500 C for 60 minutes. The assembly is then heated to a temperature and for a period of time to bond together the secondary emitter 16, the primary emitter 12, and the insulating layer 14. By heating above about 800 C and preferably at about 1000 C for at least 60 minutes the silica in the binder vitrifies and bonds together the panel components to form a vitreous panel emitter. Further, depending upon how high a temperature is used, voids are eliminated within and between the insulating layer and the secondary emitter to form a sintered body. The mesh sheet 18 may be formed of any material which vaporizes at a temperature less than the temperature at which the components of the panel are bonded together. The purpose of the mesh is to support the primary emitter 12 during processing and to create a small void between the major face of the secondary emitter 16 and insulating layer 14 to allow unrestricted thermal expansion and contraction by the primary emitter 12 in the bonded panel emitter. The mesh sheet 18 may be placed either between the primary emitter 12 and the secondary emitter 16 or between the insulating layer 14 and the primary emitter 12, preferably the former. The openings in the mesh allow the binder to penetrate through to the insulating layer 14 to aid in bonding. The mesh preferably has a thickness of from about 0.025 cm to about 0.076 cm, has openings of at least about 0.32 cm, and vaporizes at a temperature below about 350 C. A preferred material is a loosely woven nylon mesh approximately .015 mil thick which decomposes at approximately 350 C. A preferred embodiment of the panel emitter made according to the method of invention is shown in cross section in Figure 1. The secondary emitter 16 consists of a woven alumina cloth. An etched foil 12 lies adjacent the alumina cloth 16 and can expand and contract within the void not shown left by the mesh sheet between the insulating layer 14 and the alumina cloth 16. An alumina silica binder not shown bonds together the cloth, foil, and insulating layer. The alumina cloth, alumina silica slurry, and alumina silica insulating layer are preferred, especially for use at high temperatures. The alumina content of the insulating layer and secondary emitter should be greater than about 70 by weight the binder slurry should contain from about 20 to about 50 silica by total weight of the slurry to achieve a vitreous bond. The coefficients of thermal expansion of the alumina cloth, alumina silica binder, and the alumina silica insulating layer are small and substantially identical namely, all about 0.1 shrinkage at 1000 C. Materials which shrink more than about 1 should not be used in the panel as it will warp during bonding. As shown in Figure 4, to provide additional support the bonded panel may be disposed in a steel housing 20 by connecting the insulating layer 14 to the housing 20 with ceramic lugs 21 and 23. Further, a vicor glass plate not shown , which is translucent to infrared radiation, may be applied over the emitting surface 19 to protect it from wear. A quartz tube containing a thermocouple 22 may be positioned in a channel in the insulating layer 14 and adjacent the primary emitter 12 for monitoring the temperature of the primary emitter 12. The panel emitter of the invention radiates infrared energy evenly and uniformly across its entire emitting surface 19. The temperature variation across the panel can be limited to 0.5 C or less. The panel emits a broad band of radiation in the middle and far regions and thus readily penetrates and is absorbed by materials having a wide range of colors and atomic structures. Within that broad band the panel emits a peak wavelength which can be adjusted within the broad range by varying the temperature of the primary emitter for selective heating of selected materials and colors within a product load. The panel emitters can be used for solder attachment of surface mounted devices to printed circuit boards. One type of panel emitter has been designed for this use having a peak temperature rating of 800 C which corresponds to a peak wavelength of 2.7µ. A 30.48 cm square panel emitter of the invention converts 80 to 90 of all input energy to process energy. Typically, this panel draws only about 4.5 amps at start up and drops to 2.2 amps after warm up. This panel is unaffected by occasional voltage variations often encountered in production environments. The life expectancy of the panels is typically 6,000 to 8,000 hours plus.
