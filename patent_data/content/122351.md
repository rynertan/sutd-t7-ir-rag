# Electro optical imaging system with diagnostic self testing facility.

## Abstract
An electro optical imaging system includes a light source 15 , a reference background 11 and a photosensitive device 21 such as a charge coupled array device, an output of which is coupled to a video processor 51B . Provision is made for self diagnostic testing. Thus, in a first mode of operation, the light source 15 is off, the output of the photosensitive device being applied to an integrator 59B , to provide an average value over a predetermined time, this value being digitized and applied to a diagnostic processor 57 . The output of the video processor 51B is digitized, and a digital value repre senting a centre pixel element in a scan is stored in a latch 55B coupled to the diagnostic processor 57 . The diagnostic processor 57 automatically compares the values applied thereto with a set of predetermined voltage values and pro vides an indication of failure or deteriorating condition according to the result of the comparison. In a second mode of operation, the testing is performed with the light source 15 on.
