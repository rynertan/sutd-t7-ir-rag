# Fast circuit switching system.

## Abstract
A fast circuit switching system that establishes a circuit for each packet sized data communication. Information is con veyed from a number of communications modules 2000 in source channels to a number of port controllers 4000 and to a network 5000 . Information is conveyed from the network to destination channels. Each communications module in cludes a transmitter that transmits in an associated source channel, circuit setup request signals defining destination channels and also transmits data. Each port controller stores one of a number of status words defining the availability of the destination channels and each of these status words is cycled to each port controller. A port controller responds to one of the circuit setup request signals and to subsequent data, when one of the status words cycled thereto defines as available a desti nation channel defined by the circuit setup request signal, by transmitting the circuit setup request signal and the sub sequent data to the network. The network responds to circuit setup request signals received from the port controllers by transmitting data received from the port controllers to the destination channels defined by those circuit setup request signals.
