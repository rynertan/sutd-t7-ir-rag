# Guiding and registering multiple sizes of diskettes in a floppy disk drive.

## Abstract
The loading mechanism 10 for a flexible disk drive is designed to load and center disk cartridges 44 of various thicknesses so that the disk within the cartridge is registered in a predetermined plane of rotation. A pair of guide rails, upper 28 and lower 30 , is mounted at each side of the insertion path for the cartridge. The upper and lower rails are movable relative to each other and relative to the frame of the disk drive. This allows the rails to separate to receive diskette cartridges having different thicknesses. After the cartridge is inserted, the loading mechanism will move the cartridge to a reference position where the disk within the cartridge is in the plane of rotation. The separation of the guide rails controls the reference position to which the cartridge is moved.
