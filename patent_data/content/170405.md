# Nonsmearing correction fluid.

## Abstract
Improved correction fluid for obscuring indicia on sheet material. Such fluid, which normally comprises a solution of pigmented thermoplastic resin, is rendered capable of obscuring typed, xerographically copied, or written ink indicia by using a solvent system having a refractive index of 1.410 or less. A preferred non flammable system includes 20 40 volume percent 1,1,2 trichlorotrifluoroethane and cor respondingly 80 60 volume percent heptane.
