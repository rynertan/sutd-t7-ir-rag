# Device for scraping off liquid.

## Abstract
The scraper device is bouyantly disposed in the liquid. The device has a scraping surface 12 which is grid like and has side walls 36, 37 bearing against the walls of the container. The grid configuration can be formed by U shaped strips 11 with the opening facing downwards in the liquid. The ends of the strips are connected to each other by the side walls which suitably are doubled so that the scraper device obtains a buoy ancy adapted to the viscosity of the liquid.
