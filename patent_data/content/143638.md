# METHOD FOR MAKING TUBULAR STRUCTURES FOR BIOMEDICAL APPLICATIONS

## Abstract
A method for making flexible porous tubular structures useful as synthetic vascular prostheses is disclosed. The number and size of pores can be controlled, and can be varied through the tube wall. The process comprises extruding a polymer solution salt dispersion through a tube dye in the presence of water, whereby the solvent and salt are extracted into the water leaving the plastic in a sponge like tubular form.
