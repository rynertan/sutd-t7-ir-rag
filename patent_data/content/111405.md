# CENTERLESS AND CENTER TYPE GRINDING SYSTEMS

## Abstract
A centerless grinding system comprises a driven grind ing wheel, a driven regulating wheel, and a work rest blade for centerless grinding of a workpiece supported by the work rest blade between the grinding wheel and the regulating wheel means for determining the rate of reduction of the workpiece radius while it is being ground and means responsive to the rate of reduction of the workpiece radius for controlling the ratio of the power consumed in removing workpiece material to the rate of removal of workpiece material by the grinding wheel. The regulating wheel is preferably fed toward the grinding wheel to feed the workpiece into the grinding wheel. In a similar centertype grinding system, the workpiece is mounted on spindles or chucks which are movable toward the grinding wheel so that the workpiece can still be fed by the regulating wheel. Workpieces longer than the axial dimension of the grinding wheel are ground in successive plunges along the length of the workpiece, with said ratio being controlled in each successive plunge. To grind hollow workpieces, the regulat ing wheel or grinding wheel is placed inside the hollow workpiece.
