## Description
The present invention relates to a nitride based ceramic cutting tool which shows superior wear resistance, thermal shock resistance and mechanical shock resistance, and is suitable for mass production. Heretofore, an Al₂O₃ TiC based material having superior wear resistance has generally been used as high speed cutting ceramic tools. These tools, however, are not suitable for use in high speed intermittent cutting such as milling, in which the tip is always subjected to thermal shock and mechanical shock, because of their insufficient thermal and mechanical shock resistances. In recent years, Si₃N₄ which is superior in toughness, mechanical strength and hardness and which has thermal shock resistance due to the fact that the thermal expansion coefficient thereof is as small as 3.5 x 10 ⁶ C, has received increasing attention as a ceramic material suitable for high speed intermittent cutting. However, in commercially producing ceramic tools using Si₃N₄, the following problems are encountered. Thus various investigations have been made to overcome the aforementioned problems. From JP A 81 032 377, there is known a nitride based ceramic cutting tool which is made by hot pressing of a powder mixture containing 63 by weight of SI₃N₄, 35 TiN and 2 Al₂O₃. From JP A 80 085 481, there is known a throw away tip comprising a sintered body mainly of SI₃N₄, which is hot pressed, and a coating layer of at least 1 of Al₂O₃ and AlON provided on the surface of the sintered body. The first mentioned nitride based ceramic cutting tool, however, is not improved in wear resistance to the extent desired. Also, the crater wear is reduced. In the last mentioned cutting tool, the coating layer has an undesirable tendancy to peel because of a large difference in the coefficients of the thermal expansion between the SI₃N₄ and the coating material. Both ceramic tools indicated above require hot pressing, which distinctly contributes to the overall production costs. In Chemical Abstracts Vol. 89 1978 , page 311, Abstract number 134483f, there is a sintered Si₃N₄ product of high mechanical strength disclosed which is made from a powdery composition consisting of 80 Si₃N₄, 10 Y₂O₃ and 10 Al₂O₃. From GB A 2 063 302, there are powdery mixtures known for the production of a sintered Si₃N₄ product containing e.g. 100 parts of Si₃N₄, 2 to 5 parts Al₂O₃, 1 to 4 parts AlN and 5 parts Y₂O₃ parts by weight . Pressure sintering as well as pressureless sintering at atmospheric pressure are well adapted methods for the production of fired nitride based ceramic articles. The thus obtained sintered articles whose bending strenght is as low as at most 490.5 N mm² 50 kg mm² do not have properties suitable for cutting tools. According to GB A 2 063 302, any sintering method can be employed, such as sintering at atmospheric pressure, pressurized sintering and sintering as hot isostatic pressing. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a nitride based ceramic cutting tool of the type generally indicated in the precharacterizing portion of claim 1, which exhibits a high wear resistance, high toughness, high crater wear resistance and high productivity. The above object is achieved first embodiment in that the nitride based ceramic tool comprises the Si₃N₄, TiN, and a sintering aid comprising 1 at least one of Y₂O₃ and Dy₂O₃ and 2 a mixture of AlN and Al₂O₃ containing from 5 to 60 by weight AlN, the weight ratio of 1 at least one of Y₂O₃ and Dy₂O₃ to 2 the AlN and Al₂O₃ mixture being from 3 1 to 1 3, in amounts such that the amounts of Si₃N₄, TiN and sintering aid falls within the ranges defined by straight lines connecting point A 84 by weight Si₃N₄, 5 by weight TiN, 11 by weight the sintering aid , point B 55 by weight Si₃N₄, 5 by weight TiN, 40 by weight the sintering aid , and point C 55 by weight Si₃N₄, 34 by weight TiN, 11 by weight the sintering aid in the triangular diagram Si₃N₄ TiN sintering aid Fig. 1 , said tool being produced by a cold press method. Within the above recited object of the present invention, it is intended to solve such a problem that when Al₂O₃ or ALON is coated on the silicon nitride sintered body of Japanese patent application OPI number 85481 80, the coating layer has an undesirable tendency to peel because there is a large difference in coefficients of thermal expansion between silicon nitride Si₃N₄ and the coating material. Fig. 1 is a triangular diagram showing the ratios of Si₃N₄ to TiN to the sintering aid that can be used in the production of the ceramic tool of the invention and Fig. 2 is a perspective view of a cutting tool, showing flank wear V The present invention also relates second embodiment to a nitride based ceramic cutting tool containing Si₃N₄, TiN and a composite oxide sintering aid, having a surface coating layer formed on the surface thereof, characterized in that the nitride based cutting tool comprises from 50 to 90 by weight Si₃N₄, from 5 to 45 by weight TiN and from 5 to 45 by weight a composite oxide sintering aid, said sintering aid comprising 1 at least one of Y₂O₃ and Dy₂O₃ and 2 Al₂O₃ alone or a mixture of AlN and Al₂O₃, said mixture comprising from 5 to 65 by weight AlN, and the weight ratio of 1 at least one of Y₂O₃ and Dy₂O₃ to 2 Al₂O₃ alone or the AlN and Al₂O₃ mixture being 3 1 to 1 3, said tool being produced by a cold press method. Preferred embodiments of the above indicated embodiment are defined in subclaims 3 through 6. The reasons for such constituents and layers as described above are discussed in more detail below. Si₃N₄ and TiN are main components of the cutting tool or substrate of cutting tool of this invention. In particular, Si₃N₄ is essential because of its excellent characteristics which has been described above. α Si₃N₄ is suitable to use as a starting material, and it is desirable for the grain size thereof to be 2 µm or less. TiN forms a dense disperse phase even at elevated temperatures and thus increases the toughness of the sintered body. Moreover, it has the effect of preventing crater wear when used in cutting tools. This effect, however, can be best obtained in the second embodiment when the amount of TiN added is at least 5 by weight. If the amount of TiN added is more than 45 by weight, the resulting sintered body is inferior in thermal shock resistance and is easily deteriorated. Hence, the TiN content in the second embodiment is within the range of from 5 to 45 by weight. The composite oxide sintering aid as used herein serves to improve the sintering properties of the above described main components and enables production of the desired cutting tool and substrate by a cold press method that permits mass production. If the amount of the composite oxide added is less than 5 by weight, these effects can be obtained only insufficiently. If the amount exceeds 45 by weight, the resulting cutting tool or substrate softens at elevated temperatures and is not as durable for cutting. Hence the composite oxide sintering aid content in the second embodiment is within the range of from 5 to 45 by weight. The weight ratio of at least one member of Y₂O₃ and Dy₂O₃ to Al₂O₃ is within the range of from 3 1 to 1 3 this being because the sintering properties are improved and the mechanical strength of the sintered body can be increased to the highest levels within this range. The weight ratio of at least one of Y₂O₃ and Dy₂O₃ to an AlN and Al₂O₃ mixture in the second embodiment containing from 5 to 65 by weight AlN is also within the range of from 3 1 to 1 3, again because the sintering properties are improved and the mechanical strength of the sintered body can be increased to the highest levels within this range. The AlN content of the AlN and Al₂O₃ mixture in the second embodiment should be from 5 to 65 by weight in order that the hardness is increased without lowering the strength. If the AlN content of the mixture is less than 5 by weight, the effect can be obtained only insufficiently, whereas if it is more than 65 by weight, the strength is lowered. A method of producing the cutting tool or substrate of the invention will hereinafter be explained. The cutting tool or substrate for cutting tool is produced by cold pressing a mixed powder of the above described components under an elevated pressure of at least 10,000 N cm², and firing the thus formed mold in an atmosphere of nitrogen at a temperature of from 1,550 to 1,750 C for a retention time of from 10 to 120 minutes. If the temperature does not reach 1,550 C, sintering cannot be attained, whereas if it exceeds 1,750 C, the Si₃N₄ component evaporates vigorously, causing a considerable degradation of surface roughness. The thus produced cutting tool is then polished in a predetermined form, and thereafter, a desired coating layer can be provided on the surface thereof if desired. This coating layer can be provided by physical vacuum deposition methods, such as ion plating and reactive sputtering, and a chemical vapor deposition method hereinafter referred to as a CVD method . Of these methods, the CVD method is preferred in that the component of the coating layer can be chosen within a wide range, and the reaction rate is high. In accordance with the CVD method, an Al₂O₃ coating layer is provided as follows In the formation of AlN, AlON, TiC and TiN coating layers, mixed gases at the left side of the equations 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 , respectively, as shown below are introduced into a reactor and reacted in the same manner as for the deposition reaction of the equation 1 . The coating layer may be a one layer structure, or a multi layer structure. In the case of the multi layer structure, an inner coating layer is first provided which is formed by any one or more of the deposition reactions represented by the above described equations 2 to 5 , and thereafter, an Al₂O₃ outer coating layer is provided utilizing the deposition reaction represented by the equation 1 . If the thickness of the coating layer is less than 0.3 µm, the effect of improving wear resistance is reduced. As the thickness is increased, the effect is increased. If, however, the thickness exceeds 5 µm, the resulting cutting tool is not suitable for practical use since the coating layer too easily peels apart from the substrate at the time of cutting. It is to be noted, however, that the coating layer or layers provided according to the invention are very difficult to peel apart as compared with conventional coating layers. The reason for this is believed to be that the coefficient of thermal expansion of TiN, 8.5 x 10 ⁶ C, is nearly equal to that of Al₂O₃, 7.8 x 10 ⁶ C, which is the principal component of the coating layer, therefore the incorporation of TiN into the substrate eliminates the large difference in coefficient of thermal expansion between the substrate and the coating layer, increasing the adhesion between the substrate and the coating layer. The present invention is described in detail by reference to the following examples. Si₃N₄ mean grain size 0.7 µm α Si₃N₄ content 90 , TiN mean grain size 2 µm , Al₂O₃ mean grain size 0.7 µm , Y₂O₃ mean grain size 1.2 µm and AlN mean grain size 1.2 µm relating to the first embodiment were mixed in the proportions shown in Table 1 and ground in a ball mill. The weight ratio of Al₂O₃ to AlN was set at 1 1. Then, 5 by weight of paraffin was added thereto, and the resulting mixture was press molded under a pressure of 15,000 N cm². The mold thus obtained, after the removal of the binder in a vacuum at 800 C, was sintered in an atmosphere of nitrogen at 1,650 C for 1 hour. The thus obtained sintered body was polished to produce a cutting test sample of SNG 432 Chamfer 0.1 mm and a sample for measuring a bending strength 4 x 8 x 25 mm . SNG 432 is prescribed in ANSI American National Standards Institute . The cutting performance was evaluated under the conditions as shown below. In Test 1, flank wear breadth V As can be seen from Table 2, if TiN is not added Sample No. 1 13 , K It has thus been found that a sintered body produced using a composition falling within triangle ABC as illustrated in Fig. 1 shows superior cutting performance compared with the one with compositions falling outside of the triangle ABC. Sintered bodies were produced in the same manner as in Example 1 using the compositions shown in Table 3. These sintered bodies were subjected to Test 1 of Example 1, and further to Test 3 under the conditions as shown below. RNG 432 is prescribed in ANSI. The results are shown in Table 3. As can be seen from Table 3, the wear in cutting of cast iron is improved by adding AlN this improvement is marked particularly in cutting of Inconel 718. Si₃N₄ powder α Si₃N₄ content 90 by weight mean grain size 0.7 µm , TiN mean grain size 2 µm , Al₂O₃ mean grain size 0.7 µm , Y₂O₃ mean grain size 1,2 µm , and Dy₂O₃ mean grain size 1.0 µm were compounded in the proportions as shown in Table 4, ground in a wet ball mill, and then dried. To 100 parts by weight of each mixed powder as prepared above was added 5 parts by weight of paraffin as a binder. The resulting mixture was kneaded and granulated, and cold pressed at an elevated pressure of 15,000 N cm². The thus obtained mold was fired in a vacuum at a temperature of 800 C for a retention time of 30 minutes to remove the binder and, thereafter, it was further sintered in an atmosphere of nitrogen at a temperature of 1,650 C for a retention time of 60 minutes to produce a sintered body. The sintered body was polished to prepare a bending test sample measuring 4 x 8 x 25 mm in size . In this way, Sample Nos. 3 1 to 3 9 were produced. Sample Nos. 3 1 to 3 5 each had the composition of substrate falling within the range as defined in the second embodiment of the invention, whereas Sample Nos. 3 6 to 3 9 were comparative examples in which the composition of substrate was outside the range of the invention. Also for comparison, a conventional sintered body comprising 70 by weight Al₂O₃, 25 by weight TiC, 4 by weight Nb₂O₅, and 0.1 by weight MgO was produced by a hot press method and polished in the same manner as above. This was designated as Sample No. 3 10 . These samples were measured for relative specific gravity, bending strength, and hardness. The results are shown in Table 5. The hardness is a Rockwell superficial hardness value by 45N scale. As can be seen from Table 5, the sintered bodies Sample Nos. 3 1 to 3 5 with the composition of substrate falling within the range of the second embodiment of the invention have excellent characteristics comparable to those of the conventional sintered body Sample No. 3 10 . On the other hand, the sintered bodies Sample Nos. 3 6 to 3 9 with compositions of substrate falling outside the range of the invention are seriously inferior in bending strength and slightly inferior even in specific gravity and hardness. This demonstrates that a sintered body to be used as a substrate for the cutting tool of the invention, having very desirable mechanical strength, sintering properties, and hardness as compared with conventional sintered bodies which are produced by a hot press method, can be produced by a cold press method as long as it has a composition falling within the range as described herein. Sintered bodies were produced in the same manner as above and polished in the form of SNG 432 Chamfer 0.1 mm x 25 . With each sintered body using as a substrate for the cutting tool, a coating layer as shown in Table 6 was provided on the surface thereof by the use of a CVD apparatus according to the second embodiment see claims 3 and 4 . In this way, Cutting Tool Nos. 3 1 to 3 9, 3 1a, 3 1b, 3 1c, 3 1d, and 3 1e were produced. Although the CVD apparatus is well known, since the rate of reaction and the thickness of the coating layer vary with conditions under which the apparatus is used, the conditions are described in detail below. H₂ and N₂ gases were introduced in amounts of, respectively, four times and seven times the theoretical ones, and the other gases were introduced in almost the theoretical amounts. The pressure in the reactor was maintained at 500 Torr 666 mbar in the case of deposition of TiN, and at 30 to 50 Torr 40 67 mbar in the case of deposition of other layers. Since the thickness of the coating layer varies also with the time for which the mixed gas is passed, preliminary experiments were made to confirm that Al₂O₃, AlN and AlON were each deposited in a thickness of 0.5 µm per unit time, whereas TiC and TiN were each deposited in a thickness of 1 µm per unit time. Based on these preliminary experiments, the time was determined so that the coating layer could be formed in the desired thickness. These cutting tools were subjected to Test I and Test II as described below under the conditions shown in Table 7. Test I A flank wear breadth V Test II The number of shocks applied till the tool was broken was measured this number is hereinafter referred to N . The results are shown in Table 8. For reference or comparison, Cutting Tool Nos. 3 1f, 3 5a and 3 10, with no coating layer provided thereto were tested under the conditions shown in Table 7. The results are shown in Table 8. Wear resistance was evaluated on the basis of V As can be seen from Table 8, the tools of the invention Cutting Tool Nos. 3 1 to 3 5, 3 1a, 3 1b and 3 1c in which the composition of the substrate falls within the range of the invention are greatly superior in wear resistance, thermal shock resistance, and mechanical shock resistance as compared with the tools Cutting Tool Nos. 3 6 to 3 9 with the substrate compositions falling outside the range of the invention. This demonstrates that when the same coating layer is provided, the excellent characteristics of each component constituting the substrate are exhibited by using it within the range of the invention. In addition, the tools of the invention Cutting Tool Nos. 3 1 to 3 5, 3 1a, 3 1b and 3 1c have superior characteristics compared with the reference examples and comparative examples Cutting Tool Nos. 3 1d and 3 1e falling within claim 4 but carrying layers of unsuitable thickness, 3 1f, 3 5a and 3 10 . This demonstrates that even if the substrate Si₃N₄ powder α Si₃N₄ content 90 by weight mean grain size 0.7 µm , TiN mean grain size 2 µm , Al₂O₃ mean grain size 0.7 µm , Y₂O₃ mean grain size 1.2 µm , Dy₂O₃ mean grain size 1.0 µm , and AlN mean grain size 1.2 µm were compounded in the proportions as shown in Table 9, ground in a wet ball mill, and then dried. To 100 parts by weight of each mixed powder as prepared above was added 5 parts by weight of paraffin. The resulting mixture was kneaded and granulated, and cold pressed at an elevated pressure of 15,000 N cm². The thus obtained mold was fired in a vacuum at a temperature of 800 C for a retention time of 30 minutes to remove the binder, and thereafter it was further sintered in an atmosphere of nitrogen at a temperature of 1,650 C for a retention time of 60 minutes to produce a sintered body. The sintered body was polished to prepare a bending test sample measuring 4 x 8 x 25 mm in size . In this way, Sample Nos. 4 1 to 4 9 were produced. Sample Nos. 4 1 and 4 5 each had the composition falling within the ranges of the first and second embodiment of the invention and Sample Nos. 4 2 to 4 4 each had the composition of substrate falling within the range of the second embodiment of the invention, whereas Sample Nos. 4 6 to 4 9 were comparative examples in which the composition was outside the range of the invention. Also for comparison, a conventional sintered body comprising 70 by weight Al₂O₃, 25 by weight TiC, 4 by weight Nb₂O₅, and 1 by weight MgO was produced by a hot press method and polished in the same manner as above. This is designated as Sample No. 4 10 . These sintered body samples were measured for relative specific gravity, bending strength, and hardness. The results are shown in Table 10. The hardness is a Rockwell superficial hardness value by 45N scale. As can be seen from Table 10, the sintered bodies Sample Nos. 4 1 and 4 5 and the sintered bodies Sample Nos 4 2 to 4 4 with the composition of substrate, falling within the ranges of the first and second embodiment or simply the second embodiment of the invention have excellent characteristics comparable to those of the conventional sintered body Sample No. 4 10 . On the other hand, the sintered bodies Sample Nos. 4 6 to 4 9 with compositions of substrate falling outside the range of the invention are seriously inferior in bending strength and moreover slightly inferior in specific gravity and hardness. This demonstrates that a sintered body to be used as a cutting tool or substrate for the cutting tool of the invention, having very desirable mechanical strength, sintering properties, and hardness as compared with conventional sintered bodies which are produced by a hot press method, can be produced by a cold press method as long as it has a composition falling within the range of the invention as described herein. Sintered bodies were produced in the same manner as above and polished in the form of SNG 432 Chamfer 0.1 mm x 25 and also in the form of RNG 432. With each sintered body as a substrate, a coating layer as shown in Table 11 was provided on the surface thereof by the use of a CVD apparatus. In this way, cutting tools Cutting Tool Nos. 4 1 to 4 9, 4 1a, 4 1b, 4 1c, 4 1d and 4 1e were produced. The CVD were made in the same manner as generally indicated in Example 3, with the specific data for specific Samples being set forth in Table 11 below. These cutting tools were subjected to Test I and Test II in the same manner as in Example 3. For comparison, Cutting Tool Nos. 4 1f, 4 5a and 4 10, with no coating layer provided thereon were also tested in the same manner as in Example 3. The results are shown in Table 12. As can be seen from Table 12, the tools of the invention Cutting Tool Nos. 4 1 to 4 5, 4 1a, 4 1b and 4 1c in which the composition of the invention are greatly superior in wear resistance, thermal shock resistance and mechanical shock resistance as compared with the tools Cutting Tool Nos. 4 6 to 4 9 with the substrate compositions falling outside the range of the invention. This demonstrates that when the same coating layer is provided, the excellent characteristics of each component constituting the substrate are exhibited by using it within the range of the invention. In addition, the tools of the invention Cutting Tool Nos. 4 1 to 4 5, 4 1a, 4 1b and 4 1c have superior characteristics compared with the reference examples and comparative examples Cutting Tool Nos. 4 1d, 4 1e, 4 1f, 4 5a and 4 10 . This demonstrates that even if the substrate The cutting tool of the invention, as described above, has very desirable mechanical strength and hardness as compared with conventional cutting tools, and is superior in wear resistance, thermal shock resistance, and mechanical shock resistance to conventional cutting tools. Hence the cutting tool of the invention is suitable for use in high speed continuous cutting, and moreover is suitable for mass production since it can be produced by a cold press method. The nitride based sintered body of the invention is useful not only for cutting tool, but also for heat resistant and wear resistant mechanical parts which are subjected to vibration and heat, such as a drawing die and an impact die.
