## Abstract
A semiconductor laser device comprises at least an optical confinement region constituted by first, second, third and fourth semiconductor layers 2...5 provided on the upper part of a predetermined semiconductor substrate 1 in contact with each other successively, the first and fourth semiconductor layers 2, 5 being smaller in refractive index than the second and third semiconductor layers 3, 4 , the third semiconductor layer 4 being larger in refractive index than the second semiconductor layer 3 , the second and fourth semiconductor layers 3, 5 being larger in forbidden band width than the third semiconductor layer 4 and at least the first and fourth semiconductor layers 2, 5 being opposite in conductivity type to each other. The optical confinement region is formed into a mesa stripe, both side walls of which substantially parallel to the traveling direction of a laser beam are embedded with a fifth semiconductor layer 7, 8 , and the width of the second semiconductor layer 3 in a section perpendicular to the traveling direction of the laser beam and in the direction parallel to a junction within the optical confinement region is made larger than that of the third semiconductor layer 4 . A large output is ensured by this semiconductor laser device.
