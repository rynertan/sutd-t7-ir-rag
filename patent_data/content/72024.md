# MOLDING OF UNSATURATED POLYESTER

## Abstract
The method of curing unsaturated polyester with a hydroperoxide based curing agent is improved by em ploying isocyanate and at least one isocyanate reactive accelerator that is exothermically reactive with the isocyanate to generate heat to accelerate the gellation und curing reaction between the polyester and its curing agent. Dilution of the polyester with a monomer cross linking agent, especially styrene, enables impinge ment mixing under high pressure and rapid filling of molds. Preferably an excess of isocyanate reacts, commencing prior to gellation of the resin, with a com ponent of the mixture, preferably the hydroperoxide, to cause formation of small gas bubbles to prevent shrink age and, where desired, to expand the mixture. An improved curing agent for the unsaturated polyester comprises a buffered equilibrium system of a limited quantity of un ionized hydroperoxide and a salt of the hydroperoxide that is soluble in the resin, preferably formed by reacting hydroperoxide with an amine that serves as a weak base. By selection of an amine that is also reactive with isocyanate, the amine can perform in both buffering and polyester cure accelerating ac tions. A thixotropic additive enables use of a high level of reinforcement fibres in the fluid resin and a heat conductive additive permits molding of thick sections while achieving good surface finish.
