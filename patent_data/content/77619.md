# Data packet driven digital computer.

## Abstract
A digital computer having an addressable store 1 , which may comprise segments 1a , 1b , etc. and a plurality of independent digital processing units 3a , 3b , etc., all communicating with the store 1 though a communication facility 2 . Addresses in store 1 containing packets of digital data which require processing are held in a group of identifier stores 4a , 4b , etc., to which group the processing units all have access. Where processing results in the generation of fresh packets of data addresses for such data in store 1 they are held in a second group of identifier stores 5a , 5b to which the processing units also have access. Controllers 6a , 6b , etc. and 7a , 7b , etc. even out the number of identifier address 5 among the stores of a group by transfer from one identifier store to another and act as interfaces between the identifier stores and the processing units.
