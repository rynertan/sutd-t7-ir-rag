# POLYAMIDES OF BIS AMINOMETHYL TRICYCLODECANE

## Abstract
Polyamide resins are disclosed of polymeric fat acids or certain dicarboxylic acids derived from a fatty acid and a bis aminomethyl tricyclodecane. Copolymerized acids or diamine or amino acids may be present. Because of the greater rigidity of some of the resins in addition to the other desirable properties of the polymeric fat acid polyamides, more application areas are opened such as the injection molded or extruded structural parts and components.
