# Coating compositions.

## Abstract
Coating compositions which cure on baking to provide hard and flexible coatings characterized by superior abrasion resistance and mar resistance comprise 1 a polyol component which is an adduct of at least a stoichiometric proportion of ethylene oxide or propylene oxide with a bisphenol 2 a solution copolymer containing from 40 to 70 of isobutyl acrylate, 3 to 20 of hydroxy alkyl ester of a monoethylenic carboxylic acid, up to about 20 of monoethylenic carboxylic acid, and any balance consisting essentially of monomer containing a single ethylenic group and no other reactive group and 3 aminoplast resin. The polyol constitutes from 20 to 40 of the three named components, the copolymer is present in an amount of from 85 to 150 of the polyol, and the balance of the three named components is the aminoplast resin. Carnauba wax is present in an amount of from 0,454 to 4.54 kg 1 to 10 pounds of wax solids per 379 liters 100 gallons of coating composition. When the coatings are baked, the carnauba wax blooms to the surface and resists volatilization.
