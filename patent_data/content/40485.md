# Tube fittings, couplings for tubing and fluid connector joints.

## Abstract
A quick connect fitting for air brake tubing consists of a body member 10 with a tubing support 12 therein and a nut 18 threadedly connected to the body 10 . A split ring grip ping sleeve 36 having a conical outer surface 39 cooperates with the conical inner surface 23 of the nut 18 to receive and retain inserted tubing 25 . A ring seal 28 is disposed in the body member 10 to provide a primary seal 24 between the body 10 and nut 18 and includes a surface in engagement with the gripping sleeve 36 to maintain alignment of same with the conical surface, limit the inward movement of the sleeve 36 and bias the sleeve 36 toward the conical surface 23 to enhance the grip 36 . An o ring in the nut 18 provides a seal 24 on the outer diameter of the tubing 25 and a metal to metal further seal is provided between body 10 and nut 18 external of the threads 19 therebetween. Disconnec tion is achieved by unthreading the nut 18 from the body 10 .
