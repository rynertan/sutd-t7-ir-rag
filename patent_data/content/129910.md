# X ray diagnostic apparatus for allowing stereoscopic visualization on X ray images of an object under examination.

## Abstract
An X ray diagnostic apparatus 100 for allowing stereos copic visualization on X ray images of an object 3 under examination includes at least a stereoscopic X ray tube 1 , a deflection coil type image intensifier 4 5 , and a single televi sion camera 7 . The right viewed and left viewed X ray visual images are alternately ouput from the image intensifier 4 5 with a given deviation between centers of those images. Those visual images are alternately incident upon the respec tive image conversion regions of the TV camera 7 , whereby the electrical scanning is also done alternately for each of the image conversion regions so as to prevent the after image effect.
