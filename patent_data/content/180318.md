## Description
This invention relates to pyrazolo 3,4 b pyridine amides which are anxiolytic agents. According to the present invention there is provided a compound of formula I wherein A particular acid addition salt is one formed with hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric or nitric acid. A particularly preferred group of compounds are those of the formula I in which Ra is alkynyl, with the most preferred compounds being those having a triple bond in the 3 or 4 position. The most preferred compound is 4 amino 1 pent 3 ynyl 1H pyrazolo 3,4 b pyridine 5 N 2 propenyl carboxamide and its hydrochloride salt Example 20 . Compounds of the formula I may be prepared by methods known in themselves for the manufacture of chemically analogous compounds. Thus the following processes are provided as further features of the invention, Ra, Rb, Rc and Rd having the meanings stated above unless indicated otherwise. The starting material of the formula II for use in process a may be prepared by alkynylation of a compound of formula V where Rf is 1 6C alkyl, for example, ethyl 4 ethoxy 1H pyrazolo 3,4 b pyridine 5 carboxylate to give a compound of formula VI with subsequent reaction of the compound of Formula VI with an amine of the formula Rb NH₂ and, if necessary, hydrolysis of the ester to form the corresponding acid from which a suitable activated derivative such as an acid chloride may be prepared if required , for example as illustrated in Example 19. The starting material of the formula III for use in process c may be prepared in a similar manner, but omitting the first alkynylating step and reacting the acid or activated derivative with an appropriate amine to get a compound of formula III. The compounds of material V may be prepared as follows A compound of formula VII, where Rg is hydrogen or an alkyl, e.g., 1 6C alkyl, is reacted with N bromosuccinimide NBS to give a compound of formula VIII A compound of formula VIII may then be reacted under acidic or basic conditions for example, Na₂CO₂ in water or aqueous hydrochloric acid in acetylnitrile to give a compound of formula V. Compounds of formula VII may be made by the methods described in U.S. Patent 3,755,340 to Hoehn et al. The starting material of the formula IV for use in process d may be prepared by hydrolysis of an ethyl 1 alkynyl 1H pyrazolo 3,4 b pridine 5 carboxylate derivative of formula VI carrying the group Re for example, ethoxy in the 4 position, followed by reaction of the 5 carboxylic acid, or an activated derivative thereof, with an amine of the formula RcRdNH in a process analogous to process a . As indicated above, the compounds of the present invention are anxiolytic agents.

The pharmaceutical composition may, for example, be in a form suitable for oral, rectal or parenteral administration, for which purposes it may be formulated by means known to the art into the form of, for example, tablets, capsules, aqueous or oily solutions or suspensions, emulsions, dispersible powders, suppositories or sterile injectable aqueous or oily solutions or suspensions. A preferred pharmaceutical composition of the invention is one suitable for oral administration in unit dosage form, for example a tablet or capsule which contains between 5 mg. and 500 mg. of the amide derivative, or one suitable for intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous injection, for example a sterile injectable containing between 0.1 and 10 w w of the amide derivative. The pharmaceutical composition of the invention will normally be administered to a mammal for relief of anxiety and tension in the same manner as that employed for chlordiazepoxide, due allowance being made in terms of dose levels for the potency and duration of action of the amide derivative of the invention relative to chlordiazepoxide. Thus each individual will receive an oral dose of between .5 mg. and 200 mg., and preferably between .5 mg. and 50 mg., of amide derivative, or an intravenous, subcutaneous or intramuscular dose of between .05 mg. and 50 mg., and preferably between .05 mg. and 10 mg., of the amide derivative, the composition being administered one to four times per day.
