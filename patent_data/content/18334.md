# Apparatus for transmitting information on an alternating current line.

## Abstract
Information is transmitted on one of the phase conduc tors of an a.c. line in a form of a series of short duration pulselike amplitude reductions in the voltage during one and the same half cycle, whereat the pulses form a binary code word representing the information. These reductions are generated by means of a current transformator 14 in series in the phase conductor 4 . The secondary winding is short circuited by a transistor 15 controlled by a control unit 6 to be opened for a short duration for each desired pulse. When the transistor 15 is opened, a voltage re gulator 17 connected across the secondary winding restricts the change in magnetic flux in the transformator core to a maximum value dependent upon the lenght of the impulse series. The current is held over a given miniumum value during a transmission by a current regulator 27 and by connecting a load 28 to the phase conductor 4 .
