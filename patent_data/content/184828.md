# Vector processing apparatus.

## Abstract
The vector processing apparatus fetches vector oper ands designated by an instruction from a storage 104, 105 to an operand buffer 707, 708 in a vector processor 7 . The vector processor reads out and processes the elements of the vector operands stored in the operand buffer. The vector processor controls fetching of the element to be next pro cessed from the operand buffer in accordance with the operation result. Thus, a vector operation of a type in which the increment of the indices of the vector operands depends on the operation result is carried out.
