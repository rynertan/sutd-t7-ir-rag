# Device for exchanging masks.

## Abstract
A device for exchanging masks used in the photolithog raphic treatment of semiconductor devices comprises a rotatable disk 1 , on which supporting places for a number of masks 5, 6 are present, which disk can be arranged by rotation in a position in which one of the mask supporting places is in a position desired for photoiithographic treat ment, said position can be determined by means of a detector 19 , which, after a position servo system has been switched into circuit, supplies a detector signal to this system and thus controls the adjustment of the disk. For rotation of the disk 1 , two electromagnetic movement systems 7, 13 8, 14 are present each comprising a magnet and a coil, wherein either the pair of magnets or the pair of coils is fixedly arranged and the other pair is provided on the turntable and is rotatable therewith, a current connection for the coils being present to supply a constant current to the coils.
