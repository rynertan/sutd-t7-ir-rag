# HYBRIDOMA CELLS SECRETING A MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY SPECIFIC FOR 5 BROMO AND 5 IODODEOXYURIDINE AND REAGENTS FOR MEASURING CELLULAR PROLIFERATION

## Abstract
Cells synthesizing DNA are detected in a rapid, non radioactive assay using the monoclonal antibody reagent secreted by the hybridoma produced by fusion of a myeloma cell, preferably murine plasmacytoma cell, with an animal antibody producing cell, preferably a mouse spleen cell, immunized with the conjugate of 5 bromouridine or 5 iodouridine and an albumin carrier molecule. The antibody is specific for 5 bromodeoxyuridine or 5 iododeoxyuridine.
