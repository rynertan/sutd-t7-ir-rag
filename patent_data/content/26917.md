# Improved rendering methods and systems.

## Abstract
Renderable material is ground and mixed with oil to form a slurry which is then cooked under vacuum in an evaporator to remove some moisture. The resulting partial ly dewatered slurry is partially deoiled, and the solids resi due resulting from deoiling is cooked in a cooker to re move additional moisture. The hot vapors generated by cooking the material in the cooker are used in the steam jacket of the evaporator. Preferably the dewatered solids residue from the cooker is further deoiled.
