# CORRECTING DEVICE

## Abstract
A correcting device for use, for example, for masking and allowing overprinting of errors on a typescript or the like is disclosed comprising a light transmitting backing release sheet 10 , with areas of masking material 12 carried on one face of the backing release sheet 10 , the release sheet being of larger overall area than the overall area of said masking material 12 . Each area of masking material 12 is adhesive, under pressure, on its face remote from the backing sheet 10 , whereby by placing the release sheet over an area of a receiving sheet of which an area is to be masked, so that the masking material is disposed between the release sheet and the receiving sheet, and applying pressure over the area of the masking material on the face of the release sheet remote from the masking material, the area of masking material can be transferred to the receiving sheet.
