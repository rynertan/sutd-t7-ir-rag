# Programmable counter timer device.

## Abstract
A counter timer device includes a plurality of registers 105 each capable of performing any of the function of a count er timer register, the function of a capture register and the function of a compare register, in accordance with a command from a central processing unit, and a plurality of task registers 103 corresponding to tasks which are to be carried out by us ing the above registers. Each of the task registers stores a task instruction for specifying a counter timer register and a capture compare register which are used in a task, and for specifying the operation mode of each of the specified regis ters. The task registers are scanned to successively read out the task instructions, and each of the read out task instruc tions controls the operation of each of registers used in a corresponding task. Thus, tasks corresponding to the task in structions are all carried out at once.
