# Image sensor device.

## Abstract
An image input device comprises an image source 11 which generates an image light and a light sensor 12 facing the image source. The image light is divided into a number of components by an image dividing device 13, 14, 15 . The light sensor 12 contains a number of photoelectric convert ing elements, the number of photoelectric converting ele ments being smaller than the number of components constituting the image light. The image dividing device is placed between the light sensor and the image source to divide the image light into components in a predetermined timed order. The photoelectric converting elements are thereby irradiated in the predetermined timed order and the electrical signals generated by these photoelectric elements are read out in this same predetermined timed order and stored in a memory.
