# Process for the catalytic conversion of methanol to hydrocarbons.

## Abstract
A process wherein methanol is contacted, in the pre sence of hydrogen, over a ruthenium titania catalyst to produce, at reaction conditions, an admixture of C₁₀ linear paraffin and olefins, which can be further refined and upgraded to high quality middle distillate fuels, and other valuable products such as mogas, diesel fuel, jet fuel, lubes, and specialty solvents, especially premium middle distillate fuels of carbon number ranging from about C₁₀ to C₂₀.
