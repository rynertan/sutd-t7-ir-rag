# MOTOR VEHICLE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM

## Abstract
A multivoltage electrical system for a motor vehicle that has a pair of storage batteries 50,54 which, in a first charging mode are charged in series from the direct voltage output terminals 28,30 of a bridge rectified 24,25 con nected to an alternating current generator 10 . In a second charging mode, only one of the batteries 50 is charged and this takes place when a plurality of controlled rectifiers 72 connecting the generator and a common junction 52 of the batteries are gated conductive. The switching between modes is a function of the voltage of one of the batteries and the voltage of a triangular voltage waveform generator 84 operating at a fixed frequency, and or the system is main tained in the second mode by means 80 when generator speed is below a predetermined value.
