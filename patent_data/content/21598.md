# A kinetic method for directly determining total bilirubin.

## Abstract
A kinetic method for directly assaying total bilirubin in a sample. The kinetic assay entails mixing the sample to be assayed with an azo reagent and measuring the rate of formation of azobilirubin, wherein the rate of azobilirubin formation is directly proportional to the concentration of bilirubin in the sample being assayed. The azo reagent comprises a diazotized aromatic amine and accelerator and the composition and pH thereof is selected such that the rate constants for the conjugated and unconjugated reactions are approximately equal and such that the half lives of both reactions are greater than 1 second and less than 5 minutes.
