# Improved jump seat assembly.

## Abstract
A jump seat 22 with a raised back portion 24 and a seat portion 26 hinged thereto and spring biased automatic movement from a horizontal operative position to a raised stored position. The seat back portion 24 holds such spring 40 and is hinged to the vertical arm 32 of a wall bracket, which may contain a second spring so that when the seat portion 26 is in the stored position, the seat 22 can be controllably swung into a flat stored position against the wall bracket 30 . The horizontal portion 34 of the bracket 30 includes a raised post and recess 58 with sloped walls easily releasaby seating with and disengaging from the underside of the seat portion 26 . The seat 22 includes a fully adjustable safety belt array 90 having a pair of parallel vertical shoulder belts 96, 98 releasably separately hooked to a pair of transverse belts 92, 94 . The shoulder belts 96, 98 pass through openings in the seat back 24 and spaced guideways, over a roller and down into a recessed take up reel 104 which winds them in side by side non overlapping relation for minimal belt bulge.
