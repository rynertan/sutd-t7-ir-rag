# Magnetic seal apparatus for magnetically permeable shaft.

## Abstract
A self activating seal is formed by inserting a magnetically permeable shaft 16 into a module which comprises a magnet 12 , two pole pieces 18 and a magnetic fluid 20 . The module is so constructed that the magnet 12 and pole pieces 18 form a cavity for storing the magnetic fluid 20 until the shaft 16 or similar element is inserted. Upon insertion of the shaft 16 , the magnetic field is altered and the flux path diverted to the small gaps separating the pole pieces 18 and the shaft 16 . The magnetic fluid 20 is drawn to the gaps to form hermetic seals. The cavity can be sealed prior to use by a sealing ring extending between the free ends of the pole pieces 18 and provided with sealable holes operable to release the fluid from the cavity for diversion to the gaps.
