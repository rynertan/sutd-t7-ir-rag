# Pipe union for cryogenic fluids.

## Abstract
A union for joining pipes, tubing, or other fluid conduits in a fluidtight manner includes male and female parts having respective inner fluid passages. The male part has a contoured lead end that slidably engages the female lead end which has a complementary contour with respect to the male lead end. The male lead end has a circumferential recess which retains a resilient sealing member which is radially compressed between the mated, contoured lead ends when the male and female parts are joined together. Clamping means is provided to hold the male and female parts together, but the fluidtight seal is independent of the clamping means. The mated contoured lead ends substan tially eliminate transverse movement at the sealing interface and permit a camming action when the male and female parts are joined so as to self align the respective inner passages.
