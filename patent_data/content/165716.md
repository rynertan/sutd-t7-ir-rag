# Simultaneous multiple assays and compositions useful therein.

## Abstract
The present invention is concerned with coordinated compounds useful in simultaneous multiple assays for organic species such as steroids, proteins, peptides, car bohydrates or drugs. The coordinated compounds are prepared by labelling an individual organic species with a radioisotope through a chelating agent to form a coordinated compound. The present invention is also concerned with composi tions comprising two or more of the coordinated com pounds, compositions comprising one or more of the coordinated compounds and an analyte labelled with I 125, and a simultaneous multiple assay wherein one or more of the coordinated compounds is are employed.
