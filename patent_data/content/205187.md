# Optical disc memory with liquid crystal.

## Abstract
An improved magneto optical disc memory with a fer roelectric liquid crystal FLC is shown. As FLC a chiral smectic liquid crystal is employed to exhibit a bistability between a pair of substrates which have easy polarization axes normal to each other. Informations to be recorded are written on the disc in terms of a binary system by use of the bistability.
