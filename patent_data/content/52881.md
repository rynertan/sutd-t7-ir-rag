## Description
CURABLE MOLDING COMPOSITION AND ITS USE FOR PRODUCING THERMO SET FIBER REINFORCED z D MOLDED ARTICLES This invention relates to a thermosettable fiber reinforced resin composition containing thermosetting resins based on polyurethanesand unsaturated polyesters formed from poly acrylates . U.S. Patent 3,700,752 describes a process for the preparation of shaped polymeric articles by gelpolymerizing a homogeneous composition comprising at least one vinyl monomer and the precursors of a crosslinked polyurethane and shaping the composition at a stage when it is still fluid, in which the composition comprises from 5 to 95 by weight of cross linked polyurethane precursors free of groups copolymerizable with vinyl monomer and from 95 to 5 by weight of at least one vinyl monomer, and the gellation of the resin via formation of the polyurethane is substantially completed before polymerization of the vinyl monomer is allowed to proceed to the extent that the vinyl polymer so produced forms a separate phase, and thereafter polymerization of the vinyl monomer is completed. The vinyl monomers are described as including esters of acrylic acid.The urethanes suitable for use in U.S. 3,700,752 are such that the cross link density of these urethanes is lower than those of the present invention. The patent states in column 12 that the notch impact strengths of the products produced can be improved by incorporating fibrous reinforcement in the product in proportions of 10 to 50 by weight of the total weight of the fiber reinforced product. The instant polyurethane polyester resin systems are especially suited to produce thermoset molded articles by rapid injection molding techniques. The polyurethane polyester resin systems of this invention are not gelled via formation of the polyurethane prior to molding as the resins in U.S. Patent 3,700,752. U.S. Patent 4,098,733 describes that polyurethanes and vinyl polymer composites are rapidly prepared without the requirement of the application of an external source of heat by the admixture of a composition comprising A a liquid polyol, B an organic polyisocyanate, C a liquid ethylenically unsaturated monomer, D a catalyst for polymerizing component C , E a catalyst for urethane formation, F 0 to 50 by weight based upon the combined weights of components A , B , C , D , E and F of a modifier substance.The modifier substances are stated, in column 2 of the patent, as selected from l liquid substances having an atmospheric boiling point of at least about 150 C 2 solid substances having a surface area of less than about 0.8 m2 gram and a particle size such that it will pass through a 1 4 inch square opening and will not decompose at a temperature below the maximum exotherm temperature generated by the urethane forming reaction C3 particular polymers of one or more ethylenically unsaturated monomers and 4 mixtures thereof. Several provisos are then stated, one of which is that the combined quantity of components C and F be less than about 60 by weight based upon the combined weights of components A , B , C and F . The admixed composition is stated to be then poured into a suitable mold wherein the composition solidifies within about 15 minutes to a solid having a density of at least about 1 g cc and a percent elongation of less than about 100. Suitable components stated as component F2 , i.e., the solid substances, in the patent are described in column 11 as including solid modifiers such as the woven or mat materials wherein the individual fibers from which such materials are prepared have a surface area of less than 0.8 m2 gram and which will pass through a 1 4 inch square opening. Of the 87 Examples of this patent, only twoExamples, i.e., Examples 10 and 11 describe an acrylate component. Example 10 of this patent describes blending the following components 50 grams of Polyol A defined in column 10 as an adduce of glycerine and propylene oxide, said adduct having an active hydrogen C0H equivalent weight of about 87 , 50 grams of PolyisocyanateA defined in column 10 as an 80 20 mixture by weight of 2,4 and 2,6 toluenediisocyanate having an isocyanate equivalent weight of about 87 , 50 grams of styrene, 50 grams of the trimethacrylate ester of trimethylol propane, 0.4 grams of tertiarybutyl perbenzoate and 1.14 grams of lead octoate.Example 11 describes blending the following components 50 grams of Polyol A, 50 grams of polyisocyanate A, 50 grams of styrene, 24 grams of the dimethacrylate ester of 1,3 butylene glycol, 0.3 grams of tertiary butyl perbenzoate, and 1.14 grams of lead octoate. Example 86 of this patent describes blending the following components 0 grams of Polyol A, 50 grams of Polyisocyanate A, 50 grams of styrene, 1 gram of tertiary butyl perbenzoate and 0.23 grams of lead octoate.The mixture is poured over 35 grams of glass fiber cloth having a surface area oft0.3 m2 grams. Only this Example of the patent describes a composition added to glass. Therefore, according to U.S. Patent 4,098,733 component F is optional and limited in its use since the composition can contain 0 to 50 by weight of this component. The amount of glass reinforcement which can be added is also constrained by limits on the total amount of polyester and component F in the composition. These limitations exclude those compositions which we have found to offer optimum mechanical properties. Also, this component F is described as selected from one of four components, i.e., 1 to 4 , supra, with only one Example describing glass fiber cloth. In the instant invention, it has been found that thermosetting resins based on polyurethane and unsaturated polyesters formed from poly acrylates2, containing fiber reinforcement produce molded articles with an excellent combination of mechanical properties.Composites prepared from the polyurethane and unsaturated polyester resins of this invention have a combination of physical properties superior to those of composites prepared from either polyester resins or polyurethane resins.

The instant resin system is especially suited to produce thermoset fiber reinforced molded articles by rapid injection molding techniques. The resin system herein has a low viscosity, so that it can be used to produce thermoset resin articles containing up to about 75 weight percent of reinforcing fibers. The molded articles are produced by a mold cycle that is generally less than about 10 minutes, preferably less than about 5 minutes from the time the cure of the resin is initiated.

The tertiary amines may be used as primary catalysts for accelerating the reactive hydrogen isocyanate reaction or as secondary catalysts in combination with one or more of the above noted metal catalysts, e.g., the organotin catalysts. Metal catalysts, or combinations of metal catalysts, may also be employed as the accelerating agents, without the use.of amines. The catalysts for catalyzing the polyurethane forming reaction are employed in small amounts, for example, from about O.0Q1 percent to about 1 percent, based on the combined weight of the polyisocyanate and the polyester. The polyurethane forming catalyst is optional herein since the polyol and polyisocyanate may be efficiently reacted in a heated mold even in the absence of such catalysts. The free radical curing catalysts which initiate curing and initiate the co reaction of the poly acrylate and vinyl monomer include azo and peroxide curing agents.Azo and peroxide curing agents are described by, for example,Gallagher, et al. Organic Peroxides Review, Plastics Design Processing, July, 1978, pages 38 42, and August, 1978, pages 60 67, inclusive. The technology disclosed in those two articles is incorporated herein by reference. The choice of the specific peroxide or azo initiators for the purpose of curing the composition of this invention is within the purview of those having skill in this art and the manner in which such peroxides and azo initiators effect a desirable cure is generally characterized in the aforementioned articles. Illustrative of a few such curing agents are 2,2 1 azo bis isobutyronitrile, dibenzoyl peroxide, lauroyl peroxide, di t butyl peroxide, diisopropyl peroxide carbonate, t butyl peroxy 2 ethylhexanoate, t butylperpivalate, 2,5 dimethylhexane 2,5 di per 2 ethylhexancate, t butyl peroc toa te, t butylperneodecanoate, t butylperbenzoate, t butylpercrotonate, t butyl perisobutyrate, di t butyl perphthalate, 1, 1 bis t butylperoxy 3,3, 5 trimethylcyclo hexane, and the like. The concentration of the curing agent can be varied within wide limits. As a representative range, the concentration can vary from about 0.25 to about 5.0 weight percent, preferably from about 0.5 to about 2.5 weight percent, and most preferably, from about 0.75 to about 2.0 weight percent, based on the weight of the poly acrylate and vinyl monomer. The thermosetting resin system of this invention contains from about 5 to about 95, preferably from about 25 to about 75, most preferably about 50 weight percent of the polyester and from about 95 to about 5, preferably from about 75 to about 25, and most preferably about 50 weight percent of the polyurethane. The fibers, which are suitable for use in this invention as reinforcing agents, have a melting point or a glass transition temperature above about 130eC. These fibers include fiberglass, carbon fibers, aromatic polyamide fibers such as aramid fibers sold by E. I. duPont de Nemours Company, Wilmington, Delaware, under the trademark of Kevlar , metal fibers, such as aluminium and steel fibers, boron fibers, and the like. The carbon fibers include those having a high toung s modulus of elasticity and high tensile strength. These carbon fibers may be produced from pitch, as described in U.S. Patents 3,976,729 4,005,183 and 4,026,788, for example. The preferred fibers are fiberglass, carbon fibers, aromatic polyamide fibers, and mixtures thereof. The fibers which are suitable for use in this invention, preferably, have a length of at least 1 4 inch, and an average length of at least 1 2 inch. Fibers with different lengths exceeding 1 4 inch may be used, provided that at least about 50 percent of the fibers have lengths greater than 1 2 inch. Preferred fiber lengths are from 1 to 2 or more inches. Continuous filaments may also be used. It is also within the scope of this invention to include the use of fiber reinforcements of shorter lengths and also fillers such as milled glass. TWe molded article contains from about 10 to about 75, preferably from about 50 to about 65 weight percent of the reinforcement fiber or from about 20 to about 40 weight percent of milled glass reinforcement. It is, furthermore, desirable to utilize a vinyl polymerization inhibitor in those cases where the poly acrylate and or polymerizable vinyl monomers are to be stored, shipped, or sold. Suitable vinyl polymerization inhibitors are hydroquinone, quinone, para benzoquinone, t butyl catechol, quinhydrone, toluhydroquinone, mono t butylhydroquinone, 2,5 di t butylhydroquinone, hydroquinone monomethyl ether, the biphenol drivatives described in U.S.P. 4,158,027, and the like. The amount of inhibitor for the purpose of preventing vinyl polymerization can be that conventionally used, namely from about 100 to about 300 ppm of the combined weight of the poly acrylate and vinyl monomer. The composition of this invention may also include other ingredients, such as mold release agents, and the like. The thermosetting resin systems of this invention are suitably molded by the RIM reaction injection molding process. In this process, two packages are prepared for subsequent rapid mixing and molding by machine. One package comprises a mixture of the polyol, optionally, the vinyl monomer and or poly acrylate , the polyurethane reaction catalyst and, optionally, a vinyl polymerization inhibitor. The other package comprises a mixture of the polyisocyanate, optionally, ethylenically unsaturated monomer and or poly acrylate , the free radical curing agent and, optionally, a vinyl polymerization inhibitor. It is understood that the ethylenically unsaturated monomer and or poly acrylate may be distributed between the two packages so as to adjust their volumes and or viscosities to desirable levels.Both packages, when properly formulated, are relatively stable such that they can be stored, shipped and or sold. At the time of use the packages are rapidly and continuously mixed and molded into the desired shapes. A preferred procedure for producing a molded article from the compositions of this invention is described in U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 135,906 entitled Molding Process and Apparatus Therefore , and filed onApril 14, 1980 in the same name of R. Angell, Jr., which is incorporated herein by reference. In this application, a process for rapidly fabricating fiber reinforced thermoset resin articles is described.The fiber reinforcement is comprised of one or. more fibers with a melting point or a transition temperature above about 130 C. The process comprises the steps of a providing one or more fibers with a melting point or a glass transition temperature above about 1300C in the form of an interlocked mass in a heatable matched metal die mold, b providing in one or more accumulator zones, a liquid body of a thermosettable organic material having a viscosity determined at 120 C, in the absence of curing agent therefore, of less than about 50 centipoise, and which is curable upon heating to a thermoset resin composition, the viscosity of said liquid body being maintained essentially constant in the accumulator zone by keeping its temperature below that at which curing of said material is substantial, c closing the mold containing the web, d injecting at least a portion of said thermosettable organic material under pressure from said accumulator zone s into the mold to thereby fill the cavity in said mold, e initiating the curing of said material in said mold by subjecting the material to a temperature above the temperature at which the curing of said material is initiated, by heating the mold, and f opening said mold and removing the cured thermoset article therefrom. In said U.S. Patent Application Serial No.135,906 the apparatus comprises a a heatable matched die mold containing one or more cavities therein with means for opening said mold to expose such cavities, and closing the same, and means for controlling the injection of a thermosettable organic liquid to such cavities when the mold is closed, b means associated with said mold, whereby one or more fibers in the form of an interlocked mass are provided in a portion of the cavities thereof when the mold is open to expose such cavities and prior to the injection of the thermosettable organic liquid to such cavities when the mold is closed, c accumulator means associated with said mold which can contain a thermosettable liquid transportable to means for controlling injection of said liquid to such cavities, d cooling means associated with the means for controlling the injection of such liquid to such cavities, whereby the temperature of the liquid in such injection means is maintained substantially below the temperature of the mold. In the instant process, it is desirable to effect rapid mixing of the two reactive streams just prior to their entry into the mold. This can be accomplished by inserting an impingement mixing head or a static mixer in the nozzle andusing two accumulator zones. In this configuration the polyol and the polyisocyanate component can be kept separate until parts are fabricated.The vinyl monomer and poly acrylate may be stored in either or both accumulator zones. The thermosetting polyester polyurethane resin composition is injected into a mold, the temperature of which varies from room temperature to 2000 C. The choice of mold temperature is influenced by the free radical initiator. Typically, the mold temperature is between 100 and 170 C. Due to the low viscosities of the compositions of this invention, they readily flow through and about and within the total confines of the mold and the fibrous material contained therein to effect a uniform distribution of the reaction product within the ultimate molded product. In another embodiment of this invention, the reinforcement or filler, in particular, milled glass or short fiber reinforcements, may be included as part of the resin packages and injected in the mold along with the resin. Such reinforcements or fillers may be added to the package containing the polyol or, in some cases, the package containing the polyisocyanate, or both. The following Examples serve to give specific illustration of the practice of this invention but they are not intended in any way to act to limit the scope of this invention. The follodpg designations used in the Examples have the following meaning Polyol I EMI19.1 wherein a b c 2.9 having a molecular weight of about 260 and a viscosity of 880 centipoise at 25 C.

Six to eight plies 180 grams of PPG typeAKM glass mat sold by PPG Industries, Pittsburgh, Pa. with dimensions of 10 X 10 inches were placed in a pressure bag mold. The pressure bag mold is situated between a heated top and bottom platen. The female mold cavity on top of the bottom platen had inner dimensions of 10 X 10 inches and contained a nitrogen inlet. Between the female mold cavity and top platen were the following a layer of aluminum foil partially depressed to fit into the mold a 10 X 10 inch chrome plate, a second layer of aluminum foil partially depressed to fit into the mold, a third layer of aluminum foil, a 12 X 12 inch chrome plate, and a rubber pad. The bottom aluminum foil, the 10 X 10 inch chrome plate and second layer of aluminum foil were placed in the mold cavity together with a 1 8 X 10 X 10 inch aluminum plate to simulate the finished plaque.The mold was closed to preform or depress the aluminum foils. The press was opened and the aluminum plate removed. The second and third sheets of aluminum foil were coated with a thin film of mold release agent. The preformed space was filled with the glass mat. The resin mixture was poured over the glass mat as evenly as possible. The top or third aluminum foil, 12 X 12 inch chrome plate, and rubber pad were put in place and the press was closed and pressured to about 40 tons. The mold cavity was pressured with nitrogen to the desired pressure of about 150 to about 250 psi. The mold temperature was 1300 C. The resin was cured in about 10 minutes. The pressure was released, the press opened and the plaque removed. The plaque was tested to determine Heat Distortion Temperature, Notched Izod Impact, Tensile Strength,Tensile Modulus, Elongation at Break, Flexural Strength and Flexural Modulus. The weight percent glass in the plaque was obtained by ashing the flexural test bars. The results are shown in Table I. Examples 2 and 3 The resin mixture proportions of Example 1 were used to mold and test a plaque according to the procedure described in Example 1. The amount of glass added to the mold in each of these Examples was varied as shown in Table I. The total weight of resin and glass was held constant at 360g. The results are shown in Table I.
