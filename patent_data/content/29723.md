# Process for the production of ethanol and or acetaldehyde in the presence of metal complex catalyst systems.

## Abstract
Ethanol and or acetaldehyde are produced by reacting at elevated temperature and pressure methanol with synth esis gas in the presence of a catalyst comprising a metal complex in which the metal is a metal of Group VIII of the Periodic Table other than iron, palladium and platinum and the ligand is derived from cyclopentadiene or a substituted cyclopentadiene and a promoter which is an iodide or a bromide. Optionally there is also added as a co promoter a compound of formula X A B C wherein X is nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony or bismuth and A, B and C are individually C₁ to C₂₀ monovalent hydrocarbyl groups which are free from aliphatic carbon carbon unsaturation and are bound to the X atom by a carbon X bond, or X is phosphorus, arsenic, antimony or bismuth and any two of A, B and C together form an organic divalent cyclic ring system bonded to the X atom, or X is nitrogen and all of A, B and C together form an organic trivalent cyclic ring system bonded to the X atom, e.g. triphenylphosphine.
