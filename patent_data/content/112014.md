# Apparatus for reading bar codes.

## Abstract
There is disclosed an apparatus and method for reading bar codes in which a linear array of sensing devices 44 is positioned adjacent a moving document 58 on which is located a plurality of dot matrix printed coded bars 54 . Each of the sensing devices 44 is positioned so as to sense one of the matrix dots 56 which form the coded bar 54 and output an analog signal whose signal level varies directly in accordance with the ink intensity of the sensed dot 56 . Signals are then amplified, filtered and converted into binary signals having either a high or a low level depending on whether or not the analog signals exceed a predetermined threshold value. The binary signals are then examined and, if a predetermined number of high level binary signals are produced and if there is not more than one location in the array of sensing devices 44 in which two devices generat ing a high level signal is separated by a device generating a low level signal, then a control signal is produced indicating a valid bar. These signals are then used in decoding the bars 54 sensed. This arrangement reliably detects the presence of a dot matrix printed bar on a document 58 and avoids false sensing of a bar where only ink splatter and smudges are present.
