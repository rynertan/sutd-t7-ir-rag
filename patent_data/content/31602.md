# Airplane main landing gear assembly.

## Abstract
A main landing gear assembly for an airplane includes a set of landing wheels 21 to 24 journalled to a shock absorber strut 20 . The shock strut and wheels are swingably attached to the wing structure 10 by a pair of trunnion bearings 63, 64 for lateral swinging movement between an extended position wherein the wheels depend downwardly from the wing for taxiing or landing of the airplane and a retracted position wherein the wheels and shock strut are swung inwardly and upwardly into a wheel bay 14 in the airplane fuselage. The shock strut is braced in the extended position by a foldable drag strut 80 and a foldable side strut 100 , each strut attached at an intermediate position on the shock strut. The foldable struts and the trunnion bearings provide a four point support configuration which allows a net reduction in aircraft weight due to improved distribution of drag and static loads into the wing body structure.
