# Wide band tape recorder interface for recording digital image data in real time.

## Abstract
A wide band tape recorder is interfaced with a digital image processing system, processing frames of digital information made up of arrays of pixels, each pixel represented by a digital word with the digital words representative of the pixels available on a bus in which each line of the array is presented in serial order from top to the bottom of the frame with a memory for storing desired header information which is to be provided with each frame of information, a buffer which is used to buffer incoming data from the bus, and output circuits which as inputs the output of the to buffer, and adapted to insert the header information contained in the memory at the beginning of each frame of information which is coupled to said tape recorder.
