# ADDITIVES FOR USE IN CELL CULTURE, CULTURE MEDIUM FOR NON SERUM CULTIVATION AND METHOD OF CELL CULTURE USING THEM

## Abstract
Additives for use in cell culture comprise ovomacro globulin obtainable from egg white protein. The additives are incorporated into culture mediums as a subsituent to serum, which has been normally added to conventional nutrition mediums in the field of cell culture, thus establish a non serum cultivation. The ovomacroglobulin desirably promotes the propagating property of cultivated cells and facilitate the isolation of aimed substances produced by the cultured cells.
