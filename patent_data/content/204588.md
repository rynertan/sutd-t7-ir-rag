# DIGITAL TIMER

## Abstract
A digital timer for use in a microprocessor comprising an N bit counter 2 having a clock input for receiving clock pulses and for counting in response thereto and for produc ing a first signal UNFA in response to the counter reaching a first predetermined count an M bit counter 8 having a clock input for receiving clock pulses and for counting in response thereto bistable means 4 having a SET input coupled to receive the first signal of the N bit counter, a RESET input and an output an AND gate 6 having a first input coupled to the output of the bistable means, a second input coupled to the clock input of the N bit counter and an output coupled to the clock input of the M bit counter and to the RESET input of the bistable means and means 16 coupled to receive the first signal of the N bit counter and for producing a second signal in response to the M bit counter having a second predetermined count when the first signal is produced, whereby the second signal is indicative of an M N bit count being reached.
