# Tool position and identification system for steam generator servicing machine.

## Abstract
The identity of a cantilevered end effector support member 33 and its angular position on the platform member 29 of a carriage 27 movable along an arm 23 which is rotatable in a plane parallel to a steam generator tubesheet 9 , are supplied to a tubesheet servicing machine control system in the form of a discrete pattern of electrical signals which is used to determine the offset required in aligning the end effector 35 with a particular point on the tubesheet. The discrete pattern of electrical signals is generated by at least two sensor elements 59 mounted on one of the members, preferably at different radial distances from the pivot axis of the support member. At least two trigger elements 61 are mounted on the other member in such a pattern as to trigger selected sensor elements to produce the discrete pattern of signals. By increasing the number of sensors and trigger elements, it is possible to provide binary information indicating tool presence, tool identification as well as toll angular position.
