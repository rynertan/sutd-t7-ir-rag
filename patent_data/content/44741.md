# A patient treating mattress.

## Abstract
A disposable or reusable crawl resistant flexible mattress 3 formed of panels 20,21 sealed together to define alternately inflatable passages 13,14 between the panels for sequentially altering supporting structure for a long term bed patient to reduce decubitus ulcers, bed sores, etc. The mattress has vent holes 24,25 in its top for ventilating the patient with inflation gas and a crawl resistant layer 22 bonded to the bottom panel 21 of the mattress to prevent the mattress from crawling relative to the bed and patient during use. In one form of the mattress, crawling is reduced by a separation between the inflation passages so individual sections of the mattress can more readily conform to a patient s body contour.
