# A method and apparatus for the production of wiring looms.

## Abstract
In the method, lengths of wire 9 are drawn from wire supplies 10 and cut, each end of each cut wire being stripped of insulation and terminated, and the cut wire then being laid along a predetermined path defined by guide pins 4a on a loom board 3 . The wire lengths are then bound together and removed from the board. The wire 9 is handled by a mechanical gripper 7 which moves and is actuated under preprogrammed electronic control. The apparatus comprises a loom board 3 or the means by which such a loom board can be made, an auto matic manipulator having a controlled gripper 7 to draw wire 9 from a preselected supply 10 , a cutter 8 to cut the wire, a wire stripper and insulative sleeve applica tor 16 and a terminal supply and crimper 17 , both accessible to the gripper which can then lay the terminated wire lengths along predetermined paths on the loom board 3 , and a tape binder 25 which binds the laid wires together to form the required wiring loom 27 .
