# FLAT PANEL LIQUID CRYSTAL DISPLAY

## Abstract
A flat panel liquid crystal display for use in providing single or multi colour display images. The display comprises one or more ultraviolet light sources not shown , a light pipe assembly which includes a plurality of liquid crystal cells 77, 78 that may be addressed via an array of transparent row and column electrodes 14, 16 , and a viewing screen 9 having a plurality of phosphor elements 12, 98, 99 that are located in close proximity and in registry with respective liquid crystal cells 77, 78 . Those phosphor elements 98 and only those phosphor elements that are associated with liquid crystal cells 78 that are in their scattering states are illuminated to form the image to be displayed.
