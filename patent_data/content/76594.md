# Nitrile dicarboxylic acid anhydride polymers heat stabilised with boron compounds.

## Abstract
The tendency to crosslink of polymer compositions comprising polymer units derived from unsaturated nitriles and unsaturated dicarboxylic acid anhydrides, for example acrylonitrile and maleic anhydride, is controlled by the use of boron compounds selected from boron oxide, boron acids and esters of boron acids
