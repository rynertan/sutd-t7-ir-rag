# SYNTHESIS OF A PYRIDINE 1 OXIDE HERBICIDE AND INTERMEDIATES THEREFOR

## Abstract
Hydrogen chloride is passed into p xylene and acetal dehyde to form bis 1 chloroethyl ether the latter is con verted to 2 1 chloroethyl 1,4 dimethylbenzene by the ac tion of sulfuric acid and hydrogen chloride. Alkali metal hydrogen sulfide in aqueous methanol or ethanol converts the 2 1 chloroethyl 1,4 dimethylbenzene to alpha,2,5 trimethylbenzenemethanethiol the sodium salt of the latter reacted with 2 chloropyridine 1 oxide yields 2 1 2,5 dimethylphenyl ethylthio pyridine 1 oxide which is then oxi dized with hydrogen peroxide and alkali metal tungstate or tungstic acid to form 2 1 2,5 dimethylphenyl ethyl sulfonyl pyridine 1 oxide. The latter is useful as a herbicide.
