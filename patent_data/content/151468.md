# Signal storage system.

## Abstract
An analog signal is stored in an analog memory device 2 , while lower bits of a digital signal obtained by digitizing the analog signal is stored in a digital memory device 4 . An analog signal reproduced from the analog memory device 2 is corrected on the basis of a digital signal reproduced from the digital memory device 4 . The corrected repro duced signal is stored in the memory device again, whereby a recursive storage system is constructed. A minute signal component degraded by noise in the analog storage is corrected with the digital signal, with the result that storage and reproduction of favorable signal to noise ratio are realized.
