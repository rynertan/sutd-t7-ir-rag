## Description
Dhe present invention relates to a modular case for video cassettes and the like. As it is known,thereare presently amicable on the market several types or cases, or containers, ror videocassettes and the like which,ix the most simple embodiment, consist or substantially box like structures. That form of packaging usually presents the drawback that it does not afford the possibility of orderly and firmly arranging the video cassettes, thereby the latter may be hardly selectea for use. Accordingly, the task of the present invention is to overcome the thereinabove mentionea drawback by providing a modular case specifically designed for video cassettes, which is effective to orderly house the cassettes, while a tording the possibility or easily and quickly selecting the cassette to be used without disturbing the ordered arrangement or the remaining videocassettes. Within that task, it is a primary object or the present invention to provide such a modular case the structure thereof is a very simple one and tiich iny be easily used. Another object of the present invention is to provide such a modular case which is effective to safely protect the contained videocassettes, and prevent said cassettes fron being displaced. According o one aspect of the present invention the thereinabove mentioned task and objects, as well as yet other objects which will become snore apparent hereinafter, are achieved by a modular case for videocassettes and the like, characterized in that it comprises a substantially flattened configuration box like body, having an open side and coupling male and remale elements on the greater surfaces whereof for coupling adjoining box like bodies, a closure element effective to be coupled to said box like body and having a back effective to be coupled to said open side and proviaea with a bracket portion perpenaicularly extending from said back portion, said bracket portion being provided with side edges joining witn corresponding cages as provided on the inner race of said back portion ana ending at the top with enlarged ears, said bracket portion, said side edges, said corresponding edges and said ears being effective to be engaged with periphericzl portions of a viedeocassette and the like to be supported thereby. Further characteristics and advantages will become more apparesr hereinafter from the following detailed description of a modular case for videocassettes and the like, being illustrated, by way of an indicative but not limitative example, in the accompanying drawings, where fig.1 is an exploded partially broken away view illustrating a modular case or container according to the present invention fig.2 is a middle cross section view illustrating the closure element associated with the case according to the present invention fig.3 scflematically illustrates an adjoining and piling up coupling of a plurality of modular cases and fig. 4 is a cross sectional view taken substantially along the line IV IV of fig. 2. With reference to the mentioned figures, the modular case or container for video cassettes and the like, according to the present invention, comprises a box like body, indicated overally by the reference number which is preferably provided with a flattened configuration and is made irom a plastics mareriil. aid box like body is provided with an open greater side for accessing the case inside. At the opposite greater sides there or, indicated at 3, the box like body 1 is provided with male and female coupling elements, preferably conslsting of dovetail lugs 4 QEa recesses 5, which are so arrangea as to allow for adjoining box like bodies to be firmly coupled to one another by z rived joint type of coupling. According to a preferred, though not binding, embodiment, each side is provided with a male coupling element and a female coupling element, which are parallel arranged at a predetermined distance from one another. A closure element 6 may be movably coupled to the box like boay 1, which closure element is provided with z back portion 9 effective to be coupled at said open side 2. From said back portion a bracket portion 7 extends at the bottoi,tiichbracke portion 7 is perpendicularly arranged to said back portion and is effective to DC introduced inside the case. The bracket portion 7 is laterally contained by side edges 8 which are joined to corresponding side edge or rims 10 longitudinally formed on the inner face or the back portion O. The side edges 10 are terminated at the top Dy enlarged ears 10a which are advantageously converging with respect to one another. The bracket portion 7,the side edges d, the corresponding edges or rims 10 as well as said enlarged ears 10a are effective to engage with at least a peripherical portion or a videocassette for introducing the latter inside the box like body l it should also be noted that the size of the portion ol the closure element O which is introduced into the case are so designed as to obtain a comparatively precise fixed joint type or coupling. in order to favour the gripping of said back portion 9,on a portion or the latter there are provided spaced recesses 11 which are practically effective to define a gripping element. In order to allow ror a stable coupling to be obtained between the closure or cover element 6 and said box like body, on the side zones ol the rims 10 there are roomed semispherical portions 12 effective to snap engage with correspond ing notches 13 as formed on the inner surrace of said box like body 1. nie lugs 12 may exit the notches 13 due to the elastic deformability of the materials forming both said box like body 1 and the closure element 6. The box like bodies 1,in addition to being couplable to one another as it has been illustrated thereinabovesmay also be mutually stacked, thereby, at the top race adjacent to said open face 2 there are provided centering lugs 14 longitudinally extending on said race and erfective to be coupled to corresponding centering recesses formed at the lower face of said box like body 1. in order to house on the closure element 6 videocassettes or different sizes, the side ears loa which it has been said, are converging,are provided with undercuts 20 effective to receive the upper corner of a videocassette,wiile preventing said videocsssette from undesirably moving in the inside of the element itself. in order to facilitate the engaging of videocassettes of different size, at the side edges d or the mentioned bracket portion 7 there are provided two recess pairs 21 and 22 which are located adjoining one another and are effective to receive,by a fixed joint type of coupling,a movable wall 23 perpendicularly extending with respect both to the bracket portion 7 and the side edges b. The small wall 23 is inserted either into one or the other recess pairs 21 or 22 depending on the contingent size or the videocasset te. Prom the above disclosure it should be noted that the invention fully achieves the intended objects more specifically the ract is to be pointed out that a modular case is provided which affords the possibility of orderly preserving the videocassettas, by adoiing and coupling to one another the several box like bodies, iiile affording the possibility of easily selecting the videocassettes to be used, without disturbing in any ways the proper arrangement of the remaining videocassettes. In practicing the invention, the used materials, as well the size and contingent shapes may be ny,according to the needs.
