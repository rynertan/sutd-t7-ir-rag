# Method for selective methylation of erythromycin a derivatives.

## Abstract
A method for the selective methylation of the hydroxy group at the 6 position of erythromycin A derivatives which comprises reacting a compound represented by the formula R X wherein R is a 2 alkenyl group, a benzyl group or a sub stituted benzyl group, and X is a halogen atom , reacting the resulting quaternary salt compound with a methylating agent, and then eliminating R groups of the resulting compound to give 6 O methylerythromycin A 9 oxime, is disclosed.
