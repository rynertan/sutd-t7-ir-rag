## Description
PROCESS FOR PRODUCING AN INSULIN With the advent of the possibility to generate protein products by recombinant DNA methods and specifically the production of insulin A chain and insulin B chain by such techniques see Goeddel et al.,Proc. Nat l. Acad. Sci. USA 76, 106 110 1979 1, the need for an efficient method for combining the A andB chains to form insulin has greatly increased. Typically, the prior art methods for producing insulin by combination of A and B chains use as starting materials such A and B chains in the form of their stable S sulfonates. In general, he A andB chain S sulfonates, either separately or together, are reduced to their corresponding SH compounds, customarily using a large excess of thiol reducing agent. The products are isolated from the reducing medium and, if not reduced together, are brought together in an oxidizing medium, e.g., air, to achieve combination of A and B chains with production of insulin. Examples of this methodology are found in Du et al., Sclentia Silica 10, 84 104 1961 Wilson et al., Biochim.Biophys. Acta 62, 483 489 1962 Du et al., Scientia Sinica 14, 229 236 1965 Kung et al.,Scientia Sinica 15, 544 561 1966 Xexue Tongbao Republic of China 17, 241 277 1965 and Markussen, J. Acta Paediatrica Scandinavioa, Suppl. 270, 121 126 1977 . A modification of this approach involves reduction of the A chain S sulfonate followed by reaction of the reduced A chain with B chain S sulfonate in an oxidizing atmosphere. See, e.g., Katsoyannis et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 55, 1554 1561 1966 Katsoyannis, Science 154, 1509 1514, 1966 Katsoyannis et al., Biochemistry 6, 2642 2655 1967 U.S. Patent No. 3,420,810 and Jentsch, Journal ofChromatography 76, 167 174 1973 . Another modification involves partial oxidation of the A chain SH compound to produce disulfide formation between the A 6 and A ll cysteine residues followed by oxidation of the product with B chain SH or B chainS sulfonate. See, e.g., Belgian Patent No. 676,069 andZahn et al., Liebigs Ann. Chem. 691, 225 231, 1966 . In each of the above prior art methods, one element is common i.e., the production of insulin by two independent, sequential steps, namely, reduction ofS sulfonate to SH followed by oxidation to S S . Dixon et al., Nature 188, 721 724 1960 describe conditions which suggest single solution conversion of A and B chain S sulfonates to insulin using a thiol reducing agent and air oxidation. The details are quite sketchy, and the yield, based only cn activity of product recovered, represented 1 2 . However, Dixon, in Proc. Intern. Conger. Endecrinol. 2ndLondon 1964, 1207 1215 1965 , in somewhat further elaboration, suggests, in Table IV at page 1211, that the conditions reported in the earlier publication involve separate reduction and oxidation steps. In distinction to the above prior art methods, it has now been discovered that it is possible under defined reaction conditions to achieve attractive levels of production of insulins or analogs of insulins from S sulfonated A and B chains by conducting both the reduction and oxidation reactions in a single step, single solution process. It is to such a process that this invention is directed. Therefore, this invention is directed to a process for combining an A chain of an insulin or insulin analog and a B chain of an insulin or an insulin analog to produce an insulin or an insulin analog, which comprises reacting the S sulfonated form of theA chain, the S sulfonated form of the B chain, and a thiol reducing agent together in an aqueous medium under conditions which produce a mixture having 1 a pH of from about 8 to about 12, 2 a total protein concentration of from about 0.1 to about 50 milligrams per milliliter, and 3 an amount of thiol reducing agent which affords a total of from about 0.4 to about 2.5 SH groups per each SSO3 group present in the total amount of A and B chain S sulfonates and allowing formation of insulin or an insulin analog to occur by maintaining the mixture at a temperature of from about OOC. to about 250C. and in an environment which provides a source of oxygen. This invention is directed to an efficient, single step, single solution process for producing insulin or an analog of insulin from its constituent S sulzonated A and B chains. By the term insulin is meant, of course, any of the naturally occurring insulins, such as human, bovine, porcine, sheep, fish, avian, and the like, as well as a hybrid formed from a combination of anA chain of one species and a B chain of another. By the ter insulin analog is meant any of a wide variety of proteins, each of which has the basicA chain and B chain containing all of the half cystine residues in a sequential alignment consistent with that of the natural insulins. The analogs differ from natural insulins by substitution, addition, deletion, or modification of one or more amino acid resides, but with retention of the disulfide bond arrangement and at least a portion of the insulin like activity.Examples of such analogs are. N formyl Gly A insulin, Desamino A1 insulin, Sarcosine1 A insulin, L Alaninel A insulin, D Alanine1 A insulin, Isoasparagine21 A insulin, D Asparagine21 A insulin, Arginine21 A insulin, Asparagineamide A insulin, Sarcosine1 A, Asparagine21 A insulin, Norleucine2 A insulin, Threonine 5 A insulin, Leucine5 A insulin, Phenylalanine19 A insulin, D Tyrosine19 A insulin, Tyrosine18 A, Asparagine19A, 21 28 30 Arginine21 A insulin, Des B28 30 tripeptide insulin,Des B27 30 tetrapeptide insulin, Des B26 30 pentapeptide insulin, Des B27 30 tetrapeptide, Tyrosinamid26 B insulin, Des B 30 pentapeptide, Phenylalaninamide 25 B insulin, Des B1 4 tetrapeptide insulin, Des B1 5 9 pentapeptide insulin, Lysine B insulin, Leucine9 B insulin, Leucine10 B insulin, Des Phenylalanine1 B insulin, and the like. These and other are described in the literature see, for example, Blundell, T., et al, Advances in Protein Chemistry, 26, 330 362,Academic Press, N.Y., N.Y. 1972 Katsoyannis, P.G.,Treatment of Early Diabetes, 319 327, Plenum PublishingCorp. 1979 Geiger, R., Chemiker Zeitung, Reprint 100, 111 129, Dr. A. Huthig, Publisher, Heidelberg, W.Germany 1976 Brandenburg, D. et al., Biochem. J.125, 51 52 1971 . Although the process of this invention is broadly applicable to the production of insulins and insulin analogs, it is highly preferred to use it in te production of naturally occurrirg insulins, in particular, human, bovine, or porcine insulins, and most particularly, human insulin. In carrying out the process of this invention, the combination of A and B chain to form insulin or an insulin analog can be achieved over a wide range cf ratios of one chain relative to the other. The com bination, of course, is inherently limited by the chain, whether A or B, present in the lesser quantity. In any event, although not essential, the customary ratio of A chain to B chain, on a weight basis, is from about 0.1 1 to about 10 1. It is highly preferred to carry out the process of this invention using a weight ratio of A chain to B chain in the range from about 1 1 to about 3 1. It has also been discovered, within this preferred range, that certain ranges are especially advantageous for production of a particular species of insulin. Thus, in the combination of A and B chain to produce bovine insulin, it is preferred that the ratio of A chain to B chain be within the range of from about 1.4 1.0 to about 1.8 1.0. As to porcine insulin the preferred range is from about 1.0 1.0 to about 1.4 1.0. As to human insulin, the preferred range is from about 1.8 1.0 to about 2.2 1.0. Another parameter which is significant for carrying out the process of this invention at an optimal level is the protein concentration in the reaction medium. The process can be successfully carried out over a wide range of protein concentrations.Generally, however, the protein concentration will range from about 0.1 to about 50 mg. per ml. o reaction medium. Preferably, the protein concentration will be in the range of from about 2 to about 20 mg.per ml. Again, it has been discovered, within this latter range, that the optimal protein concentration varies depending upon the species of insulin which is produced. Therefore, as to porcine insulin, it is preferred that the protein concentration range be from about 8 to about 16 mg. per ml., whereas, in the production of human or bovine insulin, the preferred range is from about 3 to about 8 mg. per ml. The process of this invention is carried out in an aqueous medium. The pli of the medium measured at room temperature generally will range from about 8 to about 12. Preferably, it will be from about 9.5 to about 11.0 and optimally will be maintained within the range cf from about 10.4 to about 10.6. The pH of the medium may be maintained in the desired range by addition of a suitable buffering agent. Typical such buffering agents are, for example, glycine, glycylglycine, carbonate, tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane, N,N bis 2 hydroxyethyl glycine, pyrophosphate, N tris hydroxymethyl methyl 3 aminopropanesulfonic acid, and other like agents which effect pH control within the aforedescribed range. The common and preferred buffering agent is glycine. The concentration of buffering agent generally ranges from about 0.001 M to about 2 M. Preferably, the concentration is from about 0.01 M to about 1 M, and, most preferably, from about 0.01 M to about 0.1 M. The A and B chains are brought together in the appropriate aqueous medium in the presence of a thiol reducing agent. By thiol reducing agent is meant a compound that contains at least one SH group and has the capacity to effect reduction of the Ssulfonate groups of the A and E chains. Although any agent having these characteristics can be employed, a much preferred thiol reducing agent is one which, in its oxidized form, has been cyclized to a highly stable compound. The thiol reducing agent is present in an amount which affords a total of from about 0.4 to about 2.5 SH groups per each SSO3 group present in the total amount of A and B chain, and, preferably, from about 0.9 to about 1.1 SH groups per each SSO3 group. Examples of typical thiol reducing agents are dithiothreitol DTT , dithioerythritol DTE , 2mercaptoethanol, methyl thioglycolate, 3 mercapto 1,2 propanediol, 3 mercaptopropionic acid, thioglycolic acid, and other such thiol compounds. Preferred thiol reducing agents are dithiothreitol and dithioerythritol, with dithiothreitol being most preferred. One of the essential conditions of the process of this invention is that it be carried out in an environment that provides a source of oxygen. This condition can be met merely by permitting the reaction mixture to be open to the air. Although a more direct contact method may be employed, such as, for example, by bubbling air or oxygen into and through the reaction medium, such is not necessary. In general, therefore, the process of this invention is carried out by preparing a mixture of theA chain S sulfonate, the B chain S sulfonate, and the thiol reducing agent at desired concentrations in an aqueous medium at a pli of from about 8 to about 12.The mixture, open to air contact, is gently agitated for a period sufficient to allow chain combination to occur, generally at least about 30 minutes. During this period of agitation, the mixture generally is maintained at a temperature of from about OOC. to about 25 C. preferably, however, the mixture is subjected to moderate cooling to maintain the temperature at the lower end of this range, generally from about 20C. to about 100C. Once the reaction period has been completed, the insulin or insulin analog product can be isolated by any of a wide variety of methods, all of which are recognized in the field of insulin technology. The most commonly employed techniques for insulin purifi cation are chromatographic techniques. These are readily applicable in recovering insulin from the process of this invention. These can include gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography. Moreover, the product can be assayed for purity and activity by recognized methods such as polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, amino acid analysis, insulin radioreceptorassay, insulin radioimmunoassay, high performance liquid chromatography HPLC , ultraviolet spectrum, dansylation, rabbit blood glucose assay, and the like. The insulins which are available from the process of this invention include hybrids comprising the insulin A chain of one species and the insulinB chain of another species. The thrust of the process of this invention is directed to a proper combining ofA and B chain S sulfonates, and the particular structure of these chains, as long as they truly represent insulin or insulin analog A and B chains, is immaterial to the process of this invention. Although an insulin analog or an insulin hybrid, i.e., an A chain of one species and a B chain of another species, can be prepared by the process of this invention, it, of course, is preferred to produce an insulin which is structurally identical to that cf a naturally occurring insulin by using an A chain S sulfonate and a B chain S sulfonate, each of which has the amino acid sequence represented by such insulin.Moreover, it is highly preferred to use the process of this invention to produce porcine, bovine, or human insulin, and most preferably, to produce human insulin. The insulin or insulin analog A and B chains, as already indicated, are available by recombinant DNA methodology. They also can be prepared from natural insulins and by classical peptide synthesis methodology, including either solution or solid phase techniques. The A and B chains are maintained in stable form as 5 sulfonates. The S sulfonate starting materials are available by oxidative sulfitolysis, a treatment by which the A and B chains are reacted with sodium sulfite in the presence of a mild oxidizing agent, such as sodium tetrathionate. As illustrative of the process of this invention, the following examples are provided. These examples are provided for illustrative purposes only, and they are not intended to be limiting upon the scope of this invention.

The resulting solution was stirred at 4 80C. in an open 3 ml. vial for 20 hours. HPLC analysis of the mixture indicated a porcine insulin yield of 3.81 mg., or 35 of the total protein. Example 4 Human pancreatic B chain S sulfonate and several human pancreatic and E. coli and porcine pancreatic A chain S sulfonate solutions having 2 concentration of 5 mg. ml. in 0.1 M glycine buffer pH 10.5 were prepared.

The solution was stirred an additional 24 hours in the chill room 4 80C. . HPLC analysis at this time indicated a human insulin yield of 148 mg., or 30 of the total protein. To 100 ml. of this solution were added 25 ml.of glacial acetic acid to a final pH of 3.15. The entire sample was gel filtered on a 5 x 200 cm. column of Sephadex G 50 Superfine equilibrated and eluted with 1 M acetic acid at 4 80C. All of the eluted protein was lyophilized. The insulin peak elution volume 2465 2781 ml. weighed 125 mg. and represented 29.4 of the recovered protein. A portion of the above insulin peak 95.5 m. was dissolved in about 9 ml. of 0.01 M tris 0.001 M EDTA 7.5 M urea 0.03 M NaCl buffer pH 8.5 at 40C. .The mixture was chromatographed through a 2.5 x 90 cm.DEAE diethylaminoethyl cellulose ion exchange column equilibrated in the same buffer. The protein was eluted at 4 80C. with a gradient of 1 liter each of 0.03 X and 0.09 M NaC1 in the same buffer followed by 1 liter of buffer containing 1 M NaCl. Each of the peaks was exalted on Sephadex G 25 course columns in 2E acetic acid and lyophilized. The insulin peak elution volume 878 1008 ml. weighed 55.73 mg. and represented 84 of the protein recovered. Zinc insulin crystals were made by dissolving 11.90 mg. of the insulin DEAE peak sample in 240 Nil. of 0.1 N HC1 followed quickly by 2.16 ml. of a 0.04 ZnC12 0.0s M sodium citrate 152 acetone solution in a glass centrifuge tube. Crystallization proceeded for 72 hours at room temperature 250C. after which the supernatant was removed, and the crystals were washed twice with cold pH 6.1 water with centrifugation at 2000 rpm at 30C. between washes. The crystals were redissolved in 0.01 N HC1 for analysis. The resulting human insulin preparation was judged to be quite pure by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis a single band , amino acid analysis, insulin radioreceptorassay, insulin radioimmunoassay, HPLC, dansylation and UV spectrum. The CSP rabbit assay 144 rabbits gave a potency of 26.3 1.8 units per mg. anhydrous Example 7 Human E. coli N formyl Gly1 A chainS sulfonate and human pancreatic B chain S sulfonate solutions having a concentration of 5 mg. ml. in 0.1 X glycine buffer pH 10.5 were prepared.
