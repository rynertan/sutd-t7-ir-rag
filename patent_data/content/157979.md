# CLIP TYPE ELECTRODE FOR ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHS

## Abstract
A clip type electrode for an electrocardiograph includes a pair of clamping plates 12, 13 for being opened and closed relative to each other about a common shaft 11 and having concave surfaces 16, 17 facing each other, an electrode member 19 mounted on one of the clamping plates 12 , and a leaf spring 18 bent into a U shaped configuration for biasing ends of the clamping plates 12, 13 remote from the common shaft 11 towards each other. Each of the pair of clamping plates 12, 13 has a slot 37, 38 at a position ad jacent to the shaft 11 for accommodating the leaf spring 18 passed therethrough, and a plurality of grooves 41, 42, 43, 41 , 42 , 43 formed in an outer surface 16a, 17a thereof and spaced at successively greater distances from the shaft 11 . One end of the leaf spring 18 is fitted into a one of the plurality of grooves 41, 42, 43 in one of the clamping plates 12 , and the other end of the leaf spring 18 is fitted into one of the plurality of grooves 41 , 42 , 43 in the other 13 of the clamping plates, the grooves being chosen based upon the thickness of a limb, such as the wrist or ankle of a human body, that is to have the clip type electrode attached thereto. The limb can thus be clamped with a prescribed clamping force irrespective of the thickness of the limb.
