# Actuation of valves of internal combustion engines and conversion kit for adapting an internal combustion engine to such a valve actuation.

## Abstract
The invention provides an inexpensive and simple mechanical spring system which automatically compensates for variations in the clearance gap in the valve actuating mechanism of internal combustion engines, whereby consid erably to lengthen the time an engine can be in operation before manual adjustment of the clearance gap becomes necessary. The system comprises at least one tin metal disc 20 located between a convex surface 21a in contact with the centre of one face of the disc 20 and an annular surface 22a in contact with the periphery of the other face of the disc 20 , movement of the surfaces 21a, 22a together deforming the disc 20 around the convex surface 21a to produce a spring force which increases at a variable rate until it exceeds the valve spring 14 loading and the valve 12 opens. The mechanism is initially adjusted so that the spring deflection is approximately one half the deflection required to overcome the valve spring loading.
