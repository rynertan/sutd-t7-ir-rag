Generally, melt polymerization temperatures between about 200 to 400 C. and preferably 230 to 300 C. Can be employed.The conditions of the reaction and the proportions of in gredients can be varied widely depending on the desired molecular weight, intrinsic viscosity, and solvent resistance. In general, equimolar amounts of diamine and dianhydride are employed for high molecular weight poly etherimides, however, in certain instances, a slight molar excess about 1 to 5 mol percent ot diamine can be employed resulting in the production of polyetherimides having terminal amine groups. Monofunctional organic amines such as aniline, or organic anhydrides such as phthalic anhydride and maleic anhydride provide molecular weight control.

Included among the many methods of making the polyetherimides are those disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. Heath et al, 3,847,867, Williams 3,847,869, Takekoshi et al, 3,550,385, White 3,852,242 and 3,855,178, etc. These disolesures are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference for the purpose of teaching, by way of illustration, general and specific methods for preparing polyetherimides suitable for the blends of this invention. In accordance with the present invention, blends of the polyetherimides are generally obtainable in all proportions of the polyetherimides relative to each other.Consequently, blends comprising from about 1 to about 99 , by weight of one polyetherimide and from about 99 to about 1 , by weight of another polyetherimide are included within.the scope of the invention as well as blends of three or more different polyetherimides containing at least about 11 by weight of each of the contained polyetherimides By controlling the proportions of the various polyetherimides relative to each other, blends having certain predetermined properties which are improved over those of one or more components of the blend alone may be readily obtained. In general, blends of polyetherimides have a good appearance and exhibit a high glass transition temperature such as from 125 to 210 C. It is contemplated that the polyetherimide blends of the present invention may also include additive materials such as fillers, stabilizers, plasticitzers, flexibilizers, surfactant agents, pigments, dyes, reinforcements, flame retardants and diluents in conventional amounts. Methods for forming polyetherimide blends may vary considerably. Prior art blending techniques are generally satisfactory. A preferred method comprises blending the polymers and additives such as reinforcements in powder, granular or filamentous form1 extruding the blend, and chopping the extrudate into pellets suitable for molding by means conventionally used to mold normally solid thermo plastic compositions. The polyetherimide blends of the present invention have applLcation in a wide variety of physical shapes and forms, including the use as films, molding compounds, coat ings, etc. When used as films or when made into molded pro ducts, these blends, including laminated products prepared therefrom, not only possess good physical properties at room temperature but they retain their strength and excellent response to workloading at elevated temperatures for long periods of time. Films formed from the blends of this invention may be used in application where films have been used previously.Thus, the blends of the present invention can be used in automobile and aviation applications for decorative and protective purposes, and as high temperature electrical insulation for motor slot liners, transformers, dielectric capacitors, cable and coil wrappings form wound coil insulation for motors , and for containers and containers linings. The blends can also be used in laminated structures where films or solutions of the blend are applied to various heat resistant or other type of materials such as asbestos, mica, glass fiber and the like, the sheets superimposed one upon the other, and thereafter subjecting th. sheets to elevated temperatures and pressures to effect flow and cure of the resinous binder to yield cohesive laminated structures.Films made from the subject pobyetherimide blends can also serve in printed circuit applications, Alternatively, solutions of the blends herein described can be coated on electrical conductors such as copper, aluminum, etc. and thereafter the coated conductor can be heated at elevated temperatures to remove the solvent and provide a continuous resinous composition thereon.If desired, an additional overcoat may be applied to such insulated conductors including the use of polymeric coatings, such as polyamides, polyesters, silicones, polyvinylformal resins, epoxy resins, polyimides, polytetrafluoroethylene, etc. The use of the blends of the present invention as overcoats on other tyoes of insulation is not precluded. Other applications which are contemplated for these blands include their use as binders for asbestos fibers, carton fibers, and other fibrous materials in making brake linings. In addition, molding compositions and molded articles may be formed from the polymeric blends of the invention by incorporating such fillers as asbestos, glass fibers, talc, clay, quartz powder, finely divided carbon, and metals, silica and the like into the blends prior to molding. Shaped articles may be molded under heat, or under heat and pressure, in accordance with practices wellknown in the art.

The glass transition temperature of the blend film was measured and is given in Table I. The above blending procedure was then repeated so as to produce six additional blends having varying amounts of the first polyetherimide relative to the second polyether imide. The glass transition temperature for each of the additional blends is also set forth in Table I. From the data, it can be observed that blends containing from 50 to 708 of the first poletherimide and 50 to 30 of the second polyetherimide have a glass transition temperature in the range of 165 to 190 C. which makes these blends particularly adaptable for automotive and appliance applications.

The blends were formed into blend films and then tested for glass transition temperature. The. polyetherimide homopolymer was prepared from the reaction product of essentially equimolar amounts of 2,2 bis 4 3,4 dicarboxy phenoxy phenyll propane dianhydride and m phenylene diamine produced at elevated temperature of about 250 to about 300 C. and under nitrogen atmosphere. A test specimen solution coated in the form of a film was tested for glass transition temperature and the results are set forth in Table III. The polyetherimide copolymer was prepared from the reaction product of essentially equimolar amounts of 2,2 bis 4 3,4 dicarboxy phenoxy phenyll propane dianhydride and a mixture of equimolar amounts of m ohenylene diamine and hexamethylene diamine. About 50 parts of the polyetherimide homopolymer were mixed in solution with about 50 parts of the polyetherimide copolymer and the polymer mixture was then solution cast to form a film. The glass transition temperature of the blend film was measured and is given in TableIII. Another polyetherimide copolymer was prepared as above except that the molar ratio of m phenylene diamine to hexamethylene diamine was about three to one. About .75 parts of the polyetherimide homopolymer were mixed in solution with about 25 parts of the polyetherimide copolymer and the polymer mixture was then solution cast to form a blend film. The glass transition temperature of the blend was measured and is given in Table III. A further polyetherimide copolymer was prepared as above with the exception that the molar ratio of m phenylene diamine to hexamethylene diamine was about one to three. About 25 parts of the polyetherimide homopolymer were mixed in solution with about 75 parts of the second polyetherimide copolymer and the polymer mixture was then solution cast to form a blend film.The glass transition temperature of the blend was measured and is given in Table III. From the data presented in Table III, it can be observed that the polyetherimide homopolymer copolymer blends have an exceptionally high glass transition temperatures even at high aliphatic amine concentrations, i.e., at high hexamethylene diamine ratios. These high glass transition temperatures give the blends utility as coatings and insulation and as compression and injection molding compounds.
