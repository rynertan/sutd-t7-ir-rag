## Description
The present invention relates to a semiconductor memory and particularly to a semiconductor multilevel memory having multiple storage levels of information per memory unit even under a low power supply voltage and cnsumes less electrical power. A semiconductor memory having a higher integration density, represented by a dynamic random access memory hereinafter abbreviated as DRAM , has been developed year after year and a memory unit of semiconductor memory hereinafter referred to as memory cell and peripheral circuits are more and more superminiaturized. However, improvement in integration density by such superminiaturization must usually be accompanied by a large stride of advancement of element process technology such as photorithogrphy and etching, etc. and therefore a certain period is usually requried for devlopment of element process technology. Meanwhile, demands for very high density semiconductor memory are increasing continuously and for example, a semiconductor memory having a large capacity and less power consumption is craved for newly developed field such as a small size office computer and the terminals thereof which have recently showed fantastic growth. Namely, an existing semiconductor memory is said not only as it is insufficient from the point of view of integration density but also in sufficient from the point of view of power consumption and other performances. In order to meet such requirements, a memory having multiple level storage structure MLS memory is considered as an effective means for realizing a semiconductor memory having a higher integration density by the current process technology. This memory is intended to substantially increase integration density by causing a single memory cell to store the data of more than two 2 levels. As an MLS memory, a charge transfer device hereinafter referred to as CTD is well known. These are explained in detail, for example, in L. Terman tal. IEEE Journal of Solid State Circuits. Vol. sc 16, No. 5, pp.472 478, October 1981. and M. Yamada et. al. Proceedings of the 9th Conference on Solid State Devices, Tokyo 1977, pp. 263 268, issued on January 1978. However, the MLS memory using CTD is not yet often put into practical use, because a number of levels cannot be increased so much in order to prevent that a multilevel data of analog signal is substantially attenuated due to finite transfer efficiency peculiar to the CTD. Or, such multilevel memory is inferior in such a point that it is necessary to raise a driving pulse voltage in order to increase the transfer efficiency and such element intrinsically has a high capacitance load and consumes a very high electrical power. Moreover, it is also inferior in such a point that a memory cell can be formed small because high precision A D, D A converters are required for loops of each CTD but integration density cannot be raised due to the restriction on the peripheral circuits. A MLS memory is also disclosed in FR A 2 246 022. The read circuit described in this document, however, is only reliable if the storage capacitor is considerably larger than the capacity of the data lines and the input capacity of the read circuit. In EP A 0 139 196 a charge transfer amplifier is described which amplifies the signal voltages on the data line with high accuracy. Further, EP A 0 130 614 discloses a MLS memory in which a multi level step voltage is applied to the plate electrode of the storage capacitor or to the gate electrode of the associated MOS FET of the memory matrix for reading and writing data of more than two voltage levels from or into the capacitor. The latter two prior art documents are not prepublished and fall under Article 54 3 EPC. The inventors of the present invention have thought that a dynamic memory DRAM for addressing by both rows and columns is caused to store the multiple level data as an MLS memory for eliminating various disadvantages of an MLS memory using CTD described above and the A D, D A converters are also provided in the sensing and writing sytems. In the case of the memory for addressing by both rows and columns, it is no longer necessary to consider the transfer efficiency, a number of gates to be driven can be decreased and thereby power consumption can also be saved. However, a very difficult problem explained below must be solved in order to use such DRAM as an MLS memory. Namely, even if multilevel data analog signal of the maximum dynamic range multilevel data can be obtained by dividing it of 5 V Here, it should be noted that a MLS memory can be used as an excellent large capacity memory when a number of memory cells which is equal to or larger than that of an ordinary 2 level memory are mounted on a chip in such a size as is equal to or smaller than that of said 2 level memory. Namely, when current signal charge of one memory cell of DRAM is Q It is an object of the present invention to realize a new memory having multiple level storage structure MLS memory for addressing by both rows and columns and thereby provide a large capacity semiconductor memory with less power consumption. In order to attain the above object, the present invention provides an MLS memory comprising a newly developed minute voltage amplifier which is just suited to a large capacity memory, a highly accurate A D, D A converting structure even with simplified configuration and low power consumption and peripheral circuit with less power consumption. Thereby, it is now possible to replace a magnetic disk unit which requires large physical occupation and electrical power with a semiconductor memory, for example, in a small size computer system.

In the following embodiment, data is carried and stored by the operations of electrons used as signal charge carriers but the holes can also be used in the same way by changing the polarity of power supply and pulses and the conductivity type of semiconductors. Fig. 1 shows a block diagram of an embodiment of an MLS memory by the present invention. In this figure, numeral 1 is unit cell hereinafter referred to as memory cell of memory. 2 is storage capacitor. 3 is switching transistor switching MOS transistor which operates as word gate. 4 is electrode of storage capacitor 2 which is usually connected to a DC power supply V and the n channel MOS transistor is indicated only by 32 is bias charge transfer amplifier hereinafter referred to as BCT amplifier which amplifies with high accuracy the signal voltages on the data line which has been divided into multilevel low voltages up to large voltages. 22 is block of array. 33 is sense amplifier. 23 is array block thereof. 34 is column register temporary storage cell . 24 is array block thereof. 35 is a triggering pulse generator. 36 is multiple level step voltage generator. 37 is control circuit which controls the sense systems 21, 22, 23. 38 is control circuit shift register for sending timing pulses to the column registers. 29 is row address select circuit. 25 is row address buffer. 26 is column adress select circuit. 27 is array block of column address select gate and input output circuit. 28 is decoder encoder circuit block of input output data. In an embodiment of an MLS memory shown in Fig. 1, A D, D A conversion means is realized a multiple level step voltage generator 36 and a shift register 38 which are controlled by a triggering pulse generator 35, a row address buffer 25 which transfers multiple level step voltage to the word line 5, a memory cell 1, a reset gate 30, writing gate 31, a column register 34, an input output circuit 27 and a decoder encoder 28. Said A D, D A conversion means is explained first hereunder. In the following explanation, a number of multiple levels is set to four levels 2 bits but in actual it is possible to select more large number of levels. Fig. 2 shows a schematic diagram for explaining the A D conversion means of multiple level memory of the present invention under the data reading operation. In the same figure, 41 is a stepping voltage pulse The multiple level data readout above is no longer analog data but the digital data. This digital data is sent to the encoder through the output lines in this example, used as the input output common line I O line refer to Fig. 4, Fig. 11, Fig. 18, Fig. 19 and is then read as the usually employed digital data such as binary code. Above A D conversion system is characterized in that after signal charge is output from memory cell, a charge packet only carries a binary digital data of ON and OFF, and multiple level data is effectively carried at the timings t₁ t₅ which are given by the pulses sent from the triggering pulse generator which control the column register and the pulse Accordingly, the A D conversion system of the present invention does not become a large scale and high power circuit which interferes realization of high integration density memory like the existing A D conversion circuit and a memory with super high integration density can be realized with less power consumption. Fig. 3 shows a schematic diagram indicating the D A conversion means of MLS memory of the present invention under the writing operation. In this figure, 51 is the stepping pulse In the writing operation a data line is set to a low level 0V in this case by the reset gate 30 t₆ t₇ . When it is required to write the second level 2 of charge storage states, the data line is raised to a high level through the write gate 31 when the pulse The write read means shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 2 have such a large characteristic that the signal charges corresponding to a level does not almost change depending on the location when the level of pulse When substrate voltage effect is low, Q Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 show respectively the practical example of circuit diagram of the column register, column address select gate Y gate and input output circuit block 27 herein after explained as a part of column register in the embodiment shown in Fig. 1 and the pulse timing chart. In Fig. 4, 61 is a shift register corresponding to a control circuit which controls a storage 38 shown in Fig. 1. This register sends the pulse Fig. 5 shows the drive pules and internal waveforms in the READ REFRESH mode of the MLS memory of the present invention. In this example, the data 2 is read and the same data is written again. First, the read gates 620 623 are precharged to a high level through the precharge gate 63 at the timing t₀. At the timing t₁ t₅, the ascending stepping pulse is applied to the word line 5 Fig. 1 , signal charge is read to the data line 6 when the level is R₂ t₃ t₄ and a voltage V₀ drops 71 . This signal is amplified by the voltage amplifier 32, judged by the sense amplifier 33 and appears on the output terminal 64 as an output voltage V Next, a voltage V The timing of level 2 output to V On the other hand, an output V During the REFRESH operation, the write enable signal A temporary storage column register providing N or N 1 storage cells corresponding to a number of levels N has eliminated, when it is installed, a large scale circuit such as encoder, decoder and logic gate exclusive OR gate and AND gate required for refresh operation from each data line and is very important component which realizes the sense system of MLS memory with such an integration density as the DRAM in the maximum integration level. This storage has attained practically the high integration density MLS memory of the present invention for the first time. In Fig. 4, the precharge gate 63 among various gates uses the p channel MOS transistor, while the other gates use the n channel MOS transistors. As is already described, it is substantially important for the MLS memory for addressing by both rows and columns to amplify with high accuracy the signal per level which has been divided into minute signals of multiple levels. In the present invention, such requirement has been attained by providing a high performance bias charge transfer amplifier shown as 32 in Fig. 1 and an MLS memory which realizes a large number of multiple levels even at a low voltage has been embodied for the first time. Fig. 6 is a sectional view of BCT amplifier bias charge transfer amplifier which amplifies a minute signal of one level appearing on the data line up to such a voltage as can be sensed by the sense amplifier 33 consisting of the MOS transistor circuits. Fig. 7 shows drive pulse timings and potentials. Fig. 8 shows pulse timings and potentials indicating other driving method. Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 show the embodiments of BCT amplifier. In Fig. 6, 80 is an insulating film 81 is an N type semiconductor substrate 82 is a P type well region 83 86 are n layers 87, 89 are charge transfer gates 88 is a charge driving gate 90 is a precharge gate 92 is a sense amplifier input terminal. Operations of BCT amplifier are explained by referring to Fig. 6 and Fig. 7. First, the reset gate 30 is set to the conductive state ON state by the reset pulse The drive pulse timing is shown in Fig. 7 A . Said bias charge transfer process is repeated for a number of times corresponding to a number of levels 9 for example, 4 times in the case of four levels for reading multiple level data reading. Namely, in the example of Fig. 2, the bias charge transferf is carried out once during the timing t₁ t₂ and the timing t₂ t₃ respectively. Such repetition may be allowed during the timing t₂₃ t₂₈ as shown in Fig. 7 A or may be allowed during the timing t₂₁ t₂₈, except for the reset time of data line. Durting the latter timing, the bias charge under the drive gate 88 is reset in each timing and therefore when reading is conducted many times, the bias charge transfer can always be done with high accuracy by preventing that the charges are reduced by a tailing current of the gate T1 89 . Here, a minute charge Q Namely, the gate T3 83 becomes cut off state, a current usually does not almost flow under the gate T3 because a voltage amplitude is very small even when a minute signal appears on the data line as indicated by 93. It is because the gate T3 is in the tailing region at a very low level. However, when a bias charge is sent onto the data line, the operating point of tailing rises and a current which is as large as different order flows and for example, charges of about 99 move to the lower side of gate T2. In this charge, the signal charges of 99 are also included and when the bais charges are subtracted through the gate T1 89 , the signal charges can be moved to the sense amplifier input terminal 92 with a very good transfer efficiency. In above charge transfer transfer of signal charges can be done for each gate under the saturated mode as indicated by B 4 , B 5 . If such transfer is carried out under non saturated mode, transfer of signal charges is not conducted sufficiently due to the division of capacitance. Fig. 8 shows another driving method. This method is different from Fig. 7 in such a point that setting B 3 of bias charge and transfer of such bias charge to the sense amplifier input terminal through the gate T1 89 from the gate T2 88 are conducted under the condition that both T1 and T2 are ON. Thereby, the OFF level of each gate T1, T3 is simple cut off state and it is not required to think of the conductive state of current. Thus, low level setting of pulse can be done easily in many case, it can be set to 0V . Each reset of bias charge under the gate T2 described in Fig. 7 is carried out by setting the terminal 91 to low level in B 2 . In case charges are transerred many times, operations are more stabilized by repeating the steps B 2 B 6 t₃₂ t₄₁ . Here, the timing t₄₀ for making high level the pulse Fig. 9 shows another embodiment of structure of BCT amplifier which is different from that of Fig. 6 in such a point that n or n layer 101 is provided under the gate T2 88 . As is apparent from the potential diagrams of Fig. 7, Fig. 8, it is better that the gate T2 88 as the lowest threshold voltage V Fig. 10 is an embodiment where the tate T2 is considered as a capacitance formed by the electrodes 102 and 103 on the field by considering it as only a simple capacitance. Thereby, the processing for providing the n or n layer under the gate T2 is no longer necessary and the manufacturing process can be matched with that for ordinary memory LSI. If the gate T2 is formed as the enhancement type, when the low level of drive pulse In the embodiments of Fig. 9 and Fig. 10, such phenomenon does not occur and low level of Fig. 25 shows an embodiment indicating another structureof BCT amplifier which is different from the preceding embodiment in such a point that the gate T1 is eliminated. In this case, the bias charge under the gate T2 88 is given by a voltage to be applied to the terminal 91 through the precharge gate. When the pulse Fig. 11 shows practical example of circuit structure of the signal sense system as a whole of the MLS memory of the present invention. Fig. 12 shows the drive pulse waveforms and internal waveforms. In these figures, the elements given the same symbols such as 32, 33, 34, 27, 61, t₃, t₄, t₃₁ t₄₁, etc. indicate the same elements and timings, etc. The timing waveforms shown in Fig. 12 indicate the condition that the data 2 is just stored in the memory cell and it is then extracted, considering the case where the cell connected to the data line 6 is selected ata the memory cell and a dummy data in such an amount equal to 1 2 of signal charge appears from the side of data line 6D. In such figure, DP is a drive pulse and IW is internal waveform. When a voltage During the timing t₃₇ t₃₉, the data line voltage V Prior to this operation, the voltages V When the pulse The FF type sense amplifier shown as 33 in Fig. 11 has the input dynamic range as wide as V Fig. 13 shows a differential type high sensitivity amplifier as another embodiment of sense amplifier of the present invention. Fig. 14 shows drive pulse timings and internal waveforms. After the voltages V The timing t₃₅ t₄₀ means the period where the bias charge transfer already described is carried out. When The termial 133 is not connected to V Fig. 15 is another embodiment of sense amplifier used in the present invention. Fig. 16 shows the drive pulse DP timings and internal waveforms IW . The sense amplifier shown in Fig. 15 is not differential type and the dummy charge is not used for judgement. After the voltage V The sense amplifier of Fig. 15 has the characteristic that it can be realized with comparatively less amount of transistors and is suited to high integration. Fig. 17 shows internal waveforms to be used for actual MLS memory operation of 8 level 3 bit cell in the embodiment of the present invention shown in Fig. 1. In this figure, the lower stage indicates a voltage As is understood from Fig. 17, even when signal charge does not appear 0 5 , V As the peripheral circuit of MLS memory of the present invention shown in Fig. 1, for example, the address select circuits 24, 28 which are the same as those in the existing memory may be used. In the MLS memory of the present invention as shown in Fig. 4, conversion equivalent to A D, D A conversion between multiple level data and binary data can be realized with only a very small scale circuit by setting input and output of data as explaned below. Namely, the multiple level data read to the storage node 65 etc. of column register from the memory cell is read to the common input output line I O line Fig. 4 as the timing signal being synchronized with the pulses Fig. 18 and Fig. 19 respectively show the embodiments of decoder and encoder which have realized said input output circuits. Fig. 20 shows the drive pulse timing chart of the encoder shown in Fig. 19. Operations of embodiment of the decoder shown in Fig. 18 are as follow. For example, when the data Operations of embodiment of the encoder shown in Fig. 19 are as follow. With reference to Fig. 20, the node 191 is precharged to V As is already explained, the signal charges are inevitably reduced in accordance with a nummber of levels in order to obtain high integration density characteristic of the MLS memory. From the point of view of sensing the signals, such difficulty has been solved by voltage amplification of the bias charge transfer amplifier having a high efficiency as explained above. However, in the memory cell, noise charges are generated by a hat generating current J Fig. 21 shows an embodiment of circuit structure of triggering pulse generator 35 invented in view of solving problems mentioned above and Fig. 22 shows internal waveforms. A pulse generator shown in Fig. 21 increases the oscillation frequency as much as an increase of heat generating current hereinafter referred to as a leak current due to a temperature rise and thereby the refresh period of memory cell can be shortened and destruction of multiple level data by leak current can be prevented. A pulse generator 210 shown in Fig. 21 comprises a pseudo memory cell similar to memory cell. When the data stored therein is attenuated by the leak current 211 and the inverter circuit connected thereto is started. First, V Fig. 23 shows another embodiment of the present invention and Fig. 24 shows the operation principle. The same symbols as those in Fig. 1 show the portions having the same function. In the embodiment of Fig. 23, the stepping waveform sent from the stepping pulse generator 231 is stored in the storage capacitor electrode hereinafter called a plate 232 Here, it is supposed that the level 2 is stored, the bottom of electron potential of storage capacitor 24 sequentially ascends with sequential descending of On the contrary, in case the level 2 is to be written, for example, the data line voltage is set to a voltage which is a little higher than The embodiment shown in Fig. 23 and the driving method of Fig. 24 are characterized by that since it is not required to raise the data line to V In the embodiment shown in Fig. 23, the maximum charges Q The embodiments of the present invention described above employ the data line structure of folded bit line type as the memory structure shown in Fig. 1, Fig. 11 and Fig. 23. The present ivention can also be adapted to the data line structure of open bit line type as shown in Fig. 26. Fig. 26 shows an embodiment of the MLS memory of the present invention employing the open bit line type data line structure. The elements given the same numbers indicate the same elements. 261L, 261R are memory cells 262L, 262R are dummy cell 263L, 263R are bias charge transfer amplifier BCT ampliier 264L, 264R are row adress select and buffer circuits 267 is an input output circuit array and column address select gate block. When a memory cell 261L is selected, a dummy cell 262R is selected, the signal is respectively amplified by the BCT amplifiers 263L, 263R and are judged by the sense amplifier 33. After the signal is temporarily held by the column register 34, the signal is read through the input output circuit 267. The writing operation is also carried out as in the case of existing example. In the case of open bit line type, a memory having the general characteristic of this type, namely a memory having the performance that a high speed operation can be realized because the word line can be formed by the metal such as aluminium can be obtained. In an embodiment of the present invention explained above, the signal is mainly compared using a dummy cell as shown in Fig. 1, Fig. 11, Fig. 23 and Fig. 26. Namely, the present invention can be adapted to the system where the sense amplifier not using the dummy signal shown in Fig. 15 is used. However, as explained above, since signal charges per level of MLS memory are reduced in order to increase integration density as compared with DRAM of 1 bit cell, it is better to compare the signal using a dummy cell for the judgement with good S N. The signal sent to the sense amplifier from the BCT amplifier often allows in each reading operation superposition of equivalent noise charges other than the signal charges due to the influence of pulse coupling or tailing current. In this case, the signal can be more easily and accurately judged using the signal Q In the BCT amplifier of the present invention, the signal flows only in the one direction and therefore since the column address select gate and column register are opposingly located to the memory array for the sense amplifier, the consitution of the folded bit line type is simpler than tha tof open bit line type. The embodiment of the present invention described above is capable of further enhancing the effect thereof by the method, where the sense amplifier input terminals 92, 92D are divided, for example as shown in Fig. 11, by inserting a gate between the input terminal and BCT amplifier output terminal and thereby a coupling noise of pulse can be reduced. An embodiment of the present invention partly uses the CMOS complementary MOS circuit and it can be formed only with the N or P channel MOS transistor. However, if it is formed only with a single porality transistor, it is also followed by the general trend that power consumption increases. The driving method explained for the embodiment of the present invention is particularly considered for obtaining sufficient effect of the present invention but such method is not limited only to it and other method can also be adapted. As explained above, the present invention provides an MLS memory for addressing by both rows and columns with a low power consumption comprising an amplifier which is just suited to a large capacity memory because of its simple structure and is capable of amplifying a minute voltage with a low voltage drive pulse and a high precision A D, D A conversion means which also has small scale circuit structure and can be driven with a low voltage in view of high integration density. Thereby, a semiconductor file memory having an ultra high integration density which is expected for a small size computer system can be realized. Such semiconductor file memory fantastically improves a small size sotrage unit using semiconductor, for example, an IC cards, etc. The column register temporary storage circuit used in the present invention executes AD DA conversion between multiple level signal and digital information and plays a very important function for an MLS memory. In case of extracting information to the outside from the column register as shown in Fig. 4, reading is carried out serially in such a timing that the potential of input output signal changes. Therefore, in the case of reading a multiple level data, for example, the data of 16 levels, the control signals Accordingly, it is desirable to quickly read the data within a short period of time. In order to meet such requirement, a device which is capable of quickly reading the data of multiple levels, if it is required to read the data from the column register of the MLS memory, is provided. In order to attain such object, a second group of storage cells is disposed corresponding to the group of memory cells in such a column register that the digital data corresponding to the timing of voltage change of input signal sent from the sense amplifier is written into the group of storage cells and the data stored in said groups of storage cells is read and it is then written into the memory cells. Moreover, provided is the means which writes the digital data corresponding to the timing of voltage change of said input signal into said second group of storage cells and data is read in parallel from the second group of storage cells in the selected columns. Fig. 27 shows the structure of another embodiment of the column register of the present invention. The second storage cell groups 280, 281 have the same structure and therefore description about structure of storage cell 281 is omitted here. These storage cell groups are arranged in both upper and lower directions with a plurality of cells. For each cell 280, 281 of the second storage cell groups, the 3 MOS transistor type memory cell, namely, in the case of cell 280, a memory cell using 3 MOS transistors 284, 285, 286, three lines D₀, 282, 283 and the earth line is used. In this case, the transistor 284 is used for storing, the transistor 285 is used for reading, the line 282 is used as the write word line, the line 283 is used as the read word line, the line D₀ is as the data line and the point B is the storage node. In general, a number of second storage cells can be determined by log₂n for a number of levels n n is a positive integer of the MLS memory. It may be describ ed later, it is of course possible to set a number of second storage cells to a number of levels of MLS memory. From the view point of cost of the circuits to be used, it is obvious a less number of second storage cells results in a large economical merit. Fig. 28, Fig. 29, Fig. 30 respectively show the writing and reading operation time charts of the column register shown in Fig. 27. First, explained is the case where the digital data is written corresponding to the timing of the input signal in V In the case of four levels, the input signal The control signals In the example of Fig. 28, when only the control signal Operations of externally reading the data stored in the storage cells of the first column are explained by referring to Fig. 29. At this time, the lines D₀, D₁ of the second storage cells 280, 281 are precharged to H level and thereafter the column select signal Operations of externally writing the data to the first storage cell of the first column are explained by referring to Fig. 30. In this case, the switch 60 of Fig. 27 is turned OFF and the switch 287 is set to the side S₂ opposing to the position indicated in the figure. Thereby, the column select signal Operation of controlling output signal Fig. 31 shows a constitution of column register indicating another embodiment of the present invention. This embodiment is different from that in Fig. 27 in the the internal structure of the first group of storage cells 270 273, wherein three MOS transisors are comprised. Fig. 32 shows the operation time chart of the circuit shown in Fig. 31. Operation of controlling the output signal First, the line 62 connected to the output signal In above embodiment, the same MOS transistor 274 is used in common when the data corresponding to the timing of voltage change of input signal An example where the circuit structure is the same as Fig. 27 but the driving method for writing the data corresponding to the timing of voltage change of input signal Fig. 15 is the constitution of the column register indicating the other embodiment of the present invention, wherein a number of storage cells of the first group and a number of storage cells of the second group are equal to a number of multiple levels n n 4 . Fig. 16 shows the operation timing chart for writing the data corresponding to the timing of voltage change of input signal In this embodiment, the control signals Fig. 34 shows a circuit configuration of the column register of another embodiment of the present invention. Fig. 19 and Fig. 20 show the operation time charts thereof. In Fig. 34, the second group of storage cells 280, 281 is composed of 4 MOST type memory cells. The 4 MOST type memory cell is provided with two data lines in order to execute the differential type reading and writing operations. Accordingly, as shown in Fig. 35, the control signals Fig. 37 is a circuit diagram of column register indicating further embodiment of the present invention. The second group of storage cells 28O, 281 is formed by the 1 MOST type memory cell. This embodiment has an advantage that the second group of storage cells occupies only a small area. However, the 1 MOST type memory cell is not provided with the amplification function in itself and therefore it requiries the amplifiers 37O and 371 for amplifying the signal read from the cells 28O,281. As explained above, the column register of the MLS memory of the present invention is capable of externally reading the data stored in the group of storage cells of the one column and simultaneously writing external data into the group of storage cells of the one column and also storing the multiple level signals in a small number of cells, thus realizing high speed data transfer and parallel writing and reading. The present invention also provides a fault tolerate circuit which is just suited to the memory which serially executes data reading and writing. Fault tolerate can be done as explained below in the memory which serially reads and writes the data. The location of defective memory cell among the regular memory cells, namely in which number the defective memory cell is selected during the serial reading and writing is previously written into the ROM Read Only Memory . At the time of data reading writing , content of data written in the ROM is compared with a number of times of data reading writing . In case these are matched, the regular memory cell is not selected and the spare memory cell is selected. Namely, at the timing of selecting the defective dta line, such timing is stored in the ROM and and the spare memory cell is selected through the switching operation. Fig. 38 shows an embodiment of the present invention. This memory provides the word lines W First, the fault toleration free data reading and writing operations are explained. The address signals a₀ a Then, the data lines D₀, D₁ ....., D For each selection of single data line, data is output to the external output terminal D Next, fault toleration is explained in detail. First, a counter 387 is explained. As a counter 387, those which can count from 0 to N 1 2 Then, ROM s 388, 389 and comparators 390, 391 are explained. Fig. 41 shows the structure of a pair of ROM and comparator. As the ROM, EPROM, E²PROM or a fuse to blow by laser can be used but the fuses F₀ F The outputs y₀ y Here, a number of fuses is set to n 1 in place of n because one fuse F Next, a switching circuit 392 is explained. Fig. 42 shows an example of circuit structure. This circuit switches between the regular data line and spare data line in accordance with the outputs of said comparators Since two spare data lines are prepared in this embodiment, fault toleration is possible even when there is a fault in the two regular data line D In this embodiment, fault toleration is not carried out for the word lines. However, one word line can be selected arbitrarily by the decoder 2 and therefore fault tolerate of word lines can also be done in the same way as the existing method. In above embodiment, data reading or writing is executed sequentially for all memory cells on a single word line but it can also be done for only a part of memory cell on the word line. Fig. 43 shows this example where the reading or writing is carried out to N 4 memory cells among N memory cells on the single word line in the embodiment of Fig. 38. This embodiment is described in detail below. The memory array 381, decoder 382, word line drive circuit 383 and read circuits SSA₀, SSA₁, SA₀ SA The fault tolerate circuit of the present embodiment is now explained. First, since the counter 387 is capable of counting from O to Next, the comparators 390 and 391 are explained. Fig. 44 shows the structure of comparator. The circuit structure itself is the same as that shown in Fig. 41 but there is such a difference that the address signals a The switching circuit 392 is the same as that shown in Fig. 42 and therefore explanation thereof is omitted here. Fig. 45 shows another embodiment of the present invention. This embodiment is characterized by providing redundant bits by the error correcting code hereinafter referred to as ECC . For simplification, the ECC uses 4 information bits, 3 check bits and cyclic Hamming code and other codes can of course be used for the present invention. Of 7 data lines, D₀ to D₃ are used as the inforamtion storing and D₄ D₆, for storing redundant bits of ECC. The redundant bits for ECC are added in the encoding circuit 450 and error correction is carried out in the decoding circuit. This embodiment is explained in detail. The memory array 381, decoder 382, word line drive circuit 383 and sense amplifiers SSA₀, SSA₁, SA₀ SA The encoding circuit 450 his explained hereunder. This circuit executes encoding serially in synchronization with the clock pulse using the nature of cyclic code. When the clock pulse is first applied four times, the data entering from external input terminal D The decoding circuit 460 is described. This circuit executes the decoding serially in synchronization with the clock pulse , using the nature of cyclic code. When the clock pulse is first applied seven times, the data lines are selected in the sequence of D₀, D₁, ...., D₆ by the data line select circuit 388 and the data read from each memory cell is sequentially applied to the decoding circuit through the input output line I O. At this time, 460 executes the calculation of syndrome. Next, when the clock plulse is applied seven times, the error corrected data are sequentially issued to the input output line I O. At this time, the data lines D₀ Here, the fault tolerate circuit of this embodiment is explained. First, the counter 387 is described below. As is described above, in the case of data reading operation, the data lines are selected in the sequence of D₀, D₁, ...., D₆, and thereby output of counter 387 must be changed in the sequence of 0 , 1 ,...., 6 , 0 , 1 ,...., 6 . This can be realized by employing a septenary counter using JK flip flop shown in Fig. 47. The ROM s 388 and 389, comparators 390, 391 and switching circuit 392 are the same as those shown in Fig. 42. However, since total of seven data lines are prepared including the redundant data lines for ECC, the ROM requires 4 bits one bit of them is used for identifying whether fault tolerate must be conducted or not and the exclusive OR gate of comparator requires three bits. As described above, the present invention can introde the fault toleration for the memory which serially carries out data reading and writing and thereby a chip containing a small number of defects can be converted to a good chip,thus improving the yield.
