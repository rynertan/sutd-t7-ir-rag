## Description
This invention relates to difluoromethane sulphuric acid and the preparation and use thereof. Trifluoromethanesulphonic acid, CF3SO3H, and pentafluoroethanesulphonic acid, CF3CF2S03H are the lowest members of a series of perfluoroalkanesulphonic acids described in the specification of United Kingdom Patent 758,467. The route described for the preparation of the perfluoroalkanesulphonic acids involves as the first stage the preparation of the corresponding sulphuric acid fluoride by electrolysing a mixture of anhydrous liquid hydrogen fluoride and a hydrocarbon sulphonic acid. The reactions and uses of trifluoromethane sulphuric acid sometimes known by the trivial name triflic acid are reviewed by Howells et al in Chemical Reviews, 1977, Vol 77, page 69 onwards. Trifluoromethanesulphonic acid is therein described as having been used in a variety of Friedel Crafts reactions, including alkylation of benzene and other aromatic hydrocarbons and isomerisation and cracking of alkanes or alkyl substituted aromatic hydrocarbons, and also in cationic polymerisation and other reactions in which a strong acid catalyst is required. The use of trifluoromethanesulphonic acid in promoting the hydrogen fluoride catalysed alkylation of isoparaffins having 4 or 5 carbon atoms with mono olefins havinq from 3 to 6 carbon atoms is described in US Patent 4 118 433.t In US Patent 3 370 721 there is described a liquid phase alkylation process for the production of alkylate useful as motor fuel wherein low molecular weight isoparaffins are alkylated with oleo in hydrocarbons in the presence of a catalyst comprising a mixture of a majDr proportion of sulphuric acid with a minor proportion of trifluoromethane sulphonic acid. In Canadian Patent 1 093581 there is described a process for the production of chlorofluorinated sulphonic acids by the catalytic oxychlorofluorinat ion of certain sulphur containing starting materials. Difluoromethanesulphonic acid, CF2HS03H, is listed as one of eight halomethanesulphonic acids detected by gas chromatographic analysis of the effluent from the gas phase reaction between di monochloromethyl sulphide, HF and oxygen CF2HS03H is also listed as one of the five halomethanesulphonic acids detected in the effluent from the corresponding reaction of di monochloromonofluoromethyl sulphoxide.In neither case is the proportion of CF2HS03H stated there is no description of the isolation, properties or uses of this compound. We have now found that difluoromethanesulphonic acid, CF2HS03H, is a sufficiently strong acid to be effective as a catalyst or a promoter in contexts in which trifluoromethanesulphonic acid is known to be useful. Difluoromethanesulphonic acid has a higher boiling point than trifluoromethanesulphonic acid, and consequently can usually be separated more readily from the products of organic reactions in which it is used as acid catalyst. The greater degree of hydrogenbonding in difluoromethanesulphonic acid also favours the separation of this compound from the organic phase of a reaction product mixture.Furthermore, difluoromethanesulphonic acid may conveniently be prepared in substantially pure liquid form from chlorodifluoromethane, a readily available starting material, by a method not involvinq electrolytic fluorination as is required for trifluoromethanesulphonic acid the Preparation of difluoromethanesulphonic acid is therefore more economically tractive. Accordinq to the present invention there is provided difluoromethanesulphonic acid CF2HS03H in liquid form, in the form of an aqueous solution thereof or in the form of its hydrate. Another aspect of the invention consists in the use of difluoromethanesulphonic acid as an acid catalyst or as a promoter of an acid catalyst. Difluoromethanesulphonic acid, the compound of the present invention, may be prepared from an alkali metal difluoromethanesulphonate, by heating with a mineral acid, for example sulphuric acid, and distillinq off the free difluoromethanesulphonic acid from the reaction mixture under reduced pressure T preferably 988 1008 sulphuric acid is used in this process. The preparation of sodium difluoromethanesulphonate by the reaction between chlorodifluoromethane and aqueous sodium sulphite heptahydrate is described by Farrar J. Chem. Soc 1960, page 3062 as a stage in the preparation of difluoromethanesulphonanilide and other n aryl difluoro methanesulphonamides. There are, however, difficulties in the preparation of sodium difluoromethanesulphonate.The erratic and often poor yields in the reaction between CHF2C1 and sodium sulphite are described by Moore in J.Org.Chem.44, 1708 l979 . We have found that difluoromethanesulphonic acid may advantageously be prepared via the potassium salt. The relatively higher solubility of potassium sulphite in water compared with that of sodium sulphite allows a relatively higher concentration of sulphite ions to be present in the reaction with chlorodifluoromethane a relatively higher efficiency of conversion of the chlorodifluoromethane to the difluoromethanesulphonate and consequently to the acid may therefore be achieved. Thus according to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of preparation of difluoromethanesulphonic acid which comprises the steps of a preparing potassium difluoromethanesulphonate by the reaction of chlorodifluoromethane with aqueous potassium sulphite and b heating the potassium difluoromethanesulphonate with a strong mineral acid and distilling off the free difluoromethanesulphonic acid from the reaction mixture under reduced pressure. The most convenient mineral acid is sulphuric acid but other acids which may be used include orthophosphoric acid and hydrogen fluoride. Prior to step b the potassium difluoro methanesulphonate prepared by step a is preferably purified by extraction into an organic solvent, followed by evaporation of the solvent.The preferred solvent for this purpose is acetone especially aqueous acetone containing about 58 by volume of water other solvents which may be used include industrial methylated spirits. Difluoromethanesulphonic acid may be used, in qeneral, as acid catalyst in reactions of the type in which trifluoromethanesulphonic acid is known to be useful, for example the reactions already referred to herein. The reaction conditions and the proportion of the acid employed optionally in conjnnction with other catalysts are in general those known in the art in respect of trifluoromethanesulphonic acid. The invention is illustrated by the followingExamples. Parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise stated. Difluoromethanesulphonic acid also has potential application as an electrolyte, for example in fuel cells T the compound is nonwetting towards poly tetrafluoroethylene which makes it especially useful in such applications.EXAMPLE 1 Sodium difluoromethanesulphonate was prepared by the reaction between chlorodifluoromethane and sodium sulphite heptahydrate as described byFarrar op cit . The crude sodium salt product contained about 25 of sodium difluoromethanesulphonate. The crude sodium salt 5Og was mixed with industrial methylated spirits 600 ml and the mixture was stirred under reflux for 4 hours.At the end of this period the mixture was cooled and the insoluble material was removed by filtration and the filtrate was evaporated to dryness to yield a solid concentrate 7.8g containing 70 sodium difluoromethanesulphonate. The dry concentrate was added slowly to 98 sulphuric acid 22 ml at 400C 50 C with stirring. Distillation of the mixture gave 9.8g difluoromethanesulphonic acid, boiling point 7l0C 790C at 0.3 0.4 m bar. Redistillation gave difluoromethanesulphonic acid as a colourless hygroscopic liquid, boiling point 75 C at 1 m bar, density 1.72 g ml at 25eC. Difluoromethanesulphonic acid forms a monohydrate, melting point 55 C, which is a white, crystalline deliquescent solid the monohydrate can be distilled unchanged from sulphuric acid. The acid strength pea of difluoromethanesulphonic acid was measured and found to be 5.7. By way of comparison pKU for trifluoromethanesulphonic acid is 4.7 and pK for sulphuric acid is 7.0 . Difluoromethanesulphonic acid, CF2HS03H was characterised by nuclear magnetic resonance and by infra red spectrum as follows.Nuclear magnetic resonance Recorded using a Jeol FXl00 Fourier transform spectrometer. 1H and 19F spectra were recorded at 100MHz and 93.7 MHz respectively.

A mixture of propene 13.6 volumes and nitrogen 1 volume was circulated through a mixture of 22g dry toluene and 0.74g difluoromethanesulphonic acid 0.024 mole mole toluene in a closed system at a rate of about 1001 hour, the temperature of the liquid being held at 105 20C. As the propene reacted the pressure in the system was restored by introducing more propene from a cylinder.After 30 minutes the gas flow was stopped and the liquid washed with water and analysed by gas liquid chromatography. The propene consumed in this time was 1.01 mole per mole of toluene and the alkylatesProduced comprised 51.28 monoisopropyltoluenes, 47.2 diisopropyl toluenes and 1.6 triisopropyl toluenes. EXAMPLE 3 This Example shows the use of difluoromethanesulphonic acid as a catalyst for the alkylation of p xylene by ethylene. A mixture of ethylene 5.6 volumes and nitrogen l volume was circulated through a mixture of 21.5g p xylene and l.Og difluoromethanesulphonic acid 0.037 mole difluoromethanesulphonic acid per mole of p xylene at 130 C. The pressure was restored with ethylene as the ethylene reacted. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 6 hours, after which the gas flow was stopped and the liquid washed with water and analysed by gas chromatography. The ethylene consumed amounted to 0.2 mole per mole of xylene and the alkylate comprised 75.4 monoethyl p xylene, 17.5 diethyl p xylenes and 4.4 triethyl p xylenes.EXAMPLE 4 Potassium difluoromethanesulphonate was prepared by the reaction between chlorodifluoromethane 86.5g, 1 mole in 500 ml water at 120 C for 5 hours in a sealed vessel. The crude potassium salt product contained about 25 of potassium difluoromethanesulphonate. 57 of the chlorodifluoromethane was consumed and of the chlorodifluoromethane consumed 70 was converted into potassium difluoromethanesulphonate. The crude potassium salt 50g was mixed with industrial methylated spirits 600 ml and the mixture was stirred under reflux for 4 hours.At the end of this period the insoluble material was removed by filtration and the filtrate was evaporated to dryness to yield a solid concentrate 21g containing 60 potassium difluoromethanesulphonate. The dry concentrate was added slowly to 98 sulphuric acid 23 ml at 40 C 50 C with stirring. Distillation of the mixture gave 8.9g difluoromethanesulphonic acid, boiling point 71 C 79 C at 0.3 0.4 mbar. Redistillation gave difluoromethanesulphonic acid as a colourless hygroscopic liquid, boiling point 79 C 80 C at 1 mbar density, 1.72 q ml at 25 C. EXAMPLE 5 This Example shows the use of difluoromethanesulphonic acid in the alkylation of isobutane. A stainless steel pressure vessel was cooled to 20 C and charged with isobutane 25 g , cis but . 2 ene 2 g , hydrogen fluoride 24 g and difluoromethanesulphonic acid 3 g . The contents of the vessel were allowed to warm to 0 C under autogenous pressure and vigorously shaken under these conditions for a period of 5 minutes. At the end of this period the excess hydrocarbon was slowly vented from the vessel and the liquid products were decanted into a polythene separating funnel. The organic alkylate the upper layer was analysed by gas liquid chromatography and the octane rating of the alkylate was computed by the method described by Hutson andLogan, Hydrocarbon Processing ,1975 page 107.The octane rating was found to be 97.4. By way of comparison, the same procedure was repeated except that the difluoromethanesulphonic acid was omitted and that the reaction period was 10 minutes. The octane rating of the product was found to be 93.4.
