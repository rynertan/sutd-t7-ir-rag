# A VIBRATION ABSORBER AND DAMPER

## Abstract
A damper which is adapted to support a static load of a device, for example an engine or a machine element, subjected to vibrations and movements and for pereventing transmission of and damping these vibrations and move ments comprises damping means 6,8,10 consisting of elastomeric material and a device 12 separated from said damping means for supporting substantially the whole static load so that the static load does not exert any influence on the function of preventing transmission of vibrations and the damping function of the damping means consisting of elastomeric material.
