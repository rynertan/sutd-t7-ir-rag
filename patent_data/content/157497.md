# Improved phonemic classification in speech recognition system.

## Abstract
An acoustic processing unit for a speech recognition system is characterized in that the parameters are extracted from the speech data, including correlation functions, zero crossing number of the original waveforms, the zero crossing number of the differential waveforms, and the average level of the waveforms. A suitable threshold is selected from a plurality of thresholds preliminarily stored, depending on the inputted speech colume level. The inputted speech colume level of the speaker is detected so that the detected volume level is feed backed. The selected threshold set is then compared with each of the parameters to thereby make the phonemic classification. Because the plurality of threshold sets are thus automatically selected depending on the inputted speech volume level, flexible phonemic classification can be obtained to exactly detect the speech sections.
