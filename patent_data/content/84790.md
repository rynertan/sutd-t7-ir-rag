# Stepped piston and stepped piston engine.

## Abstract
A stepped piston P, 19, 31, 50 for an engine of the kind having one or more cylinders 18, 30, 40, 51 , the or each cylin der containing a stepped piston having a pumping part 4 of larger diameter, and a working part 1 of smaller diameter, the working part 1 of the piston P, 19, 31, 50 being slidable in, and associated with, a working part of the cylinder 18, 30, 40, 51 in which combustion of a fuel air mixture takes place, and the pumping part 4 of the piston being slidable in, and asso ciated with, a pumping part of the cylinder, the piston having a body with an interior hollow 1, 1 , 39, 45 opening to the out side of a lower end 5 of the piston, the body comprising a smaller diameter 1 working, part, extending from the top 2 of the piston P, 19, 31, 50 to a step 3 , and a larger diameter 4 pumping, part extending from the step 3 to a lower end 5 of the piston, at least one piston ring groove 6, 7 20, 21, 22 32, 33, 34 41, 42, 43 formed in an outer surface of the smaller diameter part 1 and at least one piston ring groove 8, 9 formed in the outer surface of the larger diameter part 4 , each piston ring groove, in use, receiving a piston ring 10, 11 23, 24, 25 35, 36, 37 46, 47, 48 12, 13 , the smaller diameter part 1 of the piston having at least one metering opening 15, 16 26 38 44 70, 71 providing a through passage for lubri cant, between the interior 1, 1 39, 45 of the piston and the outer surface of the smaller diameter part 1 of the piston.
