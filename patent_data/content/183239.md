# System and method for detecting the condition of combustion in a combustion engine.

## Abstract
Pressure within an engine combustion chamber is sensed. The timing at which the sensed pressure peaks is detected, and the interval between the moment of spark generation and the detected timing of the pressure peak is measured. The presently detected timing of the pressure peak is selectively adopted or ignored in accordance with the measured interval. When the presently detected timing of the pressure peak is ignored, the previously accepted timing value of the pressure peak is adopted in its place.
