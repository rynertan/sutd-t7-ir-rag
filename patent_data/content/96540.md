# A method and apparatus for producing spun yarn having true twist.

## Abstract
A tufted twist spinning method is provided for producing spun yarns by drawing fibres out of a staple fibre bundle 1 by intermittent drafting, giving real twist to the fibres, wherein a spun yarn having real twist is produced by employing a spinning rotor 3 adapted for twisting operation and provided with a false twisting mechanism 14 in such a way that the yarn is given real twist at the rate of two or more turns for each turn of the spinning rotor 3, as compared with the single turn per turn of the rotor given by conventional methods. This is achieved by accumulating a mass of drawn out fibres on the surface of the spinning rotor 3 and allowing them to come into contact with a yarn end caused to rotate by the false twister 14.
