The probe may comprise a secondary cylindrical insulator having a bore therethrough adapted to receive the rod member, the cylindrical insulator having a bore of sufficient diameter to accommodate both the secondary cylin drical insulator and the rod member, the cylindrical insula tor and the secondary cylindrical insulator being mountable to the rod member to electrically insulate the metal mounting body from the electrode connector. The other end of the rod member may be threaded and the com pression means may comprise a nut co acting with the thread ed end, and a further cylindrical insulator having a bore therethrough adapted to receive the rod member and being adapted to separate the nut from the outside surface of the metal mounting body, the arrangement being such that when the nut is screwed in the direction of the head member, the insulator may be placed in compression between the head member and the metal mounting body, while the further insu lator may be placed in compression between the nut and the outside surface of the metal mounting body. Preferably, a further gasket is provided between the further insulator and the metal mounting body. The further gasket may be adapted to absorb at least a portion of the difference in thermal expansion of the insulator and the metal mounting body. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, at least one of the gaskets comprises asbestos fibres. Preferably, the flat surfaces of at least one of the gaskets is coated with graphite. The electrical conductivity probe may also comprise a sheath adapted to sealingly envelop the cylindrical outer surfaces of the insulator and the gaskets. Conveniently, the sheath is a crimp on or shrink tube adapted to shrink with the application of heat. Also according to the invention, the rod member may be electrically insulated from the metal mounting body by means of an insulating tube provided annually between the rod member and the inside surface of the bore through the metal mounting body. The invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which In the drawings, reference numeral 10 generally indicates an electrical conductivity probe. The probe 10 comprises a conductive electrode connector 12 including a rod member 12.1 and a head member 12.2 connected to one end of the rod member 12.1. The probe 10 also comprises a metal mounting body 14 having a bore 14.1 therethrough along its longitudinal axis, the bore 14.1 being of a sufficient diameter to accommodate the rod member 12.1 without making electrical contact there with. Means for mounting the metal mounting body 14 to a side wall 16 of a pressure vessel is provided in the form of a screw thread on the outside surface of the metal mounting body 14. The probe 10 further comprises a cylindrical insulator 18 capable of withstanding high temperatures and pressures up to 21 MPa, the cylindrical insulator also having a bore 18.1 therethrough along its longitudinal axis, the bore being of a sufficient diameter to accommodate the rod member 12.1 and a secondary insulator not shown . The cylindrical insulator 18 is mountable on the rod member 12.1 to elec trically insulate the metal mounting body 14 from the head 12.2 of the electrode connector 12. The probe 10 further comprises a ring shaped sealing gasket 20 made of compressed asbestos fibre, at either end of the insulator 18. The flat surfaces of the gaskets 20 are coated with graphite, so as to improve their resistance to the said high temperatures and pressures. The end 12.3 of the rod member opposite the head member 12.2 is threaded. A further insulator 22 is provided on the out side of the metal mounting body 14, and is separated there from by a further gasket 23 adapted to absorb at least a portion of the difference in thermal expansion of the fur ther insulator 22 and the metal mounting body 14. The further insulator 22 is also of tubular construction with an inside diameter sufficiently large to accommodate the rod member 12.1. The rod member 12.1 extends through the insulator 18, the metal mounting body 14 and the further insulator 22. Washers 24, having an outside diameter more or less the same as the out side diameter of the further insulator 22, and a split washer 26, together with a nut 28 are respectively passed over the end 12.3 of the rod member 12.2 and screwed tight so as to establish the insulator 18 in compression between the head member 12.2 and the metal mounting body 14, while the further insulator 22 is placed in compression between the nut 28 and the outside surface of the metal mounting body 14. An electrical terminal 30 is provided between the nut 28 and the washer 24, whereby the rod member may be electri cally connected to an electric circuit not shown . As can be seen in the drawings, the terminal 30, the rod member 12.1 and the head member 12.2 are all electrically connected to each other, but are electrically insulated from the metal mounting body 14 and the wall 16 of the pressure vessel. The wall 16 of the pressure vessel is connected to the elec tric circuit. When a conductive liquid such as water in a boiler, comes into contact with both the wall 16 of the pressure vessel and the head 12.2 of the electrode connector, an electrical circuit between the wall 16 and the head 12.2 is completed, providing a switch whereby an electrical current flowing from the wall of the pressure vessel 16 to the head 12.2 of the electrode connector, or vice versa, may be employed to light up an indicator light on a panel. This could therefore be used as an indication that water in the pressure vessel has reached the level at which the probe 10 is located. A shrink tube 32 is provided on the outside surfaces of the insulator 18 and the gaskets 20. Such shrink tubes are available commercially under the trade mark VITON A . The composition of the shrink tube is unknown to the applicant, and it is believed to be proprietary. It is, however, suit able for application with high temperatures and pressures as are encountered in steam boilers of the type referred to hereinbefore. The tube 32 is crimped onto the outside surfaces of the insulator 18 and the gaskets 20 by the applicatioin of heat.
