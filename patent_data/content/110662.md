# Dot printer head.

## Abstract
A dot printer head in which a radial array of armatures are disposed opposite to a yoke and cores equipped with coils, and the armatures are actuated together with needles by exciting the coils to perform a desired printing operation. In this arrange ment, a magnetic flux generated from each core flows to the yoke via the associated armature and then returns to the former core while partially flowing through another magnetic path by way of the adjacent armature to the yoke and returning to the former core, whereby required magnetic paths are obtained without the necessity of increasing the areas of the mutually opposed surfaces of the armature and the yoke. Thus, the ra dial width of the yoke is reduced as well as the distance from the fulcrum of the armature to the core, so that the distance from the fulcrum of the armature to the force end thereof can be sufficiently lengthened against the distance from the arma ture fulcrum to the core. Consequently, a great force of mag netic attraction is producible while the air gap between the ar mature and the core is maintained to be narrow, and further more the equivalent mass of the armature can be reduced to achieve high speed printing with an economy of the power consumption.
