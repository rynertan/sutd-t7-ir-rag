## Description
DESCRIPTIONPROCESS FOR PRODUCING STYRENES The present invention relates to a process for producing styrene or nucleus substituted styrenes by the catalytic decomposition of l,l diarylethanes in gaseous phase. Styrene and nucleus substituted styrenes are very useful as intermediates for production of plastics and fine chemicals such as agricultural chemicals. It is well known that the styrene and nucleussubstituted styrenes are produced by catalytically decomposing l,l diarylethanes at 3500C to 6000C in the presence of a solid catalyst such as silica, alumina, silica alumina or kaolin J.K. Dixon and K.W. Saunders I. E. C., 46, No. 4, 652 , or by decomposing l,l diarylethanes at 3500C to 6000C in the presence of silica gel with continuous addition of hydrogen chloride gas or its aqueous solution PublishedExamined Japanese Patent Application No. 28499 1974 . As a result of the examination of these well known methods, however, the followings were found by the present inventors in carrying out the decomposition of l,l ditolylethane using silica alumina as catalyst, when a conversion of l,l ditolylethane is 60 to 80 , the selectivity of p methylstyrene is as low as 40 to 60 , and p ethyltoluene which is a hydrdgenated product of p methylstyrene, is produced as by product in an amount as much as 30 to 40 and in carrying out the decomposition of l,l ditolylethane using silica gel and hydrogen chloride in combination, when a conversion of l,l ditolylethane is 50 to 70 , the selectivity of pmethylstyrene is 25 to 35 and the amount of ethyltoluene, a by product, is as low as 3 but considerable amounts of p methylstyrene polymer are produced. The present inventors extensively studied to improve these well known methods, and found that zeolite is very superior as a catalyst for decomposition of 1,1diarylethane. The present invention is to provide a process for producing a styrene of the formula II and or III EMI2.1 wherein R1 to R6 are each a hydrogen atom or a methyl group, which comprises subjecting a l,l diarylethane of the formula I ,EMI2.2 wherein R1 to R6 are as defined above, to gas phase catalytic decomposition at a temperature of 3000C to 7000C in the presence of zeolite as a catalyst. The or present invention will be illustrated in more detail hereinafter. l,l Diarylethanes used as a starting material in the present invention include for example l,l diphenylethane, l phenyl l tolylethane, l phenyl l xylylethane, l phenyl l trimethylphenylethane, l,l ditolylethane, 1tolyl l xylylethane, l tolyl l trimethylphenylethane, 1,1dixylylethane, l xylyl l trimethylphenylethane and l,l bis trimethylphenyl ethane. Of these, l,l ditolylethane and l,l dixylylethane are particularly effectively applied for the catalytic decomposition in accordance with the present invention. The l,l diarylethane may be synthesized by any method. For example, it can be synthesized by reacting an aromatic compound with acetaldehyde or styrenes at low temperatures with sulfuric acid as catalyst, or by reacting an aromatic compound with acetylene with mercury sulfate and conc. sulfuric acid as catalyst. Preferred zeolite used as the catalyst in the present invention is such that the diameter of pores is 5 to 15 and the molar ratio of SiO2 to A1203 is 0.5 to 400 1, particularly preferably 1 to 300 1. When the molar ratio of SiO2 to A1203 is below this range, such zeolite is unsuitable as the catalyst because of its poor heat resistance. While when the molar ratio is far beyond this range, the development of acidity is insufficient so that the catalytic activity is lowered. Zeolite used in the present invention may be any of the H form de cation form , alkaline earth metal substituted form and rare earth metal substituted form. Also, zeolite used in the present invention may be natural zeolite or synthetic one, and includes, for example, the X form and the Y form of faujasite, mordenite, chabazite and the like. In the present invention, zeolite used as the catalyst can be dealuminum treated in advance with an inorganic or organic acid to increase the molar ratio of silica alumina as well as the surface area and pore volume of the catalyst, whereby the conversion of l,l diarylethane and the selectivity of styrenes can remarkably be improved.Any zeolite may be used for the preparation of dealuminumtreated zeolite so far as it has a pore diameter of 5 to 15 , a SiO2 A1203 molar ratio of 2.5 or more and a strong acid resistance. Example of such starting zeolite include super stable zeolite produced by cation exchanging theY form faujasite with an ammonium ion, followed by baking, synthetic mordenite and L form zeolite. In carrying out the dealuminum treatment, such zeolite is subjected to heating under reflux with an inorganic or organic acid so as to make the molar ratio of SiO2 to A1203 5 to 400, particularly preferably 10 to 300. In order to effectively attain the desired molar ratio, it is preferred to repeat several times a manner including the aforesaid heat treatment, separation of the treated zeolite and then drying. In this manner, the drying includes a baking at 3000 to 7000C in the stream of steam, nitrogen or air or a mixture thereof. As the acid used for preparing the catalyst, dealuminum treated zeolite, of the present invention, any of inorganic acids and organic ones, for example hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid and acetic acid, may be used.Particularly, however, hydrochloric acid is preferred. The concentration of the acid is 0.2 to 10 N, particularly preferably 0.5 to 5 N. When the acid concentration is below this range, a time required for the SiO2 A1203 molar ratio to reach the pre determined value becomes too long.While when the concentration is far beyond this range, the crystallinity of zeolite becomes extremely poor so that zeolite becomes similar to non crystalline silica alumina.As a result, the amount of ethyltoluene, a by product, increases and the selectivity of methylstyrene becomes low. In carrying out the catalytic decomposition, the reaction temperature is controlled to 3000 to 7000C, particularly preferably 4000 to 6000C. Reaction temperatures far beydnd this range promotes side reactions to lower the selectivity. While reaction temperatures far below this range lower the reaction rate to result in economical disadvantage. The reaction pressure is not particularly limited so far as the reaction system maintains a gaseous phase under the reaction conditions. Generally, however, it is preferred to carry out the reaction under atmospheric or increased pressures. In the present invention, the reaction system may contain one or more of nitrogen gas, carbon dioxide gas, steam and hydrogen gas in addition to l,l diarylethane, a starting material. The amount of the gas added is preferably 0.005 to 50 moles per mole of the l,l diarylethane. When these gases are not added to the reaction system, the deposition of carbon onto catalyst becomes so remarkable that the life of catalyst is shortened. Amounts of the gas beyond the above range are not particularly unfavorable to the reaction, but they are not desirable on account of economical disadvantages. Particularly when the reaction is carried out in a reductive atmosphere containing hydrogen gas, the amounts of hydrogenated by products of styrene or nucleus substituted styrenes e.g. ethylbenzene, ethyltoluene, ethylxylene, ethyltrimethylbenzene are decreased to result in an increase in the conversion of l,l diarylethane and selectivity of styrene or nucleus substituted styrenes as well as in the remarkable prolongation of the life of catalyst. The amount of hydrogen is preferably 0.01 to 50 moles, more preferably 0.1 to 20 moles, per mole of the 1,1diarylethane. The aforesaid additive effect cannot be attained in amounts of hydrogen below this range. Amounts of hydrogen beyond this range are not particularly unfavorable to the reaction, but they are not undesirable on account of economical disadvantages. In the present invention, the space velocity of the reaction gas is preferably 500 to 20,000 her 1, particularly preferably 1,000 to 12,000 her 1. But the space velocity may optionally be selected according to the composition of reaction gas, kind of catalyst and reaction temperature. The reaction of the present invention may be carried out by any process of a fixed bed,moving bed or fluidized bed process. The present invention will be illustrated in more detail with reference to the following examples, which are not however to be interpreted as limiting the invention thereto.
