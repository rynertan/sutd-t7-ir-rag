# Immunoassay.

## Abstract
An immunoassay by which a plurality of kinds of anti gens or antibodies in one test sample may be simultaneous ly quantified. Each of a plurality of kinds of microcapsules is first provided for each kind of a plurality of antigens or antibodies to be quantified such that the microcapsules bind an antibody or antigen specific to one kind of the plurality of antigens or antibodies to be quantified. The microcap sules ares formed of a membrane capable of being lysed by the complement activity, and each kind of microcapsules contains therein a substance that is quantifiable and does not interact with another quantifiable substance contained in other kinds of microcapsules. The plurality of kinds of microcapsules are mixed with a test sample and comple ment, and the quantifiable substances are released from the microcapsules upon lysis of the microcapsules by the com plement activity. The quantifiable substances are then quan tified.
