## Description
This invention relates to a sonar which filters the noise resulting from surface reverberation. This invention is a further advance pertaining to the processing of sea surface reverberation noise from the return signal of a bistatic or multistatic sonar. Convergence zones are created by the refractive properties of the ocean. The refracted sound rays from an active transmission are reflected from the sea surface causing surface reverberation which, for a first convergence zone, can be nominally located at a range of about thirty miles from the sonar transmission source, have a two mile width and be thought of as an extended interference source in horizontal and vertical angles made up of a multitude of spatially uncorrelated reflections. When the surface reverberation noise signal returns along the side lobes, or the main lobe of the sonar signal, the target signal from a low doppler, submerged target located within the convergence zone is virtually indistinguishable from the surface reverberation noise signal located above it. Consequently, detection of the target by conventional sonars is virtually impossible. Conventional beamforming with an array of hydrophones may be inadequate because the sea surface reverberation interference is sufficiently strong to limit detection even though it appears in the side lobes of the array response or because it appears close enough to the signal that it falls in the main lobe of the array response. Heretofore, optimal or adaptive array processing with any of a number of optimality criteria has been suggested to reject interfering plane waves. An algorithm often implemented in practice to reject such interference has been the Least Mean Square hereinafter also referred to as LMS interference canceller. A beam is steered in the direction of interest using all hydrophones but one which is used as a reference hydrophone. The output of the reference hydrophone is passed through a finite impulse response filter with adaptive coefficients and the filter output subtracted from the beam output. The finite impulse response coefficients are updated using the LMS algorithm to minimize the mean square value of the difference. That is, the beam output serves as the primary input and the reference hydrophone signal as the input to a LMS adaptive noise canceller. When the plane wave interference is much stronger than the background noise and the sonar target signal, this approach provides effective rejection of the interference. However, in some sonar applications, the interference, though highly directional, cannot be modeled as one or more discrete plane wave fronts but is actually continuous over some finite but narrow region. Consequently, if a single reference hydrophone is used, only a single null is generated which cannot completely suppress the extended interference source, particularly, if the interference source extent is large compared to the width of the null. Thus, as additional reference hydrophones are added to the LMS canceller structure, more nulls can be directed toward the interference improving the cancellation but never completely cancelling the interference. However, as the nulls become closely spaced over the interference extent, additional reference hydrophones will not improve cancellation significantly. Thus, since each additional reference is costly in terms of computations in the adaptive algorithm, there is a tradeoff between computational cost and cancellation performance. Moreover, since algorithm noise is proportional to the number of references, a small improvement in cancellation resulting from the addition of references may actually be offset by the increased algorithm noise. Furthermore, when the target is located within the surface reverberation extent, the target signal as well as the interference will be suppressed, thus making it very difficult to detect such a target. One approach to cancellation of surface reverberation noise is reported in Sea Surface Reverberation Rejection , W.S. Hodgkiss et al., IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, 19 21 March, 1984, ICASSP 84 Proceedings, San Diego, California US . A discussion of cancellation of multipath interference appears in Adaptive Array Cancellation of Multipath Interference , D.R. Morgan et al., IEEE Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, 19 21 March, 1984 ICASSP 84 Proceedings, San Diego, California US . It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an active sonar system adapted to detect the presence of a low doppler target located within the convergence zone of the sonar in the presence of surface reverberation noise. According to the present invention there is provided an active sonar system adapted to detect a target in a sonar convergence zone CZ in the presence of surface reverberation, comprising primary receiving transducer means adapted to provide primary signals, reference receiving transducer means spatially separated from the primary transducer means and adapted to provide reference signals, and sonar processor means coupled to the primary and reference transducer means for processing the primary and reference signals, characterized in that the reference transducer means is spatially separated from the primary transducer means by a sufficient distance that surface reverberation components of the primary and reference transducer signals are substantially uncorrelated, and further the sonar processor means is responsive to the primary and reference transducer signals to detect a target in the presence of the surface reverberation and comprises means for exploiting the correlation properties of the respective primary and reference signals so as to detect the presence of a target submerged in the sonar convergence zone. The various objects, features and advantages of the disclosed invention will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art from the following detailed disclosure when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawing, wherein FIG. 1 is an illustration representing the source distribution and array geometry for the far field extended source model of the surface reverberation FIGS. 2a 2d are graphs depicting the spatial characterization of an extended source and a point source FIG. 3 is a block diagram of the preferred embodiment and FIG. 4 is a block diagram illustrating frequency domain implementation of the predictor structure. The invention is directed to a technique for processing against surface reverberation from the convergence zone hereinafter also referred to as CZ in an active sonar. When attempting to detect a low doppler, submerged target in the CZ, the backscatter of the transmitted waveform from the surface above the target is usually the limiting source of background noise. The reverberation energy is nonstationary, functionally dependent on the signal even though the back scatter is statistically uncorrelated with the signal , and spatially extended over the sector of the CZ annulus cut by the transmitter azimuth beamwidth. For typical submarine targets, and at frequencies and power levels of typical surface ship sonars, the signal to reverberation ratio can be expected to vary from 0 dB to 20 dB at the beam outputs. In a basic form, the invention involves bistatic or multistatic operation, wherein one or more reference hydrophones, spatially separated from the primary transmit receive array of the sonar, are used to suppress the surface reverberation noise in the primary array output. This is accomplished using a Least Mean Square LMS adaptive multiple canceller structure configured as an adaptive spatial predictor. In previous work in the open literature, the canceller has been used to suppress point sources of interference in the beamformer output, and in other work by the present inventor, has been applied to the cancellation of the extended source of interference in the CZ. For a target disposed in the same angular region in the primary sonar array beam as the reverberation, the canceller structure will suppress the target signal as well as the reverberation. One aspect of the present invention comprises the modification of such a canceller structure to form a predictor, in order to be able to detect the target which spatially overlays the reverberation. The critical behavior employed by the invention is that the correlation for the return waveforms of the extended source at the respective sensors drops off with increasing distance between the reference and primary sensors, while it stays a constant for the plane wave target return. The detection of the target is based on one strong target point source within a densely packed region of weak point sources, whose sum is much larger than the target. For purposes of analysis, several models of the surface reverberation behavior have been developed, and there is some sensitivity to the choice of cross correlation model. One effective model of the surface reverberation or extended source comprises many independent radiators densely packed over the reflecting surface. Strictly limiting the sonar extent over a small angular region produces a cross spectral density hereinafter also referred to as CSD whose magnitude varies with hydrophone separation in a sin x x function. The basic far field extended source model was developed for the particular sonar array geometry shown in FIG. 1. In this geometry, an integral number N of reference sensors are configured in a uniformly spaced line array and are used to cancel the extended source interference from the output of a primary sensor placed colinear with the reference array. The extended interference is assumed to be distributed in a plane containing the line array, as shown in FIG. 1. The energy arriving from any angle In most cases of interest, the primary sensor will not be a single omni directional hydrophone but an array of hydrophones steered in some particular direction. Analysis has shown that when the primary array is replaced by a single directional hydrophone, the same statistics for the reference and primary inputs result if In Equation 1, a FIG. 2a is a graph illustrating the angular energy distribution of a point source as a function of angular displacement from the primary array centerline. FIG. 2c is a similar plot illustrating the angular distribution resulting from an extended source. The magnitude of the cross spectral density between two sensors as a function of sensor spacing d is plotted in FIGS. 2b and 2d for the point source and the extended source, respectively. The CSD function shown for the extended source is the sin x x function developed for the model as discussed above. As the sensors are moved apart, the energy from the extended source tends to become less correlated. The CSD of a point source may be viewed as the cross correlation at a single frequency between the outputs of two sensors separated by the distance parameter d on the horizontal axis. The magnitude of the CSD for the plane wave signal is a constant with sensor separation, as one would expect for energy from a point source. The present invention exploits these physical properties by extracting the correlation properties of the target signal present and signal absent cases. There are various alternate configurations to perform this kind of correlation extraction function. Since the signal and the extended source differ in their spatial correlation function, some form of correlator processor will be inherent in all the possible configurations. An implementation employing a correlator would first require bandpass filtering to the bandwidth of a doppler bin in the active sonar, and frequency shifting down to baseband. The square of the magnitude of the time averaged correlator output forms the test statistic. Thus, in the absence of a target return signal, a certain spatial correlation exists between the energy received at the reference hydrophone and the primary array. When the signal appears, this correlation increases, and that difference is used as the test statistic. A preferred implementation of the predictor system employs an adaptive filter. Among the reasons for using an adaptive filter predictor rather than the correlator implementation outline above is that, in practice, the correlator may be sensitive to certain parameters and conditions assumed to be known, but which are really unknown. For example, the signal portion of the return has unknown arrival time and duration. The correlator needs to be properly gated on and off to take advantage of the signal present intervals, or else its performance degrades. The adaptive filter on the other hand, learns that the signal is present with a different time constant than its change after the signal turns off. Its gating for synchronization with the target return to detect the target is less sensitive. The adaptive filter is driven by a measured reference waveform and automatically converges to the correct phase shift to provide maximum signal response. There are other factors, such as target dynamics which the adaptive filter can track and unknown reverberation spectra due to the surface spreading which the adaptive filter automatically estimates and pre whitens . All of these considerations tend to weigh in favor of the adaptive filter implementation. A sonar system employing a multiple canceller configuration is shown in block diagram form in FIG. 3. The system comprises a primary sensor 100, which in the preferred embodiment consists of an active hydrophone array. While the hyrophone array may be active, it is not necessary that the transmit array be disposed at the same location as the primary sensor array. For purposes of the invention, the sonar transmitter may be disposed at a different location than the primary receive sensor. Reference sensors 120, 130, which comprise hydrophones in the preferred embodiment, are spatially separated from the primary sensor 100. In general, N reference hydrophones may be employed, although as discussed below, the preferred embodiment utilizes a single reference sensor. The output of the reference sensors 120, 130 are respectively coupled to adaptive filters 125, 135. In the preferred embodiment, each filter employs Least Mean Square LMS algorithm. Such filters are well known to those skilled in the art, and have been extensively discussed in the literature, such as for example, Time Delay Estimation Using the LMS Adaptive Filter, P. Feintuch, F. Reed, N. Berchad, The outputs of the LMS adaptive filters 125, 135 are combined at summing device 105 to form a composite filter output, which composite signal is inverted and then summed with the output of the primary sensor at summer 110. The output of the summing device 110 comprises the cancelled sonar output. The cancelled output comprises an error signal which is in turn fed back to the adaptive filter to control the tap coefficient values, as is well known to those skilled in the art. The output of summing device 105 is also coupled to detector device 140. This process can also be implemented in the frequency domain as will subsequently be described in more detail with reference to FIG. 5. In order to cancel a waveform, it must be correlated between the reference hydrophones and the primary sensor usually a beam steered to the target . Thus, when the interest is in cancelling the extended interference, the reference hydrophones are clustered close to the primary. This preserves high correlation at the inputs to the canceller, allowing the canceller to respond to the strong interference, producing a spatial notch in its direction. Although this correlation approach removes the interference, and allows detection of the signal if it is outside of the interference angle, it does not fully exploit the received information. Since a solution to the signal detection problem cannot rely on separate energy arrival angles, it must use other statistical ways in which the signal and the interference differ. For detection rather than cancellation, one must operate in a region that exploits the difference between the statistics under the signal present and signal absent cases. The target signal remains spatially correlated at large sensor spacings, while the interference correlation decreases. The objective is therefore to operate at large rather than small spacings between the primary and reference sensors, for which the surface reverberation is decorrelated by the distance, while the signal correlation is preserved. The processor is then asked to respond to the correlated signal, when it appears, and to reject the essentially uncorrelated reverberation which is always present. Thus, the processor is predicting the signal correlation rather than cancelling on the interference. The processor structure for this predictor operation is similar to the canceller structure except that the filter output is used for detection rather than the error output, and the reference sensors are spaced far from the primary sensor. Then, under normal conditions of surface reverberation in the absence of signal, very little correlation exists between the references and the primary, and the filter does not respond, i.e., on the average it passes nothing. The error, or cancelled, waveform is essentially the primary alone since there was no correlated energy to cancel, and the filter output is very small. When the signal appears, it represents a correlated component between the references and the primary. The least mean square adaptive filter will try to pass this component so that it can remove it from the primary and thus reduce the power in the error waveform. It responds to the signal, causing the filter output to increase and thus allowing the signal to be detected. The structure of signal detector 140 need not be described in detail, since detectors are well known to those skilled in the art. By way of example only, the filter output may be provided to a square law detector, in turn coupled to a threshold decision device. It is noted that this is a direct analogy to the temporal predictor that can be used to detect a tone in broadband noise, called a line enhancer. As with the line enhancer, there are implementation questions of convergence time, algorithm noise, steady state response, and number of references. Simulations were performed using a computer model of CZ reverberations as an extended source. These simulations indicated that substantial improvements in the detection probability were possible when the reference was placed such that the reverberation correlation between reference and primary outputs was small. A key simulation result was that, in all cases, use of more than one reference provided little improvement over a single reference and could even degrade performance via algorithm noise. The single reference predictor structure was analyzed in both steady state and transient cases by means of a frequency domain model, as is discussed in more detail below. The simulations appear to be in agreement with the analytical performance predictions. The steady state performance predictions provide an upper bound on the detection probability obtainable in a given situation i.e., for a given CSD between sensors, signal to reverberation ratio, and adaptive time constant , as well as providing a good estimate of performance when sufficient signal samples exist for the filter to converge. The steady state performance is always improved by reducing the value of the adaptive feed back coefficient µ giving the filter a longer time constant . Assuming that the target is in the CZ for at least 12 pings, allowing ping to ping integration of 12 detector outputs, it was shown that reasonable steady state detection probabilities can only be obtained if where P and will therefore require very long time constants for small signal to reverberation ratios. Since the number of samples of signal may be limited by the transmitted pulse length, it will be desirable to increase µ somewhat to obtain more rapid convergence, sacrificing some steady state detection probability. However, the detection probability after n signal samples or at steady state obtained by increasing µ from µ₁ to µ₂ will always be less than the steady state detection probabilities associated with µ₁. Using typical CZ scattering strengths and target strengths it appears that reasonable signal to reverberation ratios are on the order of 0 to 15 dB. The steady state detection results show that useful performance gains can be obtained for signal to reverberation ratios in the range if Equation 2 is met and if the reference hydrophone can be placed so as to obtain normalized cross spectral density According to both exponential and sinx x models for the CSD, such values for ρ can be obtained for very practical spacings of the sensors. Use of distances between sensors of 20 to 100 feet were used to obtain such values of ρ in the simulations. Use of one reference not only simplifies the processing required to implement the adaptive predictor, it allows analysis of the predictor for arbitrary CSD in closed form. This analysis uses a frequency domain implementation, illustrated in block diagram form in FIG. 4, of the adaptive filter in which both the primary and reference outputs are Fast Fourier Transformed hereinafter also referred to as FFT prior to adaptive filtering. As shown in FIG. 4, each input is decomposed into frequency lines, using a discrete Fourier transform such as the FFT, and then on each bin the same cancellation structure as in FIG. 3 is performed. The adaptive filter reduces in this case to a Single Complex Tap which is updated with the complex LMS algorithm. The error outputs are used in the LMS algorithm for their associated frequencies. This decoupling of the feedback errors makes the algorithm significantly more efficient to implement in digital hardware. More specifically, the output in each FFT bin is processed by a Single Complex Tap adaptive predictor. The statistics of the single tap adaptive filter output can be determined using the method described in Analysis of the Frequency Domain Adaptive Filter, It will of course be understood that the present invention has been described above purely by way of example, and that modifications of detail can be made within the scope of the invention.
