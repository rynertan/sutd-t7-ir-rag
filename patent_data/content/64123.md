## Description
Description of the invention entitled AEROBALÃŒSTIC DEVICE FOR SEPARATING THE COMPONENTS OF PRE, TREATED SOLID URBAN WASTES in the nnme of DANECO Danieli Ecologia S. p.A. at Buttrio submitted on under No. This invention concerns an aeroballistic device for separating the hard components of pre treated solid urban waste. To be more exact, the invention concerns an aerobal . listic device for separating the hard components of pre treated solid urban waste and deals in particular with the separation of glass, hard bodies, tin plate, cans and simil. ar and like objects and materials. Khen dealing with waste, and in particular with solid urban waste, after the pre treatment and separation of fer . rous materials it is of fundamental importance to be able to separate the organ component from other materials deemed to.be pollutants of said component. In particular, the materials deemed to be pollutants of the organic component are, for instance glass and hard bodies in general chinaware, pottery,sto nes, and so on non ferrous tin plate and cans. The device of the invention provides for a vibrating feeder means which arranges to feed the material evenly onto throwing head means. The material to be divided into the various components consists of organic matter and other heavy or magnetic bo dies in the waste. Said material to be divided is thrown into a chamber having a bottom consisting of hoppers to gather the various materials sorted. On the wall. substantially opposite to that from which the material is thrown, fan means are advantageously locat ed which blow a jet of air in the opposite direction to that of the motion of the material thrown. The air blown inside the chamber can be re aspirated by said fan means, from the atone lying below the intake of the material, through separator means. In this way it is possible to avoid the escape of the processing air outside the machine and the formation of pol luting or smelly fluid currents in the surroundings. The material thrown has a given energy proportional fo its mass and to the square of the throwing speed, and this energy is partly dissipated by the drag of an aerody namic nature which the material undergoes. Aerodynamic drag is increased by the presence of the jet of air blown in the opposite direction. Owing to their differing ratios of the product of the. coefficient of aerodynamic drag multiplied by resistant section versus their mass, the various materials drop into the throwing chamber at various distances from the throw ing point. It is possible in this way to separate them. Indeed, the organic matter which has a high ratio of the product of the coefficient of aerodynamic drag multipl. ied by resistant section versus its mass, drops into the zone nearest to the throwing head, whereas glass and hard bodies have a longer traJectory. Thus tt is possible to gather In the hoppers, besides a modest quantity of pollutants, the following components organic matter non ferrous cans and tin plate glass and the like hard bodies. Furthermore, it is possible to gather in a separator any dusty material or material with a very low ratio of the product of the coefficient of aerodynamic drag multiplied by resistant section versus mass. The device of the invention enables the following ad vantages to be obtained separation of the various components of the material ar riving on the basis of their mass and the product of the coefficient of aerodynamic drag multiplied by resistant section minimization of the energy required for the separation as compared to other systems such as air classifiers . the ability to separate a differentiated range of homoge neous materials by interposing several interception screens by by using a jet of air blown in the opposite direction to that of the motion of the material thrown, to make the overall whole of the device much more compact than a simple throwing type classifier. The invention is therefore embodied in an aeroballistic device for separating the components of pre treated solid urban waste, whereby said device consists of a container having at its bottom a plurality of gathering hoppers and is characterized by comprising in mutual cooperation and co ordination throwing head means, fan means cooperating with said throwing head means by blowing a current of air towards them and separator means lying below said throwing head means, whereby adjustable screen means are advantageously included and there are also means for recirculation of air. Hereinafter we shall describe a preferential embodiment of the invention as a non restrictive example, at the same time making references to the attached table, which gives q side view of the device. The device of the invention consists of a vibrating feeder means 10 which arranges to dose the material II even ly onto the throwing head means 12.Said throwing head means 12 consist essentially, in this instance, of a high speed conveyor belt IS provided with ridges 14 or incorporated scoops for conveying and throwing the material II. The slope of the throwing head means 12 can be inchange able or variable, that is to say, the tangent angle of the throw can be fixed or variable. The material II to be separated into the various com ponents includes organic matter and other heavy or magnetic bodies normally to be found in waste. The material II is hurled into a chamber 15 with side walls 16 parallel to or inclined in relation to each other. and with a bottom consisting of hoppers 17 to gather the various components sorted. On the wall IS opposite to that from which the material is thrown 19 there are positioned fan means 20 which serve to send a jet of air in the opposite direction to that of the motion of the material thrown. The air thus blown inside the chamber 15 is re aspirated advantageously by the same fan means 20 from the zone 21 be. low the intake of the material II. The aspiration takes place advatageously through cyclone type separator means 22 or an equivalent type. The outlet 23 of the separator means 22 Is connected tn this case to the aspiration 24 of the fan means 20 with suitable ducts. Beans for replacing any air lost can be envisaged. In this way any appreciable escape of processing air out of the device with the formation, in the neighbourhood, of fluid currents that might be tOI C or smelly is prevented. The material thrown II possesses a given energy which, as said earlier, is in proportion to its mass and to the square of the throwing speed said inertial energy Is dis sipated partly by the aerodynamic drag which the material undergoes and partly by the presence of said opposing jet of air blown by the fan means 20. Owing to their varying ratios the various components III 2I1 3TI 4I1 fall into the throwing chamber at various distances from the throwing point itself, and their separat ion is made possible for this reason. Organic material III which has a high ratio of the product of the coefficient of drag multiplied by resistant section versus mass falls into the zone nearest to the throw ing head means 12, whereas glass and hard bodies 211 311 have a lc per trajectory. Dusty material 411 or material having a very low ratio is, instead, gathered by the separator means 22. By means of the hoppers I7 and of the screens 25, which are ad van tageously adjustable, it is possible to gather the following components besides a small quantity of pollutants. organic matter III in the hopper I7, non ferrous cans and tin plate 211 in the hopper II7, . glass and like hard bodies 311 in the hopper 217, dusty material 411 separated in the separator means 22 and collected at 317. ge have described here a device according to the in vention, but variants are possible. Thus,it is possible to vary the proportions and sizes, and parts can be added or removed It is possible to replace the axial fan with a centrifugal fan it is possible to envisage the throwing head.means 12 as having an adjustable speed the fan means 20 can be envisaged as having a range and or capacity which can be varied and regulated as wished it is possible to slope the jet of air of the fan means as required the throwing head means 12 can also consist of wheels with scoops or can be of a windmill type or can consist of other like or eguiva ent means, and so on. These and other variants are all possible for a technician in this field within the scope of the idea of the solution.
