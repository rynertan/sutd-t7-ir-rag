# Harness making apparatus having improved wire lengthening means.

## Abstract
Harness making apparatus having improved wire leng thening means. Apparatus comprises a wire feed shuttle 20 having telescoping wire guide tubes 25 and a wire clamp ing mechanism 130 . The shuttle 20 delivers the leading ends of wires 4 first to a press 14 for application of terminals then delivers the terminated leading ends to a connector block loading station for insertion in a connector block 7 . The clamping mechanism 130 is then released and the shuttle 20 retreats over the wires 4 along a feed path extending between the block loading station and a wire severing station. A comb like deflector 50 with arcuate channels 52 then moves onto the wires between the shuttle 20 and the loaded connector block 7 . An axial wire feeder 10 located upstream of the severing station then pays out the wire through the shuttle 20 into loops of various lengths between the loaded connector block 7 and the deflector 50 . The shuttle 20 then retreats on the feed path to a point between the severing station and the wire feeder 10 and the wires are severed to produce a harness 6 having wires 7 of varying length.
