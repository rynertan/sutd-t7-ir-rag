## Description
Energy Counter Measuring System The present invention refers to an energy counter measuring system. Crrently for the energy transition balance, heat centrals and distribution systems are normally equipped with EPC s Energy Pulse Counters which totalize the energy produced by each group of these centrals or the energy transmitted by each distribution line. The object of the invention is to proportion novel equipments to replace current EPC s, which comply with current nornatives, thereby generating a completely automatized and centralized energy control system. The system of the invention employs the said EEC s, that is to say, pulse sensors generators which com municate with a series of microprocessor based autonomous stations, cenfigured in such a manner that they can be interconnected via a communications channel to form a branched ype radial network. At the apex of this hierarchical pyramid of the network, there is a multiplexor assembly which enables the measurements of the different remote terminals to be made in a centralized manner, configured so as to be compatible with currently employed energy control systems or with any other alternative management means. Further, this invention proportions the abili ty Df equipping a concentrator with a module for automati caZly calling the switched network of a particular distri burin company for examp le that of Empresa Nacional de Eltricidad, S.A. , including the detection of tones and en.lDling linking to the remote terminals via the existing network In this manner, and as already indicated, with the present invention it will be possible to locally become aware of the energy transition balance at the different stations and centrals, and to also become aware of the balance of a plurality of branched points at a concentration point. The features for solving the object of the invention appear from the claims. The invention will be better understood from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which, illustratively but not limiting Figure 1 is a block diagram of the internal ar chiDectwre of an energy counter terminal, In accordance wltn the invention, Figure 2 is a block diagram of the internal architecture of the terminal concentrator station. Figure 3 is the structure of the EPC energy pulse counter devices. Figure 4 is the basic functional organisatlon of a counter register, connected or not to the RBU, with the option of individual remote register. Figure 5 is a variation of a counter acquisition autonomous network, connected or not to the RBU. Referring to the said drawings and particularly to figure 1, it can be seen that the energy counter measuring system, in accordance with the invention, comprises a plurality of terminals, the internal structure of which is precisly shown in this figure 1. These terminals have two interconnected processors, one of which is the master processor 1 and the other constitutes the slave processor 2 which is reserved to perform auxiliary tasks. Operation of these processors is controlled by the program existing in a memory block 3. The terminal in question has the following peripheral elements Operational keyboard 4 comprising both a functional as well as a numerical keyboard from which operation of the terminal is interactively programmed, and from which operational status information can be requested.This keyboard 4 has an alphabet graphics introduction process to insert assignation headings into the various counters. As a support for this keyboard 4 and, in general, for displaying messages, there is provided a visual display means 5 formed of twelve electroluminescent diode type alphanumeric characters. The twenty character printer 6 is a device adjoining the equipment and records the initialisation program, the possible changes therein a posteriori , afld hourly reflects the different alarms managed by the system. Further, any recordal made is accompanied by the date and hour at which it is produced. The master processor 1 is connected to an input s ab ,yste 7 which is comprised of various cards for elec trically conditioning the various signals from the pulse emi ting relays, by means of which the energy counting is mangled This signal conditioning, naturally, involves the galvanic isolation of the system from the signals. This input sub system 7 is capable of accepting a total of 256 counter input channels. Further, the master processor 1 controls the communications interface 8 with the RTU, which receives information from the watch dog device, as well as the commands for the parallel transference of the information. As indicated, the input sub system 7 receives the input channels 9, whereas the communications interface 8 is provided with the data and command transmitting channels 10 and 11, respectively. A further comnunications interface 12 has been provided for establishing a link with the switched net won via the subscriber line 13. The card 14 will establish four commun cation lines, preferably according to standard V.24, which is controlled by the master processor 1 of the terminal. Each of these four communication lines performs the following Line 15 is a connection line to a local printer, having preferably an 80 character format, which is capable of ting the hour protocols of the energy counters and those lists requested by the system operator. Via line 16 is established a magnetic taped storage output, according to a format determined by the user, in which the energy counter data will be stored with hourly periodicities. Line 17 consists of a connection for a standard V.24 modern enabling linking to the concentrator terminal, which will be described subsequently. Finally, line 18 determines an output for connection to a remote register terminal into which can be connected a modem since it has a standard V.24 interface. Block 19 consists of a quartz driven, batteryoperated clock calendar system. The clock system starts off with the initialisation process of the system chronometrically, that is, starting takes place at a precise moment by depressing a key and it will be resynchronised with the RTU requests, if any, assaying on the contrary the hour responsibility. It must be pointed out that the data of this clock calendar 19 can be modified at the request of the concentrator terminal, arbitrating in this manner a renote correcting procedure of any hour shift produced over prolonged periods of time. Further, the calendar takes into account the differences in days of the months and the leap years, and is autonomous of the general supply of the equipment for a period of 15 days. The communications interface for the switched network 12 has a circuit for detecting a call and coupling to the subscriber line 13. It further incorporates a low velocity modem which can operate in a recut band at two kilocycles, enabling the counter data to be communicated via this line and the remote admissions from the blocks o the repetition requests thereof, in case of error, to be received. The organization of these terminals is com leted with the block 20 comprising an assembly of real time markers, from the battery sub system 21 and from the slpoly sub syste i 22.

Block 34 represents the RTU whereas block 35 represents the general oontrol centre. Each of the described terminals, according to the preceding structure, can be connected to up to 256 simple pulse counters and 16 multiple counters. A simple counter is defined as that which has an associated input point, counting the pulses received therefrom. On the contrary, a multiple counter is defined as that which has up to 16 associated input points, adding or substracting the pulses from each of them. According to the foregoing, the local operator of one terminal of the system could, by operating the keyboard 4, request the following information Actual date and hour of the internal clock. Display of the number of pulses received up to that moment on the visual display means 5.

Figure 2 of the accompanying drawings illustrate the internal architecture of the concentrator terminal comprising a specialised communicating terminal having a functional and numerical keyboard 36 similar to that of thi previously described terminal, although its functionality is adapted to the specific behaviour of this concentrator terminal. As in the case of the energy pulse counter terminals, this concentrator terminal has a dual processor structure, comprising the master processor 37 and the slave processor 38. This concentrator terminal has up to eight com muication channels 391 ... 398 according to standard V. 4, which permits the branched output for different phisical lines and different transmission speeds, program muzzle by electrical bridges in their component card. The numerical and functional keyboard 36 includes a visual display means having twelve alphanumeric characters which will serve for programming the equipments and its subsequent operation. A printer 40 is controlled by the slave processor 38 for supporting the interactive programming and recordal of the communication alarms. The master processor also controls an automatic diallIng channel 60 compatible both with the switched tele phone network as ell 1 as with a particular telephone net a or , admitting up to 18 dialling numbers with intermediate tone waits. Linking with the subscriber number is desig nated by 41. There is also provided an output channel 42 for connection to a printer, in standard V. 24. The channel 43 controls the communications in the standard V.24 SCE systern, and there are also provided two standard V.24 channels 44 and 45 for other possible uses to be determined by the user. Block 46 determines a clock calendar system operated by the block of batteries 47. Facing all the communication channels there is a block of modems 48 capable of being linked to eight branches of the counter system and having phonic and supraphonic band links, generically designated by block 49. Figure 4 of the accompanying drawings illustrates the basic structure of a counter register assembly connected to the RTU or not, with option of individual remote register, in accordance with the system of the inven tion.
