# Electroplating arrangements.

## Abstract
An electroplating arrangement having particular use in the manufacture of stamper plates for disc record production comprises a rectangular plating path 1 , one side wall 2 being non vertical with respect to the bath base 12 . A filter screen 10 divides the bath into an anode region and a cathode region, the regions including anode and cathode electrode arrangements respectively 3, 7 . A stamper plate not shown to be plated is mounted on the cathode electrode arrangement which is connected to a motor 9 capable of rotating the arrangement about an axis perpendicular to the plate. The anode arrangement compris es an elongate porous bag 3 containing anode material 5 and is disposed parallel to the cathode arrangement and non vertical wall. An electrolyte input pipe 13 extends through the bag and screen to lie opposite the mounted stamper plate directing inflowing electrolyte thereat. An output exit 11 is disposed within the anode region on the bath base such that the anode arrangement lies within the flowpath from said entrance to said exit.
