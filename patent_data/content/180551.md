# AN AGRICULTURAL MACHINE FOR BREAKING AND OVERTURNING THE SOIL

## Abstract
A subsoiler machine that in one single passage breaks and overturns the soil in its surface by means of concave overturning disks 4 and breaks the soil in depth by means of subsoiler points 7 placed immediately behind each disk 4, and that helps diminishing the tractive effort necessary for the advancing thereof by means of the rotatory movement of said disks.
