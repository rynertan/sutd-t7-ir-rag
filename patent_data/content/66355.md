# SWINGING LINK MECHANISM

## Abstract
A swinging link mechanism for connecting a prime mover to a rigid trailer comprises an upper 2a, 2b and lower 1a, 1b opposed pairs of laterally spaced mountings, the lower pair for attachment to the prime mover and the upper pair for connection to the trailer. A swinging link 5a, 5b pivotally connects each respective two opposed mountings. The two links are inclined toward one another. The spacing of the lower pair of mountings 1a, 1b to be attached to the prime mover exceeds the spacing of the upper pair 2a, 2b to be connected to the trailer. The mechanism is particularly for semi articulated tankers and allows for twisting of the semi trailer relative to the prime mover.
