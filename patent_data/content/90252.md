# Process and furnace for making silicon carbide.

## Abstract
There is provided a method of making a larger percen tage of coarsely crystalline silicon carbide in an Acheson furnace comprising packing the silica and coke ingredients forming a reaction mix around a centrally disposed heat source 14 , confining the mix between gates 22, 24 which hold the mix in an insulated zone 20 surrounding said source 14 , supplying energy to said source 14 for raising the temperature within the mass to at least about 1800 C for reacting all of the ingredients in the mix between the heat source 14 and the gates 22, 24 to form finely crystalline silicon carbide, and then increasing the crystal size of the silicon carbide in the reacted mass by increasing the tem perature of the reacted mass between the heat source 14 and the gates 22, 24 to a temperature between 2000 C to 2500 C.
