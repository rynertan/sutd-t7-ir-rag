# Transfer sheets and production of decorative articles therewith.

## Abstract
A transfer sheet comprising a releasable substrate 1 and a heat formable pattern 3 , and preferably a further foaming inhibiting pattern 5 formed thereon is prepared, and these pattern are transferred onto a foamable resin layer 2 such as a polyvinyl chloride plastisol containing a blowing agent. The entire structure is heated, whereupon there is obtained a decorative article in which a resin layer 7a , as a whole, has foamed, and at the same time, at the parts where the foamable resin pattern has been transferred, projecting convex parts 3a are formed by the forming of the heat foamable pattern, while depressed concave parts 5a are formed at parts onto which the foaming inhibiting pattern has been transferred.
