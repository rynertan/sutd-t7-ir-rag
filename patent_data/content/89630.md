# Device for measuring oxygen concentration in exhaust gas.

## Abstract
An oxygen concentration measuring device for measuring oxygen concentration in exhaust gas from a combustor, wherein the oxygen concentration in the exhaust gas is made through comparison with a reference value which is obtained through detection of oxygen concentration in the atmosphere, either by creating the same condition as the atmosphere in the exhaust pipe through temporarily interrupting tne fuel supply to the combustor or by temporarily introducing the atmosphere directly into the exhaust pipe. The use of the oxygen concentration in the atmosphere as the reference value permits an accurate measurement of oxygen conentration in the exhaust gas for a long period of time regardless of extent of contamination of the detector element by contaminants suspended by the exhaust gas.
