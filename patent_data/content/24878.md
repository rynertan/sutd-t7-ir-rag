# Phase locked loop circuit.

## Abstract
A phase locked loop circuit comprising a reference oscil lator 1 , a reference frequency divider 2 for dividing the output signal of the reference oscillator, a programmable frequency divider 3 , a phase comparator 4 for monitoring the difference in phase between the output signal of the two frequency dividers, a lock detector 11 for generating a first signal which is pulse shaped or rectangular when a difference in phase is detected, and a digital signal maintaining circuit 100 for converting the first signal into a second, direct cur rent, signal.
