## Abstract
An aqueous release coating composition comprising a perfluorinated ester polymer and a film forming polymer is described.

## Description
RELEASE COATING COMPOSITIONSPressure sensitive tapes with paper hacking have found extensive use in the masking, labelling, and packaging fields. To be useful, the paper tapes should be easily unwound from the roll on which it is sold. Ready unwind is most frequently accomplished by applying to the tape backing on the back side, i.e., on the side opposite to that bearing the adhesive, a coating containing release agent The release coating for the back side, often called backsize , may be of a film forming polymer which of itself has release properties as described in U.S.Patent 2,607,711, or of a film forming polymer which contains a release agent and obtained by applying a filmforming composition comprising a film forming polymer film former and a release agent in an organic solvent such as described in U.S. Patent 3,502,497. However, for practical considerations, including economy, pollution control and the like, it is desirable to have a backsize composition applicable to paper backings from an aqueous dispersion. Although polytetrafluoroethylene films when used as backing per se as described in U.S. 2,824,026 Reissue 241,953 U.S. 2,765,241 and Canada 657,508 release verp easily from pressure sensitive adhesive, the use of polytetrafluoroethylene as a release agent dispersed in a water based film forming composition and applied to paper backings has not provided a satisfactory backsize.Other fluorinated compounds such as described in U.S. 3,318,852 3,690,924 3,773,538 4,171,397 and Australian 225,372 have not been entirely satisfactory. One water based backsize described in U.S. 3,067,057, consisting of waterbased film forming polymers and a sulfated or sulfonated wetting agent as release agent, although somewhat successful in some systems, has drawbacks including fugitiveness of release agent and absorption of the release agent by the adhesive on aging. Thus, it is desirable to provide an effective waterdispersed backsize composition.According to the present invention, it has been discovered that certain perfluorinated ester polymers in water dispersion may be combined with various water based filmforming polymer compositions to produce a water based release coating composition which is suitable as backsize for pressure sensitive adhesive tapes, especially for those having a porous backing such as kraft paper backing.The perfluorinated ester polymers are homopolymers and copolymers of os perfluoroalkyl alkyl acrylate. By perfluoroalkyl alkyl is meant a structure which may be represented as RF CnH2n wherein Rf represents a perfluoroalkyl group. The perfluoroalkyl group may have from about 3 to 12 carbon atoms and the alkylene chain also may have from about 3 to 12 carbon atoms. When the pqlymers are copolymers, the comonomer may be a non acrylate ester such as, for example, vinyl acetate. Suitable perfluorinated ester polymers have a fluorine content in the range of from about 30 to 50 percent. Polymer compositions are available commercially as aqueous dispersions which may contain polymerizable monomers and or polymerizable or cross linkable oligomers.The most suitable polymer compositions are available commercially as aqueous dispersions for use in treating fabrics to provide waterproofing and stain resistance. Two most useful commercially available water dispersed perfluorinated ester polymer compositions are Scotchban FC 824 40 solids having a fluorine content of about 40 and available from 3H Company and Zonal0 NWK 25 solids having a fluorine content of about 38 and available fromE.I. duPont.Company. Suitable perfluorinated ester polymers include those described in U.S. 3,102,103.Water based film forming polymer compositions which are suitable for preparing the release coating compositions includes melamine formaldehye composition, vinyl acetate latex, carboxylated vinyl acetate ethylene terpolymer latex, water reducible alkyd, water reducible acrylic latex and the like. Most of the suitable film forming polymer compositions are available commercially undervarious trade names. Thus, a suitable vinyl acetate latex may be obtained as National Starch 78 3730, from NationalStarch carboxylated vinyl acetate ethylene terpolymer latex may be obtained as Airflex 416A, from Air Products water reducible alkyd may be obtainable as Doresco AKW5 1 from Dock Resins water reducible acrylic latex may be obtainable as Doresco ACW7,1 from Dock Resins.The perfluorinated ester polymer composition release agent may be employed in the film forming compositions in amounts of from about 0.5 to 3 percent dry weight of release agent per dry weight of film forming polymer to obtain release coating compositions. The release coating composition also may include such materials as clay or silica to provide shingling or pigment to improve appearance or confer additional properties.The tape backing contemplated for the use of the backsize release coating composition of the present invention is paper. Thus, the backing is quite porous in nature and normally will have been or will be saturated with latex or solvent based saturant to improve the internal properties of the paper. The treated paper then is coated on the backsize with the release coating composition at a dry coating weight of from about 0.2 to 0.4 ounce per square yard and thereafter dried and fluxed at temperatures in the range of from about 2500 to 3500 F. The opposite surface of the paper then is coated with any conventional pressure sensitive adhesive. Representative adhesives may be rubber based adhesives, or may be acrylate based adhesives. Rubber based adhesives maybe based on natural rubber, synthetic rubber such as styrenebutadiene rubber, A B A block copolymer rubber or other rubbers compounded with the appropriate tackifier for pressure sensitive adhesives. Suitable representative pressure sensitive adhesives are those which may be found in Handbook of Adhesives edited by Irving Skeist, VanNostrand Reinhold Company, 1962, particularly in the chapter entitled Pressure Sensitive Tapes and Labels byC.W. Bemmels, pages 724 735. Flat paper tapes normally are coated with adhesive at a rate of from about 1 to 1.5 ounces per square yard dry weight of adhesive and crepe paper tapes are normally coated at a somewhat heavier cost of the appropriate adhesive.The following examples illustrate the invention but are not to be construed as limiting,In all the examples, the release coating composition was applied to SBR styrene butadiene rubber latex impregnated 28.5 pound crepe paper at a coating weight dry of approximately 0.25 ounce per square yard.The properties described in the examples have the following meaning.Unwind Adhesion. Force in ounces per inch of width required to unwind the tape at 150 feet per minute while drawing the end thereof radially away from a roll of the tape wound upon itself and mounted on a free turning mandrel.Quickstick. Measure of detackification determined by laying a strip of the tape on a horizontal surface and rolling a hollow plastic ball down an incline onto the tape. The vertical height from which the ball started is noted and the distance the ball rolls along the tape before coming to rest is measured. The quickstick is reported as the height in inches raised to the threehalves power, divided by the distance roll in inches. The ball made of nitrocellulose, of 1.5 inches in diameter anA 1.916 grams in weight is cleaned with petroleum ether and dried before use.Peel Adhesion. Force in ounces per inch width of tape required to remove pressure sensitive adhesive tape from a panel carried out as described in the Pressure SensitiveTape Council test procedure PSTC l.
