# MULTI LEVEL PIPELINE CONTROL STORE FOR CPU MICROSEQUENCING

## Abstract
The control store for a central processing unit is divided into two portions, a horizontal portion and a vertical portion. The vertical control store portion contains the information for the first phase of the pipeline as well as an address which is registered and used to address the horizontal control store portion which contains the second and later pipeline stage information. Multiple vertical control store portions share a common horizontal control store portion line resulting in compression.
