## Description
This invention relates to cyanoketones derived from glycyrrhetinic acid and to their preparation and use as ulcer preventing and ulcer healing agents. Carbenoxolone 13 O ss carboxypropionyl ll oxo 18ss olean 12 en 29 oic acid glycyrrhetinic acid hydrogen succinate is a known anti inflammatory agent used for gastric ulcer in the form of its disodium salt, see U.S.Pat. 3,070,623. Tolstikov Goryev and Simov, Izvestiya AkademiNauk Kazakhskoi SSR, Seriya Khimicheskaya 17, 71 78 1967 disclose the preparation of an isoxazole derivative of glycyrrhetinic acid having the formula EMI1.1 No physiological properties are disclosed for this compound. Yasue, Sakakibara and Kaiya, Yakugaku Zasshi 93, 296 299 1973 , disclose the preparation of a cyanoketone derived from oleanolic acid, said cyanoketone having the formula EMI2.1 No phy siologicAl properties are disclosed for this compound. The cleavage of isoxazoles to cyanoketones by treatment under alkaline conditions is known in steroids, see U.S. Patent 3,296,255. The invention relates to compounds of the formula EMI2.2 wherein R is hydrogen or lower alkyl, 3 lower alkanoyl enol ester thereof, or a basic salt, particularly an alkali metal salt, thereof. Pharmacological evaluation of the compounds ofFormula I has shown that they are useful in the prevention and or healing of gastric or intestinal ulcers in mammals. The invention also relates to a process for preparing a compound of Formula.I which comprises reacting a compound of the formula EMI3.1 with a strong base until the isoxazole ring has been cleaved, and acidifying the resulting salt of a compound ofFormula I. According to the present invention there is also provided a composition for the prevention and or healing of gastric or intestinal ulcers in a mammal which comprises a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of FormulaI incorporated in a pharmaceutical carrier suitable for oral administration. One can prevent and or heal gastric or intestinal ulcers in a mammal by administering orally to said mammal a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I. The compounds of Formula I are readily prepared from the commercially available glycyrrhetinic acid or its 18a isomer. The first step is an oxidation with chromic oxide to yield 18ss or 18a 3,11 dioxo olean 12 en 29 oic acid. The latter is then treated with ethyl formate in the presence of sodium methoxide in pyridine solution to afford 18B or l8a 2 hydroxymethylene 3,ll dioxo olean l2 en 29 oic acid. The hydroxymethylene derivative is reacted with hydroxylamine to produce 18B or 18a 11 oxo olean 2,l2 dieno 2,3 d isoxazd 29 oic acid of Formula II.The latter, when treated with a strong base such as an alkali metal hydroxide or alkoxide, undergoes cleavage of the isoxazole ring to form an alkali metal salt of 186 or 18a 2a cyano 3,11 dioxo olean 12 en 29 oic acid of Formula I, which is readily acidified to form the free acid. Isomerization of the 18B compounds to the 18a compounds can be effected by treatment with a strong acid at any point in the reaction sequence. The compounds of Formula I where R is lower alkyl can be prepared from the compounds where R is hydrogen by conventional esterification reactions, carried out at any point in the reaction sequence. Fischer esterification with a lower alkanol in the presence of hydrogen chloride will also isomerize the 18ss isomer to the 18a isomer. The 18B isomer can conveniently be esterified without isomerization by esterification of the free acid with a l lower alkyl 3p tolyltriazene or a diazo lower alkane or by carrying out the reaction sequence described above starting with a known lower alkyl ester of 18ss glycyrrhetinic acid. The loweralkyl group R preferably has from one to three carbon atoms. The 3 lower alkanoyl enol esters of compounds ofFormula I can be prepared by heating the latter with a loweralkanoic acid anhydride in pyridine solution. The loweralkanoyl group preferably has from two to four carbon atoms, thus being, for example, acetyl, propionyl or butyryl. The compounds of Formula I are acidic in nature and form alkali metal salts when treated with strong bases such as alkali metal hydroxides or alkoxides. Even the compounds of Formula I where R is lower alkyl are acidic because of the active hydrogen in the 2 position. Thus, in the cleavage of the isoxazole of Formula II a salt of the 2 cyano 3 oxo compound is initially produced, and said salt is converted to the free 2 cyano 3 oxo steroid by acidification. The structures of the impounds of the invention were established by the mode of preparation, elementary analysis, chromatographic procedures and infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectral determinations. Pharmacological evaluation of the compounds ofFormula I has shown that they are inhibitors of prostaglandin dehydrogenase, which is indicative of. their usefulness in the prevention and healing of gastric and intestinal ulcers. This was confirmed by studies which demonstrated that oral administration of the compounds of Formula I to rats and mice caused significant reduction in the incidence of intestinal and gastric ulcers induced by medication with indomethacin. The compounds of the invention can be prepared for use by dissolving or suspending them in aqueous medium, if necessary with the aid of emulsifying or suspending agents or by incorporating them in tablet or capsule form with conventional excipients.
