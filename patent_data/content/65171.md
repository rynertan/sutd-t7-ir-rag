# HYDRODYNAMIC LUBRICATION SYSTEM FOR PISTON DEVICES PARTICULARLY STIRLING ENGINES

## Abstract
An apparatus for effecting the lubrication of expansible chamber devices of the type having a cylinder with a piston reciprocating therein and having fluid flowing in and out of the chamber. The invention is particularly suitable for free piston Stirling engines and pumps. A torque force is applied to the piston causing it to spin sufficiently to entrain and drag along its outer surface some of the fluid in the expansible chamber so as to separate its outer surface from the wall of the cylinder.
