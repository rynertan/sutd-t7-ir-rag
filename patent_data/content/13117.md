## Description
A MOS DYNAMIC LOGIC CIRCUIT TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a MOS dynamic logic circuit. A MOS dynamic logic circuit in accordance with the present invention is applicable to circuits, such as a dynamic inverter circuit and a dynamic buffer circuit in electronic computers and the like. BACKGROUND ART A structure of a prior art MOS integrated circuit used for a static inverter is illustrated in Fig. 1 attached to the present specification. The circuit diagram of the structure of Fig. 1 is illustrated in Fig. 2 attached to the present specification. The MOS integrated circuit of Fig. 1 comprises a silicon substrate 1, N layers 21, 22, 23 formed in the upper portion of the silicon substrate 1, silicon dioxide layers 41, 42 formed on the surface of the P type silicon substrate 1 corresponding to the channel region 31 between the N layers 21 and 22 and the channel region 32 between the N layers 22 and 23, gate electrodes of polycrystalline silicon 51, 52 formed on the silicon dioxide layers 41, 42, isolation coatings 6, a conductor 71 attached to the N layer 21 and the gate electrode 51, a conductor 72 connected to the N layer 22, a conductor 73 connected to the gate electrode 52, a conductor 74 connected to the N layer 23 and field silicon dioxide layers 8.The N layer 21, the silicon dioxide layer 41the gate electrode 51 and the N layer 22 constitute a load side FET Q1 , while the N layer 22, the silicon dioxide layer 42, the gate electrode 52 and the N layer 23 constitute a driver side FET Q2. The driver side FET Q2 and the load side FET Q1 constitute a static inverter of Fig. 2. The threshold voltage of a FET is determined by the impurity concentration of the silicon substrate 1 and the thickness of silicon dioxide layers 41, 42. In the prior art MOS integrated circuit used for a static inverter, the threshold voltage Vth Q2 of the driver side FET Q2 and the threshold voltage Vth Q1 of the load side FET Q1 are of the same value of approximately 0.5 to 2. volts. 3encase of this relatively high value of the threshold voltage Vth Q1 and Vth Q2 , the operation speed of the static inverter is low, the level of the output voltage of the static inverter is low and accordingly the Noise margin of the static inverter is small Therefore, the operation characteristics of the prior art MOS integrated circuit used for logic circuits such as inverters have been unsatisfactory. A static inverter has a disadvantage of high power dissipation. In order to avoid this disadvantage a dynamic inverter is used. In a dynamic inverter, the threshold voltage of the driver side FET Q2 is required to be maintained higher than a predetermined level, because a leak current of FETs occurs even when the gate voltage is below the threshold voltage. Thus the driver side FET Q2 is required to have a threshold voltage of approximately 0.5 to 2.0 V. However, recently, short channel transistors have been widely used in order to increase the degree of integration of integrated circuit devices. In these short channel transistors, the source voltage is required to be maintained lower than a predetermined level for preventing the punch through phenomena and the break down phenomena. Under these circumstances, if the threshold voltage of the load side FET Q1 and the threshold voltage of the driver side FET Q2 are the same, both the level of the output signal and the speed of the operation are reduced.Such reductions of the level of the output signal and the speed of the operation incurs quite difficult problems. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION The present invention has been proposed in order to solve the above described problems in the prior art MOS integrated circuit used for logic circuits. The principal object of the present invention is to provide a MOS dynamic logic circuit having high operation speed, high output voltage level and accordingly a sufficientNoise margin. In accordance with the present invention, the impurity concentration of the semiconductor substrate of aMOS dynamic logic circuit is low and the local impurity concentration of the predetermined region of said semiconductor substration is controlled, so that an enhancement type field effect transistor having the low threshold voltage which controls the charging of said capacitive portion and an enhancement type field effect transistor having the high threshold voltage which controls the discharging of said capacitive portion are formed in saidMOS dynamic logic circuit. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Fig. 1 illustrates the structure of a MOS integrated circuit used for an inverter to which the present invention is to be applied Fig. 2 illustrates the circuit diagram of the MOS integrated circuit device of Fig. 1 Fig. 3 illustrates the circuit diagram of a dynamic circuit consisting of a MOS integrated circuit to which the present invention is to be applied and Fig. 4 illustrates the structure of the MOS integrated circuit device of the dynamic circuit of Fig. 3. PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION The fundamental structure of the MOS integrated circuit used for a dynamic inverter in accordance with the present invention is the stame as the structure illustrated in Fig. 1, except for the connection between the N layer 21 and the gate electrode 51. It should be noted that theN layer 21 and the gate electrode 51 is not connected by the conductor 71 in the MOS integrated circuit used for a dynamic inverter in accordance with the present invention.In the MOS integrated circuit used for a dynamic inverter in accordance with the present invention, the impurity concentration of the silicon substrate 1 is selected low, and the local impurity concentration of a region of the silicon substrate, where relatively high threshold voltage is needed, is changed by a process such as ion implantation or low concentration diffusion. In the structure of Fio. 1, the impurity concentration of the channel region 32 under the silicon dioxide layer 42 which forms a portion of the FET Q2 is increased. In accordance with the structure of the MOS integrated circuit used for a dynamic inverter, an enhancement typeFET Q1 having a low threshold voltage Vth Q1 and an enhancement type FET Q2 having a high threshold voltageVth Q2 are obtained. Vth Q1 is approximately 0 to 0.5 volts and Vth Q2 is approximately 0.5 to 2.0 volts. The selected low impurity concentration NB of the silicon substrate 1 is approximately 1 x 1015 cm 3 to 7 x 1015 cm 3. Although both the ion implantation process and the diffusion process are available to change the local impurity concentration of the silicon substrate, the ion implantation process is more appropriate than the diffusion process because precise control in the diffusion process is difficult. A circuit of a dynamic inverter in accordance with the present invention is the same as the circuit ofFig. 2, except for the connection between the drain terminal and the gate terminal of the FET Q1. It should be noted that in the dynamic inverter the gate terminal of the FET Q1 is not connected to the drain terminal of theFET Q1 but is supplied with an input signal I.S. which has reverse phase to the input signal I.S. supplied to the gate of the FET Q2. A lbad side FET Q1 and a driver sideFET 22 are connected in series between VDD and Vss. The output signal O.S. is obtained at the connecting point of the FETs Q1 and Q2. Because of the structure of the MOS integrated circuit in accordance with the present invention, the dynamic inverter consisting of said MOS integrated circuit provides high operation speed, high output voltage level and accordingly a sufficient Noise margin, keeping dynamic operation. The MOS integrated circuit device in accordance with the present invention described above is also used for a dynamic circuit illustrated in Fig. 3. Series connected FETs Q21 , Q22 Q23 t Q24 Q11 t Q25 and Q12Q26 are in parallel and connected between VDD and V55. The connecting point of FETs Q21 and Q22 is connected to the gate of FET Q24 The connecting point of FETs Q23 andQ24 is connected to the gate of FET Q26. The connecting point of the FETs Q11 and Q25 is connected to the gate of the FET Q12 and an electrode of the condenser C formed by the MOS capacitance. The gates of the FETs Q21 , Qll receive the input signal I.S. and the gates of the FETsQ22 Q23 and Q25 receive the inverted input signal 1.5. The output signal O.S. is obtained at the connecting point of the FETs Q12 and Q26. The FETs Q11 and Q12 and the condenser C correspond to the load side FET Q1 ofFig. 2, while the FETs Q25 and Q26 correspond to the driver side FET Q2 of Fig. 2. When the level of the input signal I.S. is caused to be high and the level of the inverted input signalI.S. is caused to be low, the FETs Q21 and Qll become anON state, the FETs Q22 Q23 and Q25 become an OFF state, and then the FETs Q24 and Q12 become an ON state, the FETQ26 becomes an OFF state. Accordingly the level of the output signal O.S. becomes high. The voltage of the condenser C, which is charged by the current through VDDQ11 t P, C, Q26 and Vss t pushes up the voltage V P of the point P and accordingly the voltage of the gate of theFET Q12 t so that the voltage drop between the source and the drain of the FET Q12 is reduced and accordingly the level of the output signal O.S. is raised to VDD. The structure of a portion, consisting of theFETs Q12 and Q26 and the condenser C, of the MOS dynamic circuit of Fig. 3 is illustrated in Fig. 4. In Fig. 4, aP type silicon substrate 11, N layers 121, 122, 123, 124 formed in the upper portion of the silicon substrate 11, silicon dioxide layers 141, 142 and 143 formed on the surface of the silicon substrate 11 corresponding to the channel regions 131, 132 and 133, respectively, gate electrodes of polycrystalline silicon 151, 152 and 153 formed on the silicon dioxide layers 141, 142 and 143, respectively, isolation coatings 16, a conductor 171 connected to the N layer 121, a conductor 172 connected to the N layers 122 and 123 and a conductor 173 connected to the N layer 124 are illustrated. The N layer 121, the channel region 131 and theN layer 122 constitute the FET Q12 The N layer 122, the channel region 132 and N layer 123 constitute the condenser C. The N layer 123, the channel region 133 and N layer 124 constitute the FET Q26. In accordance with the present invention, the impurity concentration of the channel region 133 under the silicon dioxide layer 143 which forms a portion the FET Q26 is increased. Due to the structure of Fig. 4, the voltage V P at the point P in the circuit of Fig. 3 rises quickly upon application of an input signal I.S. and subsequently is pushed up to a high level by the effect of the condenser C.Accordingly, the MOS dynamic circuit of Figs. 3 and 4 provides high operation speed, high output voltage level and accordingly a sufficient Noise margin.
