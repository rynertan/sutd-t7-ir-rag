## Description
This invention relates to a device for facilitating the formation of the so called bone callus, or calcification, following a bone fracture and reduction thereof, either with or without surgical intervention. As is known, to repair bone fractures, it is of fundamental importance that large amounts of calcium be delivered to the fractured region for the setting of its fragments and regeneration of the fractured bone, a basic component whereof happens to be calcium phosphate. In pafticular, it has been shown that the metabolism of calcium and the bone process of mineralization are directly controlled both by vitamin D and the flow of an electric current of suitable intensity through the bone, which current promotes the absorption of calcium by ion exchange, regulates the calcium phosphor balance required for the mineralization of the bone, and in particular greatly accelerates the formation of the bone callus, and accordingly the recovery process. In the orthopedic field, already known are devices intended for surgical introduction into the body in order to cause a direct current to flow through a fractured bone. Such conventional devices generally include a battery, to the terminals whereof the fractured bone is connected with the optional interposition of a current stabilizing network. The battery to bone connection is such that a preset current can be passed through the bone as soon as the device is introduced into the body. This continuous flow of current, as initiated with the introduction of the device, has, however, adverse effects upon the healing of the wound generally resulting from the fracture reduction. surgery, so that while accelerating the bone callus formation time, the cited conventional devices are often annoying for the patient, who frequently refuses them. Thus, it is a primary object of the invention to provide a device of the type mentioned in the preamble, which exhibits no such drawbacks as the cited one affecting similar conventional devices, and which in particular can be activated at the desired time without adversely affecting the healing of the wound open by the fracture reduction surgical intervention or by the introduction of the device itself. Another object of the invention is to provide a device which is effective to facilitate the formation of the bone callus, and is circuit wise extremely simple, functional, and quite safe for the patient. It is a further object of this invention to provide a device as indicated, which has minimized overall dimensions, thereby it can be easily introduced into the body, and which has a very small cost. These and other objects, such as will be apparent hereinafter, are achieved by a device for facilitating the formation of bone callus in bone fractures, of the type suitable for surgical introduction into the body, comprising at least one DC voltage generator having first and second terminals, at least two leads connected with one end to said terminals and adapted for connection, with the other end, to a fractured bone, characterized in that it includes, in at least one of said leads, normally open switch means opening the circuit between said generator and said bone and being adapted for controlled change over to the closed condition through the interaction of an activating means located externally to the body, thereby said circuit between said generator and bone is closed, thus causing a current of preset intensity to flow through said bone. Further features and advantages of the device according to the invention will be more clearly apparent from the following detailed description of an embodiment thereof, as illustrated by way of example and not of limitation in the accompanying drawing., where Figure 1 shows a currently preferred embodiment of the device for facilitating the formation of bone callus according to the invention and Figure 2 shows one possible circuit diagram of a current regulator intended for association with the device of Figure 1 in order to stabilize the current supply therefrom. With specific reference to the drawing figures, and particularly to Figure 1, there is shown a general electric diagram of the inventive device, said device being generally indicated at 1. As may be seen, the device 1 includes a DC generator 2, e.g. in the form of a conventional miniaturized or button type battery capable of supplying a few volts and having a plus terminal and a minus terminal, and of an SCR serially arranged in the lead 3 connected to the plus terminal, another lead 4 being connected to the minus terminal of the generator 2. Kore specifically, the anode of the SCR, as indicated at A, is connected to said plus terminal of the generator, the cathode K of theSCR being connected to a plus terminal5, while. the electrode of gate G of said SCR is connected through a protected magnetic laminations relay or reed relag R, to the plus terminal of the generator 2. A further minus terminal 6 is also provided for either direct connection to the bone, or in most cases, to a voltage regulating circuit hich willbemore specifically described hereinafter. The reed relay R is intended for subcutaneous implantation in close proximity of the skin, such that its reeds and L2 can be closed, for example by passing a magnet M over the body in the vicinity of said reed relay R. In the situation shown inFigure 1 with the reeds L1, B 2 of the reed relay R being open, no current can flow between the terminals 5 and 6, even with the load bone connected.In fact, the SCR is selected to be, with the reeds L1 and B2 in the open condition, in a direct blocking state, the changing over of the SCR to the forward conducting state being only allowed upon the occurrence of a gating pulse to be obtained, as those skilledintheartwill readily recognize, by closing the reeds i L 2 under the effect of the magnet M, the gate of the SCE being in this case connected to the plus side of the generator 2. Obviously, once energized, the SCR will remain conductive practically until the battery has been exhausted. In Figure 2, for completion sake, there is shown a general circuit diagram of a voltage regulator adapted for cascade connection between the terminals 5 and 6 to regulate or stabilize the voltage supplied by the generator 2. This voltage regulator, which comprises an NPR transistor Tr, will be no further described because well known to the expert. It will be sufficient to remark that thanks to the base connected trimmer, it becomes possible to regulate the current supplied within a fairly wide range, the regulation being of the parallel type and an optimum value being, as ascertained through actual tests, 0.4 Volts with the current in the 9 to 20. microAmp range. Of course, the electronic device of this inventiolllwill be enclosed in a suitable sterile material container which will be compatible with the surgical requirements and in particular with the introduction into the body. The overall size of the circuit has been minimized, such that the device can cause no inconvenience to the patient. It will be appreciated from the foregoing that the invention fully achieves its objects in particular a device for facilitating the formation of bone callus has been provided which, contrary to similar conventional devices, does not feed the bone in a continuous manner, but only feeds it upon control from the outside, after the wound has healed.The device, moreover, is reliable in operation because it is free of such critical factors as, for example, bias effects, transistor gain, oxidation of relay contacts, etc., which are all apt to jeopardize the attainment of good final results. The invention as conceived is susceptible to many modifications and variations, without departing from the purview of the instant inventive concept.As an example, susceptible to modification is the particular circuit layout selected for activating the device at the desired time, the invention essence residing in the utilization of normally open switching means adapted to be closed at a desired time to stimulate the bone. In particular, instead of the reed relay, the switching element may comprise, for Instance, a resonant circuit operative to energize the control electrode of the SOR through the interaction with a magnetic field of preset frequency, which is produced externally to the body. In addition.to the reed relay, a suitable gating current limiting resistor may be connected in series during the turning on of the SCR. Furthermore, while the invention has been described with specific reference to its application to the formation of bone callus, it should be noted that the instant device may also be used in all those applications where an apparatus introduced into the body is to be activated from the outside at a preset time, one typical case being that of a pace maker. Therefore, both the foregoing description and the accompanying illustrative drawing should be regarded as exemplary only, the invention spirit and scope being more clearly defined in the appended claims.
