# IMPROVEMENTS IN AND TO FEEDER APPARATUSES FOR FEEDING A RESISTENT FILAMENTOUS ELEMENT HOUSED IN THE INTERIOR OF FLEXIBLE PIPES

## Abstract
A feeding apparatus for feeding a resistant filamentous element extending in the interior of flexible pipes manufac tured by means of extrusion machines of conventional type. The improvements consist in that the apparatus is coupled to the extrusion head of the machine and is provided with a tubular piece which cooperates in feeding the filamentous element which passes through the interior of the extrusion head into the interior of a conduit which traverses in a longitudinal direction the extrusion chamber coaxially there with, the said filamentous element coming out through the interior of the flexible pipe which is being formed and successively wound in order to facilitate storage.
