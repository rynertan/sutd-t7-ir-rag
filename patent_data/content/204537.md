## Description
The present invention relates generally to liquid crystals and, more particularly, to encapsulated liquid crystals having a smectic phase. Moreover, the invention relates to devices using such encapsulated liquid crystals. Liquid crystals currently are used in a wide variety of devices, including optical devices such as visual displays. Such devices usually require relatively low power and have a satisfactory response time, provide reasonable contrast, and are relatively economical. The property of liquid crystals enabling use, for example, in visual displays, is the ability of liquid crystals to transmit light on one hand, and to scatter and or absorb light, on the other, depending on the alignment or lack of alignment of the liquid crystal structure with, e.g., an electric field applied across the liquid crystal material. An example of electrically responsive liquid crystal material and use thereof is provided in U.S. Patent 3, 322, 485. Certain liquid crystal material is responsive to temperature, changing optical characteristics in response to temperature of the liquid crystal material. The present invention is disclosed hereinafter particularly with reference to the use of liquid crystal material that is particularly responsive to an electric field as well as to temperature. Currently there are three categories of liquid crystal materials, namely cholesteric, nematic and smectic types. The invention of the present application relates in the preferred embodiment described below to use of liquid crystal material having a smectic phase. The invention may also be employed with a liquid crystal material having a smectic as well as a nematic phase. The various characteristics of the cholesteric, nematic and smectic types of liquid crystal material are described in the prior art. One know characteristic of liquid crystal material is that of reversibility in particular it is noted here that nematic liquid crystal material is known to be reversible, but cholesteric material is not reversible. One characteristic of a reversible nematic material is that the liquid crystal structure will return to its original configuration after an electric field, for example, has been applied and then removed. On the other hand, smectic material will retain its configuration even after removal of an electric field. To enhance contrast and possibly other properties of liquid crystal material, pleochroic dyes have been mixed with the liquid crystal material to form a solution therewith. The molecules of the pleochroic dye generally align with the molecules of the liquid crystal material. Therefore, such pleochroic dyes will tend to function optically in a manner similar to that of the liquid crystal material in response to a changing parameter, such as application or non application of an electric field or heat. Examples of the use of pleochroic dyes with liquid crystal material are described in U.S. Patents 3,499,702 and 3,551,026. An important characteristic of liquid crystal material is anisotropy. An anisotropic material has different physical properties in different directions. For example, liquid crystals are optically anisotropic, i.e., they have indices of refraction which vary with the direction of propagation and polarization of the incident light. Liquid crystal material also has electrical anisotropy. For example, the dielectric constant for smectic liquid crystal material may be one value when the molecules in the liquid crystal structure are parallel to the electric field and may have a different value when the molecules in the liquid crystal structure are aligned perpendicular to an electric field. Since such dielectric value is a function of alignment, for example, reference to the same as a dielectric coefficient may be more apt than the usual dielectric constant label. Similar properties are true for other types of liquid crystals. Some brief discussion of the encapsulation of cholesteric liquid crystal material is presented in U.S. Patents 3,720,623, 3,341,466, and 2,800,457, the latter two patents being referred to in the first named patent. In the past, devices using liquid crystals, such as visual display devices or other devices, have been of relatively small size. Large size devices using liquid crystals, such as, for example, a billboard display or a sign have not been satisfactorily fabricatable for a number of reasons. One reason is the fluidity of the liquid crystals, the liquid crystal material may tend to flow creating areas of the display that have different thicknesses . As a result, the optical characteristics of the display may lack uniformity, have varying contrast characteristics at different portions of the display, etc. The thickness variations in turn cause variations or gradations in optical properties of the liquid crystal device. Moreover, the varying thickness of the liquid crystal layer will cause corresponding variations in the electrical properties of the liquid crystal layer, such as capacitance and impendance, further reducing uniformity of a large size liquid crystal device. The varying electrical properties of the liquid crystal layer, then, also may cause a corresponding variation in the effective electric field applied across the liquid crystal material and or in response to a constant electric field would respond differently at areas of the liquid crystal that are of different thicknesses. A pleochroic display, i.e., one in which pleochroic dye and liquid crystal material are in solution together, has the advantage of not requiring the use of a polarizer. However, such a pleochroic device has a disadvantage of relatively low contrast when only nematic liquid crystal material is used. It was discovered in the past, though, that a cholesteric liquid crystal material could be added to the nematic one together with the dye to improve the contrast ratio. See White et al. article, Another problem encountered with pleochroic dye included in solution with liquid crystal material, regardless of the particular type of liquid crystal material, is that the light absorption of the dye is not zero in the field on condition. Rather such absorption in the field on condition follows a so called ordering parameter, which relates to or is a function of the relative alignment of the dyes. The optical transmission characteristic of liquid crystal material is an exponential function of the thickness of the liquid crystal material. Specifically, the on state or field on or energized state of the liquid crystal material is an exponential function of the thickness of the liquid crystal material, and the absorbing state or field off state also is a different exponential function of the thickness. To overcome those problems described in the two immediately preceding paragraphs, the liquid crystal material should have an optimum uniform thickness. As used herein the term liquid crystal material means the liquid crystals themselves and, depending on context, the pleochroic dye in solution therewith . There also should be an optimum spacing of the electrodes by which the electric field or heat is applied to the liquid crystal material. To maintain such optimum thickness and spacing, rather close tolerances must be maintained. To maintain close tolerances, there is a limit as to the size of the device using such liquid crystals, for it is quite difficult to maintain close tolerances over large surface areas, for example. It is known that a layer of liquid crystal material having a smectic phase can be switched between a light scattering state and a non scattering homeotropic state by heating until the smectic phase disappears and is replaced by an isotropic, nematic or cholesteric phase, and allowing the liquid crystal material to cool, whilst applying an electric field Optical Engineering Vol. 23, No. 3, pages 253 260 . The scattering properties of the liquid crystal in a smectic phase being dependent on whether an electric field is present or not as it cools. U.S. 4104207 and WO 83 01016 both disclose an electronic display device having encapsulated smectic liquid crystal material. However, neither document discloses a method or apparatus capable of driving such a device. JP A 5827124 discloses a liquid crystal display device which uses encapsulated smectic liquid crystals which assume a light scattering state or a light transparent state dependent upon a predetermined heat input. Switching between states is therefore only possible by heating the liquid crystal. A liquid crystal device is known which comprises a liquid crystal material having a smectic and non smectic phase, the liquid crystal material operable between the smectic and non smectic phases by means of heating, and means for applying an electric field across the liquid crystal material IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin Vo. 27, No. 7A, pages 4050 4053 . The device being driven by a combination of electrical and thermal pulses. The device of this disclosure is however limited as hereinbefore discussed since it does not utilise encapsulated liquid crystal material. The present invention provides a liquid crystal device comprising liquid crystal material having a smectic and a non smectic phase means for applying an electric field across the liquid crystal material and means for applying heat to the liquid crystal material the liquid crystal material of the device being selectively switchable between a clear, light transmissive state and a scattering or light absorbing state, both states being exhibited by the liquid crystal material when it is in its smectic phase, the clear state being reached in response to the application of the electric field, whereas the scattering or light absorbing state is reached as a result of applying to the liquid crystal material heat enough for putting it in its non smectic phase during a time in which no electric field is applied characterised in that the liquid crystal material is confined within discrete volumes by an encapsulating medium, said encapsulating medium inducing a generally distorted alignment of the liquid crystal molecules when the liquid crystal material is in the non smectic phase and when no electrical field is applied, which distorted alignment results in the scattering or light absorption state. The transition temperature of the liquid crystal material determines whether it is in the smectic or nematic phase. In the nematic phase, the liquid crystal is operationally nematic, as defined below and in U.S. Patent 4,435,047 W0 83 010 16 . By operational nematic is meant that, in the absence of external fields, structural distortion of the liquid crystal is dominated by the orientation of the liquid crystal at its boundaries rather than by bulk effects, such as very strong twists as in cholesteric material or layering as in smectic material . Thus, for example, chiral ingredients which induce a tendency to twist but cannot overcome the effects of boundary alignment would still be considered operationally nematic. Such operationally nematic liquid crystal material may include pleochroic dyes, chiral compounds, or other co ingredients. A capsule as used herein generally refers to a containment device or medium that confines a quantity of liquid crystal material, and encapsulating medium or material is that medium or material of which such capsules are formed. An encapsulated liquid crystal or encapsulated liquid crystal material means a quantity of liquid crystal material confined or contained in discrete volumes within the encapsulating medium, for example in a solid medium as individual capsules or dried stable emulsions. The discrete volumes, however, may also be interconnected, for example, by one or more passages. The liquid crystal would preferably be in both the discrete volumes and interconnecting passages. Thus, the internal volumes of respective capsules may be fluidly coupled via one or more interconnecting passages. The capsules can generally have an approximately spherical configuration though this is not, A liquid crystal device is a deviced formed of liquid crystal material. In the present invention such devices are formed of encapsulated liquid crystals having a smectic phase capable of providing a function of the type typically inuring to liquid crystal material for example, such a liquid crystal device may be a visual display or an optical shutter that in response to application and removal of an electric field and heat effects a selected attenuation of optical radiation, preferably including from far infrared through ultraviolet wavelengths. One method of making encapsulated liquid crystals includes mixing together liquid crystal material having a smectic phase and an encapsulating medium in which the liquid crystal material will not dissolve and permitting the formation of discrete capsules containing the liquid crystal material. A method of making a liquid crystal device including such encapsulated liquid crystal includes, for example applying such encapsulated liquid crystal material to a substrate. Moreover, such method includes providing means for applying an electric field and heat to the liquid crystal material to affect a property thereof. A liquid crystal material having a smectic phase in which is dissolved a pleochroic dye can be placed in a generally spherical capsule. In the absence of an electric field, the capsule wall distorts the liquid crystal structure so it and the dye will tend to absorb light regardless of its polarization direction. When a suitable electric field is applied across such a capsule, for example across an axis thereof, the liquid crystal material will tend to align parallel to such field causing the absorption characteristic of such material to be reduced to one assumed when the liquid crystal material is in the planar configuration. To help assure that adequate electric field is applied across the liquid crystal material in the capsule, and not just across or through the encapsulating medium, and, in fact, with a minimum voltage drop across the wall thickness of the respective capsules, the encapsulating material preferably has a dielectric constant no less than the lower dielectric constant of the liquid crystal material, on the one hand, and a relatively large impedance, on the other hand. Ideally, the dielectric constant of the encapsulating medium should be close to the higher dielectric constant of the liquid crystal. Contrast of a liquid crystal device employing encapsulated liquid crystals may be improved by selecting an encapsulating medium that has an index of refraction that is matched to the ordinary index of refraction of the liquid crystal material i.e., the index of refraction parallel to the optical axis of the crystal . See, e.g. Optics by Born Wolf, or Crystals and the Polarizing Microscope by Hartshorne Stewart. The encapsulating medium may be used not only to encapsulated liquid crystal material but also to adhere the capsules to a substrate for support thereon. Alternatively, a further binding medium may be used to hold the liquid crystal capsules relative to a substrate. In the latter case, though preferably the additional binding medium has an index of refraction which is matched to that of the encapsulating medium for maintaining the improved contrast characteristic described above. Because the index of refraction of a material is generally strain dependent, and strain may be induced in, e.g., the encapsulating medium, it may be necessary to consider this effect in matching the indices of refraction of the liquid crystal, encapsulating medium, and binding medium, if present. Further, if iridescence is to be avoided, it may be desirable to match the indices of refraction over a range of wavelengths to the extent possible, rather than at just one wavelength. The molecules of the liquid crystal material in the smectic phase prior to the application of an electric field thereto tend to align themselves generally perpendicular to the curved surfaces of the spherical or otherwise curvilinear surfaced capsule. Accordingly, the liquid crystal structure tends to be forced or distorted to a specific form, generally focal conic, so that the resulting optical characteristic of a given capsule containing liquid crystal material is such that substantially all light delivered thereto will be affected, for example, scattered when no pleochroic dye is present or absorbed when pleochroic dye is present , prior to the application of an electric field, regardless of the polarization direction of the incident light. Even without dye this effect can cause scattering and thus opacity. The molecules of the smectic phase liquid crystal material can align themselves in a direction parallel to an electric field applied thereto and can remain in that alignment after removal of the electric field. When aligned in this manner, the liquid crystal material reduces the amount of scattering or absorption of light that would otherwise be present. The subsequent application of sufficient heat to the liquid crystal material induces the generally distorted alignment of the liquid crystal material such that light is scattered or absorbed. The temperature at which this occurs may be the smectic to nematic phase transition temperature or the smectic to isotropic phase transition temperature. This concept may be called heat to erase. These properties can be utilised in a thermally activated display. This display utilises an encapsulated liquid crystal material having both a smectic and nematic phase. The liquid crystal is heated so that it is in the nematic phase, and an electric field is applied thereto to effect a visual display. The temperature of the liquid crystal is reduced so that it is in the smectic phase. The electric field is removed and the display remains. The display may be erased by heating the liquid crystal so that it is again in the nematic phase. The effective thickness of the liquid crystal material contained in a capsule can be controlled by controlling the internal diameter of such capsule. Such diameter control may be affected by a size fractionation separation process during the making of the encapsulated liquid crystals using any one of a variety of conventional or novel sorting techniques as well as by controlling the mixing process, the quantities of ingredients, and or the nature of the ingredients provided during mixing. By controlling such thickness parameter to relatively close tolerances, then, the subsequent tolerance requirements when the final liquid crystal device is made using the encapsulated liquid crystals will not be as critical as was required in the past for non encapsulated devices. Moreover, there appears to be no limitation on the size of a high quality liquid crystal device that can be made using the encapsulated liquid crystals. More specifically, by providing for confinement of discrete quantities of liquid crystal material, for example, in the described capsules, the various problems encountered in the past that prevented the use of liquid crystal material in large size devices are overcome, for each individual capsule in effect can still operate as an independent liquid crystal device. Moreover, each capsule preferably has physical properties enabling it to be mounted in virtually any environment including one containing a plurality of further such liquid crystal capsules mounted to a substrate or otherwise supported for use in response to application and removal of some type of excitation source, such as, for example, an electric field or heat. This feature also enables placement of the liquid crystal material on only selected areas of the optical device, such as in large size displays e.g., billboards , optical shutters, etc. Important considerations are that an encapsulating medium having electrical properties matched in a prescribed way to the electrical properties of liquid crystal material encapsulated thereby and additionally preferably optically matched to the optical properties of such liquid crystal material permits efficient and high quality functioning of the liquid crystal material in response to excitation or non excitation by an external source and that the interaction of the encapsulating medium with the liquid crystal material distorts the latter in a prescribed manner changing an operational mode of liquid crystal material. An object of the invention is to enable the use of liquid crystal material having a smectic phase wherein that material is encapsulated and maintains relatively high quality of operation, controlled uniformity of output and satisfactory contrast. Another object is to confine liquid crystal material having a smectic phase wherein a generally distorted alignment is induced that scatters or absorbs light and reduced in response to a prescribed input with such reduction remaining after removal of the prescribed input, thereby providing a display having memory. Yet another object is to enable a display to be erased or heated by the application of heat to increase the temperature of the liquid crystal so that it is not in the smectic phase. Examples of the invention will now be described with reference to the drawings, in which Referring now in detail to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals designate like parts in the several figures, and initially to Fig. 1, a prior art liquid crystal device is generally indicated at 1. Such device 1 includes liquid crystal material 2 sandwiched between electrodes 3 of, for example, indium tin oxide that are deposited for support on respective mounting or confining substrates 4, such as glass, plastic sheets or the like. The sheets 4 may be clear as may be the electrodes 3 so that the device 1 is an optical transmission control device, whereby incident light may be absorbed and or scattered when no electric field is applied by the electrodes 3 across a liquid crystal material 2 and the incident light may be transmitted through the liquid crystal material 2 when an electric field is applied thereacross. Electric leads 5 and switch 6 selectively couple voltage source 7 across the electrodes 3 to provide such electric field. The voltage source 7 may be either an AC or a DC voltage source. The liquid crystal material 2 in the device 1 is somewhat confined by the substrates 4 for retention in a desired location, say for example, to be used overall as part of a digital display device. On the other hand, the liquid crystal material 2 must have adequate freedom of movement so that it may assume either a random orientation or distribution when no electric field is applied or a prescribed distributional or orientational alignment when an electric field is applied across the electrodes 3. If desired, one of the substrates 4 may be reflective to reflect incident light received through the liquid crystal material 2 back through the latter for delivery through the other substrate 4 for subsequent use. The various principles of operation and features and disadvantages of the liquid crystal device 1 are summarised above and are described in the prior art literature. The liquid crystal material 2 may be of virtually any type that is responsive to an electric field applied thereacross so as to have a desired operating characteristic intended for the device 1. The liquid crystal material 2 also may include, if desired, pleochroic dye material in solution therewith. Turning now to Fig. 2, an improved liquid crystal device in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is indicated at 10. The device 10 includes an encapsulated liquid crystal 11 having a smectic phase which is supported by a mounting substrate 12 across which an electric field may be applied via electrodes 13, 14. The electrode of 13 may be, for example, a quantity of vacuum deposited indium tin oxide applied to the substrate 12, and the electrode 14 may be, for example, electrically conductive ink. A protective layer or coating 15 may be applied over the electrode 14 for protective purposes but such layer 15 ordinarily would not be necessary for supporting or confining the encapsulated liquid crystal 11 or the electrode 14. Voltage may be applied to the electrodes 13, 14 from an AC or DC voltage source 16. A selectively closable switch 17 and electrical leads 18, 19 are utilized to apply an electric field across the encapsulated liquid crystal 11 when the switch 17 is closed. A second selectively closable switch 60 and electrical leads 62, 64 may be utilized to provide a resistive heating source for the application of heat to the liquid crystal material to increase the temperature thereof for the purposes hereinafter described. Switch 60 may be closed to cause a suitable current to flow through electrode 13 so as to heat the liquid crystal material to the desired level. Other techniques, such as a heat gun, may be utilized to heat the liquid crystal material. The encapsulated liquid crystal 11 includes liquid crystal material 20 contained within the confines or interior volume 21 of a capsule 22. Preferrably, the capsule 22 is generally spherical. However, the principles of the invention would apply when the capsule 22 is of a shape other than spherical. Such shape should provide the desired optical and electrical characteristics that will satisfactorily coexist with the optical characteristics of the liquid crystal 20, e.g., index of refraction, and will permit an adequate portion of the electric field to occur across the liquid crystal material 20 itself for effecting desired alignment of the liquid crystal structure when it is desired to have a field on condition. A particular advantage to the preferred spherical configuration of the capsule 22 will be described below with respect to the distortion it effects on the liquid crystal structure. The mounting substrate 12 and the electrodes 13, 14 as well as the protective coating 15 may be optically transmissive so that the liquid crystal device 10 is capable of controlling transmission of light therethrough in response to whether or not an electric field is applied across the electrodes 13, 14 and, thus, across the encapsulated liquid crystal 11. Alternatively, the mounting substrate 12 may be optically reflective or may have thereon an optically reflective coating so that reflection by such reflective coating of incident light received through the protective coating 15 will be a function of whether or not there is an electric field applied across the encapsulated liquid crystal 11. Preferably, a plurality of encapsulated liquid crystals 11 would be applied to the mounting substrate 12 in a manner such that the encapsulated liquid crystals adhere to the mounting substrate 12 or to an interface material, such as the electrode 13, for support by the mounting substrate 12 and retention in a fixed position relative to the other encapsulated liquid crystals 11. Most preferably the encapsulating medium of which the capsule 22 is formed is also suitable for binding or otherwise adhering the capsule 22 to the substrate 12. Alternatively, a further binding medium not shown may be used to adhere the encapsulated liquid crystals 11 to the substrate 12. Since the capsules 22 are adhered to the substrate 12, and since each capsule 22 provides the needed confinement for the liquid crystal material 20, a second mounting substrate, such as the additional one shown in the prior art liquid crystal device 1 of Fig. 1, ordinarily would be unnecessary. However, for the purpose of providing protection from scarring, electrochemical deterioration, e.g., oxidation, or the like, of the electrode 14, a protective coating 15 may be provided on the side or surface of the liquid crystal device 10 opposite the mounting substrate 12, the latter providiny the desired physical protection on its own side of the device 10. Since the encapsulated liquid crystals 11 are relatively securely adhered to the substrate 12 and since there ordinarily would be no need for an additional substrate, as mentioned above, the electrode 14 may be applied directly to the encapsulated liquid crystals 21. Turning now to Fig. 3, an example of a liquid crystal device 10 is shown in the form of a liquid crystal display device, which appears as a square cornered figure eight 30 on the substrate 12, which in this case preferably is of a plastic material, such as Mylar, or may alternatively be another material, such as glass, for example. The shaded area appearing in Fig. 3 to form the square cornered figure eight is formed of plural encapsulated liquid crystals 11 aranged in one or more layers on and adhered to the substrate 12. An enlarged fragmentary section view of a portion 32 of the figure eight 30 and substrate 12 is illustrated in Fig. 4. As is seen in Fig. 4, on the surface 31 of the substrate 12, which may be approximately 10 ²m 10 mils thick, is deposited a 2 x 10 ⁸m 200 angstrom thick electrode layer 33 of, for example, indium tin oxide or other suitable electrode material such as gold, aluminum, tin oxide, antimony in oxide, etc. One or more layers 34 of plural encapsulated liquid crystals 11 are applied and adhered directly to the electrode layer 33. Such adherence is preferably effected by the encapsulating medium that forms respective capsules 22, although, if desired, as was mentioned above, an additional adhering or binding material may be used for such adherence purposes. The thickness of the layer 34 may be, for example, approximately 3 x 10 ⁴m to 10 ²m 0.3 to 10 mils preferably 7 x 10 ⁴m to 4 x 10 ³m 0.7 to 4 mils , more preferably 8 x 10 ⁴m to 1.2 x 10 ³m 0.8 to 1.2 mils , especially 10 ³m 1 mil . Other thicknesses may also be used, depending In a conventional visual display device either of the liquid crystal or light emitting diode type, the figure eight element 30 ordinarily would be divided into seven electrically isolated segments, each of which may be selectively energised or not so as to create various numeral characters. For example, energisation of the segments 30a and 30b would display the numeral 1 , and energisation of the segments 30a, 30b, and 30c would display the numeral 7 . A feature of one embodiment of the present invention utilising the encapsulated liquid crystals 11 is that a versatile substrate 12 can be created to be capable of displaying virtually any desired display as a function of only the selective segments of conductive ink electrodes printed on the liquid crystal material. In this case, the entire surface 31 of the substrate 12 may be coated with electrode material 33, and even the entire surface of that electrode material may be coated substantially contiguously with layer 34 of encapsulated liquid crystals 11. Thereafter, a prescribed pattern of electrode segments of conductive ink 35 may be printed where desired on the layer 34. A single electrical lead may attach the surface 31 to a voltage source, and respective electrical leads may couple the respective conductive ink segments via respective controlled switches to such voltage source. Alternatively, the encapsulated liquid crystals 11 and or the electrode material 33 may be applied to the surface 31 only at those areas where display segments are desired. The ability to apply encapsulated liquid crystal to only a desired area or plurality of areas such as the segments of a display by essentially conventional processes such as e.g. silk screening or other printing processes is particularly attractive, when compared with the prior art, which has the problem of containing liquid crystals between flat plates. Although a detailed description of the operation of the individual encapsulated liquid crystals 11 will be presented below, it will suffice here to note that the encapsulated liquid crystals in the layer 34 function to attenuate or not to attenuate light incident thereon. A pleochroic dye may be present in solution in the liquid crystal material to provide substantial attenuation by absorption prior to the application of the field but to be substantially transparent after the field has been applied. Such an electric field may be, for example, one produced as a result of the coupling of the electrode layer portions 33, 35 at an individual segment, such as segment 30a, of the liquid crystal device 10 to an electrical voltage source. The magnitude of the electric field required to switch the encapsulated liquid crystals 11 from a no field deenergized condition to a field on energized condition may be a function of several parameters, including, for example, the diameter of the individual capsules and the thickness of the layer 34, which in turn may depend on the diameter of individual capsules 22 and the number of such capsules in the thickness direction of layer 34. Importantly, it will be appreciated that since the liquid crystal material 20 is confined in respective capsules 22 and since the individual encapsulated liquid crystals 11 are secured to the substrate 12, the size of the liquid crystal device 10 or any other liquid crystal device employing encapsulated liquid crystals in accordance with the present invention is virtually unlimited. Of course, at those areas where it is intended to effect a change in the optical properties of the encapsulated liquid crystals of such a device in response to a no field or field on condition, it would be necessary to have at such areas electrodes or other means for applying to such liquid crystals a suitable electric field. The electrode layer 33 may be applied to the substrate 12 by evaporation, by vacuum deposition, by sputtering, by printing or by another conventional technique. Moreover, the layer 34 of encapsulated liquid crystals 11 may be applied, for example, by a web or gravure roller or by reverse roller printing techniques. The electrode layer 35 also may be applied by various printing, stenciling or other techniques. If desired, the electrode layer 33 may be prepared as a full coating of the substrate 12, such as Mylar, as described above, as part of the process in which the Mylar sheet material is manufactured, and the layer 34 also may be applied as part of such manufacturing process. Electrode 33 may be attached to a voltage source through a selectively closable switch 60 separate from the respective controlled switches utilized to energize the conductive segments. When switch 60 is pulsed closed, electrode 33 functions as a resistive heating element that applies heat to the liquid crystal material to increase the temperature thereof. If the liquid crystal material has both a smectic and nematic phase, heat may be applied, by closing switch 60, to heat the liquid crystal through its transition temperature where it changes from the smectic to the nematic phase. Thereafter, an electric field across electrodes 33, 35 can be applied to the liquid crystal material, now in the nematic phase, such that the liquid crystal material is substantially transparent to effect a visual display, such as the numeral 1 . See Fig. 6 . The temperature of the liquid crystal may then be reduced, by opening switch 60, so that the liquid crystal is in the smectic phase. The electric field may then be removed. The display, however, will be retained See Fig. 8a , e.g., the numeral 1 , since the molecules of the liquid crystal in the smectic phase are not free to change direction and the liquid crystal is more viscous in this phase. The above described concept may be called a thermally activated display. To erase the display, switch 60 may again be pulsed closed to heat the liquid crystal above its transition temperature where it is in the nematic phase. As discussed, in the nematic phase, incident light is absorbed or scattered in the absence of an electric field See Fig. 8b . Thus, the display is effectively erased. The display may also be erased by heating the liquid crystal so that it is in its isotropic phase wherein incident light is scattered or absorbed. A liquid crystal material having only a smectic phase may also be utilized. The smectic phase may either be smectic A phase or smectic C phase. The smectic C phase operates at lower voltages than smectic A, and the smectic C phase may have a chiral character. An electric field may be applied across the liquid crystal in the smectic phase to eliminate the scattering or absorption of light otherwise present See Fig. 6 . The display formed by the application of the electric field, such as the numeral 1 , remains after the field is removed See Fig. 8a . The display may be thereafter erased by heating the liquid crystal to a temperature above the smectic to isotropic phase transition temperature. Alternatively, it may be erased by heating it to a temperature above the smectic to nematic phase transition temperature. This display concept may be called the heat to erase concept. It differs from the thermally activated display in that the field is applied and display effected with the liquid crystal in the smectic phase. The smectic phase encapsulated system which operates at moderate voltages can be used to form a novel type of display. The principle is based on the above described ability of smectic liquid crystal to store indefinitely when exposed to an electric field. Thus a display can be made using a matrix of elements, such that there is a cross grid formed. A permanent pattern can be formed on the cross grid by elevating voltage on the lines and rows to be written, simultaneously. Thus, rows not written can be put at a voltage which is close to that of the columns. The same voltage, with opposite polarity, can be put on those rows to be written, so that a voltage appears across the column row intersection which is two times greater than that applied to rows which are not to be written. If this process is carried out in sequence at a rate sufficiently slow so that RMS increases in voltage do not occur across row column intersections, then a pattern can be formed which will remain in place until such time as the display is heated to erase to the phase transition of the smectic liquid crystal. The heat to erase and the thermally activated displays are especially suitable for use in display devices where there is relatively long time periods between changes in or updates of the display. The displays may also be used as a temperature indicating label to indicate when there is a temperature rise above a certain level. For example, certain chemicals must be stored below a given temperature. A label reading OK, e.g., may be applied to a container holding the chemicals. The OK display would disappear or be erased when the temperature rises above the undesirable or even dangerous level. The ability to make and to use successfully heat to erase and thermally activated liquid crystal devices of the type just described is in part due to the ability to make encapsulated liquid crystals and to the properties of such encapsulated liquid crystals. Referring specifically to Fig. 5, the capsule 22 has a generally smooth curved interior wall surface 50 defining the boundary of the volume 21. The actual dimensional parameters of the wall surface 50 and of the overall capsule 22 are related to the quantity of liquid crystal material 20 contained therein. Additionally, the capsule 22 applies a force to the liquid crystals 20 tending to pressurise or at least to maintain substantially constant the pressure within the volume 21. As a result of the foregoing, and due to the surface wetting nature of the liquid crystal, the structure which ordinarily in free form would tend to be straight, although perhaps randomly distributed, is distorted to have a generally focal conic form. Due to such distortion the liquid crystals store elastic energy. For simplicity of illustration, and for facility of comprehending the foregoing concept, the liquid crystal molecules whose directional orientation is represented by respective dashed lines 52 are shown as having a bulk alignment wherein the liquid crystal molecules radiate to be generally perpendicular to a relatively proximal portion of the interior wall surface 50. Thus, the organisation of liquid crystal molecules in an individual capsule is determined by the bulk alignment of the molecules within the capsules unless acted on by outside forces, e.g., an electric field. As noted heretofore, on removal of the field, the directional orientation illustrated in Fig. 6 of the smectic liquid crystal remains see Fig. 8a . The distorted alignment depicted in Fig. 5 returns upon the application of heat to the liquid crystal to heat it above the phase transition temperature see Fig. 8b . The liquid crystal molecules have a smectic phase. Such molecules usually assume a parallel configuration, and a liquid crystal material comprised of such molecules usually is optical polarization direction sensitive. However, since the structure 52 in the encapsulated liquid crystal 11 is distorted or forced to assume focal conic form shown in Figs. 5 or 8b in the full three dimensions of the capsule 22, such liquid crystal material in such capsule takes on an improved characteristic of being insensitive to the direction of optical polarization of light incident thereon. Moreover, when the liquid crystal material 20 in the capsule 22 has pleochroic dye dissolved therein, such dye, which ordinarily also would be expected to have optical polarization sensitivity, no longer is polarization sensitive because the dye tends to follow the same kind of orientation or distortion as that of the liquid crystal structure. With the liquid crystal structure being distorted generally in the manner illustrated in Figs. 5 and 8b, the encapsulated liquid crystal 11 ordinarily will absorb or block light from being transmitted therethrough prior to the application of an electric field across the encapsulated liquid crystal 11 and particularly across the liquid crystal material 20 thereof. Although the foregoing discussion has been in terms of a homeotropic orientation of the liquid crystal material, such is not a requisite of the invention. All that is required is that the interaction between the capsule and the liquid crystal produce an orientation in the liquid crystal that is generally uniform and piecewise continuous, so that the spatial average orientation of the liquid crystal material over the capsule volume is generally focal conic and there is no substantial parallel directional orientation of the liquid crystal in the absence of an electric field. It is this orientation that results in the absorption scattering and polarization insensitivity. However, when an electric field is applied across the encapsulated liquid crystal 11 in the manner illustrated in Fig. 6, the liquid crystal and any pleochroic dye in solution therewith will align in response to the electric field in the manner shown in such figures. Such alignment permits light to be transmitted through the encapsulated liquid crystal 11, for example as described above with reference to Figs. 2, 3 and 4. When the electric field is removed, the alignment of the liquid crystal as shown in Fig. 6 remains. The application of heat to the liquid crystal as shown in Fig. 8b causes the liquid crystal to return to the distorted alignment illustrated in Fig. 5. To optimize the contrast characteristics of a liquid crystal device, such as that shown at 10 in Fig. 3, comprised of encapsulated liquid crystals 11, and more particularly, to avoid optical distortion, due to refraction of incident light passing from the encapsulating medium into the liquid crystal material and vice versa, of the encapsulated liquid crystal 11 of Fig. 6, the index of refraction of the encapsulating medium and that the ordinary index of refraction of the liquid crystal material should be matched so as to be as much as possible the same. The closeness of the index matching will be dependent on the desired degree of contrast and transparency in the device, but the ordinary index of refraction of the crystal and the index of the medium will preferably differ by no more than 0.03, more preferably 0.01, especially 0.001. The tolerated difference will depend on capsule size and intended use of the device. The text Optics by Sears, published by Addison Wesley, contains a thorough discussion of birefringence relevant to the foregoing. However, when no field is applied there will be a difference in indices of refraction at the boundary of the liquid crystal and capsule wall due to the extraordinary index of refraction of the liquid crystal being greater than the encapsulating medium. This causes refraction at that interface or boundary and thus further scattering and is a reason why encapsulated liquid crystal material in particular, will function to prevent transmission of light even without the use of pleochroic dye. Ordinarily the encapsulated liquid crystals 11 would be applied to the substrate 12 Fig. 3 such that the individual encapsulated liquid crystals 11 are relatively randomly oriented and preferably several capsules thick to assure an adequate quantity of liquid crystal material on the surface 31 of the substrate to thereby provide the desired level of light blockage and or transmission characteristics for, for example, a liquid crystal device 10 or the like. In a liquid crystal device, such as that shown in 10 in Fig. 3, which is comprised of liquid crystal material 20 including pleochroic dye to form encapsulated liquid crystals 11 it has been discovered that the degree of optical absorbency is at least about the same as that of relatively free unencapsulated liquid crystal material, including pleochroic dye such as that shown in Fig. 1. It also has been discovered unexpectedly that when the electric field is applied in the manner illustrated in Fig. 6, for example, the clarity or lack of opaqueness of the encapsulated liquid crystal material 20 including pleochroic dye is at least about the same as that of the ordinary case in the prior art device 1 having dye in solution with relatively free liquid crystal material. It is important that electrical field E shown in Fig. 6 is applied to the liquid crystal material 20 in the capsule 22 for the most part rather than being dissipated or dropped substantially in the encapsulating material of which the capsule itself is formed. In other words, it is important that there not be a substantial voltage drop across or through the material of which the wall 54 of the capsule 22 is formed rather, the voltage drop should occur predominantly across the liquid crystal material 20 within the volume 21 of the capsule 22. The electrical impedance of the encapsulating medium preferably should in effect be sufficiently larger than that of the liquid crystal material in the encapsulated liquid crystal 11 so that a short circuit will not occur exclusively through the wall 54, say from point A via only the wall to point B, bypassing the liquid crystal material. Therefore, for example, the effective impedance to induced or displacement current flow through or via the wall 54 from point A only via the wall 54 to point B should be greater than the impedance that would be encountered in a path from point A to point A inside the interior wall surface 50, through the liquid crystal material 20 to point B still within the volumc 21, thence ultimately to point B again. This condition will ensure that there will be a potential difference between point A and point B, which should be large enough to produce an electric field across the liquid crystal material that will tend to align it. It will be appreciated that due to geometrical considerations, namely the length through only the wall from point A to point B, for example, that such a condition can still be met even though the actual impedance of the wall material may be lower than that of the liquid crystal material contained therein. The dielectric constants coefficients of the material of which the encapsulating medium is formed and of which the liquid crystal material is comprised and the effective capacitance values of the capsule wall 54, particularly in a radial direction, and of the liquid crystal material across which the electric field E is imposed should all be so related that the wall 54 of the capsule 22 does not substantially decrease the magnitude of the applied electric field E. A schematic electric circuit diagram representing the circuit across which the electric field E of Fig. 6 is imposed is illustrated in Fig. 7. The electric field is derived from the voltage source 16 when the switch 17 is closed. A capacitor 70 represents the capacitance of the liquid crystal material 20 in the encapsulated liquid crystal 11 when such electric field is applied in the manner illustrated in Fig. 6. The capacitor 71 represents the capacitance of the wall 54 of the capsule 22 at an upper area the direction conveniently referring to the drawing but having no other particular meaning and is, accordingly, curved in a manner similar to that of the upper portion of the capsule 22 of Figs. 5 and 6. The capacitor 72 similarly represents the capacitance of the lower portion of the capsule exposed to the electric field E. The magnitudes of capacitance for each capacitor 70 72 will be a function of the dielectric constant coefficient of the material of which the respective capacitors are formed and of the spacing of the effective plates thereof. It is desirable that the voltage drop occurring across the respective capacitors 71, 72 will be less than the voltage drop across the capacitor 70 the result, then, is application of a maximum portion of the electric field E across the liquid crystal material 20 in the encapsulated liquid crystal 11 for achieving optimized operation, i.e., alignment, of the liquid crystal molecules thereof with a minimum total energy requirement of the voltage source 16. However, it is possible that the voltage drop in one or both capacitors 71, 72 will exceed the voltage drop across capacitor 70 this is operationally acceptable as long as the drop across the capacitor 70 liquid crystal material is great enough to produce an electric field that tends to align the liquid crystal material to and or toward the field on condition of Fig. 6, for example. In connection with capacitor 71, for example, the dielectric material is that of which the wall 54 is formed relatively near the upper portion of the capsule 22. The effective plates of such capacitor 71 are the exterior and interior wall surfaces 73, 50, and the same is true for the capacitor 72 at the lower portion of the capsule 22 relative to the illustration of Fig. 6, for example. By making the wall 54 as thin as possible, while still providing adequate strength for containment of the liquid crystal material 20 in the volume 21, the magnitudes of capacitors 71, 72 can be maximized, especially in comparison to the rather thick or lengthy distance between the upper portion 74 of the liquid crystal material 20 of the lower portion 75 thereof which approximately or equivalently form the plates of the same number of the capacitors 70. The liquid crystal material 20 will have a dielectric constant value that is anisotropic. It is preferable that the dielectric constant coefficient of the wall 54 be no lower than the lower dielectric constant coefficient of the anisotropic liquid crystal material 20 to help meet the above conditions. Since a typical lower dielectric constant for liquid crystal material is about 6. This indicates that the dielectric constant of the encapsulating material is preferably at least about 6. Such value can vary widely depending on the liquid crystal material used, being, for example, as low as about 3.5 and as high as about 8 in the commonly used liquid crystals. The encapsulated liquid crystal 11 has features such that since the liquid crystal structure is distorted and since the pleochroic dye similarly is distorted, absorbency or blockage of light transmission through the encapsulated liquid crystals will be highly effective. On the other hand, due both to the efficient application of an electric field across the liquid crystal material 20 in the encapsulated liquid crystal 11 to align the liquid crystal molecules and the dye along therewith as well as the above described preferred index of refraction matching, i.e., of the encapsulating medium and of the liquid crystal material, so that incident light will not be refracted or bent at the interface between the capsule wall 54 and the liquid crystal material 20 when an electric field is applied, the encapsulated liquid crystal 11 will have a good optically transmissive characteristic. Since a plurality of encapsulated liquid crystals 11 ordinarily is required to construct a final liquid crystal device, such as the device 10 of Fig. 3, and since those encapsulated liquid crystals are ordinarily present in several layers, it is desirable for the liquid crystal material to have a relatively high dielectric anisotropy in order to reduce the voltage requirements for the electric field E. More specifically, the differential between the dielectric constant coefficient for the liquid crystal material 20 when no electric field is applied which constant coefficient should be rather small, and the dielectric constant coefficient for the liquid crystal material when an electric field is applied, which constant coefficient should be relatively large, should be as large as possible consistent with the dielectric of the encapsulating medium. The capsules 22 may be of various sizes. Also, when the capsule size is relatively small, more capsules are required per unit area of the layer 34, and, therefore, more electric voltage drop losses will occur in the encapsulating medium than for larger size capsules, the density per unit area of which would be smaller. Preferably, a device made with the encapsulated liquid crystals 11, such as the liquid crystal device 10 , should use capsules of uniform size so that the device 10 can be energized or deenergized in a relatively uniform and well controlled manner. In contrast, when the capsules are of a non uniform size, the non uniform energization of the respective capsules, i.e., alignment of the liquid crystal molecules of each, would occur upon application of the electric field. Ordinarily the capsules 22 should have a size on the order of from about 1 to about 30 µm in diameter. Currently a suitable liquid crystal material is smectic A phase material S2 sold by BDH Chemical, Pool, England. Another suitable liquid crystal material may be formed by mixing, in the proportions indicated in parenthesis, the following liquid crystals supplied by E. Merck Chemicals, Darmstadt, West Germany K24 18.7 , K30 27 , K36 40.8 , ZLI 1840 6.5 , and CB15 7 . The encapsulating medium forming capsules 22 should be of a type that is substantially completely unaffected by and does not react with or otherwise chemically affect the liquid crystal material. In particular, the liquid crystal material should not be soluble in the encapsulating medium or vice versa. The other characteristics described above concerning dielectric constants coefficients and indices of refraction with respect to the liquid crystal material and to the encapsulating medium also constrain material selection. Moreover, when a pleochroic dye is employed, the encapsulating medium also should be unaffected by and should not affect the dye material. On the other hand, the dye should be soluble in the liquid crystal material and not subject to absorption by the encapsulating medium. Additionally, to achieve the desired relatively high impedance for the encapsulating medium, such medium should have a relatively high level of purity. Especially when the encapsulating medium is prepared as an aqueous dispersion or by ionic polymerization, etc., it is important that the level of ionic conductive impurities should be as low as possible. Examples of pleochroic dyes that may suitably be used in the encapsulated liquid crystals 11 are indophenol blue, Sudan black B, Sudan 3, and Sudan 2, and D 37, D 43 and D 85 by E. Merck identified above. Polyvinyl alcohol PVA , which has been found to have the desired properties mentioned above, may be utilized as an encapsulating medium when the encapsulation is performed by emulsification. PVA has a good, relatively high, dielectric constant and has an index of refraction that is relatively closely matched to that of the preferred liquid crystal material. To purify PVA, the same may be dissolved in water and washed out with alcohol using a precipitation technique. Other techniques also may be used for purifying PVA so that it will have minimum salt or other content that would reduce appreciably the electrical impedance thereof. A preferred purified PVA is Gelvatol sold by Monsanto. If PVA is properly purified, as aforesaid, it will serve well as its own emulsifier and as a wetting agent for facilitating the manufacture of encapsulated liquid crystals according to this method which will be described below. Other types of encapsulating medium may be, for example, gelatin Carbopole a carboxy polymethylene polymer of B.F. Goodrich Chemical Corporation Gantrez polymethyl vinyl ether maleic anhydride of GAF Corporation, preferably reached with water to form the acid, the latter two being polyelectrolytes. These media may be used alone or in combination with other polymers, such as PVA. Other examples and characteristics of several PVA materials are shown in Table I. An emulsion method for making encapsulated liquid crystals 11 may include mixing together the encapsulating medium, the liquid crystal material including, if used, the pleochroic dye material , and perhaps a carrier medium, such as water. Mixing may occur in a variety of mixer devices, such as a blender, a colloid mill, which is most preferred, or the like. What occurs during such mixing is the formation of an emulsion of the ingredients, which subsequently can be dried eliminating the carrier medium, such as water, and satisfactorily curing the encapsulating medium, such as the PVA. Although the capsule 22 of each thusly made encapsulated liquid crystal 11 may not be a perfect sphere, each capsule will be substantially spherical in configuration because a sphere is the lowest free energy state of the individual droplets, globules or capsules of the emulsion, both when originally formed and after drying and or curing has occurred. Another encapsulating medium is latex. Latex may be a suspension of natural rubber or synthetic polymer or copolymer particles. A latex medium is formed by drying a suspension of such particles. A further explanation of the latex medium and methods of making the same are provided in U.S. Patent 4992201. Briefly, latex entrapped liquid crystal may be formed by mixing a suspension of latex particles and liquid crystal material wherein the liquid crystal material has been previously emulsified in an aqueous phase. Alternatively, all components may be combined prior to emulsifying the liquid crystal material. The mixture may then be applied to a substrate. As the mixture dries, it adheres to the substrate. When dried, the latex particles form a latex medium with particles of liquid crystal dispersed therein. It is noted here that the characteristic of the pleochroic dye that it must be soluble in the liquid crystal material and that it not be subject to absorption by the water phase or polymer phase assures that such pleochroic dye will not be absorbed by the PVA, latex or other encapsulating medium or by the carrier medium, such as the water, used during the manufacturing process for the encapsulated liquid crystals 11. A liquid crystal material having a smectic phase was formed by mixing the following liquid crystal materials, available from E. Merck Chemicals, Darmstadt, W. Germany In order to insure good mixing, the components were dissolved in chloroform. The resulting temperature range was The ratio of SLC mixture to PVA matrix was 1 2. The resulting emulsion was coated onto a Mylar film which had been previously evaporated with indium tin oxide ITO . Use of a 2 mil spaced doctor blade resulted in a dry film thickness of .5 mils. The film was laminated to a second piece of ITO coated Mylar, then placed in an oven at 100 C for one hour. The result was a liquid crystal cell which was activated at 100VDC, i.e., it became transparent. When the field was removed, the film remained transparent. Lesser voltages resulted in somewhat fewer degrees of alignment. In all cases, the liquid crystal emulsion remained in a state of activation. When the film was heated to 46 C or above heat to erase , its transition temperature, it returned to its original state, i.e., scattering. Materials and procedure same as in Example 1, and further, M141, a 3 blue dye available from Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan was added to the above mixture, using chloroform as a solvent. When the electric field was applied to the cell, the color changed from dark opaque blue to light transparent blue. Same as Example 2, but a 3 yellow dye G232 from Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals was added. As a result, the cell changed from a dark opaque orange to a light transparent yellow when the electric field was applied. A liquid crystal mixture was made which contained three parts K24 and one part CE3, both liquid crystals available from E. Merck. The resulting material was a smectic C at room temperature 24 C , but became smectic A at 58 . The smectic A became cholesteric at 68.1 . At 76.6 the material became isotropic. When an electric field of 60V was applied to the resulting cell, it became transparent and the transparency remained until it was heated to about 76.6 . The quantities of ingredients for making the encapsulated liquid crystals 11, for example in the manner described above, may be, as follows The PVA The quantity of PVA in the solution should be on the order of from about 5 to about 50 , and possibly even greater depending on the hydrolysis and molecular weight of the PVA, and preferably, as described above, about 22 . For example, if the PVA has too large a molecular weight, the resulting material will be like glass, especially if too much PVA is used in the solution. On the other hand, if the molecular weight is too low, use of too little PVA will result in too low a viscosity of the material, and the resulting emulsion solidify adequately to the desired spherical encapsulated liquid crystals. Carrier medium The remainder of the solution would be water or other, preferably volatile, carrier medium, as described above, with which the emulsion can be made and the material laid down appropriately on a substrate, electrode or the like. A method of making latex entrapped smectic liquid crystal may comprise adding .03 grams of the surfactant Igepol C0720 available through GAF, N.Y., NY and .03 grams of the surfactant DOW 5098 available through Dow Chemical, Midland, Michigan to 2.09 grams of S2 smectic liquid crystal material available through BDH Chemical, Pool, England , and thereafter heating the composition to its isotropic temperature to dissolve it. The mixture may then be cooled to room temperature 24 C and .5 grams of MeCl₂ added to dissolve it. Then, 3.0 grams of Neorez R 967 available through Polyvinyl Chemicals, Wilmington, Mass. containing 40 of latex particles by weight may be added and mixed with an impeller blade at 2400 RPM for 3 minutes. Thereafter, .2 grams of a 5 solution of the cross linking agent Tyzor LA available through DuPont, Wilmington, Del. is added with slow mixing at about 300 RPM. The resulting temperature range was Same as Example 5 but a 1 B1 blue dye available through E. Merck was added to the 32 liquid crystal material. As a result, when an electric field was applied, the color changed from opaque blue to light transparent blue. It will be appreciated that since the uncured capsules or droplets of encapsulating medium and liquid crystal material are carried in a liquid, various conventional or other techniques may be employed to grade the capsules according to size so that the capsules can be reformed if of an undesirable size by feeding again through the mixing apparatus, for example, and so that the finally used capsules will be of a desired uniformity for the reasons expressed above. Although an encapsulation technique has been described with reference to emulsification, since the fact that the encapsulant material and binder are the same makes facile the production of liquid crystal devices the preparation of discrete capsules of the liquid crystal material may on occasion be advantageous, and the use of such discrete capsules with a binder is within the contemplated scope of this invention. Although certain specific embodiments of the invention have been described herein in detail, the invention is not to be limited only to such embodiments, but rather only by the appended claims.
