# Methane conversion.

## Abstract
A method for the oxidative conversion of a feed material comprising methane, such as natural gas, to higher hydrocar bons, particularly ethylene and ethane and desirably ethylene, in which feed is contacted with a solid contact mate rial comprising cobalt at least one metal selected from the group consisting of zirconium, zinc, niobium, indium, lead and bismuth, preferably, zirconium phosphorous at least one Group IA metal and oxygen under oxidative conversion conditions sufficient to convert the methane to the higher hydrocarbons. Substantial improvement in the conversion of methane and selectivity to ethylene and ethane is obtained by adding chlorine to the contact material. The further addition of sulfur to the contact material also improves the conversion and selectivity and permits the method to be carried out in an essentially continuous manner in the presence of a free ox ygen containing gas.
