# Coupling devices for use with electrofusion fittings of thermoplastic material.

## Abstract
A coupling device 1 for use with an electrofusion fitting 14 so as to identify the fitting and to provide an indication of the period of time for which such fittings should be electrically energised to provide a satisfactory bond to thermoplastic pipes, the device comprising relatively rotat able parts 2 and 3 which are brought into register with fixed identification locations 18 and 19 on the fitting, and when in register automatically select an electrical parameter which is representative of that particular fittitig and the energisation period required.
