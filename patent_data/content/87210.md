# A rotational moulding process using polyethylene compositions.

## Abstract
A composition particularly adapted for use in a rotation al moulding process is disclosed. The composition compris es polyethylene having a density of 0.920 0.970 g cmÂ³ and a melt index of 10 35 dg min., 0.3 1.3 by weight of a bis tert. alkyl peroxyalkyl benzene, 0.2 1.5 by weight of a co curing agent selected from triallyl cyanurate, triallyl isocyanurate and 1,2 polybutadiene, 0.01 0.05 by weight of a hindered phenolic antioxidant and 0.01 0.2 by weight of a secondary antioxidant. The preferred secondary antiox idant is tris di tert. butyl phenyl phosphite. The composition may be used in for example, the moulding of tanks, barrels, containers and the like.
