# Method and apparatus for detecting position and velocity of moving body.

## Abstract
A method for detecting the position and the velocity by using an encoder mounted directly on a moving body wherein original signals of the encoder are pulse width modulated by using a sampling carrier wave and the posi tion is detected by measuring the width of the pulses T
