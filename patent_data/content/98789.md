# Soundproofing panel mounted to effect vibration isolation.

## Abstract
A rigid soundproofing panel 12 is supported from a vibration prone wall 10 through a support assembly 16 which includes an elastomeric plate isolator 24 of selected spring rate to tune the suspension system so that minimal wall vibrations are imparted to the soundproofing panel 12 , and a second elastomeric member in parallel with the first in the form of an acoustic edge seal 30 extending between the wall 10 and the soundproofing panel 12 throughout the full periphery of the soundproofing panel 12 so as to prevent acoustic flanking therebetween and being of substantially reduced spring rate as compared to that of the elastomeric plate isolator 24 so as not to interfere with system tuning.
