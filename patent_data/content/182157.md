Antibiotic L 17046 is disclosed in European Patent Application No. 84102665. It is prepared by controlled hydrolysis of teicoplanin, another known antibiotic substance which is described in US Patent 4,239,751. Teicoplanin is the international non proprietary name INN of the antibiotic substance formerly named teichomycin which is obtained by cultivating the strain In addition, it has been found that it is possible to transform teicoplanin, a pure factor thereof or a mixture of any of said factors in any proportion, into unitary antibiotic products by means of selective hydrolysis of one or two sugar moieties. They are named antibiotic L 17054 and antibiotic L 17046, respectively. Antibiotic L 17054 is represented by the above formula I wherein A, R and R¹ are hydrogen atoms, B is N acetyl β D glucosaminyl and M is α D mannosyl wherein the sugar moieties are linked to the peptidic nucleus through an O glycosidic bond. It is described in European Patent Application No. 84102666. Antibiotic L 17046 is represented by the above formula I wherein A, M, R and R¹ are hydrogen atoms, and B is N acetyl β D glucosaminyl wherein the sugar moiety is linked to the peptidic nucleus through an O glycosidic bond. It is described in European Patent Application No. 84102665. All the above named compounds, i.e. teicoplanin, a teicoplanin factor, a mixture of any said factors in any proportion, antibiotic L 17054 and antibiotic L 17046 are starting materials for the preparation of the ester derivatives of the invention. To facilitate the discussion, in the present specification any one of the above starting materials, i.e. teicoplanin complex as obtained according to U.S. patent 4,239,751, any further purification thereof, a compound of the above formula I wherein R and R¹ are hydrogen, A represents hydrogen or a C₁₀ C₁₁ aliphatic acyl β D glucosaminyl, B represents N acetyl β D glucosaminyl, and M represents hydrogen or α D mannosyl with the proviso that when A is hydrogen also M is hydrogen, or any mixture thereof in any proportion will be generally referred to as a teicoplanin like compound or a teicoplanin like substance . The antibiotic L 17046 esters of formula I are prepared by submitting a suitable teicoplanin like substance to esterification under controlled conditions. These esterification conditions depend on the nature of the specific teicoplanin like substance which is used as the starting material and, to a certain extent, on the specific ester which is desired. It will be recognized by those skilled in the art that the free aminic function of the teicoplanin like substrates may interfere with the reaction course and therefore in some instances it will be necessary to protect this amino function before starting the esterification process. As it is appreciated by the skilled technician, the ultimate choice of the specific N protecting group depends on the characteristics of the particular ester which is desired. In fact, this ester should be stable at the condition of removal of the N protecting groups. Since the conditions of removal of the different N protecting groups are known, the skilled technician is capable of selecting the proper protecting group. For instance, where a benzyl ester is desired, the N protecting groups which are removable by catalytic hydrogenation, such as the benzyloxycarbonyl group, should be avoided, while those N protecting groups which are removable under mild acidic conditions, such as t.butoxycarbonyl, can be conveniently used. More particularly, controlled esterification procedures useful for preparing the antibiotic L 17046 ester derivatives of the invention include esterification reactions which employ acidic alcoholic conditions either in the presence of a N protected teicoplanin like derivative or preferably in the presence of a free teicoplanin like derivative esterification reactions wherein the teicoplanin like substrate is treated with an excess of an acidic solution of the selected alcohol, which has to be a liquid at the reaction temperature esterification reactions of a N protected antibiotic L 17046 derivative with a suitable alcoholic substrate such as phenol or substituted phenol in the presence of a suitable activating agent of the carboxy function and esterification procedures wherein an alkali metal, silver or lead salt of a N protected antibiotic L 17046 derivative in an inert organic solvent is reacted with a halogenide of formula R X, wherein R is as previously defined but with the exclusion of the halogenoalkyl groups, and X is a chlorine or preferably bromine or iodine atom, optionally in the presence of a tertiary amine such as triethylamine, picoline and the like. A general procedure for preparing esters of formula I wherein the alcoholic residue is a residue of a alcohol which is a liquid at the reaction temperature and slightly water soluble or practically water insoluble, comprises, therefore, reacting a teicoplanin like compound with a solution of the suitably selected alcohol in the presence of a mineral acid, preferably a hydrogen halide. The reaction temperature is preferably between 50 and 80 C. Preferred hydrogen halides are hydrogen bromide and hydrogen chloride with hydrogen chloride as the first choice.

A further general procedure for preparing the compounds of the invention, with the exception of those wherein R is a halogeno C₁ C₁₂ alkyl group, phenyl and substituted phenyl group, comprises reacting a N protected L 17046, either in the non salt form and in the presence of a hydrogen halide acceptor or in the form of the alkali metal K, Na , silver, lead salt, with a halogenide derivative of formula RX, wherein R is as above with the exclusion of halogeno C₁ C₁₂ alkyl phenyl and substituted phenyl and X is chlorine or preferably bromine and iodine in an inert organic polar aprotic solvent. The reaction temperature is from about 5 C to 50 C. Preferably it is 15 to 50 C. The N protected antibiotic L 17046 ester derivative is then N deprotected according to the techniques outlined above or otherwise known in the art. Still another procedure for preparing the compounds of the invention comprises reacting a carboxy activated N protected L 17046 derivative with a suitable alcohol in an inert organic solvent. Some chloroalkyl esters, namely the 3 chloropropyl, 4 chlorobutyl, 5 chloropentyl, 6 chlorohexyl, 4 chloropentyl, 4 chloro 3 methylbutyl, and 5 chloro 4 methylpentyl esters may be prepared also by reacting antibiotic L 17046 respectively with oxetane, tetrahydrofurane, tetrahydropyrane, oxepane, 2 methyl tetrahydrofurane, 3 methyl tetrahydrofurane, 3 methyltetrahydropyrane in the presence of bubbling hydrogen chloride. The reaction temperature is preferebly between 30 and 60 C. The reaction is generally completed in 4 24 h. It will be recognized by those skilled in the art that the reaction time in the above reported esterification procedures varies depending on the specific reaction conditions and on the starting materials which are employed however, since the compounds of the invention as well as the teicoplanin like starting materials can be easily detected by autobioassay, TLC or HPLC methods, the skilled technician is also capable of monitoring the reaction course and determining when it is completed. An example of the way in which the reaction course may be monitored by HPLC is as follows The relative retention times of some representative compounds of the invention in the above system are reported in Table Ia. Another example of HPLC analytical procedure is the following The relative retention times of some representative compounds of the invention in above system are reported in Table Ib. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the compounds of the invention can be prepared either from an essentially pure teicoplanin like substance or from a crude teicoplanin like substance. In the former case, a compound of the invention can be obtained which may not need further particular purification step, while in the latter case a final purification step is necessary. A preferred procedure includes a first reverse phase chromatography on silanized silica gel 0.06 0.2 mm developing with a linear step gradient of 5 to 60 acetonitrile in 0.2 aqueous ammonium formate and a second column chromatography which uses a mixture of acetonitrile water, 6 4 v v , as the eluent.
