# Surface preparation of nickel base alloys for brazing.

## Abstract
In order to remove undesirable oxides from the surface of nickel base or nickel iron base alloys containing oxidiz able aluminium and or titanium prior to brazing, the alloy is heated in an oxygen containing atmosphere at an elevated temperature for a time sufficient to form on the alloy surface a bilayered film comprised of a first oxide top layer containing at least titanium or aluminium and a second layer beneath the first comprised of the alloy composition substantially depleted of aluminium and or titanium. The surface of the alloy is cleaned to remove the first oxide layer whereupon the remaining surface is in condition for brazing.
