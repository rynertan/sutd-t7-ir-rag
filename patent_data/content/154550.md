## Description
Monoclonal antibodies capable of binding to pancreatic carcinoma of ductal origin This invention concerns monoclonal antibodies that recognize an antigen present on human pancreatic carcinomas. Also of concern are the hybridoma cell lines that secrete the antibodies, as well as tracer labelled antibodies and antibody fragments, and diagnostic and therapeutic processes that employ the antibodies or antibody fragments of this invention. The immune response to entry of a foreign substance into the body consists of secretion by plasma cells of antibodies which are immunoglobulin Ig molecules with combining sites that recognize particular determinants on the surface of the foreign substance, or antigen, and bind to them. Usually, the antibody Ab response to an antigen Ag is heterogeneous. Upon injection of a body with an immunogen, the body manufactures large numbers of antibodies directed against various components of the antigens and even against various determinant sites on the antigen. It is difficult to separate various antibodies and, thus, conventional antisera contain mixtures of antibodies. It has long been a goal to design a source of antibodies that recognize and combine with specific antigen determinants. One aspect of hybridoma technology concerns the fusion of myeloma cells with lymphocytes from animals which have been immunized with a particular antigen. Hybridomas manufacture monoclonal antibodies that are specific against a single antigen determinant.Monoclonal antibodies are beginning to replace conventional antisera in standard diagnostic kits for such procedures as radioimmunoassays. Significant work is also being done to adapt hybridoma technology for therapeutic purposes. Some properties of an ideal fused cell line are 1 high cloning efficiency 2 the ability to grow rapidly in a serum medium 3 no secretion of myeloma Ig 4 stable production of large amounts of Ig after fusion and 5 ability to grow when reinserted into the originating species.Immunoglobulin is the generic name for various types of antibodies that include IgG, IgM, IgE, and IgD. The various species of Ig have similarities and differences. For example, all molecules ofIgG have a constant biological end, sometimes called the leg. However, the immunological ends, sometimes called the arms, will vary according to the antigen determinant which the IgG recognizes. A typical procedure for making hybridomas is as follows a immunize mice with a certain immunogen b remove the spleens from the immunized mice and make a spleen suspension in an appropriate medium c fuse the suspended spleen cells with mouse myeloma cells d dilute and culture in separate containers the mixture of unfused spleen cells, unfused myeloma cells and fused cells in a selective medium which will not support growth of the unfused myeloma cells e evaluate the supernatant in each container containing a hybridoma for the presence of antibody to the immunogen and f select and clone hybridomas producing the desired antibodies.Once the desired hybridoma has been selected and cloned, the resultant antibody may be produced by in vitro culturing of the desired hybridoma in a suitable medium. In an alternative method, the desired hybridoma can be injected directly into mice to yield concentrated amounts of antibody. Hybridomas produced by fusion of murine spleen cells and murine myeloma cells have been described in the literature by Kohler et al., in Eur. J.Immunol. 6, 511 519 1976 by Milstein et al., in Nature 266, 550 1977 and by Walsh, Nature, 266, 495 1977 . The technigue is also set out in some detail by Herzenberg and Milstein, in Handbook on ExperimentalImmunology , ed. Weir Blackwell Scientific, London , 1979, pages 25.1 to 25.7. Additional references for hybridoma methodology are provided in MonoclonalAntibodies Plenum Press, 1980, R. Kennett, J. McKearn and K. Bectol eds. Patents relating to monoclonal antibodies against human tumours produced by hybridoma technology include U.S. Patents 4,182,124 and 4,196,265.Representative of the art concerning monoclonal antibodies that have specificity for antigens on carcinoma cells are U.S. patent 4,349,528 and U.S.patent 4,350,683. In relation to the parent myeloma cell line employed for the fusion event in the example described herein, see Kearney et al, Immunol., 123, 15481550 1978 Cancer of the pancreas is often a fatal disease and currently ranks fourth among causes of death due to cancer. The major obstacle in diagnosis, management and treatment of pancreatic cancer is tbss lack of an effective method for early detection.Related publications disclosing monoclonal antibodies tc pancreatic tumor cells include Metzgar et al.,Ca Res., 42, 601 608 1982 and Herlyn et al., J. Clin. Immunol. 2 2 135 140 1982 . According to one aspect of the present invention, we provide a monoclonal antibody which reacts with pancreatic carcinoma of ductal origin1 but not with one r more cell types selected from neoplastic pancreatic cells of endocrine origin, regenerative pancreatic cells, panceeatitis cells and normal pancreatic cells. A hybridoma which secretes a monoclonal antibody according to the invention may be prepared by a process which comprises immunizing an animal, for example a mouse, with lung adenocarcinoma cells, for example, A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells, fusing spleen cells from the immunized animal with non immunoglobulin secreting myeloma cells and selecting a hybridoma which secretes a monoclonal antibody having the desired binding specificity. The preparation of the hybridoma cell line 47D10, which secretes a monoclonal antibody according to the invention capable of distinguishing neoplastic pancreatic cells of ductal origin from neoplastic pancreatic cells of endocrine origin, regenerative pancreatic cells, pancreatitis cells and normal pancreatic cells, is described in detail below by way of example. The aforesaid hybridoma cell line was deposited in the ATCC under accession number HB8504 on 2,4 February 1984. Balb c x C57BL 6 mice were immunized with viable A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells derived from bronchioalveolar cancer and mouse spleen cells isolated from an immunized mouse were fused with mouse myeloma cells. The culture supernatants from the resulting hybridomas were screened by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA and the hybridoma designated 47D10 was selected whose monoclonal antibody exhibited reactivity for the immunogenA549 cells, but not for normal embryonic lung fibroblast cells. After cloning in soft agar, the 47D1Q hybridoma was grown in the peritoneal cavity of Balb c xC57BL 6 mice to produce ascites fluid. The monoclonal antibody hereinafter referred to as 47D10 antibody was purified from ascites fluid and evaluated by fixed and live cell ELISA to determine the range of tumor cell reactivity. The antibody was found to be an IgGl kappa molecule. Normal and neoplastic human tissues were surveyed by immunoperoxidase tech niques to determine the immunoreactivity of this mono clonal antibody. In routine paraffin embedded formalinfixed material, the antibody demonstrated cell surface and cytoplasmic immunoreactivity in tumour cells of 38 out of 40 pancreatic carcinomas.Immunizations Balb c x C57BL 6 mice were immunized intraperitoneally with 1x107 viable A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells. Four months later, mouse num 1074 was boosted with an intraperitoneal inoculation of lx107 viableA549 cells. Spleens were removed for cell fusion 3 days later.Hybridoma Methodology Three days after the intraperitoneal boost, the spleen of mouse 1074 was removed and isolated spleen cells were fused with non secretor myeloma cells of the cell line P3x63Ag8.653, ATCC Accession CRL 1580, see Kearney et al., Jour. of lmm. 123, 1548 1550 1979 . More particularly, after sacrifice of the mouse, spleen cells suspensions were prepared in serumless DMEM high glucose medium. Spleen cells from mouse mouse 1074 were mixed with myeloma cells at a ratio of 4 1 in a conical centrifuge tube. This cell mixture was centrifuged at 1200xg for 10 min at room temperature. After removal of the supernatant, the cells were resuspended by tapping the tube.The fusion procedure was initiated by adding 1.0 ml of 50 w v polyethylene glycol 1000 Baker at 370C over a 30 second period. The cells were occasionally mixed with a pipette tip for 90 seconds and 5 ml of serumless DMEM high glucose medium was added over a 3 minute period. This was followed by the addition of 14 ml of DMEM high glucose medium supplemented with fetal calf serum, non essential amino acids, L glutamine, hypoxanthine, aminopterin and thymidine referred to as HAT medium . The HAT medium was added over a 1 minute period.Total volume was then adjusted to 50 ml with HAT medium and the cells were centrifuged at 800xg for 10 minutes at room temperature. Supernatants were aspirated and the cell pellet disrupted with 10 ml of HAT medium. 2x106 peritoneal cells Balb c xC57BL 6 were added and the final volume adjusted to 50 ml. Cells were then pipetted into 96 well microtiter plates at a final concentration of 2x105 spleen cells per well. Approximately 14 days later, tissue culture supernatants from wells containing hybridoma colonies were tested for binding to methanolfixed A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells with the enzymelinked immunosorbent assay ELISA procedure.To accomplish this, 5x104 A549 cells were grown in 96 well polyvinyl chloride microtiter plates overnight and fixed to the dishes with 1008 methanol.Hybridoma supernatants 0.05 ml were added to wells containing A549 or normal control cells and incubated overnight at 4 C. Hybridoma 47D10 ATCC HB8504 supernatant was selected for fixed cell and live cell ELISA studies, and immunoperoxidase staining cell studies, all discussed below.Fixed Cell ELISA Supernatant from hybridoma 47D10 ATCC flHB8504 was added to wells having normal and tumour cell lines Table 1 fixed thereto and incubated overnight at 4 C. Hybridoma supernatant was then removed by aspiration and the wells were washed three times with phosphate buffer saline PBS containing 1 w v bovine serum albumin BSA . Each well subsequently received 0.1 ml of the phosphate buffered saline bovine serum albumin PBS BSA diluted goat antimouse IgG antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase GAMHRP diluted 1 500 in PBS BSA. Cells were incubated for 60 minutes at 37 C. GAMHRP was removed after incubation and each well washed twice with distilled water.The presence of bound GAMHRP was determined by adding 0.1 ml of the substrate of HRP, 0.2 w v o phenylenediamine OPD in phosphate buffer 0.009M citric acid, 0.03M K2HP04 containing 0.15 hydrogen peroxide. BRP in combination with its substrate results in a yellow coloured product.Development of the product was allowed to occur at room temperature for 15 minutes and the enzymatic reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.1 ml of 4.5 M H2SO4. Measurement of the resultant reaction product was accomplished by determining optical density OD at 488 nm. Presence of yellow colour in the wells indicated that mouse antibody was present in the hybridoma supernatant which could bind an antigen on the cells present and that the mouse antibody could be recognized by the GAMHRP reagent. flybridoma 47D10 was then cloned in soft agar by standard techniques.Ascites Production After 2 agar clonings of hybridoma 47D10, ascites fluid containing the antibody was produced in Balb c x C57BL 6 mice. Mice were primed with 0.5 ml of Pristane by intraperitoneal i.p. injection two weeks prior to inoculation with 2x106 cloned 47D10 hybridoma cells. Two or three weeks later, the ascites fluid was removed and the presence of A549 reactive monoclonal antibody was determined using the ELISA procedure previously described.Antibody Purification from Ascites Fluid To the mouse ascites fluid at 4 C was added an equivalent amount of saturated ammonium sulphate.This material was stirred at 40C for l hour and the precipitate collected by centrifugation. The precipatate was dissolved in distilled water and dialyzed against 100 volumes of 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, at 40C. This partially purified antibody was then purified to a single subclass by protein A Sepharose chromatography Pharmacia according to the procedure of Ey. Prowse and Jenkin, lmmunochemistry, 15 429 1978 .Live Cell ELtSA Normal and tumour cell lines Table 1 which grow attached to plastic were detached from plastic tissue culture flasks by using standard trypsinization procedures. Cells were seeded in 96 well, flat bottom tissue culture plates at 5x104 viable cells per well and incubated overnight at 37 C in a humidified incubator. After overnight incubation, medium was aspirated and 0.2 ml of a phosphate buffered saline bovine serum albumin PBS BSA blocking buffer final concentration of BSA was 58 was added to each well for a 60 minute incubation at 37 C. Blocking buffer was aspirated and each well washed three times using RPMI 1640 medium containing 1t BSA. Purified 47D10 antibody was added at a concentration of 0.4 pg ml to each well for a 60 minute incubation.After incubation, the wells were washed with RPMI 1640 medium containing 1 BSA. Each well received Q.1 ml of GAMHPP for 60 minutes at 37 C. The GAMHRP was aspirated, wells were washed three times with RPMI 1640 18 BSA,OPD added and colour development measured as previously described for the fixed cell ELISA. Immunohistochemistry by Immunoperoxidase Staining Six micron sections of formalin fixed human tissue on slides were used. Fixed tissues were deparaffinized in xylene for 30 minutes at 60 C followed by a 30 minute incubation in xylene at room temperature. Tissues were placed in 1008 ethanol followed by incubation with 958 alcohol. In order to block or eliminate endogenous peroxidase activity, tissue sections were incubated for 30 minutes in a 0.2 hydrogen peroxide in methanol mixture. Tissue sections were thoroughly rinsed in water followed by washing in PBS. Tissues received 4 drops or normal horse serum for a 30 minute incubation to block nonspecific sticking. The monoclonal antibody secreted by hybridoma 47D10 ATCC HB8504 was applied and the tissue sections stored overnight at 26C. After overnight incubation, the tissue sections were washed 3 times in PBS and then incubated for 30 minutes with biotinylated anti mouse reagents.They were then washed with PBS and incubated for 30 minutes with avidin biotinylated horseradish peroxidase complex, rinsed in PBS three times and reacted with diaminobenzidine and hydrogen peroxide for 5 minutes. Following this, the tissue sections were rinsed in PBS, counterstained with hematoxylin for 30 seconds and dehydrated. Dehydration was carried out by dipping sections in 80 ethanol for 1 minute, in 95 ethanol for 5 minutes, in 100 ethanol for 5 minutes and in xylene for 10 minutes. Slides were then mounted and examined by microscope to determine the presence of a brownish precipitate which indicates the presence of 47D10 antibody.ELISA Results The fixed cell ELISA results for the monoclonal antibody of hybridoma 47D10 ATCC ssHB8504 summarized in Table 1 show significant antibody binding to the immunogen A549 and the colon cell line WiDr.Studies examining surface binding of the same antibody to live cells also summarized in Table 1 demonstrated binding to A549, MCF 7, MDA.MB.231, G361 and WiDr cells. Normal fibroblast lines were unreactive.Additional studies with a lung squamous cell carcinoma line, SW900, showed significant binding to both fixed and live tumour cells.Immunohistochemical Results To define specificity and range of reactivity, 47D10 monoclonal antibody was evaluated on a variety of human normal and neoplastic tissue sections that were embedded in paraffin. In routine paraffinembedded formalin fixed material, the monoclonal antibody demonstrated cell surface and cytoplasmic immunoreactivity with tumour cells of 38 out of 40 pancreatic carcinomas, including pancreatic papillary cystadenocarcinomas as well as both well and poorly differentiated carcinomas of ductal origin Table II . Pancreatic endocrine tumors were consistently unreactive. Regenerative ductal epithelial seen in chronic pancreatitis as well as normal pancreatic ductal acinar and islet cell constitutents were consistently unreactive.Survey of a variety of normal tissues lung, pancreas, liver, heart, spleen, kidney, lymph node, bone marrow, cerebral cortex of the brain, skin and adrenal cortex showed no reactivity. Neoplastic tissues showed immunoreactivity in 5 out of 8 lung and 8 out of 11 colon adenocarcinomas. However, in the case of breast malignancy frozen sections this monoclonal antibody showed significant reactivity with infiltrating ductal carcinoma Table II with no reactivity with fibrocystic disease of the breast.This monoclonal antibody was also capable of detecting small numbers of metastatic pancreatic tumour cells in lymph nodes by immunoperoxidase staining. This antibody was also able to distinguish neoplastic pancreatic tissue from regenerative pancreatic ductal structure, from normal tissue and from pancreatitis. The monoclonal antibody 47D10 and other monoclonal antibodies according to the invention are useful in the diagnosis of primary and metastatic pancreatic tumour cells by conventional in vivo diagnostic methods. Diagnosis may also be carried out by conventional in vitro diagnostic procedures such as the assay of human blood samples or other body fluids. In these procedures, any of the tracerlabels can be utilized e.g. radiolabels, NMR contrast agents, fluorescents, phosphorescents, chemiluminescents, and bioluminescents .The in situ detection by gamma scanning of primary or metastatic pancreatic tumour cells may be effected by coupling the 471 10 monoclonal antibody or another monoclonal antibody according to the invention with appropriate specificity to a radioactive compound by any of the well known techniques, for example, by utilizing a DTPA chelator.Further, the treatment of primary or metastatic pancreatic cancer using the monoclonal antibody 47D10 or another suitable monoclonal antibody according to the invention can be effected by coupling the antibody to a toxic compound or a therapeutic radioactive isotope.Diagnosis may also be carried out by the evaluation of human tissue sections using the same antibodies and the immunohistochemical technique of immunoperoxidase staining. In all the above mentioned procedures, fragments of monoclonal antibodies according to the invention, comprising an immunological end having an antigen recognition site of appropriate specificity, may also be used. By using appropriate monoclonal antibodies of the present invention or antigen recognising fragments of such antibodies, the detection of micro lesions containing only a few tumour cells, that would not ordinarily be detected by conventional staining techniques, is now possible.
