# Cam valve self centering seat.

## Abstract
A fluid valve capable of operation in high pressure, bidirectional flowpaths includes a chamber having a circular port in which an axially and radially movable seat ring is engaged by an eccentrically movable valve plug having a spherically convex sealing surface. The plug is mounted to a valve shaft supported in the body for rotation about an axis transverse to, but offset from, the centerline of the port. The seat ring, body and a retainer ring include among them a pair of annular channels for retaining a pair of seals adapted for improving their sealing action with pressure.
