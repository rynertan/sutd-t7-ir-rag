## Description
HETEROCYCLIC DERIVATIVES This invention relates to new heterocyclic derivatives and more particularly it relates to new dihydropyridine derivatives which possess antihypertensive properties. Many 2,6 dialkyl 4 aryl l,4 dihydropyridine 3,5 dicarboxylate derivatives are known which inhibit the movement of calcium ions in the cardiovascular system of warm blooded animals, and which thereby produce an antihypertensive effect. The most used of these is nifedipine, which is dimethyl l,4 dihydro 2,6 dimethyl 4 o nitrophenylpyridine 3,5 dicarboxylate. Also known are many l aryloxy 3 amino propan 2 ol derivatives which possess beta adrenergic receptor blocking properties and which also produce an antihypertensive effect. Two of the most used of these are propranolol and atenolol, which are respectively l naphth l yloxy and l p carbamoylmethylphenoxy 3 isopropylaminopropan 2 ol. The only described attempt to combine these two types of chemical structure into one molecule is reported by Merck workers in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 1981, Vol. 24, pages 628 to 631, in which a 3 ami no 2 hydroxypropoxy subst ituent was introduced into the 4 aryl substituent of a 4 aryl l,4 aihydropyridine derivative, without much success in producing a compound with antihypertensive activity of the type sought by the authors. Since the priority date of the present application two documents have been publishea which describe closely related compounds to those of the present invention. These are European Specification No. 151066 in the name of the Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co.Ltd., and Japanese Specification No. 60 136558 Derwent Abstract Reference No. 85 213756 35 in the name of Teikoku Hormone Manufacturing Ltd. We have now found that compounds which do possess useful antihypertensive activity may be obtained by suitably combining a 3 aryloxy 2 hydroxypropylamino moiety with a 1,4 dihydropyridine moiety. According to the present invention there is provided a dihydropyridine of the formula EMI2.1 wherein R1 is alkyl or alkoxyalkyl each of up to 6 carbon atoms wherein R2 and R3, which may be the same or different, each is alkyl of up to 6 carbon atoms, wherein benzene ring A bears one or more substituents selected from halogeno, cyano, nitro, trifluoromethyl and alkyl of up to 6 carbon atoms or bears the subst ituent N O N attached to the 2 and 3 positions that is, to torm a benzo 2,1,3 oxadiazole nucleus wherein Ar is phenyl, naphthyl, tetrahydronaphthyl, indanyl or indenyl which is unsubstituted or which bears one or more substituents selected from halogeno, trifluoromethyl, hydroxy, amino, nitro, carbamoyl and cyano, and alkyl, alkenyl, alkoxy, alkenyloxy, alkoxyalkoxy, alkylthio, alkanoyl, carbamoylalkyl and alkanoylamino each of up to 6 carbon atoms or Ar is a 5 or 6 membered heterocyclic ring containing 1, 2 or 3 heteroatoms selected from oxygen, nitroyen and sulphur, which ring is saturated or unsaturated, which ring is unsubstituted or bears one or more substituents selected from oxo, halogeno, trifluoromethyl, phenyl and morpholino, and alkyl and alkoxy each of up to 6 carbon atoms, and arylalkyl of up to 12 carbon atoms, and which ring may also be fused to a benzene ring, Ar being joined to the rest of the molecule either from the heterocyclic ring or from the fused benzene ring wherein p is O or 1 wherein X is O or NH and wherein Y is straight or branched chain alkylene of 2 to 12 carbon atoms which may optionally be interrupted by one or two groups selected from oxygen 0 , sulphur S , imino and substituted imino NR4 wherein R4 is hydrogen, alkyl or alkanoyl each of up to 10 carbon atoms, phenyl or aralkyl of up to 12 carbon atoms , phenylene, substituted phenylene, pyridylene, cycloalkylene of up to 6 carbon atoms, 1,4piperazinediyl, l,4 piperidinediyl and amido CONH or NHCO groups or an acid addition salt thereof.

As stated above, the dihydropyridine derivatives of the invention possess antihypertensive aotivity. This may be aemonstrated by the ability of the compound to reduce the blood pressure of a spontaneously hypertensive rat, or of a rat made hypertensive by treatment with deoxycorticosterone acetate, or of a dog made hypertensive by the Goldblatt technique of unilateral nephrectomy and clipping of the contralateral kidney. These are all standard tests used to demonstrate antihypertensive effects of medicaments. Some of the dihydropyridine derivatives of the invention possess beta adrenergic blocking properties, some of them possess calcium ion slow channel blocking properties and some of them possess both such activities. A preferred dihydropyridine derivative of the invention possesses both such activities. Beta adrenergic blocking activity may be demonstrated in vivo by the ability of the compound to inhibit isoprenaline induced tachycardia in a rat or cat, or in vitro by shifting to the right the dose response curve of a guinea pig atrium to isoprenaline. Calcium ion slow channel blocking activity may be demonstrated in vitro by the ability of the compound to reduce spontaneous contraction in a rat portal vein preparation. These also are all standard tests used to demonstrate the stated activities. Because of the beta adrenergic blocking and or calcium slow channel blocking properties a dihydro pyridine of the invention may also be useful in the treatment of heart diseases such as angina pectoris and cardiac arrhythmias.
