# Preparation of immunogens consisting of antigens and or antigenic determinants bound to glycoside containing carriers.

## Abstract
The invention concerns a method for the preparation of immunogens comprising reacting at least one type of anti gens or antigenic determinants which are for example of polypeptide, oligosaccharide or oligonucleotide nature, with carrier complexes consisting of glycosides having a hyd rophilic and a hydrophobic part and hydrophobic compounds provided with one or more groups which show reactivity towards said antigens or antigenic determinants. These immunogens are useful as vaccines, and as immunochemical reagents. Prior to use the immunogens may be stabilized e.g., by cross linking of the antigens or antigenic determinants and or be protected against digestive degradation e.g. by micro or macro encapsulation .
