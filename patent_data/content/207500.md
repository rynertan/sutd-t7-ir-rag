## Description
The present invention relates to novel isoquinoline derivatives and therapeutically acceptable addition salts thereof. These isoquinoline derivatives and their addition salts are useful for cardiotonic agents. In the treatment of heart failure, digitalis preparations, such as digoxin, digitoxin, and the like, have been used as cardiotonic agents see, for example, IYAKUHIN YORAN Summary of Pharmaceuticals , 1977, YAKUGYO JIHO SHA, Tokyo, Japan, pp. 324 327. On the other hand, different compounds having cardiotonic activity have also been reported for example, nicotinonitrile derivatives in e.g. Japanese Patent Application Laying open No. 57 70868, imidazolone derivatives in e.g. Japanese Patent Application Laying open No. 59 155368, dihydropyridazinone derivatives in e.g. Japanese Patent Application Laying open No. 58 74679. The digitalis preparations presently used in the treatment require skill on being administered due to their narrow safety margin. Also, there is a problem of side effect such as arrythmia. On the other hand, the recently reported nicotinonitrile, imidazolone and dihydropyridazinone derivates have a number of disadvantages, such as low cardiontonic activity, narrow safety margin, increase in the number of myocardial rhythm upon administration thereof, and high animal toxicity. Thus WO A 84 756 mentions 5 bicyclic nitrogen heteroaryl pyrid 2 ones and their use for increasing cardiac contractillity. The Journal of Organic Chemistry, 1968, pgs. 3648 5 mentions 5,6,7,8 tetrahydro iso quinoline derivatives having cyano groups in 3 and 4 positions. The object of the present invention is to provide cardiontonic compounds having wide safety margin and no side effect with simultaneously high cardiontonic activity and low toxicity. The present invention solves this object by offering the Isochinoline derivatives represented by the general formula wherein R₁ denotes a hydrogen or halogen atom, or a nitro or acetyl group, and R₂ denotes a hydrogen atom, or a methyl, methoxy, phenyl, 4 pyridyl or 2 pyridyl group, and with the proviso that R₁ and R₂ cannot have simultaneously the same meaning of H, and therapeutically acceptable salts therof. Particularly preferable compounds can be seen in claims 2 5. The compounds I of the present invention may also be tautomers therof represented by the general formula II These compounds II are of course included within the scope of the present invention. As to this class of compounds it can bee seen from the prior art that The Journal of Organic Chemistry, vol. 33, No. 9, 12. Sept. 1968, pages 3648 5 has mentioned already the compound Forms of use generally or specifically as cardiacs are not reported. The isoquinoline derivates of the present invention may be prepared by, for example, the following processes In the reaction routes 1 to 4 illustrated above, R represents methyl group, X represents a halogen atom, and R represents methyl or phenyl group. In accordance with the reaction route 1 , mono ethers IV prepared from starting compounds III may be converted into V by the action of an oxidizing agent, such as pyridinium chlorochromate or manganese dioxide. Compounds V may then be acetylated to produce VI by using an appropriate acetylating agent, such as acetylimidazole, acetic anhydride, an acetyl halide, or an acetic acid ester, in the presence of a sodium alkoxide, sodium hydride, boron trifluoride acetate, lithium diisopropylamide, zinc chloride, or the like. Alternatively, V may be converted into enamines with cyclic amines such as pyrrolidine, and the enamines may then be acetylated by acetic anhydride to prepare VI . Thereafter, compounds VI and cyanoacetamide may be subjected to condensation reaction in an alcohol, such as methanol or ethanol, in the presence of either a secondary amine such as, for example, piperidine or diethylamine, or a sodium alkoxide to prepare VII . Then, VII may be reacted with a mineral acid such as sulfuric acid to produce compounds VIII , which are included within the compounds I according to the present invention. The compounds VIII may further be nitrated in a conventional manner to prepare compounds IX having nitro group at 4 position thereof, which are also included within the compounds I according to the present invention. In accordance with the reaction route 2 , compounds VII may be reacted with a methylmagnesium halide to prepare compounds X having acetyl group at 4 position thereof, which are also included within the compounds I according to the present invention. In accordance with the reaction route 3 , other starting compounds XI may be treated by methods analogous to those in the reaction routes 1 and 2 to produce compounds XIV , XV and XVI having hydrogen atom, nitro group and acetyl group, respectively, at 4 position thereof. These compounds XIV , XV and XVI are also included within the compounds I according to the present invention. In accordance with the reaction route 4 , still other starting compounds XVII may be condensed with 2 or 4 bromopyridine in the presence of n butyl lithium or the like to prepare XVIII , which may then be subjected to the action of, e.g., thionyl chloride in pyridine to produce XIX . Then, XIX may be reduced with hydrogen in a mineral acid to prepare XX , which may be treated by methods analogous to those in the reaction routes 1 and 2 to produce compounds XXIII , XXIV and XXV having hydrogen atom, nitro group and acetyl group, respectively, at 4 position thereof. The compounds XXIII , XXIV and XXV are also included within the compounds I according to the present invention. Further, compounds having a halogen atom at 4 position thereof, which are also included within the scope of the present invention, may be prepared by reacting, e.g., the compounds represented by the aforementioned formula VIII , XIV or XXIII with an appropriate halogenating agent such as bromine in a solvent such as acetic acid. When the compounds according to the present invention are employed as cardiotonic agents, they may be administered parenterally, for example intravenously, but preferably orally. The compounds according to the present invention may be prepared into any dosage form suitable for intended administration route. For example, the compounds and salts thereof can be used either as such or in combination with any pharmaceutically acceptable, innoxious adjuvant s , such as excipient, carrier, binder, stabilizer, diluent, and flavors. The dosage form of these agents may be tablet, capsule, granule, powder, syrup, or elixir when they are orally administered, or injectable preparations when administered parenterally. Dosage amounts to be administered to human beings may be determined by physicians by taking into consideration conditions and ages of patients to be treated and administration routes of the agents to them, etc. For example, the dosage amounts may be about 0.1 10 mg per kg of body weight a day for oral administration, but of course they are not limited to these. According to the present invention there are provided novel isoquinoline derivatives. The novel isoquinoline derivatives of the present invention have been found to be useful for cardiotonic agents and have low toxicity and wide safety margin.
