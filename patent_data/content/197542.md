# SELECTIVE CALL APPARATUS HAVING DISPLAY

## Abstract
A selection call signal transmitted from a transmitter is received and compared with a preset selective call signal. When the compared signals coincide with each other, an alert tone is produced and a received message signal is displayed on a display device. An error detection circuit is provided for detecting an error of the message signal to produce an error signal. According to the presence or absence of the error signal the message signal is converted into display signals of opposite signs so as to display messages containing and not containing the error with opposite contrasts.
