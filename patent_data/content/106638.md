## Description
METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR GROWING TERIAL IN A GLOW DISCHARGEThe invention relates to a method and apparatus for growing material in a glow discharge and to a material produced thereby.Glow discharge growth techniques are known. Por example a plasma is caused in a hydrocarbon gas inside an evacuated chamber Carbon ions strike the cathode and adhere to form a carbon coating. For correct growth conditions the coating i8 extremely hard and aubstantially transparent to infra red radiation. Unfortunately internal atresses prevent growth of layers thicker than about 3 r under these conditions. Interstitial carbon atoms in the layer absorb radiation at shorter wavelengths of the spectrum particularly in the visible regions and hydrogen in the films produce selective absorption. Coating of silicon using the gas silane and coatings of germanium using germane may also be grown in a glow discharge.Sputtering is also a known technique. Argon ions inside a glow discharge chamber strike a target arranged as a cathode containing coating material. Atoms or atomic clusters are dislodged from the target and stick on a substrate arranged suitably near the target. Glow discharge techniques are described in Thin Film Solids 58 1979 101 105, 106, 107 116, 117 120 Spear W. E., Doped Amorphous Semiconductor, Advances in Physics 1977, Vol 26, No. 6, 811 845 Patent Specifications G.B. 2,047,877 A, 2,067,304 A 2,069,008 A 2,082,562 A 2,083,841 A.Patent Specification No. G.B. 2,069,009 A describes a growth technique in which a substrate is arranged above an aluminium cathode. Carbon ions strike the cathode, some adhere to the cathode and some bounce off and stick onto the substrate. A bias voltage may be applied to the substrate. This layer has a lower strain than similar layers deposited on cathodes but it still contains interstitial carbon.According to this invention a method of growing a combined layer of at least a first and a second material comprisng the steps of arranging a first material forming a target material on a cathode in a glow discharge chamber, arranging a substate to be coated on a holder a spaced distance from the target, maintaining the substrate temperature at a required level, admitting elements of the second material and a sputtering material into the chamber, and establishing a glow discharge within the chamber, the glow discharge plasma containing ions of the second material for adhering to the target material and ions of the sputtering material that sputter off both the first material and second material onto the substrate, the arrangement being such that as molecules of the second material are deposited on the target molecules of both the first and second material are sputtered off to deposit on the substrate where a layer of the first and second material gradually builds up in thickness to the required value. The sputtering ions may be argon ions.The target material may be a single material or a mixture of materials such as silicon, germanium, tungsten or any other material capable of being sputtered and forming a compound or mixture with the second materialThe second material may be carbon inroduced as a hydrocarbon gas such as butane methane propane etc.The substrate temperature may be at an elevated temperature e.g. above 300at typically 53000 when using a hydrocarbon gas to prevent deposition of hydrogen on the substrate.Additionally a third or further materials may be introduced into the chamber as a gas to grow a layer of at least three element8. In some cases an additional source of the first material may be introduced as a gas. For example when using a Ge target the gas germane may be bled into the chamber. This assists deposition of GexCl x onto the substrate. For a Si target silane is introduced.After growth of the required layer the substrate may be removed or the layer left as a coating on the substrate.The material grown may be SixCl x GexCl x WxCl x O x 1 or any other suitable carbide or mixtures or carbides. The value of x may be changed across the thickness to the layer to provide a graded layer. According to this invention apparatus for growing a layer of at least a first and a second material comprises a vacuum tight chamber, an anode, and a cathode structure including target material in the chamber, means for establishing a glow discharge in the chamber, a vacuum pump for evacuating the chamber, means for supplying gases into the chamber, and a substrate holder for supporting the substrate a spaced distance from the cathode, the arrangement being such that ion of one of the gases deposit on the cathode and both these and the target material are sputtered off to land on the substrate and build up as a layer of the required material.When growing layers containing carbon using a hydrocarbon gas the substrate holder includes means for heating the substrate. This heating may be an electrical resistive heater or a susceptor and external R.F. coils. Typical substrate temperature is above 500 C. e.g. 53O0C. The glow discharge may be energised by D.C.or A.C. or any suitable frequency power to the cathode, or by ext√ßrnally mounted R.F. coils.The invention will now be described by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawings of which Figure 1 is a sectional view of glow discharge apparatus for growing a layer on a substrate Figure 2 is a sectional view of a substrate coated by the apparatus of Figure 1. The apparatus of Figure 1 comprises a pressure tight chamber 1 formed by an annular wall 2 closed by earthed top and bottom plates 3, 4 respectively. The plates 3, 4 form anodes. A vacuum pump 5 is connected by a pipe 6 and valve 7 to evacuate the chamber 1 and maintain a desired vacuum during growth. Supplies of gases e.g. argon and a hydrocarbon gas such as butane, or gases such as silane, or germane are bled into the chamber 1 via valves 8, 9, 10 and pipes 11, 12, 13. A cathode structure 14 is mounted in the chamber 1 and electrically isolated from the bottom plate 4 by a sleeve 15. Electrical power is supplied to the cathode 14 by a power source 16. For an A.C. supply this is through a capacitor 17, a D.C. supply needs no capacitor. A piece of material 18 such as silicon, germanium, etc. is looated on the upper surface of the cathode structure 14 to form the target. Above the target 18 a substrate 19 is held by a holder 20 electrically isolated from the top plate 3 by a sleeve 21. Inside the holder 20 is an electrical resistance heater 22 supplied with power from a heater control power supply 23. The substrate 19 forms a support on which a layer 24 of the required material is grown. It may be regular, flat.or curved, or irregular. To ensure even coating of a substrate 19 it may be rotated with or by the holder 20. Operation to grow SixO1x is ds follows. A target material 18 of silicon is mounted on the cathode 14 to form the cathide in a glow discharge. A thin substrate 19 of aluminium is fixed to the holder 20. The chamber 1 is evacuated to about 10 5 Torr.to remove contaminants. Argon and butane gas is bled into the chamber through the valves 8, 9, 10, and the pump 5 operated to maintain a pressure of about 0.7 to 1 x 10 Torr. on an air calibrated gauge. The substrate 19 is heated to about 550 C. and maintained at this temperature during growth of the layer 24.R.F. power of typically 1 Kvolt, 13 NHz. and 200 watts power is supplied to the cathode 14, 18. This ionises the gas mixture.Positively changed carbon ions are attracted to and stick to the target 18 acting as a cathode. Without the presence of argon ions this world result in growth of a carbon layer on the target 18.The possitively charged argon ions sputter both these newly deposited carbon molecules and silicon molecules from the target 18. Sputtered molecules of carbon and silicon land and adhere to the substrate 19 gradually building up a layer 24 ofSi C x The value of x is adjustable by adjusting the argon butane ratio inputs. when the required thickness has grown the glow discharge is stopped and the substrate allowed to cool.For a D.C. generated plasma the supply is typically at 2 k.volts.An electrical bias may be applied to the substrate during growth of the layer 24. If a self supporting layer of SiC is required the aluminium substrate is etched away leaving a SixC1 xlayer. Providing growth conditions were correct the Si C 1 x layer is transparent x to radiation in the 3 5 r waveband.A layer of SiC may be required as a thin e.g. 1 m coating on ZnS or ZnSe lenses. Being hard SiC forms an excellent abrasion resistant protective layer that is transparent at 3 5 rn wavelengths. For coating surfaces the substrate may be temporarily connected as a cathode and argon gas only admitted to the chamber. A glow discharge is formed and the substrate cleaned. After a suitable time of cleaning the glow discharge is stopped and the above process is started. Coatings of e.g. 1 tm thick Ge C on Ge, ZnS, or ZnSe may x 1 x be made as above using a target material of Ge. Similarly self supporting layers of GeC may be grown on aluminium substrates which are subsequently etched away. Providing the correct growth conditions are observed the Ge C is optically transparent in the 3 5 and 10 14 m wavelength band. It is hard and may be used alone or as a protective coating. As before the value of x in the grown layer is controlled by controlling the proportion of Ar and butane gasses. Again the value of x may vary. For example when coating germanium lenses the value of x may initially be close to 1 and then gradually changed towards zero. This may assist bonding. Then growing layers of more than two materials one material may be introduced from an ion beam source or molecular beam source.
