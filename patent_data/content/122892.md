# Method of producing a guide vane ring for a return flow passage in axial fans.

## Abstract
A guide vane ring for a return flow passage in axial fans comprises a ring 3 intended for placing in the return flow passage 4 coaxial with the impeller 6 . A plurality of guide vanes 7 are formed integral with the ring and distributed round its exterior circumference. In a method of producing such a ring integral with its vanes, separate longitudinal slits are formed in a line one after the other in a metal strip. A cut is made transverse the strip between one end of each slit and one long edge of the strip. Portions of the band thus cut free are bent out from its plane and formed to a desired configura tion, whereafter the formed band portions are bent such that the transverse cut lines will extend substantially at right angles to the unformed flat band portion. This flat band por tion is cut to desired length, formed and joined together into a circular ring with the portions formed to desired configuration forming exterior, substantially axially disposed guide vanes.
