# ELECTRONIC BALANCE.

## Abstract
An electronic balance having highly improved accuracy of the measurement obtained by reducing the errors due to the scatter of data, which is an inevitable problem of the prior art in which the measurements have been made by calculating the simple average value of the sampled data during a predeter mined period of time to avoid the interfering influences due to vibrations of the object being measured as such or caused by installing locations or windiness. In the electronic balance of this invention, the values of data sampled during a predeter mined period of time are stored and at the same time the latest sampled values is compared in order with the previously stored values. When the value of difference obtained by the comparison is within a predetermined acceptable allowance, calculations are made for all the stored values to derive an av erage value. If the difference is beyond the allowance, the stored data are erased and the operations of sampling and comparison are repeated until the scatter of all the sampled values may come within the limit allowed. Since the electronic balance of this invention is capable of measurement with high accuracy even under the vibrative cirumstances, it may be ef fectively used for body weight measurement of laboratory ani mals or various kinds of control system in factories, and further is applicable to measurement systems which are equipped on moving carrier means such as cars, ships and the like.
