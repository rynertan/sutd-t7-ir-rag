# Compression rate analyzer.

## Abstract
A system and method for monitoring the performance and condition of various cylinder components of internal combustion engines through the provision of a transducer for detecting the time rate of change of pressure within the cylinder during normal operation of the engine and a circuit for processing and quantizing the transducer signal to develop a numerical indication of pressure changes within the cylinders. The system also includes a tachometer circuit and display means as well as an optional memory and processor to facilitate a comparative analysis of the various cylinders at varying speeds.
