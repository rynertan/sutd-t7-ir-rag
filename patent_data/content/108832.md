## Description
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a frame for a folding bicycle and more particularly to the arrangement of frame components for allowing the bicycle to be instantaneously unfolded or folded as well as the frame weight to be made as light as possible in order to facilitate carrying of the bicycle being folded. Folding bicycle frames have mechanisms for fold. Conventional folding bicycle frames, howeverr have such problems that operation for unfolding, particularly folding, is troublsom and the frame weight increases as well. it is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a bicycle frame structure including as a base a base frame with a frame structure which is triangular when viewed sideways and a quadric limited link frame assembled thereon and adapted to be unfoldable or foldable in order to facilitate the folding operation and moreover employing mainly pipe material in order to decrease the frame weight, wherein frames are disposed so that buckling is prevented as much as possible and particularly tension is applied to a long frame, which is large in weight, thereby to reduce the frame weight without damaging the strength. A preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described hereinunder with reference to the accompanying drawings. A hanger pipe 2 and a pair of hanger brackets 3 are provided at the lower end of a main pipe l, while a front bracket 6 is provided at the upper end.Here, the upper ends of the hanger brackets 3 and a rear end member 8 are connected with a back fork 9 and moreover, the front bracket 6 and the rear end member 8 are connected with a pair of lower stays 10, thereby to form a base frame which is triangular when viewed sideways. With the main pipe 1 defining one side of the triangle as a base, a shaft 5 is provided through the hanger brackets 3 provided at the upper end of the main pipe l, and the lower end of a seat pipe l1 is rotatably connected to the shaft 5.The upper end of the seat pipe ll has a seat post fastening part 12 for mounting a saddle, and an upper bracket 13 is provided near the upper end of the seat pipe II In addition, a shaft 7 is also provided through the front bracket 6 at the lower end of the main pipe 1, and the lower end of the front pipe 15 is rotatably connected to the shaft 7. A head pipe 16 to hold a handle bar post and a front fork is secured to the upper end of the front pipe 15, and a head bracket 17 for scattering the stress applied to the securing part is provided extending over the head pipe 16 and the upper end of the front pipe 15.Shafts 14, 18 provided through the upper bracket 13 and the head bracket 17 respectively are connected with an upper stay 20 to form a quadric limited link frame capable of being folded at four joints between the main pipe 1, the seat pipe 11, the upper stay 20 and the front pipe 15 respectively. In addition, a link adapted to be bendable and stretchable is engaged between proper components of the quadric limited link frame so that it can be unfolded or folded. In the present invention, the link is diagonally disposed between the head bracket 17 and the hanger brackets 3 in the members constituting the quadric limited link frame, and the link is adapted to be bendable and stretchable in order to facilitate unfolding and folding of the quadric limited link frame. Consequently, a shaft 19 is provided through the head bracket 17, and one end of a link 21 is pivotably attached to the shaft 19. The link A21 has a stepped part 22 with a diameter a size larger than that of the main body. A shaft 4 is also provided through the hanger brackets 3, and one end of a link B23 is pivotably attached to the shaft 4. Here, a folding shaft 24 is provided through the other ends of the respective links A21 and B23 so that the links A21 and B23 are stretchable with the shaft 24 as a pivoting center.A support collar 25 extending over both the links A21 and B23 is slidably disposed, and a compression spring 26 is loaded on the side of the link B23 so as to constantly press the support collar 25 toward the stepped part 22 of the link A21. In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the shafts 18, 19 are separately provided to the head bracket 17. However, these shafts may be the same. On the other hand, the positions of the shafts 4, 19 are selected so that the line of action of the compression force at the position of the shaft 4 and that at the position of the shaft 19 face to each other on the same line, thereby to allow only the force in the axial direction of the link to be applied to the folding shaft 24 of the link as much as possible. By covering the outside of the compression spring 26 with a coating material, durability is improved and also safety is ensured. Another preferred embodiment is such that, as shown in Figs. 7 and 8, in order to allow the slide of the support collar 25 to be remotely controlled, one end of a cord 27 is connected to a portion of the support collar 25. The cord 27 is once passed below the axial central line of the link, then passed under the position of the shaft 4 of the hanger brackets 3 and inserted through a receiving bore 29 provided in the upper end part of the seat pipe 11, e.g., in the upper bracket 13, and a tag 28 is connected to the open end of the cord 27. Since the present invention has such arrangement as described above, the quadric limited link frame is unfolded or folded with the triangular base frame as a base. In the quadric limited link frame, the support collar .25 is disposed on the links A21 and B23 in the link diagonally inserted between the hanger brackets 3 and the head bracket 17, and the support collar 25 is resiliently brought into contact with the stepped part 22 of the link A21 by means of the compression spring 26 at all times and moreover the support collar 25 covers the periphery of the joint between the links A21 and B23 including the folding shaft 24. Therefore, the links A21 andB23 cannot bend and consequently form a beam to secure the quadric limited link frame in an unfolded state. Removing the securing for the unfolded state of the quadric limited link frame permits the frame to be folded in such a direction that the seat pipe 11 is rearward inclined as shown in Fig. 2. Accordingly, when the support collar 25 is slid toward the side of the shaft 4 against the compression spring 26 so that the joint between the links A21 and B23 is exposed and moreover a force for moving the folding shaft 24 toward the shaft 7 is applied in order to remove the securing for the unfolded state of the quadric limited link frame, the links A21 and B23 are folded in two as shown in Fig. 2 and also the quadric link is forcedly brought into a folded state. In case of remote controlling the slide of the support collar 25 according to the second mentioned preferred embodiment, since the cord 27 is once passed below the axial central line of the link, the force applied to the support collar 25 when the cord 27 is pulled acts not only in the direction of making the support collar 25 slide toward the shaft 4 against the compression spring 26 but also in the direction of making the link move downward although it is a slight extent.Accordingly, the links A21 and B23 can be folded in two simply by pulling the tag 28 attached to the cord 27, and the frame is folded therewith. Accordingly, the present invention can be folded extremely simply by sliding the support collar 25 and pressing the link and the like so that the folding shaft 24 moves downward.Moreover, since the present invention is constituted so that a tensile load is mainly applied to a long member such as the lower stays 10 and the upper stay 20 in order to prevent buckling, it is possible to reduce the sectional area of such member correspondingly and decrease the weight of the frame. As the result of the second mentioned preferred embodiment, since the receiving bore 29 for the cord 27 is provided in the upper bracket 13 in the upper part of the seat pipe 11, it is unnecessary to slide the support collar 25 directly with the hand. Therefore, there is no possiblity that the finger is nipped between the components, and it also becomes possible to fold the bicycle by pulling the tag 28 in a getting off posture from the bicycle. As will be fully understood from the foregoing description, according to the present invention, it is possible to provide a frame for a folding bicycle capable of being simply unfolded and folded as well as reducing the frame weight without damaging the strength.BRIEF DESCRIPTIO OF THE DRAWINGS Fig. 1 is an elevational view of a frame for a folding bicycle according to the present invention Fig. 2 is an elevational view of the frame in a folded state Fig. 3 is a partly sectioned elevational view of a link Fig. 4 is a partly sectioned elevational view of the links Fig. 5 is a sectional view taken along the line A A of the Fig. 3 Fig. 6 is a partly sectioned side elevational view of the link being folded in two Fig. 7 is an elevational view of another preferred embodiment and Fig. 8 is an elevational view of the second mentioned preferred embodiment in a folded state.
