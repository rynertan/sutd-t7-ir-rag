# Automatic receiver gain control in centralized monitor system.

## Abstract
Disclosed is an extremely useful centralized monitor system which can be automatically controlled so that the signal receiving levels in each component of the system can be constantly held at an optimum position even in the presence of noise components, since they are totally free from any failure caused by the noise interference. More particularly, the monitor panel as part of the centralized monitor system collects and displays any alarm information detected by any of the sub units constituting part of the system while using the indoor power line as the data transmission path, enabling the centralized monitor system to generate an alarm upon receipt of such alarm information from the monitor panel, while the automatic receiver gain controller 5, 6, 7 , in responding to an answer back instruction periodically output by the monitor panel, proper ly controls both the monitor panel and sub units so that both will remain in such positions where their incoming signal levels can be held optimum even under presence of a variety of noise components.
