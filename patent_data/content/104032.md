# MAGNETIC TACHOMETER ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
A tachometer assembly comprises two toothed rings 68, 70 in approximate axial register. The rings have similar peripheries of which the teeth 69, 71 are closely spaced in the axial direction of the rings. Magnetic flux in a path extending axially of the teeth varies as the rings rotate and is sensed by a coil 74 disposed coaxially of the rings.
