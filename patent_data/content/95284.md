# Tantalum bonding method.

## Abstract
A method of joining tantalum to a non refractory material includes the steps of bonding a tantalum layer 18 to a Kovar substrate 28 by brazing in an inert atmosphere whereby Incusil as an intermediate braze material 30 is elevated to its liquidus temperature followed by a slow cooling of approximately 38 C hrm to below its solidus temperature to minimize distortion of the bond therebe tween. Layer 18 may be the diaphragm of a pressure transducerm the diaphragm being contained between cover 14 and housing 16.

## Description
TANTALUM BONDING METHOD The present invention relates to tantalum bonding techniques. More specifically, the present invention is directed to a method for bonding tantalum to non refractory materials, particularly applicable for use in the construction of pressure transducers. The use of barrier diaphragms to separate a sensing element in pressure transducers from an input fluid has necessitated the use of materials which are substantially impervious to process fluids. One such material which has found recent acceptance in such isolation diaphragms is tantalum Ta . While tantalum has been bonded to itself and other refractory materials the bonding of tantalum to nonrefractory materials involves a significant problem created by the very high melting point of tantalum, the low coefficient of thermal expansion of tantalum and the tenacious surface oxide found on tantalum. Accordingly, the welding of tantalum to material such as stainless steel Hastaloy C and Monel 400 has not been capable, using prior art techniques,of yielding sound high strength metallurgical bonds.Most of these substrate materials simply vaporize as the melting point of tantalum 5435 F is achieved in welding.Furthermore, the alloys formed between these materials during welding are often brittle intrametallic compounds. The brazing of tantalum to more conventional engineering materials, e.g., stainless steel, has been hampered by tantalum s extremely low coefficient of thermal expansion, and the inability of braze alloys to break through tantalum s tenacious oxide. It is an aim of the present invention to provide a method of bonding tantalum to non refractory materials. According to the present invention, there is provided a method of bonding a tantalum layer to a non refractory substrate characterized by the steps of providing, between overlapping areas of the tantalum layer and the substrate an intermediate layer capable of bonding said tantalum layer to said non refractory layer subjecting the composite structure to a temperature above the liquids temperature of the intermediate layer in an inert atmosphere and gradually reducing the temperature of the composite structure to below the solidus temperature of the intermediate layer. An embodiment of the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a cross section of a prior art structure of a tantalum diaphragm bonded to a tantalum substrate, Figure 2 is a cross section of a tantalum diaphragm bonded to a non refractory substrate in accordance with a method of the present invention, and Figure 3 is a cross section of a pressure transducer using the material bond shown in Figure 2. Referring to Figure 1, a tantalum substrate 2 is attached to a tantalum diaphragm 4 by an electron beam weld 6 arranged at the junction between the diaphragm 4 and the substrate 2. Such a prior art structure is inherently expensive as a result of the need for a tantalum support substrate 2. The substrate 2 may be subsequently attached to a transducer apparatus utilizing the diaphragm 4 by conventional fluid seal elements such as an O ring seal. Referring to Figure 2, a tantalum element 10, such as a diaphragm, is bonded to a non tantalum and non refractory substrate 8, by intermediate braze alloy 12. The substrate 8 is a metallic material having a coefficient of thermal expansion similar to that of tantalum and is a material which is capable of being welded to a support structure which may be of typical materials used in pressure transducer housings, e.g., stainless steel. The substrate 8 may be a nickel, cobalt and iron alloy known as Kovar made byCartech Inc., of Reading, Pennsylvania. The braze alloy 12 must have the capability of wetting tantalum to penetrate surface oxide thus promoting a strong metallurgical bond and lowest melting point possible to minimize stress and distortion resulting from the remaining thermal coefficient mismatch between tantalum and Kovar.One such material isIncusil 15, a silver, copper, and indium alloy made by theWesco Division of GTE Sylvania, Belmont, California. The braze layer 12 has a thickness of .025 to .125 mm. The brazing cycle for attaching the tantalum to theKovar substrate 8 is performed in an inert atmosphere, e.g., argon. The layered combination of the substrate 8, the tantalum 10 and the braze alloy 12 is initially heated to achieve the liquidus temperature of the braze alloy 12. Specifically, the liquidus range starts at 704 C while the solidus range starts at 627 C . A subsequent slow cooling 0 of the layered structure of approximately 38 C per hour from the aforesaid liquids to the solidus temperature produces the bond between the tantalum 10 and the Kovar substrate 8. The bonded tantalum and Kovar is retained in use below the solidus temperature of the braze alloy 12.The slow cooling allows the remaining differential expansion between the tantalum 10 and the Kovar substrate 8 to be accommodated and to prevent buckling or wrinkling of the tantalum 10 to produce a flat surface bond with the Kovar substrate 8. This bond provides a successful attachment of the tantalum 10 to the Kovar substrate 8. In Figure 3, a transducer apparatus utilizing the bonding technique discussed above with respect to Figure 2, includes a cover 14 and a transducer housing 16 of any suitable material, e.g., stainless steel. A tantalum diaphragm 18 is arranged to divide a space 20 within the cover 14 from a space 22 within the housing 16. A fluid inlet connection 24 is provided in the cover 14 to allow the connection of a fluid inlet line not shown . A port 26 is arranged to admit the fluid from the inlet line to the space 20 within the cover 14. The Kovar substrate is in the form of a ring 28 which is attached to the tantalum diaphragm 18 by the braze alloy 30 using the aforesaid bonding technique. The peripheral surface of the tantalum diaphragm 18 is provided with a fluid tight seal to the cover 14 by an O ring 32 retained in a recess within the cover 14. The cover 14 is attached to the housing 16 by any suitable means, e.g., bolts. The Kovar ring 28 is attached to the housing 16 by an electron beam weld 32 extending around the periphery of the housing 16. A port 34 is provided within the housing 16 to connect the space 22 to fluid pressure sensing elements which may be conventional strain sensitive elements not shown . A substantially incompressible fill fluid would be used to fill the space 22 and the port 34 to transmit a fluid pressure from the diaphragm 18 to the strain sensitive elements to provide an output signal representative of the fluid pressure applied to the transducer apparatus from the fluid inlet port 26.
