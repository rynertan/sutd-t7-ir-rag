# DC WELDING POWER SUPPLY SYSTEM

## Abstract
A welding DC power supply system suitable for consum able or non consumable electrode welding, comprising a plural number of inverter units 10 adapted to convert a first direct current into an alternate current and to rectify the alternate current to produce an output of a second direct current a circuit connecting the output of terminals of the inverter units in parallel a detection circuit 25 for detecting the total output current of the inverter units and a circuit for varying the number of operating inverter units according to the value of the detected total output current. According to other aspects of the invention, the power supply system is further provided with a phase control means 120 for controlling the phases of alternate currents produced by the respective inverter units 10 , or means for selectively actuating a particular inverter unit 10A, 10B or units in a short circuit period of large current in dip transfer welding, or feedback means for suppressing the current in a controlled timing in the final stage of each short circuit period to prevent spattering as caused by bursting rupture of the large short circuit current.
