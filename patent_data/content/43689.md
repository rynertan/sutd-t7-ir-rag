# BEAM WAVEGUIDE FEED FOR ANTENNA

## Abstract
In microwave communication systems it is common prac tice to use a beam waveguide to transmit energy between a waveguide 2 connected to transmitting and receiving equip ment located at ground level and a main antenna reflector mounted above ground level. Hitherto the waveguide 2 has terminated in a very large, accurately ma chined, horn which is necessary to produce a beam having a small angle of divergence suitable for entry into the beam waveguide 6 . The present invention proposes that this large and very expensive horn be replaced by a relatively small horn 18 which produces a beam having a relatively wide angle of diver gence. By using a concave reflector 22 and a sub reflector 21 in Cassegrain configuration this widely diverging beam is converted into a more nearly parallel or a totally parallel beam which enters the beam waveguide 6 as illustrated.
