# IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO ALCOHOL DETECTION DEVICES

## Abstract
An alcohol detection device for controlling the ignition circuit of a vehicle. The device incorporates an alcohol sensor 10 within an open ended body 21 to enhance evaporation of condensation within the body 21 . Also mounted in the body 21 is a breath pressure operative switch 25 to operate in conjunction with the sensor 10 . The outputs from the sensor 10 and the switch 25 are fed to an electronic circuit latching means 19 controlling a short provided on a vehicle s ignition circuit. An intending driver exhales into the body 21 a sufficient amount to activate the pressure switch 25 and in so doing provide a breath sample for the sensor 10 . A time delay circuit 16 is preferably provided whereby the pressure switch 25 must be closed for a time period commensurate to that of the timer 16 to provide an output signal to the latching means 19 .
