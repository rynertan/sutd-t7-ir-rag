# Apparatus for testing stability of heavy oil.

## Abstract
Electric heating means is arranged in the bottom portion of one case body, and an air bath tank and a sample heating tank, communicating with each other, are formed within this case body. The temperature of air in the air bath tank is maintained at a predetermined level by a temperature detecting element and a temperature controlling device. A filter paper is held in the air bath tank by supporting means at a position above the heating means spacedly by a predetermined distance from the heating means. A heavy oil sample heated at a predetermined temperature for a predetermined time in the sample heating tank is dropped on the filter paper and the filter paper is dried for a predetermined time. The stability of the heavy oil is evaluated based on the state of spreading of the dropped heavy oil on the filter paper.
