## Description
MANUFACTURE OF URETHANES FROM TERTIARY ARALKYL DIOLS This invention relates to the manufacture of isocyanates and in particular provides a new route for the synthesis of tertiary aralkyl urethanes which are prepared from the corresponding tertiary hydroxy aralkyl compounds and from which the corresponding tertiary aralkyl isocyanates can be prepared. A new synthesis of tertiary aralkyl isocyanates from the corresponding olefins is described in copending application Serial No. 400,799 , filedJuly 22 , 1982. In accordance with that application the manufacture of a tertiary aralkyl isocyanate is by the preparation of the corresponding tertiary aralkyl carbamic acid ester of a lower. aliphatic alcohol followed by the thermal cracking of such urethane to form the isocyanate and the free alcohol. It is an important object of this invention to provide an alternate route to the manufacture of tertiary aralkyl isocyanates through the same carbamic acid esters using tertiary hydroxy compounds as precursors.Thus in accordance with this invention, tertiary aralkyl diols are reacted with lower alkyl esters of carbamic acid to form the N substituted tertiary aralkyl carbamic acid esters, which, as in the above noted copending application, can then be thermally cracked to give the corresponding isocyanates. Since the esters of carbamic acid, such as methyl carbamate, the esters of N substituted carbamic acids, such as the di methyl ester of a, a, a, a, tetramethylxylylene dicarbamic acid, and the polymers of poly isocyanates with polyols are all properly called urethanes, for the sake of clarity, herein an unsubstituted carbamic acid ester will be called carbamate or carbamic acid ester a substituted carbamic acid ester will be called urethane , monourethane t, diurethane , polyurethane or urethane ester and the polymers will be called urethane polymers . Urethanes which are useful in forming tertiary aralkyl isocyanrtes by thermal cracking in accordance with this invention are those described in the above noted copending application and are generally designated by the formula EMI2.1 wherein R is an alkyl radical having from 1 to 18 or more carbon atoms R1 is an alkyl radical having from 1 to 3 carbon atoms and R2 represents an aromatic hydrocarbon moiety such as phenyl, biphenyl and naphthalyl and such an aromatic hydrocarbon moiety having substituents including halogen atoms, methyl and methoxy groups and substituents such as EMI2.2 These urethanes are thus tertiary aralkyl urethanes in which R is a radical derived from an aliphatic alcohol, such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, 2 ethyl hexanol l and n octadecanol.Such alcohol is split off on thermal cracking of the urethane ester and can usually be recovered and recycled. These tertiary aralkyl urethane esters in accordance with this invention are prepared by reaction of the carbamic acid ester of an alkyl or aralkyl alcohol and a tertiary aralkyl diol. The reaction of the diol and carbamate generally proceeds at moderate temperatures in the presence of an acid catalyst such as sulfuric acid, toluene sulfonic acid, dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid, hydrocarbon sulfate esters, hydrogen chloride, boron trifluoride, and other Lewis andBronstead acids. The reaction takes place in the presence of solvents such as toluene, xylene, chlorobenzene and methylene dichloride, but also can take place in the absence of solvents. Generally, an excess of carbamate is preferred, but selective conversion of diol to mono urethane can take place, if the amount carbamate is limited, yielding a urethane ester having a mono hydroxy or a mono olefin functionality.Heat can be used to accelerate the reaction. Temperatures which are suitable range from about room temperature to about 1500C. After formation of the urethane ester the reaction mixture is neutralized with base, such asCaO, Na2CO3, NaOH and the like, and thermally cracked to yield the isocyanate as described in the above noted copending application. The water formed by reaction of the diol and the carbamate or otherwise present in the system can be removed, following neutralization, by distillation prior to cracking.If excess of carbamate was employed this is preferably also distilled off at partial vacuum and recovered.Generally, water will be removed first in such distillation. The recovered carbamate can be recycled with water present, as water is formed in the system in any event. The reaction mixture of urethanes, unreacted carbamate ester, catalyst, water and byproducts can also be separated by dnosdng in water, for example, in sodium carbamate solution to separate the urethane products as insolubles and also to neutralize the catalyst. As in the above noted copending application, the urethane esters are then converted to the corresponding tertiary aralkyl isocyanates by thermal cracking. Yields are good, and alcohol recovery and removal are particularly high where the aliphatic alcohol group of the initial carbamic acid ester is methanol or other lower, preferably normal, alcohol. Suitable diol precursors include para and meta a,a,a a tetramethyl xylylene diols, di l hydroxy i methyl ethyl naphthalenes, and other compounds having the general formula EMI4.1 in which R1 is an alkyl radical having from 1 to 3 carbon atoms, and R2 represents an aromatic hydrocarbon moiety selected from phenyl, biphenyl and naphthalyl groups and such groups having halo, methyl and methoxy substituents and substituents of the formula EMI4.2 wherein R1 has the same significance. Generally, while the proportion of carbamic acid ester to diol can be stoichiometric, preferably the carbamate is in substantial excess and functions as solvent and catalyst moderator as well as reactant.It is preferred in accordance with this invention to use from 50 to 8008 stoichiometric excess of carbamate, preferably about 300 excess carbamate. The amount of catalyst required to promote the addition of tertiary aralkyl diol and carbamic acid ester is not critical and can be varied widely.Where substantial excess of carbamic acid ester is utilized the amount of catalyst, based on the diol is typically 0.01 to 10 mole and preferably about 2 to 5 mole . Preferably the carbamate is heated mildly to maintain it molten, from 40 to 150 C. being preferred. The catalyst is dissolved in the molten carbamate, and the diol is then slowly added. When the reaction is complete the mixture is treated to remove or neutralize the catalyst. Unreacted carbamate ester is then separated by distillation in partial vacuum or by drawing in water and filtration to separate insoluble urethane products from water soluble carbamate ester. Tertiary aralkyl urethane esters form the corresponding isocyanate by thermal cracking while splitting off the alkanol. In many cases the alcohol can usefully be recycled by reaction with urea or isocyanic acid HNCO to form the starting carbamate ester. In cracking the urethane esters to form the corresponding isocyanates the catalyst must be removed or neutralized for example, with calcium oxide, sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide and the like, which is followed by cracking of the urethane ester either neat or in high boiling solvents, such as hexadecane, diphenyl ether, diisopropyl naphthalene and the like. Cracking takes place at temperatures on the order of 1500 to 3500C. splitting off the alkanol to yield the corresponding isocyanate. This invention has particular application in the production of tertiary aralkyl polyisocyanates from tertiary polyols and carbamic acid esters by addition of the reactants to form the corresponding polyurethane esters followed by thermal cracking of the polyurethane esters to the corresponding polyisocyanates. The preparation of m and p tetramethyl xylylene diisocyanates is outlined as follows EMI6.1 TMXDO TMXDU TMXDI The addition reaction can also be utilized to favor the production of a monourethane, such as isopropenyl a, a dimethylbenzyl urethane TMU , which can be thermally cracked to the corresponding olefinic monoisocyanate, such as isopropenyl a,a dimethylbenzyl isocyanate TMI .The reaction is as follows EMI7.1 m or p m or p ROH m or p TMI TMXDO TMU The following Examples illustrate the preparation of urethane esters in accordance with this invention and the utilization of such esters in the preparation of isocyanates useful in preparation of polyurethanes.
