# HYDROCARBON CONVERSION CATALYSTS

## Abstract
Hydrocarbon conversion catalysts are prepared from syn thetic faujasite Type Y zeolites which have an initial as syn thesized silica to alumina ratio in excess of 5.6 and preferably above 5.8. The catalysts are highly active for the catalytic cracking of hydrocarbons and are particularly resistant to deactivation by high temperature steam in the presence of me tals such as nickel and vanadium.
