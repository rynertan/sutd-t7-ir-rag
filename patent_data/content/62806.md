# Molding composition, method for preparing same and its use for semi conductor encapsulation.

## Abstract
A composition, suitable for encapsulation type molding, containing from about 30 to about 50 weight percent poly arylene sulfide , about 10 to about 30 weight percent glass fibers, about 30 to about 60 weight percent of a component that can be glass beads or fused silica and about 0.5 to about 3 weight percent of organic sane. Preferably the composi tion also contains up to about 2 weight percent of a processing aid. A method for preparing a composition suitable for molding in which there is compounded a masterbatch of glass fiber and poly arylene sulfide , the masterbatch is reduced to particles, and the masterbatch particles are blended with a sufficient amount of organic silane, additional poly arylene sulfide and a component chosen from glass beads and fused silica to provide a composition of about 30 to about 50 weight percent poly arylene sulfide , about 10 to about 30 weight percent glass fibers, about 30 to about 60 weight percent glass beads, or fused silica and 0.5 to about 3 weight percent organic silane. An article of manufacture comprising a semiconductor chip encapsulated in a molded composition as described above.
