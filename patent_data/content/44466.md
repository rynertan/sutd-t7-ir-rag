# Centrifugal degasser.

## Abstract
A centrifugal drilling mud degasser 50 for use in degassing gas cut drilling mud. The degasser comprises a casing 52 having an inlet port 54 for receiving a gas cut drilling mud 72 and an outlet port 56 for discharging degassed drilling mud a rotatable shaft 58 disposed longitudinally within the casing 52 a plurality of accelerat ing paddles 66 disposed along the longitudinal axis of the rotatable shaft 58 and attached thereto for moving drilling mud in a rotary motion to create a centrifugal force field and thereby create a vortex within such drilling mud such that drilling mud will move axially towards the outlet port 56 , such that the heavier liquid solid phase of the mud will be directed toward the inside wall 76 of the casing 52 , and such that gas dispersed within the mud will escape from the mud inwardly towards the shaft 58 to discharge from the casing 52 and means 60 operably associated with the rotatable shaft for driving the rotatable shaft 58 .
