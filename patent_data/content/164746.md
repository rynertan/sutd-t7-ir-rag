## Description
The present invention relates to an optical information recording and reproducing apparatus and an optical disc. In an information recording and reproducing apparatus for recording and reproducing information by sector, it is necessary to record information in each sector and reproduce it correctly from such sector. Further, the information recorded must be reproduced without fail. For this purpose, the conventional information recording and reproducing apparatuses confirm the sector address by an address part arranged ahead of the sectors or by counting a sector separation signal inserted between sectors to determine the sector address. Generally, however, a signal generating a sector address is so short in duration that an effective error control is impossible, necessitating a satisfactory guarantee of the reliability of the address part. As a corrective action, a system has been suggested Japanese Patent Application No. 62438 83 in which an address is recorded in a data recording part which is generally more reliable than the sector address part so that when the sector of the address indicated in the directory is to be reproduced at the time of reproduction, the address recorded in the data recording part is referred to thereby to prevent the loss of information. This system effectively prevents data from being lost by the unidentification of the sector address. When the address part is reproduced and compared with the sector address to be recorded in the recording process, however, an address obtained by reproducing an address part of a recorded sector may make up an address of an unrecorded sector by error, in which case data may undesirably be written again in the recorded sector. In such case, the data of the sector thus overwritten is destroyed. In view of this problem of data destruction caused by overwriting or double writing, means of preventing such an overwriting is necessary to improve the data reliability. With the increase in the recording capacity of the recording medium, on the other hand, a single recording medium tends to be jointly used by a multiplicity of users. Further, the complication of the method of system operation requires a write protecting means capable of defending each user from other users in case where data is lost by system an operation error depending on the degree of importance of data. Furthermore, if the address part is not reproduced always correctly for a flaw or a drop out of the recording medium, the address may not be reproduced correctly and may not be read correctly for the difference in environmental conditions or like at the time of reproduction, although the address may have been reproduced and data recorded correctly in data recording mode. For improving the data reading reliability, it is not proper to record data in such a sector, and it is necessary to avoid recording data in a sector from which the address cannot be always reproduced correctly. In EP A 124 770 which falls under Art. 54 3 , is proposed an information recording and reproducing apparatus comprising means for recording and reproducing a signal on and from a recording medium having an information recording region divided into a plurality of sectors, each having an address part recorded with an address signal and a data recording part to be recorded with data. For performing precise sector control and preventing data loss, a second address signal representing a sector in which the data is to be recorded is encoded for error compensation and recorded in a recording mode, and the second address signal reproduced with the data from the data recording section in a reproducing mode is used to discriminate an address of a sector for reproduction. The information recording and reproducing apparatus includes means for adding to the data the address of the sector where the data is to be recorded in the recording mode and means for decoding from the reproduced data the in data address in a reproducing mode. From PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY FOR OPTICAL ENGINEERING, Arlington, Virginia, 8th 9th June 1983, volume 421, pages 85 90, Bellingham, US R. IMANKA et al.

One object of the present invention is to provide an information recording and reproducing system in which an erroneous overwriting of a sector is prevented. One further object of the present invention is to provide an information recording and reproducing system in which sectors are eliminated whose address part cannot be read reliably. Another object of the present invention is to provide an information recording and reproducing system in which the loss of data is prevented by write protecting means defending one user from other users. According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided an information recording and reproducing apparatus comprising means for recording and reproducing a signal on and from a recording medium having an information recording region divided into a plurality of sectors each having an address part previously recorded with an address signal and a data recording part to be recorded with data, and means for overwriting a predetermined signal in the address part of a sector thereby to make the reproduction of the sector address of the address part impossible, wherein said recording reproducing means includes means for adding to data to be recorded an address of a sector where the data is to be recorded to produce an in data address and for encoding the data in recording mode, and means for detecting the in data address from reproduced data as a sector address wherefrom the data is to be reproduced in reproduction mode, and wherein a predetermined signal is overwritten by said overwriting means in the address part of the sector the recorded data of which is required to be protected. According to a second aspect of the invention there is provided an information recording apparatus comprising means for recording and reproducing a signal on and from a recording medium having an information recording region divided into a plurality of sectors each having an address part recorded with an address signal and a data recording part to be recorded with data means for overwriting a predetermined signal in the address part of a sector thereby to make the reproduction of the sector address of the address part impossible, and means for changing the binary level in detecting an address from a reproduced address signal, wherein the binary level after detection of an address at an optimum value of said binary level is changed by said level change means from said optimum value to a reduced value to detect the address from the reproduced address signal with a reduced reproduction sensitivity in recording mode again, and the address thus detected is compared with an address to be recorded so that when they fail to coincide with each other, the data is not recorded in said sector and a predetermined signal is overwritten in the address part thereby to make subsequent reproduction of the particular address part impossible. Finally, according to a third aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of formatting an optical disc comprising an information recording region divided into a plurality of sectors each including an address part recorded with an address signal and a data recording part to be recorded with data, wherein the binary level in reproducing the address from a reproduced address signal obtained by reproduction of the address part is changed after detection of an address at an optimum value of said binary level to a reduced value and the address reproduced with this reduced reproduction sensitivity is compared with the sector address of a relevant sector, so that when said addresses fail to coincide with each other, a predetermined signal is overwritten on the address part thereby to make subsequent reproduction of the particular address part impossible. The present invention will be apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Embodiments of the present invention will be described below with reference to the attached drawings. Fig. 1 is a diagram showing an example of a recording format of an optical disc used with an optical disc file device according to a first embodiment of the present invention. In Fig. 1, reference numeral 1 designates an address part, numeral 2 an address mark, numeral 3 an address data portion, numeral 4 a CRC portion and numeral 5 a data recording part. Each sector includes an address part 1 and a data recording part 5. The address part 1, in turn, includes an address mark 2 indicating the beginning of the address part, an address data portion 3, and a CRC portion 4 for checking the same. If the sector address of the n th sector is assumed to be Fig. 2 is a block diagram showing an embodiment of the present invention for recording optical disc information having a recording format as shown in Fig. 1, and Fig. 3 a block diagram showing a device for reproducing data recorded by the recording device shown in Fig. 2. In Fig. 2, numeral 6 designates a control section, numeral 7 an address adder circuit, numeral 8 an encoder, numeral 9 a modulator circuit, numeral 10 a recording reproducing section, numeral 11 an optical disc, numeral 19 an optical pick up, numeral 34 an address decoder, numeral 35 a signal generator. The control section 6 includes a microprocessor or like to determine a sector address. Assuming that a certain data 12 is intended to be recorded, the control section 6 determines a sector where the data is recordable, and applies a write address 13 making up the sector address to the address decoder 34. The control section 6 also applies the write address 13 to the address adder circuit 7 and the recording reproducing section 10. The address adder circuit 7 adds the address 13 to the data 12 and produces a write data 15. The recording reproducing section 10, after rough retrieval of a sector to be recorded with the write address 13, applies reproduction address signals 37 sequentially obtained from the address section 1 of the sectors near the sector to be recorded, to an address comparator 33. The address comparator 33, which binary codes the reproduction address signal 37 and generates an address signal 39, applies it to the address decoder 34. The address decoder 34 decodes the address signal 39, and when detecting a sector involved, applies a coincidence signal 40 to the control section 6. The control section 6, upon receipt of the coincidence signal 40, applies a recording trigger signal 17 to the encoder 8. The encoder 8 performs the encoding of the write data 15 for error control. The encoded data 16 produced from the encoder 8 is modulated and recorded in the data recording part 5. When it is desired to protect the recorded data, the control section 6 applies the address of a sector immediately preceding to the relevant sector as the write address 13. The recording reproducing section 10 supplies the address comparator 33 with the reproduction address signal 37 obtained from the address part 1 of a sector near the sector indicated by the write address 13. The address comparator 33 binary codes the reproduction address signal, and applies the address signal 39 to the address decoder 34. The address decoder 34 applies a coincidence signal 40 to the control section 6 when the write address 13 coincides with the address obtained by decoding the address signal 39. The control section 6 which has received the coincidence signal 40, after a time delay equivalent to one sector, applies a write signal 42 to the signal generator 35 and the recording reproducing section 10. The signal generator 35 applies a predetermined recording signal 43 to the recording reproducing section 10. The recording reproducing section 10 overwrites the recording signal 43 on the address part 1 of the relevant sector. As a result, the address part 1 of the particular sector is overwritten, thereby making subsequent normal reproduction impossible therefrom. In the case where a relevant sector cannot be detected by decoding the address signal 39 by the address decoder 34, on the other hand, the address decoder 34 applies a sector non detection signal 18 to the control section 6. The addresses of successive sectors are generally indicated by ascendant numbers, and therefore, while the recording reproducing head reads the addresses 1 of the sectors sequentially for searching for a target sector, the address decoder produces a sector non detection signal 18 when it fails to detect the coincidence until the result of decoding the address signal 39 exceeds the write address 13. The control section 6 judges the sector of the write address 13 associated with the received sector non detection signal 18 as a bad sector and determines a new write address 13. If the control section 6 designates an already protected sector as a write address 13, the address part 1 of the particular sector is impossible to reproduce, and the write address 13 fails to coincide with the decoded address signal 39, with the result that the particular sector is judged as a bad sector and is never written for protecting the data. An example of overwriting data to make the address part 1 of a sector impossible to reproduce is represented by the methods specified below. A DC signal or other signal which makes it impossible to read the address of the particular sector may be overwritten. In addition to the above mentioned methods, there are various methods of overwriting. Now, explanation will be made about the reproduction. In Fig. 3, numeral 20 designates a decoder, numeral 21 a demodulator circuit, and numeral 27 an output register. When it is desired to read a sector and produce an output, the control section 6 reads the address of the sector and applies it to a comparator 14 as an address 24. A recording reproducing section 10 reproduces the address part 1 of the sector for rough retrieval of a target sector. The data recording part 5 of a sector near the target sector is reproduced, and the reproduced data 29 obtained by demodulation at the demodulator circuit 21 is applied to a decoder 20. The decoder 20 decodes the reproduced data 29, and applies the decoded data 26 and the in data address 28 to an output register 27 and the comparator 14 respectively. The comparator 14 compares the address 24 with the in data address 28, and when they coincide with each other, produces an output trigger signal 25. The output trigger signal 25 causes the output register 27 to produce a stored decoded data 26 as an output data 23. If the read address 24 fails to coincide with the in data address 28 in the comparator 14, by contrast, the decoded data 26 stored in the output register 27 is ignored and the reproduced data in the next sector is collected for similar operation. In this manner, an output can be produced at the same time as completion of fine retrieval of a target sector. In the above mentioned optical disc file device, only the data to be protected is protected, and by the combined rough and fine retrieval of a target sector, the write protection by sector and high speed retrieval are made possible at the same time. Instead of the combined rough and fine retrieval as in the present embodiment, only the fine retrieval may be used for address retrieval to make all the address parts of the sectors written for prevention of overwriting impossible to reproduce. The embodiment under consideration has features that recording is impossible without reading an address part and that means is provided to make an address part impossible to reproduce by referring to a sector address written in the data at the time of reproduction, thus protecting the data written in the sector. A second embodiment of the present invention will be explained. Fig. 4 is a block diagram showing this embodiment of an apparatus for recording data in an optical disc having a recording format as shown in Fig. 1, and Fig. 5 a block diagram of an apparatus for reproducing data recorded by a recording device as shown in Fig. 4. In Fig. 4, numeral 6 designates a control section, numeral 8 an encoder, numeral 9 a modulator circuit, numeral 10 a recording reproducing section, numeral 19 an optical pick up, numeral 11 an optical disc, numeral 33 an address comparator, numeral 34 an address decoder and numeral 35 a signal generator. The control section 6 is made up of a microprocessor or like to determine a sector address. When a data 12 is to be recorded, for example, the control section 6 determines a sector where recording is possible, and applies the write address 13 which is a sector address to the address decoder 34. The control section 6 also applies the write address 13 to the recording reproducing section 10. The recording reproducing section 10 controls the optical pick up 19, and while sequentially reading the addresses 1 of sectors, looks for a sector associated with the write address 13. The reproduced address signal 37 supplied from the recording reproducing section 10 is binary coded by the address comparator 33. In the process, the slice level for binary coding is set at optimum value by the control section 6, is applied as a binary level 31 to the address comparator 33. The address signal 39 which is a signal binary coded by the address comparator 33 is decoded by the address decoder 34 and compared with the write address 13. When both signals are found coincident with each other, a coincidence signal 40 is applied to the control section 6. If both signals fail to coincide after a relevant sector, by contrast, a sector non detection signal 18 is produced and the control section 6 judges the sector as a bad sector and determines a new write address 13. When a relevant sector is discovered, on the other hand, the control section 6 upon receipt of the coincidence signal 40 changes the binary level 31 and sets a slice level which is not optimum to lock for a relevant sector again. The reproduced address signal 37 supplied from the recording reproducing section 10 is binary coded at the binary level 31 by the address comparator 33, and applied as an address signal 39 to the address decoder 34. The address decoder 34 decodes the address signal 39 and compares it with the write address 13 again, so that when both signals coincide with each other, applies the coincidence signal 40 to the control section 6. The control section 6, upon receipt of the coincidence signal 40, applies a recording trigger signal 17 to the encoder 8. The encoder 8 encodes the data 12 for error control, which data is modulated and recorded in the data recording section 5 of the relevant sector. If coincidence is not detected after the relevant sector, on the other hand, the address decoder 34 applies a sector non detection signal 18. The control section 6, upon receipt of the sector non detection signal 18, changes the binary level 31 to an optimum value again, and makes retrieval for the sector immediately preceding to the relevant sector as a write address 13. Upon detection of the sector immediately preceding to the relevant sector, the control section 6, after a time delay of one sector, supplies the write signal 42 to the signal generator 35 and the recording reproducing section 10. The signal generator applies a predetermined recording signal 43 to the recording reproducing section 10. The recording signal 43 is overwritten on the address part 1 of the relevant sector by the recording reproducing unit 10, thereby making subsequent reproduction of the address part 1 of the relevant sector impossible. The method by which the address part 1 of the sector is overwritten to make the address 1 impossible to reproduce is similar to the method used in the first embodiment. Now, the reproduction will be explained. In Fig. 5, numeral 20 designates a decoder, and numeral 21 a demodulator circuit. In the case where it is desired to read and produce a specific sector, the control section reads the address of the sector and applies it as an address 24 to the recording reproducing section 10 and the address decoder 34. The recording reproducing section 10 supplies the address comparator 33 with the reproduced address signal 37 making up a reproduced signal of the address part 1 of a sector near the sector corresponding to the read address 24 sequentially. The address comparator 33 binary codes the reproduced address signal 37 by the binary level 31 set at optimum, and applies it as an address signal 39 to the address decoder 34. The address decoder 34 compares the address signal 39 with the read address 24, and when they coincide with each other, applies a coincidence signal 40 to the control section 6. The control section 6 applies an output trigger signal 25 to the decoder 20. The decoder 20 decodes the reproduced data reproduced from the data recording section 5 and demodulated, and produces it as an output data 23. As will be seen from the foregoing description, according to this embodiment, an address part is reproduced at a reduced reproduction sensitivity and compared with a sector address to be recorded in the recording mode, and if they fail to coincide with each other, that is, when a sector with an unstable address part is detected, a predetermined signal is overwritten on the address part to make the particular address part of the sector impossible to reproduce, so that it becomes impossible to record the same sector but only in a sector with a stable address part, thus making stable data reproduction possible. Now, a third embodiment of the present invention will be described. An optical disc develops many drop outs caused by various defects including flaws as compared with a magnetic medium such as a magnetic disc, and is very high in raw error rate. In reproducing an address part formatted on the optical disc, therefore, the probability of correct reproduction is low with some address parts of unstable reproduction. Also, the reliability of the address part is not always guaranteed by the conditions of the focus or tracking servo for recording or with different optical disc recording reproducing apparatuses. According to the present embodiment, there is provided an optical disc guaranteeing the full reliability of an address, in which by use of the method shown in the second embodiment above, an address is reproduced from a reproduced address signal with a reduced reproduction sensitivity, and the reproduced address is compared with the address of the relevant sector, so that if they fail to coincide with each other, a predetermined signal is overwritten on the address part of the sector thereby to make the particular address impossible to reproduce subsequently. Fig. 6 is a block diagram showing an embodiment of an apparatus for inspecting an optical disc having a recording format as shown in Fig. 1. In Fig. 6, numeral 6 designates a control section, numeral 33 an address comparator, numeral 34 an address decoder, numeral 35 a signal generator, numeral 10 a recording reproducing section, numeral 19 an optical pick up, and numeral 11 an optical disc. The control section 6 includes a microprocessor or the like. When a given sector is inspected, the control section 6 applies the sector address 36 to the recording reproducing section 10 and the address decoder 34. The recording reproducing section 10 controls the optical pick up 19, reads the addresses 1 of the sectors sequentially, and searches for a sector corresponding to the sector address 36. The address comparator 33 binary codes the reproduced address signal 37 from the recording reproducing section 10 by a binary level 31 set to optimum value thereby to produce an address signal 39. The address decoder 34 decodes the address signal 39, and upon detection of the relevant sector, applies a coincidence signal 40 to the control section 6, while when the relevant sector fails to be detected, a sector non detection signal 18 is applied to the control section 6. Upon detection of the relevant sector, the control section 6 reduces the reproduction sensitivity by changing the binary level 31 for retrieval of a relevant sector again. The reproduced address 39 binary coded with a reproduced reproduction sensitivity is applied to the address decoder 34, compared with the sector address 36, and if they are found coincident with each other, the address decoder 34 applies a coincidence signal 40 to the control section 6 to end the inspection concluding that the address part 1 of the relevant sector is fully reliable. If coincidence with the relevant sector address 36 is not detected, by contrast, the address decoder 34 applies a sector non detection signal 18 to the control section 6. The control section 6 changes the binary level signal 31 to an optimum value, detects the sector immediately preceding to the relevant sector, and after time delay of one sector, applies the write signal 42 to the signal generator 35 and the recording reproducing section 10. The signal generator 35 applies a predetermined recording signal 43 to the recording reproducing section 10, which in turn overwrites the address part 1 of the relevant sector to make it impossible to reproduce, thus terminating the inspection of the relevant sector. According to the present embodiment, once the address parts of all the sectors are inspected by an optical disc inspection device, an optical disc having only stable address parts can be provided.
