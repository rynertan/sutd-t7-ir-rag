# Polymer hydrogenation process.

## Abstract
A copolymer of a conjugated diene is hydrogenated in the presence of a first ligand compound containing RhH complex, a second ligand compound which may be the same as, or different from, the first , and a solvent for the copolymer, catalyst and second ligand compound. The process may be conducted as a homogeneous solution hydrogenation, or in the form of an aqueous emulsion.
