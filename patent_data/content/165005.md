## Description
This invention relates to a method for stabilising polymer film or sheet for outdoor use. More specifically, it relates to low density polyethylene LDPE film used in agriculture and horticulture for protecting crops or for maintaining artificial environments more suited, for example by consistently higher humidity and or temperature, to crop growth than the natural environment would be. It is well known that LDPE and similar polymers, e.g. polyolefines, in such applications, are subject to degradation under the influence of energetic solar radiation, oxygen in the air, and thermal stresses. This degradation leads to loss of strength in the film, so that it readily tears or cracks and thus has a limited service life. Many systems have been proposed for stabilising polyolefines such as LDPE against weathering. These systems generally comprise combinations of one or more ultra violet UV stabilisers with other technical adjuvants such as heat stabilisers. For example, GB A 1163875 discloses combinations of nickel dialkyldithiocarbamates, in which the alkyl groups have 4 to 6 carbon atoms, with 2 hydroxy 4 alkoxybenzophenones. GB A 684976 discloses the use of nickel dialkyldithiocarbamates of the formula RR NCSS ₂Ni, in which the total number of carbon atoms in the two alkyl groups R and R is 8 or more. US A 3843595 describes polymers stabilised with a nickel dialkyldithiocarbamate, a phenyl hydroxybenzoate and a zinc dialkyldithiocarbamate, wherein the alkyl groups of the dithiocarbamates have up to 20 carbon atoms. Such systems perform well in laboratory tests and in simple outdoor conditions but, surprisingly, they do not perform as well as expected when used under conditions prevailing in agriculture and horticulture. It has not hitherto been recognised that agricultural and horticultural film is additionally exposed to pesticidal chemicals in a manner that adversely affects its weathering resistance. Chakraborty Polymer, e.g. of LDPE, compositions, containing stabilisers, have now been found which can be resistant to weathering, even in the presence of fumigant chemicals or when exposed accidentally to sprays of other pesticidal chemicals, and which can be innocuous According to the present invention, there is provided a method for protecting flora at an agricultural locus, which comprises using a polymer film or sheet comprising a UV absorber which is a nickel dithiocarbamate of the formula R¹R²NCSS ₂Ni, wherein R¹ and R² are the same or different branched chain C₅ ₁₈ alkyl groups. The polymer is preferably of the thermoplastic as opposed to rubbery type, e.g. a polyolefine such as polyethylene or polypropylene, and most preferably LDPE. The composition is preferably in the form of a film or sheet. Such films or sheets can be used to protect flora at an agricultural or horticultural locus. Examples of R¹ and R² are isoamyl 3 methylbutyl , 2 ethylhexyl and the higher isoalkyl groups which are usually obtained as complex mixtures of alkyl groups branched at various points in the main chain, e.g. in which R¹ and R² each have at least 7 carbon atoms and an aggregate carbon atom number of, for example, 14 to 30 . R¹ and R² are often the same. The effectiveness of corresponding dithiocarbamates in which R¹ and R² are alkyl groups having less than 5 or more than 18 carbon atoms is apparently less than those used in the present invention. Particularly preferred nickel dithiocarbamates are those containing isononyl groups which have sufficient chain length and branching to give good solubility in polymers such as polyethylene while at the same time not diluting excessively the UV stabilising portion of the molecule, i.e. the partial structure N CS S Ni S CS N. A preferred nickel diisononyldithiocarbamate is one in which R¹ R² C₉H₁₉ and the C₉H₁₉ groups contain a major amount of 3,5,5 trimethylhexyl isomer. This material has an acute oral LD₅₀ greater than 16 g kg in the rat and caused no mortality to rainbow trout at a concentration in water of 10 mg litre. The nickel dithiocarbamates of the invention can be used advantageously in combination with other stabilising additives, especially the synergic UV stabilisers such as the hydroxybenzophenones, particularly 2 hydroxy 4 alkoxybenzophenones, e.g. 2 hydroxy 4 octyloxybenzophenone Cyasorb UV 531 and Hostavin ARO 8. Another preferred additive is a zinc dialkyldithiocarbamate of the formula R³R⁴NCSS ₂Zn, wherein R³ and R⁴ are the same or different branched chain C₅ ₁₈ alkyl groups which may be the same as R¹ and R² . The zinc dithiocarbamates function as thermal anti oxidants and have environmental safety and stability to pesticidal formulations of the same order as have the nickel dithiocarbamates. R¹, R², R³ and R⁴ are of course each branched chain alkyl. Corresponding straight chain alkyl dithiocarbamates are generally less soluble in the polymer. This can be observed by incorporating respective dithiocarbamates in, say, polypropylene at various concentrations, and measuring the UV absorbence immediately after compression moulding into films of standard thickness. The UV absorbence of the additive in a polymer is directly proportional to the true solubility of the additive in the polymer. For example, the initial UV absorbences at 285 nm of zinc dihexyldithiocarbamate and zinc dioctylthiocarbamate both straight chain alkyl in polypropylene, at a concentration of 10 ³ mole 100 g, are about 0.7 the corresponding values for zinc di 2 ethylhexyl dithiocarbamate and zinc diisononyldithiocarbamate are between 0.8 and 0.9. The observation can be confirmed by measuring the solubility of the respective dithiocarbamates in a hydrocarbon solvent. Zinc dibutyl , dihexyl and dioctyldithiocarbamates straight chain alkyl have solubility values of 116, 246 and 245 mg 100 g cyclohexane at 30 C the corresponding values for zinc di 2 ethylhexyl dithiocarbamate and zinc diisononyldithiocarbamate are 302 and 311 mg 100 g. The amount of the nickel dialkyldithiocarbamate in a composition of the invention may be from 0.01 to 5, more preferably 0.1 to 1, and often no more than 0.4, part by weight per 100 parts by weight polymer. The composition may comprise an amount of zinc dialkyldithiocarbamate in the same range, if that is included. The invention is illustrated in more detail by the following Examples. All percentages are by weight, unless otherwise indicated. The following abbreviations are used LDPE was mixed in a Brabender Plasticoder with 0.2 HOBP and 0.2 of a UV absorber, and extruded into film at various temperatures. The loss of UV absorber was determined spectrophotometrically. The particular UV absorbers and extrusion temperatures, and the results, are shown in Table 1. It was observed that films containing nickel dithiocarbamate were clear and tinged with green, and this appearance was unaffected by extrusion temperature. The films containing zinc dithiocarbamate were clear, colourless and unaffected by extrusion temperature. Films containing hindered amine were clear and colourless but tended to develop surface bloom when extruded at the higher temperatures. Films containing nickel chelate were clear and faint green but gave off an odour of amine during extrusion and developed bloom and a deeper green at the higher extrusion temperatures. Thus, the nickel and zinc dithiocarbamates did not release decomposition products during processing and did not leave residues in the form of surface bloom. The compression moulded films were exposed to 4 aqueous solutions of soap Lux flakes or methyl isothiocyanate CH₃NCS to simulate exposure to chemicals encountered in agriculture. Methyl isothiocyanate is the volatile decomposition product of the soil sterilising agent Metham Sodium. Soaps and surfactants are commonly used in spray formulations. LDPE films without additives were used as controls. Films were immersed in soap solution for 3 hours at 70 C before irradiation in a UV cabinet. Films were immersed in methyl isothiocyanate solution for 24 hours at 20 C before each period of 175 hours irradiation in the UV cabinet. The extent of degradation of the films was monitored by measuring the carbonyl index. A carbonyl index value of 20 in LDPE corresponds approximately to a 50 reduction in tensile strength after which LDPE film would be unsuitable for further use. The results are shown in Table 2. It can be seen that the nickel dithiocarbamate was resistant to both treatments whereas the hindered amine was affected by soap extraction and the nickel chelate by reaction with methyl isothiocyanate. Compression moulded films were prepared from LDPE blended with equal weights of HOBP and a UV absorber. In Series A, the concentrations were 0.2 HOBP and 0.2 absorber films containing 0.2 HOBP, 0.2 NiDNC and 0.1 ZnDNC were also tested. In Series B, the concentrations were 0.4 HOBP and 0.4 UV absorber, and also 0.1 ZnDNC in combination with 0.4 NiDNC and 0.4 HOBP. The films were immersed in a 4 aqueous suspension of cypermethrin formulation Ambush C for 24 hours at 20 C before a period of 175 hours irradiation in a UV cabinet. LDPE films containing no additive and either untreated or treated with cypermethrin were used as controls. The extent of degradation was monitored by measuring the carbonyl index. The UV absorbers and the results are shown in Table 3. It can be seen from the results on the controls that cypermethrin has a prodegradant effect. The films in Series A were all affected by the treatment but the films containing nickel dithiocarbamate, especially in combination with zinc dithiocarbamate, gave the best protection. At the higher stabiliser concentrations in Series B, the duration of protection is prolonged. This is confirmed by the irradiation times needed to reach a carbonyl index value of 20, which corresponds to a reduction of 50 in the tensile strength of LDPE after which the LDPE is unsuitable for practical use . The irradiation times are given in Table 4. Polypropylene was processed for 10 minutes at 180 C in a RAPRA Torque Rheometer in five series of experiments, three of which were controls using either no additive or a C₄ alkyl dithiocarbamate. The amount of any additive was 0.2 . In each case, samples were subjected to oven ageing at 140 C, to determine thermal oxidative stability, and to irradiation in a UV cabinet to determine the UV stability. The results are given in Table 5.
