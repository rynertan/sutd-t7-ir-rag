# Ionization chamber for smoke detector and the like.

## Abstract
An ionization smoke detector is disclosed in which an electric field is established in an ionization chamber 50 which includes an outer cup shaped electrode 41 defining the chamber and having side wall apertures 44 for permit ting airflow therethrough and a circular inner electrode 70 within the chamber 50 . A radiation source 85 is arranged to produce bipolar and unipolar regions in the chamber 50 . A cylindrical control screen 90 coaxial with the outer elec trode 41 and spaced therefrom is electrically connected to and supported by the inner electrode 70 in the chamber 50 .
