# A voltage control apparatus for electric generators for vehicles.

## Abstract
A voltage control apparatus for an electric generator 2 4 for vehicles includes an armature winding 3 , an exciting coil 4 , a rectifier 2 for rectifying an a.c. output from the armature winding 3 , and a voltage regulator 5 . The voltage regulator 5 comprises a differential amplifier circuit 26 producing a detected voltage corresponding to a difference between a battery charging voltage and a reference voltage, a com parator circuit 30 comparing the detected voltage with a triangular waveform voltage generated at constant periods and producing a pulsed output voltage, a first driver circuit 51 effecting duty factor control of an exciting current flow ing through the exciting coil 4 in response to the pulsed output voltage, and an initial excitation circuit 32 for causing a predetermined small initial exciting current to flow through the exciting coil 4 intermittently during a time interval after the start of the electric generator 2 4 .
