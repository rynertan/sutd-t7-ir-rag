# METHOD OF PRODUCING INSULATING FILM FOR SEMICONDUCTOR SURFACES AND SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE WITH SUCH FILM.

## Abstract
Method of producing an insulating film for semiconduc tor surfaces, in which a silicon substrate is subjected to direct nitriding to thereby produce a film of silicon nitride. The sili con substrate is first subjected to a direct heat nitriding treatment to produce a relatively thick film of silicon nitride. The silicon substrate is then subjected to a nitriding treat ment in aqueous ammonia or an inert gas atmosphere con taining gaseous ammonia, thereby to produce a dense and relatively thick film of silicon nitride. The resultant film of silicon nitride is useful for an insulating film for semiconduc tor devices and also a mask for impurity diffusion or selective oxidation in the production of the semiconductor devices.

## Claims
Claim In a method of forming an insulating film on the semiconductor surface wherein the silicon nitride is generated by directly nitriding the silicon substrate, thus characterized by that the silicon nitride film is formed using at first the nitrogen gas and then ammonia gas or mixed gas with inert gas including ammonia as the reaction gas.

## Description
1. Title of the invention A method of forming an insulation film on semiconductor device surface.2. Detaiied explanation of the invention The present invention relates to a method of forming a stable and dense insulation film in manufacture of a semiconductor device, especially an integrated circuit hereinafter abbreviated as IC .In general, in view of minimizing aging variation of characteristic and improving reliability in manufacture of semiconductor device, an area where the pn junction is exposed on the surface of semiconductor device is often covered with an insulating film. Moreover in the MISFIT and MIS IC, the gate insulating film is adhered for the purpose of inducing the inverting layer channel, and therefore particular stability of characteristic is required. Usually, Si is used as the semiconductor, whileSiO2 as the insulating film and Al as the metal.However, such structure has a disadvantage that the gate threshold voltage varies largely when an electrical field of about 10 V cm is applied to the insulating film at a temperature of 2000C. This phenomenon seems to be occurring as a result of variation of space charge distribution at the interface because there are trapi levels of carrier due to structual defects of St, 2 and drift of impurity ion migrating into the Si02. It is obvious that the effect of such variation of space charge due to the structural defects at the interface of the Si and insulating film becomes most distinctive. For this reason, various coating techniques such as vapor growth method and sputtering etc. have been investigated instead of the thermal oxide SiO2 which easily allows mingle of ions such as alkali ion, but defect at the interface cannot be reduced more than that of the thermal oxide SiO2. On the other hand, the thermal oxide SiO2 produced in a very clean ambient is kept in such a defect of 1011 cm2 in terms of the surface charge density but still there is a defect such as excessive silicon ion etc. at the interface.This is a serious problem.This invention proposes a method developed for solving such a problem of the insulating film formed at the semiconductor surface and particularly relates to a novel method of forming homogeneous silicon nitride film having high density structure directly on the surface of Si.It is a known fact that the nitriding proceeds when the Si substrate is heated in the nitrogen or ammonia ambient, but according to the prior report, it is considered difficult to obtain the homogeneous amorphous Si3N4. The inventors of this invention found the causes. Namely, when the natural oxide film or impurity particle is adhered to Si, the Si3N4 is crystalized due to such substances considered as nucleus and grows or local nitriding proceeds unhomogeneously. It is also found that in case the Si surface is clean, oxidation proceeds as well as the nitriding due to 02 and H20 contained in the nitridation ambient and resultingly growth of homogeneous Si3N4 is blocked.Therefore, the inventors of this invention previously proposed that the contents of 02 and H20 in the nitrogen gas used for growing homogeneous and stable film should be kept at 1 ppm or less. The present invention is based on the following knowledge that the Si3N4 film which can be obtained by the following steps that the Si substrate is directly nitrided at first in the nitrogen gas ambient under the said clean ambient and then directly nitrided in the ammonia gas or the mixed gas ambient of inert gas including ammonia is more minute in the structure and easier to control film thickness than the Si3N4 which can be obtained by the following steps that the Si substrate directly nitrided by using the single gas of the nitrogen gas, the ammonia gas or the mixed gas of the ammonia gas including ammonia as the reAction gas ambient. A In other words, when direct nitriding is performed in the ambient of only the nitrogen gas, the Si3N4 film having k o such thinness of about 150A can be formed within such period as short as 150 seconds as is obvious from the relation between the reaction time and film thickness shown in Fig. 1. er, the refractive index of the Si3N4 film formed as explained above is often as large as 2.3 than the refractive index 1.95 of the ideal SisNj . This means the Si is contained in the Si3N4 film formed by the direct nitriding in the nitrogen gas ambient.On the other hand, in the direct nitriding method using the ammonia gas or mixed gas with an inert gas containing the ammonia gas as the reaction gas, the Si3N4 film as thin as 5C9. even if the reaction time is as long as 200 minutes as is clear from Fig. 2 indicating the relation between the reaction time and film thickness.In Fig. 2, 1 , the reaction temperature is 13000C, while in Fig. 2, 2 , the reaction temperature is 110000 and the 100 ammonia gas is used as the ambient gas. Figure 3 shows the relation between the oxidation time and thickness of silicon oxide film when the silicon substrate a having an exposed surface, the silicon substrate b having the silicon nitride film having the thickness of 75A formed on the silicon substrate surface in said nitrogen gas ambient and the silicon substrate c having the silicon nitride in o the thickness of 40A formed in the ammonia gas ambient are directly subject to the thermal oxidation in the dry oxygen gas at the temperature of 101000. The symbols a , b and c in the figure correspond respectively to above substrates a , b and c .As is clear from Fig. 3, in case of the silicon substrate b , growth rate of the silicon oxide is fast and masking ability for the oxygen is lost by the thermal oxidation process for about 5 hours, while in case of the silicon substrate c , the growth rate of the silicon oxide film is slow and masking ability for the oxygen is not lost even by the thermal oxidation as long as 10 hours. Thus it can be said that the silicon nitride film generated in the ammonia gas ambient is more dense than the silicon nitride film produced in the nitrogen. Moreover, even when the silicon substrate is directly nitrided thermally in the ammonia gas ambient and then subject to the thermal processing in the nitrogen gas ambient, increase of thickness of silicon nitride cannot be observed. It can be so concluded that diffusion of nitrogen is rate determined because of dense structure of the silicon nitride produced in the ammonia gas ambient.The method of forming the silicon nitride film of this invention is based on such characteristics that a thick Si3N4 film is generated in the direct nitriding method where the nitrogen gas is used as the reaction gas and formation of a thick silicon nitride is difficult but dense film can be generated in the direct nitriding method where the ammonia gas or mixed gas with inert gas containing ammdnia is used as the reaction gas, and is characterized by that the silicon nitride film is generated using at first the nitrogen gas and then the ammonia gas or the mixed gas with inert gas containing ammonia using as the reaction gas. Then, detail embodiment of the present invention will be explained below.Figure 4 shows general view of an apparatus for carrying out this invention.

Upon completion of nitriding of a constant amount of the nitrogen gas, then nitriding is performed by changing the reaction gas to the ammonia gas or inert gas 3 containing the ammonia gas from the nitrogen gas.what is intended by the present invention is that the silicon nitride film is formed substantially on the silicon substrate by nitriding the silicon contained in the nitride film generated by the nitrogen gas in the ammonia gas ambientsor the inert ga s including ammonia gas.The silicon nitride film obtained by this invention is equivalent to the silicon nitride obtained by the nitriding of the nitrogen gas in the film thickness but is excellent in the impurity diffusion mask ability and selective oxidation mask ability because of its dense structure and makes possible the manufacture of semiconductor device which ensures very stable electrical characteristic when it is employed into the gate insulating film of the MISFET. As mentioned above, this invention ensures very large extensive effect. 3.
