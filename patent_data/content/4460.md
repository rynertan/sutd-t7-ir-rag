## Description
DESCRIPTIONIMPROVED SYNTHESIS OF 1,4 DIAZA 2 CYCLOALKANONE AND SUBSTITUED DERIVATED THEREOF This invention relates to the synthesis of 1,4 diaza 2 cycloalkanones and substituted derivatives thereof. The increasing use of polymers in place of the more traditional types of structural materials e.g. wood, metals h s necessitated the compounding of such polymers with a variety of stabilizers in order to enhance their ability to withstand prolonged exposure to a variety of degradative forces.Degradation of polymers can be caused by exposure to light, heat and or air. uch deradation is usually manifest by either a partial or total loss of structure integrity, changes in light transmission properties, changes in color, loss or reduction in flexibility and or resiliency, or any combination of the above phenomenon. As will be appreciated, the stabilizers which are used in conjunction with such polymeric materials must, in addition to providing protection against such degradative changes, also be compatible witb the aesthetic properties of the polymeric article and be effective at low concentrations.The economics of the market place dictate that such stabilizers be relatively inexpensive and capable of preparation from readily available starting materials by simple and straigthforward synthesis techniques. Uhe diazacycloalkanones have been found to be highly effective in the stabilization of polymeric materials against the photodegradative forces of ultraviolet lit. The efficacy of such materials in the UV stabilization of polymers is described in copending European Patent Applications Nos. 78 00942.8 and 78 00941.0, both filed on September 20th, 1978. Both the aforementioned applications disclose methods for preparation of the compounds useful in the stabilization of polymer compositions.A third copendin European patent application, No.78 00943.6 which was also filed on September 20th, 1978, discloses a variety of techniques for the convenient synthesis of such highly effective UV stabilizer compounds. The principal advantage of the synthesis described in Application No. 78 00943.6 involves the utilization of readily available starting materials, conventional processing apparatus, the absence of hydrogen cyanide and the atterdant hazards associated therewith. As noted in the section of copendirlg application No. 78 00943.6 entitled Background of the Invention , cycloalkanes have been previously reported as UV stabilizers in the patent literature see for example OLS 2,315,042 JAP Pat. 7,453,571 and 7,453,572 and U.S. Patents 3,919,234 3,920,659 and 3,928,330. This same section also discusses in detail the synthesis of structurally similar compounds and the limitations of such synthesis in the preparation of analogues thereof.To the extent that this discussion is relevant to subject matter of the invention described and claimed hereinafter, it is hereby incorporated by reference. As noted in copendin application No.78 00943.6, the prior art processes discussed therein do not describe convenient techniques for the preparation of poly substituted 1,4 diaza cycloalkanones.The limitations apcarent in such processes are most pronounce where one tempts to synthesize symmetrically substituted compounds. By means of the present invention it is possible to synthesise 1,4 diaza cycloalkanones or symmetrically substituted 1,4 diaza cycloalkanones from readily available starting materials and without the attendant risk involved in the use of hydrogen cyanide. Accroding to the present invention a process for the synthesis of a 1,4 diaza 2 cycloalkanone is provided chabracterised in that a diamine of the formulaEMI4.1 wherein R1 and R2 are independently selected from hydrogen, halogen, alkyl of 1 to 12 carbon atoms, hydroxyalkyl, haloalkyl, canoa1kyl, aminoalkyl, iminoalkyl, ether, nitrosyl, hydroxy alkyl ethers, cyanoalkyl ethers, alkenyl, alkylene and carboalkoxy R3 to R6 being independently selected from alkyl of 1 to 12 carbon atoms, cycloalkyl, hydroxycycloalkyl, aminoalkyl, iminoalkyl, alkenyl, aralkyl and alkylene, provided further that any two of the above hydrocarbon substituents pendant from the same carbon atom can collectively form a cyclic or alicyclic hydrocarbon and n is O to 3 is contacted, in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst, it a stoichiometric excess of an alpha trihaloalkylalcohol of the formula EMI5.1 wherein R7 and R8 are selected from the same group of substituents as R3 to R6 X is halogen and m is a number from C to 5. In order to control the exotherm of this reaction, it is preferable to chill the reaction vessel. In one of the preferred embodiments of this invention, the reactants and catalyst are contracted with one another while dispersed in a non polar organic solvent, such as for example dichloromethane. In a typical embodiment of the process of this invention, an appropriately substituted diamine and an alpha trichloroalkalcohol, in the desired relative concentrations, are introduced into a reaction vessel followed thereafter by the addition to solid vessel of the phase trans formation catalyst dissolved in a non polar organic solvent. The reaction vessel is at lest partially immersed in an ice bath to control the exotherm of the reaction and additional control can be exercised by the dropQvise addition to the reaction medium of predetermined quantities of a highly caustic solution.As a result of the interaction of the materials in the reaction vessel, a water soluble solid is formed. This solid can be removed ftom the non polar reaction medium by filtration or by the addition of water to the reaction vessel followed thereafter by separation of the aqueous phase from the organic fluid layer.The aqueous phase is then further extracted with an organic solvent such as for example chloroform and the combined organic solutions washed with water, dried over sodium sulphate and concentrated. The desired product is crystallized from the combined organic solutions and recrystallized in the conventional fashion to yield a relatively pure product. Compounds within the scope of the above structural formula for the diamines which are especially suitable for use in the process of this invention are the N alkyl 2 alkyl 1,2 alkane diamines, e.g. N isopropyl 2 methyl 1,2 propanediamine. Additional 1,2 diamines which are highly effective for use in the process of this invention include N isopropyl 2 methyl 1.2 propanediamine, N isopropyl 2 methyl 1.2 propanediamine,N t butyl 2 methyl 1,2 propanediamine, N t octyl 2 methyl 1,2 propanedianine, N yeny1 2 mthyl 1,2 propanedianine, ettylenel,2 bis N 2 methyl 1,2 propanediamine 1 and 2,5 dimethyl hexane 2,5 bis N 2 methJl 1,2 propanediamine l. In the preferred embodiments of the process of this invention, the alpha trihaloalkyl alcohol is symmetrically substituted at the ss carbon. One such material which is especially preferred. for use in the process of this invention is l,l,l trichloro 2 methyl 2 propenol hydrate. The alcohols which are highly suitable for use in this process include a trichloromethyl 2 propanol, a trichloromethylcyclohexanol, and trichloromethyl 2 butanol. As noted herein, the above reactants are contacted with one another in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst . The phrase phase transfer catalyst is intended to describe in the context of this invention, any compound, which in the presence of the above reactants, causes a condensation of the alcohol and the diamine in such a fashion so as to result in the formation of a cyclic ketone wherein the oxygen is doubly bonded to an c carbon of the alcoholic reactant. Materials which have been found to effectively catalyze the condensation of the above reactants in this fashion can be represented by the following formula Q B wherein Q is NHaRx, SHaRy or PHaRz provided that R is alkyl of 1 20 carbon atoms, aryl or aralkyl a is O 4, x, y and z are each 0 4 provided further that the sum of a plus x, a plus y, or a plus z equals 4 and B is a monovalent cation, such as for example a halide, acetate, perchlorate, sulfate or hydrosulfate.Catalyst compositions which are preferred for the process of this invention are ammonium salts, for example cetyl trimethylammonium bromide, methyl tricaprylylammonium chloride, cetyl tributyl phosphonium bromide, tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate and tetrabutylammonium chloride. As noted hereinabove, the catalyst initiation of condensation of the above react ant results in eeration of R large exotherm. One means for control of such large exotherm is to dilute the reactants in a suitable reaction medium. In the referred embodiments of this invention such suitable reaction medium will include inert organic solvents such as dichloromethane, DMF, toluene, THF. The process of tkis invention can also be satisfactorily carried out in the absence of solvent provided, other precautions are taken to control the reaction exotherm. It is also possible to control the exotherm of the reaction of this process by maintaining the temperature of the reactants at about 1000 or below e.g.5 to 10 C. . In certain embodiments of tis invention, it may also be advisable to add, by dropwise addition, small quantities of caustic aqueous solution e.g. sodium hydroxide 5C . The detered addition of caustic serves to neutralize the acidic by products of the process and thus provides some additional control over the temperature and the rate of product synthesis. The ratio of reactants to one another in this process is not believed to be critical to the formation of the desired product. over, where one desires to.obtain high yields and ease of separation of the reaction product from the reactants and catalysts used in such preparation, it is preferable to adjust the relative concentration of materials so that the ratio of diamine to alcohol is in the range of from about C.5 to about 1. The 1,4 diaza 2 cycloalkanones produced in accord with the process of this invention, are highly effective, and in lo concentrations, for the stabilization of U7 degradable polymeric materials.
