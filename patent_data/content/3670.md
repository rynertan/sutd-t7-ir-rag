## Description
PREPARATION OF ALKYL 2 ARYL ACRYLATES This invention relates to a method for the preparation of alkyl 2 arylacrylates. In particular the invention is concerned with the preparation of alkyl 2 arylacrylates of the general formula IEMI1.1 wherein R1 and R2 are the same or different and each is hydrogen, C1 to C6 alkyl, halo, C1 to C6 alkoxy or halo alkoxy, C1 to C6 alkylthio or haloalkylthio, nitro, or amino or R1 and R2 R1 and R2 together form a methylene dioxy or halomethylene dioxy group or R1 and R2, together with the benzene ring, form a 2 naphthyl group and R3 is a C1 to C6 alkyl group. Any halogen is usually F, C1 or Br. Some of the compounds of formula I have been described in our copending Australian patent applicationsNos. 19829 76, PD 2818 77 and PD 6995 78, where they are described as intermediates in the production of insecticidally active substituted l phenylcyclopropane carboxylates l phenylcyclobutane carboxylates and 1 2 naphthyl cyclobutane carboxylates, respectively. Furthermore, monomeric acrylates of the general formula I may be used, either alone or with other polymerizable monomers, to produce useful polymers.They can also be used as intermediates in the production of other chemical compounds. Known methods of preparing alkyl 2 arylacrylates involve a three step procedure, such as that described in our copending Application No. 19829 76, i.e., first condensing a phenylacetic ester with a diClower alkyl oxalate in the presence of an alkali metal alcoholate to produce an alkali metal enolate salt, then acidifying .the salt to give the corresponding phenyl oxaloacetate, which is then reacted with formaldehyde under alkaline conditions to give the alkyl 2 phenylacrylate. We have now found that conversion of an arylacetic ester to an alkyl 2 arylacrylate can be achieved in a single reaction step by reacting the starting ester with formaldehyde in the presence of a base in a suitable solvent. Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for the preparation of compounds of the formula I as stated and defined above, which comprises reacting formaldehyde with a aryl ace tic ester of the general formula II EMI3.1 wherein R1, R2 and R3 are as defined above, in a polar solvent in the presence of a base. The base can be an alkali metal alcoholate, an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal oxide, hydroxide, carbonate, bicarbonate or salt of a weak organic acid, generally an aliphatic acid. Nitrogen bases, including aliphatic and aromatic amines, can also be used. The solvent can be any suitable polar solvent, for example, dimethylformamide, dimethylsulphoxide, 1,2 dimethoxyethane, any ethylene glycol ether, or an aliphatic alcohol, e.g. ethanol, propanol or butanol. Water can be present or absent and the fbrmaldehyde can be supplied as paraformaldehyde or as a solution of formaldehyde in water. The preferred solvent base combination is dimethylformamide and potassium carbonate, which gives the best yields of arylacrylates when R1 and R2 are electrondonating groups. Amine bases and protonic solvents, such as aliphatic alcohols and monoethylene glycol ethers, are preferred when R1 and R2 are electron withdrawing substituents. The reaction may be carried out at ambient atmospheric pressure. The reaction temperature will depend on the nature of the substituents R1, R2 on the aryl ring but will generally be between room temperature and about 80 C. The reaction is preferably conducted using, per mole ester,. 1 to 5 e.g. 2 to 4 moles formaldehyde and 0.1 to 5 e.g. 0.1 to 1 moles base. The product arylacrylates may be isolated by normal work up procedures or may be reacted further in situ without isolation. The invention is further illustrated by the following examples.General Method for the reparaticfl af Alkyl 2 Arylacrylates The alkyl arylacetate formula II 0.1 mole is dissolved in dimethylformamide 50 ml and paraformaldehyde 0.2 mole , potassium carbonate 0.1 mole , and calcium oxide 0.1 mole are added at once or in portions over 3 hours. The reaction temperature is kept at 400C and the progress in the formation of the acrylate is followed by gas liquid chromatography. When the starting material has disappeared L5 30 h the reaction mixture is quenched in water and extracted with a solvent ether or dichloromethane .On evaporation of the solvent, essentially pure acrylate is isolated. This can be further purified, if necessary, by chromatography through a short silica column.EXAMPLE 1Ethyl 2 4 ethoxyphenyl acrylate was prepared from ethyl 4 ethoxyphenyl acetate in 58.5 yield using the general method described above. The NMR and infrared spectra of the product were identical with those of an authentic sample prepared via the alkali metal enolate route as described in our Australian patent application No.19829 76, Example A .EXAMPLE 2Ethyl 2 4 alpha a, ss, beta tetrafluoroethoxy phenyl acrylate was prepared from ethyl 4 a, a, beta , f3 tetrafluoroethoxy phenyl acetate in 37 yield using the general method.

The NMR spectrum was consistent with the required structure 6 ppm l.3 triplet 3H , 4.35 quartet 2H , 5.95 singlet, 1H proton of the tetrafluoroethoxy group , 6.13 doublet, 2H CH2 group of the acrylate , 7.3 multiplet 4H aromatic protons .EXAMPLE 3Ethyl 2 4 nitrophenylBacrylate Ethyl 4 nitrophenylacetate t41.8 g was slurried in 200 ml ethanol, 38.5 aqueous formaldehyde solution 31.2 ml and sodium bicarbonate 1 g were added and the reaction mixture stirred for 3 hours at 550C. Most of the ethanol was removed by evaporation and the residue taken up in 50 50 water diethyl ether suspension. After separation the ether layer was washed with water, dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate and evaporated to dryness to yield a faintly yellow viscous oil. This was purified by chromatography on silica gel eluting with dichloromethane to give ethyl 2 4 nitrophenyl acrylate in 10.5 yield. EXAMPLE 4Ethyl 2 4 nitrophenyl acrylate Alternative MethodParaformaldehyde was slurried in 150 ml of 1,2 dimethoxyethane, piperidine 5 g was added and the mixture heated to 70 C. Ethyl 4 nitrophenyl acetate 104.5 g was added and the reaction continued for 20 hours. Most of the 1,2 dimethoxyethane was distilled off under reduced pressure and the residue was taken up in ether and filtered. The filtrate was evaporated to dryness and purified by chromatography on silica gel by eluting with dichloromethane to yield a yellow solid 74.6 g 67 after recrystallization.EXAMPLE 5Ethyl 2 C4 fluorophenyl2 acrylate was prepared from ethyl 4 fluorophenyl acetate by the general method in 51 yield. This compound was obtained in an impure state.However the NMR spectra showed the presence of a doublet 6 5.95 2H characteristic of the acrylate CH2. The yield was confirmed by further conversion of the product to a difluorocyclopropane by reaction of the acrylate with a difluorocarbene and subsequent purification and identification of the difluorocyclopropane.EXAMPLE 6Ethyl 2 4 butoxyphenyl acrylate was prepared from ethyl 4 butoxyphenylacetate in 35 yield using the general method.

EXAMPLE 8Ethyl 2 3, 4 methylenedioxyphenyl acrylate was prepared from ethyl 3,4 methylenedioxyphenyl acetate by the general method in 21 yield as a pale yellow oil.After removal of solvent and starting material the acrylate was not characterised as such but was converted to the corresponding dichlorocyclopropane by reaction with a dichlorocarbene. The N.M.R. and I.R. spectra of the ethyl 1 3, 4 methylenedioxyphenyl 2,2, dichloro cyclopropane carboxylate after purification were consistent with the required structure.
