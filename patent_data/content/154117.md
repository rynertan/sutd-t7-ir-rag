P815 Mastocytoma cells H 2d served as target cells for cytotoxicity assays. They were maintained by weekly intraperitoneal i.p. passage in D2 mice in an ascites form. Hanks balanced salt solution HBSS , RoswellPark Memorial Institute RPMI 1640 medium, fetal calf serum FCS , L glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin,Dulbecco s phosphate buffered saline D PBS and N 2hydroxyethylpiperazine N 2 ethanesulfonic acid HEPES were obtained from Grand Island Biological Cho., GrandIsland, NY. Gentamicin was obtained from Schering Corp.,Kenilworth, NJ. Concanavalin A Con A , ammonium chloride and trichloroacetic acid TCA were obtained from SigmaChemical Co., St. Louis, MO. 2 Mercaptoethanol was obtained from Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY. Lipopolysaccharide LPS, E. coli 0128 B12 was obtained from DIFCOLab., Detroit, MN. Both methyl 3H thymidine 3H TdR, specific activity 20 Ci mmol and 51Cr specific activity 200 500 Ci g chromium were obtained from NewEngland Nuclear, Boston, MA. Preparation of Mouse Lymphocytes Spleens were removed from mice and single cell suspensions were prepared by teasing the spleens apart and rinsing through No. 40 and No. 80 stainless steel mesh screens. Erythrocytes were lysed by a 3 minute exposure to a 0.83 Tris ammonium chloride solution. Cells were washed three times with HBSS and finally suspended in RPMI 1640 culture medium containing 5 FCS, 2mM L glutamine, 5x105M 2 mercaptoethanol, 10mM HEPES, 100 U ml of penicillin, 100 mcg ml of streptomycin and 50 mcg ml of gentamicin referred to as complete medium . Cells were counted in a hemocytometer and the viability was always greater than 90 as judged by trypan blue dye exclusion.TestsProliferative Responses of Lymphocytes to Con A and LPS 2x105 Mouse lymphocytes were dispensed in flatbottom wells of a 96 well culture plate Coster,Cambridge, MA . Con A and LPS were also added to these cultures at predetermined optimal concentrations of 1 mcg ml and 10 mcg ml, respectively. The medium volume was 0.2 ml per culture. After being incubated at 370C, in a 7 carbon dioxide, water saturated atmosphere for 3 days, these cells were pulsed with 0.5 mcCi of 3H TdR for the final 4 hours of incubation and harvested by a cell harvester. Cellular DNA was precipitated on glass fiber filters with 10 TCA and the amount of 3H TdR incorporated was determined in a Beckman liquid scintillation counter. Cultures were always performed in triplicate. Proliferative Response of Mouse Lymphocytes to Alloantigens in Mixed Lymphocyte Cultures MLC 2x105 B6 Responding lymphocytes were cultured together with2l05 D2istitulating lymphocytes, which had been irradiated with 2,000 rads of gamma radiation, in 0.2 ml of complete medium in the flat bottom wells of a 96 well Costar culture plate. The plates were incubated at 370C, in a 7 carbon dioxide, water saturated atmos phere for,5 days. Cells were pulsed with 3H TdR for the final 4 hdurs of incubation and the amount of 3H TdR incor porated was similarly determined by the hereinabove des cribed method. Induction of Alloreactive Cytolytic T Lymphocytes CTL in MLC 107 C57BL 6 Mouse lymphocytes were co cultured with 8x106 irradiated DBA 2 mouse lymphocytes in 4 ml of complete medium in 17x100 mm Falcon culture tubes. The test compounds were initially dissolved in dimethylsulfox ide DMSO and diluted to proper concentrations with cul ture medium immediately prior to testing. All compounds were tested at concentrations of 10 3 to 10 6 mcg ml at which the compounds themselves caused no direct toxicity to lymphocytes. The final content of DMSO was 2 x 10 5 of the original and was shown to have no effect in this system. The MLC were incubated at 370C for 5 days and sensitized cytollytic T lymphocytes CTL were harvested and examined for their cytotoxicity in 51Cr release assay using P815 mastocytoma cells as targets.By comparison with the cytotoxicity of CTL from control MLC, containing no compound, suppression of the generation of CTL by the test compoundEMI6.1 lated by the formula Suppression 100, where A CTL activity fromMLC contain in pound and B CTL activity from control MLC. The results of this test on representative compounds of this invention appear in Table III. Induction of Alloreactive CTL in Animals B6 Mice were sensitized by i.p. injection of 2x107 viable allogeneic P815 cells and subsequently challenged with the same number of P815 cells 10 days later.Lymphocytes were prepared from these mice 2 days after challenge and tested for cytotoxicity.51Cr release Microcytotoxicity Assay P815 Tumor cells were harvested from D2 mouse peritoneal cavities. After being washed once with HBSS, 107 tumor cells were incubated with 100 mcCi 51Cr in 0.5 ml of HBSS at 370C for 60 minutes. Cells were then washed three times and suspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 FCS. 104 Of these 51Cr labeled target cells in 0.05 ml were added to each V shaped well of a Linbro microtiter plate Linbro Chemical Co., Hamden, CT . Effector cells generated in 5 day MLC or from sensitized animals in 0.1 ml of medium were also added to each well at various effector to target cell E T ratios. Unless otherwise noted, results are presented from cultures with an E T ratio of 40 1. Microtiter plates were centrifuged at 40xG for 3 minutes and then incubated at 370C for 3.5 hours.After incubation, the plates were centrifuged at 600xG for 5 minutes, then 0.1 ml of culture medium was carefully removed and the released radioactivity was determined in aPackard gamma counter. The cytotoxicity as percent lysis was calculated from triplicate cultures by ctle rormula lysis E S 100 , where E cpm of 51Cr from experimental cultures ss cpm of 51Cr spontaneously released from labeled target cells and M maximum cpm of 51Cr released from labeled target cells. The results were analyzed statistically. The significance of the difference between control and experimental samples was determined by Student s t test. Results Inhibition of the Proliferative Response of Lymphocytes to Mitogens and Alloantigens 2x105 B6 Lymphocytes were stimulated with Con A or LPS in vitro. 1,4 Bis 2 aminoethyl amino 5,8 dihy droxyanthraquinone dihydrochloride was added at various concentrations to the cultures and its inhibitory effect was determined 3 days later by the reduced amounts of 3H TdR incorporated into cellular DNA. The results appear in Table I,and show that the blast transformation of mouse lymphocytes in response to Con A and LPS significantly decreased with 10 3 and 10 4 mcg ml of 1,4 bis 2 amino ethyl amino 5, 8 dihydroxyanthraquinone dihydrochloride, respectively.Furthermore, the proliferation of these cells was completely abolished by this compound at 1 to 10 2 mcg ml without altering their viability as determined by trypan blue dye exclusion. Alloreactivity of lymphocytes was studied in a one way, 5 day MLC. B6 Lymphocytes were stimulated by D2 lymphocytes and underwent active proliferation as shown in Table II. However, addition of 10 2 and 10 4 mcg ml of 1,4 bis 2 aminoethyl amino 5,8 dihydroxyanthraquinone dihydrochloride significantly prevented this reaction from taking place. Inhibition of CTL Induction in vitro CTL were generated in MLC by mixing B6 with irradiated D2 lymphocytes and 1,4 bisl 2 aminoethyl aminoj 5,8 dihydroxyanthraquinone dihydrochloride was added to some cultures at various concentrations. Effector CTL were harvested from these MLC 5 days later and tested for cytotoxicity using 51Cr labeled Pus15 cells as targets. A concentration of 10 5 mcgXml of this compound significantly decreased CTL activity E lysis 37.0 p 0.01 when compared to control CTL lysis 45.7 . A complete failure to generate CTL was observed with 1 to 10 4 mcg ml of the compound. In order to determine the time necessary to induce immunosuppression, 10 3 mcg ml of 1,4 bist 2 amino ethyl aminol 5,8 dihydroxyanthraquinone dihydrochloride was added to MLC at different time intervals. As shown inTable IV, CTL was almost totally absent in cultures when this compound was added at the same time as lysis 2.7 or one day after lysis 6.4 the initiation of the experiment. CTL became detectable when the compound was added 2 days after setting up MLC lysis 22.0 , but the activity was still significantly less than that of control lysis 52.0 p 0.001 . The duration of the suppressive effect of 1,4 bis 2 aminoethylZamino3 5,8 dihydroxyanthraquinone dihydrochloride was studied by adding this compound to cultures at 10 3 mcg ml and then removing the compound from 1 MLC each day by thoroughly washing the cells with HBSS and reculturing in fresh medium. Five days after initiation of the test, CTL were harvested and tested for cytotoxicity. The results, shown in Table V, clearly indicate that the suppression induced by this compound was irreversible, regardless of when the compound was removed from the cultures. Immunosuppression by 1,4 bis 2 aminoethyI amino 5, 8 dihydroxyanthraquinone dihydrochloride was compared on a weight to weight basis with adriamycin, cyclosporin A and NovantroneTM 1,4 dihydroxy 5,8 bis 2 2 hydroxy ethylamino ethyl amino anthraquinone dihydrochloride U. S. Patent 4,197,249 . As shown in Table VI, when compared to control CTL generated in drug free MLC, the minimum doses required to cause a significant effect were NovantroneTM 10 3 mcg ml Adriamycin io1 mcg ml Cyclosporin A 10 2 mcg ml. A consistent failure to generate CTL by 1,4 bis 2 aminoethyl amino 5,8 dihydroxyanthraquinone dihydrochloride at 10 4 mcg ml shows the superior potency of this compound in depressing alloreactivity. The evidence present in Tables I VI show that 1, 4 bis 2 aminoethyl amino 5, 8 dihydroxyanthraquinone dihydrochloride is highly effective in preventing the induction of CTL in vitro.Immunosuppression in vivo B6 Mice were treated i.p. with 3 mg kg of body weight of 1,4 bisl 2 aminoethyl amino 5,8 dihydroxyanthra quinone dihydrochloride and lymphocytes were prepared from these mice 2 weeks later. These cells were stimulated inMLC with D2 stimulatory cells for 5 days and the CTL were harvested and tested for cytotoxicity. As shown inTable VII as compared to CTL generated in normal untreated mice, lymphocytes from drug treated mice failed to become effective CTL at all E T ratios tested. The optimal in vivo dose and timing of the treatment was determined by treating B6 mice with 0.3 to 3.0 mg kg of body weight of the test drug and MLC were set up from these mice at various time intervals. The results in Table VIII show that at day 10 after treatment lymphocytes from all treated mice failed to respond to alloantigens in vitro, thus showing no CTL activity. At day 23 post treatment, a typical CTL generation was evident only in normal mice and mice treated with 0.3 mg kg of the test compound. After 30 days of treatment, effector cells generated in mice receiving 0.3 and 0.75 mg kg test com pound manifested a normal level of cytotoxicity whereas lymphocytes from mice treated with 1.5 and 3.0 mg. kg. of test compound were still unable to do so, proving the potent and long lasting inhibitory effect of this compound. Evidence for the Presence of Suppressor Cells in Treated Mice B6 Mice were treated with 3 mg kg of body weight with 1,4 bis 2 aminoethyl amino 5,8 dihydroxyanthra quinone dihydrochloride and lymphocytes were obtained 5 weeks later. These cells were added to a conventional MLC consisting of 107 normal B6 lymphocytes and 5x106 ir radiated D2 lymphocytes. As shown in Table IX, addition of 1 5x106 cells from drug treated mice significantly pre vented normal lymphocytes from becoming effective CTL indicating the existence of suppressor cells in the spleens of treated mice, and effect which is dose related. To summarize, the compounds of this invention have a potent suppressive effect on cellular immune responses in vitro and in vivo. Addition of one such compound tD cultures significantly decreased the prolifera tion responses of lymphocytes to Con A, LPS and alloanti gens Tables I and II . A complete inhibition of prolifer at ion demonstrated with 1 to 10 2 mcg ml of this compound was not the result of direct toxicity since the viability of treated cells remained unaltered as judge by trypan blue dye exclusion. Induction of alloreactive CTL was also significantly lessened by all of these compounds in MLC Table III . In order to achieve a significant effect the compound had to be added within the first 3 days of a 5 day MLC indicating that the inductive phase was the period most susceptible Table IV .The irreversible effect was also evidenced by the failure of pretreated lymphocytes to respond to antigens after the compound was removed Table V . This contributes to an unusual long lasting immunoincompetence in animals Table VIII . These compounds are clearly superior to NovantroneTM, adriamycin and cyclosporin A in depressing CTL induction Table VI .This is particularly significant in view of the fact that cyclosporin A has been proven clinically useful in organ transplantation Calme, R.Y., Immunol. Rev., 46, 113 1979 .

This aspect of the invention includes novel compositions of matter containing the compounds of this invention and the method of inducing suppression of the immune response system in mammals when administered in amounts ranging from about one mg to about 50 mg per square meter of body surface area per day. The interrelationship of dosages for animals of various sizes and species and humans based on mg m2 of surface area is described byFreireich, E. J., et al., Quantitative Comparison afToxicity of Anticancer Agents in Mouse, Rat, Hamster, Dog,Monkey and Man. Cancer Chemother. Rep., 50, No. 4, 219 244,May 1966.A preferred dosage regimen for optimum results would be from about 3 mg m2 day to about 50 mg m2 day, and such dosage units are employed that z total of from about 5 mg to about 125 mg of the active compound for a subject of about 70 kg of body weight are administered in a 24 hour period. This dosage regimen may be adjusted to provide the optimum therapeutic response. For example, several divided doses may be administered daily or the dose may be proportionally reduced as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. The active compound may be administered by the intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous routes. The active compounds may be administered parenterally. Solutions or dispersions of the active compound can be prepared in water suitably mixed with a surfactant such as hydroxypropylcellulose. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and mixtures thereof and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms. The pharmacutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like , suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils.The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars or sodium chloride.Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monosterate and gelatin. Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the active compound in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various of the other ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the various sterilized active ingredient into a sterile vehicle which contains the basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above.In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and the freeze dying technique which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile filtered solution thereof. As used herein, pharmacutically acceptable carrier includes any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents and the like. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatable with the active ingredient, its use in the therapeutic compositions is contemplated. Supplementary active ingredients can also be incorporated into the compositions. It is especially advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the mammalian subjects to be treated each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the novel dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by and directly dependent on a the unique characteristics of the active material and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and b the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an active material for the treatment of disease in living subjects having a diseased condition in which bodily health is impaired as herein disclosed in detail. The principal active ingredient is compounded for convenient and effective administration in effective amounts with a suitable pharmacutically acceptable carrier in dosage unit form as hereinbefore disclosed. A unit dosage form can, for example, contain the principal active compound in amounts ranging from about 2 mg to about 200 mg, with from about 5 to about 125 mg being preferred.Expressed in proportions, the active compound is generally present in from about 2 to about 100 mg ml of carrier. In the case of compositions containing supplementary active ingredients, the dosages are determined by reference to the usual dose and manner of administration of the said ingredients. Suppression of the immune system is attained, for example, using parenteral administration. A single intravenous dosage or repeated daily dosages can be administered. Daily dosages up to about 5 or 10 days are often sufficient. It is also possible to dispense one daily dosage or one dose on alternate or less frequent days. As can be seen from the dosage regimens, the amount of principal active ingredient administered is a sufficient amount to induce and enhance immunosuppression, in the absence of excessive deleterious side effects of a cytotoxic nature to the hosts.
