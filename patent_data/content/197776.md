# Preparation of porous bodies.

## Abstract
A process for the preparation of at least one porous oxide or hydroxide body comprises i adding at least one body comprising a sol of the oxide or hydroxide to a fluid freezing medium such as liquid nitrogren contained in beaker 26 and ii raising the temperature of the solid, quenched sol so that solvent nucleation occurs, resulting in the formation of crystals of the dispersion medium, and the dispersion medium melts thereby leaving one or more porous oxide or hydroxide bodies.
