# Process for preparing indole.

## Abstract
An industrial process involves preparing indole by reacting aniline and ethylene glycol in the vapor phase over a catalyst high boiling point impurities and non volatile sub stances are removed from the reaction mixture either before recovering aniline from the reaction mixture or subsequent ly, but in any event before rectification of the resultant indole. Removal of the high boiling point impurities and non volatile substances before rectification leads to a high purity rectified product substantially uncontaminated by aniline.
