# Control of residual solvent in oat products.

## Abstract
An improvement in a process for the treatment of pro teinaceous material, wherein the proteinaceous material is admixed with a hydrocarbon solvent for any oil in the pro teinaceous material and at least a fraction of the proteinace ous material is separated from the solvent and treated for removal of residual solvent, is disclosed. The improvement is characterized by a maintaining the temperature of the admixture of proteinaceous material and solvent in the range 0 35 C, and b controlling the period of the time of contact of solvent and proteinaceous material and the period of the time of treatment for removal of residual solvent, whereby separa tion of a product having a level of residual solvent of less than 60 ppm may be effected. The proteinaceous material may be comminuted oats or matter derived therefrom. Products hav ing low residual solvent may be obtained. Such products may be used in the food industry.
