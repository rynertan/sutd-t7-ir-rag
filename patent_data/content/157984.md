# High impact nylon composition.

## Abstract
High impact nylon molding compounds are provided by maleating an ethylene propylene copolymer at an elevated temperature in the presence of an organic peroxide initiator and thereafter grafting the maleated adduct thus prepared onto the free amino end group of a nylon polymer, such as nylon 6 or nylon 66, at an elevated temperature, illustratively by extrusion. A reinforced composite is obtained by extru sion compounding the grafted nylon polymer with glass fi ber.
