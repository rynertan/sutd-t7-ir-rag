# Multi contact electrical connector.

## Abstract
A multi contact electrical connector for electrically con necting a plurality of wires 35 to a printed circuit board 3 . The connector includes an open topped housing 10 includ ing a plurality of contact chambers 11 , wire holding portions 17,18 and terminal receiving bores 15 with the terminal receiving bores 15 intersecting the lower portions of the contact chambers 11 and extending in parallel with wire 35 engaged in the wire holding portions 17,18 , each of the wire holding portions 17,18 including means where by the wire 35 placed therein is securely held, each of the contact chambers 11 including a contact 25 including a pair of press means 26,26 with a space 27 therebetween, the space 27 being narrower than the diameter of the conductor 36 of the wire 35 whereby the insulating coverage 37 of the wire is broken by the side ridges of the press means 26,26 thereby to allow the conductor 35 to make electrical contact with the contact 25 , the contact 25 also including means 31 whereby the respective terminal 1 inserted in the terminal receiving bore 15 is detachably held to effect electrical connection therebetween.
