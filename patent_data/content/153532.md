# Apparatus for applying liquid for a rolling mill.

## Abstract
An apparaus for applying liquid to mill rolls is described which has a bar 12, 14 with two longitudinally extending manifolds 28, 30 . Into the bar are inserted spray nozzles 22, 24, 26 and associated diaphgragm valve structures 36 . One of the manifolds 28 is for the supply of coolant and or lubricating fluid to the nozzles via the valves 36 . The other manifold 30 has a control fluid air under pressure which is used to operate the diaphragm valves 36 to connect or disconnect the supply of coolant lubricant. To control the control fluid each diaphragm valve unit 36 has a solenoid operated valve 98 for selectively connecting the air at pressure in the second manifold 28 to the diaphragm valve 36 .
