## Description
The invention relates to a method of operating an absorption heat pump or refrigerator, consisting at least of a refrigerant circuit and a refrigerant con taining solution circuit, with a generator for evapor ating refrigerant from the solution with the supply of relatively high temperature heat, a condenser for con densing refrigerant and giving up heat at an intermedi ate temperature level, an evaporator for evaporating re frigerant with the absorption of heat from a relatively cold heat source, a heat exchanger for transferring heat from the liquid passing out of the condenser to the refrigerant vapour and liquid coming from the evaporator, an absorber for absorbing refrigerant vapour into the solution with the giving up of heat at an intermediate temperature level, and means for circulating the solution or maintaining the pressure. A method of this kind is known from Plank, R., Handbuch der Kaltetechnik 1959 , Part VII, particu larly pages 10 to 19. In the apparatus described there a heat exchanger, also referred to as an after cooler, afterevaporator, or liquid cooler, can be included, in which condensate coming from the condenser is cooled by heating vapour and evaporating any entrained liquid. The action of this heat exchanger is described on page 13 and on pages 182 to 188 in the work referred to above. In an apparatus of the type first described above it is desired to achieve optimising regulation of the refrigerant delivery D It has now been found that this power of the apparatus can be increased by applying a method of the type first described above, which is characterized in that the delivery of refrigerant is regulated in such a manner that the temperature differential Δ This regulation will be referred to hereinbelow as four temperature control. According to the four temperature control of the method of the invention the heat ratio of the heat pump, that is to say the quotient of the power output and the power supplied to the gener ator, or the refrigeration factor of the refrigerator, that is to say the quotient of the power received in the evaporator and the power supplied to the generator, is substantially increased, particularly if the temperature of one or more of the heat sources and or the various output temperatures vary considerably. For this purpose the delivery of refrigerant is regulated in such a manner that the difference ΔΔ t between Δ t In the present description the expression heat source is to be understood to mean any medium from which heat can be taken, for example air, earth, water either flowing or still , foodstuffs. In order to enable the heat pump or refrigerator to work in a stable manner, the delivery of refrigerant is preferably also regulated on the basis of the dif ference Δ t between the temperature t The invention also relates to an absoprtion heat pump or refrigerator which consists at least of a re frigerant circuit and a refrigerant containing solution circuit, with a generator for evaporating refrigerant from the solution with the supply of heat at a relatively high temperature, a condenser for condensing refrigerant and giving up heat at an intermediate temperature level, an evaporator for evaporating refrigerant with the absorption of heat from a relatively cold heat source, a heat exchanger for transferring heat from the liquid passing out of the condenser to the refrigerant vapour and liquid coming from the evaporator, an absorber for absorbing refrigerant vapour into the solution with the giving up of heat at an intermediate temperature level, and means for circulating the solution or maintaining the pressure, which heat pump or refrigerator is characterized in that at the inlets and outlets respectively of the heat exchanger there are disposed, in or on the four pipes or members connected thereto, temperature sensors which are connected via a regulating means to a regulable valve throttle means , whereby the supply of the refrigerant to the evaporator is controlled. The invention further relates to an apparatus of the abovedescribed type, in which there are disposed both at the site of the heat source and in the evaporator, or close thereto, temperature sensors which are connected via a regulating means to the regulable valve controlling the supply to the evaporator. This regulation with the aid of temperature sensors at the site of the heat source and in or near the evaporator is preferably connected in cascade with the regulation with the aid of four tempera ture sensors at the site of the inlets and outlets of the heat exchanger, the latter regulation optimizing the desired value of the former. For an effective action of the four temperature control according to the invention it is desirable for the liquid side of the heat exchanger to be continuously completely filled with liquid. The invention is explained more fully below with reference to the accompanying drawings. Figure 1 shows schematically a continuously acting absorption heat pump which can be operated in accordance with the invention. The components are as far far as possible set out in a p T diagram, which clearly shows where the pressure or temperature is relatively high or low. In a generator 1 refrigerant is driven out of the solution of refrigerant and solvent by the supply of heat Qg. The generator 1 may be provided with a rectifier 2 in which the refrigerant vapour is freed from at last a part of the likewise evaporated solvent and the heat Q Figure 2 shows on a larger scale a part of the apparatus shown in Figure 1. In this Figure, Δt Figures 3a and 3b are block diagrams of the regu lation procedures which can be applied in accordance with the invention. The symbols used here, insofar as they have not previously been explained, have the following meanings r value adjusted. c difference between value measured and value ad justed. The apparatus according to the invention can be operated with pairs of substances customarily used in apparatus of this kind, for example ammonia and water. The refrigerant need not be completely pure and may still contain a small amount of solvent. According to the present invention the evaporator used is a continuous flow evaporator, for example a coil evaporator, from which any unevaporated refrigerant is entrained by the current of vapour. The application of the principle according to the invention is not restricted to the apparatus shown in Figure 1, and it can be applied in an absorption heat pump or absorption refrigerator of any type.
