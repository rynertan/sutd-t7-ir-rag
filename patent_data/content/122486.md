# Electrical connectors with quasi terminal pins.

## Abstract
An electrical connector for electrically connecting termi nal pins 23 of a circuit package to a circuitry of another circuit board having quasiterminal pins 34, 34 for elastically pre bending pairs of spring arms 312, 313 of contact elements 31, 31 in the connector. The connector is provided with an insulator base member 32 for embracing the contact ele ments 31, 31 , and an insulator cover member 33 slidably overlying the base member 32 . The base member 32 has recesses 321 for permitting the spring arm pair 312, 313 to elastically bend. The cover member 33 has penetrating holes 331 for introducing the conductive pins 23 into the recesses 321 . The quasi terminal pins 34, 34 are attached to the cover member 33 adjacent to the penetrating holes 331 , respectively, each of which is inserted between the spring arms 312, 313 and are in press contact with them. Thus, the spring arms 312, 313 are pre bent to facilitate an insertion of the terminal pin 23 into a space between spring arms 312, 313 . The circuit package is adapted to the connector so that the terminal pins 23 are introduced into the recesses 321 through the penetrating holes 331 . When the circuit package is slided along the base member 32 , each of the terminal pins 23 is laterally shifted to be inserted into a space between the spring arms 312, 313 and then each of quasi terminal pins 34, 34 is shifted to go away from the spring arms 312, 313 . Therefore, the terminal pins 23 are pinched between the spring arms 312, 313 to thereby be electrically connected to the contact elements 31, 31 . Preferably, each of the spring arms 312, 313 is provided with a guide leaf 318, 319 for guiding insertion of the quasi terminal pin 34, 34 which is inserted thereinto.
