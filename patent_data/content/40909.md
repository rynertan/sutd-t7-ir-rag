## Description
Fluid Pressure Control ValvesThis invention relates to fluid pressure control valves and relates especially to fluid pressure control valves which are suitable ror use in installations such as required for braking systems of vehicles and which may be subject to violent mechanical vibrations or shock.In the Specification of U.K. Patent No. 1,174,243 there is described and claimed a fluid pressure control valve having a restricted flow inlet port and an outlet port, an exhaust port providing a valve seat and a throttle element movable towards and away from the valve seat thereby to effect a varying degree of throttling to the passage of fluid through the valve seat, a cantilever mounted leaf spring, the free end or which is operatively engageable by the throttling element and loading means by which the free end or the leaf spring can be loaded such that in operation of the valve when a fluid pressure of predetermined value pertains at the input port, the value of the fluid pressure pertaining to the output port is dependent upon the rate of escape of fluid through the valve seat which rate is in turn determined by the degree of throttling effected by the throttling element consequent upon the degree of loading of the leaf spring by said loading means.Control valves such as the foregoing have been found to be sensitive to vibrations and shock when employed in fluid pressure operable braking systems for controlling a braking pressure and a satisfactory solution has been employed which makes use of an hydraulic damper to resist deflection of the leaf spring due to such shocks and vibrations without appreciably affecting the normal mean deflection due to a steady electromagnetic loading of the leaf spring.It has been found, however, that with such a damping system. certain forms of shock can produce undesired temporary deflection of the leaf spring and the need to provide seals to contain the damping fluid has been considered to be a disadvantage owing to the possibility of eventual leakage. It is therefore an object of the present invention to remove or substantially reduce such shortcomings.According to the present invention, there is provided a fluid pressure control valve having a restricted fluid flow inlet port, a vent port provided with a variable throttle arrangement and a fluid pressure outlet port connected to a region between the inlet port and the vent port, the variable throttle arrangement comprising a force applying means carried to one side of a support point of a substantially rigid beam which is resiliently supported for angular movement about said support point and having counterbalancing mass at the other side thereof to render the valve substantially insensitive to shock forces acting through said support point. In order that the invention may be more clearly understood and readily carried into erfect, the same will be further described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawing or which Fig. 1 illustrates in diagrammatflcal rorm an electropneumatic converter valve embodying the present inven tion andFig. 2 illustrates the manner of resiliently supporting the beam of the device for angular movement.In Fig. 1 is shown a block 1 which houses the pneumatic parts of the electro pneumatic converter valve and comprises a pressure input port 2, a vent port 3 and a fluid pressure output port 4 connected to a region 5 between the restricted input port 2 and the variably vented port 3. The source of fluid pressure for the electro pneumatic converter is connected at a port 6 from which it is applied via a pressure regulating valve having a valve closure member 7 to a chamber 8. Control means for the pressure regulating valve 7 comprises a diaphragm 9 adjustably spring loaded by a spring 10 with adjustment screw 11. The variable throttle arrangement for the vent port 3 is provided by virtue of a valve member 12 in the form or a ball which, in the position shown. closes the region 5 from atmosphere.The details of the components in block 1 are nnly shown diagrammatically because this position of the valve is almost identical to the valve described and shown in Fig. 1 of United Kingdom Specification No. 1,174,243.In order to urge the ball 12 against its seat to closeoff the region 5, an electro magnetically operable loading means is provided, the loading produced by which is dependent upon the current flowing in a cylindrical coil 13 movable axially in an annular space 14 between an annular pole 15 and an inner cylindrical pole 16 of a permanent magnet arrangement.The permanent magnet arrangement comprises a cylindrical permanent magnet 17 clamped between a flange 18 of the central pole piece 16 and the annular pole piece 15 by clamping screws, one of which is shown at 19, through a non magnetic pillar 20. The whole magnetic assembly is thereby mounted on the block 1. The cylindrical coil 13 is wound upon a coil former 21 carried at its centre on a supporting arrangement comprising a central boss 22 in a non magnetic support plate 23 carried to one side of the support point 24 of a rigid beam 25. The other side of the beam 25 with respect to the support point 24, carries static counter balancing weights in the form of washers 26, or the like.Optionally. moreover, a biasing spring 27 can be included beneath the beam 25 and retained between the mounting stud 28 for the counter balancing weights, on the one hand, and a recess 29 in the upper surface of a base member 1. The bias on the spring maybe varied by adjustment of the position of a spring follower 27a on one end of the stud 28. This spring is included as such an option in order to modify the operating characteristics of the valve.The manner of resiliently supporting the beam 25 for angular movement is illustrated in Fig. 2 wherein the beam 25 is shown together with the counter balancing weights 26. The support point for the beam is fixed to the underside of a pair of blocks 30 and 31 which clamp the middle portion of a strip of spring metal 32, the ends of which are held in support blocks 34 and 35 which in turn are mounted on the base block 1 of the electro pneumatic converter. The small amount of angular movement which is required of the beam 25 is thereby permitted by the portions or the springmaterial strip 32 between the outer blocks 34 and 35 and the blocks 31 and 32 beneath which the beam is supported. Furthermore, in assembling the device, the counter weights 26 are adjusted to substantially counter balance the mass of the coil assembly which is carried at the other side of the beam with reference to the support point 24. Preferably, this balancing is effected before final assembly of the device.In operation of the electro pneumatic converter ofFig. 1. fluid pressure is supplied from a reservoir to the port 6 from whence it passes via the valve 7 into the small reservoir 8 provided in the base block of the valve. This pressure acts on the upper side of the diaphragm 9 and upon reaching a value at which the spring 10 is sufficiently deflected to permit closure of the valve 7, the pressure in the reservoir 8 ceases to increase further. The pressure thus established in the reservoir 8 is maintained from 6 and communicated via the restricted orifice of input port 2 to the region 5 with a pressure drop which is determined by the degree of throttling provided by the member 12 restricting vent port 3.Assuming that the device is required to produce an output pressure which is variable in proportion to the current which is fed to the coil 13. the optional spring 27 will be excluded from the assembly and the sense of energisation of the coil 13 will be such as to cause downward urging of the member 12 with increasing current. Correspondingly progressively increasing force on the member 12 therefore progressively increases the pressure which is necessary to effect unseating of 12 and this pressure appears as the output pressure at port 4.Assuming now that the device is required to operate as an inverse device or, in braking parlance, in energise to release mode, a suitable spring 27 is included and, under these conditions, with zero current applied to the coils 13, the output pressure can approximate to the predetermined pressure of the reservoir 8 since there will be negligible pressure dro fl the restriction 2 and the vent valve 3. With increasing current in the coil 1 , the thrust exerted by the spring 27 acting via the beam 25 downwardly on the member 12, is increasingly relieved by increasing current and therefore progressively greater pressure drop occurs across the restriction 2 to produce a progressively reducing pressure in the region 5 which appears at the output port 4.It will be appreciated that the device operates in the same manner as the above acknowledged previous device to the extent that the output pressure at the port 4 is the result of sharing of pressure drop of the pressure 8 between the input restrictive port 2 and the variable vent port 3.The spring 27 exerts through the pivoted beam 25 a downward thrust on ball 12 tending to increase the output pressure at port 4. In an alternatively modified construction this downward thrust is provided by a twist in the spring strip 32 in the appropriate sense.If the fluctuations in the pressure of the fluid supply connected to port 6 are relatively small then the pressure regulating valve 7 comprising diaphragm 9, spring 10 and adjusting screw 11, and the chamber 8 may be omitted in which case port 6 is connected directly to the restricted port 2. By virtue of the mounting arrangement for the energising coil 13 on one side of the pivot point of a beam resiliently supported for angular movement about the pivot point and the other side of which beam is counter balanced by the weights 26, vertical disturbances acting on the assembly produce negligible intermittent variations of the force on the member 12 and therefore the output pressure remains unaffected. Since, in railway braking applications, either in locomotives or on rolling stock, it is normally possible to mount the assembly such that whilst it may be subjected to vertical and horizontal shocks from any direction to which it is insensitive, rotational shocks are at least rare if not totally non existent in normal operation and therefore the electro pneumatic converter described is extremely reliable for this particular application and will find application in other fields where a reliable electro pneumaeic converter is required which is not susceptible to shocks or vibrations.
