# Glassware forming machine computer RAM controller system.

## Abstract
A programmable automatic controller for operating a section of a glassware forming machine having a plurality of components which operate in a timed or sequential relationship with one another. The controller includes a timing means 100 for generating a digital signal in synchronism with the operation of the machine, wherein the digital signal provides an instantaneous indication of the time elapsed in each cycle of operation of the machine. A random access memory RAM stores the status of every section component at each increment of time during each cycle of machine operation. The digital signal addresses the RAM so that the statuses of all components for the corresponding time are directed to drivers which provide component enable or inhibit command signals. Control means for adjusting the actuation and deactuation times of the section components provide information to a computer 102 which updates an internal memory table organized similarly to the RAM. The computer 102 also controls the transfer of data from the internal table to the RAM in such a way that the data updating speed of the control computer is independent of the machine cycle speed.
