# Modular, self supporting flight of stairs.

## Abstract
A modular, self supporting flight of stairs, comprising at least one pair of stringer units 3 for supporting at least one step tread 7 . Each stringer unit comprises a vertical side plate 11 provided with an horizontal, upper flange 13 and a vertical front plate 21 defining with the side plate, a rectangular dihedron. This front plate 21 is also provided with an horizontal, upper flange 23 defining together with the upper flange of the side plate, a rigid, L shaped support very stable in use for supporting one end of the tread 7 . Each stringer unit 3 also comprises a small, fixation plate 27 integrally extending the side plate 11 in the same plane as, or in a plane parallel to, the plane of the side plate 11 . The stringer units 3 of each pair are fixed to the correspond ing units of a pair immediately superior or inferior thereto by riveting or bolting the fixation plates of one pair to the side plate of the other pair through a plurality of holes 19,29 punched in the fixation plate and the lateral plate of the stringer units for receiving the rivets or bolts 37 . This flight of stairs is particularly interesting because it has an excellent lateral stability due to the presence of the stabilizing front plates 21 of each pair of stringer units on the upper flanges 23 of which is fixed each tread 7 , and because it also may support a very heavy load due to the punched holes 19,29 used for riveting or bolting the stringer units 3 together, the punching indeed providing some engagement of the holes one inside the other during the riveting or bolting step and thus ensuring an improved reinforcement of the flight against any vertical shearing force.
