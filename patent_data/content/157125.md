## Description
This invention relates to an instruction prefetching device according to the preamble of claim 1 for use in a data or information processing system in prefetching an instruction sequence including a branch instruction which may or may not be a branch count instruction. An instruction prefetching device according to the preamble of claim 1 is known from IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin, Vol.14, no.3, August 1971, page 867, New York, US T.A. Enger Instruction sequence branch control . In prior art instruction prefetching devices, a considerably long loss cycle is inevitable whenever a branch instruction appears in the instruction sequence and particularly when the branch instruction is a branch count instruction. An improved instruction prefetching device is described in principle in an article contributed by Erich Bloch et al to IEEE, Computer, April 1978, pages 64 76, under the title of Component Progress Its Effect on High Speed Computer Architecture and Machine Organization and is disclosed as a practical structure in JP A 76,638 82 prefetch of the instruction sequence is carried out upon appearance of a branch instruction by predicting a branch destination or target based on prior results of actual execution of the branch instruction in question. When the prediction is correct, the prefetch proceeds without the loss cycle. The loss cycle, however, becomes three machine cycles long when the prediction fails. In the manner which will later be described with reference to one of about thirty figures of the accompanying drawing, the loss cycle amounts to a little longer than two machine cycles on the average. An instruction prefetching device based on a different principle, is revealed in JP A 59,253 82. The device includes an instruction cache memory which comprises a plurality of instruction blocks for holding copies of a portion of an instruction area of a main memory. A branch information memory comprises a plurality of information blocks which correspond to the respective instruction blocks. When a branch instruction is held in one of the instruction blocks, the corresponding information block is loaded with a result of execution which has ever been carried out on the branch instruction. Another information block is loaded with an address of an instruction block. The last mentioned instruction block holds an instruction which should very likely be prefetched next subsequent to the branch instruction. An access to the first mentioned instruction block and simultaneously to the corresponding information block, is followed by an access to the other information block. An instruction sequence is prefetched at an appreciably high speed. The device is, however, capable of attaining a low accuracy of prefetch due to the prediction by block to block correspondence when two or more branch instructions are held in an instruction block. According to the elder EP A 109 655 postpublished an instruction prefetching device is for use in carrying out prefetch of an instruction sequence in a data processing system including an executing unit and comprises a branch history table. In the manner which will later be described more in detail, a plurality of entry pairs are memorized in the branch history table. Each entry pair comprises a first and a second entry. The first entry specifies an instruction address of a branch instruction which should be executed by the executing unit prior to prefetch of the instruction sequence. The second entry specifies branch information which comprises a branch destination address obtained by previous execution of the branch instruction. The second entry corresponds to the first entry in this manner as regards each branch instruction. On prefetching an instruction of the instruction sequence, the branch history table is retrieved in search of one of the first entries of the entry pairs in response to a current instruction address of the instruction being prefetched as a current instruction, If one of the first entries is located that specifies an instruction address coincident with the current instruction address, the branch history table produces a corresponding second entry. Prefetch of the instruction sequence is controlled in response to the corresponding second entry. According to the elder patent application, the loss cycle is only one machine cycle long on the average. The branch instruction may, however, be a branch count instruction which specifies one of a plurality of general purpose registers of the executing unit so as to administrate the number of times of repeated execution of instructions along a loop until a count becomes a predetermined number when the loop is eventually left. In this event, the loss cycle becomes long in the manner which will later become clear. It is therefore a general object of the present invention to provide an instruction prefetching device operable with only a short average loss cycle to prefetch an instruction sequence including a branch instruction even when the branch instruction is a branch count instruction. It is a specific object of this invention to provide an instruction prefetching device of the type described, which is capable of reducing the average loss cycle to only about one machine cycle. It is another specific object of this invention to provide an instruction prefetching device of the type described, by which it is possible to accurately prefetch an instruction sequence. These objects are solved with the features of the claims. Referring to Fig. 1, a data or information processing system comprises an instruction prefetching device according to a first embodiment of the present invention. Before describing the instruction prefetching device, an example of the data processing system will be described in order to facilitate an understanding of this invention. It is known in the art that a data processing system is divisible into a plurality of units as, for example, an instruction memory unit 31, an instruction address generating circuit 32, an instruction address translating circuit 33, an instruction executing circuit 35, an instruction decoding circuit 36, an operand address generating circuit 37, an operand address translating circuit 38, and an operand reading unit 39. The instruction memory unit 31 is for storing a plurality of instructions. The operand reading unit 39 includes an operant memory not shown . As the case may be, a combination of the instruction address generating circuit 32, the instruction address translating circuit 33, the instruction executing circuit 35, and the instruction decoding circuit 36, is called an instruction executing unit. Although not depicted, a main memory may be used in common as the instruction memory unit 31 and the operand memory of the operand reading unit 39. Address generating and translating units may be used in common to the instruction address generating circuit 32 and the operand address generating circuit 37 and to the instruction address translating circuit 33 and the operand address translating circuit 38. The data processing system may comprise several resources not shown . By way of example, the instruction memory unit 31 and the operand memory may comprise instruction and operand cache memories. Each cache memory gives a copy of a portion of the instruction memory unit 31 and the operand memory. Each of the instruction and the operand address translating circuits 33 and 38 may comprise an address translating buffer. If necessary, reference should be made as regards the instruction and the operand cache memories and as regards the instruction and the operand address translating circuits 33 and 38 to JP A 87,282 81. Referring to Fig. 2, it is possible to understand that each instruction is executed generally on eight following stages. Use of the above exemplified resources makes it possible to process the IT and the OT stages and the IC and the OC stages at a high speed. Furthermore, the data processing system is enabled to execute a sequence of instructions under an eight stage pipeline control. Referring to Fig. 3, it will be assumed that the data processing system executes a sequence of instructions A0, BC, A1, A2, A3, A4, ..., B1, B2, B3, B4, and so forth. In the instruction sequence, a branch condition instruction A0 is immediately followed by a branch instruction BC. It is to be noted here that a branch instruction BC is not a branch count instruction described heretobefore unless specifically so called and denoted by BCT. In compliance with a branch condition which becomes evident by execution of the branch condition instruction A0, the branch instruction BC indicates either of two branch directions, in which a stream of execution of the instruction sequence proceeds to a first partial sequence of instructions A1 and so on and to a second partial sequence of instructions B1 and the like, respectively. It should be noted that the first partial sequence next follows the branch instruction BC in the instruction sequence and that the second partial sequence follows the first partial sequence. The second partial sequence may alternatively be called a branch. When the branch condition indicates no go to the branch, the first partial sequence is prefetched prior to prefetch of the second partial sequence. When the branch condition indicates go to the branch, the second partial sequence is prefetched before the first partial sequence. The first partial sequence is said to be on a no go to branch side and the second partial sequence, on a go to branch side. The instruction A1 or B1 which stands foremost in each partial sequence, is called a branch destination or target instruction depending on the branch condition. It will now be presumed that the eight above described stages IA through EX are dealt with under the eight stage pipeline control for the instruction sequence being exemplified. If the IA through the EX stages are carried out for the branch condition instruction A0 at zeroth through seventh instants t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, and t7, respectively, the IA through the ID stages are carried out for the branch instruction BC at the first through the fourth instants t1 to t4, respectively. Two adjacent instants, such as t0 and t1, are spaced apart by one machine cycle. According to prior art, such an instruction sequence is prefetched with a branch prediction or presumption such that the branch condition always indicates go to the branch. In this event, the prediction for the go to branch side becomes known when the branch instruction BC is actually decoded at the fourth instant t4. In the meanwhile, the IA stage is carried out at the second through the fourth instants t2 to t4 for prefetch of those three instructions A1 through A3, respectively, which are on the no go to branch side. As indicated in Fig. 2 by a line 40 with an arrowhead, the ID stage is carried out at the fourth instant t4 on the branch instruction BC and is followed by the IA stage carried out thereon at the fifth instant t5 to give an instruction address of the branch destination instruction B1 in compliance with the prediction for go to the branch. The instruction address of a branch destination instruction on that one of the no go and the go to branch sides to which the stream shoud flow, is herein called a branch destination or target address. The IA stage is carried out at the sixth and the seventh instants t6 and t7 for prefetch of those two more instructions B2 and B3, respectively, which are on the go to branch side. At the seventh instant t7, the branch condition is rendered evident by a result of the EX stage of the branch condition instruction A0 in the manner described hereinabove. It is now possible to evaluete or confirm whether the prediction for the go to branch side has really been correct or incorrect. If the prediction is correct or successful, the instructions B1 and others are prefetched. If the prediction fails, namely, if the prediction is incorrect or unsuccessful, the instructions A1 and so forth are prefetched. At an eighth instant t8 and thereafter, the instruction sequence is prefetched along a proper or pertinent stream either for the instruction A4 or for the instruction B4. The branch prediction may always be to the no go to branch side rather than towards the go to branch side in the manner thus far been described. In either event, a loss cycle of three machine cycles is unavoidable irrespective of correctness and failure of the prediction whenever a branch instruction appears in the instruction sequence. Turning to Fig. 4, an instruction sequence of the type being exemplified, is prefetched as follows by an improved instruction prefetching device disclosed in the above cited JP A 76,638 82, prediction is carried out for each branch instruction by reference to a branch pointer flag indicative of either of the no go and the go to branch sides based on prior results of actual execution of the branch instruction in question. In the manner described before in conjunction with Fig. 3, the IA stage is carried out at the zeroth through the fourth instants t0 to t4 for prefetch of the branch condition instruction A0, the branch instruction BC, and the three instructions A1 through A3 on the no go to branch side, respectively. Concurrently with the IA stage for the instruction A3, the ID stage is carried out for the branch instruction BC at the fourth instant t4. Decision is thereby given whether the process should proceed to the no go to branch side or to the go to branch side. Depending on the decision, the IA stage is carried out at the fifth through the seventh instants t5 to t7 either for prefetch of three instructions A4, A5, and A6 on the no go to branch side or for prefetch of three instructions B1, B2, and B3 on the go to branch side. The branch condition becomes evident at the seventh instant t7 as a result of execution of the branch condition instruction A0. If the no go to branch side is predicted at the fourth instant t4 and found to be really correct at the seventh instant t7, the IA stage is carried out at the eighth instant t8 for prefetch of the instruction A7 which next follows on the no go to branch side. If the prediction is also no go to branch and is decided to be incorrect, the IA stage is carried out at the eighth instant t8 for prefetch of the foremost instruction B1 on the go to branch side. If the prediction is go to the branch and is correct, the IA stage is carried out at the eighth instant t8 for prefetch of the instruction B4 which next follows the instruction B3 on the go to branch side. If the prediction is go to the branch and is incorrect, the IA stage is carried out at the eighth instant t8 for prefetch of the instruction A4 which is next subsequent to the instruction A3 on the no go to branch side. At any rate, the instruction sequence is prefetched along a proper stream at the eighth instant t8 and later. The loss cycle is three machine cycles long if the prediction is go to the branch and is either correct or incorrect, nil if the prediction is no go to the branch and is correct, and six machine cycles long if the prediction is no go to the branch and fails. A degree α of correctness of the prediction, namely, the probability that the prediction is correct, is appreciably high because the prediction is based on prior results. It has been confirmed that the degree α is about 0.8. It is possible to surmise that go to the branch and no go to the branch occurs at a rate of fifty to fifty. In other words, each of go and no go to the branch occurs at a probalility γ of 0.5. Under the circumstances, an average loss cycle of Referring back to Fig. 1, the data processing system comprises an instruction address register 41 in which request addresses are set one at a time as a current request address IAR through a request address selector 42 as will later be described in detail. Accessed by the current request address, the instruction memory unit 31 produces a block of an instruction word as a current instruction. It will be assumed merely for convenience of description that the instruction word produced in response to each request, is eight bytes long. Turning to Fig. 5, an instruction word usually consists of a plurality of instructions. The illustrated instruction word consists of four two byte instructions BC0, A, BC1, and BC2. In the manner which will presently become clear, the instructions may have different instruction code lengths. Turning back to Fig. 1, the instruction words are successively read out of the instruction memory unit 31 and are temporarily stored in an instruction buffer 43 as a queue. An instruction aligner 44 is for delivering the instruction words one by one from the instruction buffer 43 to the instruction decoding circuit 36. Only when the instruction buffer 43 is empty, the instruction aligner 44 supplies the instruction decoding circuit 36 with the instruction word currently read out of the instruction memory unit 31. A request address adder 45 is for adding eight to the current request address supplied from the instruction address register 41 to provide a next request address. When selected by the request address selector 42 in the manner which will later be described, the next request address is substituted as a new current request address in the instruction address register 41 for the previous current request address so as to prefetch a next subsequent instruction word from the instruction memory unit 31 as a new current instruction. According to the embodiment being illustrated, the instruction prefetching device comprises a branch history table 46. In the manner which will shortly be described in detail, the branch history table 46 is retrieved by the current request address supplied from the instruction address register 41 to produce branch information in general if the instruction word currently read out of the instruction memory unit 31 comprises a branch instruction which may be either of a branch count instruction and a branch instruction other than the branch count instruction. Turning to Fig. 6, the branch history table 46 is for memorizing a plurality of entry pairs. Each entry pair consists of a first or address entry AA and a second or data entry DA for each branch instruction which has ever been executed. The first and the second entries of each pair therefore correspond to each other. The first entry AA is address information which specifies an instruction address of the branch instruction under consideration as a branch instruction address. The second entry DA is the above mentioned branch information and comprises a branch destination adderss which has ever been obtained by actual execution of the branch instruction in question. When the current request address comprises a branch instruction address specified by one of the first entries, the branch history table 46 produces the branch information of the corresponding second entry. The second entry corresponding to the above mentioned one of the first entries, specifies the branch destination address as a predicted branch destination address. When the current request address comprises a branch instruction address specified by none of the first entries, the current request address is dealt with as if not including a branch instruction address even though the current instruction word may comprise a branch instruction. Such a branch instruction is treated in this event as though indicative of no go to the branch irrespective of the branch direction indicated by that branch instruction. It is preferred that the first entry AA indicates a real address of the branch instruction. It will be presumed that a first and a second part of the real instruction address is given by fourth through seventeenth bits and twenty ninth and thirtieth bits of the request address IAR 4 17 and IAR 29, 30 , respectively. Preferably, the branch destination address be also a real address. It is also preferred that the branch information further comprises a validity flag V which indicates validity of the branch information and, at the same time, the branch direction. For example, the validity flag V is a one bit flag. A binary one validity flag indicates go to the branch and the validity of branch information. A binary zero validity bit indicates no go to the branch and that the branch information is void. It is to be noted in connection with Fig, 6 that the validity flag or bit V is depicted contiguous to the real branch instruction address as if a part of the first entry AA rather than contiguous to the real branch destination address as a part of the second entry DA. This is merely for convenience of description as will later become clear. In Fig. 1, the branch history table 46 furthermore produces in the manner later described an address hit signal indicative of whether or not the current request address used for retrieval, comprises a branch instruction address specified by one of the first entries. The address hit signal is delivered to an instruction prefetch control unit 47 as one of three input signals thereof. It is possible to understand as will later become clear that the address hit signal serves as a predicted branch direction signal indicative of either of the no go and the go to branch side as a predicted branch direction. In the embodiment being illustrated, a branch information buffer 48 has an address information and a branch information field partitioned in Fig. 1 by a thin vertical line. Concurrently with accumulation of the instruction words in the instruction buffer 43 in response to successive request addresses, branch instruction addresses included in the successive request addresses are successively delivered from the instruction address register 41 and are accumulated in the address information field of the branch information buffer 48. The branch information produced by the branch history table 46 in response to each branch instruction address, is accumulated in the branch information field of the branch information buffer 48. A branch information switch 49 corresponds to the instruction aligner 44. Turning to Fig. 7, a sequence of instructions is exemplified wherein first through n th instructiions A1 to An are followed by a branch count instruction BCT and then by another instruction B1. Due to the branch count instruction BCT which indicates go to the branch unless a count reaches the predetermined number described heretobefore, a partial sequence of the first through the n th instructions A1 to An and the branch count instruction BCT serves as a branch. The branch count instruction BCT indicates in general the first instruction A1 as a branch destination instruction. A loop of the first through the n th instructions A1 to An and the branch count instruction BCT is repeatedly executed. As soon as the count reaches the predetermined number, the branch count instruction indicates leave of the loop, namely, the no go to branch side. The other instruction B1 is indicated as another branch destination instruction. It is already described in conjunction with Fig. 4 that the average loss cycle is 2.1 machine cycles long according to the Smith patent application and will later be described that the use of the branch history table 46 and the related circuitry makes it possible to shorten the average loss cycle to only one machine cycle if the branch instruction is not a branch count instruction BCT. The average loss cycle, however, becomes longer when the branch instruction is a branch count instruction BCT. In the above described ID stage, the instruction decoding circuit 36 Fig. 1 produces a BCT bit which may be logic one and zero when the current instruction is a branch count instruction BCT and is not, respectively. Further turning to Fig. 8, it will be surmised in the following that the branch information includes the validity bit V in the manner described above. The branch information stored in the branch information buffer 48, comprises in this event the predicted branch destination address and the validity bit V. Although depicted in Fig. 8, the BCT bit and an instruction code length are not memorised in the branch history table 46 and are therefore not stored in the branch information buffer 48. Again in Fig. 1, a first branch information register 51 has an address and a branch information field like the branch information buffer 48. Similarly, each of second and third branch information registers 52 and 53 has an address and a branch information field. The address information field of each of the second and the third branch information registers 52 and 53 is for the instruction code length and the branch instruction address. The branch information field is depicted in Fig. 8 in two parts, one for the BCT bit and the other for the predicted branch destination address and the validity bit V. It will now be assumed that the current instruction is a branch instruction which may or may not be a branch count instruction BCT. As noted before, the branch instruction will be denoted by BC if different from the branch count instruction BCT. The branch information switch 49 delivers the branch instruction address and the branch information of the branch information buffer 48 to the address and the branch information fields of the first branch information register 51 as a content thereof simultaneously with delivery of each instruction word from the instruction buffer 43 to the instruction decoding circuit 36. Only when the instruction buffer 43 and consequently the branch information buffer 48 is empty, the branch information switch 49 transfers the branch instruction address and the branch information to the first branch information register 51 directly from the instruction address register 41 and the branch history table 46, respectively. It is to be noted in this connection that when the instruction decoding circuit 36 is supplied either directly with the instruction word read out of the instruction memory unit 31 in response to a request address or indirectly through the instruction buffer 43, the first branch information register 51 is supplied with the branch instruction address and the branch information produced by the branch history table 46 in response to the request address in question. The instruction word and the branch instruction address will therefore be referred to afresh as a current instruction and a current instruction address, respectively. When the current instruction is subjected to the ID stage, the content of the first branch information register 51 is moved to the second branch information register 52. The BCT bit and the instruction code length are delivered from the instruction decoding circuit 36 to the second branch information register 52. The BCT bit, the instruction code length, and the content of the first branch information register 51 are stored in the second information register 52 as a content thereof. Upon subjection of the current instruction to the IT stage, the content of the second branch information register 51 is transferred to the third branch information register 53. Referring to Fig. 9, the instruction decoding circuit 36 comprises an instruction register 56 in which each instruction is stored by the instruction aligner 44 Fig. 1 . For the time being, the instruction may neither be a branch count instruction nor a branch instruction other than the branch count instruction. In the manner known in the art, the instruction register 56 has operation code OP , R, X, B, and displacement DISP fields. The operation code stored in the operation code field, is decoded by an operation code decoter 57 to indicate operation of the instruction executing circuit 35 through a connection which is not depicted in Fig. 1. The R and the X fields of the instruction are delivered also to the instruction executing circuit 35 through like connections. The BCT bit is produced by the operation code decoder 57 and stored in the second branch information register 52 in the manner described above. The instruction code length is produced also by the operation code decoder 57 and stored in the second branch information register 52. It is possible to understand that the operation code decoter 57 is included in the instruction prefetching device and serves to discrimination between a branch count instruction BCT and a branch instruction other than the branch count instruction BCT. An index register unit XR 58 and a base register unit BR 59 are software visible registers in which results of execution of the instruction are stored from the instruction executing circuit 35 through connections not shown in Fig. 1. The index and the base register units 58 and 59 are searched by the X and the B fields. In Fig. 9, the operand address generating unit 37 is operative when the instruction register 56 is loaded with an instruction which requires an operand. Values searched from the index and the base register units 58 and 59 and the displacement field of the instruction are stored in registers 61, 62, and 63, respectively. An adder 64 is for calculating a sum of outputs of the respective registers 61 through 63 to feed a logical address of the operand to the operand address translating circuit 38. Referring back to Fig. 1 again, an actual branch information register 65 has an address and a branch information field like the second and the third branch information registers 52 and 53. It will now be assumed that the current instruction delivered to the instruction address generating circuit 32 is a branch instruction indicative of go to the branch. The branch instruction may be a branch count instruction unless the branch count instruction indicates leave of a loop but repeated execution of the loop. The instruction address generating circuit 32 delivers a logical branch destination address to the instruction address translating circuit 33, which thereupon supplies a prediction evaluating or confirming circuit 66 and a part of the branch information field of the actual branch information register 65 with an actual branch destination address signal indicative of an actual branch destination address obtained by execution of the current branch instruction. Concurrently, the BCT bit, the instruction code length, the current branch instruction address, and the validity bit V are moved from the third branch information register 53 to another part of the branch information field, the address information field, and still another part of the branch information field of the actual branch information register 65. Executing a branch instruction in compliance with the indication given from the operation code decoder 57 Fig. 9 , the instruction executing circuit 35 produces an actual branch direction signal indicative of an actual branch direction, namely, whether the stream of execution should have been directed to the no go to branch side or is actually directed to the go to branch side. The instruction executing circuit 35 capable of producing such a branch direction signal, will briefly be described later in the following and may be that described in US A 3,825,895. An instruction address adder 67 is fed from the address information field of the actual branch information register 65 with the current branch instruction address and the instruction code length of the current branch instruction to provide a next instruction address for an instruction which next follows the current branch instruction in the instruction sequence. An instruction address selector 69 is controlled by the actual branch direction signal to select the next instruction address and the actual branch destination address as a selected instruction address when the actual branch direction signal indicates the no go and the go to branch sides, respectively. The selected instruction address is delivered to the request address selector 42 and stored in a selected destination address register 71 as a selected destination address, which is delivered thence to the request address selector 42 and to the branch history table 46. The current branch instruction address is fed also to the request address selector 42 directly from the actual branch information register 65. It has already been described in connection with the second and the third branch information registers 52 and 53 that the branch information comprises the BCT bit, the predicted branch destination address, and the validity bit V. The prediction evaluating circuit 66 is supplied also with the actual branch direction signal from the instruction executing circuit 35, the predicted branch destination address and the validity bit V from the third branch information register 53, and the BCT bit from the actual branch information register 65. It is possible to understand that a combination of the actual branch destination address signal of the instruction address translating circuit 33 and the actual branch direction signal of the instruction executing circuit 35 gives a result of actual execution of the current branch instruction which is under execution by the instruction executing unit. It will become clear as the description proceeds that the prediction evaluating circuit 66 evaluates the branch information and the BCT bit in consideration of the result of actual execution and produces a branch evaluation signal BE and a prediction evaluation signal PE. The branch evaluation signal BE is delivered to the prefetch control unit 47 as another of the three input signals and indicates whether a loop should be repeatedly executed or should be left. For a branch count instruction BCT which generally predicts go to the branch with the actual and the predicted branch destination addresses rendered coincident with each other so as to repeatedly execute a loop, the branch evaluation signal BE of the logic one level represents the fact that the actual branch direction signal is produced by the instruction executing unit 35 with the logic zero level to indicate leave of the loop. The prediction evaluation signal PE is fed to the prefetch control unit 47 as still another of the three input signals and to a write pulse flip flop 72. The prediction evaluation signal PE indicates with the logic zero and one levels correctness and incorrectness of the prediction, respectively. In other words, the prediction evaluation signal PE of the logic zero and one levels indicates that the predicted branch direction and the predicted branch destination address are corrent and incorrect, respectively, in view of the respective ones of the actual branch direction and the actual branch destination address which become evident by the result of actual execution. When indicative of failure or incorrectness of the prediction, the write pulse flip flop 72 delivers a write pulse to the branch history table 46, holding the prediction evaluation signal PE of the logic one level during one machine cycle. When selected by the request address selector 42 in the manner which will become clear as the description proceeds, either the selected instruction address of the instruction address selector 69 is used for prefetch of an instruction next subsequent to the current branch instruction in the stream of execution. When selected by the request address selector 42, the current branch instruction address is used in accessing the branch history table 46 for renewal or updating of the branch information in response to the write pulse and with reference to the actual branch destination address which is selected by the instruction address selector 69, stored in the selected destination address register 71 as the selected destination address, and delivered to the request address selector 42. It is general that branch instructions are included only here and there in an instruction sequence. The address hit signal therefore ordinarily indicates absence in the branch history table 46 of the address information which specifies a branch instruction address. Responsive to the address hit signal indicative of the absence, the prefetch control unit 47 makes the request address selector 42 select the next request address supplied from the request address adder 45. If the address hit signal indicates presence in the branch history table 46 of the address information which specifies the instruction address of a branch instruction, the branch instruction is either a branch count instruction BCT or a branch instruction other than the branch count instruction. Discriminatin therebetween is possible by the BCT bit. The branch count instruction BCT may indicate leave of a loop, which fact is indicated by the branch evaluation signal BE. It will be assumed that the predicted branch direction is coincident with the actual branch direction and that the predicted branch destination address is also coincident with the actual branch destination address. The prefetch control unit 47 is informed of the facts by the prediction evaluation signal PE. When the branch instruction is not a branch count instruction BCT, the prefetch control unit 47 makes the request address selector 42 select the predicted branch destination address supplied from the branch history table 46. Also when a branch count instruction BCT indicates go to the branch, namely, repeated execution of a loop, the prefetch control unit 47 makes the request address selector 42 select the predicted branch destination address supplied from the branch history table 46. Prefetch proceeds to the branch destination instruction on the go to branch side at once without waiting the result of decoding of the branch instruction which may or may not be a branch count instruction BCT. It will now be assumed that the predicted branch direction is incoincident with the actual branch directior or that the predicted branch destination address is incoincident with the actual branch destination address despite coincidence between the predicted and the actual branch directions. The prefetch control unit 47 is informed of either fact by the prediction evaluation signal PE. It is to be noted that the predicted and the actual branch directions are incoincident with each other when the branch count instruction BCT indicates leave of the loop, namely, no go to the branch. A selected destination address is set in the selected destination address register 71 irrespective of the prediction evaluation signal PE. When the actual branch direction is no go to the branch, the instruction address selector 69 selects that next instruction address as the selected instruction address which is calculated by the instruction address adder 67. The prefetch control unit 47 makes the request address selector 42 select the next instruction address for prefetch of the instruction which next follows the current branch instruction in the instruction sequence. If the branch instruction is not a branch count instruction BCT in this event, the prefetch control unit 47 makes the request address selector 42 select one machine cycle later the current branch instruction address which is supplied directly from the actual branch information selector 65. The write pulse resets the validity bit V of the branch information which corresponds in the branch history table 46 to the address information indicative of the branch instruction address under consideration. If the branch instruction is a branch count instruction BCT, the branch history table 46 is left untouched. When the actual branch direction is towards the go to branch side, the instruction address selector 69 selects the actual branch destination address from the actual branch information register 65 as the selected instruction address. If the branch instruction is not a branch count instruction BCT, the prefetch control unit 47 makes the request address selector 42 select one machine cycle later the current branch instruction address of the actual branch information register 65. The write pulse substitutes the actual branch destination address in the branch history table 46 for the existing branch destination address specified by the branch information which corresponds to the address information indicative of the branch instruction address in question. Immediately thereafter, the prefetch proceeds in accordance with the updated branch information. If the branch instruction is a branch count instruction BCT, the prefetch control unit 47 makes the request address selector 42 select the selected instruction address supplied directly from the instruction address selector 69. The prefetch proceeds in accordance with the selected instruction address. The write pulse is, howver, not produced to renew the branch history table 46. Referring to Fig. 10, prefetch of the instruction sequence exemplified in Figs. 3 and 4 is carried out by the instruction prefetching device described in conjunction with Fig. 1 in a case where correctness of the prediction is indicated to the prefetch control unit 47 by the prediction evaluation signal PE produced by the prediction evaluating circuit 66 for a branch instruction BC which is not a branch count instruction BCT. Attention will now be directed only to the IC and the following stages, assuming that the IC through the EX stages are carried out for the branch condition instruction A0 at the zeroth through the fifth instants t0 to t5, respectively. At the IC stage carried out for each instruction, the current request address is used as usual in reading the instruction from the instruction memory unit 31. At the same time, the request address is used in retrieving the branch history table 46. At the first instant t1, the branch instruction BC is read out of the instruction memory unit 31. The branch history table 46 produces the address hit signal and the branch information which specifies a branch destination address as a predicted branch destination address. When the address hit signal indicates no go to the branch as the predicted branch direction, the IC stage is carried out at the second, third, and subsequent instants t2, t3, and so forth for the instructions A1, A2, and so on which are on the no go to branch side. When the address hit signal indicates go to the branch, the IC stage is carried out at the second, third, and following instants t2, t3, and others for the instructions B1 and so forth which are on the go to branch side. The EX stage is carried out for the branch condition instruction A0 at the fifth instant t5. Inasmuch as the prediction is correct in the case being described, prefetch proceeds in the predicted branch direction at the sixth instant t6 and after either for the instruction A5 and the like or the instruction B5 and others without any disturbance to the stream of prefetch operation. Turning to Fig. 11, it will now be assumed that failure of the prediction is indicated by the prediction evaluation signal PE. In the manner described with reference to Fig. 10, prefetch proceeds at the second through the fifth instants t2 to t5 for the instructions A1 through A4 and for the instructions B1 through B4 when the prediction is no go and go to the branch, respectively. At the fifth instant t5, the prediction is decided to be incorrect as a result of the EX stage carried out for the branch condition instruction A0. At the sixth instant t6, the branch history table 46 is updated or renewed as indicated along the line for the branch instruction BC by HU history table update . At the seventh instant t7, the IC stage is carried out afresh either for the foremost instruction B1 on the go to branch side or for the instruction A1 on the go to branch side along a proper stream of instruction execution. Reviewing Figs. 10 and 11, the loss cycle is nil if the prediction is correct. The loss cycle is five machine cycles long if the prediction fails. Inasmuch as the prediction is carried out not only for the branch direction but also for the branch destination address, the degree α of correctness of the prediction is somewhat smaller than that for the case of the Smith patent application described with reference to Fig. 4. The decrease is, however, trivial and the degree α may again be about 0.8. The average loss cycle for each branch instruction is Further turning to Fig. 12, it will be assumed that the branch instruction is a branch count instruction BCT and that the branch count instruction BCT indicates leave of a loop, namely, the actual branch direction is no go to the branch despite the predicted branch direction of go to the branch. Even in this event, the branch history table 46 is left untouched at the sixth instant t6. The loss cycle is therefore four machine cycles long despite the fact that the branch evaluation signal BE indicates incorrectness of the predicted branch direction. Before indication of leave of the loop by the branch count instruction BCT, the loop is executed without a loss cycle by the branch information indicative of go to the branch. Unless the branch count instruction BCT is discriminated from other branch instructions, five machine cycles are lost in renewing the branch history table 46 upon leave of the loop. On again entering the loop, five machine cycles are also lost in again renewing the branch history table 46. With the instruction prefetching device being illustrated, the loop is again entered without the loss cycle because the branch history table 46 is not renewed on previously leaving the loop. Once again in Fig. 1, the request address adder 45 would calculate the sum for the real address. In a data processing system which carries out paging, the next request address may therefore become over or beyond the page being referred to. In this case of the page over, the IT stage must be carried out anew. Under the circumstances, the request address adder 45 should comprise a detector not shown for detecting the page over to produce a page over signal upon detection of the page over. The page over signal is delivered to the instruction address generating circuit 32 to again start the process from the IA stage. Turning to Fig. 13, the instruction address generating circuit 32 comprises first through third registers 76, 77, and 78 which are loaded with the values searched from the index and the base register units 58 and 59 Fig. 9 and with the displacement given from the displacement field of the instruction register 56, respectively. An adder 79 is for calculating a sum of outputs of the respective registers 76 through 78 to produce a logical instruction address. When a branch information is stored in the instruction register 56 as a current branch instruction, the logical instruction address is a logical branch destination address for the current branch instruction. The branch instruction may be a branch count instruction BCT. An instruction counter 81 is for indicating a next logical address of a subsequent instruction which should be executed subsequent to the current instruction. For this purpose, the instruction counter 81 is updated through a connection not shown in Fig. 1 by a result of execution carried out for the current instruction by the instruction executing circuit 35. An OR circuit 82 is for producing an OR output signal in response to either of the page over signal and an initial start signal supplied from outside of the data processing system being illustrated. Responsive to the OR output signal, a logical address selector 83 selects the next logical address to deliver the same to the instruction address translating circuit 33 for prefetch of the subsequent instruction. Otherwise, the logical address selector 83 supplies the instruction address translating circuit 33 with the logical address calculated by the adder 79. Referring now to Fig. 14, the branch history table 46 may comprise a directory memory 86 and a data memory 87. Each memory 86 or 87 is an m set n level memory, where each of It will be assumed in the following that the levels are four in number as usual. First through fourth levels of the directory memory 86 will be designated by AA1 through AA4. The directory memory levels AAi s First through fourth test circuits 911, 912, 913, and 914 or 91i s are associated with the first through the fourth directory memory levels AAi s, respectively. Each test circuit 91i is supplied with the first and the second real address parts IAR 4 17 and IAR 29, 30 of the current request address IAR and is for testing presence and absence of the current branch instruction address in the associated directory memory level AAi. The test circuit 91i produces an i th partial hit signal which takes logic one and zero levels in the presence and the absence of the current branch instruction address, respectively. Responsive to the partial hit signal, an OR circuit 92 delivers the above described address hit signal to the instruction prefetch control unit 47. The partial hit signals produced by the respective test circuits 91i s are delivered to a priority circuit 93 for the purpose which will shortly become clear. Turning to Fig. 15, it will be assumed that the validity bit V is memorized in the directory memory level AAi. Each test circuit 91i may comprise a coincidence circuit 96 for detecting coincidence and incoincidence between the first real address part IAR 4 17 of the current request address and a first real address part IAR 4 17 fed from the associated directory memory level AAi to produce a coincidence signal which takes the logic one and zero levels upon detection of the coincidence and the incoincidence, respectively. A comparator 97 is for comparing the second real address part IAR 29, 30 of the current request address with a second real address part IAR 29, 30 supplied from the associated directory memory level AAi to produce a comparison result signal which takes the logic one and zero levels when the second real address part of the current request address is not less and is less than the second real address part delivered from the associated directory memory level AAi, respectively. The coincidence signal and the comparison result signal are supplied to an AND circuit 98 together with the validity bit V to become the partial hit signal. The coincidence signal of the logic one level indicates that the associated directory memory level AAi is loaded with an entry which specifies a branch instruction address of a branch instruction comprised by an eight byte instruction word accessed by the current request address. The logic one coincidence signal is, however, insufficient to establish correspondence between the current request address and a branch instruction which should thereby be prefetched. Attention will be directed to the instruction word exemplified in Fig. 5. Let the instructions BC0, BC1, and BC2 be branch instructions indicative of go to the branch and the instruction A, an instruction other than branch instructions. If another preceding branch instruction not shown indicates the instruction A of an instruction address A labelled in Fig. 5 as a branch destination instruction, a request address set in the instruction address register 41 includes the address A . In this event, the instruction which should be prefetched next subsequent to the instruction A in the stream of execution, should not be the branch instruction BC2 but the branch instruction BC1 which next follows the instruction A in the instruction sequence. In Fig. 15, the comparator 97 and the AND circuit 98 are for correctly producing the partial hit signal. Logic one partial hit signals are, however, produced under the circumstances by the test circuits 91i s which are associated with the directory memory levels AAi s loaded with entries for the branch instructions BC1 and BC2. The priority circuit 93 is for selecting only one partial hit signal for the branch instruction BC1. Further turning to Fig. 16, the priority circuit 93 may comprise first through fourth AND circuit groups 1111, 1112, ..., and 1114 or 111i s which receive the partial hit signals from the respective test circuits 91i s and are associated with the respective directory memory levels AAi s through connections not illustrated in Figs. 14 and 15. In the manner depicted in the first AND circuit group 1111 in detail, each AND circuit group 111i comprises first through fourth AND circuits 1121, 1122, 1123, and 1124 or 112j s supplied in common with the pertinent one of the partial hit signals which are now designated by HIT1 through HIT4 for the test circuits 911 through 914, respectively. As indicated by AAi1 through AAi4, the AND circuits 112j s are supplied with the second real address part IAR 29, 30 which is produced by the associated directory memory level AAi and indicates 0 through 3, respectively. The first through the fourth AND circuits 112j s produce first through fourth AND outputs 1131, 1132, 1133, and 1134 or 113j s which take the logic one level according to HITi.AAij s. Otherwise, the AND outputs 113j have the logic zero level. The first through the fourth AND outputs 113j s of each AND circuit group 111i are delivered to first through fourth four input OR circuits 1141, 1142, 1143, and 1144 or 114j s, respectively. The OR circuits 114j s produce first through fourth selection signals V1, V2, V3, and V4, respectively. The first selection signal V1 takes the logic one level when at least one of the first AND outputs 1131 s of the respective AND circuit groups 111i s is of the logic one level. The second selection signal V2 takes the logic one level when the first selection signal V1 does not take the logic one level and when at least one of the second AND outputs 1132 s of the respective AND circuit groups 111i s takes the logic one level. The third selection signal V3 takes the logic one level when none of the first and the second selection signals V1 and V2 takes the logic one level and when at least one of the third AND outputs 1133 s of the respective AND circuit groups 111i s is of the logic one level. The fourth selection signal V4 takes the logic one level when none of the first through the third selection signals V1 to V3 is of the logic one level and when at least one of the fourth AND outputs 1134 s of the respective AND circuit groups 111i s takes the logic one level. Otherwise, the selection signals V1 through V4 have the logic zero level. Turning back to Fig. 14, the branch history table 46 comprises a level selector 119 connected to the levels of the data memory 87 and supplied with the first through the fourth selection signals V1 to V4 from the priority circuit 93. In the example described with reference to Figs. 5 and 14, two of the data memory levels produce the branch information which specifies the branch destination addresses of the branch instructions BC1 and BC2. The selection signal of the logic one level selects the branch information for the pertinent branch instruction BC1 alone. It is thereby possible to establish the correspondence between the branch information produced by the branch history table 46 and the current instruction produced in response to the current request address. Reviewing Figs. 14 through 16, the branch history table 46 is retrieved at first by the set address given by the current request address. If it happens that a plurality of branch instruction addresses are specified by the address information memorized in one of the sets accessed by the set address, the priority circuit 93 is used to pick up one of the branch instruction addresses as a picked up instruction address that is for a branch instruction, such as BC1, which should be prefetched next subsequent to the current instruction. The level selector 119 selects the branch information which comprises the branch destination address obtained by prior execution of the branch instruction in question and therefore corresponds to the picked up instruction address. It will now be appreciated that the prefetch accurately and rapidly proceeds even in the presence of a plurality of branch instructions in a block of an instruction word. Referring to Fig. 17, the prediction evaluating circuit 66 may comprise a coincidence circuit 121 for detecting coincidence and incoincidence between the actual branch destination address supplied from the instruction address translating circuit 33 and the predicted branch destination address fed from the branch information field of the third branch information register 53. The coincidence circuit 121 supplies a flip flop 122 with a coincidence signal which takes the logic one and zero levels upon detection of the coincidence and the incoincidence, respectively. Another flip flop 123 is supplied with the validity bit V from the branch information field of the third branch information register 53. Each of the flip flops 122 and 123 is for holding an input signal supplied thereto during one machine cycle to produce an output signal when a result of actual execution is obtained by the instruction executing circuit 35 for a current instruction for which the predicted and the actual branch destination addresses are delivered to the prediction evaluating circuit 66 together with the validity bit V. A BCT bit true false single input AND NAND circuit 126 is supplied with the BCT bit from the actual branch information register 65 to which the BCT bit is moved from the second branch information register 52 through the third branch information register 53 concurrently with production of the result of actual execution. The BCT bit true false circuit 126 produces an inverted BCT bit and the BCT bit as it stands. An actual branch direction true false circuit 127 is supplied with the actual branch direction signal from the instruction executing circuit 35. The actual branch direction signal and an inverted actual branch direction signal are produced by the actual branch direction true false circuit 127. A validity bit true false circuit 128 is supplied with the validity bit V from the flip flop 123. The validity bit true false circuit 128 produces the validity bit V and an inverted validity bit The BCT bit takes the logic one and zero levels for a branch count instruction BCT and an instruction other than a branch count instruction, respectively. The instruction other than a branch count instruction BCT may now be referred to as a general instruction and may be a branch instruction which is not a branch count instruction BCT and may now be called a general branch instruction. The inverted BCT bit takes the logic one and zero levels for a general instruction and a branch count instruction BCT, respectively. The inverted actual branch direction signal has the logic one and zero levels when the actual branch direction is towards the no go and the go to branch sides, respectively. The inverted actual branch direction signal therefore has the logic one and zero levels when the branch count instruction BCT indicates leave of a loop and repeated execution of the loop, respectively. The inverted validity bit is of the logic one and zero levels when the predicted branch direction is towards the no go and the go to branch sides, respectively. The inverted coincidence signal is equivalent to the coincidence signal indicative of the incoincidence and is of the logic one and zero levels when the predicted branch destination address is incoincident and coincident with the actual branch destination address, respectively. A first AND circuit 131 is for producing the branch evaluation signal BE in response to the BCT bit delivered from the BCT bit true false circuit 126, the inverted actual branch direction signal, the validity bit supplied from the validity bit true false circuit 128, and the coincidence signal delivered from the coincidence true false circuit 129. The branch evaluation signal BE therefore has the logic one level when a branch count instruction BCT indicates leave of a loop, namely, when the actual and the predicted branch directions become incoincident and moreover when the actual and the predicted branch destination addresses are coincident with each other. In other cases, the branch evaluation signal BE has the logic zero level. A second AND circuit 132 is for producing a no go prediction failure signal in response to the inverted BCT bit, the actual branch direction signal supplied from the actual branch direction true false circuit 127, and the inverted validity bit. The no go prediction failure signal takes the logic one level for a general branch instruction when the predicted branch direction is no go to the branch and furthermore when the actual branch direction is go to the branch. Otherwise, the no go prediction failure signal takes the logic zero level. A third AND circuit 133 is for producing a go failure signal in response to the inverted BCT bit, the inverted actual branch direction signal, the validity bit supplied from the validity bit true false circuit 128, and the coincidence signal fed from the coincidence true false circuit 129. The go failure signal has the logic one level for a general branch instruction when the predicted branch direction is go to the branch and furthermore when the actual branch direction is no go to the branch despite the fact that the predicted branch destination address is coincident with the actual branch destination address. Otherwise, the go prediction failure signal has the logic zero level. A fourth AND circuit 134 is for producing a predicted branch destination address failure signal in response to the inverted BCT bit, the validity bit supplied from the validity bit true false circuit 128, and the inverted coincidence signal. The address failure signal is of the logic one level for a general branch instruction when the predicted branch direction is go to the branch and furthermore when the predicted branch destination address is incoincident with the actual branch destination address. Otherwise, the address failure signal is of the logic zero level. A fifth AND circuit 135 is similar to the second AND circuit 132 except that the BCT bit is supplied from the BCT bit true false circuit 126 instead of the inverted BCT bit. The fifth AND circuit 135 therefore produces a no go prediction failure signal for a branch count instruction BCT. A sixth AND circuit 136 is like the fourth AND circuit 134 and produces a predicted branch destination address failure signal for a branch count instruction BCT. It will now be seen that the first AND circuit 131 corresponds to the third AND circuit 133 and that the branch evaluation signal BE is a go faiure signal for a branch count instruction BCT. A five input OR circuit 139 is for producing the prediction evaluation signal PE in response to the no go prediction failure signal, the go failure signal, and the predicted branch destination address failure signal for each general branch instruction and to the no go and the address failure signals for a branch count instruction BCT. The prediction evaluation signal PE therefore takes the logic one level either when prediction fails for a general branch instruction or when prediction fails for a branch count instruction BCT indicative of repeated execution of a loop. It is possible to understand that the branch evaluation signal BE has the logic one level when the branch count instruction BE indicates leave of a loop. Turning to Fig. 18, the instruction prefetch control unit 47 may comprise first through fourth true false circuits 141, 142, 143, and 144. A flip flop 146 is for holding the prediction evaluation signal PE for one machine cycle to produce a delayed prediction evaluation signal substantially simultaneously with production of the write pulse by the write pulse flip flop 72 Fig. 1 . The first true false circuit 141 is supplied with the address hit signal from the branch history table 46 to deliver the address hit signal to the request address selector 42 as a first selection signal. The second true false circuit 142 is supplied with the prediction evaluation signal PE directly from the prediction evaluating circuit 66 to deliver the prediction evaluation signal PE to the request address selector 42 as a second selection signal. The third true false circuit 143 is supplied with the delayed prediction evaluation signal to deliver the delayed prediction evaluation signal to the request address selector 42 as a third selection signal. The fourth true false circuit 144 is supplied with the branch evaluation signal BE from the prediction evaluating circuit 66 to deliver the branch evaluation signal BE to the request address selector 42 as a fourth selection signal. An inverted address hit signal, inverted prediction evaluation signals with and without the delay, and an inverted branch evaluation signal are delivered from the first through the fourth true false circuits 141 to 144, respectively, to a four input AND circuit 147, which feeds a fifth selection signal to the request address selector 42. When the address hit signal has the logic one level, the first selection signal takes the logic one level to make the request address selector 42 select the predicted branch destination address supplied from the branch history table 46. When the prediction evaluation signal PE turns to the logic one level, the second selection signal is given the logic one level to make the request address selector 42 select the current branch instruction address which is fed directly from the address information field of the actual branch information register 65. During one machine cycle which next follows turning of the prediction evaluation signal PE to the logic one level, the third selection signal is turned to the logic one level to make the request address selector 42 select the selected destination address which is held in the selected destination address register 71 and fed therefrom. When the branch evaluation signal BE is switched to the logic one level, the fourth selection signal is made to have the logic one level to make the request address selector 42 select the selected instruction address which is delivered directly from the instruction address selector 69. Whenever the address hit signal takes the logic one level, the AND circuit 147 is supplied from the first true false circuit 141 with its output turned to the logic zero level. The fifth selection signal is switched to the logic zero level. As soon as the prediction evaluation signal PE is turned to the logic one level, the AND circuit 147 is supplied from the second true false circuit 142 with its output given the logic zero level. One machine cycle immediately thereafter, the AND circuit 147 is supplied from the third true false circuit 143 with its output given the logic zero level. When the branch evaluation signal BE is turned to the logic one level, the AND circuit 147 is supplied from the fourth true false circuit 144 with its output given the logic zero level. The fifth selection signal therefore has the logic one level when the address hit signal is of the logic zero level except for one machine cycle immediately following turning of the branch evaluation signal BE to the logic one level and for two machine cycles immediately following turning of the prediction evaluation signal PE to the logic one level. The fifth selection signal of the logic one level is used in making the request address selector 42 select the next instruction address which is fed from the request address adder 45. Referring now to Fig. 19, the instruction memory unit 31 is for eight byte instruction words. Consideration will be given hereunder to an instruction sequence which comprises instructions A0, BC0, A1, A2, A3, A4, ..., B1, BC1, B2, B3, BC2, ..., C1, C2, and others in succession. The instructions BCk In correspondence to the instruction sequence memorized in the instruction memory unit 31, the directory memory 86 stores the address information which specifies the instruction addresses BC0 and BC2 of the branch instructions BC0 and BC2 indicative of go to the branch according to prior results of actual execution. The directory memory 86 furthermore stores, in accordance with prior results of actual execution, logic one validity bits indicative of go to the branch in correspondence to the branch instructions BC0 and BC2 and a logic zero validity bit indicative of no go to the branch in correspondence to the branch instruction BC1. The validity bits of the remaining branch information are rendered logic zero. The data memory 87 stores, for the branch instructions BC0 and BC2, the branch destination addresses B1 and C1 in compliance with prior results of actual execution of the branch instructions BC0 and BC2, respectively. If the branch instruction BC0 does not indicate go to the branch despite the predicted branch direction, the instruction A1 should be prefetched next subsequent to the branch instruction BC0. When the branch instruction BC1 actually indicates the predicted branch direction of no go to the branch, the instruction B1 should be prefetched next following the branch instruction BC1. Turning to Fig. 20, a clock pulse sequence CLK is depicted at the top in place of the instants shown in Figs. 3, 4, and 10 through 12. Operation of the instruction address register 41, the instruction memory unit 31, the request address adder 45, and the directory and the data memories 86 and 87 described in conjunction with Fig. 19, is schematically illustrated along lines labelled 41 , 31 , 45 , 86 , and 87 , respectively. On prefetching the instruction sequence under consideration, a boundary address A0 is stored in the instruction address register 41 for the eight byte instruction word which includes the instruction A0 as a foremost instruction. The instruction word A0, BC0 is read out of the instruction memory unit 31. In the meantime, the request address adder 45 produces the next request address A0 8 . Simultaneously with read out of the instruction word A0, BC0 , the branch history table 46 is retrieved. Inasmuch as the address information specifying the branch instruction address BC0 is stored in the directory memory 86, the address hit signal is delivered to the instruction prefetch control unit 47 with the logic one level. Furthermore, the branch information which comprises the branch destination address B1 , is delivered to the request address selector 42. The prefetch control unit 47 makes the request address selector 42 set the branch destination address B1 in the instruction address register 41 in the manner depicted along the line 41 . Incidentally, the branch destination address B1 is delivered also towards the first branch information register 51 together with the validity bit V. Responsive to the branch destination address B1 set in the instruction address register 41, the instruction memory unit 31 produces the instruction word , B1 . Meanwhile, the request address adder 45 produces the next request address B1 8 . The branch history table 46 is retrieved by the request address set in the instruction address register 41. Inasmuch as the directory memory 86 is loaded with the validity bit V of the logic zero level, the address hit signal is switched to the logic zero level. Prefetch proceeds along the no go to branch side by the use of successively calculated request addresses until the validity bit V of the logic one level is found in the branch history table 46 by retrieval with the request address for the instruction word B3, BC2 . The instruction words are thus read out of the instruction memory unit 31 and accumulated in the instruction buffer 43 as a queue in the order in which the prefetched instructions should be executed. Incidentally, it is possible to continue prefetch of the instructions on the no go to branch side for a short while even upon production of the address hit signal of the logic one level and to thereafter prefetch the instructions in the predicted branch direction. Further turning to Fig. 21, operation of the instruction address translating circuit 33, the address and the branch information fields of the actual branch information register 65, the prediction evaluating circuit 66 for the prediction evaluation signal PE, the instruction address adder 67, the selected destination address register 71, the instruction address register 41, and the write pulse flip flop 72, is schematically illustrated along lines labelled 33 , 65a , 65b , 66p , 67 , 71 , 41 , and 72 , respectively. The instruction sequence of Fig. 19 will be referred to. It will now be assumed that the address translation is carried out by the address translating circuit 33 for the branch instruction BC1. The predicted branch direction is to the no go to branch side as so far been assumed. Let an actual branch destination address D1 of a new branch destination instruction D1 not shown in Fig. 19 be obtained as a branch destination address on the go to branch side as a result of the instruction address translation. Irrespective of the predicted and the actual branch directions and destination addresses, the address information field of the actual branch information register 65 is loaded with the current branch instruction address BC1 and the instruction code length of the branch instruction BC1 in the manner depicted along the line labelled 65a . The branch information field is now loaded with the actual branch destination address D1 together with the logic one validity bit in the manner shown along the line 65b . The BCT bit is not taken into consideration because the branch instruction BC1 is not a branch count instruction BCT. The instruction executing circuit 35 makes the actual branch direction signal indicate go to the branch. Inasmuch as the no go to branch side is indicated by the validity bit V supplied from the third branch information register 53, the prediction evaluating circuit 66 produces the prediction evaluation signal PE of the logic one level which indicates that the predicted branch direction is incorrect. Irrespective of the prediction evaluation signal PE, the instruction address adder 67 produces the next instruction address B2 as the branch destination address on the no go to branch side. Rather than the branch destination address on the no go to branch side, the actual branch destination address D1 is selected by the instruction address selector 69 and stored in the selected destination address register 71 as the selected destination address together with the logic one validity bit. Responsive to the logic one prediction evaluation signal, the second selection signal Fig. 18 makes the request address selector 42 set the current branch instruction address BC1 in the instruction address register 41 in preparation for renewal of the branch history table 46. When the write pulse flip flop 72 delivers a write pulse to the branch history table 46, the branch information for the current branch instruction address BC1 held in the instruction address register 41, is renewed in the branch history table 46 by the selected branch destination address held in the selected destination address register 71 together with the logic one validity bit. At the substantially same time, the third selection signal moves the selected destination address from the selected destination address register 71 to the instruction address register 41. The prefetch proceeds to the instruction D1. In connection with Figs. 20 and 21, the branch instruction BC0 will again be taken into consideration. In the manner described for the branch instruction BC1 in conjunction with Fig. 21, the instruction address adder 67 calculates the next instruction address A1 Fig. 19 as the branch destination address on the no go to branch side. If the actual branch direction signal indicates no go to the branch, the next instruction address A1 is selected by the instruction address selector 69 and stored in the selected destination address register 71 as a selected destination address together with a logic zero validity bit. Prior thereto, the prediction evaluation signal PE is switched to the logic one level. Upon production of the second selection signals, the current branch instruction address BC0 is set in the instruction address register 41. With reference to the logic zero validity bit stored in the selected destination address register 71, the write pulse cancels the branch destination address B1 hitherto stored in the data memory 87 for the branch instruction BC0. In addition, the validity bit V is reset. The third selection signal moves the next instruction address A1 from the selected destination address register 71 to the instruction address register 41. The prefetch proceeds to the instruction A1. From the description thus far made here and there in connection with renewal of the branch history table 46, it will now be understood that use is possible of various algorithms on renewing the branch history table 46 as regards the branch destination address and the validity bit V. Depending on the algorithms, the renewal may statistically be carried out by keeping the results of actual execution of each branch instruction until completion of the instruction sequence being dealt with. When a new entry pair of first and second entries should be stored afresh in the branch history table 46, a problem may arise as regards the sets in which the new entry pair should be substituted for an existing entry pair. It is desirable in this event to resort to the least recent use LRU scheme, according to which the sets are selected where the existing entry pair was used oldest among the existing entry pairs. Alternatively, the first in first out FIFO scheme may be resorted to. The scheme is to select the sets where the existing entry pair was stored earliest of the existing entry pairs. Referring to Fig. 22, operation of the instruction address translating circuit 33, the address and the branch information fields of the actual branch information register 65, the prediction evaluating circuit 66 for the branch evaluation signal BE, the instruction address adder 67, the selected destination address register 71, the instruction address register 41, and the write pulse flip flop 72, is schematically illustrated along lines labelled 33 , 65a , 65b , 66b , 67 , 71 , 41 , and 72 . Attention is now directed to a branch count instruction BCT which is exemplified in Fig. 7 and has the instruction A1 on the go to branch side, namely, foremost in a loop, and the instruction B1 on the no go to branch side, namely, as an instruction which stands foremost when the loop is left. It will now be assumed that the branch count instruction BCT indicates leave of the loop. Nearly one machine cycle after the instruction address translation carried out by the instruction address translating circuit 33 for the branch count instruction BCT, the address information field of the actual branch information register 65 is loaded with a current branch instruction address BCT and an instruction code length of the branch count instruction BCT. The branch information field of the actual branch information register 65 is loaded with an actual branch destination address A1 of the instruction A1 on the go to branch side because the validity bit V is kept at the logic one level for each branch count instruction. The prediction evaluating circuit 66 produces the branch evaluation signal BE with the logic one level in this case of leave of the loop, Meanwhile, the instruction address adder 67 calculates an instruction address B1 for the instruction B1 on the no go to branch side. Inasmuch as the actual branch direction is no go to the branch, the actual branch direction signal makes the instruction address selector 69 select the instruction address B1 , which is stored in the selected destination address register 71 and delivered directly to the request address selector 42. The fourth selection signal Fig. 18 makes the request address selector 42 store the instruction address B1 in the instruction address register 41. Inasmuch as the prediction evaluation signal PE is kept at the logic zero level, the write pulse flip flop 72 produces no write pulse. The branch history table 46 is kept as it stands. The prefetch proceeds with the loop left. Referring now to Fig. 23, a data processing system comprises an instruction prefetching device according to a second embodiment of this invention. The data processing system and the instruction prefetching device comprise similar parts designated by like reference numerals except the following. An instruction executing circuit 151 and an instruction prefetch control unit 152 are substituted for the corresponding circuit and unit 35 and 47 described heretobefore. It will become clear as the description proceeds that the instruction executing circuit 151 produces a count 1 signal CT besides the actual branch direction signal which is now indicated at BD. A prediction evaluating or confirming circuit 156 is used in place of the corresponding circuit 66 described above and is supplementarily supplied with the count 1 signal CT. The prediction evaluating circuit 156 produces a prediction failure signal PF, a branch history table renewing or updating signal BH, and a go no go selecting or go selecting signal GO. The prediction failure signal PF and the branch history table renewing signal BH will later be described in detail. The go selecting signal GO has the logic one and zero levels in the marker which will also be described later. Instead of the actual branch direction signal BD described hereinabove, the go selecting signal GO makes the instruction address selector 69 select, as the selected instruction address, the actual branch destination address of the actual branch information register 65 and the next instruction address of the instruction address adder 67 when the go selecting signal GO is given the logic one and zero levels, respectively. The instruction prefetch control unit 152 is supplied with the address hit signal from the branch history table 46 as before and with the actual branch direction signal BD, the prediction failure signal PF, and the branch history table renewing signal BH. The selected instruction address is not delivered to the request address selector 42 in the instruction prefetching device being illustrated but only to the selected destination address register 71 and stored therein as the selected destination address. The selected destination address is merely fed to the branch history table 46 rather than also to the request address selector 42 in the manner described above. Instead, the request address selector 42 is supplied with the actual branch destination address from the actual branch information register 65 and the next instruction address from the instruction address adder 67. In the manner which will become clear as the description proceeds, an instruction address recover register 157 has an accompanying selector which is similar to the request address selector 42. The accompanying selector is supplied from the request address adder 45 with the next request address, from the branch history table 46 with the branch information comprising a predicted branch destination address, from the actual branch information register 65 with the actual branch destination address, and from the instruction address adder 67 with the next instruction address. The instruction address recover register 157 delivers one of such addresses as a new destination address to the request address selector 42. The instruction prefetch control unit 152 controls not only the request address selector 42 but also the accompanying selector. In the manner which will also become clear as the description proceeds, the predicted branch direction of a branch count instruction BCT is usually go to the branch, namely, is indicative of repeated execution of the branch count instruction BCT. The predicted branch direction is switched temporarily to no go to the branch, namely, to a temporary branch direction indicative of leave of the loop during penultimate execution of the branch count instruction BCT followed by ultimate execution of the branch count instruction on leaving the loop. The predicted branch direction is again switched to go to the branch, namely, to a usual branch direction indicative of the repeated execution during the ultimate execution. Turning to Fig. 24, the instruction executing circuit 151 is not much different from a conventional instruction executing circuit of the type thus far described and comprises a general purpose register 161. A control register 162 is for storing the decoded operation code and the R and the X fields received from the operation code decode 57 and the instruction register 56 of the instruction decoding circuit 36 described in connection with Fig. 9 through three registers which are depicted outwardly of the instruction executing circuit 151 without the reference numerals and are for feeding the decoded operation code and the R and the X fields in timed relation to operation of the operand address generating circuit 37 Fig. 1 , the operand address translating circuit 38, and the operand reading unit 39, respectively. The general purpose register 161 is selected by the R and the X fields held in the control register 162 and twice produces its content. An arithmetic logic unit 165 has first and second inputs. It is known in the art that the content of the general purpose register 161 is delivered directly to the first input of the arithmetic logic unit 165 and that the operand is delivered from the operand reading unit 39 to a register 166 and thence to a selector 167. Controlled by the decoded operation code held in the control register 162, the selector 167 selectively sends the content of the general purpose register 161 and the operand of the register 166 to the second input of the arithmetic logic unit 165. Controlled also by the decoded operation code, the arithemetic logic unit 165 produces a result of operation which is supplied to a result register 169 among others. The result of operation held in the result register 169 is delivered back to the instruction decoding circuit 36 on the one hand and to the general purpose register 161 on the other hand. When the instruction executing circuit 151 is dealing with a branch count instruction BCT, the number of times of repeated execution of a loop for the branch count instruction BCT is set in the general purpose register 161. The arithmetic logic unit 165 subtracts one from the content of the general purpose register 161 to produce a reduced count as the result of operation each time when the loop is executed in compliance with the branch count instruction BCT. The reduced count is fed back to the general purpose register 161 through the result register 169. The general purpose register 161 therefore holds a count which is reduced one by one during repeated execution of the branch count instruction BCT. The result of operation is delivered furthermore to a comparator 171 and to a condition code generator 172. The comparator 171 is for comparing the result of operation with a predetermined number to produce a result of comparison. It is known in the art that a condition code is generated by the condition code generator 172, is held in a condition code register 173 controlled by the decoded operation code, and is fed from the condition code register 173 to a branch evaluation circuit 175, which is supplied additionally with the result of comparison. Controlled by the decoded operation code held in the control register 162, the branch evaluation circuit 175 produces the actual branch direction signal BD for either of the general branch instruction and the branch count instruction BCT. In the instruction executing circuit 151 for use in combination with the embodiment being illustrated, the result of comparison is produced as the count 1 signal CT when the instruction under execution is a branch count instruction BCT. The count 1 signal CT takes the logic one and zero levels when the count is equal to the predetermined number, such as unity, and is not, respectively. The predetermined number is selected so that the loop should be executed only once more and should be left when the count 1 signal CT has the logic one level and is turned back to the logic zero level, respectively. It should clearly be understood that the count 1 signal CT is somewhat different from the branch evaluation signal BE described before in that the count 1 signal CT indicates leave of the loop when switched back to the logic zero level immediately after turning to the logic one level. Incidentally, it is convenient to understand that the illustrated portion of the instruction executing circuit 151 serves as an element used in the instruction prefetching device being illustrated in producing the actual branch direction signal BD for either of the general branch instruction and the branch count instruction BCT. The element is used in moreover producing the count 1 signal CT as a loop repetition signal indicative for a branch count instruction BCT, as by the logic one level, the above mentioned penultimate execution. The loop repetition signal furthermore indicates, as by the logic one level, the ultimate execution and the repeated execution except for the penultimate execution. The instruction address translating circuit 33 serves as another element used in the instruction prefetching device in producing the actual branch destination address. Further turning to Fig. 25, the prediction evaluating circuit 156 comprises the coincidence circuit 121, the flip flops 122 and 123, the BCT bit true false circuit 126, the actual branch direction true false circuit 127, and the validity bit true false circuit 128, all of which are described in conjunction with Fig. 17. A count 1 true false circuit 176 is supplied with the count 1 signal from the instruction executing circuit 151 and produces an inverted count 1 signal and the count 1 signal as it stands. The coincidence signal is delivered from the coincidence circuit 121, held in the flip flop 122, and fed thence to a NOT circuit 177 which produces the inverted coincidence signal of the type described hereinabove. A first AND circuit 181 is supplied with the inverted BCT bit, the inverted actual branch direction signal, and the validity bit produced by the validity bit true false circuit 128. A second AND circuit 182 is supplied with the inverted BCT bit, the actual branch direction signal from the actual branch direction true false circuit 127, and the inverted validity bit. The BCT bit true false circuit 126 delivers the BCT bit to third through sixth AND circuits 183, 184, 185, and 186. The actual branch direction true false circuit 127 delivers the actual branch direction signal to the fourth through the sixth AND circuits 184 to 186. The third AND circuit 183 is additionally supplied with the inverted actual branch direction signal and the inverted validity bit. The fourth AND circuit 184 is supplied with the inverted count 1 signal and the inverted validity bit. The fifth AND circuit 185 is supplied with the count 1 signal from the count 1 true false circuit 176 and the validity bit from the validity bit true false circuit 128. The sixth AND circuit 186 is supplied with the inverted count 1 signal. A seventh AND circuit 187 is supplied with the validity bit from the validity bit true false circuit 128 and the inverted coincidence signal. A first Exclusive OR circuit 191 is supplied with the actual branch direction signal from the actual branch direction true false circuit 127 and the validity bit from the validity bit true falsu circuit 128. A second Exclusive OR circuit 192 is supplied with the BCT bit from the BCT bit true false circuit 126 and the actual branch direction signal from the actual branch direction true false circuit 127. A first two input OR circuit 196 is for producing the prediction failure signal PF in response to outputs of the first Exclusive OR circuit 191 and the seventh AND circuit 187. A second two input OR circuit 197 is for producing the go selecting signal GO in response to outputs of the second Exclusive OR circuit 192 and the sixth AND circuit 186. A six input OR circuit 198 is for producing the branch history table renewing signal BH in response to outputs of the first through the fifth and the seventh AND circuits 181 to 185 and 187. Referring to Fig. 26, the prediction evaluating circuit 156 illustrated with reference to Fig. 25 is operable in the manner depicted in first through fifteenth lines 1 to 15. Combinations of the logic one and zero levels are shown by 1 and 0, respectively, for the BCT bit, the actual branch direction signal BD, the count 1 signal CT, the validity bit V, and the coincidence between the predicted and the actual branch destination addresses. The coincidence is illustrated at COINC with coincidence and incoincidence indicated by 1 and 0, respectively. The prediction failure signal PF, the branch history table renewing signal BH, and the go selecting signal GO are given the logic one and zero levels in the manner represented by 1 and 0, respectively. Incidentally, don t care is indicated by short horizontal lines. When given the logic one level, the prediction failure signal PF makes the instruction prefetch control unit 152 again prefetch a new instruction in the manner which will later become clear. When given the logic one level, the branch history table renewing signal BH makes the write pulse flip flop 72 produce a write pulse and furthermore makes the instruction prefetch control unit 152 control the request address selector 42 and the accompanying selector as will later become clear. In the manner described above, the go selecting signal GO controls the instruction address selector 69. More particularly referring to Figs. 25 and 26, the prediction failure signal PF is given the logic one level irrespective of the BCT bit and the count 1 signal CT in either of first and second cases which will be described in the following. The first case is a case where the actual branch direction is incoincident with the predicted branch direction, namely, where the actual branch direction signal BD and the validity bit V have one and the other of the logic one and zero levels, respectively, in the manner indicated in the second through the fourth, the eighth through the tenth, and the thirteenth lines 2 to 4, 8 to 10, and 13. The second case is another case where the actual and the predicted branch directions are both towards the go to branch side and furthermore where the actual branch direction address is incoincident with the predicted branch destination address, namely, where the actual branch direction signal BD and the validity bit V are both of the logic one level with the coincidence COINC rendered 0 as indicated in the fifth, the eleventh, and the fourteenth lines 5, 11, and 14. When the instruction being executed is a general branch instruction and gives the logic zero level to the BCT bit, the branch history table renewing signal BH is given the logic one level in the manner described for the prediction failure signal PF and indicated in the second through the fifth lines 2 to 5. More specifically, the branch history table renewing signal BH is given the logic one level either when the actual and the predicted branch directions are incoincident with each other or when the actual and the predicted branch directions are both go to the branch and moreover when the actual and the predicted branch destination addresses are incoincident with each other. When a branch count instruction BCT is under execution to give the logic one level to the BCT bit, the branch history table renewing signal BH is given the logic one level in one of third through sixth cases defined in the following. The third case is a case where the actual and the predicted branch directions are both no go to the branch, namely, where the actual branch direction signal BD and the validity bit V are both of the logic zero level in the manner indicated in the seventh line 7. The fourth case is a case where the predicted branch direction is towards the go to branch side and furthermore where the actual and the predicted branch destination addresses are incoincident with each other, namely, where the validity bit V has the logic one level with the coincidence COINC rendered 0 as indicated in the eighth, the eleventh, and the fourteenth lines 8, 11, and 14. The fifth case is a case where the actual and the predicted branch directions are to the go and the no go to branch sides, respectively, and moreover where the loop should be left, namely, where the actual branch derection signal BD, the validity bit V, and the count 1 signal CT have the logic one, zero, and zero levels, respectively, in the manner indicated in the tenth line 10. The sixth case is a case where the actual and the predicted branch directions are both go to the branch and furthermore where the loop should be left, namely, where the actual branch direction signal DB, the validity bit V, and the count 1 signal CT are all of the logic one level as indicated in the fifteenth line 15. If a general branch instruction is in execution to give the logic zero level to the BCT bit, the go selecting signal GO is given the logic one level as indicated in the fourth and the fifth lines 4 and 5 when the general branch instruction indicates go to the branch, namely, when the actual branch direction signal BD has the logic one level. If a branch count instruction BCT is executed to give the logic one level to the BCT bit, the go selecting signal GO is given the logic one level in either of seventh and eighth cases specified in the following. The seventh case is a case where the branch count instruction BCT actually indicates no go to the branch, namely, where the actual branch direction signal BD is of the logic zero level in the manner indicated in the seventh and the eighth lines 7 and 8. The eighth case is another case where the branch count instruction BCT actually indicates go to the branch and additionally where the loop should be left, namely, where the actual branch direction signal BD is made to have the logic one level with the count 1 signal CT given the logic zero level as indicated in the tenth and the eleventh lines 10 and 11. Briefly summarizing, it is possible to understand that the prediction failure signal and the branch history table renewing signal are concurrently produced for the general branch instruction either unless the predicted branch direction is coincident with the actual branch direction or unless the predicted branch destination address is coincident with the actual branch destination address despite coincidence between the predicted and the actual branch directions. The prediction failure signal and the branch history table renewing signal are concurrently produced for the branch count instruction BCT when the loop repetition signal indicates the repeated execution and furthermore when the predicted branch direction indicates leave of the loop despite the actual branch direction indicative of the repeated execution, namely, when the branch history table 46 does not memorize the branch information for a branch count instruction BCT indicative of the repeated execution except the penultimate execution. Only the branch history table renewing signal is singly produced for the branch count instruction BCT when the loop repetition signal indicates either of the penultimate and the ultimate execution. Turning to Fig. 27, the instruction prefetch control unit 152 comprises first through fourth true false circuits 211, 212, 213, and 214 supplied with the branch history table renewing signal BH held in a flip flop 216 during one machine cycle, the actual branch direction signal BD, the prediction failure signal PF, and the address hit signal, respectively. The branch history table renewing signal BH is delivered as it is to the request address selector 42 as a first selection signal. Responsive to the first selection signal, the request address selector 42 selects the current branch instruction address fed thereto from the actual branch information register 65. The first true false circuit 211 delivers the branch history table renewing signal BH with a delay of one machine cycle as a second selection signal to the request address selector 42 which selects thereupon the new destination address fed thereto from the instruction address recover register 157. First through third AND circuits 221 222, and 223 are enabled by an inverted branch history table renewing signal supplied thereto from the first true false circuit 211 with the delay of one machine cycle. Additionally responsive to the actual branch direction signal and the prediction failure signal fed from the second and the third true false circuits 212 and 213, respectively, the first AND circuit 221 delivers a third selection signal to the request address selector 42 to make the same select the actual branch destination address fed thereto from the actual branch information register 65. Responsive to an inverted actual branch direction signal delivered from the second true false circuit 212 and to the prediction failure signal supplied from the third true false circuit 213 as it sands, the second AND circuit 222 feeds a fourth selection signal to the request address selector 42 for selection of the next instruction address fed from the instruction address adder 67. Responsive to the address hit signal supplied from the fourth true false circuit 214 as it is, the third AND circuit 223 delivers a fifth selection signal to the request address selector 42 for selection of the predicted branch destination address fed from the branch history table 46 as the branch information. First through fourth NOT circuits 226, 227, 228, and 229 are supplied with the second through the fifth selection signals, respectively. The NOT circuits 226 through 229 send inverted second through fifth selection signals to a four input AND circuit 230, which delivers a sixth selection signal to the request address selector 42 to make the latter select the next request address fed thereto from the request address adder 45. A first additional AND circuit 236 is supplied with the actual branch direction signal and the prediction failure signal from the second and the third true false circuits 212 and 213, respectively, as they stand. The first additional AND circuit 236 delivers a first additional selection signal to the accompanying selector of the instruction address recover register 157 for selection of the actual branch destination address fed from the actual branch information register 65. Responsive to the inverted prediction failure signal and the prediction failure signal supplied from the third true false circuit 213 as it is, a second additional AND circuit 237 delivers a second additional selection signal to the accompanying selector which selects the next instruction address fed thereto from the instruction address adder 67. Responsive to the inverted prediction failure signal and the address hit signal supplied from the fourth true false circuit 214 as it stands, a third additional AND circuit 238 delivers a third additional selection signal to the accompanying selector to make the latter select the predicted branch destination address fed thereto from the branch history table 46. Responsive to the inverted prediction failure signal and the inverted address hit signal, a fourth additional AND circuit 239 delivers a fourth additional selection signal to the accompanying selector to make the same select the next request address fed thereto from the request address adder 45. It is now understood that the branch history table renewing signal BH of the logic one level makes the instruction address register 41 hold the current branch instruction address of the actual branch information register 65 and, one machine cycle thereafter, the new destination address of the instruction address recover register 157. When the go to branch side is indicated by the actual branch direction signal BH and is nevertheless incorrect according to the prediction failure signal PF, the actual branch destination address of the actual branch information register 65 is stored in both of the instruction address register 41 and the instruction address recover regester 157. When the no go to branch side is indicated by the actual branch direction signal BD despite the incorrectness indicated by the prediction failure signal PF, the next instruction address of the instruction address adder 67 is stored in the instruction address register 41 and the instruction address recover register 157. When the address hit signal has the logic one level, the predicted branch destination address of the branch history table 46 is set in the instruction address register 41. In other cases, the next request address of the request address adder 45 is set in the instruction address register 41. If the prediction failure signal PF indicates incorrectness of the prediction with the address hit signal given the logic one level, the next instruction address of the instruction address adder 67 is stored in the instruction address recover register 157. If the prediction failure signal PF indicates correctness of the prediction with the address hit signal given the logic zero level, the next request address of the request address adder 45 is stored in the instruction address recover register 157. Referring now to Fig. 28 which is similar to Fig. 21, operation of the instruction address translating circuit 33, the address information field of the actual branch information register 65, and the branch information field thereof is schematically depicted along lines labelled 33 , 65a , and 65b , respectively. The prediction failure signal PF and the branch history table renewing signal BH are illustrated along lines specified by PF and BH , respectively. Operation of the instruction address adder 67, the selected destination address register 71, the instruction address recover register 157, the instruction address register 41, and the write pulse flip flop 72 is shown along lines indicated by 67 , 71 , 157 , 41 , and 72 . It will now be assumed that the instruction address translating circuit 33 is carrying out the address translation for a general branch instruction BC1 in the manner illustrated in Fig. 21 and along the line labelled 33 and that the instruction executing circuit 151 later finds that the actual branch direction is go to the branch despite the predicted branch direction towards the no go to branch side. Nearly one machine cycle after the address translation for the branch instruction BC1, the instruction code length of the branch instruction BC1 and the current instruction address BC1 are stored in the actual branch information register 65 as shown along the line 65a from the third branch information register 53. The actual branch destination address D1 of an instruction D1 on the go to branch side is stored in the actual branch information regiser 65 from the instruction address translating circuit 33 as depicted along the line 65b . The validity bit V is kept in the third branch information register 53 with the logic zero level indicative of the predicted branch direction of no go to the branch and is delivered, about one machine cycle earlier, to the prediction evaluating circuit 156. Substantially at the instant of storage of the addresses information and the branch information in the actual branch information register 65, the prediction evaluating circuit 156 switches the prediction failure signal PF and the branch history table renewing signal BH to the logic one level in the manner illustrated along the lines PF and BH and in Fig. 26 in the fourth line 4. Irrespective of the prediction failure signal PF and the branch history table renewing signal BH, the instruction address adder 67 calculates the next instruction address B2 of an instruction B2 on the no go to branch side in the manner depicted along the line 67 . The go selecting signal GO has the logic one level according to the fourth line 4 of Fig. 26. The instruction address selector 69 therefore stores the actual branch destination address D1 in the selected destination address register 71 in the manner depicted along the line 71 . The current instruction address BC1 is delivered to the instruction address register 41 directly from the actual branch information register 65. Likewise, the actual branch destination address D1 is fed towards the instruction address register 41 and the instruction address recover register 157. Inasmuch as the actual branch direction signal BD and the prediction failure signal PF are both of the logic one level, the first additional selection signal Fig. 27 stores the actual branch destination address D1 in the instruction address recover register 157 as illustrated along the line 157 . Inasmuch as the branch history table renewing signal BH is switched to the logic one level, the first selection signal Fig. 27 stores the current instruction address BC1 in the instruction address register 41 as depicted along the line 41 on the left side. One machine cycle after turning of the branch history table renewing signal BH to the logic one level and substantially concurrently with storage of the current instruction address BC1 in the instruction address register 41, the write pulse flip flop 72 produces the write pulse illustrated along the line 72 . In the example illustrated in Fig. 19, the branch history table 46 memorizes no predicted branch destination address and the logic zero validity bit in correspondence to the current instruction address BC1 . The write pulse stores the actual branch destination address D1 and the logic one validity bit in correspondence to the current instruction address BC1 . One machine cycle thereafter, the second selection signal transfers the actual branch destination address D1 to the instruction address register 41 as shown along the line 41 on the right side from the instruction address recover register 157. The instruction D1 is prefetched. If the actual and the predicted branch directions are both go to the branch, the prediction failure signal PF is switched to the logic one level as shown in Fig. 26 in the fifth line 5 when the actual branch destination address D1 obtained by the instruction translating circuit 33 is incoincident with the predicted branch destination address memorized in the branch history table 46 and delivered to the prediction evaluating circuit 156. The branch history table renewing signal BH and the go selecting signal GO are also turned to the logic one level. Operation proceeds in the manner depicted in Fig. 28 with the predicted branch destination address renewed by the write pulse to the actual branch destination address D1 . If the actual branch direction is no go to the branch despite the predicted branch direction of go to the branch, the prediction failure signal PF and the branch history table renewing signal BH are turned to the logic one level in the manner which is illustrated along the lines PF and BH and is shown in Fig. 26 in either of the second and the third lines 2 and 3. The go selecting signal GO is, however, kept at the logic zero level. The instruction address selector 69 selects the next instruction address B2 , which is stored in the selected destination address register 71. Inasmuch as the actual branch direction signal BD indicates no go to the branch, the second additional selection signal Fig. 27 stores the next instruction address B2 in the instruction address recover register 157. The first selection signal sets the current instruction address BC1 in the instruction address register 41. The write pulse resets the logic one validity bit indicative of the predicted branch direction of the go to branch side. One machine cycle thereafter, the second selection signal transfers the next instruction address B2 from the instruction address recover register 157 to the instruction address register 41 for prefetch of the instruction B2. Turning to Fig. 29, it will now be assumed that the instruction address translating circuit 33 carries out the address translation on a branch count instruction BCT described in connection with Fig. 7 and that the count 1 signal CT is switched to the logic one level. It is already pointed out that the count 1 signal CT of the logic one level indicates that the first through the n th instructions A1 to An should be prefetched with the penultimate execution of the branch count instruction BCT immediately followed. Before the penultimate execution, the branch count instruction BCT indicates the usual branch direction of go to the branch as the predicted branch direction. When the logical address of the branch count instruction BCT is delivered to the instruction address translating circuit 33, the third branch information register 53 is loaded with the BCT bit produced by the instruction decoding circuit 36 with the logic one level, the instruction code length of the branch count instruction BCT, the current instruction address BCT , and the validity bit V indicative of the predicted branch direction of the go to branch side. When the instruction address translating circuit 33 deals with the branch count instruction BCT, the actual branch information register 65 is loaded with the address information of the branch count instruction BCT and with an actual branch destination address A1 of the first instruction A1 which follows the branch count instruction BCT on the go to branch side. Inasmuch as the predicted and the actual branch directions are both go to the branch with the predicted and the actual branch destination addresses coincident with each other and with the count 1 signal CT turned to the logic one level, the prediction failure signal PF is kept at the logic zero level while the branch history table renewing signal BH is switched to the logic one level in the manner illustrated along the lines PF and BH and in Fig. 26 in the fifteenth line 15. Irrespective of coincidence and incoincidence between the actual and the predicted branch directions and other conditions, the instruction address adder 67 produces a next instruction address B1 of the above mentioned other instruction B1. The go selecting signal GO has the logic zero level as indicated in Fig. 26 in the fifteenth line 15. The instruction address selector 69 therefore stores the next instruction address B1 in the selected destination address register 71 in the manner depicted along the line 71 . The current instruction address BCT is supplied to the instruction address register 41 directly from the actual branch information register 65. Similarly, the actual branch destination address A1 is delivered towards the instruction address register 41 and the instruction address recover register 157. Inasmuch as neither of the first and the second additional selection signals Fig. 27 is produced, the instruction address recover register 157 is not loaded with the actual branch destination address A1 . The first selection signal stores the current instruction addresses BCT in the instruction address register 41 in the manner illustrated along the line 41 in the middle part. One machine cycle earlier, the instruction address A1 is set in the instruction address register 41 as depicted along the line 41 in the leftmost part for the ultimate prefetch of the first instruction A1. The request address adder 45 calculates a next request address. It will be presumed that the instruction address A2 of the second instruction A2 is given by the next request address. When the first instruction A1 is neither a general branch instruction nor a branch count instruction BCT, the address hit signal has the logic zero level. The fourth additional selection signal Fig. 27 therefore stores the next request address A2 in the instruction address recover register 157 as shown along the line 157 . When the write pulse flip flop 72 produces the write pulse in the manner depicted along the line 72 , the selected destination address register 71 is loaded with the next instruction address B1 on the no go to branch side. The write pulse therefore only resets the validity bit V in the branch history table 46. It will be understood that the predicted branch direction is switched to the no go to branch side. One machine cycle thereafter, the second selection signal transfers the next request address A2 from the instruction address recover register 157 to the instruction address register 41 as shown along the line 41 in the rightmost part. The second instruction A2 is prefetched. One machine cycle is lost in renewing the validity bit V in the branch history table 46. If the first instruction A1 is a branch instruction for which the second entry is valid, the third additional selection signal stores the predicted branch destination address in the instruction address recover register 157. The prefetch may proceed to the predicted branch destination address. It will now be assumed that the count 1 signal CT is switched back to the logic zero level to indicate that the loop should be left after the first through the n th instructions A1 to An are ultimately prefetched before leave of the loop with the ultimate execution of the branch count instruction BCT immediately following the prefetch. After the penultimate execution of the branch count instruction BCT and before the ultimate execution thereof, the branch count instruction BCT indicates the no go to the branch as the temporary branch direction. The actual branch direction is also no go to the branch. The actual branch destination address is the instruction address A1 of the first instruction A1. According to the seventh line 7 of Fig. 26, the prediction failure signal PF is held at the logic zero level and the branch history table renewing signal BH has the logic one level as shown along the lines PF and BH . The instruction address adder 67 again produces the next instruction address B1 . The go selection signal GO has the logic one level according to the seventh line 7 of Fig. 26. The instruction address selector 69 therefore stores the actual branch destination address A1 in the selected destination register 71. Inasmuch as the actual direction signal BD and the prediction failure signal PF are both of the logic zero level, the second additional selection signal stores the next instruction address B1 in the instruction address recover register 157. As before, the first selection signal sets the current instruction address BCT in the instruction address register 41. When the write pulse is produced in the manner depicted along the line 72 , the branch history table 46 is renewed to the actual branch destination address A1 with the validity bit V made to indicate the go to branch side as the predicted branch direction. One machine cycle thereafter, the second selection signal moves the next instruction address B1 from the instruction address recover register 157 to the instruction address register 41. The other instruction B1 is prefetched. It is understood that one machine cycle is again lost in updating the branch history table 46 for the branch count instruction BCT and that no machine cycle is lost on again entering the loop because the branch count instruction BCT and the branch information therefor are correctly memorized in the branch history table 46. It is now understood that the validity bit V indicative of the predicted branch direction is renewed to indicate the temporary branch direction in response to the branch history table renewing signal which is singly produced for the branch count instruction BCT when the loop repetition signal indicates the penultimate execution of the branch count instruction BCT. The validity bit V indicative of the temporary branch direction is renewed to indicate the usual branch direction with the predicted branch destination address made to indicate the instruction address of the first instruction A1 in response to the branch history table renewing signal which is singly produced for the branch count instruction BCT when the loop repetition signal indicates the ultimate execution of the branch count instruction BCT. Incidentally, the prefetch proceeds in the manner described with reference to Fig. 28 when the actual and the predicted branch destination addresses are incoincident with each other as shown in Fig. 26 in either of the eleventh and the fourteenth lines 11 and 14. Further turning to Fig. 30, it will now be assumed that the predicted branch direction is go to the branch for the branch count instruction BCT and that the actual branch direction is no go to the branch with the predicted and the actual branch destination addresses coincident with each other. As in Fig. 29, the actual branch destination address A1 is stored in the branch information field of the actual branch information register 65. In the manner illustrated along the lines indicated by labels PF and BH , the prediction failure signal PF is switched to the logic one level and the branch history table renewing signal BH is kept at the logic zero level according to the ninth line 9 of Fig. 26. When the actual branch direction signal BD indicative of the no go to branch side is produced, the second additional selection signal Fig. 27 stores the next instruction address B1 in the instruction address recover register 157. The fourth selection signal sets the next instruction address B1 in the instruction address register 41. Prefetch proceeds to the other instruction B1. If the predicted and the actual branch directions are to the no go and the go to branch sides, respectively with the count 1 signal CT turned to the logic one level, the prediction failure signal PF and the branch history table renewing signal BH have the logic one and zero levels, respectively, according to the thirteenth line 13 of Fig. 26. When the actual branch direction signal BD indicative of the go to branch side is produced, the first additional selection signal scores the actual branch destination address A1 in the instruction address recover register 157. The third selection signal sets the actual branch destination address A1 in the instruction address register 41. Prefetch proceeds to the first instruction A1. Incidentally, the write pulse is not produced. The branch history table 46 is left untouched. The selected destination register 71 may or may not be loaded with either of the next requist address B1 and the actual branch destination address A1 . If the predicted and the actual branch directions are towards the no go and the go to branch sides, respectively, with the predicted and the actual branch destination addresses coincident with each other in the manner illustrated in the eighth line 8 of Fig. 26, prefetch proceeds as described in connection with Fig. 28. Also if the predicted and the actual branch directions are to the no go and the go to branch sides, respectively, with the count 1 signal CT kept at the logic zero level as depicted in the tenth line 10 of Fig. 26, prefetch proceeds in the manner described in conjunction with Fig. 28. The case indicated in the tenth line 10 occurs when the branch information should afresh be stored in the branch history table 46 for a branch count instruction BCT. It is important to note the case described in conjuction with the tenth line 10 of Fig. 26. The second entry which corresponds in the branch history table 46 to the instruction address of the branch count instruction, is refreshed in this case in response to the prediction failure signal and the branch history table renewing signal which are concurrently produced for the branch count instruction BCT. The prediction failure signal and the branch history table renewing signal are so produced because the predicted branch direction is not memorized in the branch history table 46 and indicates no go to the branch despite the actual branch direction of the go to branch side and because the loop repetition signal indicates the repeated execution of the branch count instruction BCT. Reviewing Figs. 28 through 30, it will be appreciated that the average loss cycle is only one machine cycle long for each general branch instruction. Five machine cycles are lost on entering a loop by afresh executing a branch count instruction BCT for which the address information and the branch information are not memorized in the branch history table 46. No machine cycle is lost on entering a loop for a branch count instruction BCT which has the address information and the branch information already in the branch history table 46. No machine cycle is lost during repeated instruction prefetch through the loop except the penultimate and the ultimate execution of the branch count instruction BCT. One machine cycle is lost for each of the penultimate and the ultimate execution on leaving the loop. This is shorter than the loss cycle of four machine cycles which are necessary on leaving a loop with the instruction prefetching device illustrated with reference to Fig. 1.
