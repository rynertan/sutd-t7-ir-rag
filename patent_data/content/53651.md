# Fluid pressure control valve for dual braking system.

## Abstract
A braking fluid pressure control apparatus 8 for a dual circuit type vehicle brake system is provided with a pair of pressure reducing or pressure limiting valve plungers 28L, 28R disposed in one housing 24 , with respective rear ends protruding out of the housing, and a biasing device 46 for commonly biasing both rear ends into the housing. The biasing device includes a guide rod 50 pivoted to the housing at an intermediate position of the pair of valve plungers which is tiltable in a direction parallel to a plane formed by the axes of both plungers. A transmitting member 56 having an operating portion 60 is slidably fitted on the guide rod 50 . The member 56 is biased by a spring 68 abutting the operating portion 60 at the rear ends of the plungers 28L, 28R . Tilting of the guide rod is limited to a minute angle range, with a result that when a pressure failure has occurred in one circuit the valve plunger influ enced by the pressure of the other circuit is obliged to singly resist the biasing force of the spring so as to start pressure reducing or limiting operation at a higher pressure level than in normal condition.
