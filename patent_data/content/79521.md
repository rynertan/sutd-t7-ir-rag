The following reaction schemes Processes A and B will aid in the understanding of the instant invention. PROCESS AEMI10.1 In Process A, an aldehyde or ketone such as 3 phenylpropionaldehyde I is reacted in a solvent such as methanol, with a dipeptide, such as alanylproline ala pro or an esterified dipeptide, and potassium cyanide in the presence of an acid such as acetic acid. The resulting amino nitrile, compound III , may then be hydrolyzed to yield the amino acid IV . Other useful solvents in the reaction for the formation of the amino nitrile compound III include the lower alkanols, typified by ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, and the like.Generally, the reaction conditions for the formation of III are 220C for about 24 hours. Hydrolysis of compound III to compound IV may be accomplished by acid or base hydrolysis, but acid hydrolysis, for example, with anhydrous HC1 in methanol, at OOC for 3 5 hours, is a preferred method. Conversion of compound IV to compound VII may be accomplished by treating compound IV with hydrogen bromide acetic acid and aqueous hydrobromic acid followed by ion exchange chromatography and medium pressure liquid chromatography MPLC to afford compound VII . PROCESS BEMI12.1 In Process B, an aldehyde or ketone such as 3 phenylpropionaldehyde I is reacted in solution with an esterified dipeptide such as tert butylalanylprolinate t butyl ala pro . A typical useful reaction solvent is methylene chloride. The resulting Schiff base may be isolated or reacted in situ with trimethylsilylcyanide and zinc bromide to form the amino nitrile compound III . Hydrolysis of the amino nitrile compound affords the desired carboxyalkyldipeptide IV . In addition to the hydrolysis methods described above in Process A, it has been determined that the use of acidic ion exchange resins provide a mild method for the hydrolytic conversion of unsubstituted carboxamides and carboxylic acid hydrazides to their corresponding acid or ester counterparts. The hydrolysis of aminonitriles III as also described above in Process A, can be used to prepare and isolate carboxamidoalkyl dipeptides VI which can subsequently be subjected to the action of acidic ion exchange resins to provide carboxyalkyldipeptides IV . The procedure comprises combining the amide or hydrazide with a large excess by weight about 15X of an acidic ion exchange resin such asAmberlyst 15 Rohm and Haas Co. in a suitable solvent such as water or a lower alkanol, for example, methanol, ethanol and the like and warming the mixture at reflux The desired product of the hydrolysis reaction is isolated by elution from the resin using a mixture of the reaction solvent and a base, for example, pyridine or triethylamine, followed by evaporation of the solvent The process of the present invention will best be understood when considered in view of the following examples which further illustrate the practice of Processes A and B for the formation of the carboxyalkyldipeptide compounds of Formula IV.

The mixture was stirred for 24 hours, diluted with methanol 5 ml , cooled ice bath and saturated with anhydrous hydrogen chloride. Water 0.03 ml was added and the cooled mixture was stirred for 3 hours. The mixture was evaporated to a white foam which was taken up in CHzC12 and filtered. The filtrate was then saturated with anhydrous ammonia and immediately concentrated to dryness. The residue was slurried in ethyl acetate and filtered through celite. The residue, after evaporation, was purified by chromatography on silica gel 2 1 hexane EtOAc .

EXAMPLE 13Methyl N I carbomethoxy 3 phenyl l propyl L alanyl L prolinate Treatment of the amidoacid prepared as described in Example 11 or of the amidoester prepared as described in Example 12 with a 15 fold excess by weight of Amberlyst 15 acidic resin in methanol for 48 hours at reflux can provide methyl N l carbo methoxy 3 phenyl 1 propyl L alanyl L orolinate as described in Example 1. Separation of the amidoesters by silica gel chromatography followed by treatment of each with Amberlyst 15 acidic resin can allow isolation of each diastereomer of the diester. EXAMPLE 14 When ethanol is substitutedsfor methanol in the Amberlyst 15 resin treatment in Example 1, the diester ethyl No carboethoxy 3 phenyl l propyl rJ N l carboethoxy 3 phenyl l propvl L alanyl L prolinate can be isolated. Separation of the diastereomers can be accomplished by silica gel chromatography. EXAMPLE 15 Treatment of the diastereomer of the diester described in Example 14 which is less mobile on silica gel in hexanes EtOAc , with a 4 1 mixture of concentrated HBr in HOAc and concentrated aqueous HBr can provide N l S carboethoxy 3 phenyl l propyl L alanyl L proline, which can then be converted to its maleate salt. Alternatively, treatment of the mixture of diastereomers of the diester described in Example 14, can provide the same product after purification and separation of diastereomers by reverse phase HPLC or crystallization of the maleate salt. EXAMPLE 16 When L alanyl L proline amide hydrochloride is substituted for L alanyl L proline hydrochloride in Example 12, the diamide, N l carboxamido 3phenyl l propyl L alanyl L proline amide, can be isolated as a mixture 1 1 of diastereomers.Separation of the diastereomers can be achieved by chromatography on silica gel. EXAMPLE 17 Treatment of each diastereomer of the diamide of Example 16 with a 15 fold excess by weight of Amberlyst 15 acidic resin in methanol can provide the correspondinq diastereomer diester,N l carbomethoxy 3 phenyl l propyl L alanyl Lprolinate.
