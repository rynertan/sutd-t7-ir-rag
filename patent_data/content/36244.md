## Description
DESCRIPTION HERBICIDAL COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING 1 3,4 DICHLOROBENZYL IMIDAZOLE N,N DIMETHYL 4,5 DICARBOXAMIDE The present invention relates to new herbicidal compositions comprising l 3,4 dichlorobenzyl imidazole NIN dimethyl 4,5 dicarboxamide of the formula EMI1.1 which is disclosed in the Specification of our BritishPatent Application No. 9277 77, in the Specification ofUnited States Patent No. 4185992 and in the Specification of our Belgian Patent No. 864614 as a pre and or post emergence herbicide, and to their use in agriculture. Phenylurea herbicides, for example isoproturon i.e. N,N dimethyl N 4 isopropylphenylurea , metoxuron i.e. Nl 3 chloro 4 methoxyphenyl N,N dimethylurea and chlortoluron i.e. N 3 chloro 4 methylphenyl N,N dimethylurea , are widely used for the control of grass and broad leafed weeds. For example isoproturon has been successfully used for several years to control the following weed species in cereal crops by pre or post emergence application Grass Weeds Broad leaf Weeds Poa annua Sinapis arvensis Phalaris minor Stellaria media Poa trivialis Chrysanthemum segetum Alopecurus myosuroides Chenopodium album Avena spica venti Senecio vulqaris Lolium riqidum Galeopsis tetrahit Lolium perenne Anthemis arvensis Avena fatua Anthemis cotula Avena ludoviciana Matricaria inodora Bromus sterilis Atriplex patula Papaver rhoeas Spergula arvensisIsoproturon may also be used to control the following broad leafed weeds Polyqonum convolvulus Fumaria officinalis Polygonum aviculare Aphanes arvensis Polyqonum persicaria Raphanus raphanistrum Polyqonum lapathifolium Anagallis arvensis Solanum niqrum Capsella bursa pastoris, Myosotis arvensis but with more variable results, necessitating the use of relatively high rates of application if reliable weed control is to be achieved. Metoxuron and chlortoluron have similar spectra of weed control. However, the extensive use of isoproturon and other phenylurea herbicides, in particular metoxuron and chlortoluron, by which certain species such asVeronica persica, Veronica arvensis, Veronica hederifolia,Viola tricolor and Viola arvensis are poorly controlled, has led to an increase in the population of Veronica andViola, such that they now constitute a serious weed problem in cereal growing. As a result of research and experimentation it has been discovered that the use of the compound 1 3,4 dichlorobenzyl imidazole N,N dimethyl 4,5 di carboxamide hereinafter referred to for convenience as Compound A in combination with isoproturon and or metoxuron extends their spectrum of activity to include the control of Veronica spp., and Viola spp. Therefore the said combined use represents an important technological advance. Surprisingly, in addition to this, it has been found that the combined herbicidal activity ofCompound A with isoproturon and or metoxuron against certain weed species is much greater than expected when applied post emergence e.g. as a post emergence spray , i.e. the herbicidal activity of Compound A with isoproturon and or metoxuron is synergistic. In particular, the combined herbicidal activity of Compound A with isoproturon has been found to be synergistic on post emergence application on the important weed Stellaria media, Matricaria inodora and polygonum species, in particular Polygonum aviculare, and the combined herbicidal activity of Compound A with metoxuron has been found to be synergistic on post emergence application on Stellaria media and Polyqonum species1 in particular Polyonum lapathifolium.In contrast it has been found that, although the combined use of Compound A and chlortoluron extends the spectrum of weed control to include the control of Veronica spp.and Viola spp.. the combined use of Compound A with chlortoluron against Stellaria media, Matricaria inodora and Polyqonum species, in particular Polygonum lapathifolium, is additive and not synergistic. Stellaria media, Matricaria inodora and Polyonum aviculare are three of the most serious weed problems encountered in cereal growing. Their rapid growth makes them extremely competitive with the crop and unless they are controlled they will seriously reduce crop yield.In addition Polyonum aviculare, known commonly as iron weed. knotgrass or wireweed, and Polvqonum lapathifolium known commonly as willow weed, can be a considerable hindrance to combine harvesting. The synergistic activities of isoproturon and or metoxuron with Compound A therefore represents a major advance in the control of these weeds. In commercial practice a wide spectrum herbicide for post emergence use in cereals must be expected to control Galium aparine in addition to those weeds already mentioned. If left uncontrolled this weed will thrive in the absence of competition from other weed species and will grow over the crop causing loss of yield and harvesting difficulties. For this reason, the combined use of isoproturon and or metoxuron withCompound A may also advantageously include a herbicide with good activity by post emergence application against Galium aparine, for example mecoprop i.e. 2 4 chloro 2 methylphenoxy propionic acid optionally in the form of metal1 e.g. sodium or potassium or amine salts or esters at rates of 0.5 2 kg a.i. ha.By the abbreviation a.i. in meant active ingredient , e.g. the amount of mecoprop. By the abbreviation ha is meant hectare. Accordingly the present invention provides a method for the control of the growth of weeds by pre or post emergence application which comprises the combined use of a isoproturon and or metoxuron and b Compound A at application rates of between 0.25 and 2 kg ha, and preferably between 0.75 and 2 kg ha, of each of a and b in proportions of 4 1 to 1 1, and preferably 2 1 to 1 1 of a to b , with or without a wetting agent to control a very wide spectrum of annual broad leafed weeds and grass weeds in cereal crops, e.g. wheat, barley, oats and rye, without significant permanent damage to the crop. The combined use described above offers both foliar and residual activity and consequently can be employed over a long period of crop development, i.e. from pre weed pre crop emergence to post weed post crop emergence. Applications made soon after emergence of both weed and crop give best results as this timing most effectively combines foliar and residual activity. Lower rates of application, for example from 0.25 to 0.75 kg ha of a isoproturon and or metoxuron and b Compound A in the proportions hereinbefore specified are generally suitable when application is made to broad leafed weeds and grass weeds at the seedling growth stage but higher rates of application, for example from 0.75 to 2.0 kg ha of a isoproturon and or metoxuron and b Compound A in the proportions hereinbefore specified are generally suitable when application is made to established broad leafed weeds and grass weeds, i.e. weeds which have matured beyond the seedling growth stage. By the term pre emergence application is meant application to the soil in which the weed seeds or seedlings are present before emergence of the weeds above the surface of the soil. By the term 1post emergence application is meant application to the aerial or exposed portions of the weeds which have emerged above the surface of the soil. By the term foliar activity is meant herbicidal activity produced by application to the aerial or exposed portions of the weeds which have emerged above the surface of the soil. By the term residual activity is meant herbicidal activity produced by application to the soil in which weed seeds or seedlings are present before emergence of the weeds above the surface of the soil, whereby seedlings present at the time of application or which germinate subsequent to application from seeds present in the soil, are controlled. Where Galium aparine is present in the emerged weed population of the locus of crop growth at which weeds are to be controlled by the combined use of isoproturon and or metoxuron and Compound A, this combined use should, as hereinbefore indicated, be associated with the use of a herbicide with good activity by postemergence application against that weed species. For this purpose, i.e. the control of the growth ofGalium aparine, the associated use of mecoprop optionally as an amine or metal, e.g. sodium or potassium, salt or ester thereof, at application rates of 0.5 to 2.0 kg a.i. ha in proportions of 1 2 to 4 1, and preferably 1 2 to 2 1, of total isoproturon and or metoxuron and Compound A mecoprop a.i. is particularly suitable and constitutes a preferred feature of the present invention.Alternatively, or in addition to mecoprop, Galium aparine may also be controlled by the associated use of dichloroprop i.e. 2 2,4dichlorophenoxy propionic acid and its metal, e.g. sodium or potassium, or amine salts or esters, dinoterb i.e. 2 tert butyl 4,6 dinitrophenol and its metal, e.g.sodium or potassium, ammonium or amine salts, bromoxynil i.e. 3,5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzonitrile and its metal, e.g. sodium or potassium, ammonium or amine salts or esters, in particular bromoxynil octanoate, ioxynil i.e. 4 hydroxy 3,5 di iodobenzonitrile and its metal, e.g. sodium or potassium, ammonium or amine salts or esters, in particular ioxynil octanoate, pyridate i.e. 6 chloro 3 phenylpyridazin 4 yl S octyl thiocarbonate , bentazone i.e. 3 isopropyl lH benzo 21l, 3 thiadiazin 4 one 2,3 dioxide or benazolin i.e. 4 chloro 2oxobenzothiazolin 3 ylacetic acid or its metal, e.g.sodium or potassium, ammonium or amine salts or esters, e.g. its ethyl ether. In accordance with usual practice, a tank mix may be prepared prior to use by combining separate formulations of the individual herbicidal components.

For example, whereas 1.0 kg a.i. ha of metoxuron is needed to control Polygonum lapathifolium, with the addition of only 0.25 kg a.i. ha of Compound A the amount of metoxuron needed to control this weed is reduced to 0.27 kg a.i. ha. In other words a combination of 0.25 kg a.i. ha Compound A and 0.27 kg a.i. ha metoxuron i.e. 0.52 a.i. ha total herbicide gives control equivalent to that achieved by 1.0 kg a.i. ha metoxuron or 0.74 kg a.i. ha Compound A when used in the absence of metoxuron. In contrast, the results obtained with chlortoluron and Compound A show an additive effect only. The following field experiments Experiments 3 to 5 show that the further combination with mecoprop in the form of a tank mix can give excellent control of a wide spectrum of grass and broad leafed weeds in cereal crops with substantial increases in crop yield by comparison with treatments comprising at least isoproturon as the active ingredient.EXPERIMENT 3Site 1 Southern EnglandCrop winter wheat Maris Hobbitt .Date sprayed mid December Machine a motorized small plot sprayer using 5 x 8002 tee jets each at 50 cm spacing at 30 p.s.i. 2.1 kgf cmê giving 248.2 l ha in low gear.Plots 2.5 x 5 m, x 3 replicates for each treatment.

The term homogeneously dispersed is used to include compositions in which the isoproturon and or metoxuron and Compound A are dissolved in the other components.The term herbicidal compositions is used in a broad sense to include not only compositions which are ready for use as herbicides but also concentrates which must be diluted before use. Preferably, the compositions contain from 0.05 to 90 by weight of isoproturon and or metoxuron and Compound A. The herbicidal compositions may contain both a diluent or carrier and a surface active e.g. wetting, dispersing, or emulsifying agent. Surface active agents which may be present in herbicidal compositions of the present invention may be of the ionic or non ionic types, for example sulphoricinoleates, quaternary ammonium derivatives, products based on condensates or ethylene oxide with nonyl or octyl phenols, or carboxylic acid esters of anhydrosorbitols which have been rendered soluble by etherification of the free hydroxy groups by condensation with ethylene oxide, alkali and alkaline earth metal salts of sulphuric acid esters and sulphonic acids such as dinonyl and dioctyl sodium sulphonosuccinates and alkali and alkaline earth metal salts of high molecular weight sulphonic acid derivatives such as sodium and calcium lignosulphonates. Examples of suitable solid diluents or carriers are aluminium silicate, talc, calcined magnesia, kieselguhr, tricalcium phosphate, powdered cork, adsorbent carbon black and clays such as kaolin and bentonite.
