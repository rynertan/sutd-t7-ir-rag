# Ink usage estimator.

## Abstract
An ink usage estimator signal 112, IUES is developed representing the amount of ink required to print on a receptive media a portion of an image which is on film, such as a color separation. A video signal VS representing the portion of the selected image is gated 100 by area pulses AP during periods of the video signal which define the selected portion of the image. The gated video signal AVS is averaged 200 to develop the ink usage estimator signal, which represents the amount of ink required to print the selected portion of the image.
