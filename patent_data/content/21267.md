## Description
IMPROVED ZEOLITE ION EXCHANGER Background of the Invention This invention relates to crystalline alumina silicates commonly called zeolites and used as builders for formulated detergents. In particular, our invention comprises a zeolite silicate agglomerate. Zeolites crystalline or partially crystalline alkali metal alumina silicates have been used to replace or partially replace phosphates in built laundry detergents as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,98 S,669 4,000,094 4,019,999 and 4,096,081. The prior art section of No. 4,096,081 describes many of the problems associated with the use of zeolites as builders in detergents. Inclusion of the granules of our invention as builders in detergent overcomes these problems.Some of these problems are 1 zeolite built detergents cannot be formulated with sufficient alkali metal silicate to realize the desirable detersive properties of the zeolites 2 zeolites of the proper particle size for detergent builders are free flowing, but present a severe dusting problem when being handled 3 high density and small particle size materials such as zeolites and silicates tend to segregate from dry blended mixtures upon handling and storage. Summary of the Invention Agglomerates that combine separate particles of hydrated zeolite and hydrated alkali metal silicate are found to exhibit an unexpected combination of properties which are of value in formulating dry blended detergents. The agglomerates are prepared by adding moisture and then heating a tumbling mixture of zeolite and silicate. Usually Zeolite NaA and sodium silicate are used. Tumbling is continued after moisture addition and heating have induced agglomeration, to consolidate and stabilize the particles. Screening and drying.to remove most of the added moisture complete preparation of the granules. The starting materials are of small particle size and are only marginally compatible with other detergent ingredients in dry blended detergent formulations. The product granules are of considerably larger particle size and lower density, which are desirable properties for the proposed use. Our granules also exhibit relatively small differences between the tamped and untamped bulk densities, which is a desirable characteristic of detergent ingredients.The product is also capable of adsorbing a significant level of compatible liquids, especially nonionic surfactants. Most importantly, we have also found that our particles disperse readily in water and provide high and very fast ion exchange capability. The prior art indicates consistently that zeolites and silicates when combined in the same granule or particle interact to form poorly dispersed materials with reduced calcium exchange capacity. Surprisingly, our agglomerates disperse rapidly and the calcium exchange capacity is about the theoretical value for Zeolite NaA. Usually the exchange capacities for zeolites are significantly less than the theoretical capacity. The Invention The alkali metal silicate powders or particles required as a raw material for the agglomerates of our invention may be obtained by spray drying, fluid bed drying or other equivalent method of drying sodium and or potassium silicate solutions. Spray drying is usually preferred because this process produces large quantities of relatively dense, small particles that are suitable for our process at reasonable cost. The SiO2 M20 mole ratio can be 1.4 to 4.0, whereinM stands for sodium, potassium or a combination thereof. We prefer to use sodium silicate that has 1.8 to 3.75 moles ofSiO2 per mole of No 20. The moisture content of the starting silicate particles is important and should be above about 15 . We prefer that the water content of the silicate particles be between 15 and 30 . A variety of synthetic and natural zeolites are useful as the second ingredient in our composition. We prefer synthetic zeolites since they can be prepared with the exact combination of properties desired. Sodium alumino silicates such as those described in U.S. PatentNos. 2,882,243 4 3,012,853 3,130,007 3,329,628 3,720,756 and 3,802,326 among others are useful. We usually use a zeolite that conforms to the formula Na AlO2 x SO y ZE2 In this formula, x and y are integers the molar ratio of x toy is in the range of 0.1 to 1.1 and z is an integer from about 8 to 250. In general, z is an integer such that the water content is between about 20 and 30 by weight of the zeolite. We prefer to use Zeolite NaA wherein x and y are 12 and z is about 20. Another useful zeolite has a composition wherein x is an integer between 80 and 96, y is an integer between 112 and 96, and z is between 220 and 270 representing a water content of about 18 to 30 . Zeolite NaA is the preferred starting ion exchange material. It is important that this material be hydrated.A ioss on ignition LOI of 19 to 25 by weight satisfies this requirement. The ultimate particle size of the ZeoliteNaA should be less than 10 microns. We prefer a particle size of 2 to 6 microns. While we have found that as little as 1 part by weight of silicate per 10 pbw of zeolite will form granular products, the desirable features of our composition are not fully realized unless at least about 1 pbw of the hydrated silicate is present for each 8 pbw of the hydrated zeolite. If less of the silicate is present the dispersion of the product in water is reduced and the rate of calcium exchange may be less than desired. The relative proportions of zeolite to silicate also appear to influence the amount of non ionic surfactant that the product will adsorb. Granules comprising 2 to 6 pbw of zeolite per 1 pbw of silicate adsorb nonionic surfactant efficiently. We prefer 3 to 6 pbw of zeolite per 1 pbw of silicate which provides granules of the highest adsorptivity for nonionics. The separate particulate components of our agglomerates can be blended in any convenient manner, but are usually tumbled in a drum or other revolving cylindrical container.After a uniform mixture of the particles is achieved tumbling is continued during moisture addition and heating.We define tumbling as keeping the mixture loose and in motion Maintaining said loose character often requires mechanical assistance to overcome the physical characteristics of the particule mixture, particularly during addition of moisture which must be distributed uniformly throughout the mixture. After moisture is added and any lumps have been eliminated, tumbling during heat application facilitates heat transfer and further moisture redistribution. Tumbling of this type requires that the particles be freely in motion without forcing or preventing contact between the particles. The motion causes repeated collisions and rolling among the particles so that as the silicate particles develop adherent surfaces, the particles stick together and eventually form into granules having survival strength. Finally, tumbling during cooling keeps the agglomerates freely in motion until any adherent character is lost by recooling and moisture dissipation. Tumbling of the desired nature may be obtained using revolving drum, pan, sphere or tube. For instance, a closed metal or plastic container might be partially filled with the dampened particle mixture and rotated horizontally while being heated externally with gas burners, hot air, heat lamps or by being submerged in a bath of heat transfer liquid. Lifts can be attached to the drum wall to facilitate tumbling, and the drum can be designed to eliminate in terior corners, or provided with knockers, to free or minimize material lodging where it could consolidate as chunks rather than free flowing granules. An open or continuous system of a similar nature can consist of a slightly inclined pipe or tube either rotating with lifts or non rotating with an internal screw to lift, tumble and convey through dampening, warming, shaping, recooling and redrying zones. Although both particulate materials are hydrated, additional water is required to initiate agglomeration. The particle mixture must be dampened with sufficient water to initiate granulation in order to produce the de sired product from the subsequent heating step. While the amount of water required will vary according to the com position of the particle mixture and the raw materials, the effective range of water addition is surprisingly narrow. Water additions of 15 to 35 pbw per 100 pbw of particle mixture are effective, and we prefer to use 16 to 30 pbw of water per 100 pbw of particle mixture. Less water reduces the yield of desirable granules while more water increases the density of the product to an unsatis factory level.The water can be introduced into the tumbling material by various means such as vapor from steam jets, water from a fine sprayer, sparger pipes or an intensifier bar and distributed throughout the mixture before heating begins. The dampened mixture is tumbled until agglomeration begins. The partially agglomerated material is passed through a relatively large screen larger particles are grated through the screen before the heating step. This screening helps prevent the forma tion of very large agglomerates. The now partially agglomerated particle mixture is tumbled as previously described in a closed container. The heat is applied to the particles indirectly through the walls of the container which are heated in any convenient manner the tumbling action serves to distribute heat throughout the mixture. The heating rate, the maximum temperature attained, the holding time at the maximum temperature and the rate of cooling depend upon the com position of the mixture and the characteristics desired in the final product. We obtain the product characteristics we desire by heating the particle mixture to a maximum temperature of 80 to 1300C at a rate of 4 to 150C per minute. The maximum temperature can be held 0 to 30 minutes while the agglomerates are cooled at 5 to 15 C minute. The agglomerates are screened the oversized materials are ground while the fines may be removed and recycled with the crushed oversized material to a fresh particle mixture.The fine material can also remain with the agglomerated material because further agglomeration may occur in the redrying step. The desired fraction is then dried by tumbling and heating the agglomerates. At least 70 of the moisture added to the particle mixture should ,be removed we prefer to remove 80 or more of the water added. Redrying serves to enhance the free flowing character of the product, and may increase its capacity to adsorb other ingredients. Ordinarily, the drying step should not remove more water than was used in the agglomeration step unless the product is to be used for some purpose other than as a builder for detergents. The material is screened again to remove any oversize materials that might form during the redrying step as well as any remaining fines to be recycled. The mechanism by which our agglomerate forms can be summarized as follows. The action of the added moisture and heat is to soften the surfaces of the alkali metal silicate by partial dissolving. The softening surfaces become adherent to the zeolite particles and gr anules are formed. As tumbling continues the granules become somewhat rounded and compacted. Finally, as tumbling continues and as the surfaces lose their adherent character through recooling and moisture dissipation, a free flowing granular product is realized. We prefer our product to have particles in the range of about 150 t6 2000 microns. The bulk density of detergent components is yery important. Our product has an untamped bulk density of about 0.30 to about 0.70 g cm3 and a tamped 3 bulk of about 0.33 to about 0.75 g cm these values are acceptable for detergent components. The relationship between the tamped and untamped bulk density is an important property, and the difference between the two values should be as small as possible. Our product has a very small difference between these two values. Dispersibility is also an important property and our product disperses in cool water in less than 15 seconds, compared to a time of several minutes for an accepted commer cial laundry product. The adsorption of nonionic surfactants is a very important property of our product and of detergent components.Our agglomerates adsorb up to 50 by weight of nonionic surfactants and remain free flowing. The actual amount of nonionic that our product can adsorb varies with the viscosity of the surfactant the more viscous materials are adsorbed to a greater extent than the more fluid materials. The com position of our granules has a very large influence on the amount of surfactant adsorbed. Granules that contain 1 pbw of zeolite per 1 pbw of silicate adsorb up to 25 of the surfactant. Granules of 2 and 4 pbw of zeolites per pbw of silicate adsorb 40 and 50 by weight of the nonionic, respectively. The product contains less than 5 water not originally associated with the zeolite or the silicate. Another very important property of our agglomerate is its calcium exchange capacity. It appears that the association of the zeolite and silicate in our product does not inhibit the calcium exchange capacity of the zeolite so that the theoretical capacity of the zeolite is achieved. The zeolite silicate agglomerate of our invention is useful for any applications that involve the combination.The product is most useful in formulating dry blended laundry detergents. Examples The following examples illustrate certain embodiments of our invention. These examples are not presented to establish the scope of the invention which is fully disclosed in the disclosure and the claims. The proportions are in parts by weight pbw or percent by weight unless otherwise indicated. The raw materials used in the examples were Britesil C24 hydrous sodium silicate 2.40 Six2 1.0 Na2O 23.8 Na2O 57.2 Six2 19.0 2 Zeolite NaA containing 21.5 H2O writesil is a registered trademark of PQ Corporation.Example 1 This example illustrates the preparation of an agglomerated product containing 2 pbw of Zeolite NaA and 1 pbw of silicate. Britesile C24 100 pbw and the Zeolite NaA 200 pbw were blended by mechanically assisted tumbling in an open container tilted at 45 from the horizontal. Tumbling was continued while 48 pbw of water were sprayed onto the mixture.Agglomeration was initiated by the water addition. The dampened mixture was screened so that it would pass through a 20 mesh screen. The screened material was transferred to a closed cylinder with tubular lifts that encourage tumbling action during horizontal rotation. The cylinder was rotated at 30 rpm and heated from 210C to a 1000C interior space temperature in 9 minutes. The interior temperature was then reduced to 350C in 10 minutes as rotating continued. The agglomerated material was discharged from the closed container and screened. The desired 10 to 65 mesh fraction was placed in an open container and tumbled while heating gently to remove 80 of the water added to initiate the agglomeration.A yield of about 65 of the desired 10 to 65 mesh product was obtained. The untamped bulk density was 32.1 lbs cu.ft.while the tamped value was 36.9 lbs cu.ft. Scanning electron micrographs show the Zeolite NaA particles to be coated on the relatively larger silicate particles both types of materials were finer than about 65 mesh before agglomeration.Example 2 This example illustrates the preparation of an agglomerate containing 1 pbw of Zeolite NaA and 1 pbw of the silicate. The zeolite 100 pbw was tumbled and 32 pbw of water was sprayed onto it. After the zeolite had become completely and uniformly dampened 100 pbw of Britesil was added quickly.Tumbling was continued until granulation was observed. The mixture was screened and the less than 20 mesh material placed in the closed container. The container was heated to 105 C in 6 minutes before recooling to 350C in 10 minutes. The preparation was completed as described in Example 1. Untamped and tamped bulk densities were 41.8 and 46.9 lb cu.ft., respectively.Example 3 This example illustrates a second preparation of an agglomerate containing 2 pbw of Zeolite NaA and 1 pbw of silicate. The preparation resulted in a greater yield of the desired particle size material of a lower bulk density. The zeolite 200 pbw was tumbled in the open container while 48 pbw of water was sprayed onto the powder.After the moisture was distributed uniformly, 100 pbw of the Britesil was added quickly to the tumbling material.Tumbling was continued until agglomeration was noticed, about 10 minutes. The loosely agglomerated material was passed through a 10 mesh screen and the smaller than lO mesh material placed in a drum that was at least 3 times the volume of the mixture. The drum had tubular lifts and was rotated at 30 rpm to produce the desired tumbling action. The sealed drum was heated to 1000C in 5 minutes and recooled to 350C in 10 minutes. The agglomerated material was then heated in an open container while tumbling gently to evaporate 80 of the moisture added to initiate agglomeration. The material was screened, and 88 of the product was found to be in the desirable range of 10 to 65 mesh with untamped and tamped bulk densities of 30.1 and 35.4 lbs cu.ft.Example 4 A preparation was run exactly as described in Example 3, except that only 43.5 pbw of water was used instead of 48 pbw. The yield of, 10 to 65 mesh product was reduced to 63 .Example 5 The preparation was carried out exactly as described in Example 3, except that 52.5 pbw of water was used instead of 48 pbw. The yield of the desired sized material was about the same as. in Example 3, but the bulk density was increased by about 1 3.Example 6 This example illustrates the process of preparing an agglomerate that contains 4 pbw of Zeolite NaA and 1 pbw of silicate. Zeolite NaA 400 pbw and Britesil C24 100 pbw were tumbled until uniformly mixed. Then 100 pbw of water was sprayed onto the mixture and tumbling was continued until some agglomeration was observed. The dampened mixture was passed through a 14 mesh screen and placed in the heating drum. The rotating drum was heated to 1000C in 8 minutes and recooled to 350C in 10 minutes. The agglomerated material was dried as previously described, to remove about 80 of the added moisture. The material was screened to provide the 10 to 80 mesh fraction. The untamped and tamped bulk densities were 40.2 and 45.4 lbs cu.ft., respectively.Example 7 The adsorption of nonionic surfactants by the products of our invention and the precursor materials was tested.A simple spotting test, ie., a surfactant transfer test, was developed in order to determine the adsorption capability of our zeolite silicate agglomerates. Five grams of the test agglomerates were weighed into an appropriate container at room temperature. A carefully weighed quantity of surfactant, heated to 50 C, was added to the granules. The mixture was agitated gently for 60 seconds using a spatula then the, mixture was placed in a compact heap on a piece of white paper. Ta test material remained in contact with the paper for 3 minutes and was then returned to the container, which was then sealed. The test was repeated after 60 minutes and after about 24 hours. The material was stored at room temperature 20 22 C during this time. Each surfactant was tested with the granules by preparing a series of samples with increased surfactant levels from one sample to the next e.g., 25 , 30 , 35 , 40 , etc. added surfactant. Sacurationw was considered to be that level at which the 24 hour sample produced distinct spotting. To facilitate observation of the spotting, a small amount of red dye was added to the surfactant 1 g of 0,58 solution of Rhodamine BX in isopropanol added to 25 g of the surfactant . The isopropanol does not influence the test, since it evaporates during sample preparation. At add on levels below saturation, spotting sometimes occurs immediately after the test specimens are prepared the spotting is more pronounced at levels close to saturation. The surfactants used in this test werenonionic ethoxylated linear alcohols supplied by Shell Chemical Co.under the trademark, NEODOLa. The surfactants used were NEODOLo 25 7 A nonionic surfactant consisting of an ethoxylated linear alcohol of C12, C13, C14 and C15 chain lengths with 7.2 ethylene oxide groups per mole of alcohol. The molecular weight is over 500, and the melting point is 18 20 C. NEODOLe 25 9 A similar nonion with 9 ethylene oxide groups per mole of alcohol, a molecular weight over 600 and a melting point of 25 280C. lIEODOLe 25 12 A similar nonionic with 12 ethylene oxide groups per mole of alcohol, a molecular weight of more than 700 and a melting point of 30 33 C. NEODOLs 45 7 A nonionic surfactant consisting of an ethoxylated linear alcohol of d and C15 chain lengths with 7 ethylene oxide groups per average mole of alcohol. The molecular weight is over 500 and the melting point is 2l 250C. Table 1 summarizes the maximum surfactant loadings maximum without spotting for examples of our agglomerate.

We tested the flowability of our granules and one commercial product as follows. A carefully weighed one ounce sample was placed in a 1.5 oz. polyethylene funnel 7mm. i.d. stem . The material was timed for complete emptying of the funnel. An average time for five runs was reported. The results are summarized in Table 2.

At saturation levels of surfactant loadings the granules cake and do not flow. Example 9 Quick and complete dispersibility of the zeolite in our agglomerate is very important to provide optimum detergency performance. Dispersibility was evaluated in a subjective manner by dropping about 0.1 g of the test material into about 50 ml of de ionized water at room temperature. No agitation was provided. Suddeniy, a cloudy white layer forms around the solids. The time at which this layer forms is considered the time of dispersion, since the agglomerates completely break up and disperse with gentle swirling upon fornation of the cloudy layer. The following tabulation shows the dispersion time range for several determinations for our product. 2 pbw Zeolite NaA l pbw silicate 4 15 sec. Example 1 4 pbw Zeolite NaA l pbw silicate 7 15 sec. Example 6 10 pbw Zeolite NaA l pbw silicate 180 sec.It is apparent that the 2 1 and 4 1 granules are far superior to the 10 1 material in speed of dispersion and may provide superior performance. A commercial laundry detergent was found to be poorly dispersible, taking more than several minutes to disperse.
