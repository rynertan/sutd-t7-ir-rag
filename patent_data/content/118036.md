## Description
BIOLOGICALLY ACTIVE KETONE DERIVATIVE, PREPARATION AND USE The present invention relates to a novel salt of 2 tert butyl amino 3 chloropropiophenone. 2 tert Butylamino 3, chloropropiophenone and the corresponding 3 fluoro analogue are described in our British Patent SpecificationNo. 1,340,032 which also broadly discloses the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of these bases, the salts of the following acids being specifically mentioned in the Specification, namely hydrochloric1 sulphuric, phosphoric and toluenesulphonic acids. As indicated in theSpecification, the above described compounds possess valuable anti depressant properties when tested by standard techniques used in the art for determining anti depressant activity, for example the tetrabenazine induced sedation test in rodents. It has been found that the compounds require much larger doses for stimulant action than for anti depressant action.The compounds are also not inhibitors of monoamine oxidase nor do they have a pressor effect. Of the two free bases and their salts mentioned above, the chloro analogue and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts have been found to have particularly advantageous antidepressant activity. As mentioned in the Specification, 2 tert butylamino 3 chloropropiophenone and its 3 fluoro analogue are moderately weak bases pKa about 8.5 9 and are desirably stored and administered as pharmaceutically acceptable salts, mineral acid salts and particularly the hydrochloride salt being mentioned for this purpose in the Specification. However, it has now been found that problems arise in the selection of suitable salts for use as therapeutic agents because of poor stability when prepared and stored in bulk and or when used to make pharmaceutical formulations. Thus, for example, from experiments which we have carried out, we have found that the following salts of 2 tert butylamino 3 chloropropiophenone are unstable upon storage, namely the salts of formic, fumaric, citric, phthalic and trifluoromethanesulphonic acids, as well as the phosphate monohydrate, hemisulphate sesquihydrate 1 methanesulphonate sesquihydrate, p toluenesulphonate monohydrate and napthalenesulphonate monohydrate salts. The propiophenone moiety breaks down into hydroxyketones, a diketone and meta chlorobenzoic acid.It is of course an important desideratum for a pharmaceutical product that it should have a reasonably good bulk stability in order to avoid or reduce wastage resulting from decomposition of the active moiety during the period between its synthesis and its use in formulating the final dosage form. A further problem is that the above mentioned salts of the base and also the hydrochloride have limited stability when formulated with conventional pharmaceutial carriers or excipients into solid compositions. It will be appreciated that, in order for the salts to be used in medical therapy, it is necessary to formulate them into pharmaceutical compositions suitable for administration to the patient.The formulation of such compositions entails the admixture or contacting of the salts with various pharmaceutical carriers or excipients. Examples of solid pharmaceutical compositions which are mentioned in BritishSpecification 1,340,032 are tablets1 cachets, capsules and suppositories. Of these various types of composition, tablets and capsules are particularly preferred forms as it is generally desired to administer the active compound by the oral route. However, from experiments which we have carried out, we have found that the hydrochloride salt of 2 tertbutylamino 3 chloropropiophenone has limited stability in the presence of conventional tableting excipients, particularly magnesium stearate and stearic acid which are commonly used as lubricants in tablet formulations. The formulation of the salts of the free base in capsules also presents problems because gelatin, which is commonly used to make the capsule shell, is hydrophilic and therefore creates a humid environment within the capsule, which has a deleterious effect on the 2 tert butylamino 3 chloropropiophenone salt present in the capsule.It will therefore be appreciated that considerable difficulty arose in finding a salt of 2 tert butylamino 3 chloropropiophenone which has sufficient stability when formulated in pharmaceutical compositions. We have now discovered that the maleate salt of 2 tert butylamino 3 chloropropiophenone has advantageous stability characteristics in association with conventional pharmaceutical carriers and excipients, particularly carriers or excipients which are commonly employed in the formulation of solid compositions such as tablets and capsules. A further advantage of the maleate salt is that it is much less corrosive than, for example, the hydrochloride salt which tends to corrode apparatus used in its preparation and formulation. A particular problem with the hydrochloride is that it tends to corrode tablet press die tables causing considerable economic disadvantage. According to one feature of the present invention therefore we provide 2 tert butylamino 31 chloropropiophenone maleate. The use of the maleate salt of 2 tert butylamino 3 chloropro piophenone enables one to present the base in a substantially stable form which can be relatively easily prepared, then stored in bulk for reasonable periods of time and or which can be formulated in pharmaceutical compositions particularly in solid compositions such as tablets and capsules, thereby avoiding the stability problems which, as discussed above, are associated with other salts. The maleate salt has been found to have good antidepressant activity when tested in the tetra benazine induced sedation test in rodents. According to a further feature of the present invention we provide 2 tert butylamino 3 chloropropiophenone maleate for use in the therapeutic treatment of a mammal, for example, for use in the treatment of depression in mammals, including man. The present invention also provides a method of treating depression in a mammal, including a human being1 which comprises administering to said mammal an effective dose of 2 tert butylamino3 chloropropiophenone maleate, for example in a form cf a pharmaceutical composition as hereinafter described. The present invention further provides a method of treating one or more of the following conditions in a mammal, including a human being, which comprises administering to said mammal a dose effective to treat said condition of 2 tert butylamino 3 chloropropiophenone maleate, for example, in a form of a pharmaceutical composition as hereinafter described 1 minimal brain dysfunction 2 tardive dyskinesia 3 mania 4 hypercholesterolemia 5 hyperprolactinemia and other conditions wherein reduced prolactin secretion is desirable, such as prolactin sensitive mammary cancer, galactorrhea, etc. 6 mental functional impairment caused by alcohol consumption and 7 functional impairment and drowsiness caused by the use of benzodiazepines. According to a further feature of the present invention we provide pharmaceutical compositions comprising, as active ingredient, 2 tert butylamino 3 chloropropiophenone maleate in association with at least one pharmaceutical carrier or excipient. Conveniently the said active ingredient comprises 5 to 95 by weight of the composition. The above described compositions according to the present invention are preferably presented in solid unit dosage forms for administration by the oral or rectal route1 e.g. in the form of tablets, cachets, capsules or suppositories. They may also be presented in solution or suspension for oral administration or in solution for parenteral administration. It is particularly preferred to present the maleate salt according to the present invention in an oral dosage unit preparation e.g. as a cachet, tablet or capsule containing one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers which may take the form of solid fillers or diluents such as lactose, starch such as corn, potato or rice starch, microcrystalline cellulose, as well as other excipients conventionally known in the pharmaceutical art for this purpose including binders, thickeners, lubricants, disintegrants, surfactants, buffers, sweetening and other flavouring agents, coloring agents, coatings and preservatives.As indicated above, a particularly preferred type of pharmaceutical composition for the administration of the maleate salt is the tablet comprising, in addition to the active ingredient, one or more of the above mentioned pharmaceutical carriers or excipients suitable for tablet formulations, for example, inert diluents such as lactose and corn starch, and or lubricants such as talc, hydrogenated vegetable oil, stearic acid, lubritab and magnesium stearate. Another preferred type of pharmaceutical composition is the capsule wherein the active ingredient optionally in admixture with one or more appropriate pharmaceutical carriers or excipients, e.g., selected from those described above, is presented in a capsule shell, for example, of gelatin. The gelatin capsule is preferably opaque and may be colored, generally being hard rather than soft gelatin. The formulation of the active ingredient as suppositories for rectal administration may be effected using conventional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers for this purpose such as cocoa butter. For the oral or rectal route of administration, the preferred dosage of the active ingredient calculated as the base is about 0.25 mgikg to 5 mg kg of mammal body weight while the most preferred dosage calculated as the base is about 0.75 mg kg to 3.5 mgikg of mammal body weight. The active ingredient is preferably administered 3 times daily although the number of daily administrations of the medication may vary according to the subject mammal being treated, the nature of the formulation and the exercise of the physician s discretion. For the treatment of humans, the preferred unit dosage of the active ingredient calculated as the base for oral administration, or administration as a suppository, is about 15 to 500 mg with the more preferred unit dosage being about 35 to 250 mg, and the most preferred unit dosage being about 40 to 150 mg. The compositions of the present invention may be prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy but all methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier or excipient. In general the compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the ingredients. This may be achieved by simple admixture but preferably involves granulation, dry or wet, in the latter instance with readily available liquids such as water or alcohol. The granules with or without compaction may then be compressed or molded into tablets or suppositories, or filled into capsules or cachets.Suppositories may also be made by melting the required base, e.g. the cocoa butter, mixing in the active ingredient, and molding the mixture or allowing it to solidify, powdering or granulating this and then compressing the powder or granules into the suppository. Other formulations suitable for oral administration include powders and granules a bolus, electuary or paste a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or a non aqueous liquid and an oil in water or water in oil liquid emulsion. The active ingredient may also be administered by the parenteral including subcutaneous, intradermal, intramuscular and intravenous route. Formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous and non aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti oxidents, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic t, with the blood of the intended recipient and aqueous and non aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents. The formulations may be presented in unit dose or multi dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze dried lyophilized condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injections1 immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described. When administered by the parenteral route the required dosage of the active ingredient calculated as the base will generally be ne nalf cf that indicated sura as appropriate for oral administraticn. Preferred unit dosage preparations are those containing a unit dosage, as hereinabove recited, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of the active ingredient. The compositions of the present invention as above described may optionally contain other therepeutic agents to complement and or supplement the activity of the maleate salt. 2 tert Butylamino 3 chloropropiophenone maleate may be prepared in conventional manner, for example by analogous procedures to those described in British Patent Specification, 1,340,032. In principle, the two preferred methods of preparing the maleate are a metathesis in solution or suspension of another salt of the base with maleic acid or a functional equivalent thereof or b treatment of the free base in solution or suspension with maleic acid or a functional equivalent thereof. sic With regard to process a , this may be conveniently effected by reacting the other salt of the base with maleic acid in a solvent medium, preferably in an aqueous medium. The reaction is preferably effected at a temperature of about 25 300C. The initial salt of the base is preferably the hydrochloride in view of its ease of preparation as described in British PatentSpecification 1,340,032. The maleic acid employed in this process is preferably obtained by hydrolysis of maleic anhydride in order to avoid contamination with the geometrically isomeric fumaric acid. Hydrochloric acid liberated in this process may be neutralised by the addition to the reaction mixture of an appropriate amount of a base, e.g. an alkali metal hydroxide such as sodium hydroxide, for example to adjust the pH of the reaction mixture to about 2. With regard to process b , this may be conveniently effected by reacting the base with maleic acid in a solvent medium, e.g., in an aqueous or more preferably an organic solvent medium1 for example, comprising one or more organic solvents selected from aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene and alkanols such as ethanol. As in process a above, it is preferred to obtain maleic acid by hydrolysis of maleic anhydride. In both of processes a and b the maleic acid is advantageously employed in an approximately equimolar amount with respect to the base. The base or salt thereof employed as starting material in processes a and b may be prepared as described in British PatentSpecification 1,340,032 and, if desired, formation of the maleate salt in accordance with the present invention may be effected without isolation and or purification of the intermediate base or salt A particularly preferred method described in the said BritishPatent Specification for the preparation of the base or a salt thereof comprises the reaction of a compound of formula I EMI11.1 wherein Hal is chloro, bromo or iodo with tert butylamine and, if desired, converting the resulting product to an acid addition salt thereof. The above mentioned reaction is slow in the absence of solvent since tert butylamine normally reacts very slowly with 2 halopropiophenones.It is desirable to include an organic solvent in the reaction mixture, and for this purpose acetonitrile offers marked advantages. It improves the kinetics of the reaction, is unreactive under the conditions used and is relatively low boiling. Other polar solvents, protic or aprotic, may be used, for example lower aliphatic ketones i.e. those having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms in each alkyl group or ethers, but the reaction is slow in these solvents. Others which may be used include dimethylform amide, dimethylacetamide, nitromethane, dimethylsulphoxide and hexamethyl. phosphoramide. It may be desirable to heat the reactants, for example at the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture. The amine is preferably present in excess relative to the compound of formula I up to five times the equimolar quantity may be used. If Hal in formula I is chloro, then a catalytic amount of an iodide salt, for example sodium iodide may be included with advantage in the reaction mixture. The following Examples illustrate the present invention, but should not be taken to in any way constitute a limitation thereof. EXAMPLE I 2 tert Butylamino 3 chloropropiophenone hydrochloride 83 g, 0.3 mole was dissolved in 0.5 L of water and an equimolar quantity of aqueous sodium hydroxide was added.
