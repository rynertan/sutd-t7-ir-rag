# Electrochemical organic synthesis.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to an electrochemical process for synthesising carboxylic acids by reduction of gaseous oxides of carbon in which a gas transfer electrode is used as the cathode. The gas transfer electrodes are preferably used as hydrophobic gas transfer electrodes. In carrying out the process it is particularly preferred to use porous, hydrophobic gas transfer electrodes made from an electrocatalyst eg carbon, bound in a polymer such as polyethylene or polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE . In the case of some reactions another electro catalyst may be added to the carbon polymer mixture. The process is particularly suited to producing acids such as formic acid and oxalic acid.
