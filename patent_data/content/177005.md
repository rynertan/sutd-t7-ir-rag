# EYE EXAMINING APPARATUS

## Abstract
An eye examining apparatus is disclosed which is capable of the accurate detection of any abnormality in the optical system of a patient s eye which might exist at any position of the eye, and also which is capable of providing easy measurement of the degree of refration of the patient s eye. The apparatus comprises a target projecting system for projecting onto a retina a target image to be measured focalizing means for detecting the focus of the target to be measured and for focalizing it on the retina and an optical transfer function measuring system for detecting the con trast of the target image to be measured, which is focalized on the retina, and thereby measuring the optical transfer function of the patient s eye. The apparatus may further comprise means for compar ing the measured optical transfer function with that of a normal eye, and the target projecting system may include a means for rotating the target image to be measured around an optical axis.
