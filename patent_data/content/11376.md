# Photoelectric densitometer system.

## Abstract
A densitometer system has a three colour channel densitometer head 103 which is scanned across a sheet 707 bearing colour swatches. By suitably instructing the system computer from a console 715 reference optical densities are stored in a memory together with tolerance limits, and the measured optical densities are compared with these and the results shown on a video display 713 . Marks on the sheet may be inserted to instruct the computer as to the position of swatches to be measured. The reference values may be inserted by reading optical densities from a reference swatch bar. For accurate positioning of the sheet a channel 705 contains a pair of sighting wires positioned above the path of the densitometer head.
