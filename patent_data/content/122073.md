# Intramolecular polymer complexes viscosifiers for high ionic strength drilling fluids.

## Abstract
A new family of terpolymers based on acrylamide sodium styrene sulfonate methacrylamidopropyltrimethylammonium chloride has been found to be an improved viscosity control ad ditive for water bases drilling muds. The resultant muds dis play good viscosity characteristics, thermal stability and gel strength when formulated from the terpolymer intramolecular complex having the appropriate polymer concentration and salt level.
