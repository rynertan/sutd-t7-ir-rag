# SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR AUTOMATICALLY MONITORING AND MAINTAINING DESIRED CONCENTRATIONS OF METAL PLATING BATHS

## Abstract
A system for the automatic, on line analysis and control of additives in chemical processing solutions in manufactur ing processes is disclosed. The automatic control system embodiment includes a sensing system such as measuring a cell 10 in which appropriate sensors are located. For electrochemical mea surements, a three electrode cell with a rotating disk sensor is employed to control agitation of the sample solution. Other sensors on electrodes are used to measure pH and a thermometer is provided to monitor temperature. The sensing process, like the sampling process, is automatically controlled by a controller 18 . The system, in addition to the sensing means and con troller, further includes a plating tank 20 , a mixing tank 22 , a pump or control valve 24 and a reservoir 26 . The measuring cell 10 may be disposed in the bath in a stan dard plating tank in which the plating bath solution is con tained. Alternatively, a flow through tank may be used in which the plating solution may flow into and from as desired. When the sensing means so determines, a replenish ment bath from the reservoir can be pumped into the mixing tank by means of the pump or control valve means under the command of signals from the controller which in turn re ceives output signals from the measuring cell.
