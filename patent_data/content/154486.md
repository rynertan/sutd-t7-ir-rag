# Acrylic polymer composition for fixing metal sheets.

## Abstract
A fixing composition comprises an acrylic copolymer of 80 99.5 wt of an akyl meth acrylate of average 2 12 C atoms per alkyl moitey and 20 0.5 of a copolymerizable monomer having a functional group optionally an adhesion imparting resin e.g. a terpene phenol resin is included in amount of 0.1 to 100 parts 100 parts of copolymer. The polymer is formed by reaction in organic solvent for the composition. The composition has a 10 second shear creep compliance of 0.1 to 30 10 ⁶ cm² dyne and has at least 30wt of non volatile material. A sheet of 0.5 5mm thick of a powdered metal alloy e.g. a multi component eutectic alloy and a pressure sensitive adhestve composition, e.g. the acrylic copolymer, is placed on a metal substrate e.g. of steel a film or coated layer of 5 50mm thickness of the fixing composition is placed therebetween. The assembly is heated to 150 400 C for at least 5 minutes to form a tarry adhesive from the fixing composition, and is then further heated to sintering tempera ture, e.g. 1000 1,150 C at which the adhesive vaporises and the alloy sinters to the substrate.
