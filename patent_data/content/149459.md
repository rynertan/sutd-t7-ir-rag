# Stabilized fluid suspension of antiparasites in unchlorinated organic solvents and process for the preparation and use thereof.

## Abstract
Stabilized antiparasitic fluid suspensions are prepared in unchlorinated organic solvents for mixing and or milling of Chlorotriazine and or herbicide substituted Ureas insoluble in such organic solvents, stabilizing the suspension with special pyrogenic micronized and or hydrated and or treated silica, possibly adjuvated by the presence of organophilic bentonites, together with emulsifiers and or dispersing agents, with the possible presence of Acetanilides and or herbicide substituted Nitroanilines, dissolved in the organic solvents used. These fluid suspensions are used for selective deweeding of agricultural crops and total deweeding of uncultivated areas.

## Description
STABILI7ED FLUID SUSPENSION OF ANTI PARASITES IN UNCHLORINATED ORGANIC SOLVENTS AND PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION AND USE THEREOF ooooo Fluid suspensions of antiparasitics are known since long, They are generally prepared as suspensions in aqueous means containing various adjuvants and stabilizers. But suspensions of chiorotriazine in chlorinated organic solvents are also known, in which herbicide acetanilides are dissolved , and, thanks to the high specific weight of these solvents, similar to that of the suspended chlorotriazine, they may be fluidly and stably obtained in these organic solvents, without the need for stabilizers and suspending agents. With the present invention, it was unexpectedly found that a fluid suspension of chlorotriazine and or herbicide substituted ureas may be prepared in unchlorinated organic solvents, if these suspensions are stabilized with special pyrogenic micronized and or hydrated and or treated silica, together with emulsifiers and or dispersing agent, with the possible presence of acetanilides and or herbicide substituted nitroanilines soluble in the organic solvents used. Organophilic bentonites may also be added to these stabilizing silica and act as adjuvants. According to the invention, the following are some of the possible advantages 1 Possibility of obtaining stable fluid suspensions, with stability of active substances normally unstable in aqueous suspension.2 Possibility of mixing acetanilides and herbicide substituted nitroanilines, soluble in unchlorinated organic solvents and not water suspensible, with chlorotriazine and substituted ureas unsoluble but suspensible in such organic solvents.3 Possibility of using, for these compositions, solvents with lower toxicity than chlorinated hydrocarbons, with equally high flashpoint. The silica suitable for use as stabilizers of fluid suspensions of antiparasitics in organic solvents are hiehly microni ej silica, produced with various processes for physical or chemical treatment, to obtain pyrogenic and or hydrated and or treated silica with high suspensive capacity in unchlorinated organic solvents.

The production process first involves the mixing, in special mixers for fluids, of the organic solvents with any active substances in solution, if required3 the emulsifiers dispersing agents and sta bilizing silica are then dispersed by agitation and finally the solid active substances, already in fine powder, are added to be put in suspension. If the solid active substances in suspension do not possess a fineness under 20 micron, it is advisable to mill the fluid suspension in a sand or pearl mill in such a way that all the solid particles in suspension have fineness under 20 microns, and, for at least 50 in weight, with fineness under 10 microns. The fluid suspensions thus obtained , according to the invention, are particularly suitable for use in the fight against parasites, in some cases in their present state, but generally after dilution in suitable quantities of water for a subsequent improved dusting or pulverization, by means of conventional equipment operating on the ground, or even with aerial means.
