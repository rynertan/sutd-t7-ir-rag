# Conveyor device.

## Abstract
A conveyor device for sheet like or web like materials, containing two pairs of conveyor rollers 24, 26 and 25, 27 disposed with their axis parallel to one another, each pair comprising two co operating conveyor rollers, one of which is deformable 26, 27 and the other nondeformable 24, 25 . A non deformable drive roller 21 is maintained in contact with the deformable conveyor roller 26, 27 of each pair by means of pressing means 28, 29 which press each deformable con veyor roller against the associated non deformable conveyor roller 24, 25 and against the drive roller 21 in a direction sitauted in the plane of the bisector of the dihedral angle between the plane through the axes of the drive roller and deformable conveyor roller and the plane through the axes of the deformable conveyor and the associated non deformable conveyor roller. As a result the speed of conveyance of the pairs of rollers is independent of the pressure applied and the hardness of the surface of the rollers used and practially independent of the diameters of the rollers.
