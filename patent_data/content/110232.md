## Description
AERODYNAMICAL ANTI SOLING BAFFLE OF IMPROVED TYPEFOR A REAR WINDOW OF A VEHICLE The present invention relates to an aerodynamical anti soiling baffle of improved type for the rear window of a vehicle. It is known that the vehicles with a truncated tail for example the two box motor vehicles and or the station wagon motor vehicles have rear windows which are almost vertical or aniway little inclined i.e. form with the lower vertical an angle of less than 450 and which, because of the formation of vortexes and aerodynamical windages at the tail portion of the vehicle, are soiled during the travel on muddy or snow covered roads. This soiling is undesirable inasmuch as it is not only antiaestlietic, but also reduces and or eliminates the rear visibility with the consequent danger of enhancing the accidents.The use of rear window wipers does not resolve the problem, because in this way only a limited zone of the rear window is cleaned. Therefore, aerodynamical baffles have been adopted consisting of a fixed tab which is installed at a point corresponding to the rear side of the body ceiling of the vehicle, at a predetermined distance from the surface of this latter. In this way, the tab creates a channel effect which directs a flow of scavenging air tangentially with respect to the rear window, thereby removing the particles of dirt before they may settle on the surface of the rear window itself. The baffles described hereinabove have the disadvantage consisting in that they increase the aerodyna mical resistance to the movement of the vehicle by about 10 15 , thus increasing the consumption of fuel and the costs of operation. This disadvantage resuls in being more serious, since the said devices, being fixed, act also when their action is not required, thus giving rise to a useless scavenging flow even in the absence of precipitations. It is an object of the present invention to provide an aerodynamical anti soiling baffle for the rear window in a vechicle, of the type described hereinabove but free from the mentioned disadvantages. In partiocular it is an object of the present invention to provide a baffle which will produce only a reduced increase of the aerodynamical resistance and which will operate only in case of necessity. These objects are attained by the present invention which provides and aerodynamical anti soiling baffle For the rear window of a vehicle, of the type apt to be installed in a position corresponding to a rear side of a body ceiling of the said vehicle and comprising a curved baffle tab, a leading edge of which is disposed parallel to the said body ceiling at a predetermined distance from this latter, and a rear edge of which is disposed parallel to the said rear window at a predetermined distance from this latter, characterized in comprising means for moving the said baffle tab from an extracted position, in which the said leading and rear edges are at the said predetermined distance from the said body ceiling and from the said rear window, to a retracted position in which the said leading edge is substantially tangential to the said body ceiling, and for moving the said baffle tab from the said retracted position to the said extracted position. For a better understanding of the present invention, two non limiting embodiments thereof will now be described with reference to the annexed drawings, in which FIGURE 1 is a perspective view of a detail of a baffle according to the teachings of the present invention FIGURE 2 and 3 are diagrammatical representations of two different working positions of the detail shown in Fig. 1 FIGURE 4 shows a baffle realized in accordance with the teachings of the present invention and FIGURE 4 shows a variant of the baffle shown in Fig. 4. Referring to Fig. 4, there is diagrammatically illustrated I lustrated a body ceiling l of a vehicle not shown, provided, at a position corresponding to a rear side 2 of the body ceiling 1, with a rear door 3, shown diagrammatically, having a transparent rear window 4. The door 3 is provided with an aerodynamical antisoiling baffle 5 mounted in a position corresponding to the side 2 for protecting the rear window 4 during the travel of the vehicle and comprising a baffle tab 6 supported by tho or more brackets 7, only one of which is shown, rigidly connected to the rear window 4 and or to the door 3, and to.which the tab 6 is hinged by means of a min 8. Referring also to Fig. 1, the tab 6 is disposed parallel to the side 2 in a position corresponding to this latter, is entirely supported by the door 3, is rectilinear and has a length substantially equal to the width of the body ceiling 1. Seen in cross section perpendicularly to the side 2, the tab 6 has a substantially Y shaped cross section, comprising a substantially flat leading portion 9 extending towards the body ceiling 1 and defined by opposed curvilinear lower and upper surfaces 10 and 11, respectively, and two rear appendixes 12 and 13 which converge towards the base and form an acute angle between them. The leading portion 9 is provided with a rounded leading edge 14 of aerodynamical anchorage, towards which converge the opposed surfaces 10 and 11, and with a rear end 15 opposed to the edge 14, from which depart the two appendixes 12 and 13. Appendix 13 extends beneath the portion 9 and is defined at the lower part by a curved surface 16, substantially parallel to the rear window 4, radiused to the surface 10 appendix 13 terminates with a rounded rectilinear rear edge 18 parallel to the rear window 4, which, according to the representation in Fig. 4, is hinged to the pin 8 so as to constrain the entire tab 6 to the brackets 7. Appendix 12 is delimited by curved opposed surfaces 19 and 20 lying in the same plane of the respective surfaces 10 and 11 and radiused to these latter without gaps the surfaces 19 and 20 are convergent at the rear part and terminate by forming a rounded rear edge 21 parallel to the edge 18 and lying in a plane substantially tangential to the leading edge 14.In order to inc rease the stiffness of the tab 6, appendixes 12 and 13 are connected to one another by means of a plurality of transversal ribs 22, only one of which is visible in Fig. 1. Preferably, tab 6 is formed by moulding, in one piece, in a synthetic plastic resin, so as to result in having a moderate weight. The brackets 7 support, besides the tab 6, a motor or any other type of electric actuator 23 apt to rotate the tab 6 about a pin 8 in the direction indicated by the arrows in Fig. 4 the brackets 7 project perpendicularly from the rear window 4, so that the tab 6 is apt to.rotate about an axis parallel to the side 2 and coinciding with the rear edge 18, i.e. with the axis of the pin 8. Motor 23 is controlled by the user of the vehicle by means of an electric circuit fed by a positive pole 25 and provided with a control switch 26 of any known type, disposed in a known and not shown manner inside the vehicle provided with the baffle 5, for example on the dashboard of the vehicle. By actuating the motor 23 the user can rotate the said tab 6 from inside the vehicle, displacing it from the position shown by a continuous line in Fig. 4, to the position shown by a dashed line in the said Fig. 4, or viceversa. Fig. 5 shows a variant 28 of the baffle of Fig.4. Parts similar or equal to those already described herein are indicated by the same reference numerals. The baffle 28 shown in Fig. 5 is installed on a rear door 3 of a vehicle 29, in particular a motor vehicle, of which for the sake of simplicity only a rear portion 30 in shown. The door 3 is hinged parallely to the rear side 2 of the body ceiling 1 of the vehicle 29 and is provided with a rear window 4. The baffle 28 comprises a baffle tab 6a, completely similar in every detail to the tab 6 described in the foregoing, disposed parallel to the side 2 and supported by the door 3.The only difference between the tab 6a and the tab 6 consists in that the tab 6a has opposite terminal ends 31 which, contrarywise to the homonymous ends of the tab 6 shown in Fig. 1, are provided, in one piece, with respective lateral arms 32, angularly rigidly connected to the said ends 31 and, consequen tly, to the tab 6a, which arms are apt to be hinged in the lower part at 33 on the door 3 at the base of the rear window 4 in addition, the edge 18 of the appendix 13 of the tab 6a is free, since it is not hinged to any pin 8. In this way, the tab 6a of the baffle 28 may rotate in the direction of the arrows Fig. 5 about an axis parallel to the side 2 and situated at the base of the rear window 4, between a first position shown by full lines in Fig. 5 and a second position shown by dashed lines in the same Figure.The displacement of the tab 6a can be carried out manually by the user, by loosening and then tightening again a stop device of a known type and not shown, situated at 33 and arranged to lock the arms 32 in any determined angular position relative to the rear window 4, or, preferably, is control led by the user, in a known and not shown manner, from inside the vehicle 29, by means of a tie rod 34 supported by the door 3 and coming out from this latter in a position corresponding to its upper end tie rod 34 may be controlled electrically by means of an actuator, not shown, instaled inside the door 3, or mechanically bowden control . In use, however the fastening and the control of the tab 6 or 6a are carried out, baffle 5 or 28 is apt to cause tab 6 or 6a, on control by the user, to assume two working positions shown in Figures 2 and 3. In Fig. 2 the tab 6a or 6 is shown diagrammatical ly in a retracted position, corresponding to the position shown by dashed lines in Figures 4 and 5.In this retracted position the edge 14 is substantially tangential to the body ceiling 1 and, in the case of the tab 6a, whose rotation takes place at a point far from the rear edge 18, this latter results in being substantially tangential to the rear window 4. In this way, a flow of air 35 produced by the movement forward of the vehicle and movable parallelly to the ceiling 1 cannot penetrate beneath the tab 6 or 6a , but is intercepted by the edge 14 and deflected along the upper surfaces 11 of the portion 9 and 20 of the appendix 12. Thanks to the configuration and orientation of this latter, the flow 35 is deflected far from the rear window 4 which has a limited inclination, thereby limiting the formation of vortexes 36 at the tail portion of the vehicle.I.e., appendix 12 acts in a manner analogous to that of negatively lifting baffles of known type, thus increasing the aerodynamical elonga tion of the vehicle, even in has a truncated tail rear portion, thereby reducing the aerodynamical resistance to the travel of the vehicle. In Fig. 3 the tab 6 or 6a is shown diagrammatically in an extracted or working position, corresponding to that shown by full lines in Figures 4 and 5 in this position the edges 14 and 18 are disposed in the upper part and parallel to do the body ceiling 1 and the rear window 4 at a predetermined distance from these latter, so as to define respective inlet and outlet edges of an aerodynamical channel 37 apt to separate from the flow 35 a scavenging flow 38, which is guided by the surfaces 10 and 16 and is deflected, thanks to the configuration and position of the appendix 13, into the rear window 4 tangentially to this latter. In this way, the flow 38, by lapping the rear window 4 prevents it from being soiled by removing the eventual contaminating particles which are present on the glass before thay may deposit on this latter.At the same time, appendix 12 continues to perform an aerodynamical action of detaching a part of the flow 35 from the surface of the body ceiling 1 thereby moving it away from the rear window 4 and thus reducing the formation of vortexes 36. In this extracted position the formation of vortexes 36 is increased relative to the retracted position shown in Fig. 2, and consequently there is obtained an increase of the aerodynamical resistance to the advancement of the vehicle, but thanks to the appendix 12 the said increase is of a minimum value and undoubtedly much smaller than that which would generated by a fixed baffle of conventional type. Experimental tests have proved that such resistance increase is in the order of 2 Ta 5 , i.e. decidedly lower than the value of 10 15 which is reached at the present time. Therefore, when the weather conditions are good, the user operates the controls 26 or 34 so as to cause the tab 6 or 6a, respectively to rotate about the pin 8 or 33, respectively so as to bring it to the retracted position of Fig. 2. In this position there is no increase of the aerodynamical resistance due to the presence of the baffle or 28 , but on the contrary, if the appendix 12 is well profiled, a reduction of the resistance to the advancement of the vehicle is obtained. In case of adverse weather conditions which render it necessary to clean the rear window 4, the user rotates the tab 6 or 6a by operating the controls 26 or 34 and brings it to the extracted position shown inFig. 3.In this position a scavenging flow 28 is formed which laps the rear window 4, whilst the appendix 12 allows to keep whithin minimum values the unavoidable increase of resistance to the advancement of the vehicle. Finally, from the foregoing it is clear that variations and modifications can be made to the present invention without departing from the scope of the invention itself. In particular, it is obvious that the baffle tab can be mounted by any means and in any manner other than those described hereinabove by way of examples, and can be actuated by means of different devices, or automatically, by means of a suitable sensor. Moreover, tha baffle described hereinabove may be mounted not only on two box vehicles, but also on three box vehicles in this case it is installed directly on the body ceiling of the vehicle and avoids the soiling of the rear window which, in such vehicles, cannot be provided with a wiper.
