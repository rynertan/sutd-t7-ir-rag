# Moulding machine.

## Abstract
A moulding machine for die casting, injection mould ing, and other similar processes, comprises a base 2 shaped to support thereon a two part die 3 and a ram 46 for converging and diverging the die halves between open and closed positions. A pair of clamping frames 5, 6 are privotally mounted on one end of the base, and include a closed border 7 shaped to surround or receive therein side portions of the die halves. The clamping frames are laterally pivoted between a fanned apart or open position wherein the die can be freely lifted off the base, and a folded or closed position wherein the frame borders surround the die side portions and capture the same between the ends of the frames in the closed position, retractable compression col umns 8 extend between the die and one end of the frames to positively lock the die halves in the closed position, whereby die separation forces developed during injection of the die are resisted substantially solely by the clamping frames. The die halves 120, 121 are mounted for longitudi nal movement on rails 14, 15 one only of which has a longitudinal rib 22 which mates with grooves in the die halves to align the die halves with one another while allow ing differential lateral thermal expansion of the die halves.
