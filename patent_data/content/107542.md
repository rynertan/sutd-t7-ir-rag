# Method for making aromatic bis etherimide s.

## Abstract
A method is provided for making aromatic bis ether imide s by effecting reaction between an aromatic bisphenox ide salt and a nitro substituted N alkyl phthalimide in the pres ence of a non polar organic solvent and an effective amount of a phase transfer catalyst. There is utilized as the phase trans fer catalyst, a mixture of a dipolar aprotic solvent and a poly valent metal salt such as zinc chloride.
