# Electrochemical device.

## Abstract
An electrochemical device comprising at least one electrochemical cell having a planar solid electrolyte body, and a first and a second electrode one of which is disposed on the solid electrolyte body. The device has a measure ment gas space communicating with an outside space for introducing a measurement gas, and a reference gas space into which a reference gas is introduced. The first and second electrodes are exposed to the measurement gas and refer ence gas spaces, respectively. The measurement gas is introduced into the measurement gas space with a diffusion resistance to molecules of a selected component of the measurement gas. The measurement gas and reference gas spaces are juxtaposed in spaced apart relation with each other in substantially the same plane parallel to the planar solid electrolyte body. The device may include two elec trochemical cells, one serving as a sensing cell having said first and second electrodes, and the other serving as a pumping cell having two electrodes one of which is exposed to the measurement gas space. A heating layer may be disposed on the side of the sensing cell. In this case, the first and second electrodes are spaced from each other in the direction parallel to the solid electrolyte body.
