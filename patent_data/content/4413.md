# Sheet feed apparatus and method.

## Abstract
Apparatus to feed sheets one at a time from a stack comprises a separator 10 , rotating about a plane substantially normal to the stack 30 . The separator rotation axis is tiltable in a first direction to contact the stack on one side to shingle the stack and move the top sheet rearwardly from under a restraint 51 and in a second direction to contact the stack on the other side to restore the stack to its unshingled state and move the top sheet over the restraint to a sheet feed roller 52 .
