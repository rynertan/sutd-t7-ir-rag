# Bearing for linear motion.

## Abstract
A linear motion bearing used for guiding portions which perform a linear motion such as a machine tool table and a positioning table. A circulation path of balls 8, 28 is formed using a two part split tube 3,3 of opposed J shape, or by combination of a two part split tube 23a of opposed U shape having a belt like connection 23c with a two part split tube 23b of opposed J shape, thereby facilitating machining and assembly and attaining reduction of the number of parts.
