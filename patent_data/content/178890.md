# A proces for preparing a carbon fiber of high strength.

## Abstract
A carbon fiber of high strength is disclosed, each filament of which is substantially circular in its cross section but has circumferential ruggedness which extends in parallel to an axis of the filament to form pleats. The ruggedness has a depth of more than 0.1 Âµm. The carbon fiber is prepared by extruding a spinning solution of an aqueous polyacrylonitrile pure zinc chloride solution of a specified polymer content into a coagulating bath at a specified draft ratio, followed by washing, drying and stretching at a total stretching ratio of 10 20 folds to form a precursor which is then subjected to conventional stabilizing and carbonizing steps.
