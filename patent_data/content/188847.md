1. Process for the preparation of 4,4 disubstituted cyclohexadienones of which at least one of the 4 substituents is fluorine characterised by reacting a compound of formula wherein X represents a hydrogen or halogen atom or an alkyl group, each R independently represents a halogen atom or, an alkyl, alkoxy, cyano or optionally substituted amino group, Z represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl, acyl or aryloxycarbonyl group, and n is 0 to 4, with hydrogen fluoride and a Pb IV compound, in the presence of a compound which acts as a base towards HF.

## Description
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of 4,4 disubstituted cyclohexadienones of which at least one of the 4 substituents is fluorine, and to the 4,4 disubstituted cyclohexadienones thus prepared. A process for the preparation of an unsubstituted 4,4 difluorocyclohexadienone is known from I.Ya. Aliev, I.N. Rozhkov and I.L. Knunyants, According to the invention there is provided a process for the preparation of 4,4 disubstituted cyclohexadienones of which at least one of the substituents is fluorine, characterised by reacting a compound of formula X preferably represents hydrogen, chlorine or methyl. When X in the starting material of formula I represents hydrogen or fluorine, the 4,4 disubstituted dione product is a 4,4 difluorocyclohexadienone. However, when X represents another halogen atom or an alkyl group, this atom or group is retained in the reaction product, thus yielding a 4 fluoro 4 X cyclohexadienone. The compounds thus prepared therefore may be represented by formula II Wherever in this application mention is made of alkyl groups, they are preferably C The group OZ may be an OH group the compound of formula I being a phenol , an alkoxy group the compound formula I being a phenol ether , an acyloxy group a phenol ester , or an aryloxycarbonyloxy group a phenyl aryl carbonate . The aryl moiety of the aryloxy group is preferably a phenyl group. The substituent Z preferably represents a hydrogen, acetyl or phenoxycarbonyl group. It has been found that yields obtained with unprotected phenols Z H can sometimes be improved by derivatizing the phenolic group with one of the protective groups mentioned. The Pb IV compound may be a Pb IV salt, such as PbF₄, PbCl₄, Pb CO₃ ₂ or Pb OAc ₄, or a simple Pb IV oxide, such as PbO₂, or a salt or oxide containing Pb IV compounds, such as Pb₃O₄, or a mixture thereof. The Pb IV compound may conveniently be a lead oxide, carboxylate, carbonate or fluoride. Preferred Pb IV compounds are PbO₂, Pb OAc ₄, PbF₂ OAc ₂, and, especially, PbF₄. As used herein Ac stands for the acetyl group CH₃.CO. If the Pb IV compound is not present, but is replaced by a seemingly similar compound such as MnO₂, Nb OAc ₃ or H₂O₂, no fluorination occurs. Although the precise mechanism of the present reaction is not understood, it is thus clear that the Pb IV compound is not simply functioning as an oxidising agent. Use of at least one mol of Pb IV compound per mol of compound of formula I, and at least two mol per mol when X represents a hydrogen atom, has been found to be very effective. The compound which acts as a base towards HF, i.e. which can accept protons from HF and or donate electrons to HF, may conveniently be a fluoride salt a nitrogen compound of formula NR¹R²R³, wherein R¹, R² and R³ each independently represent hydrogen or alkyl and or R¹ and R² together form an alkylene group, or R¹, R² and R³ together form an alkylylidene group a metal hydroxide or alcoholate or water. The fluoride salt may be for example be an alkaline earth metal fluoride or, preferably, an alkali metal fluoride, especially KF. It is envisageable to use PbF₄ in a double function both as the Pb IV compound and as the compound acting as a base towards HF. The nitrogen compound may be, for example, diethylamine, triethylamine, piperidine, pyridine, or pyrazine. Preferably it is pyridine because the system pyridine HF is convenient to work with in the laboratory or in industry low vapour pressure . The metal hydroxide could be an alkali metal hydroxide, optionally in aqueous solution. Suitably the amount of HF and base should be at least sufficient to provide enough fluorine atoms as needed for the reaction with the phenol compound. Conveniently an excess is used, as this increases the conversion of the more expensive phenol compound. It is not necessary to employ additional solvents or diluents or to work in multiple phase systems. However when the phenol is more than sparingly soluble in the HF base system, the reaction is preferably carried out in the additional presence of a liquid diluent which is substantially inert to and immiscible with hydrogen fluoride, for example a liquid aliphatic, optionally halogenated, hydrocarbon, an ether, or a mixture thereof, advantageously dichloromethane or n pentane. The reaction may conveniently be effected at a temperature in the range 30 to 100 C, preferably 0 to 60 C. The reaction may readily be effected at ambient temperature, e.g. about 20 C. The starting phenols or phenol derivatives are readily available materials. The final products may be used as intermediates in the pharmaceutical or pesticide chemical industry for the synthesis of compounds which in some cases are fluoro analogues of naturally occurring chemicals. As activated double bond containing systems they may undergo various addition reactions, e.g. Michael or Diels Alder reactions. An especially convenient use of the compounds prepared according to the present invention is their conversion into p fluorophenols, as described in UK Patent application No. 8501918 Applicant s ref K 574 . An especially convenient advantage is their ready separability from the starting materials phenols the difference in boiling points between the cyclohexadienones and the corresponding phenols is typically about 100 C, whereas the difference in boiling point between a phenol and a corresponding fluorophenol is typically only about 6 C. The invention will be further understood from the following examples. All yields are calculated on the intake of the phenol and given in molar percentages.
