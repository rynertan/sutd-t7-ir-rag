# Simulation method and apparatus.

## Abstract
Method and apparatus for simulating, within a selected target area, the effectiveness of one of a number of types of ammunition selected, in which a master station transmitter 4, 28 transmits master control signals indicative of the type of ammunition selected and the target area 2 selected. A plurality of remote electromagnetic wave transmitters 30, 32, 34 respond to control signals from said master station transmitter 4, 28 , to make transmissions capable of tra versing the selected target area 2 . Indicators 8 positionable in said target area, respond to said transmissions, to indicate the effect of the selected ammunition at the selected target area 2 .
