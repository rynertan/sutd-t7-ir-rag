# A MULTIPLE DISPLAY CONTROL APPARATUS FOR A TELEVISION RECEIVER

## Abstract
A multiple display control apparatus for a television receiver used for displaying a plurality of signals on a display tube. In a case of switching a first signal output and a second signal output of a signal process circuit are switched by switching circuits, when the two output signals are about equal in the brightness level to each other, the picture is very indistinct. Thus, the first signal level is lowered by means of gain control circuits, the characteristic thereof depending on an output impedance of the signal process circuit and resistances. The control signals for switching and gain control are superposed each other as one signal, so that only one line is used for control signal.
