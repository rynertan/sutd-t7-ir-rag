# Semiconductor device having a protective layer, and method for producing it.

## Abstract
A semiconductor device having a protective polyimide film layer for preventing Î± rays from intruding into the device is provided. The polyimide film layer has incorporated therein a salient amount of finely divided filler particles, and is formed on the surface of at least a region wherein the semiconductor element is formed. The polyimide film layer is formed by coating the semiconductor substrate with a liquid polyimide or polyamic acid composition having incorporated therein the finely divided filler particles, according to a screen printing method.
