# Unsaturated polyester molding compositions containing an epihalohydrin polymer, process for their production and shaped articles therefrom.

## Abstract
Unsaturated molding compositions containing an unsaturated polyester resin, a polymerizable monomer, an epihalohydrin polymer, and optionally, reinforcing fibers, catalyst, thermoplastic polymers, thickening agent and fillers. The epihalohydrin polymer improves the toughness of the molding composition.
