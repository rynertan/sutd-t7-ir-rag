# Azetidinedione compounds as crosslinkers for electrodeposited coatings.

## Abstract
Novel coating compositions are disclosed which com prise aqueous dispersions of polyamine resins in the form of their acid salts along with azetidinedione crossiinking agents and other optional adjuvants The compositions give rise to improved methods for the electrodeposition of heat durable films on substrates. The compositions and methods find particular utility in the cathodic deposition of coatings and films on automotive parts and household appliances.
