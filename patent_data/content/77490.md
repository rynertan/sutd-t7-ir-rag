# Gearing mechanism.

## Abstract
An epicyclic speed reducing mechanism employs, as torque transmitting elements, a series of rolling elements which are constrained to travel along a substantially trochoidal path defined by means of complementary or conjugate surface regions formed on the driving and driven members. The invention is applicable to single or multiple stage speed reducers, and may be of the counterweighted or counterbalanced variety, the latter including a constant velocity coupling operating between an orbiting and rotating element and a further element. In the disclosed embodi ments, the rolling elements may be either balls or rollers, and the surface regions may be conjugate epitrochoidal and hypotrochodial grooves.
