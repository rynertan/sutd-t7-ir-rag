## Abstract
Carrier assembly to be used in combination with one or more transport pallets 1, 2 , comprising at least one carrier unit 6, 7 , each individually fitting round a pallet 1, 2 , and each with a number of interconnected upright parts 6a .. 6d extending above the pallet stack height, which are provided on the top side with a suppor ting surface 6a .. 6d for a load 13 to be stacked thereon.

## Claims
1. Carrier assembly to be used in combination with one or more transport pallets 1, 2 , characterized by a number of carrier units 6, 7 , each individually fitting round a pallet 1, 2 , and each with a number of intercon nected upright parts 6a .. 6d extending above the pallet stack height, which are provided on the top side with a supporting surface 6a .. 6d for a load 11, 12, 13, 14 to be stacked thereon.

## Description
The invention relates to a carrier assembly to be used in combination with one or more transport pallets. During roadtransport of fragile goods on pallets, in particular rolls of asphalt paper which are carried vertically, it often happens that the total weight capaci ty of the transporting lorry or container cannot be used, due to the fact that no other load can be stacked on top of the fragile load taking up the entire floor space. This means that in practice in certain cases up to 25 of the transport weight capacity of the goods vehicle is unused. The object of the invention is to eliminate this disadvan tage. The carrier assembly proposed according to the invention to this end comprises a number of carrier units each individually fitting round a pallet, each with a number of upright interconnected parts and extending above the pallet stack height, and which are provided on the top side with supporting surfaces for a load to be stacked thereon. For use of this carrier assemblY, the goods vehicle is loaded with pallets around each of which a carrier unit reaching above the pallet stack height is fitted the surface formed by the supporting surfaces of the adjacent carrier units can then be used for stacking thereon other loaded pallets or other goods. In a preferred embodiment, the upright parts are formed by the walls of a sheath enclosing the pallet. Here, the supporting surfaces can be formed by flanged edges connec ting with the top side of the walls, but also by a face connecting the upright parts in this way a continuous carrier surface for loading is obtained. Openings corresponding to the space under the pallet are preferably formed in the bottom edges of the upright parts, so that a pallet with a carrier unit fitted on it can always be transported, for example with a forklift truck. Another embodiment comprises two upright parts each at their upper edge connected by means of a hinge to the edge of a third part serving as a supporting surface for the load to be stacked thereon. The invention is explained with reference to the drawing Figure 1 shows two adjacent pallets 1, 2 the latter partially shown , each loaded with a number of vertically standing rolls of asphalt paper 3, on which a number of horizontal rolls 4 are then placed. The nature of this material means that it cannot bear a heavy load when such loaded pallets are transported in the usual manner, the space on top therefore has to remain unused, which means that part of the total loading capacity of the vehicle therefore cannot be used. According to the invention a carrier unit 6, 7 is placed around each of the pallets 1, 2, which in the embodiment shown is constructed as a sheath enclosing the pallet and having upright walls 6a 6d whose top edges merge into flanged edges 6a ... 6d . These flanged edges act as a support for further pallets 11, 12 which are stacked on the pallets 1, 2 and which each bear a load 13, 14. In this way optimum use can be made of the carrying capacity of the transport vehicle. The carrier units are designed with differing dimensions in such a way that they can be transported fitting around one another Figure 3 shows a view of four carrier units 16, 17 18, 19 which fit around one another and can be transported as a unit 15. Figure 4 shows a top view of this combination. Figure 5 shows a unit 20 made up of four carrier units 21 24 which are each closed at the top side by a carrier face 21a 24a the carrier faces 22a, 23a and 24a are shown partially cutaway. The figures also show how the carrier units can be provi ded on the underside with openings 25 which correspond to the spaces 26 under the pallets so that a pallet with a number of carrier units provided around it can always be transported as a unit. The figures 6 and 7 relate to a carrier unit having such shape and dimensions that it can be folded. As a conse quence it takes up less space when not in use. Said embodiment, denoted by reference numeral 30, compri ses the two upright parts 31, 32 and the upper part 33. Each part comprises a large surface 31a, 32a, 33a respec tively, and bent over side edges. Hinges 34 and 35 inter connect the three parts and the dimensions thereof as such that they can be folded one within the other, such as shown in Figure 7. Stays 36, 37 are used to interconnect the edges 31b, 32b, 32c respectively to give the arrange ment rigidity. Of course, these stays can be of any suitable shape and structure. When not in use they can be fitted alongside one of the side edges 31b, 32b, such as indicated by the dotted line 36a.
