# Method of preparing meat for human consumption.

## Abstract
The meat is prepared by deboning and deskinning the meat and then slicing with a multi blade slicer. Congeries of slices are then packaged in the original shape of meat, in sliced form, ready for subsequent cooking. Cooking in sliced form avoids the problem of carving the meat and improves the tenderness of the meat. By packaging a congery of slices a range of sizes of pre sliced prepared joints may be provided.

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. A method of preparing sliced and deboned meat for subsequent cooking and human consumption characterised by the steps of a slicing a deboned and prepared meat muscle across the grain of the muscle whilst retaining the meat muscle in its original shape, so as to produce a congery of slices of a thickness suitable for human consumption without any further reduction in the thickness, and b packaging at least a proportion of the congery of slices, stacked substantially in the original shape of the meat muscle, so as to produce a package or joint of meat of a size suitable for domestic consumption and ready for subsequent cooking in presliced form. 2. A method according to claim 1 characterised by this, that the prepared meat muscle has undesirable skin or fat which is removed before slicing. 3. A method according to claim 1 or claim 2 and characterised by this, that the sliced meat muscle is divided into sections containing a choice of slices, and the sections are packaged separately in metal foil or like containers ready for cooking in a domestic or industrial oven. 4.

## Description
METHOD OF PREPARING MEAT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION This invention relates to a method of preparing meat for human consumption. The term meat includes meat from domestically reared animals such as cattle, pigs, sheep, deer, goat, chicken, turkey and fowl generally. Meat is traditionally butchered by taking the dressed and chilled carcasses of the beef, pork, lamb, etc. which have been broken down into various primal and sub primal joints and then either boned, and defatted or sold in pieces with the bones and fat, for eventual consumption by the purchaser. The techniques used are long standing and traditional and although there are regional variations as to how carcasses are cut up, the techniques that are used have been extant for several hundred years.The tools with which meat is broken down into consumer pieces have changed little in this time. Meat in many parts of the world is usually sold with fat and muscle membranes still adhering and attached to the motor muscles. The name gristle is used to describe connective tissue and muscle membrane which attaches the major muscles to the bones of locomotion. A problem which the meat trade faces and always has faced is the high cost of preparing meat when it involves the removal of fat and muscle membranes, and of course preparing it at a price which the consumer is willing to pay. An object of the present invention is to provide a system which will improve the technique of butchering and also provide and create a very convenient way of preparing a relatively small portion of meat in a much less wasteful and uneconomic way than hitherto. In accordance with the present invention, in its broadest aspect, a method of preparing meat for subsequent cooking and human consumption comprises the steps of a slicing a deboned and prepared meat muscle across the grain of the muscle whilst retaining the meat muscle in its original shape, so as to produce a congery of slices of a thickness suitable for human consumption without any further reduction in the thickness, and b packaging at least a proportion of the congery of slices, stacked substantially in the original shape of the meat muscle, so as to produce a package or joint of meat of a size suitable for domestic consumption and ready for subsequent cooking in pre sliced form. Optionally, before slicing, the prepared meat muscle may have undesirable skin or fat to be removed. The sliced meat muscle may be divided into sections containing a choice of between four and twelve slices, and the sections may be packaged separately in metal foil or like containers ready for cooking in a domestic or industrial oven e.g. by roasting or braising the meat. From another aspect the invention comprises a method of preparing and cooking meat in which a meat muscle is sliced across the grain into a number of slices of a thickness suitable for human consumption without any further reduction in thickness of each slice, the whole meat muscle being so sliced, and cooking the stack of so formed meat slices substantially in the original shape of the meat muscle. In one form of the invention a piece of meat suitable for roasting or braising is deboned, as necessary, and then the membrane that lies underneath the fat or adipose tissue is skinned to expose the muscle fibres themselves. The meat which has been fully de fatted and then skinned is then presented to a multi blade cutting device which will, in one operation, cut the meat into a number of slices at right angles to the grain of the meat. The grain of the meat is formed by the fibres that run from end to end of the muscle. Thus there is formed a cut muscle, divided into a number of slices of a thickness suitable for subsequent human consumption without further reduction in thickness, the slices being retained in their original shape even after being subject to the multiple blade cutting action. The deskinning may be carried out for example by means of a 700 Membrane Skinner of the type manufactured by Townsend Engineering Company of Des Moins, Iowa,United States of America and sold in the United Kingdom by Townsend Engineering UK Limited. The slicing of the whole meat muscle in one operation may be carried out by means of a slicer known as a Height One All made by Height Incorporated, a Japanese Company. This meat slicer has reciprocating blades into which the whole muscle is propelled by means of a pushing mechanism. Typically the slicer will cut 2Xmm slices at a rate of 1200 slices per minute thus making a very fast and efficient operation. This cut muscle can then be apportioned into various weights determined by multiples of slices chosen and placed into a container which can be either oven proof or just as a vehicle for presentation and sale and may be, for example decorated with fat or parsley etc. The containers can then either be sold fresh or frozen, whatever the particular trader wishes and they should have sufficient shelf life to satisfy normal commercial requirements. The invention is particularly beneficial when dealirlg with large cross sectional muscles for example when the butcher is attempting to sell pork legs. This particular cut is difficult to sell in the piece because of its size. Pork legs can range from 8 to 20 pounds in weight and most of them find their way into the bacon and ham industry, although there is a demand for fresh leg meat at retail level. With the present method of preparation the leg can be bored in a piece, cut in the manner previously described and prepared in the manner previously described and presented in a convenient form in unit weights down to 6 ozs or 7 ozs. Another example is leg of lamb. A particular joint weighed 5 lbs 10 ozs in the untrimmed, bone in state and would normally either be sold whole at around 9 or in half to produce a fillet of lamb and a knuckle end of lamb which would put its individual unit cost at around 4.50 to 5 each. This is considered expensive at the moment and the method of this invention achieved the following. When the leg was boned and trimmed, it was 14 ozs of bone, 10 ozs of fat, with leg trim of 1 ozs, leaving boneless leg meat in the piece of approximately 4 lbs. The leg was then sliced as previously described, and broken down into 5 portions. This gave 5 individual joints of 11 ozs, 1 Ib 1 oz, 1 lb 3 ozs, 11 ozs and 10 ozs respectively. This made the leg infinitely more marketable and would give members of the meat buying public greater choice by dint of its lower unit cost, together with the total elimination of waste. Fat may be added back into the packs to provide a medium for roasting which will produce a succulent and moist end product as it is presented on the plate. In the case of pork, the pork skin may be removed by the de skinner and the skin then sliced to produce rind straws which are added to the sliced joint when packaged for sale. When cooked the rind straws brown to form traditional crackling . The technique can also be used for braising meats, such as forequarter, chuck, brisket etc. The braising product can be cooked in a foil container with added vegetables or presented to the oven in the traditional way and served again very conveniently as an economical and delicious meal. When prepared and cooked in this way the meat slices separate very easily and cleanly and can be laid out in various forms to create an appetising and appealing dish. The technique can also be used for the so called gammon joints or fore end joints of bacon where the meat in the cured state is again boned, sliced and then roasted or boiled in its container and or cooking bag to its desired internal finished cooked temperature with subsequent separation of the slices to form individual portions of the desired thickness. This method of pre slicing the meat before cooking has a tenderising effect on the meat when cooked.This is particularly noticeable when the meat muscles are subject to cold shortening. Since the slices result in relatively short meat fibres they do not toughen as readily as they would if cooked whole. Also we have found that the true roast flavour is retained by cooking a congery of slices together whereas if the individual slices are cooked by themselves the flavour is not the same and does not taste like normal roast meat. Further advantages of the process are Cooking time is reduced. There is no need for stringing or netting of the meat and thus labour is reduced. Smaller pieces may be utilized thus increasing the value taken from a given carcass.
