# Sliding gate valves and components thereof.

## Abstract
Valve plates for sliding gate valves have constructions exemplified by Figure 1 in which the refractory components are mounted in metal trays. The valve plate 18 has two refractory plate members 20, 21 bedded on cement 19 in the bottom of the tray 17 plate member 20 is orificed at 14 to convey molten metal to an undermounted nozzle 16 , which is joined to the plate member 2 by a male and female structure 28 such that the male part 29 of the plate member 20 protects the vulnerable inlet end of the nozzle 16 . The plate member 20 but not plate member 21 is designed to be contacted in service by molten metal and is replaceably secured in the tray 17 which has apertures 32 for access of tooling used to displace the plate member 20 out of the tray when replacement of the palte member 20 is necessary.
