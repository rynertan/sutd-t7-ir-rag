# Mechanical conditioning and flocculation of liquids.

## Abstract
This invention relates to flocculation apparatus and a method for the purification of liquids, particularly water, wherein provision is made for initial vigorous mixing of the coagulants in the liquid followed by a gradually diminishing agitation of the liquid and fiocculent to provide proper floc culation the apparatus comprising a circular flat bottomed chamber 1 , a central circular well 7 having vertically extending openings 8 through its wall speced apart cir cumferentially, a plurality of radially extending rotatable arms 13 supported above the chamber, each arm carrying downwardly depending blades 17 spaced apart along the length of the arms and positioned to intersperse with a plurality of series of vertical fixed blades 11 extending radially from the well, and upwardly from the floor 2 of the chamber 1 , the blades 11, 17 extending substantially the full depth of the chamber, at least one feed chamber 4 in communication with the chamber 1 through an opening 3 in the wall thereof, means 18, 19 for rotating the arms 13 and an outlet 9 from the bottom of the well leading to a settling compartment.
