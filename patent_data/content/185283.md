## Claims
Verwendung einer Dihydropyridin Verbindung der Formel worin R¹ Nitrophenyl ist und R², R³ und R⁴ sind jeweils Alkyl mit 1 bis 6 Kohlenstoffatomen, sowie pharmazeutisch annehmbare Salze davon zur Herstellung eines Medikaments zur Behandlung und Verhütung von Arteriosklerose bei Säugern einschließlich des Menschen.

## Description
The present invention relates to a novel use of dihydropyridine compounds. More particularly, it relates to a novel use of the dihydropyridine compounds of the formula in which R¹ is nitrophenyl and R², R³ and R⁴ are each alkyl having 1 6 carbon atoms or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, for the manufacture of medicaments for treating and preventing arteriosclerosis in mammals including human beings. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compound I are conventional non toxic salts and may include an acid addition salt such as an organic acid addition salt e.g. acetate, trifluoroacetate, maleate, tartarate, methanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, formate, and toluenesulfonate , an inorganic acid addition salt e.g. hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, sulfate, nitrate, and phosphate , or a salt with an acidic amino acid e.g. aspartic acid, and glutamic acid . In FR A 2 528 425 dihydropyridine compounds and their use for treatment of arteriosclerosis are described. As a representive example 4 2 nitrophenyl 2,6 dimethyl 3,5 dicarbonethoxy 1,4 dihydropyridine Nifedipine is described which differs from the compounds I only in the nature of the substituent in position 6. The dihydropyridine compound I to be used in the present invention is known and described in some publications, for example, the British Patent 2,036,722. Further, as to the pharmacological property of the dihydropyridine compound I , it is also publicly known that the compound I possesses a vasodilating activity. As a result of an extensive study, the inventors of the present invention have found that the dihydropyridine compound I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof possess an anti arteriosclerotic activity in addition to the known vasodilating activity, and have succeeded in providing the present invention. The anti arteriosclerotic activity of the dihydropyridine compound I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof is a novel pharmacological property, which can be said to be pharmacologically different from the vasodilating activity as described in the prior art mentioned above. Accordingly, the object of the present invention is to provide a novel use of the compound I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, for the manufacture of a medicament for treating and preventing arteriosclerosis. Examples of arteriosclerosis are atherosclerosis, hypertensive arteriosclerosis, Mönckeberg s arteriosclerosis, and hyperplastic arteriosclerosis and the dihydropyridine compounds I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are useful for the treatment and prevention of such diseases. With regard to the dihydropyridine compounds I , suitable examples and illustrations of the definitions for R¹, R², R³ and R⁴ are explained in detail as follows. Suitable example of nitrophenyl for R¹ may include 2 nitrophenyl, 3 nitrophenyl and 4 nitrophenyl, and the preferred one is 3 nitrophenyl. Suitable examples of alkyl having 1 to 6 carbon atoms for R², R³ and R⁴ may include methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, sec butyl, pentyl, isopentyl, neopentyl, 1 or 2 methylbutyl, and hexyl, the preferred one is C₁ C₄alkyl, and the most preferred one for R² is isopropyl and the most preferred examples for R³ and R⁴ are each methyl. The anti arteriosclerotic composition used in the present invention can be administered orally or parenterally to a mammal including a human being in a conventional pharmaceutical form such as capsules, micro capsules, tablets, granules, powders, troches, pills, ointments, suppositories, injection solutions, and syrups. The pharmaceutical composition used in the present invention can be produced by the established procedures using various organic or inorganic carriers, which are conventional for pharmaceutical purpose, such as excipient e.g. sucrose, starch, mannit, sorbit, lactose, glucose, cellulose, talc, calcium phosphate, and calcium carbonate , binding agent e.g. cellulose, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, polypropylpyrrolidone, gelatin, gum arabic, polyethylene glycol, sucrose, and starch , disintegrator e.g. starch, carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl starch, sodium bicarbonate, calcium phosphate, and calcium citrate, , lubricant e.g. magnesium stearate, aerosil, talc, and sodium laurylsulfate , flavouring agent e.g. citric acid, mentol, glycine, and orange powders , preservative e.g. sodium benzoate, sodium bisulfite, methylparaben, and propylparaben , stabilizer e.g. citric acid, sodium citrate, and acetic acid , suspending agent e.g. methyl cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and aluminum stearate , dispersing agent e.g. hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose , diluting agent e.g. water , base wax e.g. cacao butter, white petrolatum, and polyethylene glycol . While the dosage of the active ingredient compound I is varied depending on various factors such as weight and or age of patients and or stages of the diseases, and further the kind of administration routes, it is administered in general by oral route at the daily dose level of 0.5 mg to 1000 mg, preferably 1 mg to 500 mg. An effective single dose can be selected from the range of 0.01 mg kg to 20 mg kg, preferably 0.05 mg kg to 2 mg kg of the patients. For the purpose of showing the utility of the dihydropyridine compound I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof used for the anti arteriosclerotic composition used in the present invention, pharmacological test data of this compound are shown in the following. The arteriosclerosis which is characterized by intimal thickening was made in rabbits about 2 kg weight by the following method. Under pentobarbital anesthesia, the left carotid artery was isolated from the surrounding tissue, put into a cuff 1.5 cm long PE 280 through a longitudinal slit and was returned to the place as it was. Then, the wound was sutured and the rabbits were recovered and fed with normal diet. Three weeks after surgery, the rabbits were anesthetized with pentobarbital. The part of the artery covered by a cuff was examined under microscope for the arteriosclerotic index which was rated at 0, 1, 2 and 3 according to the degree of intimal thickening. For each rabbit, about 30 transverse sections were taken at random, and the mean arteriosclerotic index was used for the determination of the effect. Test Compound was suspended in 0.5 methyl cellulose and injected intramuscularly 5 days a weak beginning from one day after cuff treatment to one day before sacrifice. The injection volume was adjusted to 0.5 ml kg. The present invention is explained according to the following Examples. Dihydropyridine Compound A was dissolved in anhydrous ethanol 5 liters and then hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose was added thereto to prepare a suspension. Then the organic solvent was removed under reduced pressure to give solid dispersion composition. To a suspension of Dihydropyridine Compound A and hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose in anhydrous ethanol 5 liters was added sucrose and the resultant mixture was stirred. Then the organic solvent was removed under reduced pressure to give solid dispersion composition. This composition was converted into fine granules by a conventional method. To a suspension of Dihydropyridine Compound A and hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose in anhydrous ethanol 5 liters were added lactose and low substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose, and the resultant mixture was stirred and then the organic solvent was removed under reduced pressure to give solid dispersion composition. After this composition was converted into granules by a conventional method, the granules were further converted with magnesium stearate into tablets by a conventional method, each of which contains 2 mg of Dihydropyridine Compound A. For each tablet obtained in Example 3, the coating layer consisting of hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose 5.1 mg , titanium dioxide 1.6 mg , polyethylene glycol 6000 0.8 mg , talc 0.4 mg and iron oxide yellow 0.1 mg was film coated by a conventional method to give a film coated tablet containing 2 mg of Dihydropyridine Compound A.
