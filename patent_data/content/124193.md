# Method and device for bacterial testing.

## Abstract
A method of testing for the growth of bacteria in a sam ple comprises introducing the sample into a sterile bacterial growth medium in a closed vessel incubating the vessel, and observing a pressure change within the vessel which indicates the growth of bacteria in the sample. A device for doing this comprises a bottle 10 with a pierceable closure 12 and a syringe comprising a cylinder 16 and a piston 18 connected to a hypodermic needle 20 which passes through the closure 12 and preferably extends below the surface of the growth medium in the bottle.
