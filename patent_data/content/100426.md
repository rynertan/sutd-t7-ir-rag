## Description
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to new organic compounds and, more particularly, is concerned with novel hexahydro or octahydro alkanoisoindoles which may be represented by the following structural formula EMI1.1 wherein n is an integer from 1 to 3 the moiety A B is CH CH or CH2CH2 R1 and R2 are each individually selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, hydroxy, alkyl having up to 3 carbon atoms, alkoxy having up to 3 carbon atoms, nitro, halo, trifluoromethyl, amino and azido R3 is hydrogen or alkyl having up to 3 carbon atoms and R1 and R2 taken together are methylenedioxy or CH2CH2CH2cH2 and the pharmacologically acceptable acid addition and quaternary ammonium salts thereof. A preferred embodiment of the present invention consists of those compounds wherein n is 1 or 2 A B is CH2CH2 R1 and R2 are both chloro and are substituted at the 3 and 4 positions of the phenyl ring and R3 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, methyl and ethyl. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The novel organic free base compounds of the present invention are generally obtainable as viscous liquids, oils or solids ranging in description from colorless to yellow, and red thru brown. They have characteristic absorption spectra and boiling points, and may be purified by selective distillation in vacuo. They are appreciably soluble in many organic solvents such as diethyl ether, ethyl acetate, dichloromethane, toluene and the like but are relatively insoluble in water. The organic free bases of this invention form non toxic acid addition salts with a variety of pharmacologically acceptable organic and inorganic salt forming reagents.Thus, acid addition salts, formed by admixture of the organic free base with one or two equivalents of an acid, suitably in a netural solvent, are formed with such acids as sulfuric, phosphoric, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfamic, citric, lactic, malic, maleic, fumaric, succinic, tartaric, acetic, benzoic, gluconic, ascorbic, and the like. The acid addition salts are generally obtainable as white, gray or yellow crystalline materials having characteristic melting points and absorption spectra and which may be crystallized in a solvent or combination of solvents such as acetone, ethanol, ethyl acetate, diethyl ether acetonitrile, diethyl ether hexane and the like.The acid addition salts are relatively insoluble in non polar organic solvents such as diethyl ether, benzene, toluene and the like but are appreciably soluble in water.For purposes of this invention, the free bases are equivalent to their non toxic acid addition salts. The quaternary salts may be obtained by the combination of the free base with an alkyl halide such as methyl iodide, or a dialkyl sulfate such as dimethyl sulfate to give the quaternary salt compounds as crystalline solids, which are soluble in polar solvents. The novel compounds of the present invention may be readily prepared in accordance with the following reaction scheme EMI3.1 EMI4.1 wherein X is chloro or bromo and n, R1, R2 and R3 are as hereinbefore defined. In accordance with the above reaction scheme, an appropriately substituted benzenediazonium salt 11 is reacted with a maleimide III by the method of P. T. Izzo, J. Org. Chem., 28, 1713 1963 to give the 2 substituted phenyl maleimide IV . This maleimide IV is reacted with cyclopentadiene, cyclohexadiene or cycloheptadiene V in dichloromethane at ambient temperatures 1800C for 10 30 hours to provide the corresponding 2 substitu ted phenyl bicycloalkene dicarboximide VI . The reaction of butadiene with 2 phenylmaleimides is disclosed in U. S.Patent No. 4,042,707 and the reaction of simple maleimides with cyclopentadiene has been described by K. F.Hebenbrock in Liebigs Ann. Chem., 320 1978 . The bicycloalkene dicarboximide VI is then reduced with VITRIDET a 70 solution of sodium dihydrobis 2 methoxy ethoxy aluminate in toluene at room temperature for 2 4 hours followed by heating at reflux for 10 30 hours.Quenching of the reaction mixture by the addition of aqueous base followed by extraction into an organic solvent such as diethyl ether and work up of the extract provides the compounds of the invention I where A B is CH CH . Alternatively, the bicycloalkene dicarboximide VI may be reduced by catalytic hydrogenation to the corresponding 2 substituted phenyl bicycloalkane dicarboximide VII . This reduction may be carried out with noble metal catalysts such as platinum oxide or palladium on carbon in an inert organic solvent such as ethyl acetate at room temperature and a few atmospheres pressure.The bicycloalkane dicarboximide VII is then reduced with borane in tetrahydrofuran at the reflux for 12 24 hours, quenched by the addition of aqueous acid and the compounds of the invention I where A B is CH2 CH2 are isolated by adding base to the aqueous solution and extracting with an organic solvent such as methylene chloride. The compounds of this invention are useful as antidepressant agents in warm blooded animals as verified by the following test. The antidepressant properties of these compounds were tested by measuring their ability to counteract depression induced in animals by the administration of tetrabenazine methanesulfonate. Each test compound was administered orally P.O. or intraperitoneally 1.P. to 10 mice at a dose of 25 mg kg of body weight. Thirty minutes later, tetrabenazine methanesulfonate was administered intraperitoneally to each mouse at a dose of 39 mg kg of body weight, which dose is known to depress markedly the exploratory behaviour of normal mice. Thirty minutes later the mice were tested for their exploratory behaviour as described by E. Greenblatt and A. C. Osterberg, Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology, 7, 566 578 1965 .The results of this test on representative compounds of this invention appear in Table I.

The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 6 hours and then poured into 150 ml of acetonitrile. The resulting solid was collected and washed with water and hexane, giving 3.02 g of 2 E chlorophenyl 5 norbornene 2,3 dicarboxamide. A mixture of 3.66 g of 2 E chlorophenyl 5 nor bornene 2,3 dicarboxamide in 20 ml of Vitride0T sodium dihydrobis 2 methoxyethoxy aluminate 70 solution in toluene was stirred for 3 hours, then heated at reflux for 17 hours and cooled in an ice bath.
