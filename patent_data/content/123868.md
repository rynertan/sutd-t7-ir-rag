# METHOD FOR QUANTITATIVELY DETERMINING THE CONCENTRATION OF HEMOGLOBIN IN A BIOLOGICAL SAMPLE

## Abstract
A method for quantitatively determining the amount of hemoglobin in feces, urine or gastric juice comprising the steps of preparing a test sample of the feces, urine or gastric juice, converting the hemoglobin in the test sample to por phyrin with a converting reagent which is acidic and which has a reducing capacity sufficient to convert substantially all or a reproducible portion of the hemoglobin to porphyrin and determining the level of porphyrin in the test sample.
