# Fluid container with venting means.

## Abstract
A sealable pressure vessel 5 has a closure member 8 held on by means of a bayonet fixing member which is movable between two positions while retaining the mechanical linkage between the vessel 5 and the closure member 8 forming a container 1 . The bayonet fixing comprises a vessel lug 18 which co operates with a stepped slot 17 in a locking ring 9 secured to the closure member 8 . In one position of the lug 18 in the slot 17 the closure member 8 is sealed on the vessel 5 and the container is closed to atmosphere while in another position the seal is broken and the container is open to atmosphere. The closure member 8 incorporates a sliding valve 29 which has a spring urged piston 31 carrying a lock ing pin 32 to lock the lug 18 within the slot 17 when the container is closed to atmosphere. The piston 31 can vent the container to atmosphere when the closure member 8 is sealed to the vessel 5 if the piston 31 is raised since it then connects the interior of the container to atmosphere via a chamber 47 and two ports 48 and 52 . Raising the piston 31 disengages the locking pin 32 from the lug 18 so that the closure member 8 can be removed from the vessel 5 .
