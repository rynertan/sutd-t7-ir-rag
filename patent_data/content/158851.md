# CROSS FLOW DIFFUSION COLUMN

## Abstract
There is provided a cross flow diffusion column posses sing improved properties for maritime use and for use at high gas velocities, this column comprising novel trays of the shelf type. The trays are provided with perforations for a downwardly flowing liquid phase and at least one opening for an upwardly flowing gas phase. Arranged on the upper surfaces of respective trays is a lattice structure comprising vertically mounted sheet like parts, these lattice structures totally eliminating the negative effect which movement of the column might otherwise induce, primarily with respect to the efficiency of the column.
