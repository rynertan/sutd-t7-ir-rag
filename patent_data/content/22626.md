## Description
Novel substituted nitrodiphenyl ethers, herbicide1 compositions containing them and the use thereof for combating weedsThis invention concerns the provision of new nitrodiphenyl ethers, herbicidal compositions containing them, and methods of combating weeds.Diphenyl ethers are known to be effective weed control agents. See for example U.S. Patent Nos. 3,928,416 3,454,392 3,798,276 3,873,303 4,001,005 4,046,798 4,063,929 4,093,446 and 4,029,493 among the many patents issued. However, even now herbicidal effectiveness of a diphenyl ether cannot be predicted from its structure only, and often quite closely related compounds will have quite different weed control abilities. See, Advances in Agronomy, Vol. 24, pages 331, 332, 355, 356, 357 and 358,Herbicides, Chemical Degradation and Mode of Action, Kearney and Kaufman, Vol. 2, Dekker, Inc. pages 552 563 and 728 737 and Mode of Action of Herbicides, Ashton and Crafts and also U.S. Patent Nos. 3,454,392 and 3,776,961.An ideal herbicide should give selective weed control, over the full growing season, with a single administration at low rates of application. It should be able to manage all common weeds by killing or controlling them as the seed, the germinating seed, the seedling, and the growing plant.At the same time, the herbicide should be substantially nonphytotoxic to the crops to which it is applied and should decompose or otherwise be dissipated under field conditions so as not to poison the soil permanently. Finally, they should be essentially nontoxic to animals. Known herbicides often fall short of one or more of these ideals and thus the search continues to discover new herbicides which are more selective or which complement the activities of known diphenyl ethers. Nitrodiphenyl ethers within the scope of the present invention provide a useful choice in comparison with known nitr6diphenyl ei her herbicides particularly as regards one or more of the following, viz good herbicidal activity, selectivity and reduced mammalian toxicity.In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a new class of diphenyl ether herbicides having the following structural formula Formula IEMI2.1 wherein X is hydrogen, halo, trifluoromethyl, Cl C4 alkyl, cyano, or nitro Y is hydrogen, halo, or trifluoromethyl W is O or S O p, wherein p is O to 2 R is Cl C4 alkyl, phenyl, halo substituted phenyl, or trifluoromethyl substituted phenyl, or phenyl C1 C4 alkyl, Q is CH2 n, wherein n is O to 4,or C2 C6 alkeny lene and Z is CO2RÚ, CO2H, CO2, CON R1 2, CN, CH2OH, CH2C1, CORÚ, CH20CH3, CO2 CR2R3 CO R1 or OR1 particularly when n is 1, 2, 3 or 4 and R1 is C1 C4 alkyl , wherein R1 is C1 C4 alkyl, C3 C6 alkenyl, cyano Cl C4 alkyl, C3 C6 alkynyl, C2 C4 haloalkyl, C1 C4 hydroxyalkyl, C1 C4 alkoxy C1 C4 alkyl, C1 C4 alkoxy C1 C4 alkoxy C1 C4 alkyl ie R O R O R where R and R are C1 C4 alkylene and R is C1 C4 alkyl , trifluoroethyl, C2 C4 nitroalkyl, C3 C8 cycloalkyl or phenyl C1 C4 alkyl par ticularly when Z is CO2RÚ Rê and R are the same or different and are selected from hydrogen and methyl, the CR2R3 groups being the same or different when m is 1 and, when Z is C02H, the agronomically acceptable salts of a compound of Formula I.The term halo used throughout this specification means bromo, chloro, fluoro or iodo preferred halo substituents are chloro or fluoro. The terms alkyl , alkoxy , alkenyl and alkynyl refer to all possible straight and branched chain isomeric forms so that, for example, C1 C4 alkyl means each and every one of CH3, C2H5, C3H7, C4H9 and all the isomers of the last two groups.A narrower class of compounds has the formula Formula IIEMI3.1 wherein X is hydrogen, halo for example, bromo, chloro, fluoro, iodo trifluoromethyl alkyl, for ex ample, lower alkyl of from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, preferably methyl or ethyl cyano or nitro more preferably, chloro Y is hydrogen, halo for example, bromo, chloro, fluoro, iodo or trifluoromethyl, preferably hydrogen W is O or S O p, preferably 0, S, or SO, and more preferably 0 R is lower alkyl of from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, phenyl, phenyl Cl C4 alkyl such as benzyl, phen ethyl, R preferably being methyl or ethyl n is from 0 to 4, preferably 0 p is from 0 to 2, preferably 0 or 1 Z is CO2R1, CO2H, CO2, CONH2, CONHR1, COSR1, CON R1 2, CN, CH20H, CH2C1, COR1, or CH20CH3, R being Cl C4 alkyl or C2 C4 alkenyl and, when Z is COOH, the agronomically acceptable salts of Formula II.Examples of salts of compounds of Formulae I and II whenZ is COOH are the ammonia and amine salts, such as of triethylamine, ethanolamine, the alkali metal and alkaline earth metal salts such as those of Li, K, Na, Ca, Ba, Sr and Mg. It is preferred that the salts are storage stable, eg at 18 250C when present in closed containers.A sub class of compounds of Formula II and salts thereof which are the subject of U.S. Patent Application SerialNo. 50284 upon which the present application is partly based are those in which X, Y, W, R, n and p are as defined for Formula II and Z is CO2R1, CO2H, CO2, CONH2,CONHR1, CON R 2 CN, CH20H, CH2C1 or COCH3, RI being Cl C4 alkyl. In this sub class of compounds, it is preferred that X is cyano or chloro, particularly the latter, and Y is hydrogen. A still narrower class of compounds has the formula Formula IIIEMI5.1 in which WR and Z have the meaning given above, and X isCl or CN. Especially preferred compounds of Formula II are those in which X is C1, WR is OCH3 and Z is CO2RÚ in which RI is C1 C4 alkyl or C3 C4 alkenyl.Typical compounds of Formula III have the following values for WR, X and CH2 nZ WR X CH2 nZ WR X CH2 nZ OCH3 Cl CO2CH3, OC6H5 Cl CO2CH3,OCH3 Cl CO2Na, OCH2C6H5 Cl CO2CH3,OC2H5 Cl CO2CH3, OCH3 Cl CO2H,SCH3 Cl CO2C2H5, OCH3 Cl CON CH3 2,SOCH3 Cl CO2C2H5, OCH3 Cl CH2CO2CH3,OCH3 Cl C02C2H5, OCH3 CN CH2C02CH3,OCH3 Cl C2H4OH, OCH3 Cl CO2CH2CO2CH3, CH3 OCH3 Cl CO2CH CH3 2, OCH3 Cl CO2CHCO2CH3, WR X CH2 nZ WR X CH2 nZOCH3 Cl COCH3 OCH3 Cl CO2Ch2CH CH2,SO2CH3 Cl CO2CH3 OCH3 Cl CN, or OCH3 CN C02CH3, and similar radicals for Z in which n is 0.Among these, the following are particularly desirable WR X CH2 nZ WR X CH2 nZOCH3 Cl CO2CH3, OCH3 Cl CO2CH2CO2CH3, CH OC2H5 Cl CO2CH3, OCH3 Cl CO2CHCO2CH3,OCH3 Cl CO2C2H5 OCH3 Cl CO2CH2 CH2,OCH3 Cl CO2CHC CH3 2 OCH3 Cl CH2CO2CH3, orOC6H5 Cl CO2CH3, OCH3 Cl CNA yet narrower class of compounds within the invention has the formula Formula IVEMI6.1 wherein R is Cl C4 alkyl, for example methyl, ethyl, npropyl, iso propyl, n butyl, sec butyl, tert butyl and n and m are 0 or 1. These compounds exhibit particularly good herbicidal activity, and have low toxicity to animals, particularly as to hematological toxicity.The diphenyl ethers of Formula I are useful as preemergence and postemergence herbicides. Preemergence herbicides are ordinarily used to treat the soil by application either before seeding, during seeding, or after seeding and before the crop emerges. Postemergence herbicides are those which are applied after the plants have emerged and during their growth period. The compounds of this invention are especially active as postemergence herbicides.Thus, the invention provides a method of combating weeds, usually in an agronomic crop area, which comprises applying to the growing weeds, eg weed seedlings, or to the growth medium prior to emergence of the weeds, one or more of the diphenyl ethers in an amount sufficient to combat the growth of the weeds.When used in transplanted rice crops, the ethers can be applied either preemergence or postemergence to the weeds that is, they can be applied to the transplanted rice plants and their growth medium eg paddy water either before the weed plants have emerged or while they are in their early stages of growth. The ethers can be applied to the growth medium either before or after the rice has been transplanted to that medium.The diphenyl ethers can be applied in any amount which will give the required control of weeds. A standard rate of application of the diphenyl ethers is from 0.0056 to 5.6Kg ha 0.005 to 5 pounds of diphenyl ether per acre . A preferred range is from 0.01 to 1.12 Kg ha 0.01 to 1 pound per acre . The diphenyl ethers are particularly effective as post emergent herbicides for weeds among the crops soy beans, peanuts, cotton, safflower, rape, sugarbeet and small grain crops such as wheat, barley oats and rice, at extremely low rates of application.Under some conditions, the diphenyl ethers may be advantageously incorporated into the soil or other growth medium prior to planting a crop. This incorporation can be by any convenient means, including simple mixing with the soil, applying the diphenyl ether to the surface of the soil and then discing or dragging into the soil to the desired depth, or by employing a liquid carrier.In their application as herbicides one or more of the compounds of Formula I will usually be used in conjunction with an agronomically acceptable carrier or diluent and optionally a surfactant so as to provide a herbicidal composition which, in general, will contain from 0.1 to 95 more usually 1 to 95 and even more usually 5 to 95 by weight of active herbicidal component comprising or consisting of one or more of the diphenyl ethers of Formula I.These herbicidal compositions may be in the form of readyfor use dusts, solutions, emulsions, suspensions, granules or pellets alternatively they may be in the form of concentrated solutions, wettable powders, water dispersible granules, emulsifiable concentrates, flowable liquid suspensions, flowable emulsion concentrates, pastes or dust concentrates each for dilution with, as the case may be, additional liquid usually water or finely divided solids to give diluted solutions, suspensions, emulsions, or dusts which are then directly usable as herbicidal compositions.By the term agronomically acceptable carrier or diluent as used above is meant a substance which can be utilized to dissolve, disperse, diffuse or otherwise dilute the active ingredient without impairing the effectiveness of the active ingredient and which does no permanent damage to such loci as soil, equipment and agronomic crops.It is usually desirable, particularly in postemergence applications, to include adjuvants, such as wetting agents, spreading agents, dispersing agents, stickers, adhesives, and the like, in accordance with agricultural practices.Examples of adjuvants which are commonly used in the art can be found in the John W. McCutcheon, Inc. publication Detergents and Emulsifiers 1969 Annual .Examples of solvents which are useful in the practice of this invention include alcohols, ketones, aromatic hydrocarbons, dimethylformamide, dioxane and dimethyl sulfoxide.Mixtures of these solvents can also be used. The concentration of the solution can vary from about 28 to about 98 by weight of diphenyl ether s with a preferred range being about 25 to about 75 .For the preparation of emulsifiable concentrates, the diphenyl ether can be dissolved in organic solvents, such as benzene, toluene, xylene, methylated naphthalene, corn oil, pine oil, o dichlorobenzene, isophorone, cyclohexanone, methyl oleate, and the like, or in mixtures of these solvents, together with an emulsifying agent which permits dispersion in water. Suitable emulsifiers include ethylene oxide derivatives of alkylphenols or long chain alcohols, mercaptans, carboxylic acids, and reactive amines and partially esterified polyhydric alcohols.Solventsoluble sulfates or sulfonates, such as the alkaline earth salts or amine salts of alkylbenzenesulfonates and the fatty alcohol sodium sulfates, having surface active properties can be used as emulsifiers either alone or in conjunction with an ethylene oxide reaction productFlowable emulsion concentrates are formulated similarly to the emulsifiable concentrates and include, in addition to the above components, water and a stabilizing agent such as a water soluble cellulose derivative or a water soluble salt of a polyacrylic acid. The concentration of the active ingredient in emulsifiable concentrates is usually about 10 to 60 by weight and in flowable emulsion concentrates, and can be as high as about 75 by weight.Wettable powders suitable for spraying, can be prepared by admixing the compound with a finely divided solid, such as clays, inorganic silicates and carbonates, and silicas and then incorporating wetting agents, sticking agents, and or dispersing agents. The concentration of active ingredients in such formulations is usually in the range of about 20 to about 98 , preferably about 40 to about 75 by weight.A dispersing agent can constitute about 0.5 to about 3 by weight of the composition, and a wetting agent can constitute from about 0.1 to about 5 by weight of the composition. Dusts can be prepared by mixing the compounds of the invention with finely divided inert solids which may be organic or inorganic in nature. Materials useful for this purpose include, for example, botanical flours, silicas, silicates, carbonates and clays. One convenient method of preparing a dust is to dilute a wettable powder with a finely divided carrier. Dust concentrates containing about 20 to about 80 by weight of the active ingredient are commonly made and are subsequently diluted to about 1 to about 10 by weight use concentration.Granular formulations can be prepared by impregnating a solid such as granular. fuller s earth, vermiculite, ground corn cobs, seed hulls, including bran or other grain hulls, or similar material. A solution of one or more of the diphenyl ethers in a volatile organic solvent can be sprayed or mixed with the granular solid and the solvent then re moved by evaporation. The granular material can have any suitable size, with a preferable size range of 16 to 60 mesh. The diphenyl ether will usually comprise from about 2 to about 15 by weight of the granular formulation.The diphenyl ethers of the invention can also be mixed with fertilizers of fertilizing materials before their application. In one type of solid fertilizing composition in which the diphenyl ethers can be used, particles of a fertilizer or fertilizing ingredients, such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, or ammonium phosphate, can be coated with one or more of the ethers. The solid diphenyl ethers and solid fertilizing material can also be admixed in mixing or blending equipment, or they can be incorporated with fertilizing in granular formulations. Any relative proportion of diphenyl ether and fertilizer can be used which is suitable for the crops and weeds to be treated.The diphenyl ether will commonly be used from about 5 to about 25 by weight of the fertilizing composition. These compositions provide fertilizing materials which promote the rapid growth of desired plants, and at the same time control the growth of undesired plants.The diphenyl ethers of the invention can be applied as herbicidal sprays by methods commonly employed such as conventional high gallonage hydraulic sprays, low gallonage sprays, airblast spray, aerial sprays and dusts. For low volume applications a solution of the compound is usually used. The dilution and rate of application will usually depend upon such factors as the type of equipment employed, the method of application, the area to be treated and the type and stage of development of the weeds.For some applications, it may be desirable to use the diphenyl ethers of Formula I in conjunction usually in admixture with other herbicides such as those listed in The Pesticide Manual, the British Crop Protection Council Sixth Edition, 1979 and those listed in Applicant sAustralian Published Patent Specification No. 506,509 Application No. 28372 77 .The following examples are given by way of illustration.Percentages are on a weight basis unless otherwise indicated.Example 1Preparation of Methyl 2 methoxy 2 2 nitro 5 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethylphenoxy phenoxy acetateThe potassium salt of 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 hydroxy4 nitrodiphenylether 9 g, Vide U.S. Patent No. 4,093,446 for preparation in dimethyl sulfoxide was reacted with methylo chloro methoxyacetate 4.3 g, vide Gross andFreiberg, Chem.

Except where noted by an asterisk, the results in Table VII were obtained at an application rate of 0.56 Kg ha 0.5 lb acre of the diphenyl ether. As may be noted, the compounds are quite active, and in some cases selective herbicidecrop activity does not appear until quite low levels of herbicide are reached. In some cases, e.g. soybeans, the injury is only temporary.WEEDS MONOCOTSALG ALEXANDER GRASS Brachiaria plantagineaBYG BARNYARDGRASS Echinochloa crus galliCAN CANARY GRASS Phalaris minorDB DOWNYBROME Bromus techorumFOX FOXTAIL, GREEN Setaria viridisJON JOHNSONGRASS Sorghum halepenseNUT NUTSEDGE, YELLOW Cyperus esculentusWO WILD OAT Avena fatua DICOTSANO ANODA Anoda cristataBID BIDENS Bidens pilosaBND BINDWEED Convolvulus arvensisCD CURLY DOCK Rumex crispusCKL COCKLEBUR Xanthium pensylvanicumEUP EUPHORBIA Euphorbia heterophyllaMA MARIGOLD Tagetes spp. MG MORNINGGLORY X Ipomoea spp.MT MATRICARIA Matricaria spp.SIC SICKLEPOD Cassia obtusifoliaTBW TARTARY BUCKWHEAT Fagopyrum tataricumTEA TEAWEED Sida spinosaTOM TOMATO Lycopersicon esculentumVEL VELVETLEAF Abutilon theophrastiWC WILD CARROT Daucus carotaWKL WHITE COCKLE Lychnis albaWM WILD MUSTARD Brassica kaberWR WILD RADISH Raphanus raphanistrum CROPSCN CORN Zea maysCOT COTTON Gossypium hirsutumPNT PEANUTS Arachis hypogaeaRA RAPE Brassica napusRI RICE Oryza sativaSB SUGARBEET Beta vulgarisSF SUNFLOWER Helianthus annuusSOY SOYBEAN Glycine maxWHT WHEAT Triticum spp. TABLE VIIEx.ALG BYG CAN DB FOX JON NUT WO ANO BID BND CD CKL 1. 10 100 35 99 100 80 40 99 90 100 90 100 100 2. 100 95 100 50 40 80 100 100 100 3. 99 99 100 40 10 90 100 100 100 100 100 4. 100 99 100 50 30 100 100 5. 100 40 100 40 20 80 100 100 100 6. 97 40 40 15 10 25 99 100 100 7. 0 10 20 0 25 10 0 10 15 85 80 8. 0 10 0 0 10 10 0 5 10 30 95 10 9. 40 10 30 15 10 10 100 10.11.12. 70 30 75 40 90 20 15 25 60 100 100 75 13. 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 20 95 10 14. 0 0 0 0 25 0 10 5 50 85 100 15 15. 0 15 30 0 70 40 10 20 15 95 50 16. 10 10 35 0 40 20 0 25 40 80 100 15 17. 0 0 10 0 50 20 0 5 40 50 100 10 18. 20 0 40 30 25 0 10 10 100 100 20 100 100 19. 25 20 15 10 25 10 0 15 99 100 75 99 80 TABLE VII CONT D TABLE VIIEx.
