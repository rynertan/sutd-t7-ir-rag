# Purge and prime fuel delivery system and method.

## Abstract
A fuel delivery system particularly useful for supplying petroleum distillate fuels to a fuel combustion device is described. When such device is operated in cold ambient conditions, fuel clogging can occur in the fuel supply lines. In the past, attempts to overcome such problems have been directed toward applying heat to the portions of the conduits subject to restrictions or by introducing solvents into the fuel. These steps are, however, unsatisfactory. In accordance with this invention, the fuel supply conduits are drained of fuel upon shut down of the associated engine or other fuel fired device. Upon an engine start up command, a small quantity of fuel is warmed, preferably using an electric immersion type heater. Once a sufficient fuel temperature is reached, the fuel conduits are reprimed with fuel. Since the fuel does not cold soak in these conduits, fuel clogging problems are eliminated. Various methods for venting the fuel supply conduit enabling such purging and priming is described.
