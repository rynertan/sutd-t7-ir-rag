# Automatic direct soft cookie loading apparatus.

## Abstract
Relatively flexible cookie trays 10 are supported on a rotatable mount. The cookie trays are not solidly supported, but rather are supported along portions beneath, and in between, regions where cookies C are to be received. As the trays are relatively flexible, it is important that, for soft cookies, no rigid or hard surface be encountered during the relatively high speed loading operation. In connection with this invention, a cookie separating device is used which includes a pair of fingers holding cookies back and releasing them individually at time intervals. Also included is a conveyor belt feeding directly and selectively to one of two conveyor belts 6, 7 , each conveyor belt being fed having a far end which directly loads empty cookie trays by moving upward or downward relative to the cookie tray as well as extending toward and away from the tray. The cookie trays which are rotatably mounted may be mounted on a carousel type of support 20 , which automatically rotates and which can be automatically loaded and unloaded.
