# AUTOMATIC VALVE BAG PLACER

## Abstract
An automatic valve bag placer 21 is disclosed which is constructed to sequentially remove valve bags 23 from a bag magazine 24 , manipulate the end flap 58 of the bag 23 for opening, open the valve and place the same on a fill spigot 106 . An improved bag magazine 24 and feeding assembly 22 in which a plurality of trays 43, 44 are mounted on an elevator 46, 47 and feed stacks of limited number of bags 23 onto a pick off support structure 34, 36 ensures that bags 23 are picked off one by one. The bag 23 is oriented by a horizontal 26 and then a vertical conveyor 27 to a near vertical orientation, which orientation is retained thereafter until the bag 23 is placed on the fill spigot 106 . A pair of carriages 77, 101 and associated clamping means 73, 97 first pass the bag 23 through a deflector assembly 28 to orient the valve for opening, and then, after opening, the second carriage 101 carries the bag 23 to and inserts the same over the fill spigot 106 .
