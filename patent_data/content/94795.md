# Low severity fluidized hydrocarbonaceous coking process.

## Abstract
A fluid coking process is provided in which a carbo naceous feed 10 is first coked in a dense fiuidized bed first coking zone 12 and the effluent of the dense bed is passed as a suspension through a transferline second coking zone 18 . A major portion of the solids is separated from the effluent of the upper end of the transferline and passed to a third coking zone 34 which is operated at a higher temperature than the other coking zones and in which the first 12 and second coking zones 18 are positioned.
