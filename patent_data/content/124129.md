# Method and apparatus for manufacturing a woven slide fastener stringer.

## Abstract
A method and an apparatus for manufacturing a woven slide fastener stringer wherein synthetic resin fastener ele ments in the form of a continuous spiral are formed at the same time that the fastener tape is woven. In the method, the monofilament for forming the fastener elements is ad vanced toward a hook on one side of warp bunches from the other side thereof, engaged on the hook at the advanced po sition and guided into a fell via the one side of the warp and is thereafter deformed into a loop shaped fastener element. The apparatus includes a carrier for advancing the monofil ament across the warp bunches and a swinging arm swing ably positioned at one side of the warp bunches. The swing ing arm includes the hook for engaging the monofilament for forming fastener elements and is swingable between a first position wherein the hook ist situated at one side of a fell and a second position wherein the hook is remote from the fell. The monofilament is passed through the carrier and is advanced to the position where it engages the hook when the swinging arm is in the second position.
