# Scan conversion circuit.

## Abstract
A scan conversion circuit for a thermal imager device in which a field is scanned by a parallel series array of infra red detectors swept broadside over the field to produce a band of parallel I.R. signals. The signals from the array of detectors are sampled at high speed in a pattern which traces each parallel line of detectors in turn. A C.R.T. is scanned in a similar pattern, the pattern being repeated at high speed with successive lateral displacements corresponding to the rate at which the I.R. array sweeps the field.
