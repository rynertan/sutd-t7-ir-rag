# PREPARATION OF CYANO OR AMINOALKYL SUBSTITUTED AROMATIC AMINES

## Abstract
The present invention provides a process for preparing compounds of formula 5 NH₂ AX CH₂NH₂ 5 which are useful as intermediates in the preparation of com pounds which are histamine H₁ antagonists. In formula 5 A is a 5 membered heterocyclic aromatic group containing up to three hetero atoms of which no more than one can be oxygen or sulphur and from one to three can be nitrogen a 6 membered monocyclic aromatic group optionally containing up to three nitrogen hetero atoms or a 9 or 10 membered bicyclic aromatic group optionally containing up to four hetero atoms, of which no more than one can be oxygen or sulphur and from one to four can be nitrogen, the group A being option ally substituted with one or more groups which are inert under the reaction conditions X is a C₁ ₅ alkylene group or a C₂ ₅ alkenyle group which comprises a reacting a compound of formula 6 NO₂ AX CN 6 where A and X are as defined with reference to formula 5 with hydrazine in the presence of a transition metal catalyst to form a compound of formula 7 NH₂ AX CN 7 where A and X are as defined with reference to formula 5 and thereafter b reacting the compound of formula 7 so obtained with more hydrazine and Raney nickel.
