# PORTABLE HEAT FLUXMETER FIXTURE

## Abstract
A thermal fluxmeter having opposed surfaces having and forming an output signal by means of a plurality of ther mocouples connected to each other and positioned adjacent the opposed surfaces is used. The thermal fluxmeter is sup ported in a fixture. A force applied to the fixture and fluxmeter establishes a stabilized contact force against a surface to measure heat loss through the surface. This avoids variations in surface contact.
