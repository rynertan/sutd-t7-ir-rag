# Method for drying oxide glasses.

## Abstract
An oxide glass is dried by passing through a melt of the glass fluorine or another perhalogenated compound including fluorine atoms. For example, C₃F₈ e.g. after pre cracking can be used to reduce the OH content of a borosilicate glass, and the loss of an optical fibre drawn from such a glass, to low levels.
