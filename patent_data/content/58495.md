# Steering column assembly.

## Abstract
A steering column assembly comprises a column part 1 rotatable in a support 7 attached to a bracket 8 which can be secured to a fixed member, a sliding connection e.g. formed by a slot 16 and pin 20 permitting movement along an axis A and about a pivot axis B perpendicular thereto to permit height and rake adjustment, and a guide e.g. formed by the peripheral edge of an aperture 17 in the slot which is engaged by a follower 31 fixed to the support 7 which defines the limits of the range of relative move ment of the column part 1 thereby reducing the risk of interference with adjacent components. The follower 31 forms part of a locking mechanism 21, 22, 38, 43 for fixing the bracket and the support in a desired relative configura tion.
