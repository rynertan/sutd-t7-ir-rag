# Apparatus with plural sensors for positioning a fluid lance nozzle.

## Abstract
A sludge lance nozzle 35 for removing sludge from a tube sheet in regions between the tubes of a nuclear steam generator includes positioning apparatus mounted on top of the nozzle. The tubes are arranged in rows 21 and columns 23 with the axes of the tubes in each column lying in a com mon column plane. The nozzle is moved perpendicular to the column planes close to one of the rows of tubes. In one em bodiment, the positioning apparatus comprises two transmit ter receivers 41, 42 for transmitting signals and receiving re flected signals along axes parallel to the column planes, the axes being spaced apart by odd multiples of one half tube pitch. The received signals are subtracted to produce a posi ton indicating signal. In another embodiment the positioning apparatus includes a transmitter 51 and a receiver 52 spaced apart in the direction of movement of the nozzle, the transmitter transmitting a signal in a first predetermined direc tion, and the receiver being responsive only to reflected sig nals received from a second predetermined direction.
