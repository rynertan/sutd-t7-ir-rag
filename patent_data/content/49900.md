# Ink jet printing apparatus.

## Abstract
An ink jet printing apparatus comprises a nozzle head 1 including, orifices 4a 4e for injecting ink particles 15 , pressure chambers 3a 3e each having a piezoelectric element 12a 12e for applying a pressure wave to ink in the chamber and each communicating with corresponding one of the orifices and an ink chamber 5 communicating with the pressure chambers, and electrical signal applying device 14 for applying an electrical signal to selected one or ones of the piezoelectric elements to produce the pressure waves. The electrical signal applying device applies a main electrical signal pulse P₁ to the selectecd one or ones of the piezoelectric elements for inducing rises of the pressure waves and applies a sub electrical signal pulse P₂ for suppressing the pulsations of the pressure waves a predeter mined time interval ΔT after the main electrical signal.
