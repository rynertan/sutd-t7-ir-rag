## Description
ELASTOMER, POLYPROPYLENE BLENDS FOR OPTICALLY CLEAR PRODUCTS FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to blend compositions for optically clear products consisting essentially of an ethylene propylene elastomer and polypropylene, preferably a random reactor copolymer. PRIOR ART Optically clear film products find particular utility in medical facilities, particularly where the clarity is important for monitoring fluid intake and detecting fluid contamination. Plastic vinyl materials have traditionally been utilized, but problems have been encount ered because of serious adverse reactions from the plastics cizers recurred because of their extractibility and suspected carcinogenicity. The prior art has suggested numerous polyolefin blends, e.g., U.S. Patent 3,515,775 and 4,087,485 to give the desired film products. In general, these blends have been unable to replace the vinyl plastics because of dif ficult reproducibility, poor optical quality, or the need for calendering to provide clarity. A significant aspect of the cl2rity requirement is that that property survive autoclave sterilization.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It has now been found that blends consisting es sentially of an ethylene propylene elastomer, and polypropylene, preferably a random polypropylene reactor copolymer, provide films anc other products which are both optically clear and flexible when rapidly quenched, thus overcoming the difficulties o the prior art in replacing the vinyl materials. It is surprising that these properties are obtained, since plastic blends without plasticizers re aul re high elastomer content to achieve desired flexibility anc introduction of an elastomer into a plastic blend produces poorer optical properties. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The elastomer is a non crosslinked ethylene propylene elastomer having a Mooney viscosity, ML 1 t 8 commat 127 C in the range of about 10 to 40, preferably 15 to 25, and at least 50 weight percent ethylene, up to 85 percent, preferably about 60 to 80 percent, with the balance predominantly propylene. The term ethylene propylene elasto mer is intended to generically connote ethylene proplyene copolymers EPM and ethylene propylene terpolymers EPDM .Typical of the third monomers is a C5 C14 nonconjugated diolefin. Non limited examples of such nonconjugated di olefins include the following A. Straight chain acyclic dienes such as 1,4hexadiene and 1,6 octadiene B. Branched acyclic dienes such as 5 methyl 1,4hexadienes, 3,7 dimethyl 1,6 octadiee, 3,7 dimethyl 1,7octadiene and mixed isomers of dihydromyrcene, and di hydroocimene. C. Single ring alicyclic dienes such as 1,4 cyclo hexadiene, 1,5 cyclooctadiene and 1,5 cyclododecadiene. D. Multi ring alicyclic fused and bridged ring diene such as tetrahydroindene, methyl tetrahydroindene, alkenyl, alkylidene, cycloalkenyl and cycloalkylidene norbornenes such as 5 methylene 2 norbornene MNB , 5 ethylidene 2 norbornene ENB , 5 propenyl 2 norbornene, 5 isopropylidene 2 norbornene, 5 4 cyclopentenyl 2norbornene, and 5 cyclohexylidene 2 norbornene. Preferred is 5 ethylidene 2 norbornene ENB . These ethylene higher alpha olefin copolymers and terpolymers may be prepared by any conventional manner and te preparation cf same does not constitute part o the instant invention. Blends useful in this invention employ polypropylene which can be a highly crystalline isotactic or syndiotactic polypropylene. Also, the polypropylene can re a copolymer, referred to as a random polypropylene reactor copolymer, containing minor amounts of an alphaolefin comonomer of 2 to 16 carbon atoms. The level of comonomer which can be utilized is about 1 to about 20 weight percent, preferably about 2 to about 18, most preferably about 2 to about 15 a preferred comonomer is ethylene. These are art recognized materials, see, e.g., Mbdern Plastics Encyclopedia 1981 1982, pages 532, 533. The random reactor copolymer is particularly preferred because it gives lower stiffness and better optical properties.Espe cm ally useful is the random copolymer containing about 3 percent ethylene and having a melt flow rate of 4.0 at 2300C ASTM D1238 condition L . The elastomer is employed in the blend in an amount of about 1 to 80 weight percent, and the polypropylene in an amount of about 20 to 99 weight percent. In audition to the active components, various in gredients can be incorporated into the composition in order to achieve various cost and or performance objectives in specific enc use applications. For example, one can use such materials as process aids e.g., stearic acid , lubricants e.g., oleamide, oil , antiblocking aids, antioxidants, foaming agents and non extractible low MW polyethylene or oxidized polyethylene waxes as slip agents. Polypropylene and reactor copolymer can be blended as one phase to optimize cost or performance properties e.g., flexibility, softening temperature, etc. . Preparation of compositions of this invention, i.e., the blend of polyolefin plastics and elastomer as described above, can be achieved in several different ways.The polyolefin plastics and elastomer are brought into in timate contact by, for example, dry blending these materials and then passing the overall composition through a com pounding extruder. Alternatively, the polyolefin plastics and elastomer can be fed directly to a mixing device such as a compounding extruder, shiah shear continuous mixer, two roll mill, an internal mixer such as a Danbury, etc.he optonal ingredients previously described can be added to the composition during this mixing operation. It is also possible to achieve melt mixing in an extruder section of a film line or in an injection or extrusion blow molding machine. Overall, the objective is to obtain a uniform dispersion of all ingredients and this is readily achieved by inducing sufficient shear and heat to cause the plastics component s to melt. however, time and tem perature of mixing should be controlled as is normally done by one skilled in the art so as to avoid molecular weight degradation or volatilization of any of the ingredients. The blends of the invention can be used to pro duce films, filaments, rods, protective coatings, molded and extrude shaped articles, and the like, by procedures known in the art. These compositions are particularly useful for producing materials requiring clarity, such as blow molded containers and the like, provided the melt is quenched quickly. This invention and its advantages will be better understood from the following examples.Example 1 Blends of various grades of EP elastomers and homo polypropylene were Banbury mixed and underwater pel letized as shown in Table 1. The pellets were then fed into a 1 24 l D 3 HP extruder ano cast into film form on a chilled roll. Optical properties of each film were measured on a Garnder XI 211 Hazemeter. The characteris tics of each grade of EP elastomer are described in the Table. The unmodified homo polypropylene was cast as z control film.As shown by the data, optical properties haze and gloss vary, depending cn the particular grade of elastomer used. lowest haze and highest film closs were achieved which z 15 ML, 78 C2 EPDM. High haze was generally observed with high Mooney elastomer. An ethyl ene content of 3 percent resulted in a tacky film sur face.Although the blends contain 60 percent elastomer, neir optics surprisingly rival the performance of unmodi ed homo polypropylene and the resulting films are very flexible due to the high elastomer content.Example 2 Blends of some of the same elastomers from Example 1 were mixed with a random reactor copolymer polypropylene as shown in Table 2 and processed into film in the same manner. Comparing the data between Tables 1 and 2 indicates slightly better optics for the reactor copolymer vs. the homo polymer. Again, very good optics forEP 4 grade of EPDM are noted relative to the other grades tested, once again comparing favorably to the polyolefin itself, but at significantly reduced stiffness.Example 3 Pellets of EP 4 elastomer and a ransom reactor copolymer same as Example 2 were dry blended and fed to an extruder and cast into film. Compositions evaluated as shown in Table 3 demonstrate that good optical properties were achievable with this grade of EPDM over a wide range of blend compositions without the benefit of high shear intensive mixing. The extruder used was a lt Killion ModelKL 100 24 1 L D.Example 4 The blends shown in Table 4 were Banbury mixed and underwater pelletized into approximately 1 8 inch pellets. They were cast into film on a small laboratory ex truce, producing the excellent optical properties shout. Bags were fabricated from the films using an impulse heat sealer and filled with approximately 800 9. water. The filled bags exhibited a soft feel and outstanding seethrough clarity. The bags were successfully autoclaved without dimensional change at 250 F and retainer a very high level of see through clarity after sterilization. Example 5 The compositions o Exartle L were also successSully blow molded into a flexible container, filled with water, and steam sterilize. The containers exhibited good see through clarity before and after autoclaving.
