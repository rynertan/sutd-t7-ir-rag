# A method for continuously producing a powder filled tubular welding electrode.

## Abstract
A method for continuously producing a powder filled tubular welding electrode, whereby a metallic band while being fed is formed to a gutter 16 and thereupon to a tube 21 , whereby the edges of the gutter are welded together and welding powder is supplied via a conduit 18, 19 to the welded tube, and the welding powder free space of the tube being filled with a protective gas. The object of the invention is to provide a method for continuous production of a tubular welding electrode, especially a tubular welding electrode for welding without external supply of protective gas. The invention is characterized by the fact that the welding powder is introduced in a container 11 , which is evacuated of an essential portion of its air content, whereupon the protective gas is introduced into the container until a positive pressure has been reached therein, and the powder protective gas mixture thereupon being supplied to the tube 21 , whereby in the conduit 18, 19 is maintained a gas pressure, which is somewhat higher than the atmospheric pressure.
