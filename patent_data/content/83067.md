# Digital pressure transducer.

## Abstract
A digital pressure transducer is formed by mounting a force sensitive resonator to a structure of nonsymmetrical configuration which produces loads under applied pressure. The frequency of the resonator is measured to provide a digital indication of the applied pressure.
