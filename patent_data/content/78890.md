# METHOD OF FABRICATION OF DIELECTRICALLY ISOLATED CMOS DEVICE WITH AN ISOLATED SLOT

## Abstract
A method of fabricating an integrated circuit on a body of semiconductor material having a major surface layer of 110 crystallographic orientation by etching vertical slots into the layer to form distinct islands depositing dopant species in predetermined ones of the silicon islands so that the major surface and exposed edges of ones of the islands become second conductivity type and thermally oxidizing the exposed surface portions of the body so that oxide fills the vertical slots between the islands.
