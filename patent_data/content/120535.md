# Beam exposure apparatus comprising a diaphragm drive for an object carrier.

## Abstract
A beam exposure apparatus comprises a displacement mechanism which serves for the displacement of an object to be irradiated and which comprises a diaphragm drive. The diaphragm drive may be rigidly connected to a wall of the apparatus, a secondary shaft of the diaphragm drive being connected, by way of a friction coupling, to a part of the object carrier to be positioned. The diaphragm drive is driven by a direct current drive motor which is powered by a pulsed direct current. The object can thus be positioned with a step accu racy of approximately 0.2 Âµm this positioning can also be measured with this accuracy, for example, by means of an inductive position detector.
