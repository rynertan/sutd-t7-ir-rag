# Snap disc condition sensor and method for producing the same.

## Abstract
A bimetal snap disc thermostat is disclosed which is structured for automated assembly. Such thermostat in cludes a body 10 with contact supports 13, 14 molded therein in a manner providing sufficient strength so that terminals can be riveted onto the contact supports 13, 14 after assembly. The body and contact support subassembly is structured so that it is symmetrical on opposite sides of a central axis. A disc cup 36 is provided with axial and radial surfaces which accurately locate the disc 37 during and after assembly. Also disclosed is a method of gaging and calibrating the thermostat automatically. Calibration of the spring force of the movable contact 27 is accomplished by sensing the force in a given position and subsequently deforming the spring until a predetermined force exists in such predetermined position. Gaging is accomplished by deforming a projection 43 from the movable contact arm 22 until a predetermined uniform spacing is established between such projection 43 and a gaging surface.
