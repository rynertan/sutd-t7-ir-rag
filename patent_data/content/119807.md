# HEATING OF LIQUIDS

## Abstract
Apparatus and method for heating electrically insulating liquids, e.g. diesel fuel, by means of a conductive polymer heater which does not have an insulating jacket, so that there is direct physical contact between the liquid and electrically conductive parts of the heater. This results in improved heat transfer to the liquid.
