# Pump.

## Abstract
A pump for pumping liquids includes a casing formed by upper and lower casing parts 10, 11 secured together. The upper casing part houses a centrifugal rotor having blades 52 which direct liquid to a volute 30 and the lower casing part houses an axial lift impellor which supplies liquid to the centri fugal rotor by way of blades 55. The lower casing part also houses a further rotor 72 which induces flow of liquid through the pump inlet 9. The rotor 72 is directly connected to a drive shaft 34 and the centrifugal rotor and impellor are coupled to the shaft preferably through step up gearing.
