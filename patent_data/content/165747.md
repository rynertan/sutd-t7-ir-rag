# Machine for making paper booklets.

## Abstract
Apparatus is provided in which booklets of interleaved cigarette papers can be made from continuously moving strands of strip paper in which a cutting knife used to sever the paper strips precisely follows movement of the strip. Movement of a driven input shaft 51 is brought onto the moving platform 25 and used to operate the cutting knife 29 . Paper from bobbins 10, 11 is converged by formers 15, 17, 18 and a spreader 16 into a strand advanced by nip rolls 21,22 through cutting station 25 . The knife 29 in the station cuts a booklet from the strand while the station 25 moves with the strand. A driven rotatory shaft 76 of non circular section transmits its rotation to sleeve 81 that slides therealong so the station 25 reciprocates relative to shaft 76 . The sleeve 81 is operably connected e.g. by gearing or by a cam and follower to the knife 29 so that rotation thereof brings about the cutting movement.
