# Execution unit for data processor using segmented bus structure.

## Abstract
A data processor having a novel execution unit 16 is disclosed which employs a segmented bus structure 10, 20, 32 12, 22, 34 and a dual port register cell 138 in order to increase circuit density and in order to allow address and data computations to occur simultaneously. The disclosed circuit is designed to interface with an external 16 bit bidirectional data bus and an external address bus having as many as 32 address bits.
