# Helical scan type magnetic recording and reproducing apparatus.

## Abstract
A helical scan type magnetic recording and reproducing apparatus comprises a rotary body 52, 53, 89, 90 which is wrapped with a magnetic tape 55, 92, 113 on an outer peripheral surface thereof over a predetermined angular range and has a tape guide 54, 91 for guiding a part of the magnetic tape, and n pairs of rotary heads Y1, Y2, C1, C2, H1 H6 mounted on the rotary body. Each pair out of the n pairs of rotary heads is constituted by two rotary heads which are mounted at mutually opposite positions on a rotational plane of the rotary body at the same height position, and each pair out of the n pairs of rotary heads is mounted at different positions in an axial direction of the rotary body. The n pairs of rotary heads simultaneously a record a luminance signal and two kinds of signals constitut ing a color video signal on n groups of tracks T
