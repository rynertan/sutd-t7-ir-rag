# Bulky non woven fabric of polybutylene terephthalate continuous filaments.

## Abstract
Non woven fabric comprising polybutylene tere phthalate continuous filaments having a three dimensional crimp of unfixed shape provides remarkable resiliency. flexibility, and strength. A method of manufacturing such non woven fabric forms a blended yarn of polybutylene terephthalate continuous filaments and highly shrinkable continuous filaments having a low melting point through direct coupling with high speed take off means, and sub jecting the resultant web to a relax heat set.
