# Method for producing mesophase pitch and binder pitch.

## Abstract
A method of producing a pitch or a coke, comprising reacting an aromatic hydrocarbon with anhydrous AlCl₃ and an acid salt fo an organic amine which acid salt reduces the activity of the AlCl₃ and is miscible with the AlCl₃ to form a molten eutectic salt mixture reactive with the aromatic hy drocarbon.
