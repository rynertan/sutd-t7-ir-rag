# Therapeutically active compound and pharmaceutical composition containing the same.

## Abstract
Therapeutically active organic compound exhibiting at least one radical comprising a structure S S R, where S R is defined by R being an organic group comprised in a physiologically acceptable compound H S R obtainable by the splitting of the disulfide bridge S S in said structure, in which compound H S R the sulfur atom S is bound to a carbon atom in a heterocyclic aromatic ring in R having a configuration being such that the compound H S R, while maintaining physiological acceptability, is stabilized, by tautomerism or resonance involving the sulfur atom S bound to R, so as to be mainly excluded from further reaction involving thiol disulfide exchange S being bound to an aliphatic carbon atom and said compound, in addition to the group or groups comprising the structure S S R, also consisting of a residue of a therapeutically active organic base compound of polypeptide structure bound to S , for therapeutical use in mammals, including humans. The invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composi tion containing as an active substance the compound mentioned above.
