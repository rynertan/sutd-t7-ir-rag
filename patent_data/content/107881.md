# Device for moving an element between two end positions by means of an energy buffer.

## Abstract
Device for moving an element between two end posi tions and for selectively holding this element alternately in one of these positions, comprising an energy buffer 1 mechanically coupled with this element, which buffer may be in one of two corresponding stationary end states, in which the energy is present in the form of potential energy, and in intermediate translation states, in which potential energy is transformed in kinetic energy and vice versa, a mass 4 driven by the energy buffer and moved to one of two end positions, and locking means 21,22 for each of the two end states of the energy buffer. According to the present invention the mass 4 is movable elastically over a predeter mined distance with respect to the energy buffer 1 and with respect to the element, so that when the element reaches one of its end positions the mass can move further over a predetermined distance towards its end position, thus transforming all kinetic in potential energy. Preferably the energy buffer 1 is a helical spring, housed in a cylindrical mass 4 . Each spring end is received in a spring support 2,3 , which rests upon an inward end flange of the mass 4 . Each spring support may cooperate with a stationary stop, mounted on the housing wall, which stop can enter the mass 4 through an opening in the said flanges, to arrest the spring supports 2,3 . The movable element may be formed by one of these spring supports, and may operate the movable switch contact of an electrical switch.
