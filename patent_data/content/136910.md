# AGRICULTURAL TRACTORS

## Abstract
In a tractor 1 having a frame 2, 3 and four wheels 20, 21, 50, 51 , each wheel is driven by a hydrostatic motor 126, 128, 129, 127 and is mounted on an arm 23, 24, 53, 54 which is pivotable relative to the frame. The tractor has a power unit 111 which drives pumps 113, 114, 115, 145, 155 for supplying hydraulic fluid under pressure. Two 113, 114 of said pumps are drive pumps for supplying hydraulic fluid under pressure to respective pairs 126, 127 and 128, 129 of said wheel motors. A hydraulic piston and cylinder device 31, 32, 61, 62 is mounted between the frame and each of said pivotable arms 23, 24, 53, 54 on which the wheels are mounted. One of the cylinder and piston of each of the devices is associated with the frame and the other of the cylinder and piston of the device is associated with the respective pivotable arm. Pump 155 is an auxiliary pump selectively connectible to the piston and cylinder devices 31, 32, 61, 62 so that each device may be activated to pivot a respective arm 23, 24, 53, 54 relative to the frame independ ently of the supply of hydraulic fluid to the wheel motors 126, 128, 129, 127 and thus vary the disposition of the wheel 20, 21, 50, 51 mounted on the arm relative to the frame. The tractor may also incorporate a load carrying platform 91 mounted on an extensible portion 45, 46 of the frame. The frame may have front and rear parts 2, 3 articulated together for relative rotation about substantially vertical 5 and substantially horizontal 6 axes.
