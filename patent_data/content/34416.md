## Description
Filter pleat support means BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention This invention relates to filter elements, and more particularly, to filter elements used in backflushable filter units wherein the filters suffer from premature failure due to the filtering cleaning cycle imposed thereon. The invention comprehends a means for limiting this premature failure by incorporating a novel support system during the manufacturing of the filter.2. Background of the Prior Art The United States Patent No. 3,994,810, a backflushable filter unit having a plurality of filter elements is taught. The filter elements therein are depicted as being cylindrical with pleated filter media being secured to the end caps of the filter elements. The prefer 9 filter media for filtering polymers is mentioned as a metal fibre depth filter media wherein the metal fibres have a diameter from about 1 micron to about 50 microns and the media is sintered. Generally, in the operation of filter units and including backflushable units, the flow of contaminated fluid is usually froni outside the filter element into the centre of the element and then out through the centre of the filter housing. However, in backflushable filter units, the flow is preselectedly reversed so that some of the clean fluid is used for flowing from inside the filter element to its outside thereby cleaning it In such backflushable filter units, the filters are on stream filtering for a preselected period of time and then selectively switched offstream either individually or in pairs being cleaned for a preselected period of time.The cleaning period or time required to clean the filters is dependent upon 1 How dirty the filters are 2 The type of fluid in the system 3 The type of contaminants 4 The amount of pressure drop in the device and 5 The desired level of cleanness. The filtering and cleaning causes the pleated filter media of the filter elements to be subjected to a cyclic pressure effect. It has been found that under certain circumstances, such as a high differential pressure across the filter media and a high viscosity liquid being filtered, that the crowns. of the pleats of some of the elements in a backflushable unit were cracking or splitting such as depicted in the .photograph of Figure 1. it was initially believed that this splitting of the crowns was due to failure of the fastening means that was used to attach the pleated filter media to the end caps. A number of such filter elements were made in accordance with United States PatentNo. 4,169,059 wherein a metal fibre web is used as means for bonding the filter media to the end caps. An extensive evaluation of a plurality of such filter elements, such as those depicted in Figure 1, indicated that the bonding means for securing the pleated filter media to the end caps was fully intact. And, thus, bonding failure was not the cause of the splitting of the crowns. Therefore, the obvious solu tion, making the bond stronger, would not prevent the splitting. Thus, recognition of the splits in the crowns and the review of the prior art did not lead one to any con clusipn1 S..... 0T how to solve the splitting problem.. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to filter elements, and more particularly, filter elements that are used in backflush able filtering units with the invention hereof fully contemplating a means for preventing the crowns of the pleats of the filter elements from cracking because they are subjected to repeated cycles of filtering and cleaning. The cracking of the crowns is solved by two distinct and unique methods. It is therefore an object of this invention to provide a filter element with improved properties whereby it will not split in the crowns when subjected to the cyclic phenomena inherent in a backflushable filter system. It is another object of this invention to provide such a filter element with support means positioned between the crown and the pleats of the filter element to prevent the splitting of the crowns. It is another object of this invention to provide for a filter element with spacers located between the pleats and the crowns to prevent the splitting of the crowns. It is still yet another objec.t of this invention to provide such a. filter element having spacers which are E shaped that are located between then outer pleats and spacer shims that may be E shaped located between the inner pleats. Still yet another object of this invention is the provision whereby the spacers may be comb shaped or corrugated. And still another object of this invention is to provide such a filter element with support means located between the inner pleat apexes and the inner diameter of the filter end cap, The above and other and further objects and features will be more readily understood by reference to the following detailed description and accompanying drawings.

DESCRIPTION OF TilE PItEFEltlED EMBODIMENTS A small perspective representation of a filter element is shown in Figure 2 with Figure 3 depicting a segment of the lower portion of the filter element of Figure 2 taken along line B B. The filter media 20 has pleats 27 with crowns 21 and apexes 22.The filter media 20 is secured to the end caps 11. and 12 by bonding means 19 such as taught in United StatesPatent No. 4,114,794 The upper end cap 11 has a forward lip 13 and an inner lip 15 with gap 17 between the apexes 22 and lip 15. And, the lower cap 12 has a forward lip 14 and an inner lip 16 with gap 18 between the apex 22 and the lip 16. The crown 21 is extremely close to the forward lips 13 and 14 and in some instances when the bonding means 19 actually falls over the edge of the lip the very top edge of the crown 22 can be secured at 21a and 21b. The filter element 10 will be of any size compatible with the filter housing used to hold it. It was found after the invention herein that when the filter element 10 is normally filtering in a backflushable filter unit such as that taught by UnitedStates Patent No. 3,994,810 that the filter media 20 appears to balloon slightly inward such as shown inFigure 5. In fact, in a backflushable unit where fluid is forced both ways through the filter media, it is thought that such filter media pleats 27 act as diaphragms wherein the adjacent pleats 27 those separated by apexes 22 are forced apart during the normal filtering cycle. The arrows in Figure 5 represent the fluid flowing through the filter media. When the flow is reversed nnd the filter is being backflushed or cleaned, the filter media pleats 27 again those separated by apexes 22 are forced together such as shown inFigure 6 the arrows indicating the path of the flow of the fluid.Thus, the filtering and backflushing cycle causes the pleats 27 to move in and out, mostly at their centre 28, in a diaphragmic movement without breaking their seal with the bonding means to the end caps. The top crown 21a and bottom crown 21b are restricted from movement due to the relative closeness to and support provided by lips 13 and 14. It is therefore believed that the location of maximum stress due to this diaphragmic movement is located in the crown 21 and possibly at the centre 21c. This diaphragmic movement seems to prematurely cause one or more of the crowns to split open when the fluid passing through the filter unit has a high viscosity and there.is a high pressure drop across the filter materialThe photograph of Figure 1 depicts a portion of part of a filter element used in a backflushable filter unit such as the backflushable unit shown in United StatesPatent No. 31994,880. A cross sectional view of a split crown 21 similar to that shown in Figure 1 is shown inFigure 6 at 40. When this split occurs, the filter unit becomes inoperable because contaminated fluid. can pass through this breach without being filtered. It has been ascertained that the splitting crowns will.occur more when fluid having a viscosity of approximately 100 poise or more is being filtered and the pressure drop across the filter media is about 100 psia or more. In a typical construction of the backflushable element 10 as shown in partial cross section in Figure 3 the filter media 20 can be made from a metal fibre web material that is sintered. This filter media 20 may be faced on it.s. outer surface 23 by an outer metal wire screen 30. Sometimes, the media 20 may also be faced on the inner surface 24 by a metal wire screen 31. These wire screens 30 and 31 are generally lightweight metal screens typically, these screens are 24 x 24 mesh made of 11 mil wire, 16 x 16 mesh made of 18 mil wire and 10 x 10 wire mesh made from 25 mil wire. Expanded metal sheets having a thickness of from about 20 mils to about 30 mils may be substituted for the metal screen wire. The size,of the screen or expanded metal is predicated on 1 the size of the filter element, 2 the number of. pleats of the element and 3 the size of a pleat in order to be compatible therewith. Quite surprisingly, it has been found, as a preferred embodiment of the invention that an antibellowing means prevents the diaphragmic movement of the pleats and may comprise a three dimensional wedge 100 or shim 101 that can be placed adjacent the outer surface 23 of the medium 20. The wedge 100 is depicted in Figure 7 and the shim 101 is depicted in Figure 7A.In Figure 11, the wedge 100 is shown between the outer surface 23 of the pleats 27, although the shim 101 can be substituted therefor. It has been found desirable to have the metal wire screen 30 exterior to the outer surface 23 of the media 20. The screen 30 provides a three dimensional structure on the exterior of the surface 23 with the woven characteristics of the screen providing a flow path between the wedge 100 and the outer surface 23. The wedge controls and substantially reduces the outer movement of the media 20, and more particularly, prevents outward movement of the centre 28 of the pleat 27 when the filter element ilackflushable filter element and mounted in a backflush mode. Since the pleats 27 are usually formed around a cylindrical core, the space between crowns 21 is tapered to a greater extent than the space between the apexes 22.Thus, a wedg . shaped spacer 100 fits tighter into the space than a flat shim. It has been satisfactorily ascertained that the wedge 100 positioned between the outer surface 23 of the pleats 27 provides a unique means for prolonging the life of a backflushable filter element. In addition to the wedge 100 positioned between the pleats 27 of the outer surface, as shown in Figure 12, the shims 101 are positioned between the pleats 27 at the inner surface 24. The metal wire screen 31 performs the same function as the screen 30. The shim 101 supports and substantially prevents diaphragmic movement of the pleated media 20 during the regular filtering cycle. With both the wedge 100 and shim 101 facing each pleat 27, the filter media can be subjected to repeated cleaning cycles with fluids having viscosities of 1,000 poise and even more. It has been found that it is not essential that the wedge 100 or shim 101 be secured to the end caps 11 and 12. However, the wedges 100 and shims 101 must be selected from material that is compatible with the media 20 and screens 30 and 31 if they are used . In the event that the media 20, screens 30 and 31, wedges 100 and shims 101 are all of the same material or material system, then it is possible that the wedges 100 and or shims 101 may be secured to either one or both of the end9apQbythebondi igmeans 19. By choosing the wedge 100 and or shim 101 material properly, or by providing special coatings thereon, it is possible to predetermine whether or not the wedge 100 or shim 101 can be or will be secured to the end caps 11 or 12. In another embodiment of the invention, shown in Figure 8, an E shaped wedge 102 is depicted and inFigure 9 an E shaped shim 103 is depicted. The E shaped wedge 102 and shims 103 are spacers that can be substituted for the wedges 100 and shims 101 to provide for greater unobstructed flow through the filter than the solid wedges and shims. The E shaped spacers also provide for less pressure drop across the filter element and, thus, require less energy to force the contaminated fluid through the filter media 20. For most efficient use of the E shaped spacers, the solid vertical segment of the E is closest to the inner portion of the crowns 21 and the apexes 22. The Eshaped spacers are positioned similar to the wedges 100 and shims 101 spacers shown in Figures 11 and 12. In another embodiment of the invention comb like wedges and shims 105, 106 and 107 are shown in Figures 13, 14 and 15. Instead of having a three prong and two space comb arrangement E shaped , as shown in Figures 8 and 9, the wedges and shims can have a plurality of teeth and spacers, as desired.Obviously the number of teeth and the size thereof are determined by the size of the filter element and the characteristics of the fluid to be filtered For a filter pleat 27 ranging from about one square inch to about two square inches, it has been found desirable to have the teeth and spacers each about 1 16 inch to 1 8 inch wide dimension a in Figure 13 . In one preferred embodiment, the teeth and spacers are each 3 32 inch 93 mils wide. In.yet another embodiment of the invention, as shown in Figure 10, a corrugated spacer 108 can be substituted for the wedge 100 and for the shim 101.In fact, it is fully contemplated that more than one type of spacer can be used in one filter element at a time if desired. Quite surprisingly, in another embodiment of the invention Åa ring 70, as shown in Figures 16 and 18, is positioned in gap 18 between the inner lip 16 and the bottom of the apex 22. A circular ring 70 is split and forced into the gap 18. The ring is then spot welded at 80 to the lip 16 to maintain its position relative to the gap 18 and the apexes 22. The ring 70 can touch the edge of the apexes 22 or the screen 31 or be spaced slightly from the apexes, as desired. The assembly of the filter element 10 and the pleated filter media 20 and the screens 30 and 31 are generally positioned with a tolerance ranging from 1 32 inch to as much as 6 1 8 inch, depending upon the size of the filter. It has been found advantageous to have the ring 70 as close to the apexes 22 as possible. Thus, after the filter media 20 and screens 30 and 31, if used is assembled into the end caps 11 and 12 and before the bonding of the media to the end caps and the ring 70 is positioned and spot welded to the lip 16, the ring 70 will usually contact most of the apexes 22. In another embodiment of the invention, as shown in Figure 17, a second ring 71 is used in the other gap 17. The results achieved from the invention hereof are quite surprising and cannot be fully explained by the inventor. The reason for the synergistic effect of a metal ring 70 adjacent the inner lip 16 and the apexes 22 to prevent the crowns 21 from slitting is unknown at this time.
