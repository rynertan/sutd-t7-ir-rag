## Abstract
The underwater apparatus for inspecting a submerged object comprises an underwater vehicle 14 capable for transporting humans and equipment to a submerged object 12 . In order to enable the interior of the object 12 to be inspected, a portable acoustic probe 16 is provided. The housing of the probe 16 contains in addition a light source and a television camera. The diver carries a package 20 with the transmitter and receiver for the ultrasonic transducer array and some acoustical image electronics. At the rear of the probe 16 is located a display so that the diver may obtain a visual image of the acoustical information. The probe 16 , the diver and the underwater vehicle 14 are interconnected by a cable 22 . The operator within the craft 14 may visually monitor both the acoustical and the optical image display. Means are provided for storing the electrical signals in the vehicle 14 .
