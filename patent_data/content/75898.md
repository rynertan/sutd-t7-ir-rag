## Description
The present invention concerns a process for the preparation of cardboards of the corrugated type, endowed with a high resistance to humidity, by using for the purpose thermoplastic polymer fibres. According to a process already known to the Prior Art, as described in Belgian Patent No. 866,781 in the name of the same Applicant, it is possible to obtain a cardboard of the above described type by using as paper to form the liners or flat covers and the undulated element, synthetic thermoplastic fibre sheets or sheets made of mixtures of cellulose fibres with said thermoplastic fibres. Said sheets may be heat treated in order to melt at least part of the thermoplastic fibres. Such a heat treatment may be carried out in the absence of pressure, for instance in a hot air tunnel, or by means of I.R. lamps, and possibly followed up by a compression stage or else it may be achieved by a contemporaneous pres sure, for instance, by operating on cylinder calanders, on which the pressure may be exerted by one of the cylinders or in flat plate discontinuous presses, or on continuous 2 ribbon presses, with a pressure value of at least 0.1 kg cm in the calander cylinder presses, and with at least 0.1 2 kg cm on the plate or ribbon presses. In the case in which the sheets are used for producing the undulated or corrugated surface of the cardboard, they are thermoformed on suitably heated embossed or fluted cylinders which form the so called undulating group , well known to the skilled in the Art of corrugated cardboard manufacturing, even of the traditional type. The cylinders of the undulating or corrugating group work in general at temperatures greater than the temperature at which the thermoplastic polymer, constituting the synthetic fibres present in the sheets, plasticizes or becomes soft, wherefore the sheets may acquire in a permanent way the required undulated structure. In general, the first of the liners that form the undulated cardboard, is welded onto the tips of the wave in the undulating or corrugating group itself by thermofusion of the thermoplastic fibres contained in said liner, while the second liner is welded to the opposite tips of the wave in a separated operation. The thermowelding and heat treatment of the sheets, in particular of the sheet that constitutes the wave, with the consequencial fusion melting of the theranplastic fibres therein contained, allow to obtain a corrugated type cardboard of high mechanical properties under humidity. In the realization of this process there are met, however, considerable practical difficulties or drawbacks during the stage of the thermo welding of the liners to the wave, whether said welding is applied by the corrugating or undulat ing group or by hot plates, because of the high operational temperatures which, in general, are by 20 C to 300C greater than the melt temperature of the thermoplastic polymer present in the liners, wherefore these latter tend to cause a certain degrading of the cellulose and, in the specific case of the operation with heated plates, they will cause the collaps of the undulation at the minimum pressure requested 2 about 40 g cm . It has now been found by the same Applicants, and it forms the object of this invention, a process that will allow the preparation of an undulated type cardboard by using a thermoplastic polymeric material, with the possibility of achieving the thermo adhesion of the liners to the wave element at relatively low temperatures, such as to avoid the greatest part or to altogether eliminate the aforesaid drawbacks. Said process consists in using, as constituents of the wave and of the liners, sheets consisting of or comprising two superimposed layers, one being made of cellulose fibres, while the other, adhering to the former, is made of a fibrous material, at least 5S by weight of which is made up a thermoplastic synthetic polymer in then putting the .liner into contact, by means of the layer of cellulose fibres, with the tips or peaks of the wave formed by the layer of cellulose fibres, with interposed between the liner and above said tips a thermoplastic polymer film having the hereunder defined characteristics and in finally heating up, preferably under a certain pressure, the composite product thus obtained, at least in correspondence with the contact points of the liner with the tips or peaks of the waves, at a temperature comprised between a temperature greater by 1OOC than the melting or fusing temperature of the thermoplastic polymer constituting the film, and a temperature greater by 200C than the melting temperature of the thermoplastic polymer that constitutes the synthetic fibres present both in the liner as well as in the wave. The thermoplastic polymer that forms the film to be interposed between the layer of cellulose fibres of the liner and the tips or peaks of the wave must possess the following characteristics a a melt temperature lower than the melt temperature of the polymer forming the synthetic thermoplastic fibres present in the layers adhering to the layers of cellulose sic fibres of the liner and of the wave, and destined to adhere, and between which is inserted the film b a viscosity in the molten state, measured in a capillary viscosimeter, under a velocity gradient equal to or 1 lower than 10 seconds, and at a temperature comprised between a temperature greater by 10 0C than the melt tem perature of said thermoplastic polymer and temperature greater by 20 0C than the melt temperature of the above mentioned synthetic thermoplastic fibres, lower than i. o8 poises, but preferably lower than 1.10 poises c a surface tension not greater by 5 dine cm than the sur face tension of the polymer forming said thermoplastic fibres, measured at the same temperature d a solubility parameter that is in a relationship with the solubility parameter of the polymer that forms said thermoplastic fibres, in a ratio of between 0.85 and 1.15, extremes inclusive, said parameters being measured at 25 C. The presence of a film of such characteristics, interpos ed between the cellulosic layer of the liner and the tips or peaks of the wave, they too formed by a layer of cellulosic fibres, together with the presence of the layers of thermoplastic fibres immediately adjacent to the two above mention ed cellulose layers, allow to achieve the adhesion between liner and the tips of the wave at lower temperatures or, at equal temperature, to obtain higher adhesion values than in the case of the adhesion between liner and the wave formed of non composite cellulose layers or sheets by means of the fusion or melting of a generic thermoplastic film interposed between the liners and the wave. More particularly, it is possible and even preferable, with the above described method, to operate at a temperature greater by 100C than the melt temperature of the film forming polymer, and at a temperature equal to the melt temperature of the polymer that constitutes the thermoplastic fibres present in the layer of the wave, to be made to adhere by means of the thermoplastic film, when the melt temperature of the polymer forming the film is lower by at least 100C than the melt temperature of the polymer that forms said thermoplastic fibres. With temperature values comprised in said preferred range of temperatures, it is possible to obtain the adhesion also at temperatures lower than the melt temperature of said thermoplastic fibres, without destroying however the morphology of said fibres. As far as the fibrous material that forms the layer adhering to the layer of cellulosic fibres in the sheets forming the liners and the wave, is concerned, said fibrous material may consist only of synthetic fibres of at least one thermoplastic polymer, or of blends or mixtures of such fibres with up to 95 by weight on the total mixture of fibres, of fibres of another type, but preferably cellulose fibres. Mineral fillers, pigments and additives usually used in conventional cellulosic papers, may be present in the two layers forming each sheet, admixed to the constituent fibrous material. Obviously, the sheets constituting the liners and the wave, to be made to adhere on the side of their corresponding cellulosic layers, may consist of more than the two above described fibrous layers, provided that in each one of said composite sheets there be present an outside layer formed of cellulose fibres which layer is the one destined to adhere , and immediately adhering to said layer, a layer formed of fibres of a synthetic thermoplastic polymer, or formed of a mixture of said fibres having up to 95 by weight of other fibres, but preferably cellulosic fibres.The remaining layers that constitute the composite sheet may be indifferently formed of synthetic fibres, either thermoplastic or non thermoplastic, or only of cellulosic fibres, or blends of such said fibres in any wanted proportion. More particularly, the sheet constituting the wave may consist of three layers, of which the mid one internal one consists of fibrous material made up of at least 5 by weight of synthetic fibres of a thermoplastic polymer, while the two external outside layers are constituted of cellulosic fibres. In this way both series of wave tips will turn out to consist of one layer of cellulosic fibres and could thus be each coupled with a liner, through the layer of cellulosic fibres of this latter, by means of the above specified thermoplastic polymer and according to the above described pro cedures. In figure I are illustrated and respectively marked 1, 2 and 3, the sheet forming the liner , the wavy or undulated element and the assembly of wavy element and liner, made to adhere to each other through cellulosic layers a by means of thermoplastic film c . b marks the layer of fibrous material consisting of at least 5 by weight of synthetic thermoplastic fibres. In figure II are illustrated and marked 2 and 3 respectively, the 3 layered wavy sheet, the three layers being marked respectively a , b and a , where a and b have the same meaning as that specified in Fig. I and c marks the thermoplastic films serving to bind together the two liners 1 to the wavy sheet 3 . As far as the thermoplastic film, that should be interposed between the cellulosic layers of the composite sheets, is concerned, said film must have a thickness of at least 20 , but in general should be comprised between 20 1A and 200 More particularly, especially advantageous adhesion conditions, both with regard to low temperatures that may be used as well as for the adhesion values achieved, may be realized when operating with sheets in which the layer of cellulosic fibres only, serving for the binding of the other layers to each other, has a specific weight of between 40 and 120 g m2 in correspondence of an apparent density of between 0 6 and 0.8 g.tcc, and by interposing between the cellulosic layers of the two sheets a thermoplastic film having a thickness comprised between 20 and 40 microns. Density values for the layer of cellulosic fibres comprised between 0.6 and 0.8 g cc, may be obtained by carrying out a suitable refining of the cellulose fibres used for the purpose, according to the known techniques of the Prior Art. The specific weight of the layer of the sheet consisting of or containing at least 5 by weight of thermoplastic 2 fibres, must amount to at least 20 g m , but should prefer 2 ably be comprised between 40 and 120 g m The preparation of said composite sheets may be achieved by means of the conventional paper preparation methods, starting from aqueous dispersions or some other inert liquid, of cellulose fibres, or of synthetic thermoplastic fibres or blends thereof with cellulosic fibres, us ing continous flat plate or curved plane machines. Preferably there are used aqueous suspensions containing from 0.3 to 1.5 by weight of fibrous material. The preparation of the assembly or combination of the wavy sheet with a single face liner, according to the method of this invention, consisting in the steps of interposition of the thermoplastic film between the liner forming cellulose layers and the tips of the wave, the heating and compression, may be carried out in one single operation on the undulating corrugating group, by feeding to this latter, between the liner and the tips of the wave that has been formed, the thermoplastic polymer film. For the application of a second liner to the single facet liner thus obtained, it is possible to work on the hot plates by using the thermoplastic film and operating under the above described operational conditions, or by using other methods of continuous or intermittent welding. As synthetic thermoplastic fibres to be used in the process of this invention, there may be used fibres of the traditional type in the form of staples, but preferably there are used fibrils or fibrids of thermoplastic synthetic poly 2 mers having a specific surface area of at least 1 m g. Said fibrils or fibrids are products long known to the skilled in the Art as substituents for cellulose in the preparation of paper or kindred products. They generally display a length comprised between 1 and 10 mm, with a mean apparent diameter of between I and 500 microns. The fibrils usable in the present process may be obtained according to anyone of the numerous processes described in the tedmical literature. In this connection, there may be cited the methods described in British Pat.s Nos. 868,651 and 1,287,917, and in German Pat. Appl. No. 2,208,553, according to which the mentioned fibres, otherwise called fibrids , are obtained by precipitation of the polymers from their solutions, or else in the course of the polymerization itself of the monomers, operating in the presence of shearing stresses and, moreover, described in Brit. Pat. Nos. 891,943 and 1,263,531 US Pat. Nos. 3,770,856, 3,750,383 and 3,808,091 Belgian Pat. No. 789,808 and French Pat. No. 2,176,858 as well as in German Pat. Appl.No. 2,343,543, in which the above mentioned fibrils are obtained in the state of more or less coherent aggregates, or of filament like structures, fibrilled plexofilaments by means of extrusion through a spinneret of solutions, emulsions or dispersions of polymers into one or more liquid media, under almost instantaneous evaporation conditions of the liquid phase present flash spinning process . In such a case the fibrous aggregates or plexofilaments thus obtained may be easily disgregated to discontinuous or elementary fibrils possessing a specific 2 surface area of at least 1 m g, by means of cutting and or refining operations. Other processes, by which it is possible to directly obtain fibrils suited for use in the process of the present invention, are those described in Italian Pat. Nos. 947,919 and 1,030,809 filed in the name of the same Applicant, as well as in Brit. Pat. Nos. 1,353,912 and 1,355,913. The thermoplastic fibres, and in particular the fibrils or fibrids, may contain incorporated inorganic fillers such as for instance kaolin, talc, titanium dioxide, etc., in quantities of up to 708 by weight of the fibres thus loaded. Blends of said fibrils with thermoplastic fibres of the conventional type may also be used. As cellulosic fibres there may be used all those fibres which are normally used for preparing paper of the traditional type, based on cellulose or its derivatives. In the layers of the composite sheets there may be present as partial substituents less than 50 of the cellulose fibres, also natural fibres of another type for instance wool, asbestos as well as glass fibres. when the thermoplastic fibres, which partially or totally constitute the layer adhering to the layer of cellulose fibres destined to the adhesion, are blends of different polymeric fibres, the polymer forming the film to be interpos ed between the sheets, must satisfy conditions from a to d as previously herein above defined, with regard to at least one of the types of thermoplastic fibres present or of the polymer constituting said fibres . In the case single thermoplastic fibres consist of a mixture of polymers, instead of only one type of polymer, what it said at points a to d about the melt temperatures, the superficial tension values and the solubility parameters of the polymers constituting the fibres, must be intended as referring to the corresponding values possessed by said mixtures of polymers. The thermoplastic polymer forming the film may be any film forming thermoplastic polymer, preferably displaying a cristallinity of at least 20 , provided that it shows the characteristics defined at points from a to d , with respect to the polymeric material constituting the thermoplastic fibres present in the sheets. Examples of polymers from which a film may be obtained, are olefinic polymers such as polyethylene and polypropylene vinyl polymers such as polyvinyl chloride, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl acetate, polymethylacrylate, polystyrene, polyamides, polytetrafluoroethylene, polyester resins and the mixtures of such polymers. As melt temperature for the polymers there should be applied the temperature at which, at the optical microscope, there will be observed the disappearance in the polymer of the last crystallite. The solubility parameter of a polymer in the expression the square root of the relationship between the cohesion energy of the molecules and the molar volume, and is often used for determining the compatibility of polymers and solvents. General methods for its determination are described byJ. Bandrup E.G. Immergut in Polymer Handbook , Intersc.Publisher, 1966, paragr. 4, page 341 and following pages. A particular method for determination, based on the additive principle of the contributes of chemical groups, atoms and bonds links present in the molecules, to the total attractive molar forces, has been suggested and descry ed by P.A. Small in Journal of Applied Chemistry No. 3, p. 77, 1953. In the following there will be found the values of solubility parameters at 250C, of a number of polymers, calculated according to P.A. Small and to which reference is made for the purpose of this invention.Polymer Solubility parameterEMI12.1 Polyvinyl acetate 9.22 Polymethylmetacrylate 9.22 Polyethylene 8.05Polystyrene 9.01 Polypropylene 9.2Polytetrafluoroethylene 6.2Polyvinyl alcohol 12.6 Polyvinyl chloride 10.2 The thermoplastic polymer film may be obtained accord ing to anyone of the traditional methods used for the film forming of polymers such as extrusion, casting, etc. By referring to the sheets forming the liners and the wave, it can be said that the thermoplastic synthetic fibres present in the layer adhering to the cellulosic layer that must be made to adhere, according to the process of this invention, are preferably derived from thermoplastic polymers having at least a 208 crystallinity, such as for instance low or high density polyethylene, polypropylene essentially consisting of isotactic macromolecules the ethylene propylene copolymers, whether statistical or in blocks poly 4 methyl 1 pentene polyamides polycarbonates the vinyl resins such as polyvinyl chloride and polyvinyl acetate ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers acrylic resins in general polyesters. For the heating operation on the composite structure formed in succession by the liner, the thermoplastic film and the wavy sheet, when realized in the absence of pressure, there may be used, for instance, either a hot air tunnel or a hot cylinder. However, when operating under pressure instead, there may be uSed either a press or a calander consisting of a roller of hard material, for instance, of steel. Preferably, but not necessarily, one operates on calanders working with pressures comprised between 10 and 100 2 kg cm As indicated previously herein above, the temperature at which the heating operation is carried out, is comprised between a temperature greater by 10 C than the melt temperature of the polymer forming the film, and a temperature grea ter by 20 C with respect to the melt temperature of the thermoplastic fibres present in the layer of sheets adhering to the layer of cellulosic sheets intended for adhesion. The actual temperature at which the treatment will be conducted, shall be chosen, in that range or interval, amongst the temperatures at which the polymer constituting the film will assume the previously established values of viscosity b and superficial tensiqn c , incase said values should not occur at all the heating temperatures comprised in that temperature interval. In such a case, the temperature at which to carry out the coupling, can be established on the basis of preliminary determinations of the viscosity and superficial tension carried out on the polymer of the film. The process, object of the present invention, allows to obtain cardboards of any specific weight..Moreover, the cardboards thus obtained, at equal specific weight, with respect to those made of cellulose only, or of a mixture cellulose synthetic thermoplastic fibres, display superior mechanical characteristics in the dry, although preserving the same thermoforming capacity of these latter, also at higher specific weights. The process is, moreover, applicable, with the same substantial advantages, to the coupling of liners to the wave, in which liners the thermoplastic synthetic fibres present in the layer adhering to the cellulosic one destined to the adherence, have been previously thermomelted by heating and by possible simultaneous or successive compression of the sheets, and have thereby lost their fibrous morpholo gy. The following examples are given for further illustratE ing the inventive idea of this invention, without, however, limiting in anyway the scope of the invention itself.EXAMPLE 1On a two jet paper machine, and using respectively a an aqueous 4 dispersion of Kraft cellulose, refined up to 230 SR b a 4 aqueous dispersion of a fibrous blend consisting of 35 by weight of Kraft cellulose and of 65 by weight of polyethylene fibrils of the high density type having a m.p. 1300C , with a weight mean length of 3 mm, an apparent diameter of 17 and a specific 2 surface area of 6 m g, with a superficial pre treat merit in order to promote its dispersion in water, with acetylized polyvinyl alcohol, according to the process described in Italian Pat.No. 1,006,878, two composite sheets were prepared, each consisting of a layer of cellulose fibres having, after drying, a weight of 2 100 g m , a thickness of 160 A corresponding to a specific density of 0.625 g cc , and by a layer of polyethylene fibrils mixed with cellulose fibres having, after drying, a 2 specific weight of 80 g m and a thickness of 145 microns. The two composite sheets were then conveyed to an undulating or corrugating group, together with a 20 thick film con sisting of a low density polyethylene d 0.906 g cc showing a melt point of 110 C. Said polyethylene, within the temperature range of 1200C 0 5 155 C, shows a viscosity below 0.8 10 poises, measured on a capillary viscosimeter, under a velocity gradient lower than or equal to 10 seconds, and a surface tension equal to that of the high density polyethylene that forms the fibrils, whil showing a solubility parameter in a ratio of 0.98 with that of the polymer of the fibrils.In figure III, there are shown an undulating or corrugating group and the arrangement of the composite sheets and of the film, for the preparation of the liner wave single face assembly.In said figure III, there is shown sheet 1 that forms the liner together with the cellulosic layer a and the cellulose thermoplastic fibres mixture layer b , sheet 3 destined to form the undulated or corrugated wavy sheet on the undulat ing group with layers a and b the embossed rollers 4 and 5 which turn revolve in the direction shown by the yarrows and which in their whole constitute the undulating group the polymer film 2, which is interposed between liner 1 and the tips of the wavy element or sheet on roller 5 the I.R. pre heater 7, for the polymeric film the wave thermowelded to the liner.In figure III, by letter R are furthermore marked the feed rollers from which unwind the sheets or above mentioned filmsThe temperature of the undulating group amounts to 140 C 2 , while the exerted pressure is equal to 80 kg cm.The product obtained single face was subjected to adhesion tests of the liner to the wave tips. For that purpose a 5 cm wide strip of single face liner, 25 cm long, was cut off.The liner was then manually separated from the wave, starting from the short side. The ends of paper were then inserted into che clamps of an INSTRON dynamometer, which were then moved apart at a rate of 1 cm second. The adhesion force liner to wave was determined on at least 10 adhesion lines or points between liner and wave.In this particular instance the adhesion, as the mean value of 10 measurements, proved to be equal to 530 120 g cm.EXAMPLE 2A composite single face wave liner was prepared operating as in example 1, but with the difference that for the wave element and for the liner , there were used simple Kraft cellulose sheets 288 micron thick and with a specific weight 2 of 180 g cm , corresponding to an apparent density of 0.625 g cc.The thermoplastic film and the other operational conditions were just like in example 1. The adhesion between liner and the wave tips was equal to 180 30 g cm.
