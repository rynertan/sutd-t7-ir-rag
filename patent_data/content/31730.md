# THE IMPROVED SEMIPERMEABLE COMPOSITE MEMBRANES AND PROCESS FOR THEIR PRODUCTION

## Abstract
A process for producing a semipermeable composite membrane which comprises forming on a microporous substrate a thin layer of a polymeric material comprising a polyamino polymer containing at least 1 milliequivalent, per gram of the polymer in the dry state, of active amino groups selected from primary amino groups and secondary amino groups, and thereafter interfacially crosslinking a surface portion of said thin layer with a crosslinking agent having at least two functional groups a capable of easily reacting with either the primary or secondary amino groups or both in said polymer characterised in that 1 said polymeric material contains dispersed therein a polyfunctional compound having at least two functional groups b substantially incapable of reacting with the primary or secondary amino groups in said polymer at a temperature at which the interfacial crosslinking is carried out, but capable of reacting easily with either the primary or secondary amino groups or both in said polymer at a temperature at least 30 C higher than said crosslinking temperature, and 2 the interfacially crosslinked thin layer is heated to a temperature at which said polyfunctional compound reacts with the primary or secondary amino groups or both in said polymer. The resulting membranes have excellent durability, very good water flux and salt rejection.
