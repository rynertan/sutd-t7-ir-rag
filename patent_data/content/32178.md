# Micro helix thermo capsule.

## Abstract
A closed two phase liquid vapor heat transfer device is provided which is independent of orientation and requires no wick 5 . A helix bellows container 10 contains a liquid coolant. Heat input at the evaporator section of the container 10 results in evaporation of the coolant. The vapor flows through the bellow and condenses on the cold end where heat is released. Coolant in the evaporator section is replenished by flow through capillary passages 14 formed by the convolution of the bellow.
