## Description
Human lung carcinomas are responsible for most deaths from cancer among men and are in the process of overtaking breast carcinomas as the most frequent cause of cancer death among women Cancer Facts and Figures, 1983 . This disease can be divided into 4 major histological types, i.e., epidermoid 30 , adenocarcinoma 35 , large cell undifferentiated 15 , and small cell 20 . Most cases of lung carcinomas are incurable by chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Small cell lung carcinomas may respond to chemotherapy and radiation therapy by a reduction in size, but not a total cure. Complete surgical removal of the tumor appears to be the only effective therapy. Unfortunately, however, fewer than 30 of lung cancer patients have tumors which can be totally resected at diagnosis and of these, fewer than one third survive 5 years after apparent complete surgical removal of all tumor. There is a great need, therefore, for methods that would make possible an earlier diagnosis of lung cancer, a better definition of the degree of cancer spread, and a more effective therapy. Monoclonal antibodies may be used for all these purposes. A prerequisite, however, is to find antibodies to antigens that are more strongly expressed in lung cancer than in normal adult tissues. In view of the known heterogeneity of tumor cell populations, the presence of several determinants on the same antigen molecule, the anticipated differences between antigens with respect to their suitability as diagnostic markers as compared to therapeutic targets, and the different biological characteristics of different antibodies to the same antigen, a number of different antibodies may be needed. Human monoclonal antibodies to lung cancer antigens are described by Sikora Mouse monoclonal antibodies to glycolipid ganglio N triosylceramide asialo GM₂ are described by Young, U.S. Patent 4737579 discloses certain monoclonal antibodies for human non small cell lung carcinoma. Continuous cultures of fused cells secreting antibody of predefined specificity are described by Köhler Huang et al. 1983 , Arch. Biochem. Bisphys. describe monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridomas prepared from BALB c mice immunized with an established line of human small cell lung cancer NCI 69 . The monoclonal antibodies define a determinant called lacto N fucopentaose III which is expressed on most human small cell lung carcinomas and to a lesser extent on adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the lung and not at all on large cell lung carcinoma. . . ., The present invention is concerned with novel monoclonal antibodies which define a determinant site on a glycolipid antigen associated with human non small cell lung carcinoma NSCLC cells. The term NSCLC cells includes epidermoid carcinoma cells, adenocarcinoma cells, and large cell undifferentiated carcinoma cells. The determinant site may also be found on antigens of some other carcinomas, e.g., some carcinomas of the breast, and, thus, the antibodies of the invention will also bind to these other carcinoma cells. The present monoclonal antibodies bind to a much lesser degree to normal adult cells than to tumor cells. The term bind to a much lesser degree means that the binding will not be detectable by immunohistological techniques. The monoclonal antibodies are secreted by murine hybridomas. Accordingly, the present invention provides a monoclonal antibody or a Fab, F ab ₂, or Fv fragment thereof, the antigen combining site of which binds to Thus, the invention concerns certain diagnostic methods employing the monoclonal antibodies of the invention. One such method involves the determination of the presence of NSCLC cells in a specimen suspected of containing such cells. The specimen is contacted with the monoclonal antibody, which is capable of distinguishing such cells from other cell types which may be present in the specimen. The contact is carried out under conditions for binding of the antibody to such cells. After contact, the presence or absence of binding of the antibody to the cells in the specimen is determined. This binding is related to the presence or absence of the NSCLC cells in the specimen. Generally, the specimen is contacted with a labeled specific binding partner for the monoclonal antibody. This label is capable of producing a detectable signal. Another diagnostic method involves the localization to a tumor of antibodies or antibody fragments which have been properly labelled e.g. with a radioisotope and are subsequently injected into patients. This method can provide better ways to stage cancer patients with respect to extent of disease and to monitor changes in response to therapy. The invention also has therapeutic applications. The antibodies can react with the above mentioned antigen that is expressed in high concentrations at the tumor cell surface. It can mediate antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity ADCC , that is, it can kill NSCLC cells and certain other human carcinoma cells in the presence of human lymphocytes or macrophages it can activate human compliment so as to, for example, kill NSCLC cells in the presence of human serum. It can also be used as a carrier of various agents which have an anti tumor effect, including, but not restricted to, chemotherapeutic drugs and radioisotopes. The present invention concerns novel antibodies which bind to an antigen on human NSCLC cells and certain diagnostic and therapeutic methods employing these antibodies. The monoclonal antibodies of the invention may be produced according to the standard techniques of Köhler and Milstein, Various techniques exist for enhancing yields of monoclonal antibodies, such as injection of the hybridoma cells into the peritoneal cavity of a mammalian host, which accepts the cells, and harvesting the ascites fluid. Where an insufficient amount of the monoclonal antibody collects in the ascites fluid, the antibody is harvested from the blood of the host. Various conventional ways exist for isolation and purification of the monoclonal antibodies, so as to free the monoclonal antibodies from other proteins and other contaminants see Köhler and Milstein, One monoclonal antibody in accordance with the present invention is designated L6. It defines a cell surface glycolipid antigen which we have identified as characteristic of human NSCLC cells and cells from certain other human carcinomas. On the basis of cross reactions of several known glycolipids with L6 antibody and the reactivity of asialo GalNAc GM₁ with L6 antibody, we have concluded that the L6 glycolipid antigen has the following terminal sequence The L6 antibody also precipitates a protein antigen from biosynthetically labelled NSCLC cells. This antigen is characterized by a band on sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoreses SDS PAGE with a molecular weight of about 20,000 daltons. This antibody is of the IgG2a isotype. It does not bind detectably to normal cells, such as fibroblasts, endothelial cells, or epithelial cells in the major organs. The L6 antibody is produced by the L6 murine hybridoma. Also included within the scope of the invention are useful binding fragments of the above monoclonal antibody such as Fab, F ab ₂, Fv fragments and so forth. The antibody fragments are obtained by conventional techniques. For example, useful binding fragments may be prepared by peptidase digestion of the antibody using papain or pepsin. While the above specific example of the novel antibody of the invention is directed to an antibody binding to specific determinant sites on the respective antigens and being of the IgG2 sub class from a murine source, this is not meant to be a limitation. The above antibody and those antibodies having functional equivalency with the above antibody, whether from a murine source, other mammalian source including human, or other sources, or combinations thereof are included within the scope of this invention, as well as other isotypes. By the term functional equivalency is meant that the antibody is capable of binding to the above described determinant site and capable of competing with a particular antibody of the invention for such site. That is, such antibody, when combined with a specimen containing a cell or cell fragment having such determinant site, will bind to such determinant site and will block an antibody of the invention from binding to such site. The antigen can be purified by conventional methods such as immunoprecipitation as described by Young One method of the invention involves the determination of the presence of a malignant condition in lung tissue and other human tissue by examining the tissue for the presence of a glycolipid antigen having the characteristics of the L6 antigen or of a ganglio N triosylceramide. The term malignant condition refers to the presence of dysplastic including carcinoma A particular example, by way of illustration and not limitation, of a method in accordance with the invention is a method for the detection of tumor cells in excised tissue. The above method is applied to a specimen which is a section of the tumor obtained after removal of the tumor. The tumor that is excised is treated to obtain sections, which treatment initially involves freezing the tumor or tissue, normally freezing immediately after excision. The frozen layer of tissue is then cut into sections using, for example, a cryostat. The section of the tumor obtained as described above is contacted with a monoclonal antibody of the invention and then with a second antibody directed against the above monoclonal antibody, which second antibody is labeled with a detectable label. The excised specimen, e.g., the section of the tumor, is contacted with the first monoclonal antibody under conditions for binding of the antibody to the malignant cells. The incubation is generally conducted in an aqueous medium such as, for example, phosphate buffered saline containing a small amount of sodium azide, in a suitable container such as, for example, a glass petri dish, for a period from about 15 to 30 minutes at a temperature of from about 20 to 30 C. The amount of antibody employed is usually sufficient to provide detectable binding, i.e., to provide a detectable number of immune complexes between the antibody and the determinant or antigenic site in question. Following the incubation, the section is washed to reduce or eliminate non specifically bound antibody and then is examined to observe the above mentioned complexes which result from binding of the monoclonal antibody to the cells of the specimen possessing the antigenic site. The binding is related to the presence of malignant cells in the section. Accordingly, binding is determined, for example, by contacting the specimen with a labeled specific binding partner for the monoclonal antibody. The label is capable of producing a detectable signal and may be a radioactive label, a chromophore such as a fluorescer, an enzyme, or the like. An example of a technique employing the above approach is immunofluorescence staining. In this technique frozen sections of the tumor are fixed on a glass slide with acetone and are incubated with the monoclonal antibody in, for example, a petri dish. After washing with an appropriate buffer such as, for example, phosphate buffered saline, the section is placed on a petri dish and contacted with the labeled specific binding partner for the monoclonal antibody, which may be, for example, a labeled antibody specific for the monoclonal antibody employed. Since, for the most part, the monoclonal antibody will be derived from a murine source, a labeled anti mouse immunoglobulin specific for the monoclonal antibody may be employed. Such immunoglobulins may be raised according to standard techniques by injecting a suitable host with murine antibody, waiting for an appropriate time, and harvesting the anti mouse immunoglobulins from the blood of the injected host. After a second washing of the slide with, for example, an aqueous buffer, the sections may be covered with a fluorescent antibody mounting fluid and a coverslip and then examined with a fluorescence microscope to determine the binding of the monoclonal antibody to the section. The determination of the binding also may include an identification of the location of such binding within the specimen. The binding of the monoclonal antibody to the specimen may also be determined by employing a monoclonal antibody which is covalently conjugated to a label capable of producing a detectable signal, such as a radioactive entity, a chromophore including dyes and fluorescers, or an enzyme. The number of labels employed per antibody is generally determined by the requirements of the diagnostic method in which the labeled antibody is employed and the availability of sites for linking the label to the antibody. Methods for conjugating labels to antibodies and antibody fragments are well known in the art. Such methods may be found in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,220,450 4,235,869 3,935,074 and 3,996,345. Another example of a technique in which the monoclonal antibody of the invention may be employed is immunoperoxidase labeling Sternberger, The antibodies of the invention may be used in a method of determining the presence of a malignant condition, for instance in an exfoliative cell specimen from the lung, such as sputum or in a cervical smear. By the term exfoliative is meant that the specimen comprises isolated cells or clumps of cells obtained by scraping or washing the surface of tissue, which cells are removed individually or in scales or laminae. The exfoliative cell specimen is to be distinguished from excised tissue such as that obtained by biopsy. Contact between the specimen and the antibody is made under conditions for binding of the antibody to the antigenic site. After contact, the presence or absence of binding of the antibody to the antigenic site is determined and is related to the presence of a malignant condition in the lung. To determine the presence of a malignancy in the lung, a sputum sample would provide the exfoliative cell specimen to be used in the method. The method may find utility in the detection of a malignant condition in exfoliative cell specimens from the bronchus, gastro intestinal tract including oral pharynx, mouth, etc. The exfoliative cell specimen is next contacted with the aforementioned antibody under conditions for binding of the antibody to the specific antigenic site in the specimen to form antigen antibody complexes. This antigenic site may be present on cells or cell fragments in the specimen. Generally, the specimen is placed on an appropriate support, such as, for example, a slide, usually glass, or some other suitable material. The exfoliative cell specimen is generally smeared on the slide to provide a thin layer of the specimen on the surface of the slide. The contact between the antibody and the specimen is generally carried out in an aqueous buffered medium. The buffers which may be employed include phosphate, tris, bicarbonate, etc. The pH is related to the nature of the specimen and the antibody, and is generally in the range of from about 5 to 8. The aqueous medium may additionally contain organic polar solvents in an amount of from about 0 to 40 . The organic polar solvents are water soluble and generally have from about 1 to 10 carbon atoms and from about 1 to 4 oxygen atoms. The antibody will be present in the aqueous medium at a concentration of about 1 to 100 µg ml, preferably from about 10 to 20 µg ml. The temperature during the contact of the specimen with the antibody is usually from about 4 to 40 C, preferably about 10 to 30 C. The period of contact is usually from about 15 to 120 minutes, preferably from about 30 to 60 minutes. After the period of contact between the specimen and the antibody, the support is generally treated to remove unreacted antibody. Normally, this is accomplished by washing the support with an aqueous, usually buffered, medium. In general, the amount of wash solution should be sufficient to remove the unreacted antibody. Next, the presence of antibody bound to the antigenic site in the specimen, which binding is related to the presence of a malignant condition at the locus, is observed. That is, the specimen is examined to determine the number of antigen antibody immune complexes formed. It should be noted that in some instances very small numbers of the antigenic site in question may be found in the exfoliative cell specimen. However, in a malignant condition, large numbers of the antigenic site will be present and this latter condition is readily distinguishable by this method over a non malignant condition because a large number of antigen antibody complexes will be measurable where a malignant condition exists. To make the determination of the presence of binding, means for producing a detectable signal is incorporated into the assay system. For example, one may conjugate the antibody employed in the assay to a label which is capable of producing a detectable signal. The label may be a radioactive entity, a chromophore including dyes and fluorescers, an enzyme, or the like. The number of labels employed for the antibody is generally determined by the requirements of the method and the availability of sites for linking the label to the antibody. Alternatively, one may contact the washed slide with a labeled specific binding partner for the antibody, which may be, for example, a labeled antibody specific for the antibody employed. Where the monoclonal antibody is derived from a murine source, a labeled anti mouse immunoglobulin specific for the antibody employed in the method may be used. Such immunoglobulins may be raised according to standard techniques by injecting a suitable host with the monoclonal antibody, waiting for an appropriate time, and harvesting the anti mouse immunoglobulins from the blood of the injected host. When a labeled specific binding partner for the antibody is employed, the slide must be washed again with an aqueous medium prior to examining the slide for fluorescence. To determine the presence of binding between the antibody and the cell specimen where a fluorescer label is used, one may examine the slide for fluorescence, usually employing a fluorescence microscope. Where a label other than a fluorescer is employed, one may examine the slide or the specimen for the formation of a precipitate, a color, or the like. The above description is directed primarily to the use of the antibodies of the invention in immunofluorescence techniques. However, the antibodies of the invention can be used in most assays involving antigen antibody reactions. The assays may be homogeneous or heterogeneous. In a homogeneous assay approach, the specimen may be biological fluid such as serum, urine, and the like or the specimen may be lysed and clarified to remove debris. The immunological reaction usually involves the specific antibody, a labeled analyte, and the sample of interest. The signal arising from the label is modified, directly or indirectly, upon the binding of the antibody to the labeled analyte. Both the immunological reaction and detection of the extent thereof are carried out in a homogeneous solution. Immunochemical labels which may be employed include free radicals, fluorescent dyes, enzymes, bacteriophages, coenzymes, and so forth. In a heterogeneous assay approach, the reagents are usually the specimen, the specific antibody, and means for producing a detectable signal. The specimen is generally placed on a support, such as a plate or a slide, and contacted with the antibody in a liquid phase. The support is then separated from the liquid phase and either the support phase or the liquid phase is examined for a detectable signal employing means for producing such signal. The signal is related to the presence of the analyte in the specimen. Means for producing a detectable signal includes the use of radioactive labels, fluorescers, enzymes, and so forth. Exemplary of heterogeneous immunoassays are the radioimmunoassay, immunofluorescence methods, enzyme linked immunoassays, and the like. For a more detailed discussion of the above immunoassay techniques, see Enzyme Immunoassay, by Edward T. Maggio, CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, Florida, 1980. See also, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 3,690,834 3,791,932 3,817,837 3,850,578 3,853,987 3,867,517 3,901,654 3,935,074 3,984,533 3,996,345 and 4,098,876, which listing is not intended to be exhaustive. The antibodies of the invention can also be employed to image metastic deposits in human patients with NSCLC in a manner analogous to that described for malignant melanoma in The antibodies of the invention may be used therapeutically. Antibodies with the proper biological properties are useful directly as therapeutic agents. Antibody L6 has such a property, since it can, when combined with human lymphocytes or macrophages, mediate antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity ADCC in vitro. That is, it can cause the destruction of human NSCLC cells, as can be detected, for example, by using a technique in which the cancer cells are labelled with ⁵¹Cr and incubated with the lymphocytes and antibody. Analogous studies have been performed with anti melanoma antibodies and have shown that antibodies with high ADCC can inhibit outgrowth of human melanoma in nude mice. Since the L6 antibody is of the IgG2a isotype, it may also be able to activate macrophages Sears, Another therapeutic use of the monoclonal antibody of the present invention is the immunization of a patient with an anti idiotypic antibody raised by using one of the present monoclonal antibodies as an immunogen. Such immunization can induce an active anti tumor activity see, for example, Nepom An attractive aspect of the present invention is that the present antibodies can be combined with other antibodies to NSCLC such as those disclosed in U.S. Patent 4737579. The combination is effective in detecting at least the types of lung carcinomas mentioned above, namely, large cell undifferentiated lung carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and epidermoid carcinoma. The monoclonal antibodies of the invention also define determinant sites on antigens associated with other carcinomas such as breast carcinomas. Consequently, the present antibodies can find use in diagnostic and therapeutic products directed to such carcinomas. The invention is further demonstrated by the following illustrative Examples. A number of procedures employed will be described first. For immunohistological studies on frozen sections, the unlabelled antibody technique of Sternberger in The staining procedure consisted of treating serial sections with either specific or control antibody for 2.5 hr, incubating for 30 min with rabbit anti mouse IgG diluted 1 50, and exposing for 30 min to mouse PAP complex diluted 1 80. After each treatment with antibody, the slides were washed twice in phosphate buffered saline PBS . The immunohistochemical reaction was developed with freshly prepared 0.05 3,3 diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride Sigma, St. Louis, MO and 0.01 hydrogen peroxide in 0.05 M Tris buffer, pH 7.6 for 8 min. Further exposure to a 1 OsO₄ solution in distilled water for 20 min intensified the stain. The sections were rinsed with water, dehydrated in alcohol, cleared in xylene, and mounted on slides. The slides were each read under code and coded samples were checked by an independent investigator. Typical slides were photographed by using differential interference contrast optics Zeiss Nomarski . The degree of antibody staining was evaluated as 0 no reactivity , few positive cells , at least one third of the cells positive , most cells positive , close to all cells strongly positive . Since differences between and 0 staining were less clear cut than between and staining, it was decided to count as positive a staining graded as or greater. Both neoplastic and stroma cells were observed in tumor samples the staining recorded referred to that of the tumor cells, since the stroma cells were not stained at all, or were stained more weakly than the tumor cells. The subcellular localization of antigens was determined by measuring antibody binding to cells before or after permeabilization with non ionic detergent. Antibodies binding to the cell surface of intact cultured cells were identified by either direct binding assays with ¹²⁵I labelled antibody Brown In order to identify protein antigens, lung carcinoma cells were surface radioiodinated or metabolically labelled with ³⁵S methionine. Antigens were isolated from cell lysates by incubation with monoclonal antibody, addition of goat anti mouse IgG, and adsorption to Antibodies were tested for reactivity to glycolipid antigens by incubation with purified glycolipids adsorbed to microtest wells along with cholesterol and lecithin and with thin layer chromatography plates on which glycolipids had been fractionated. Bound antibody was detected by incubation with antiserum to mouse immunoglobulin and radioiodinated protein A. Microtiter wells were incubated with 5 NCS in PBS plus 0.02 NaN₃ and the supernatant was aspirated. Twenty five µl of a suspension of epidermal cells 2x10⁷ cells ml were added to each well and incubated with 25 µl of a particular antibody for 1 hr at room temperature. The plates were centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 7 min, washed twice with 50 NCS PBS NaN₃ and 25 µl ¹²⁵I staphylococcal protein A about 50,000 cpm 25 l were added. The plates were incubated for 1 hr at 25 C, washed twice with 5 NCS PBS NaN₃ and dried. The bottom of the wells were cut off and counted in a gamma counter. Monoclonal antibodies were produced by immunizing 3 month old BALB c mice with human tissues of one of four different sources 1 pleural effusions from patients with metastic non small cell lung carcinoma, 2 cultured cells from a non small cell lung carcinoma, and 3 lung tissue from 3 4 months old human embryos. The immunizations were performed by injecting the mice intraperitoneally 3 4 times with approximately 10⁷ cells. Three days after the last immunization, the spleens were removed, suspended in culture medium and fused with NSl mouse myeloma cells Köhler and Milstein, Supernatants from hybrid cells were screened by using both an ELISA assay and an autoradiographic indirect ¹²⁵I labelled protein A assay Brown Hybridomas which produced antibodies binding to the cell membrane extracts were cloned, expanded in vitro, and further tested for antibody specificity. This testing was carried out by using the Immunohistological Technique described above, in which the ability of the antibodies to bind to frozen sections of lung carcinomas, other tumors and normal huamn tissues were tested. Those hybridomas which produced antibody of apparent specificity for human lung cancer were recloned, expanded and injected into pristane primed 3 month old BALB c mice, where they grew as ascites tumors. Antibodies secreted into the ascites were purified on protein A Sepharose Ey Monoclonal antibody L6 was produced from the corresponding hybridoma as described above. This antibody exhibited the properties indicated above in this specification. The cell line, designated L6 was deposited at the A.T.C.C. on December 6, 1984, and received accession number HB 8677. Studies on the reactivity of the L6 antibody were conducted according to standard procedures such as described by Kannagi The L6 antibody reacted specifically with asialo GalNAc GM₂ and asialo GM₂ with the strongest reaction observed with asialo GalNAc GM₁. A weak reactivity was found with gangliotetraosylceramide asialo GM₁ and x₂ glycolipid structure defined in Table I . Globoside, globotriaosylceramide, lactosylceramide, paragloboside lactotetraosylceramide , glycolipids with Le This study was carried out by a method previously described by Hellstrom Therefore, antibody L6 mediated ADCC when tested on target cells expressing the L6 antigen. To test whether antibody L6 can destroy tumor cells in the presence of human complement, ⁵¹Cr labelled target cells 2981 lung carcinoma were incubated for 4 hours with antibody and human complement, following established procedures Hellstrom Antibodies activating human complement are of interest for at least two reasons they may directly kill tumor cells and they may be able to induce an inflammatory response in the tumor area with activated macrophages and other cells which are preferentially cytolytic to neoplastic as compared to normal cells.
