## Description
The present invention relates to an improved glove,particularly adapted for children and sports, which glove is provided, at each of the two sides whereof, in that portion extending from the hand palm to the wrist,with a zip fastener or the like closure means effective to replace the conventional side seams. As it is known the gloves for children and sports must have good fitting characteristics,in order to permit the user to quickly and easily put on the gloves themselves. On the other hand, conventional gloves are rather difficult to be put on the user hands,benause they are usually wadded and of poor flexibility, or because the user wrist is fitted with cumbersome bands or the like. Accordingly, the task of the present invention is that of overcoming the above mentioned drawbacks, by nroviding a glove which may be fitted easily and quickly to the user hand. According to one aspect of the present invention, the above task is achieved by an improved glove for children or sports,characterized in that it is provided, at the two side ends whereof,with zip fasteners 2 and 3 ,which extend parallely to the longitudinal axis of the user hand,said zip fasteners 2,3 being arranged along two opposite ends of each glove,and being effective to.be opened by causing the sliders 4 and 8 to slide in the direction therealong the finger tips 9 are formed. Further characteristics and advantages of the improved glove according to the invention will become more apparent thereinafter from the following detailed description of a preferred embodiment whereof, being illustrated in the figure of the accompanying drawing, where fig.l illustrates a front schematic view of the improved glove according to the invention, with a zip fastener open at one side whereof and with the zip fastener arranged on the opposite side in a partially closed condition. With reference to the accompanying drawing, the glove according to the present invention, indicated at l,is characterized in that it is provided,at two side ends,with zip fasteners 2 and 3,which extend parallely to the longitudinal axis of the user hand. The above mentioned zip fasteners 2 and 3 are moreover applied at two opposite ends of each glove 1 and are effective to be opened by causing the sliders 4 and 8 to slide in the direction therealong are oriented the tips of the fingers 9 of the glove l,which maybe made of leather artificial leather, fabric and or any other suitable material. More specifically, the zip fasteners 2 and 3 of the glove 1 extend from the rear end portion whereof up to two points located in the portion 6 thereat the hand palm will be housed which may be easily introduced into and removed from the glove owing to the provision of the two mentioned zipfastener pairs While the glove according to the present invention has been thereinabove disclosed with reference to a preferred embodiment thereof,it should be apparent that it is susceptible to many modifications and variations all whereof fall within the spirit and scope of the invention. In particular while the subject glove has been disclosed as applied, for example in sports applications, it may also be used in other applications,such as the long woman gloves which,as it is well known are very tight and require tedious operations to be fitted to the hand.
