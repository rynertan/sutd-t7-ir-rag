# A semiconductor laser.

## Abstract
A semiconductor laser comprising a substrate 31 a current blocking layer 32 formed on said substrate 31 a striped channel 320, 321 formed in said current blocking layer 32 on said substrate 31 , said striped channel being narrow 321 in the vicinity of the facets 23,23 and being wide 320 inside of the facets 23,23 an active layer 34 a portion of the active layer 34 , corresponding to narrow portion 321 of said striped channel being a plane to form a window region 22, 22 and another portion of the active layer 34 corresponding to the wide portion 320 of said striped channel being a crescent shape to form a laser operation area 21 with a mesa structure which is sur rounded by burying layers 36 to cut off current leakage from said laser operation are 21 , the width Wb of the mesa portion 30 of said laser operation area 21 being not less than the width Wi‚ÇÅ of a current injection region 310 formed within said striped channel.
