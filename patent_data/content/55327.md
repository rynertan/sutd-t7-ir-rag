## Description
DESCRIPTION AMORPHOUS METAL ALLOYS HAVING ENHANCED AC MAGNETIC PROPERTIES BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention The invention relates to amorphous metal alloy compositions and, in particular, to amorphous alloys containing iron, silicon and boron having enhanced A.C.magnetic properties. Description of the Prior Art Investigations have demonstrated that it is possible to obtain solid amorphous materials from certain metal alloy compositions. An amorphous material substantially lacks any long range atomic order and is characterized by an X ray diffraction profile consisting of broad intensity maxima. Such a profile is qualitatively similar to the diffraction profile of a liquid or ordinary window glass. This is in contrast to a crystalline material which produces a diffraction profile consisting of sharp, narrow intensity maxima. These amorphous materials exist in a metastable state. Upon heating to a sufficiently high temperature, they crystallize with evolution of the heat of crystallization, and the X ray diffraction profile changes from one having amorphous characteristics to one having crystalline characteristics. Novel amorphous metal alloys have been disclosed by H.S. Chen and D.E. Polk in U.S. Pat. No.3,856,513, issued Dec. 24, 1974. These amorphous alloys have the formula Ma Yb Zc where M is at least one metal selected from the group of iron, nickel, cobalt, chromium and vanadium, Y is at least one element selected from the group consisting of phosphorus, boron and carbon, Z is at least one element selected from the group consisting of aluminum, antimony, beryllium, germanium, indium, tin and silicon, a ranges from about 60 to 90 atom percent, b ranges from about 10 to 30 atom percent and c ranges from about 0.1 to 15 atom percent. These amorphous alloys have been found suitable for a wide variety of applications in the form of ribbon, sheet, wire, powder, etc.The Chen and Polk patent also discloses amorphous alloys having the formula TiXj, where T is at least one transition metal,X is at least one element selected from the group consisting of aluminum, antimony, beryllium, boron, germanium, carbon, indium, phosphorus, silicon and tin, i ranges from about 70 to 87 atom percent and j ranges from about 13 to 30 atom percent. These amorphous alloys have been found suitable for wire applications. At the time that the amorphous alloys described above were discovered, they evidenced magnetic properties that were superior to then known polycrystalline alloys. Nevertheless, new applications requiring improved magnetic properties and higher thermal stability have necessitated efforts to develop additional alloy compositions. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a metal alloy which is at least 90 amorphous consisting essentially of a composition having the formula FeaSibBc wherein a , b and c are atomic percentages ranging from about 75 to 78.5, 4 to 10.5 and 11 to 21 respectively, with the proviso that the sum of 11a 1, b and c equals 100. The subject alloys are at least 90 amorphous and preferably at least 97 amorphous, and most preferably 100 amorphous, as determined by X ray diffraction. The alloys are fabricated by a known process which comprises forming a melt of the desired composition and quenching at a rate of at least about 105OC sec. by casting molten alloy onto a rapidly rotating chill wheel. In addition, the invention provides a method of enhancing the magnetic properties of a metal alloy which is at least 90 amorphous consisting essentially of a composition having the formula Fe a Si B wherein a , b and c are atomic percentages ranging from about 75 to 78.5, 4 to 10.5 and 11 to 21, respectively, with the proviso that the sum of a , b and c equals 100, which method comprises the step of annealing the amorphous metal alloy. Further, the invention provides a core for use in an electromagnetic device such core comprising a metal alloy which is at least 90 amorphous consisting essentially of a composition having the formula Fe a Si B wherein a , wb and c are atomic percentages ranging from about 75 to 78.5, 4 to 10.5 and 11 to 21, respectively, with the proviso that the sum of a , b and c equals 100. The alloys of this invention exhibit improvedA.C. magnetic properties at temperatures up to about 1500C. As a result, the alloys are particularly suited for use in power tranformers, aircraft transformers, current transformers, high frequency transformers e.g.transformers having operating frequencies ranging from about 400 Hz to 100 kHz , switch cores, high gain magnetic amplifiers and low frequency inverters. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The composition of the new amorphous Fe Si B alloy, in accordance with the invention, consists of 75 to 78.5 atom percent iron, 4 to 10.5 atom percent silicon and 11 to 21 atom percent boron. Such compositions exhibit enhanced A.C. magnetic properties.The improved magnetic properties are evidenced by high magnetization, low core loss and low volt ampere demand which remain constant and stable at temperatures up to 1250C. A preferred composition within the foregoing ranges consists of 78 atom percent iron, 6 to 10 atom percent silicon, the balanace being boron. The alloys of the present invention are at least about 908 amorphous and preferably at least about 97 amorphous and most preferably 100 amorphous.Magnetic properties are improved in alloys possessing a greater volume percent of amorphous material. The volume percent of amorphous material is conveniently determined by X ray diffraction. The amorphous metal alloys are6 formed by cooling a melt at a rate of about 10 to 10 OC sec. The purity of all materials is that found in normal commercial practice. A variety of techniques are available for fabricating splat quenched foils and rapid quenched continuous ribbons, wire, sheet, etc. Typically, a particular composition is selected, powders or granules of the requisite elements or of materials that decompose to form the elements, such as ferroboron, ferrosilicon, etc. in the desired proportions are melted and homogenized, and the molten alloy is rapidly quenched on a chill surface, such as a rotating cylinder. The most preferred process for fabricating continuous metal strip containing the alloys of the invention is that set forth in U.S.P. 4,142,571 to Narasimhan. The Narasimhan patent, which is incorporated herein by reference thereto, sets forth a method of forming a continuous metal strip by depositing molten metal onto the surface of a moving chill body. The method comprises the steps of a moving the surface of a chill body in a longitudinal direction at a constant predetermined velocity of from about 100 to about 2000 meters per minute past the orifice of a slotted nozzle defined by a pair of generally parallel lips located proximate to the surface such that the gap between the lips and the surface is from about 0.03 to about 1 millimeter, the orifice being arranged generally perpendicular to the direction of movement of the chill body, and b forcing a stream of molten metal through the orifice of the nozzle into con tact withJthe surface of the moving chill body to permit the metal to solidify thereon to form a continuous stripPreferably, the nozzle slot has a width of from about 0.34 to 1 millimeter, the first lip has a width at least equal to the width of the slot and the second lip has a width of from about 1.5 to 3 times the width of the slot amorphous metal strip produced in accordance with theNarasimhan process has a width of at least about 7 millimeters, preferably at least about 1 centimeter and, more preferably yet, a width of at least about 3 centimeters. The strip is at least 0.02 millimeter thick but may be as thick as about 0.14 millimeter, or thicker, depending on the melting point, solidification and crystallization characteristics of the alloy employed. The alloys of the present invention have an improved processability as compared to other iron based metallic glasses, since the subject alloys demonstrate a minimized melting point and maximized undercooling. The magnetic properties of the subject alloys can be enhanced by annealing the alloys. The method of annealing generally comprises heating the alloy to a temperature sufficient to achieve stress relief but less than that required to initiate crystallization, cooling the alloy, and applying a magnetic field to the alloy during the heating and cooling. Generally, a temperature range of about 3400C to 4400C is employed during heating. A rate of cooling range of about O.SoC min. to 750C min. is employed, with a rate of about 1OC min. to 160C min. being preferred. As discussed above, the alloys of the present invention exhibit improved magnetic properties that are stable at temperatures up to about 1500C, rather than a maximum of 1250C as evidenced by prior art alloys. The increased temperature stability of the present alloys allows utilization thereof in high temperature applications, such as cores in transformers for distributing electrical power to residential and commercial consumers. When cores comprising the subject alloys are utilized in electromagnetic devices, such as transformers, they evidence high magnetization, low core loss and low volt ampere demand, thus resulting in more efficient operation of the electromagnetic device. The loss of energy in a magnetic core as the result of eddy currents, which circulate through the core, results in the dissipation of energy in the form of heat. Cores made from the subject alloys require less electrical energy for operation and produce less heat.In applications where cooling apparatus is required to cool the transformer cores, such as transformers in aircraft and large power transformers, an additional savings is realized since less cooling apparatus is required to remove the smaller amount of heat generated by cores made from the subject alloys In addition, the high magnetization and high efficiency of cores made from the subject alloys result in cores of reduced weight for a given capacity rating. The following examples are presented to provide a more complete understanding of the invention.The specific techniques, conditions, materials, proportions and reported data set forth to illustrate the principles and practice of the invention are exemplary and should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention. EXAMPLES Toroidal test samples were prepared by winding approximately 0.030 kg of 0.0254 m wide alloy ribbon of various compositions containing iron, silicon and boron on a steatite core having inside and outside diameters of 0.0397 m and 0.0445 m, respectively. One hundred and fifty turns of high temperature magnetic wire were wound on the toroid to provide a D.C. circumferential field of 795.8 ampere meter for annealing purposes. The samples were annealed in an inert gas atmosphere for 2 hours at a temperature ranging from 3404C to 4400C with the 795.8A m field applied during heating and cooling to determine the optimum field annealing conditions for each composition. The optimum field annealing condition for each composition is that at which the exciting power of the core is lowest. The samples were cooled at a rate of approximately 100C min. The A.C. magnetic properties, i.e., power loss watts kilogram and exciting power RMS Volt amperes kilogram , of the samples were measured at a frequency of 60 Hz and a magnetic intensity of 1.4 Tesla by the sine flux method. Field annealed A.C. magnetic values for a variety of alloy compositions that are within the scope of the present invention are shown in Table I. Table I FIELD ANNEALED A.C.
