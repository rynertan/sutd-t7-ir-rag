# Light sensitive silver halide color photographic material.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a light sensitive silver halide color photographic material having a silver halide emulsion layer containing at least one layer of a negative working silver halide on a support, comprising the negative working silver halide comprises at least 80 mole of silver chloride, and being color sensitized with at least one kind of sensitizing dyes having the local maximum value of spectral sensitivity in the wavelength region from 445nm to 490nm and at least one kind of sensitizing dyes having the local maximum value of spectral sensitivity in the wavelength region from 420nm to less than 445nm. The photographic material according to this invention exhibits excellent color reproducibility and quick process suitability.
