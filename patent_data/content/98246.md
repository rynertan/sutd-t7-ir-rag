## Description
Ehe present invention relates to a steam vapor generator, which is particularly erfective to be used for supplying or operating electric steam vapor irons. As it is well known, in the industrial ironing of cloth articles there are conventionally used electric irons which are effective to subject the cloth articles to be ironed to a moistening action, by means of steam vapor, either overheated or not. Tne mentioned electric irons, in actual practice,are provided with a suitably perforated plate which communicatea, through a shut off valve and a flexible duct,with a small size steam generator or source. The latter is usually provided with a suitable volume vessel, including water heating means effective to transform into steam the contained water, to convey the produced steam to the mentioned flexible duct. Presently the water vessel comprises one or more union members, provided with tight closure plugs, for periodically introducing water into the vessel itself. That vessel sUpplying system,however,is a rather dangerous one since,in general,the water vessel is under pressure. Accordingly, as the union closure plug is remov ea, boiling steam leakages may occur susceptible to scald the operator. Moreover the closure plug is usually at a very high temperature and may by itself scald the operator. ihus,the task of the present invention is to overcome the above mentioned drawbacks by providing a steam generator, particularly for operating electric steam irons, wherein the steam producing water may be introauced without directly contacting the steam generating vessel. This task, as well as other related practical objects, which will become more apparent thereinafter, are achieved by a doam vapor generator, particularly for operating electric steam irons, characterized in that it comprises a vessel defining, by the upper portion of the casing thereof, an outer chamber communicating with said vessel interior through a manually operable spring check valve the boay thereor is tormea with two radially extenaing holes as provided upstream of the valve shut off member seat, said vessel being arranged on a base including heating means and being further provided with safety and adjusting means as well as with a produced steam outlet duct. further characteristics and advantages of the steam generator, particularly for operating electric steam irons,according to the present invention, will become more apparent hereinafter from the following bewailed description or a prererred embodi ment thereof,beig illustrated, by way of an indicative example, in the accompanying drawing, where fig.l is a cross sectional view schematically illustrating the steam generator according to the present invention with reierence to the mentioned figures, the steam generator, partionlarly for operating electric steam irona, according to the invention, comprises a suitable size vessel l,the upper or top portion thereof is so shaped as to define a chaberliaving such a volume which depends on the volume of the vessel itself. At the bottom of the mentioned chamber there is formed a hole, thereat there is locked one end of a valve body 3,provided with radially extending holes 4,as formed upstream of the seat of its shut off member 5. The latter is mounted on a stem 6 which is provided, at an intermediate position thereof with a disk member 7 resiliently biassed by a coil spring 8, the free and thereof, 9. is helicoidally coupled to a plug 10, arranged above the mentioned valve body 3. Said vessel l,in turn, is mounted on a base 11, including an electric heating resistance 12 and provided, at the top thereof, with a safety valve 13. with the inside of that same vessel, at a lower level than the water level,14,the sensing elements 15 of a pressure switch 15 and lb of a thermostat lb respectively, communicate. Moreover, inside said vessel, at the top thereof, that is at a level higher than the water level, there is provided a duct 17, the free end thereof is prererably upwardly directed. This auct exits said vessel and is coupled to the steam conveying duct ld. Thus, the provision of the chamber 2 at the top ol the vessel,permits to introduce the make up water.without the. need of directly acting on the vessel itself. To this and, infact, it will be sufficient to fill with water the mentioned chamber and then press on the plug 10 in such a way as to disengage the shut off member from the seat thereof, thereby water may ilow into the underlying vessel through the mentioned radially extending holes 4 or the valve body. While a preferred embodiment of the steam generator has been thereinabove disclosed, it should be apparent that said embodiment is susceptiole to several motitications ana variations, without departing from the scope of the invention, as it is defined in the accompanying claims.
