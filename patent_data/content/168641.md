# X ray tube.

## Abstract
An X ray tube is disclosed, which comprises an evacuat ed envelope 2 having a cathode assembly 10 and an anode assembly 8 provided at the opposite ends of the evenlope such that they face each other. The cathode as sembly 10 includes a spiral filament 28 for generating an electron beam with a beam axis. One of the terminal ends of the spiral filament 28 is located in the proximity of the center thereof 28 . The anode assembly 8 includes a conical target 26 with a tip corresponding to the beam axis, for radiating X rays in all directions. When a current flows with the filament of the X ray tube, the temperature of the filament 28 is reduced for a central portion thereof to reduce the density of electrons emitted from the central portion, thus preventing overheating of the tip of the conical target 26 .
