# CONVERGENCE CORRECTION METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR DELTA GUN COLOUR CATHODE RAY TUBE DISPLAYS

## Abstract
Convergence correction for a delta gun CRT at all loca tions on the CRT screen is accomplished by separately implementing the general equation for convergence in that coordinate system peculiar to each of the gun s location rela tive to the screen in modifying the equation coefficients in each of its four quadrants I, II, III, IV to effect convergence in that quadrant. The quadrants of each of the gun s coordinate system is the same as the quadrants of the CRT screen, thereby allowing each of the coefficients to be changed or adjusted only when the terms it multiplies is zero. Complete convergence correction for the entire screen may be accomp lished using only nine screen locations. A unique triangular convergence symbol corresponding to the gun locations is placed at each of these nine locations to adjust the equation coefficients, each leg of the convergence symbol being of a colour which optimises the viewability of the convergence of a particular gun.
