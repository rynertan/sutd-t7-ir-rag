## Description
SAND FILTRATION APPARATUS This invention relates to improvements in relating to a sand filtration apparatus, and more particularly it is concerned with an apparatus of the type described in which a liquid is passed through a sand filtration layer in a horizontal direction to obtain a clear liquid by filtration. Sand filtration is one of the techniques of solid liquid separation for separating materials floating or suspended in a liquid by sedimentation or collision in a sand layer. Sand filtration has a long history and includes a slow filtration process used as in water works and a quick filtration process used as when a coagulant is used. This invention is directed to an apparatus suitable for carrying out the quick filtration process into practice. Heretofore, sand filtration apparatus have been in use with water works or for treating industrial water.Owing to the fact that water resources are dwindling and control of waste water has become stringent, there has in recent years been an increasingly large demand for the sand filtration apparatus and the range of their use has increased and now includes tertiary processing, such as sewage disposal in large cities, small scale sewage disposal in urban communities and disposal of excrement, high degree treatment of industrial water, simplified processing of factory water and water for miscellaneous uses and other systems of water supply. In sand filtration, stationary bed type filtration, the filter medium is obturated and its filtering performance is reduced, making it necessary to wash and clean the filter medium at least once a day. while the.filter medium is being cleaned, the filtering operation has to be interrupted. Thus an additional filtration apparatus has to be provided in reserve when it is desired to carry out filtration continuously for 24 hours a day. This makes it necessary to use accessory equipement and a control device for detecting obturation of the kilter medium and carrying out filtration and cleaning cyclically. To eliminate these disadvantages of the prior art, proposals have been made to adopt movable bed type filtration in which filtration is performed by continuously removing obturated portions of the filter medium from the filtration layer and providing a fresh supply of filter medium. The tendency prevailing in the field of sand filtration technology nowadays is such that the movable bed type filtration is replacing the stationary bed type filtration. In some sand filtration apparatus, a liquid to be treated is generally caused to flow downwardly through the sand filtration layer so that a clear liquid will be obtained at the lower end of the filtration layer after being treated by the filtration layer. In other sand filtration apparatus, a liquid to be treated is caused to flow upwardly through the sand filtration layer so that a clear liquid will be obtained at the upper end of the filtration layer. The volume of liquid treated by a sand filtration apparatus is in proportion to the cross sectional area of the sand filtration layer through which it flows. Thus in sand filtration apparatus of the prior art, it has been necessary to increase the area of the instllation if it is desired to increase the volume of the treated liquid. In a sand filtration apparatus, it is required that the sand filtration layer be constructed such that the inlet side thereof is packed with coarse sand particles and the particle size of the sand is gradually reduced in going toward the outlet side. Stated differently, it is necessary that in a portion of the sand filtration layer near the inlet side the percentage of void be increased to allow only large masses of material incorporated in the liquid to be treated be caught by the coarse sand particles without minute floating materials or suspended materials being sedimented or adhering to the sand, and that the percentage of void be reduced in going from the inlet side toward the outlet side so that the void in the sand filtration layer becomes smaller to allow minuscule foreign matter to be sedimented and adhere to the sand, to thereby enable a clear liquid to be obtained.It is essential that the sand filtration layer have the aforesaid distribution of sand particles. If the arrangement of the coarse and minuscule sand particles were reversed or minuscule sand particles were disposed on the inlet side of a sand filtration layer, both large and small size foreign matter would adhere to the sand and obturation of the sand filtration layer would occur in a short period of time, thereby making it necessary to effect reactivation of the sand filtration layer often. Accordingly, an object of this invention is to provide a sand filtration apparatus capable of providing a large filtration area or increasing the volume of water treated irrespective of the area of installation and capable of effecting cleaning of the filter medium of the filtration layer to reactive same while performing filtration of the liquid, so that when the reactivated filter medium is returned to the filtration layer filter medium of large particle size is located on the inlet side of the sand filtration layer and filter medium of small particle size is located on the outlet side thereof. Another object is to provide a sand filtration apparatus capable of making effective use of the total area of the sand filtration layer by avoiding the occurrence of a short circuit flow of the liquid to be treated through a portion of the filtration layer from the inlet side of the sand filtration apparatus to the outlet side thereof. To accomplish the aforesaid objects, there is provided according to the invention a sand filtration apparatus comprising a treated water chamber surrounded by a wall substantially perpendicular to a floor, a sand filtration chamber containing a filter medium located adjacent the treated water chamber, an inlet chamber located adjacent the sand filtration chamber through a wall substantially perpendicular to the floor and enclosing the sand filtration chamber, the inlet chamber having a pipe connected thereto for supplying untreated water thereto and the treated water chamber having a pipe connected thereto for leading treated water to outside therefrom, means for causing the filter medium to move in circulation from a lower portion of the sand filtration chamber to an upper portion thereof, means for separating the adhesion from the filter medium in the upper portion of the sand filtration chamber as the filter medium moves thereinto in circulation, and means for distributing the filter medium in the sand filtration chamber in such a manner that relatively coarse particles of filter medium are disposed on the inlet side of the sand filtration chamber for the untreated water and relatively fine particles of filter medium are disposed on the outlet side of the sand filtration chamber for the untreated water, whereby the untreated water supplied to the inlet chamber can have foreign matter adhere to the filter medium in the sand filtration chamber as it flows therethrough to thereby enable the treated water to be obtained. In working the invention, the wall enclosing the treated water chamber and the wall enclosing the sand filtration chamber are constructed such that they allow water to pass therethrough but the filter medium is prevented from passing therethrough. In the sand filtration apparatus according to the invention, the sand filtration chamber may have a bottom providing a floor surface of an inverted cone shape the wall between the filtration chamber and the inlet chamber and the wall between the filtration chamber and the treated water chamber may be constructed such that they are composed of a plurality of weather boards opening outwardly upwardly and inwardly upwardly respectively and arranged parallel to one another and the walls may be formed of wire netting of stainless material. In working the invention, these walls are preferably in the form of cylindrical walls substnatially concentric with each other. The lowermost one of the weather boards constituting the wall between the sand filtration chamber and the treated water chamber is advantageously formed in the shape of a cone extending toward the floor surface of the inverted cone shape to form a shade to provide a spacing between the cone shaped shade and the floor surface, to obtain uniform circulation of the sand in the filtration chamber. The means for circulating the filter medium from the lower portion of the filtration chamber to the upper portion thereof may be constructed to have if an opening for blowing air from a central lower portion of the filtration chamber into the filtration chamber and ii a pipe located above the opening for leading the filter medium together with the air to the upper portion of the filtration chamber, the pipe having its upper opening located in the upper portion of the filtration chamber. The distribution means of the sand filtration apparatus includes a shade of a cone shape located around the upper opening of the pipe The shade preferably has a gradient which is below the angle of rest of the used filter medium. The shade preferably has a length which is equal to the distance between it and the weather boards constituting the wall between the filtration chamber and the treated water chamber. The angle formed by the weather boards constituting the wall between the filtration chamber and the treated water chamber and the horizontal is preferably in the range between 20 and 45 degrees, and more preferably in the range between 30 and 40 degrees. The untreated water is preferably fed through a lower portion of the inlet chamber, and the inlet pipe is advantageously provided with a partition plate at its disposed in the inlet chamber, to thereby reduce the flow velocity of the untreated water at the open end. The pipe for withdrawing the treated water from the treated water chamber is preferably mounted in a lower portion of the treated water chamber, to thereby eliminate a dead water zone in the trated water chamber. The above and other objects and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

Referring to Fig. 1, one embodiment of the sand filtration apparatus is shown in a sectional view, in which a pedestal 20 supports thereon a cylindrical tank body 22 divided into an untreated water inlet chamber 16, a filtration chamber 15 and a treated water chamber 17 by cylindrical support walls 12 and 13.The support walls 12 and 13 are substantially coaxial with the cylindrical tank body 22. A filter medium, such as sand, is contained in the filtration chamber 15 defined between the support walls 12 and 13 which are constructed such that they allow water to pass therethrough but do not allow the filter medium to pass therethrough. As shown in Fig. 1, the support walls 12 and 13 are constituted by weather boards located parallel to each other and directed outwardly upwardly and inwardly upwardly respectively. The support wall 13 between the filtration chamber 15 and treated water chamber 17 has a shade 30 of a cone shape mounted at its lower portion.The filtration chamber 15 has a floor which constitutes a tank bottom 21 of an inverted cone shape, and the shade 30 extends toward the tank bottom 21, to define a space between the shade 30 and the tank bottom 21 for the filter medium to move therethrough in circulation. The inlet chamber 16 has an inlet pipe 29 connected to its lower portion and having a partition plate attached to its opening. The treated water chamber 17 has an outlet pipe 25 connected thereto and extending at its opening to a lower portion of the treated water chamber 17. A spray nozzle 26 is mounted in a lower portion of the filtration chamber 15, and an upwardly extending circulation pipe 19 extends above the spray nozzle 26 and has an opening in an upper portion of the filtration chamber 15. A chute 18 of a cone shape is attached to a portion of the circulation pipe 19 slightly below its upper opening and extends to the support wall 13. A regulating pipe 27 and a separating tank 28 for discharging scum are mounted around the upper opening of the circulation pipe 19. Untreated water fed through the inlet pipe 29 is introduced into the inlet chamber 16 and passes through the support wall 12 into the filtration chamber 15. Owing to the pressure of the untreated water, the water flows through the filter medium in the filtration chamber 15 from which it is introduced into the treated water chamber 17 through the support wall 13. When the water flows through the filter medium in the filtration chamber 15, foreign matters in the water are separated from the water and adheres to the filter medium or sand. The clear treated water thus obtained is released from the treated water chamber 17 through the outlet pipe 25. Air is blown through the spray nozzle 26 into the filtration chamber 15. Air currents cause the sand on the floor surface 21 of the inverted cone shape of the filtration chamber 15 to soar in turbulent flow in the circulation pipe 19. The foreign matters adhering to the filter medium are separated therefrom by the air currents of turbulent flow and released together with the sand through the upper opening of the circulation pipe 19. Since the foreign matters are lighter than the filter medium, they collect together on the surface of the water and are discharged from the separating tank 28 through a scum discharging pipe 31. Even if the foreign matters are relatively heavy, they are caused to float on the water directed toward the separating tank 28 to be collected therein.Meanwhile the foreign matters released through the upper opening of the circulation pipe 19 are led downwardly through the regulating pipe 27 and returned to the filtration chamber 15 through the chute 18.At this time, the filter medium is distributed by the chute 18 in such a manner that the sand of large particles size is placed near the inlet side and that of small particle size is arranged near the treated water chamber. By continuously blowing air currents through the spray nozzle 26 for a substantial time, all the filter medium in the filtration chamber 15 can be reactivated while moving through the circulation pipe 19. The weather boards constituting the support wall 13 between the filtration chamber 15 and the treated water chamber 17 preferably form an angle in the range between 20 and 45 degrees with respect to the horizontal. This angle range has the effect of avoiding the filter medium moving between the weather boards into the treated water chamber 17 due to the pressure of water. when the angle is 30 degrees, the sand can be most advantageously held in place within the filtration chamber 15. The angle of the shade 3Q is important in causing the filter medium in the filtration chamber 15 to shift uniformly downwardly. when the angle formed by the shade 30 with respect to the vertical is in the range between 20 and 45 degrees, the filter medium can be moved substantially uniformly in the downward direction. The range between 30 and 40 degrees is more preferable. In the sand filtration apparatus according to the invention, the filter medium reactivated by removing the foreign matters therefrom is returned to the pile of filter medium in the filtration chamber 15 through an upper central portion of the chamber, so that corse filter medium is distributed to a position near the inlet chamber 16 and fine filter medium to a position near the treated water chamber 17. That is, in Fig. 1, the coarse filter medium is distributed immediately inwardly of the support wall 12 and the fine filter medium immediately outwardly of the support wall 13 with the filter medium located in between having the grain size successively reduced in going from the inlet chamber side toward the treated water side in the filtration chamber 15. Fig. 2 shows the distribution of the filter medium in the filtration chamber 15. Sampling of the sand layers on the inlet side, central portion and outlet side was carried out, and the filter medium was divided according to its grain size into groups of below 0.8 mm, between 0.8 and 1 mm, between 1 and 1.19 mm and above 1.19 mm. As shown in Fig. 2, the filter medium of over 1.19 mm accounted for 608 of all the filter medium on the inlet side and no fine filter medium of less than 0.8 mm was found. On the outlet side, the number of filter medium of over 1.19 mm was gradually reducing while that of filter medium of below 0.8 mm or between 0.8 and 1 mm was gradually increasing. The distribution of the filter medium in the filtration chamber 15 that sand particles of large size are located in an outer peripheral portion and sand particles of small size are located in an inner peripheral portion makes the sand filtration apparatus according to the invention quite useful. In an filtration apparatus of the cylindrical shape, water will flow inwardly from the outer periphery of the filtration layer, so that the velocity at which the water is filtered or filtering velocity will naturally become higher in going toward the inner portion of the filtration layer.Thus the relation will be established that the filtering velocity is low in a portion of the filtration layer of a high percentage of void consisting of coarse sand particles and high in a portion of the filtration layer of a low percentage of void consisting of fine sand particles, so that the solid particles will be caught by the filter medium with a high degree of efficiency through the entire filtration layer. The aforesaid distribution of the sand particles offers the additional advantage that it takes time before material floating or suspended in the water causes obturation of the filtration layer. Thus no problem will be raised with regard to obturation of the filtration layer because the filter medium is always reactivated by the circulating flow of sand described hereinabove. The aforesaid distribution of the filter medium offers the additional advantage that the filtering loss head is reduced. The term filtering loss head is defined as referring to the difference in pressure between the water introduced into the filtration apparatus and the water released therefrom which represents the pressure lost by the water while flowing through the filtration apparatus in terms of mm Aq. Fig. 3 shows the results of tests conducted on the filtering loss head mm by passing water through filtration layers of a height varying from 100 to 500 mm at a filtration velocity of 200 m day the rate of entry of water into the filtration chamber in the sand filtration apparatus according to the invention. The results show that the filtering loss head merely had a change of 15 mm when the height of the filtration layer was varied from 100 to 500 mm, showing no large change in the filtering loss head. Fig. 4 shows the results of tests conducted on the filtering loss head by passing water through a filtration layer of a length of 600 mm at a filtration velocity of 100 300 mm inflow velocity in the sand filtration apparatus according to the invention and a downwardly directed flow type filtration apparatus of the prior art. It will be seen in the graph shown inFig. 4 that the filtering loss head is smaller by about 30 in the sand filtration apparatus according to the invention than in the filtration apparatus of the prior art. When a sand filtration apparatus has a horizontally directed liquid channel extending through a filtration layer of substantial vertical height, as is the case with the sand filtration apparatus according to the invention, the flow velocity of the liquid flowing from the untreated liquid side toward the treated liquid side might show variations depending on the position of the liquid. Fig. 5 a shows as a model the left half portion of the apparatus in cross section in which water flows from the inlet chamber 16 to the treated water chamber 17 through the filtration chamber 15. Fig. 5fb shows the flow velocities of the water flowing from left to right. It will be seen that the flow velocities are higher in going toward the top of the stream and lower in going toward the bottom thereof.If the stream of water flowing through the filtration layer had non uniform flow velocities, the upper portion of the filtration layer might be scraped away by the water of high flow velocity to provide a short circuit path. To avoid this phenomenon, the inlet chamber 16 and the treated water chamber 17 are each preferably provided with a partition wall.By feeding untreated water to the inlet chamber 16 at its lower portion in the sand filtration apparatus having the partition plates described hereinabove, the untreated water can be made to flow at a substantially uniform flow velocity through the filtration layer in its upper, middle and lower portions, and withdrawing of the treated water is advantageously effected from the treated water chamber 17 at its lower portion. It is necessary to avoid introduction of the filter medium into the treated water chamber 17 by moving between the weather boards constituting the support wall 13 between the filtration chamber 15 and the treated water chamber 17. If the angle formed by the weather boards with respect to the horizontal were small, the sand would be made to ascend the inclined surfaces of the weather boards and move into the treated water chamber 17 by the flow of the water. If this angle were too large, the flow of the water would be interrupted and the flow velocity would rise at the opening, resulting in the sand moving over the weather boards. Fig. 6 shows the results of tests conducted on the angle formed by the weather boards with respect to the horizontal in relation to the flow velocity of water with a view to determining the angle at which the sand might move over the weather boards.The graph shown in Fig. 6 shows that if the flow velocity of the water is located above the curve, the sand will move over the weather boards and that the sand will not move over the weather boards when the flow velocity is below the curve. It will be seen in the graph shown in Fig. 6 that when the angle formed by the weather boards with respect to the horizontal is in the range between 20 and 45 degrees, the sand is prevented from being introduced into the treated water chamber 17 even if the flow velocity of the water is 800 m day on the inlet chamber side , and that the angle at which the movement of the sand is avoided until the flow velocity is maximized is about 30 degrees. When the support wall 13 is constituted by wire netting, the wire netting used is preferably formed of stainless steel and the netting is preferably of 20 40 mesh. By using this type of wire netting, it is possible to avoid the movement of the sand therethrough even when the flow velocity of water is over 800 m day. Investigation into the movement of the sand within the filtration chamber 15 has been conducted. The filter medium in the filtration chamber preferably behaves such that it has the same uniform fluidity on the untreated water inlet side and the treated water outlet side. Figs. 7 a , 7 b 7 c and 7 d show the results of tests conducted on the movement of the filter medium obtained when the angle e formed by the shade 30 at the lower end portion of the support wall 13 between the filtration chamber 15 and the treated water chamber 17 with respect to the vertical was varied to 0, 40, 50 and 60 degrees respectively. When the angle e was 0 degree as shown inFig. 7 a , the sand on the treated water outlet side had a high fludity and the sand on the untreated water inlet side showed almost no fluidity. This phenomenon would be accounted for by the fact that the treated water side provides a passage for the sand to move toward an air lift pump and the cleaned sand is small in amount. When the angle e was 50 60 degrees as shown in Figs. 7 c and 7 d , the sand on the untreated water inlet side had a high fluidity because the passage for the sand to move is nearer to the untreated water inlet side than the central portion of the sand layer, and the sand on the treated water outlet side showed almost no tendency to move because the force urging it to move was low, possibly due to the fact that the angle of inclination of the shade 30 is in the range between 30 and 40 degrees with respect to the horizontal which is substantially equal to the angle of rest 30 degrees of sand in the water. When the angle e was 40 degrees as shown inFig 7 b , the sand on the untreated water inlet side had a high speed of movement and the sand on the treated water outlet side was not inordinately slow in movement, indicating that the sand in the filtration chamber was as a whole balanced in its fluidity.Such balanced fluidity of the sand was obtained when the angle e was in the range between 20 and 45 degrees.Example The sand filtration apparatus according to the invention was provided and tests were run for about a month to see how it operates. The particulars of the apparatus are as follows diameter of the tank body, 2.2 m height of the tank body 22 from the tank bottom 21, 4.7 m angle of inclination of the support wall, 30 degrees angle of inclination of the shade 30, 40 degrees flow velocity of water through the filtration layer inflow velocity , 200 m day flow rate of untreated water, 60 m3 hour flow rate of cleaning air, 6 m3 hour and flow rate of discharged cleaning water, 6 m3 hour. The tests consisted in treating secondary processed water of the sewage and the results are shown in Figs. 8 a , 8 b and 8 c indicating SS concentration, BOD and COD respectively. In the graphs shown in Figs. 8 a 8 c , t x and A represent untreated water, treated water and discharged cleaning water respectively. It will be seen that the values of SS, BOD and COD of the treated water dropped even if the SS, BOD and COD of the untreated water showed variations in values. The description set forth hereinabove refers to the sand filtration apparatus according to the invention as being cylindrical in form. However, the apparatus may be angled as shown in Fig. 9. In this case inlet chambers 16B and 16B are located on the left and right sides, filtration chambers 15B and 15B are located inwardly of the inlet chambers 16B and 16B , and treated water chambers 17B and 17B are located inwardly of the filtration chambers 15B and 15B . A spray nozzle 26B and a circulation pipe 19B are located in a central portion.
