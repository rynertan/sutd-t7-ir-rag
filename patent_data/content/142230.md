## Description
Title CONVERSION OF SUCROSE TO FRUCTOSE AND ETHANOL BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention This invention relates to a method for converting sucrose to fructose and ethanol.2. Prior Art The sugar industry has become concerned following recent announcements by many major food and drink manufacturing companies that they intend replacing sugar with fructose obtained from corn syrup as a sweetener.Fructose is nearly twice as sweet as sugar and so only half the amount is required for the same level of sweetness. In addition, the calorific value of fructose is lower than that of sucrose which is important in this health conscious world. The conversion of corn syrup to fructose is energy dependent as the corn syrup must first be converted to glucose. With the process presently in use, the yield of fructose is low and the production of slime in the fermenter is a problem. The production of ethanol from sugar cane is well known and in Brazil, the ethanol is mixed with petrol to produce gasohol . This process is only economic in countries which have large areas available for the cultivation of sugar cane and where local oil reserves are low, requiring the importation of oil, with the resultant drain on foreign reserves. SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide a method for producing fructose and ethanol from sucrose on an economic basis. It is a preferred object to provide such a method where the energy input is low. It is a further preferred object to provide a method where the purity of the sucrose is not vital to the success of the method. It is a still further preferred object to provide a method where the ethanol produced can be used as a energy source to maintain the method in train, and where the production of slime in the fermenter is eliminated, or at least minimized Other preferred objects of the present invention will become apparent from the following description. In one aspect the present invention resides in a method for the production of fructose and ethanol from sucrose, including the step of fermenting sucrose, as the fermentation substrate, using the microorganism Zymononas mobilis and or the enzyme immobolised lavansucrase as the fermentation agent in the presence of a fermentation medium wherein the concentration of the sucrose is greater than 30 . The concentration is calculated by weight, where 1 equals 10 grams litre . One preferred strain of the microorganism Zymononas mobilis has been deposited in the culture collection of the University of Queensland, MicrobiologyDept., St. Lucia, Queensland, Australia, under DepositNo. UGM2716 and deposited in the American Type CultureCollection ATCC , 12301 Parklawn Drive, Rockville,Maryland 20852, U.S.A. on the 2loth April, 1984 underDeposit No. 39676. This strain has been developed from the 1,Zymononas mobilis strain ATCC Deposit No. 29191 which is a second preferred strain suitable for use with the present invention. The enzyme immobilised lavansucrase is identified by Deposit No. EC2.4.1.10 of the Enzyme NomenclatureCommittee of the International Union of Biochemists. Preferably the sucrose is obtained from sugar cane or sugar beet and may be supplied to the fermenter in the form of refined sugar, crushed sugar cane juice, molasses or the like. Preferably the sucrose concentration is the range of 35 50 , with a concentration of approximately 40 being most preferred for maximum fructose and ethanol yield. Preferably the fermentation medium includes any one or more of the following components peptone, yeast extract, potassium dihydrogen phosphate KH2PO14 , ammonium sulphate NH4 2S04 , urea, and magnesium sulphate MgS047H20 . Preferably the components are provided in the concentration range of 0.01 to 0,5 each, with approximately 0.2 being preferred. Preferably the microorganism Zymononas mobilis and or the enzyme lavansucrase are present in the concentration of approximately 0.2 being preferred. Preferably the pH of the fermentation process is maintained within the range of 14.0 to 7.0, with a pH of approximately 6.0 being preferred. Preferably the temperature in the fermenter is maintained in the range of 35 400C, This temperature range appears to produce the best fructose yield and eliminates, or markedly reduces, the production of slime in the fermenter. Preferably, when the fermentation has been completed, the microorganism and or immobilised levansucrase is separated from the fermentation products e.g. by centrifuging , the ethanol is distilled off and the fructose is concentrated to produce fructose syrup and or crystallized fructose. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS To enable the invention to be fully understood, preferred examples of the method will now be described.EXAMPLE I Crushed sugar cane juice is pumped direct from the sugar mill crushes to the fermenter to provide a sucrose concentration of 142 . If required, the fermentation medium containing any one or more of peptone, yeast extract, potassium dihydrogen sulphate, ammonium sulphate and magnesium sulphate is prepared, with each component having a concentration of 0.21 and added to the fermenter with the microorganism Zymononas mobilis ATCC. 39676 at a concentration of 0.22 . The pH of the fermenter is adjusted to 5.8 and the temperature raised to 370C. The fermentation process is carried out fairly quickly and is completed in approximately 24 50 hours.The fermentation liquor is centrifuged or filtered to remove the microorganism before undergoing distillation to recover the ethanol. The fructose produced is then concentrated to form a fructose syrup.EXAMPLE II Crushed sugar beet juice is placed in the fermenter at a sucrose concentration of 36 . The fermentation medium of Example I, at a concentration of 0.15 , is added to the fermenter with the enzyme immobilized lavansucrase at a concentration of 0.15 . The pH of the fermenter is adjusted to 6.1 and the temperature raised to 390C. The fermentation process is carried out for 24 30 hours until the enzyme has converted the sucrose to fructose and glucose. The microorganism Zymononas mobilis ATCC. 39676 is then added to the fermenter in the concentration of 0.25 and this converts the glucose to ethanol. The fermentation liquor is centrifuged or filtered to remove the microorganism and enzyme and the ethanol is then distilled off. The fructose produced is then concentrated to form a fructose syrup and may then be crystallized. It has been calculated from experiments carried out that 1 tonne of sucrose will produce approximately 0.5 tonne of fructose, 0.25 tonne of ethanol and 0.25 tonne of carbon dioxide CO2 . The ethanol produced has commercial value as a component for gasahol or as a base product in the chemical industry e.g. for the production of ethylene, while the other by product, carbon dioxide, may be used for dry ice or as a carbon source for the growth of algae biomass. The fermentation process requires only a low energy input as the microorganism produces a fair amount of heat during the fermentation process. In addition, the fermentation is carried out in semi anaerobic conditions, avoiding the need for aerating pumps, the fermentation components and products only requiring little mechanical stirring. Experiments have shown that the success of the fermentation process is not wholly dependent on the quality of the sucrose as the substitute. Successful tests have been carried out even on rotting cane which indicates that the process is particularly suited for industrial application and the fermenter can be provided adjacent a sugar mill to reduce transport costs. As the sucrose does not have to be sterilized, the energy input can be kept low. As little, if any slime is produced in the fermenter, cleaning costs for the fermenter are negligible, assisting the economics of the process. The economics are further improved as the microorganism does not take up the fructose produced by the process. World production quotas apply on the production of sucrose but not on fructose and so the process provides an additional market for sugar cane. It would be readily apparent to the skilled addressee that various changes and modifications may be made to theExamples described without departing from the present invention.
