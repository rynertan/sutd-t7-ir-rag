# Synthetic beta lactam compounds, a process for their preparation and compositions containing them.

## Abstract
This invention provides synthetic β lactam antibacterial compounds, a process for their preparation and pharmaceutical compositions containing them. The compounds are those of the formula II R₁ is a group such that CO₂R₁ is a carboxylic acid group or a salt or ester thereof and R₂ is a phenyl group or a phenyl group substituted by one to four groups selected from lower alkyl, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, CN, NO₂, COR₃, OR₃,SR₃, NH₂, NHCOR₃, NHCO₂R₃, CO₂R₃ or CO₂R₁₀ where R₃ is lower alkyl, benzyl, fluorobenzyl, chlorobenzyl, bromobenzyl or nitrobenzyl and CO₂R₁₀ is carboxyl or a salt thereof, not more than three such groups being selected from fluorine, chlorine, bromine, CN, NO₂, NH₂,COR₃ or CO₂R₃ and not more than two such groups being selected from CN, NO₂ or NH₂.
