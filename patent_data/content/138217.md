# Apparatus for adjusting the inclination of the automobile headlamp.

## Abstract
An apparatus for adjusting the inclination of automobile headlamp. This apparatus is for adjusting the inclination of au tomobile headlamp having a linearly movable member mechan ically coupled to the headlamp assembly and a reduction gear group mechanically coupled to the member and driven by a motor which comprises a power source having a negative terminal and a positive terminal, a DC electric motor having a first winding and a second winding wound on a stator or a rotor, the ends of the first and second windings being respectively connected to input termi nals and output terminals formed on motor body, the output terminals being connected to the negative terminal of the power source and constructed to rotate the rotor in opposite directions when either input terminal of the first and second windings is electrically connected of the positive terminal of the power source, angular position switch member having a pair of conduc tor units respectively connected to the input terminals and spaced from each other and a plurality of contacts relatively movable and relative at 1 1 to a plurality of predetermined an gular positions of the light bulb said relative movement being carried out in response to the variation in the angular position of the light bulb, insulating portions formed corresponding to the angular positions of the light bulb on a trace formed by the plurality of contacts during the relative movement between a pair of conductor units, the other contact making contact with either one of the conductor units when one of the contacts makes contact with the corresponding insulating portion, and operation switch members each having stationary con tact group having a plurality of switch positions connected to the plurality of contacts of said angular position switch mem ber and movable contacts contacted selectively with one of the stationary contacts and connected to the positive terminal of the power source, said operation switch member being switched from one switch position to other switch position, thereby electrically connecting the stationary contact correspondng to the other switch position to either of the conductor units of the angular position switch member, with the result that either of the first and second winding of the motor is energized to rotate the mo tor in the corresponding direction, thereby stopping the motor when the contact corresponding to the other switch position of the pluralityof contacts of the angular position switch mem ber makes contact with the corresponding insulating portion.
