# Process for forming a protective coating on an information storage device.

## Abstract
In a process for forming an optically transparent po lymeric protective layer on the surface of an information storage device such as for an information disc, the device disc is placed with the surface in a stationary horizontal po sition and a liquid radiation curable coating composition is applied to the surface from an applicator disposed above it. Coating of the disc is accomplished by equally spaced se quential movement of the applicator on a plane parallel to the surface and the applied liquid coating is then allowed to spread evenly across the surface and is thereafter cured by radiation.
