# HIGH EFFICIENCY BOILER

## Abstract
The thermal efficiency of a boiler is increased by actively causing condensation of water vapour in the flame gas and transferring the latent heat of condensation to water being fed to the boiler. A heat pump system incorporating an evaporator 32 and a condensor 30 is used to provide a controllable heat sink which causes the active condensation. The condensor 30 is preferably included in a heat exchanger 20 so that the water being fed to the boiler is heat by both the flame gases from the boiler and by the condensor.
