# Data transmission system.

## Abstract
A binary serial data transmission system utilizes four voltage levels A to D, with a 0 being coded as a single step transition towards or between the two intermediate levels B and C, and a 1 being coded as a double step transition between levels A and C or levels B and D. The encoder may comprise four flip flops corresponding to the four levels, with logic circuitry to set just the appropriate one, and gating four voltage sources. The decoder may differentiate the signal to yield spikes of two magnitudes and either polarity, four comparators one for each combination of spike voltage and polarity, logic circuitry which sets a flip flop on outputs from two comparators and resets it on an output from only one, and clock circuitry which produces a clock pulse on any spike.
