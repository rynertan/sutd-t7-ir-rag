# Process for preparing organo nitrogen grafted copolymers, the copolymers so produced and mineral oil compositions containing them.

## Abstract
Nitrogen containing copolymers are prepared by the reaction of lithiated hydrogenated conjugated dienemonovinylarene copolymers with nitrogen containing organic compounds. The nitrogen containing copolymers are oil additives which combine the aspects of viscosity index improvers with dispersant properties.
