# Cylinder lock resistant to picking.

## Abstract
The cylinder lock comprises a body 10 , a cylinder 20 , a bush 30 , and a key 40 to unlock this lock, characterised in that the keyway has a spiral entrance 31 which allows only the entry of a specialised key 40 , and in that the ward mechanisms are arranged around the periphery of the cylinder 20 , contrasting with those of a conventional cylinder lock which are arranged on a plane, to protect the lock against being picked by unauthorised persons with a wire or skeleton key, and to prolong the life of the use of such lock.

## Description
UNPICKABLE CYLINDER LOCKThe present invention concerns a cylinder lock which an adroit picker finds it difficult to pick with a wire or a skeleton key, and which has resilient means far more durable than conventional cylinder locks.Basically, conventional cylinder keys comprise substantially a planar key with an indented edge, a cylinder, and a body internally provided with a plurality of pin tumblers resiliently retained in a tunnel orienting to the keyway. When a key with a contoured profile on one edge is inserted into the keyway from the keyhole, the pins will be contacted by these undulation, and once the correct key is inserted thereinto, then the pin tumblers will all be arranged in such a position as to allow the cylinder to be turned. Straight in structure, the keyway of such conventional lock are liable to be picked by probing a wire therein. Moreover, the resilient means, generally springs, which urge the pin tumblers against the notches of a key at a specific level to discriminate if the key is the correct one, are hair spring thin.After some use accumulation of rust our dirt may lead to failure of such fine parts, thus reducing the life of the lock.Still further, traditional locks are complicated in their construction which means that these are difficult to assemble and to manufacture and which also means that the cost of production is high. It is the main object of this invention to provide a cylinder lock which obviates the above defects in that the lock is more secure against unauthorised unlocking without the use of the correct key and also that the use of spring loaded wards is obviated. Thus the life of the lock is increased.To prevent the lock from being picked by probing a wire or a skeleton thereinto by unauthorised persons, the keyhole of this invention is designed a spiral entrance that allows only the entry of specialised keys1 the front end of which is provided with a plurality of projections arranged around the periphery thereof, corresponding to equal number of slots provided at one end of the cylinder, in each of which slots there rests a ward piece resiliently urged thereinto to prevent the rotation of the cylinder, which ward piece is pushed outwardly away from the slot and no longer hindersthe rotation of the cylinder when a corresponding projection enters the slot. Only when all the projections of the key exactly coincide with the slots of cylinder can the key be pushed to such an operating position that its projections may urge agaisst the ward pieces.If the projections outnumber the slots, the key is not allowed to reach this position. On the other hand, if the slots outnumber the projections, even if the key is permitted to reach the operating position, there still exists art least one ward piece that hampers the rotation of the cylinder.Another feature of this invention is that the resilient means can be economically a thick metal reeds instead of the springs fabricated by extremely fine wire, thus enhancing the durability and reducing the cost of the manufacture thereof.Other and important objects of this invention will be apparent from the following description, claims and accompanying drawing.Figure 1 is an exploded perspective view of a cylinder lock constructed in accordance with the invention Figure 2 is a longitudinal cross sectional view of the assembled lock of Figure 1 with the key in positionReferring now to the drawings, the cylinder lock according to the invention includes a body, a cylinder, a bush and a key, generally designated by reference numerals 10 , 20 , 30 , and 40 respectively.In the preferred embodiment of Figure 1, the body has a bore 11 which receives cylinder 20 and bush 30 , the former being rotatable therein, whereas the latter being immovably secured in place, for example by passing a pin 15 through hole 151 .Hook 12 has a recess 121 , the dimension and the position of which allow one part of ball 13 retained within a hole 14 to enter when the hook is in locked position in blind hole 16 so that it cannot be pull up. Like structure may be formed at the other leg of hook 12 . See Figure 2 .At one end of cylinder 20 there are provided with two opposite recesses 26 , each of which is formed by a cutout defined by two intersecting faces 261 262 .When the cylinder is turned to a position such that face 261 directly opposite to ball 13 , i.e. normal to the long axis of hole 14 , the clearance between the inner wall of body 10 and the upper end of cylinder is broadest and enough to allow the ball to totally leave recess 121 to free hook 12 so that the latter can be unlocked see Figure 2 . Similarly, when cylinder 20 is turned in reverse direction, the nonrecessed portion 27 urges ball 13 back into recess 121 to lock hook 12 .To allow only selective entry of specific keys, the outer end of bush 30 is provided with a spiral entrance 31 which is structured so that only an object with spiral structure of which the pitch and lead angle substantially coincides with that of the entrance is allowed to be screwed thereinto. Further, to discrim inate whether or not the key thus enters is the correct one, the lower end 21 of cylinder 20 , which is nested in the upper end of bush 30 , forms a plurality of slots 22 spaced apart from each other around the periphery of end 21 and extending along the length of cylinder 20 .Complementary to these slots, the end of key 40 , in a preferred embodiment, forms an enlarged end 42 provided with a plurality of projectors 41 arranged around the periphery thereof, the dimension and position of which projections substantially coincide with the slots 22 , and at the site at the upper end of bush corresponding to each slot 22 there is a hole 32 , through which a ward piece 33 is resiliently urged inwardly to reach one of said slots 22 . The projections are preferably ridges extending along the length of said key. Preferably ward piece 33 is inseparably fixed to one end of a spring reed 34 ,the other end of the latter being secured to the outer wall of bush 30 by, for example, welding or by a screw not shown .To allow key 40 to be screwed into the lock through the spiral entrance 31 , there is provided a spiral groove 43 extending across the projections 41 , which spiral grove 43 is biten into by the helical edge 311 of spiral entrance 31 , thereby allowing the key to be screwed into the bush to reach cylinder. When the whole length of spiral groove passes through the spiral entrance, the key can be directly pushed axially so that the projections fit into their corresponding slots. With the projections, the enlarged end 42 of the key looks like a gear. However, unlike the gears, the width of each projection and the distance between any two adjacent projections may differ greatly at random, depending on the design of the slots 22 . As all of the pitch and the lead angle of the spiral entrance, and. the position and number of the slots may vary arbitrarily, the probability that a lock happened to be unlocked by the key of another such lock is extremely low, thus ensuring high security and reliablility of this invention. An alternative modification of the key 40 , designated by 40 , is also feasible. It has a spiral shank 43 , with a length of its front forming a plurality of projections at the outer side. To adapt to such modification, the slots 22 of cylinder 20 and the ward pieces 33 and holes 32 of bush 30 must be arranged in a spiral trajectory instead of a circumference. This is easy to understand, and therefore not illustrated in the drawing. However, the spiral shank must be structured so that it, before reaching the slots, can be pushed inwardly a short distance in axial direction to fit its projection into mating slots.
