# FLOW CONTROLLER

## Abstract
A flow controller for controlling an auxiliary air supply to an internal combustion engine to produce pulsations leading to better fuel atomisation and cleaner running. An elongate chamber 14 contains three hard balls 56, 58, 60, the central one 58 being lightest and having narrowest flow passage past it. Resulting turbulence causes oscillation of the balls. The ball 56 at the inlet side intermittently closes off the inlet. The ball at the outlet side is urged to deform an O ring 54 to restrict the outlet, thus reducing the dependence of the flow rate on the engine suction.
