# WELL LOGGING DEVICE

## Abstract
An ultrasonic apparatus and method for inspection of downhole pipe casings is disclosed. A plurality of transduc ers mounted on a movable probe are sequentially operated to transmit pulses at selected points along the surface of the downhole pipe to determine pipe deformation and or wall thickness. An additional transducer is provided to determine transmissibility of the pulses and thereby correct for changes in the transmission properties of the medium through which the pulses travel as the probe advances along the pipe casing.
