# System for controlling a robot in association with a rotary table.

## Abstract
A system for controlling a robot operating in association with a rotary table, including a robot, a rotary table, and a control circuit. The control circuit carries out a step of com posing and storing teaching data as values on a rotary table co ordinate system, the rotational shaft of the rotary table being the vertical axis, a step of calculating each of the interpolation points by carrying out path interpolation of the stored teaching data on the rotary table coordinate system, and a step of calcu lating the rotational angle of the rotary table which is required to be rotated. The control circuit also carries out a step of computing the coordinates rotated by said rotational angle around the axis of rotation of the rotary table, a step of trans forming the data obtained by the computing step from the rotary table coordinates to the robot coordinates, and a step of operating the robot by the output of the transformation step.
