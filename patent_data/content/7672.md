Trichophyton,Candida albicans and some plant moulds. Additionally the compounds according to the invention are valuable intermediates for the preparation, in high yields, of imidazoles that may be substituted on the 1st and or 5th ring carbon atom. These imidazoles are prepared by reacting the 1 isocyano 1 sulphonylethenyl derivatives with a primary amine or with ammonia, under removal of the SO 2Rz group. The imidazoles may be useful, inter alia, for stabilisation of meat colour, as a catalyst in epoxy resin reactions as accelerators in photographic developers, and as stabiliser in enzyme preparations for cleaning purposes. The compounds according to the invention may be prepared by treating a compound, having the general formula EMI10.1 wherein Rx, Ry and Rz are as indicated above, with a dehydrating agent. Any method for the preparation of an isocyanide from a formamide may be used, for example the reaction with phosphorusoxychloride. That reaction is preferably carried out at lower temperatures, e.g. between 50 and 25eC, preferably between 30 and 5ec. Other dehydrating agents may, however, also be used.Examples thereof are phosgene, thionyl chloride, cyanuryl chloride, alkyl and arylsulphonyl chloride, a mixture of triphenylphosphine, carbon tetrachloride and triethyl amine, 2 chloro 3 ethylbenzoxazolium tetrafluoroborate or phosphorus tri or pentachloride clef. Ugi, Isonitril Chemistry, 1977, Acad. Press New York, pages 10 to 16 for a more complete review and diphosgene c.f. Skorna and Ugi,Angew. Chemie 89 1977 page 267 . The dehydration is preferably carried out in the presence of an acid binding agent, such as an amine. Examples of suitable amines are triethyl amine, substituted or unsubstituted pyridines, N methylmorpholine, while other alkaline agents maybe used too, such as potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, potassium t butylate and in special cases even sodium hydroxide.The dehydration is preferably carried out in an inert organic solvent, such as di , tri or tetrachloromethane, ethyl acetate, dioxan, benzene, toluene, xylene, o dichlorobenzene, acetone, 1 ,2 dimethoxyethane, bis 2 methoxyethyl ether, dimethyl formamide or 1,2 dichloroethane or mixtures thereof. Generally the compounds of formula I are formed, but sometimes mixtures of compounds of formula I and those of formula II are formed, or even compounds of formula II alone. It depends more or less on the pKa of the amine, which of the compounds are formed in favour. The compounds of formula II may be obtained by treating the corresponding sulphomethylisocyanide with the corresponding aldehyde or ketone and a stroS alkaline agent as indicated by SchÃ¶llkopf et al, Angew. Chemie, Int. Ed. Engi. 12 No. 5 1973 pages 407 to 408. Examples of useful strong alkaline agents are alkali metal t butylate, alkali metal ethanolate, alkali metal hydride, butylated alkali metals, in which the alkali metal is generally lithium, sodium or potassium Potassium t butylate is preferably used.The reaction with the alkaline compound may be carried out at room temperature, but it is preferably carried out at lower temperatures, e.g. between 80 and 450 preferably between 60 and 300C, dependent on the solvent used. The reaction is preferably carried out in an inert gas atmosphere, e.g. a nitrogen gas atmosphere. Higher yields are generally obtained in this way. The reaction is further preferably carried out in a polar organic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide, 1,2 dimethoxyethane, dimethylsulphoxide, hexamethylphosphorustriamide, dioxane, toluene or mixtures thereof. It is an advantage of the invention that the preparation of the compounds of formula III and those of formula I or 11 may be combined to a one pot reaction in many cases. Therefore it is also a feature of the invention to provide a process for the preparation of compounds of formula I or II in which a compound having the formula Rz S02 CH2 N C IV wherein Rz is as indicated above, is treated with a strong alkaline agent and a compound having the formula Rx CO Ry, wherein Rx and Ry are as indicated above, at lower temperatures and in an inert gas atmosphere, characterized in that the compound is treated with a dehydrating agent in a one pot process . It is appreciated to remark that a number of the inter mediates of formula ifs are new and thus form a feature of the invention In general the following compounds, which also form a feature of the invention, are new formamides having the general formula EMI12.1 wherein Rx and Ry are the same or different and each is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having t to 10 carbon atoms or an aryl group, substituted or not substituted by one or more nitro, halogen, lower alkyl, cycloalkyl,lower alkoxy or aryl groups, or a five or sixmembered heterocyclic group bearing one or more oxygen, sulphur or nitrogen atoms as hetero atoms, substituted or not substituted by one or more lower alkyl, aryl or halogen groups, with the provision that, if Ry is a hydrogen atom, Rx is not a phenyl or t butyl group, or Rx and Ry, together with the carbon atom to which they are attached, represent a five to eight membered cycloalkylidene group which may bear one or more oxygen, sulphur or nitrogen atoms as hetero atoms, with the exception of a cyclohexylidene group, or represent an adamantylidene or cholestanylidene group, substituted or not substituted by one or more lower alkyl groups, and Rz is an aryl group substituted or not substituted by one or more lower alkyl groups. Formamides that are preferred according to the invention are those wherein Rx is an aryl or five membered heteroaryl group, which may bear an oxygen, sulphur or nitrogen atom as the heterocyclic atom, and may be substituted by a lower alkyl, nitro, lower alkoxy or halogen group, Ry is a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl group, with the provision that, if Ry is a hydrogen atom, Rx is not a phenyl group, and Rz is an aryl group substituted or not substituted with one or more lower alkyl groups. Formamides forming a feature of the invention are adamantYl idene 4 toluenesulPhonzrlmethyl Eormamidet 1 formamido 2 4 nitrophenyl 1 4 toluenesulphonyl ethene, 1 formamido 2,2diphenyl 1 4 toluenesulphonyl ethene, 1 formamido 1 4 toluenesulphonyl ethene, 1 formamido 2 2 furanyl 1 4 toluenesulfonyl ethene, 1 formamido 2 4 chlorphenyl 1 4 toluenesulphonyl ethene, 1 formamido 2 phenyl 1 4 toluenesulfonyl 1 propene, 1formamido 2 2 furanysl 1 4 toluenesulphonyl 1 propene, N tetra hydropyran 4 ylidene 4 toluenesulphonyl methylformamide, 1 forma mido 1 4 toluenesulphonyl 1 nonene, N alpha thian 4 ylidenen 4 toluenesulphonylmethyl formamide, 1 formamido 2 methyl 2 thien2 yl 1 4 toluenesulphonyl 1 propene, N alpha cycloheptylidene 4 toluenesulphonylmethyl formamide, 1 formamido 2 2 thienyl 1 4toluenesulphonyl ethene, N alpha 1 methylpiperid 4 ylidine 4 toluenesulphonylmethyl formamide, 2 penyl 1 formamido 1 4 toluenesulphonyl 1 hexene, N alpha cyclooctylidene 4 toluenesulphonyl methyl fomamide, 1 formamido 2 methyl 1 4 toluenesulphonyl 1undecene, 1 formamido 2 4 nitrophenyl 1 4 tolueneslphonyl 1propene, 1 formamido 2 4 methoxyhenyl 1 4 toluenesulphonyl 1 ethene, 1 formamido 1 4 toluenesulphonyl 1 pentene, N alpha cyclo hexylidenebenzenesulphonylmethyl formamide, 1 formamido Ã¤2 pentyl 1 4 toluenesulphonyl 1 heptene, 2 5 chloror 2 thienyl 1 formamido1 4 toluenesulphonyl 1 propene, 1 formamido 2 4 pyridyl 1 4toluenensulphonyl ethene, N alpha 3 cholestanylidene 4 toluene sulphonylmethyl formamide, 1 formamido 2 methyl 1 4 toluenesulphonyl 4 1,1,3 trimethylcyclohex 2 ene 2 yl 3 trans 1,3 butadiene, 2 1 formamido 1 4 toluenesulphonyl ethyn 2 yl methylpyrrole, 2 4 phenylphenyl 1 formamido 1 4 toluenesulphonyl 1 propene.These compounds are important intermediates for the formation of the compounds having formula I or II , according to the invention. By products may be formed when reacting toluenesulphonylmethylisocyanide with certain aldehydes, Ã²r example with octanal, resulting easily in 4 toluenesulphonyl 5 heptyl 2 oxazoline, or with p iononet resulting easily in 3 acetyl 4 1,1,3 trimethylcyclohex 2 en 2 yl pyrrole. These compounds are also a feature of the invention since they may have useful fungicidal properties. The compounds of formula I or II , according to the invention, in which Rx and Ry do not represent hydrogen atoms, are generally stable, and may generally be stored at room temperature.Those compounds in which Rx or Ry is a hydrogen atom should be stored generally at lower temperatures, e.g. in a refrigerator. The 1 isocyanoll p toluenesulphonylethene Rx and Ry hydrogen atoms appears to be very unstable. Notwithstanding this the compound, in the reaction medium in which it must be present, could be converted with a primary amine into the corresponding imidazole, which in turn, may be converted into its picrate. This proves that 1 isocyano 1 p toluenesulphonylethene exists. Theoretically two isomers of the compounds of formula I or tri , according to the invention, may be formed. In many cases only one isomer is found but in a few cases E and Z isomers have been found. For the preparation of the imidazoles from the compounds having formula I according to the invention an amine or ammonia is used. Two equivalents of the primary amine or ammonia are added to a solution of the compound, and a fast exothermic reaction follows, resulting in the imidazole in question. The reaction is very slow if aromatic amines, such as aniline, are used. The compounds according to the invention may be used for the formulation of pharmaceutic preparations, such as ointments and tablets for local, e.g. vaginal, use or for injection liquids. The active compound is mixed in the usual manner with the formulating components useful for that purpose. The invention is illustrated by the following examples. Example 1 A. Preparation of I isocyano 2 phenyl 1 4 toluenesul phonyl ethene.
