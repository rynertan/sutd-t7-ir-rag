# Electronic voltage regulator with two directional action for alternators.

## Abstract
According to the invention, the regulator supplies excita tion current both in addition and in subtraction, since the supplied current can vary not only in intensity, but also in direction, depending on the signal given by a control device, which is able to regulate the conduction of the regulator both as far as intensity and direction are concerned, according to the result obtained from the comparison between a refer ence voltage 124 and the voltage of the alternator itself, or, in any case, a part of it 123 , said addition or subtraction been performed by electric or magnetic means. According to a preferred form of execution, the electro nic device having a two directional conduction, which achieves these performances consists of a TRIAC 210 which feeds an auxiliary winding in one direction or the other the TRIAC is piloted, in turn, by a control circuit 122 which sends out a triggering signal being in relation to the voltage of the alternator 123 and to a reference voltage 124 . In this form of construction the TRIAC can be replaced by two controlled diodes or by two transistors or similar means, being connected to each other in inverted parallel. According to another form of execution, the circuit of the electronic regulator is made with two controlled diodes, transistors or similar means, which send current having the same direction to two separate windings being wound in opposite directions. Yet another form of execution foresees the use of four controlled diodes, transistors or similar means which con duct in crossed pairs and feed a single auxiliary winding.
