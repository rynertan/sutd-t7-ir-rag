# Method of detecting a broken line up yarn and a detector for use in the method.

## Abstract
A broken line up yarn detecting method characterized in that a light emitter 21 is adapted to travel transversely with respect to a row of yarns W comprising many warps W1, W2... Wn supplied in a line up condition, said light emitter 21 radiat ing a fine beam to the yarns sequentially from one end W1 to the other Wn, and flickerings caused by presence absence of yarns while the beam travels widthwise are transmitted to a photoelectric conversion means 3 and thereafter to a count means 4 where the number of flickerings is electrically counted to obtain the current value for the number of existing yarns, which current value is compared with a threshold by a compa rator which emits a signal ab for indicating an abnormal condi tion if the current value differs from the threshold.
