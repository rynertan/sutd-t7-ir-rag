# Biomedical system with improved marker channel means and method.

## Abstract
A biomedical system such as a pacemaker system having an implantable pacemaker 45 and external apparatus 65,66,76 , with communications capability for communica tion between the implanted device and the external apparatus, characterized by the implanted device having means for cyclically transmitting event and device timing data representative of each prior device interval 62 , the external apparatus having means for receiving and storing the data 62 and for graphically constructing a graphic output 67,75 representative of the timing and event information over a plurality of device cycles. Graphic output preferably includes a linear timing graph representative of timing functions of the implanted device.
