# Detachable connection of members.

## Abstract
A rod 26 including a connector 28 being a part of a front panel is detachably connected to a pair of rods 30 and 32 being part of a base panel. A hook 34 of the connector extends over, and part of the way around the rod 32 to oppose translational move ment of the front panel to the left. The hook 34 engages with the top of the rod 32 and the connector 28 engages with the underside of the rod 30 to prevent the front panel from rotat ing relative to the base in a clockwise direction. A rod 24 comprising part of the front panel abuts the rod 30 to oppose movement of the front panel to the right. To detach the front panel from the base, the front panel is pivoted in an anti clockwise direction and moved down wardly and to the left. Attachment is a reversal of that procedure.

## Description
DETACHABLE CONNECTION OF MEMBERS. This invention relates to two or more members which may be detachably connected together and in particular, although not exclusively, to such members which may be incorporated in a container. According to one aspect of the present invention, in a first member and a second member which are adapted to be detachably connected together, the members are arranged to be connected by causing relative translational movement in one direction and by causing relative pivotal movement in one direction, the members, when they are connected, co operating with each other to oppose further pivotal movement in the one direction and relative translational movement in the other direction.The relative translational and pivotal movement occuring during the connection of the members may be arranged to take place simultaneously, concurrently or separately. It can be seen that the two members can be quickly connected together without the need for complicated catches or other moving parts, and yet still have considerable constraints placed on their relative movement when they are connected. When the members are connected, relative translational movement in the one direction may be arranged to be opposed, to provide a further restriction on the relative movement. Disconnection of the members may be a reversal of the connection procedure. According to another aspect of the present invention, a first member and a second member are adapted to be detachably connected together whereby, when the members are connected together, a connector which extends from the first member co operates with the second member by means of a hook, and pivotal movement of the first member relative to the second member in one direction is opposed by co operation of the hook between the connector and the second member and by co operation of an edge region of the first member with the second member, and translational movement of the first member relative to the second member in a direction opposite to that in which the connector extends from the first member is opposed by the co operation of the hook between the connector and the second member, the first member being detachable from the second member by pivoting the first member in the other direction to allow the co operation of the hook between the connector and the second member to be freed and moving the first member clear by the second member. Either or both of the members may be generally planar. When the members are connected, a portion of the first member may extend across the general extent of the second member whereby abutment of the first member where it extends across the second member opposes relative translational movement in the direction in which the connector extends from the first member. The connector may be arranged to extend back through the second member when the members are connected. The connector may be provided as an extension of a strut which forms part of a partition. The first member may be provided with a plurality of connectors spaced from each other. The present invention also includes a cage in which at least two of the sides are arranged to be detachably connected in accordance with the present invention. The partitions of such a cage may be folded and detached in order to provide a compact storage configuration or quickly assembled. The invention may be carried into practice in various ways, but one embodiment will now be described by way of example and with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a perspective view of a cage for a cat Figure 2A is a view taken on the line IIA of Figure 1 showing the detachable connection of the front with the base of the cage, and Figure 2B is a view similar to that shown in Figure 2A with the base and front in a different relative position. As shown in Figure 1, a cage 10 is made up of six wire mesh panels comprising a front 12, rear 14, ends 16, base 18 and top 20. Each of the front and rear panels 12 and 14 are secured to the base panel 18 by a pair of detachable connections 22 shown in greater detail in Figures 2A and 2B. In Figure 2A, the front panel is sectioned through a horizontally extending rod 24 to which is welded a vertically extending rod 26 which extends into a connector 28 at the lower end thereof. The base panel is sectioned through an outer and an adjacent inner parallel rod 30 and 32 respectively, the rods 30 and 32 extending in the same direction as the rod 24 of the front panel. In the connected position shown in Figure 2A, the rod 24 of the front panel and the rod 30 of the base panel lie along side each other and the connector 28 extends under those rods 24 and 30 and then up through the opening between the rods 30 and 32 of the base panel. At the innermost end of the connector, a hook 34 extends over, and part of the way around, the rod 32 of the base panel. In the connected position, rotational movement of the front panel relative to the base panel in the clock wise direction as viewed in Figure 2A is resisted by abutment of the hook with the rod 32 of the base panel and by engagement of the connector 28 with the rod 30 of the base panel, and possibly also by the rod 24 of the front panel abuting the rod 30. Relative movement of the front panel to the left, as seen in Figure 2A, is resisted by engagement of the hook 34 with the rod 32, and relative movement of the front panel to the right is resisted by abutment of the rod 24 with the rod 30. In order to disconnect the front panel from the base panel, the front panel is pivoted about its common edge with the base panel in an anticlockwise direction, as shown in Figure 2B When the hook 34 is clear of the rod 32, the panels can be manoeuvered to allow the connector to be brought out from between the rods 30 and 32 of the base panel to separate the panels. Thus, in the position shown in Figure 2, the front panel can be moved downwardly and to the left, as viewed in the drawing in order to detach the front panel from the base. However, it will be appreciated that the front panel could be rotated to extend in the same general direction as the base panel prior to removing the connector from the base panel, in which position the front panel could be moved downwardly, or downwardly and to the right or the left in order to remove the connector from the base.Thus, throughout this specification, where the translational movement is said to be in one direction or an opposite direction, that term is intended to cover general rather than specific directions and would, for instance, cover vertically upwards movement of the front panel during connection with the opposite direction including movement to the left That is, it is enough for each direction or opposed direction to be made up with components which are opposed. Connection of the panels is a reversal of the above described sequence. The front panel is not permanently connected to any of the other panels. The rear panel is permanently connected to the top panel by a pair of eyes 36 which extend upwardly from vertical rods at either end of the rear panel and surround a common edge rod 38 of the top panel. The two end panels 16 are each permanently connected to the base panel by a pair of eyes 48 formed at opposed ends of two spaced rods of the base panel which eyes extend around the lower rod 50 of each base panel. In the assembled position shown in Figure 1, the front and rear panels are each prevented from pivoting outwardly about their lower edge by upwardly extending rods 52 at either end of those panels being engaged by hooks 54, the hooks 54 being extensions at either end of a horizontally extending rod 56 adjacent to the upper edge of each end panel. A pair of eyes 58 on extensions of upwardly extending rods 60 on the front panel project through the top panel, and a locking rod 62 passes through those eyes 58 to prevent the top being hinged upwardly about the eyes 36 on the rear panel. A handle 60 is provided on the top panel to allow the case to be carried. Once the locking rod is removed, the top panel can be moved upwards about the hinge to allow cats to be placed into or removed from the cage. When the cage is not required for use, or when the cage is being sent to customers, it can occupy a generally flat configuration. This flat configuration is arrived at by removing the locking rod 62, disengaging the hooks 54 from the front and rear panels, swinging those panels outwardly and disengaging each of the connections 22 with the base panel. The end panels can then fall inwardly, pivoting about the eyes 68 of the base panel to lie on top of the base panel and partially overlapping each other. The top and rear panels can then be folded flat against each other about the hinge provided by the eyes 36, and each flat component of the cage can then be stacked together. Assembly of the cage is a reversal of the above described sequence.
