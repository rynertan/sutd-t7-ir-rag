# Percutaneous access device.

## Abstract
A percutaneous access device 10 having at least one substantially rectilinear passageway 19 that extends be tween the internal region of a living body and the region exterior of the body when the device is anchored therein. A second passageway 18 intersects with the first so as to provide communication between the internal region and the exterior region through the lower portion of the first rectilinear passageway 19 and the second passageway 18 . Disposed within the rectilinear passageway 19 is a plunger 20 having a sealing tip 21 on the distal end thereof and access to the internal region of the body is achieved by withdrawing the sealing tip 21 of the plunger 20 past the point where the second passageway 18 intersects the rectilinear passageway 19 .
