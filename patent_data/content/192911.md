# A pneumatic tire.

## Abstract
A pneumatic tire 10 having a tread portion 11 which consists of a plurality of independent block elements 17 . The block elements 17 can vary in size 17A 17B and 17C have different circumferential lengths and widths. The block elements 17 are arranged in rows 18 extending across the tread and each row 18A 18B or 18C consists only of block elements having substantially the same circumferential length. The rows 18A 18B and 18C contain different num bers of block elements, 6, 5 and 4 elements respectively, such that a multiple of the circumferential length of the block ele ments in any row times the number of elements in that row is essentially a constant.
