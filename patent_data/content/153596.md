# APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR MOUNTING A HEAD ON A MUSICAL INSTRUMENT

## Abstract
A musical instrument, such as a drum, tambourine or banjo has a head formed from a polymeric shell 12 stretched across an opening in a first member 32 having a channel formed along the edge thereof and at least partially filled with an adhesive. The first member 32 is mounted on a second member 26 having a shoulder portion 40 and an axially extending rim therefrom 42 . The first member 32 is mounted on the second member 26 such that the channel in the first member abuts the axially extending rim so as to be securely retained thereby.
