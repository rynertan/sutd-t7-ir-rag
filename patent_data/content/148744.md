# CONTROL CIRCUIT FOR ENERGIZING THE SOLENOID OF A CIRCUIT BREAKER HANDLE OPERATOR

## Abstract
The invention relates to a control circuit for controlling the energization of a handle operator adapted for use with a circuit breaker to effect movement of the circuit breaker handle from one position thereof to another. The control circuit employs a monostable multivibrator including a normally non conducting switch 426 which, upon initial closure of a contact switch 422 , is rendered conducting to supply an energizing pulse to an operating solenoid 424 of the handle operator, and including timing means 442 448 for rendering the switch 426 nonconduct ing again after a predetermined time interval sufficient for the handle operator to complete movement of the circuit breaker handle 42 . The timing means automatically in creases said time interval in proportion to any drop in the energizing voltage sensed.
