# Demulsification and organic matter removal processes.

## Abstract
A water soluble polymer of monoallylamine is used as a demulsifying agent for breaking oil in water emulsions. This enables rapid and efficient separation between the aqueous phase and the liquid organic phase by a variety of conven tional physical techniques such as settling and decantation or centrifugation.
