A preservation device 10 for e.g. wine 32 remaining in a container 30 from which a portion of the contents has been dispensed includes a dispensing nozzle 12 which is mountable in the pouring opening 28 of the container 30 . The nozzle 12 includes a tube 18 which is adjustable relative to the mount 22 portion of the nozzle 12 so as to juxtapose the dispensing end 34 of the tube 18 in contiguity to the surface 36 of the remaining wine. The mount 22 is effective to maintain the dispensing nozzle 12 in the pouring opening 28 during the dispensing of a pressurized gas throghh the dispensing nozzle. The gas is maintained in a cylinder 50 or capsule 62 which is connected by a connecting tube 14 to the nozzle 12 . The mount 22 includes supports 43 defining between them fluid passages permitting the bypassing of excess gas from the container during the dispensing of the gas from the dispensing end of the nozzle.
