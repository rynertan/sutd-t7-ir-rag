# Process for depositing forging lubricant on titanium workpiece.

## Abstract
A coating bath 18 and a process for electrophore tically depositing a forging lubricant precoat 52 on the surface of a titanium workpiece 12 has a specific resistivity in excess of about 400 ohm centimetres in order to retard simultaneous anodization of the titanium during the electrophoretic deposition process. A high lead, moderate silicate, low alkali metal oxide frit is used in suspension in the bath. Advantageously, the bath also includes an anodic electrocoating resin in colloidal dispersion in the bath. By controlling the degree of anodization and preanodization of the titanium, the thickness of the deposited forging lubricant precoat 52 can be closely controlled.
