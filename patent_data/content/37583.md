# Method of fluorometrically measuring the activity of fat degrading enzymes and means for carrying out the method.

## Abstract
The object of the present invention is a new method for fluorometrically assaying the activity of fat degrading enzymes, such as lipases and phospholipases in samples containing said enzyme, such as in serum. According to the method the enzyme containing sample is reacted with a subs trate containing acyl or alkylglycerols or phosphoglycerols into having at least one fluorescent group, such as a pyrene group. The compounds may in addition contain fluorescence quenching groups. The enzyme hydrolyzes the substrate thus giving rise to changes in the fluorescence intensity during the enzyme reaction and the changes in the intensity are meas ured at a specific emission waveength of the fluorescent group employed. The rate of change of the invensity is ortional to the enzyme activity in the sample. The invention concerns also the new compounds contain ing fluorescent groups to be used in the method.
