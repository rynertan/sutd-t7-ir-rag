# Vehicle brake pressure proportioning valves.

## Abstract
A vehicle pressure proportioning valve of the kind in which the operation of a stepped spring loaded proportioning valve plunger 12 is modified by a control mass 36 operative to block a control port 33 above a predetermined inlet pres sure and so prevent pressure reaching a control plunger 29 . If the vehicle is lightly laden the control mass 36 rolls away from the control port 33 and is ineffective to prevent pressure reaching the control plunger 29 . To reduce the need for more than one biassing spring, the control plunger 29 is situated in the same stepped bore as the proportioning valve plunger and may be integral therewith.

## Description
Vehicle Brake Pressure Proportioning Valves The invention relates to vehicle brake pressure proportioning valves. GB. 2 069 643A shows a vehicle brake pressure proportioning valve comprising a housing having an inlet port for connection to a drivercontrolled source of fluid pressure and an outlet port for connection to rear brakes of the vehicle, a stepped proportioning valve plunger slidable in a stepped bore in the housing and having one, relatively small, piston area subject to inlet pressure from the inlet port and another, relatively large, piston area subject to brake pressure at the outlet port, a loading spring which applied a spring biassing load to the proportioning valve plunger in a direction opposing movement of the plunger under the action of brake pressure at the outlet port and metering valve means associated with the proportioning valve plunger for controlling flow between the inlet port and the outlet port, movement of the proportioning valve plunger against the spring biassing load changing the metering valve means from an open state permitting flow between the inlet port and the outlet port to a closed state preventing flow from the inlet port to the outlet port, the metering valve means acting as a non return valve to allow flow from the outlet port to the inlet port, a control mass operative to control flow through a control port between the inlet port and a control chamber by seating on an annular valve seat at one end of the control port, a control plunger movable against a predetermined resilient biassing load by pressure in the control chamber acting on a piston area of the control plunger, and a projection on the control plunger which extends through the control port and the annular valve seat, the control mass having a normal, rest, position in which the control mass is prevented from seating on the annular valve seat by the projection, a seated position permitted by the control plunger having been moved against the resilient biassing load by pressure in the control chamber to allow the control mass to be moved under gravity and seat on the annular valve seat and a disabled position in which the control mass has been moved away from the annular valve by vehicle deceleration. Such a valve will be referred to as a proportioning valve of the kind described . In the proportioning valve of the kind described which is shown in the prior art reference, the control plunger is in a separate bore to the stepped bore in which the proportioning valve is slidable and a separate spring provides the resilient biassing load on the control plunger.Such an arrangement is disadvantageous in that separate springs are required, which need individual selection and control of spring rate and preload during manufacture. Also, at least one additional fluid seal is required, adding to hysterisis in the characteristics of the valve caused by seal friction and increasing the chances of a seal failure. All these disadvantages are additional to the increased cost of the valve due to the multiplicity of components. It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a vehicle brake pressure proportioning valve of the kind described which requires only one biassing spring and the number of other components is minimised. The invention will now be described by way of example and with reference to the accompanying drawings, of which Fig. 1 is a cross section through one embodiment of a vehicle brake pressure proportioning valve according to the invention Fig. 2 is a graph of Brake Pressure against Inlet Pressure Master Cylinder Pressure illustrating the characteristics of the valve shown in Fig. 1 Fig. 3 is a scrap section showing a modification to the proportioning valve shown in Fig. 1 Fig. 4 is a graph of Brake Pressure against Inlet Pressure Master Cylinder Pressure illustrating the characteristics of the modified valve described with reference to Fig. 3 and Fig. 5 is a scrap section showing a further modification to the valve shown in Fig. 1. Referring to Fig. 1, the valve shown has a housing 11 having a stepped proportioning valve plunger 12 slidable in a stepped bore 13 in the housing. An inlet port 14 is connected to a driver controlled source of pressure5 such as a hydraulic master cylinder, and opens into an end chamber 15. An annular piston area is defined by plunger 12 between a large diameter portion which is slidable in a large diameter bore portion 16 and a smaller diameter portion slidable in an annular cup seal 17 and a small diameter bore portion 18 in a collar 19 which is secured in the stepped bore 13 by a circlip 21 and is thus effectively part of the housing 11. The end chamber 15 is connected to the annular chamber between bore portion 16 and seal 17 by a passage 22. An outlet port 23 is connected to rear brakes of the vehicle and opens into the large diameter bore portion 16 on the opposite side to the annular piston area so that brake pressure acts on a relatively small annular piston area. A loading spring 24 applies a spring biassing load to plunger 12 in a direction opposing movement of plunger 12 under the action of brake pressure at outlet port 23 and is retained by a pressed cup 25 secured in a manner described in GB. 1 488 353. The proportioning valve plunger 12 incorporates metering valve means in the form of a spring loaded ball 26 which seats on a step in a passage 27 formed diagonally in plunger 12. The metering valve means co operates with the housing 11 by the action of a fluted pin 28 which is slidable in the diagonal passage 27, one end of the pin abutting a step in the bore 13 and the other end abutting the ball 26. A control plunger 29 is slidable in a further bore portion 31 of the stepped bore and lies adjacent to the proportioning valve plunger 12. The opposite end of the control plunger 29 has an annular piston area open to a control chamber 32 connected to the end chamber 15 by a control port 33. A projection 34 on the control plunger 29 extends through the control port 33 and a resilient valve seat 35 at the end of the control port which opens into the end chamber 15.As the components are shown in Fig. 1, the projection 34 prevents a control mass in the form of a ball 36 from seating on the valve seat 35, this being the normal, rest position of the ball.The control ball 36 can roll a limited distance in the end chamber 15. The valve is mounted on the vehicle so that the plunger axis A is inclined relative to the direction of travel AH, In use with low master cylinder pressures, pressure at the inlet port 14 is transmitted through the end chamber 15, passage 22 and the diagonal passage 27 to the outlet port 23 without significant reduction.This is line 0 A on Fig. 2. If the vehicle has a high gross weight then the metering valve means becomes effective before the deceleration is of such magnitude that the control ball 36 rolls away from its abutment with the projection 34. The metering valve means becomes effective when the inlet pressure reaches a predetermined magnitude at which the pressure loading on the proportioning valve plunger 12 overcomes the biassing preload of the loading spring 24 and moves plunger 12 against the preload. The net piston area of plunger 12 is equivalent to the stem portion which passes through seal 17 and bore portion 18. In such circumstances the control plunger 29 moves with the proportioning valve plunger 12 and allows the control ball 36 to move under gravity into a seated position in which it is seated on the valve seat 35, blocking the control port 33. The valve is arranged so that when both plungers 12 and 29 move together against the loading spring 24, then the control ball 36 can seat before the metering valve ball 26. When the metering valve ball seats it blocks communication through the diagonal passage 27 from the inlet port 14 to the outlet port 23 so that a further increase in inlet pressure acts on the annular piston area of plunger 12 to move the plunger in the direction of the end chamber 15 to unseat the metering valve ball 26.The proportioning valve plunger 12 continues to shuttle to and fro in known manner, seating and unseating the metering valve ball 26 and maintaining the force pressure balance on plunger 12. As inlet pressure increases, the control ball 36 remains seated on seat 35 by the pressure difference between the inlet pressure and the outlet pressure acting on the control plunger 29.The control plunger 29 is thus hydraulically locked in the position wherein the projection 34 just abuts the control ball 36. Sunder these conditions the control plunger 29 becomes spaced from the proportioning valve plunger 12 and brake pressure increases with inlet pressure at a reduced rate. This is illustrated in Fig. 2 which shows brake pressure PB against inlet pressure PM. The line 0 A shows operation before the metering valve means becomes operative, after which the line A B shows brake pressure increasing at the reduced rate, the slope of the line being determined by the areas defined by bore portions 16 and 18. If the gross vehicle weight is low, then the control ball 36 will move away from the projection 34 at a predetermined vehicle decleration which is attained before the metering valve means becomes effective. This is its disabled position and it has no further effect on the operation of the proportioning valve. With increasing inlet pressure, the control port 33 then remains open. The proportioning valve plunger and metering valve means continue to function as described above for the high load condition, but pressure in the control chamber 32 causes the control plunger 29 to exert a load on the proportioning valve plunger 12 in the direction opposing the biassing load of spring 24. This alters the rate at which brake pressure increases with inlet pressure but not the predetermined pressure at which rnetering starts. Hence the characteristic is illustrated by line A C in Fig. 2. In the modification shown in Fig. 3 the control plunger 29A is stepped and has one land slidable in a relatively large diameter bore portion 31A and another land slidable in a relatively small diameter bore portion 31B.An annular chamber 37 between the lands is vented to atmosphere through a vent port 38. In operation with a high gross vehicle weight the valve functions exactly as described above for the Fig. 1 embodiment, the characteristic being the line 0 A B as shown in Fig. 4, in which PB again represents brake pressure and PM represents master cylinder pressure . With a low gross vehicle weight, the valve operates as described above for the Fig. 1 embodiment, except that the control plunger 29A exerts a significant load on the proportioning valve plunger 12 even before the plungers move to allow the metering valve to become operative and inlet pressure increases over brake pressure. This is because of the difference in piston areas presented by the two end faces of the control plunger 29A.This means that tbe rzroportioning valve plunger moves against the loading spring 24 at a lower predetermined inlet pressure, ie. point D in Fig. 4, so that the line D C is followed during metering. In the modification shown in Fig. 5, the control plunger 29C is integral with the metering valve plunger 12C. When the vehicle has a low gross weight, the valve works exactly as described above for the Fig. 1 embodiment.However, when the vehicle has a high gross weight, the control bali 36 blocks the control port 33 as described for Fig. 1 but the control plunger 29C continues to move with the proportioning valve plunger 12C. This tends to cavitate the fluid in the control chamber 32. If the cross sectional area of bore portion 31 is the same as or only slightly below the cross sectional area of bore portion 18 the combined plunger 12C and 29C remains in the position wherein the projection 34 is just abutting the control ball 36 and no further movement of the plungers 12C and 29C occurs for all normal inlet pressures. Thus the metering valve does not come into operation and the proportioning valve continues to provide the same brake pressure at port 23 as inlet pressure at port 14. If the cross sectional area of bore portion 32 is significantly below that of bore portion 18 then the plungers move against the loading spring 24 but at a higher predetermined inlet pressure, since there is no significant pressure in the control chamber 32. The rate of increase of brake pressure with increasing inlet pressure is also changed so that the characteristics are similar to those shown in Fig. 4 for theFig. 3 embodiment. In another modification not shown the plungers 12C and 29C are integral as in Fig. 5 and a passage connects the control chamber 32 with the outlet port 23. This passage contains a non return valve which permits flow from the outlet port 23 to the control chamber 32 only and thus prevents the pressure in the control chamber 32 falling significantly below the brake pressure.Operation of this valve is the same as the valve shown in Fig. 1. In a further modification not shown the plungers 12C and 29C are again integral as in Fig. 5 and a passage connects the control port with a reservoir at atmospheric pressure for example the master cylinder supply tank. contains a non return valve whichThis passage permits flow from the reservoir to the control chamber 32 only and thus prevents the pressure in the control chamber 32 falling significantly below atmospheric pressure.Operation of this valve is the same as the valve shown in Fig. 5, the non return valve preventing cavitation and possible problems due to vapour bubbles. By the use of a single spring 24 to provide the biassing load on the proportioning valve plunger 12 and the control plunger 29 only one selection of spring rate and preload is necessary. In the particular embodiment of the invention described the preload is readily adjusted during manufacture by the method described in GB. 1 488 353.
