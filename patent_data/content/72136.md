# LEAVENING ACID FOR FRUCTOSE CONTAINING BAKED GOODS AND USE THEREOF IN THE PRODUCTION OF BAKED GOODS AND CAKES CONTAINING SUCH LEAVENING SYSTEM

## Abstract
A new leavening acid comprises a slow acting phosphate leavening acid having a 2 minute donut dough rate of reaction between 15 and 35 evolved CO₂ and a 10 minute donut dough rate of reaction of between 20 and 60 evolved CO₂ and an organic acid such as fumaric acid, citric acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, lactic acid, succinic acid, adipic adic and mixtures thereof. The new leavening acid is useful in overcoming the dif ficulties such as browning and uneven color associated with the use of reducing sugars and particularly fructose in baked goods.
