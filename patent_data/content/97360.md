# Modular self routing PCM switching network with virtual channel routing control for distributed control telephone exchanges.

## Abstract
The PCM switching network is based on the use of switching units UC1a ... UC8c each equipped with a local controller using a microprocessor CTR1a ... CTR8c , ancillary circuits for diagnosis CDTE1 ... CDTU5 , ancillary circuits for exchanging messages relating to network control between the local controllers CRT1a ... CTR8c and between local controllers and the distributed telephone control units CTFa ... CTFc , and ancillary circuits RTBE1 ... RTBU5 providing virtual channels on the speech channels themselves for transmission of said messages in a direction opposite to that of speech. Said switching units UC1a ... UCBc make it possible to provide self routing modular PCM switching network struc tures for distributed control telephone exchanges.
