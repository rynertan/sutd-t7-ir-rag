# Aluminium alloy foil for cathode of electrolytic capacitors.

## Abstract
An aluminium alloy foil for forming the cathode of an elec trolytic capacitor is produced from a continuously cast alumi num alloy plate preferably containing 0.1 to 0.3 of copper, and 0.005 to 0.01 of titanium. The copper increases the capa citance of the foil and the titanium prevents cracking.
