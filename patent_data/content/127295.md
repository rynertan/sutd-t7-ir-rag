## Description
TEST PROBE ASSEMBLY FOR IC CHIPS Background of the InventionField of Invention This invention relates generally to the testing of integrated circuit chips, and, more particularly to a microelectronic test probe assembly for this purpose. Many circuits and complex multi stage electronic systems, previously regarded as economically unfeasible and impractical, are now realizable in integrated circuit form. The fabrication of a single crystal monolithic circuit involves the formation of diodes, transistors, resistors and capacitors on a single microelectronic substrate. In practice, a microelectronic substrate for semiconductor integrated circuits is sealed on a silicon wafer, the circuit patterns being applied to the wafer by photolithography. Each wafer contains the patterns of many identical integrated circuits, the wafer being sliced into dice , each die or chip containing a single integrated circuit. In a typical integrated circuit IC chip, the input, output, power supply and other terminals of the circuit are formed by metallized contacts, usually deployed along the margins of the circuit pattern. The outline of the chip is either square or rectangular, and the marginal locations of the contacts thereon depend on the circuit configuration and the available marginal space. In some instances, therefore, the contacts may lie in uniform rows along the margins, and in other cases, the contacts may be randomly spaced from each other. For the purpose of testing any type of integrated circuit patterns, before the application thereto of leads to connect the contacts to other components, various types of test probe cards have been developed. In one well known form, the probe card consists of a printed circuit board having an opening or port therein to provide access to an IC pattern. This opening is surrounded by a circle of conductive pads connected by the traces of the printed circuit to terminals on the card which, in turn, are connected to test equipment appropriate to the circuit. The number of pads in the circle determine the maximum capacity of the probe card.If, for example, the card has forty eight pads, it is capable of testing IC patterns having fortyeight contacts or less. In setting up a probe card for a particularIC chip pattern, probes constituted by needles of tungsten are affixed to selected pads, the needles extending across the opening. The length and orientation of each needle is such that its point is adapted to engage a respective contact on the IC pattern. To assemble a probe card for this pattern, one must attach needles to those pads which are most conveniently located with respect to the contacts on the chip. The stretch of each needle depends on the distance between its pad and the particular contact to be engaged. Hence the needles in a conventional probe card vary in length. Since all of the contacts in the IC pattern lie in a common plane, and must be simultaneously engaged in order to carry out testing, it is essential that all needle points lie in a plane parallel to the common IC plane. Consequently, a fundamental requirement of a probe card is planarization of the needle points. The nature of conventional probe cards and the character of the assembly fixtures for setting up the probe positions for such cards are such that it is virtually impossible to assemble probes with needle points lying exactly in the same plane. with a view to providing an improved micro electronic test probe card, the Garretson et 21. patents 3,835,381 and 3,905,098 disclose a structure in which needle like probes formed of tungsten wire are supported on the tapered face of a dielectric base ring surrounding a circular opening in the card, the wires being in a generally conical array with respect to the opening. A layer of dielectric material adherent to the tapered surface of the ring acts to secure the wires thereto, the wires being embedded in the layer. The outer ends of the wires are connected to terminals on the card, whereas the inner ends leading to the apex of the cone are bent down to form tips which engage the respective contacts on the IC chip to be tested. Because the tips of the needles must all lie in a common plane, the angles of the needles in the conical array thereof must be adjusted relative to the tapered surface of the ring to engage the respective contacts on the chip. Thus a steeper angle is required to reach a contact, say, at the corner of the rectangular chip than a contact displaced from a corner. To this end, feeler gauges are used by Garretson et al. to control the positions and locations of each needle on the tapered face of the ring. After the needles have been carefully adjusted to assume their proper angles, an epoxy or other dielectric material is superimposed over the array of needle probes so as to embed the probes at their assigned angle and position in the epoxy. The assembly so arranged is then heated to cause hardening of the epoxy to thereby retain the array of needles at their selected sites. In practice, it is a relatively difficult matter to construct a test probe card of the Garret son et al. type for to create the necessary conical array of needles, one must use a jig having a conical configuration and because the needles must be positioned at various angles relative to the conical surface of the jig, the needles make point contact with the jig only at the back end thereof and tend to fall out of position. Also, it is difficult to set the needles relative to the jig to allow proper clearance therebetween for epoxy flow. A further disadvantage is that because the needles are at different angles, the scrub characteristics of the needles are not uniform. Moreover, as needles are added to the jig, it is impossible to control the final angle of each needle, as all needles in the jig have slightly different angles due to the cone effect. Summary of Invention In view of the foregoing, the main object of this invention is to provide a probe test assembly for testing integrated circuit chips in which a radial array of fine wires, all lying in a horizontal plane, are supported on a mounting ring surrounding a circular port in a card, the wires converging toward the central region of the port below which is exposed the chip to be tested, the leading ends of the wires being double bent to define obtuse angle needles whose tips engage the respective contacts of the chip. Among the advantages of a probe test assembly in accordance with the invention over a prior art assembly in which the wires lie in a conical array is that the angle between each needle and the surface of the chip or other microelectronic device under test is uniform. As a consequence, all needle tips in this array thereof may be identically viewed under a microscope, thereby facilitating alignment and placement of the probe card when in use for electrical testing and measurement. Also characteristic of a test probe assembly in accordance with the invention is the uniform and consistent scrubbing of the needle point of contact against the microelectronic device under test. Yet another object of the invention is to provi dela probe test assembly in which the radial array of wires lies in a horizontal plane, thereby obviating the need for feeler gauges to locate and orient the wires on a probe ring fixture, as in prior art arrangements. It is a further object of the invention to provide an efficient and reliable test probe assembly which may be fabricated without difficulty and manufactured at relatively low cost. Briefly stated, these objects are attained in a test probe assembly for checking an integrated circuit chip before terminal leads are applied to the contacts thereof which are deployed on the chip in a common plane. The assembly includes a planar insulation card provided with a port and having a printed circuit thereon whose traces are connected to a plurality of test terminals connectable to external testing equipment. Surrounding the port and bonded to the card is a mounting ring of dielectric material having a flat face on which is supported a radial array of fine wires.These are maintained in their assigned positions by a layer of dielectric material adherent to the face, the wires being embedded in the layer The wires cantilever across the port and converge toward the central region thereof, below which is disposed the chip to be tested, the leading ends of the wires being double bent to define obtuse angle needles whose tips engage the respective contacts on the chip. The trailing ends of the wire which diverge outwardly from the ring are soldered to the traces whereby each needle is connected to a respective test terminal.

Description of InventionThe Assembly Referring now to Figs. 1 and 2, there is illustrated a preferred embodiment of a test probe assembly in accordance with the invention for checking an integrated circuit chip before leads are connected to the contacts of the chip. The function of the test probe assembly is to engage the chip contacts and connect them to test terminals which in turn are connected to external test equipment so that the chip circuits may be fully tested to be sure that it satisfies the specifications there for before the chip is permanently connected to its associated components. The assembly includes a planar printed circuit board or card 10 fabricated of synthetic plastic or other insulating material which is structurally stable and of adequate strength. Card 10, which in the embodiment illustrated is circular in form, is provided with a circular central opening or port 11 to provide access to the chip to be tested. In practice, the planar card may be rectangular or in any other suitable configuration and the port, rather than being circular, may be oblong or in any other geometrical form. Formed on one face of card 10 by printed circuit techniques are two sets 12 and 13 of radial traces which are interleaved. Traces 13 are connected to test terminals 14 in an outer circular series thereof adjacent the periphery of the card. Traces 12, which are somewhat shorter than traces 13, are connected to test terminals 15 in an inner circular series thereof concentric with the outer series.The advantage of this interleaved arrangement of radial traces is that it makes possible a high density of test terminals in a relatively small area. Each test terminal on the card takes the form of a metal grommet inserted in a card hole and adapted to receive a plug in pin 16, as shown inFig. 6, whereby the assembly can be plugged into a test equipment socket rather than being wires thereto terminal by terminal. In practice, the grommets, instead of being discrete elements, may be formed by plating the hole surfaces. Also, the terminals may take the form of edge contacts plated on the surface of the card. Surrounding port 11 and secured to the card, as shown in Figs. 3 and 4, is a mounting ring 16 which may be formed of ceramic, anodized aluminium or other dielectric material. The ring thus has a flat face parallel to the plane of the card for supporting at a raised position a radial array of fine wires 17, preferably made of tungsten. These wires are maintained in their assigned positions by a layer 18 of dielectric material which is adhered to the face of the ring, the wires being embedded therein. In practice, the layer may be molded of epoxy resin. Wires 17 cantilever across port 11 and converge toward the central region 19 thereof, as shown in Fig. 4, just below which is the integrated circuit chip 20 to be tested. Chip 20, as shown in Fig. 5, has contacts 21 deployed thereon, all lying in a common horizontal plane, the contacts being located adjacent the margins of the chip. As best seen in Fig. 3, the leading end of each wire is double bent to define an obtuse angle needle 17N. The knee angle is such that the tip of the needle which engages a contact on the chip, is at right angles to wire 17, this angle being uniform throughout the array. All needle tips in the array can therefore be viewed identically under the microscope. This improves alignment and placement of the finished test probe assembly when in use for electrical test and measurement. In practice, angle need not be a right angle. The trailing ends 17T of wires 17 which diverge outwardly from the ring, as shown in Fig. 1, soldered to individual traces on the printed circuit, so that each needle is connected to a respective test terminal 14 or 15 in the inner and outer series thereof. The number of wires 17 in the array and their placement is determined by the number of contacts 21 and their placement on the integrated circuit chip 20 to be tested. Thus in the chip illustrated in Fig. 5, there are a relatively small number of contacts 21 deployed on chip 20 hence an equally small number of wires are required in the radial array, the placement of the wires being determined by the placement of these contacts. In practice, a much greater ninuber of contacts and wires may be involved. Fabrication of Sub A samhly Referring now to Fig. 7, there is shown a jig 22 for fabricating a sub assembly in accordance with the invention, the ub assembly being in the form of a spider like structure in which a radial array of needles are supported on mounting ring 16 and maintained at their assigned positions by a layer 18 of epoxy material adherent to the face of the ring, the wires being embedded therein. Jig 22 is provided with a planar face 22 and a central circular bore 23. An annular channel 24 is formed in the jig concentric with bore 23 to receive the flow of the moldable, resinous dielectric material. Tungsten wires 17 are laid down on planar face 22P to create the desired radial array, the obtuse angle needles 17N lying within the opening, with the needle tip being received in the separate apertures of a patterned mask 25. This mask is preferably formed of a thin sheet of Mylar in a selected pattern determined by the contact position of the chip to be tested. Channel 24 is of uniform depth to form the, desired thickness of the adhered layer 18. These wires may be of tungsten, berylliumcopper or other suitable metal alloys. After the wires are properly set up on the jig, ring 16, whose underside is coated with epoxy, is brought down on the array and clamped to the jig in a fixture. This fixture is then placed in an oven and heated to a temperature of about 2OO0F for a period, such as one hour, sufficient to effect curing and hardening of the resinous layer of dielectric epoxy in which the wires are embedded. The resultant spider sub assembly is removed from the fixture, the ring is bonded to the card around the port therein, and finally the trailing ends of the wires are soldered to the traces of the printed circuit. While there has been shown a preferred embodiment of TEST PROBE ASSEMBLY FOR IC CHIPS, it will be appreciated that many changes and modifications may be made therein without, however, departing from the essential spirit thereof.
