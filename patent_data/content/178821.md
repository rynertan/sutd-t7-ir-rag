# PROGRAMMABLE AUTOMATIC CABLE EQUALIZER

## Abstract
The circuit 10 has a gain section which includes a first AGC circuit 12 . The output of the gain section goes to a signal shaping section which includes a biquadratic filter 24 , a summer 45 , and a second AGC circuit 40 . The two AGC circuits 12, 40 are controlled by respective separate peak detectors 20, 50 and are noninteracting. For short cables, only the first AGC circuit 12 is active. For long cables, the first AGC circuit 12 is set at its gain breakpoint and the second AGC circuit 40 alone has active control. The shaping section includes a biquadratic filter 24 which is a tandem arrangement of a low pass filter 26 , an inverter 28 , and an integrator 32 . The low pass output 35 of the integrator 32 is connected to the noninverting input of the a summing amplifier 45 . The input 42 of the second AGC circuit 40 is connected to the band pass output 33 of the inverter 28 , while its output 44 is connected to the inverting input of the summing amplifier 45 . The input of the second peak detector 50 is connected to the output 48 of the summing amplifier 45 and its output is connected to the control node 52 of the second AGC circuit 40 . Operational amplifiers G1,G2,G3,G4 of the first peak detector 20 , the low pass filter 26 , the integrator 32 , and the summing amplifier 45 are designed to be programm able by means of decoders 22, 36, 38, 46 to permit the equalizer 10 to accommodate different data rates.
