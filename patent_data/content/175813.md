## Description
This application relates generally to delivery systems for liquids and, more particularly, to a system providing for the delivery of drinking liquids to a protective mask enabling the wearer of the mask to create a closed system for ingestion without exposing the liquid to contamination. This is known from US A 4 505 310. Use of chemically active and debilitating substances requires the use of protective masks and clothing, making normal eating and drinking impossible. When using toxic chemicals, a workman may have to plan a work schedule which provides for appropriate breaks, including time to detoxify such protective clothing and allow its removal. However time consuming and inconvenient such procedures may be, they deal with a far less life threatening situation than that encountered by a person under attack by chemical agents. The immediacy and reliability of the protective measures required under such attacks exemplifies most sharply the inadequacies of existing liquid delivery systems. Accordingly, with the understanding that commercial, or non combat use of the present invention is contemplated, use under combat situations will be preferrably presented. Chemical warfare has, in the past, been demonstrated to be of devastating physical and psychological effect. Chemical agents, such as toxic gases are pervasive, difficult to detect, create immediate and long lasting disabling effects, and are available in substantial and sophisticated forms to cause a wide range of injury and or disability from narcosis, discomfort, and disorientation all the way to paralysis and death. To defend against such combat measures, attempts have been made to create protective clothing and protective masks in order to insulate a wearer from the effects of offensively utilized tactical chemical agents. Where such clothing and or masks are effective to shield or filter the particular chemical agent involved, the wearer will be protected so long as the integrity of the protective garb remains intact. It is characteristic of chemical agents that, once deployed, they may remain effective for a substantial period of time afterward before naturally occurring atmospheric and meteorologic action either disperses, dilutes, or removes them from the environment. As an example, certain chemical substances dispensed in aerosol form may be degraded or altered by the action of direct sunlight, while others, being water soluble, may be scrubbed from the atmosphere and or landscape during rainstorms. Nevertheless, it is an accepted consequence of such forms of warfare that protective clothing, once donned, may have to be worn for an indeterminate amount of time until it is established that the danger to the wearer has abated. Protection of the wearer is only one aspect of such protective garments. Another consideration is the ability of the wearer to carry out assigned duties even when prolonged use of such protective clothing is required. This means that such garments must not only enable the wearer to see and to communicate, but, advantageously, must also make some provision for the ingestion of liquids in order to replace those liquids lost by the body through perspiration which may be heightened by the wearing of protective clothing of impermeable or semipermeable characteristics, and by increased or stimulated body reactions resulting from participation in frightening or stressful situations. Exemplary of a protective mask designed to meet such emergency situations is the mask illustrated and discussed in United States Patent No. 3,731,717, issued May 8, 1973. Other versions of such masks include a full, overlapping hood which completely covers the wearer s head, neck, and portions of the shoulders, but which depends for its effectiveness upon a system of air filtration typified by the mask shown in the above mentioned patent. The wearer s incoming air supply is directed through a canister containing activated charcoal or other mechanical and chemical filtering agents selected to be effective against the particular chemical agent or agents expected to be encountered. Other portions of the mask must form a substantially air tight protective fit about the wearer s face and head. This is important because some chemical agents are absorbed not only through the respiratory system, but may enter the body through exposed skin surfaces. Transparent eye pieces are provided to enable the wearer to see through the mask, however, the range of vision is somewhat obstructed by the non transparent portions of the mask. Thus, when the protective mask is properly in place, the wearer is unable to eat or drink normally without breaching the integrity of the mask s protective features. This poses a critical problem, particularly with respect to body fluids, which must be constantly and continuously replenished to avoid the serious effects of dehydration. The above mentioned patent provides a means by which the wearer of such a mask may ingest liquids without requiring removal of the mask. As a part of the mask construction, a mouthpiece mounted on the inside of the mask is positionable to engage the wearer s mouth. An inlet tube attached to the mouthpiece extends through an air tight fitting to the exterior of the mask, with the tube terminating in a plug. A standard United States Army canteen is fitted with a cap having a built in fitting to accept the plug formed at the end of the inlet tube so that when the plug is inserted into the cap, a closed system is created which includes the interior of the canteen, the interior of the cap and plug the inlet tube, and the mouthpiece. However, use of such a system provides serious inconveniences and disadvantages which serve to complicate the procedure for obtaining such liquids and, in the case of a combat soldier, exposes the soldier to unwarranted hazards and dangers encountered during the conduct of the soldier s assigned mission. As set forth in said patent, and as set forth in U. S. Army instruction manuals, such as No. 3 54 EL 2, at ORDG. 1038 29, pp. 2 49 to 2 50, use of the above described system requires the soldier to remove the canteen from its holder, remove the protective flap covering the canteen cap, visually locate the plug at the end of the drinking tube and visually locate the cap on the canteen, insert the plug into the cap, and elevate the canteen above the level of the mouthpiece so that the liquid will flow under the influence of gravity from the canteen, down the tube, and through the mouthpiece. This type of closed system is further complicated because the canteen itself cannot be vented to the atmosphere or else the liquid contained therein will become contaminated by the chemical agent present. This means that constant flow will not take place by gravity alone. In order to remedy this situation, the user of such a system is instructed to blow through the mouthpiece in order to inject air into the canteen, and to thereafter suck liquid from the canteen via the drinking tube and mouthpiece. Such blowing and sucking operations are tiring and time consuming, and seriously limit the rate at which the liquid can be drained from the canteen. Under conditions which have already created physical and psychological stress, such as those encountered on the battlefield, any additional physical effort should preferrably and necessarily be avoided. Another disadvantage of the above described system is that the user must use two hands, which means whatever activity the user is carrying out must be interrupted. The user must also raise the canteen above the level of the mouthpiece and hold it there in a tiring and awkward posture. Apart from the physical effects and consequent fatigue, this means that the user may be forced to maintain a relatively vulnerable posture in order to perform so simple an act as the taking of a drink. When the user has finished drinking, the plug must be removed from the canteen cap, the protective flap must be sealed across the cap socket, and the canteen must be returned to its holder. During this operation, of course, the cap and plug are exposed to possible contamination by any chemical agents present in the air, and must he decontaminated prior to connection every time a drink is required. Given the nature of certain chemical agents, the toxic effects of such agents are enhanced when they are utilized at night, particularly those agents which are degraded by higher temperatures or direct sunlight. This means that use of protective garments and liquid delivery systems for such garments may most frequently occur when visibility is at its poorest, thereby jeopardizing the secure and correct decontamination and connection of the above described system. U.S. A 2,950,030 discloses a dispenser for hairdressing liquids in which a bulb pump is used to withdraw hairdressing liquids from a container . The dispenser in this publication is dependent upon atmospheric pressure operating on the surface of the liquid column 4, lines 58 61 . Also the dispenser in this publication is dependent upon a particular orientation of the container see column 4, lines 8 and 9 . Accordingly, the need exists for a liquid delivery system which would substantially overcome the above identified problems, thereby adding to the security and continued health and well being of one forced to adopt the use of such protective clothing and masks for indeterminate periods of time. The need also exists for such a delivery system to be readily adaptable to protective equipment already in widespread use, making deployment of such a system compatible to both old and newly manufactured equipment. The present invention provides a system for delivering liquid to a protective mask, said mask being of the type having a drinking mouthpiece assembly on the interior thereof, positionable at the mouth of a user for ingestion of said liquid and an inlet tube liquid tightly attached to said mouthpiece and extending outside said mask, said system comprising a supply tube in liquid tight fluid communication with said inlet tube a plug assembly liquid tightly attached to said supply tube and a canteen assembly including means for storing a quantity of said liquid therewithin, said canteen assembly including means to couple said plug assembly liquid tightly thereto characterized by a hand pump which is liquid tightly attached between said supply tube and said inlet tube means for draining said liquid storage means, said draining means being liquid tightly attached to said coupling means and disposed within said liquid storage means said liquid storage means, said draining means, said coupling, and said plug, said supply tube, said pump, said inlet tube and said mouthpiece defining a liquid flowpath through which liquid may be withdrawn from said liquid storage means said liquid storage means including elastic memory means enabling said liquid storage means to partially collapse upon liquid being withdrawn from said liquid storage means to compensate for the pressure differential between said liquid storage means and atmospheric pressure as said liquid is withdrawn without exposing said liquid to the atmosphere. The present invention also provides a system for delivering liquid to a protective mask, said mask being of the type having a drinking mouthpiece assembly on the interior thereof, positionable at the mouth of a user for ingestion of said liquid and an inlet tube liquid tightly attached to said mouthpiece and extending outside said mask, said system comprising a supply tube in liquid tight fluid communication with said inlet tube a plug assembly liquid tightly attached to said supply tube and a canteen assembly including means for storing a quantity of said liquid therewithin, said canteen assembly including means to couple said plug assembly liquid tightly thereto characterized by a hand pump which is liquid tightly attached between said supply tube and said inlet tube means for draining said liquid storage means, said draining means being liquid tightly attached to said coupling means and disposed within said liquid storage means said liquid storage means, said draining means, said coupling, and said plug, said supply tube, said pump, said inlet tube and said mouthpiece defining a liquid flowpath through which liquid may be withdrawn from said liquid storage means said canteen assembly including a substantially rigid outer shell terminating in a neck portion, said liquid storage means including a flexible bag like liner disposed within said shell, and vent means in said shell to compensate for the pressure differential between said liquid storage means and atmospheric pressure as said liquid is withdrawn without exposing said liquid to the atmosphere. Another feature of the present invention is a flexible drain tube attached to the interior of the canteen structure cap and extending into the canteen, and having a weighted end distal from the cap whereby the drain tube will automatically drop to the lowermost portion of the canteens, i.e., that portion of the canteen at which the liquid level is at its highest regardless of the position in which the canteen is held. The supply tube is preferably coiled to present a compact, easily stored construction when not in use, and which may be stretched to connect the mask and the canteen structure, when the canteen structure is carried in a typically belt worn carrying case. The canteen then need not be removed during the drinking operation. A protective insulating sheath may be used to cover the supply tube as an added measure of protection against freezing, condensation, physical damage, or to coordinate use of the system with selected uniforms or camouflage requirements. An additional chemical and or mechanical filter may be inserted to provide an additional measure of protection against contamination of the liquid. Hand pumping of the bulb type siphon pump thus provides a supply of liquid extending in a path from the interior of the canteen structure to the users mouth without being exposed to the atmosphere and, thereby, any chemical agent or contaminate present. The pump may be supplied with a check valve preventing the contents of the supply tube from draining back into the canteen between uses, thus making it unnecessary to prime the system each time it is used. Yet another aspect of the present invention involves the provision and use of a central reservoir or drinking refilling tank structure to enable a user to drink therefrom by connecting the supply tube directly thereto, or to refill a depleted canteen by connecting a refill tube thereto and applying a sufficient pressure differential between the reservoir and the interior of the canteen to refill the canteen. These and further aspects of the present invention may best be understood by referring to the accompanying drawings, wherein Referring now to Fig. 1, the numeral 10 indicates generally a protective mask of the type hereinabove described. One such mask currently in distribution by the United States government is identified as the M17Al mask. As an integral part of the mask structure, an inlet tube 11 extends, via voice transmitter housing 12 and fluid tight fitting 13 to the interior of mask 10 where it is liquid tightly secured to a drinking mouthpiece not herein specifically shown. Connection of the inlet tube to the mouthpiece may be made in any number of convenient or well known manners to provide a permanent and durable liquid tight fit. Typically, the mouthpiece is hinged and spring biased to remain away from the user s mouth during normal conditions. An operating tab 14 extending to the exterior of mask 10 may be used to move the mouthpiece down toward the user s mouth where it may be grasped by the user until drinking is completed. Upon release, the tube will return to its original rest position within mask 10. Inlet tube 11 is attached at its other end to bulb siphon pump 15 at fluid tight fitting 16, again, by any known method which provides a durable and liquid tight connection. Pump 15 is preferably formed of heavyweight rubber or rubber like material which will flex easily when compressed by the user s hand, and which will retain its liquid tight properties over extended periods of time. The inlet side of pump 15 is attached to supply tube 17 at fluid tight fitting 18. Supply tube 17 is preferably permanently coiled about a substantial portion of its length, as shown at 19, so that it may be compactly stored yet may be extended over a relatively long distance. Supply tube 19 terminates in plug 20 which, in the present preferred embodiment, is of a type already known and in use, its distinguishing characteristic being that it cooperates with a socket construction 21 which, in the preferred embodiment illustrated, is an integral part of canteen cap 22. As an example, the plug structure shown in U.S. Patent No. 3,731,717 may be utilized. When assembled, plug 20 extends into canteen cap 22 as seen in Fig. 2. Cap cover 52 may be provided as hingedly attached to cap 22 to cover and protect socket assembly 22 when not in use. Use of mechanical restraining means, such as a rubber strap 57 or retaining spring, may be attached at one end to cap 22 and at the other end to plug 20 to prevent accidental disengagement. Referring now to Fig. 2, a preferred version of cap construction 23 includes canteen cap 22, socket assembly 21, and drain tube 24 liquid tightly connected to socket assembly 21 as shown in 25. Again, connection of tubes such as drain tube 24 to socket assembly 21 may be accomplished in a number of well known manners to perform the function required in the present invention. Drain tube 24 is formed of a thin, flexible, plastic material selected to avoid stiffening or hardening in low temperatures, and includes a ballast piece 26 positioned proximate inlet 27 of drain tube 24. The weight of ballast piece 26 is selected to deflect drain tube 24 by the force of gravity downward within canteen 28 such that inlet 27 will be positioned at that point within canteen 28 where undispensed liquid will also be drawn by gravity. This result will obtain regardless of the position in which canteen 28 is placed. Referring now to Fig. 1, numeral 28 indicates a canteen construction which, in a preferred embodiment, is formed from a heavy gauge polyethylene type plastic material which, when properly shaped, may be flexed many times without suffering material fatigue and failure. Fig. 5 illustrates generally use of a standard canteen 29 manufactured from the same type of material molded, however, into an essentially rigid structure not designed to flex during use. As will be hereinbelow discussed, the capability of canteen 28 to successfully absorb such flexing action is an important feature of the present invention. As discussed above, conventional practice requires the withdrawal of liquid from canteen 29 via suction tube 30 directly into the user s mouth. The suction force required to draw liquid from canteen 29 is provided by the user sucking on the internal mouthpiece of protective mask 31. As is well known, with a structure having rigid walls, as the contents of the structure are withdrawn by suction, a partial vacuum is created within the structure as the volume of air originally present in the structure expands to fill a larger volume. When the pressure differential between the interior pressure of the structure and the external atmospheric pressure becomes too great, the structure may collapse or permanently deform. In order to prevent this occurrence, as described above, users of the system illustrated by Fig. 5 must alternately suck liquid through drinking tube 30 and blow air through drinking tube 30 in an attempt to equalize the pressure inside canteen 29 with the outside atmospheric pressure. Referring now to Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, canteen 28 of the present invention is preferably molded with a cross section of individual stepped sections such as those shown at 32, 33, 34 and 35 joined at bends, or knees 36, 37, 38 and 39. The combination of the stepped sections and bends enables the sides of canteen 28 to flex or partially collapse in a bellows like manner in response to the differential in pressure caused by the draining of liquid from canteen 28. It is a well known characteristic of such plastic materials that they retain a living memory of the original shape within which they were molded and, when such bends are properly molded, may be distorted from and returned to said original shape many times without sustaining material fatigue or structural damage. Referring now to Fig. 4, in yet another version of the present invention, a canteen structure may include a more or less conventional rigid outer shell 40 within which a thin, flexible bag like liner 41 may be disposed. The liquid to be dispensed will be contained within liner 41. Preferrably, liner 41 may be of a size to fill the interior of shell 40 and extend through the neck 42 of said shell, as at 47, thereafter to be sealed off by screwing cap 22 onto the threads 43 typically formed on the exterior surface of neck 42. As shown at 44 of Fig. 4, a valve structure, or plug, may be utilized to allow the interior of shell 40 to communicate with the atmosphere. Thus, as liquid is drawn through drain tube 45 from liner 41, liner 41 is free to collapse within rigid shell 40, allowing easy withdrawal of the liquid. Valve or plug 44 may be constructed so as to create a liquid tight seal when in the closed position so that shell 40 may be used as a canteen in a conventional manner without a liner where protection from contaminating agents is not a consideration. Once liner 41 is completely evacuated, it may be discarded and a fresh, sterile, liner inserted and refilled to provide another safe source of liquid. Preferrably, inlet tube 11, pump 15, supply tube 17, and plug 20 remain integral with and permanently attached to mask 10, and may be conveniently and unobtrusively stored with mask 10 in a more or less conventional carrying container. Use of the present invention may be illustrated by referring to Fig. 6. After donning mask 10, the user stretches supply tube 17 to enable plug 20 to reach canteen 28 carried, for example, in holder 46. After carrying out any prescribed decontamination of plug 20 and or cap 22, the user inserts plug 20 into cap 22 to complete a flow path from canteen 28 to the drinking mouthpiece in mask 10. By grasping pump 15 and squeezing, liquid will then be drawn from canteen 28 and will be delivered to the user via supply tube 17, inlet tube 11, and the mouthpiece of mask 10. Such delivery requires use of only one hand to operate pump 15, and may be effected whether the user is in an upright, prone, or other position. Retainer straps 48 may be provided to anchor pump 15 to the user s clothing in order to keep the position of pump 15 constant. Plug 20 may be left permanently attached until canteen 28 is empty, thus obviating the need to reconnect the system everytime the user wishes to drink. Fig. 7 illustrates yet another version of the present invention, and consists of a construction including plug 20, supply tube 17, pump 15, and an adapter including a liquid tight connection to pump 15 at one end, and a connector 49 corresponding in construction to socket assembly 21 at the other end. This version would enable attachment to the standard coupling arrangement now in use as shown in Fig. 5, and would convert such an arrangement to utilize the present invention. Standard coupling 50 would then be connectable to adapter 49 and, thereby, to the remaining components in the present invention, making immediate conversion of all existing protective masks feasible. Connection to adapter 49 may be done on an as needed basis, under field conditions, using proper decontaminative procedures, or it could be done prior to such use on a permanent basis, to be stored with the mask. Permanent connection may be enhanced by utilizing an air tight protective covering formed, e.g. from shrink wrap material to prevent disconnection and as added protection from air borne chemical agents. In Fig. 8, a protective sheath 51 is shown intended to provide protection to supply tube 17. Sheath 51 may be insulated to counter such problems as freezing of liquid in supply tube 17 in cold weather, or preventing condensation along supply tube 17 in humid weather. Protection may also be afforded against dirt, abrasion, or kinking. Sheath 51 may be provided in a variety of colors, based upon demands of uniform coloration or camouflage, or to indicate the conditions with which sheath 51 is intended for use, such as blue for cold weather, green for humid weather, and the like. In use, sheath 51 may be drawn over plug 20 and extend to or past pump 15, and may be stored with mask 10 until its use is required. Other sheath constructions may be openable lengthwise, as by zippers, snaps, or the like, making use of such a sheath possible even after connection to canteen 28 has been made, without requiring disconnection and attendant decontamination of couplings. Testing and use of the present invention and the system characterized by that shown in Fig. 5 has demonstrated the increased efficiency provided by the present invention. Test results show that liquid may be delivered to the user at twice the rate of the prior art system. In yet another aspect of the present invention, provision may be made to include an additional in line filtration element for those circumstances where the liquid itself is suspected of containing contaminating material. A cartridge type combined mechanical and chemical filter may bemade a part of the present invention in a number of effective manners. One such filter is of the general type wherein contaminants such as microorganisms and water borne impurities are removed in a single pass from the liquid supply to the user s mouth by packings of both activated charcoal and microbicidal resins. One such construction is described in United States Patent No. 4,298,475, and is sold under the trademark Pocket Purifier as manufactured by Calco, Ltd., of Rosemont, Illinois. Said filtration element is preferrably provided in removable and replaceable versions insertable between canteen 28 and mask 10, and may find particular usefulness where canteens may have been filled with water which requires further treatment to make it safely potable, yet the canteens which hold the water cannot be opened for purification because of the presence of airborne chemical agents. In Fig. 9, a filtration cartridge holder 53 is shown, adapted at one end 54 to couple with cap 22 of canteen 28, and at its other end 55 to couple with plug 20. Holder 53 may have a filtration cartridge insert 56 of the general type described above removably held therein, which may be replaced when spent. While cartridge 56 may be placed wherever convenient, one advantage to placing it at canteen cap 22 is to avoid passible contamination of the system elements downstream of canteen 22. Use or replacement of holder 53 and cartridge 56 would be subjected to the same decontamination procedures followed when attaching plug 20 to cap 22. Figs. 10 12 illustrate yet another aspect of the present invention. In Fig. 10, a reservoir assembly 57 is shown having a rigid outer case 58 within which a flexible liner 59 is disposed. In the embodiment herein shown, liner 59 is shaped to conform to the shape of case 58 when liner 59 is filled with liquid. Liner 59 is preferably formed from a heavy, high density polyethylene material, or the like, which is sturdy and liquid tight, and which allows the liquid and air tight attachment thereto of values, couplings, and the like by, for example, heat welding or other commonly known fastening techniques. Case 58 is formed with a lower case 60 to which a case lid 61 is attached at hinge 62, and a lock 63 secures lid 61 in the closed position. When opened, lid 61 allows the replacement of liner 59 when the liquid has been depleted therefrom, or when a different type of liquid must be substituted. Connectors 64, 65 and 66 are attached liquid tightly to or near the bottom of liner 59 and, in the preferred embodiment herein shown, extend through openings formed in the bottom of lower case 60 not specifically shown herein . To allow for such extension, legs 67 may be attached to the underside of power case 60. Each of the above mentioned connectors is adapted for use with some aspect of the mask delivery system heretofore described. As shown in Fig. 10, bulb connector 64 may be used to connect suction tube 30 of prior art mask 31 to reservoir assembly 57 by providing connector adaptor 68 attached to supply line 69. When thus connected, bulb siphon 70 is used to pump liquid from liner 59 to mask 31, to be ingested by the user thereof. Where a user is wearing a mask assembly such as that shown in Fig. 1, the user may connect to reservoir assembly 57 via bulb connector 64 or straight connector 65, by inserting plug 20 into connector adaptor 68 or a similar connector adaptor 71 formed on supply line 72 of straight connector 65. When a user attaches to straight connector 65, liquid is pumped from liner 59 through use of bulb 15 of mask 10. A third variation of connector is exemplified by refill connector 66, which includes a refill bulb siphon 73, a supply line 74, and a fill plug 75. Fill plug 75 is adapted to fit cap 22 of canteen assembly 40, as seen in Fig. 4. Bulb siphon 73 may then be operated to draw liquid from liner 59 and pump it into canteen 40. In Fig. 12, there is shown a user 76 positioned to refill canteen 40 via connector 66, while drinking directly via connector 65, using mask bulb siphon 77. It is contemplated that reservoir assembly 57 be permanently attached and positioned, such as to the interior or exterior of a vehicle. Where, however, it is desireable to have a portable source of liquid replacement, a construction such as that shown in Fig. 11 is contemplated. A rigid carrying case 78 is divided by a shelf 79 into upper and lower compartments 80 and 81, respectively. A liner 82, formed from similar material as that of liner 59, is disposed within upper compartment 80, and is shaped and sized to fill compartment 80 when filled with liquid. A filler cap assembly 83 may be formed as an integral part of liner 82, and, as shown, is preferably accessible outside of case 78. Lower compartment 79 accommodates a range of connectors 84 which are attached to liner 82, and attachable to masks and canteen assemblies as heretofore described. Compartments 79 and 80 are closed off by door 85, and the entire assembly may be conveniently carried by handle 86. To facilitate the refilling of canteens such as 40 of Fig. 4, means may be provided to apply pressure to the liners 59 82 of reservoir assemblies 57 78 respectively. Where such a reservoir is permanently attached, as to a vehicle, an externally mantained source of compressed air drawn from the engine motor may be applied to the interior of case, 58 to collapse liner 59 as liquid is drawn therefrom. In the absence of such a supply of compressed air, gas cartridges such as those used to store CO₂ gas may be used. Where liners 59 82 are supplied prefilled with liquid, gas may also be introduced into such liners at the time of packaging to create such additional pressure. Where no external pressure source is needed, it is contemplated that liners 59 82 will collapse by atmospheric pressure alone, as liquid is withdrawn therefrom. Case 58 is preferably vented, as at 87 of Fig. 10, and said vents 87 are preferably of the type which will close when pressure is added to the interior of case 58. Another preferred method of facilitating the refilling of canteens such as 40 involves use of an adaptor 88 such as that shown in Fig. 12, interposed between canteen 40 and plug 75. A valve 89 allows air selectively to enter canteen 40 and to be expelled from canteen 40 when displaced by liquid entering therein. A filter element 90 protects against the entry of airborne toxic agents, and it is comtempleted that filter element 90 may contain the same filter media as that used by mask 10 to protect the wearer from said toxic agents. A float valve not herein specifically shown is preferably included in said adaptor to prevent the liquid from reaching the filter element, if such protection is deemed necessary. Where a reservoir, such as 57, is located within a vehicle, it is contemplated that users thereof may hook up to reservoir 57 continuously, without unhooking. In each instance of connection to a reservoir such as 57 or 78, it is expected that proper procedures will be followed to decontaminate the connectors, plugs, etc. required for making such connections. The number and variety of connectors attached to an individual reservoir may, of course, be varied to suit anticipated conditions of use. While the foregoing has presented various embodiments of the present invention, such embodiments are exemplary only, and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention. It is expected that others will perceive variations which, while varying from the foregoing, do not depart from the scope of the invention as herein described and claimed.
