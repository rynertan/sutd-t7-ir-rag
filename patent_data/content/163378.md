# Optical information recording member.

## Abstract
An optical information recording member is disclosed comprising a thin film 17 formed on a substrate 16 . The thin film is made of TeOx a mixture of Te and TeOâ‚‚ with a small amount of Au being added. Further, a thermal diffusion layer 18 of a metal having a higher heat conductivity than the thin film may be formed on at least one side of the recording thin film 17 . In consequence, undesirable distortion of the recording bits is prevented even when an excessively large recording power is irradiated.
