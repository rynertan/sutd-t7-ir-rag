# Electrophotographic member and process for forming a latent image.

## Abstract
An electrophotographic member in which a photocon ductive layer and a protective layer are superposed in order on a conductive support. The protective layer contains at least one metallocene or a compound having at least one metallocene nucleus in its molecular structure. A process for forming a latent image using such a member is also described.
