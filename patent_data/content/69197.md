# Tambourine frame structure.

## Abstract
The tambourine comprises a frame 1 and a metal ring 3 associated thereto and effective to take over the stresses created by the tambourine membrane 2 in such a way as to prevent the frame form deforming due to additional stresses acting thereon during the playing. Thus, owing to the presence of the reinforcing metal ring 3 , there are obviated both twisting and out of round problems in the tambourine frame 1 and, in addition, the center of gravity of the tambourine is brought closer to the membrane thereby improving stability and controllability as the ball is hit.

## Description
This invention relates to a tambourine frame structure for playing with small balls and the like. To obtain an implement with good characteristics, it is known that the membrane of tambourine must be stretched on the frame with considerable force. In addition to this routine stress, the frame is also subjected to the stresses generated while practicing the game. for these reasons, the traditional wooden frame has been abandoned in favor of stronger frames of plastics, which fail, however, to satisfactorily solve the deformation problem. That deformation revealsitself both in the frame getting out of round, twisting, and breaking, especially along the opposite edge to the edge Whereon the membrane is stretched a In fact, the impact stress of the bill onto the membrane behaves as the power of a first order lever having its fulcrum located at an approximately middle region of the frame, and the resistance at the opposite edge of the membrane. In order to obviate said breaki effect, during the molding stage, undisclosed attempts have been made to embed a wire length into the stressed edge. However, this solution remained disaavantageous in that the center of gravity of the tamborine moves away the membrane, thus creating problems of unbalance upon hitting the ball. Accordingly the task of this invention is to pro vide a tambourine frame structure which can obviate the problems and deficiencies of prior ones. Within this task it is an object of the r rention to provide such a structure which is as far as possible indeformable under the stresses imposed by both the membrane tension and the playing activity. Yet another object is to provide such a structure which can be readily implemented with conventional techniques and equipment. The aforesaid task and objects as well as yet other objects which will be more apparent hereinafter, are achieved by a tambourine frame structure, comprising a substantially cylindrical frame with an outer and an inner periphery thereof and a stretched membrane extending over the area encircled by said frame and fixed on said frame, characterized by a metal ring member circumferentially coextensive with said cylindrical frame and having at least one portion thereof in stress resisting circumferential engagement with at least one longitudinal part of said cylindrical frame. Further features and advantages of the invention will be more clearly understood from the following detailed description of a preferred embodiment, given herein by way of example and not of limitation, and illustrated in the accompanying drawings, where Figure 1 is a perspective partly sectioned view illustrating a tambourine frame structure according to the shown embodiment Figure 2 is a fragmentary sectional view taken. along the line Il Il of Figure 1 Figure 3 is a sectional view through the metal ring associable to the subject tambourine frame structure and Figures 4 and 5 illustrate variations of the ring shown in Figure 3. With reference to the drawing figures, the shown tambourine frame structure comprise 5 a frame 1, of substantially cylindrical configuration, whereon a membrane 2 is stretched in a conventional known way, whereby a cylindrical flap 2 of the membrane strongly adheres against the side wall of the frame 1. More specifically the frame 1 may be conveniently formed by any suitable plastics material injection process. During assembling, a metal ring 3 is inserted between the frame and membrane,which ring is configured such that, in cross section, it comprises a lip 4 engaging with an edge thereof into a seat 1 formed on the outer periphery of the frame 1, and a rounded region 5 provided for contacting the membrane, and an inner flange formation 6. It should be noted that the cited three parts of the reinforcing ring 3 are an integral construction, and so configured as to react to stresses regardless of how applied, thus preventing both twisting and out of round problems in the tambourine frame. The rounded portion 5 of the ring 3 serves the purpose to gradually distribute the stresses acting on the membrane. In a simplified embodiment, the ring 3 may be cylindrically configured as shown in Figure 4, to only resist stresses tending to twist the frame in this case it may be advantageously embedded,in the frame and arranged in the seat 1 provided on the inner periphery of the frame 1. According to yet another variation, shown inFigure 5, the ring has a flat shape lying in a plane perpendicular to the axis of the frame 1 and arranged in the seat 1 thereby being effective to prevent the frame from getting out of round. Obviously it should also be noted that, during the frame forming operation, one or more such rings may be inserted, depending on the tambourine height and the stresses which the tambourine structure is to Withstand. In addition to the cited advantage of structural strength, with metal rings of the type illustrated, the center of gravity of the tambourine is brought closer to the membrane, with considerable attendant improvement in stability and controllability as the ball is being hit. Of course, such rings and the frame may have any desired size, and the material employed may be any selected one for the intended application.
