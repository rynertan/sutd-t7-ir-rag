# Arrangement for checking the counting function of counters.

## Abstract
A possibility to check a binary counter for proper operation is to duplicate the counter. The isochronism of the counters CNT can be checked by comparing the counting positions. If in a system two counters are, for example, required which are indeed operated isochronously but not in synchronism, for example the individual read and write counters for memory addressing purposes, both counters must be duplicated. The arrangement according to the invention has for its object to provide a simpler solution by using one counter as a duplicate of the other one instead of duplicating both counters. The parity of the counting posi tion after each increment of both counters is generated. The parity bit of the counter CNT having the highest counting position is delayed by means of a shift register SR over a number of positions corresponding to the difference in counting positions between the two counters and is then compared with the parity of the counting position of the other counter.
