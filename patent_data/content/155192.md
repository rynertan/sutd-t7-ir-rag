# CDNA CLONES CODING FOR POLYPEPTIDES EXHIBITING IGE BINDING FACTOR ACTIVITY

## Abstract
Plasmid vectors are provided that carry complementary DNA cDNA clones coding for polypeptides exhibiting mam malian IgE binding factor activity. One of these clones con tains an open reading frame consisting of 556 codons. The cDNA is derived for example from messenger RNA isolated from a rat mouse T cell hybridoma line. The cDNA can be cloned by incorporation into a pcD plasmid vector. The plas mid vector also contains DNA segments from th SV40 virus, permitting expression of the cDNA to form a polypeptide having IgE potentiating activity after transfection into a mam malian host cell, such as monkey Cos7 cells.
