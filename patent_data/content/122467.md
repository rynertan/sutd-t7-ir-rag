# Image information registering retrieving system.

## Abstract
An image information registering retrieving system comprises an optical disk 19 for registering image informa tion and for registering retrieving data, a magnetic disk 28 for storing the retrieving data, and a control circuit 11, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 27 for controlling the registering and retrieving operations. When the magnetic disk 28 loses its function and is replaced by a new one, the retrieving data on the optical disk 19 is copied on the new magnetic disk.
