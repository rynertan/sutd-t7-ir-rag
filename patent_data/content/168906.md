# PNEUMATIC SPREADER

## Abstract
A pneumatic spreader for the distribution of materials and flow distributor for same are disclosed. The spreader includes a distribution chamber 18 having multiple compartments A, B, C with a gas inlet 50 and material outlet 52 defining a venturi in each of the compartments. The materials are discharged from the distribution chamber 18 and its compartments through first conduits 56 coupled to the respective material outlets 52 and a plurality of second conduits 80 communicating with each of the first conduits for receiving the materials and discharging them to the ground. A flow distributor 82 adjacent the juncture of the first and second conduits equally divides the materials in the first conduit 56 between the second conduits 80 . The flow dis tributor includes a substantially circular plate 84 having a plurality of openings 86 which communicate to the second conduits 80 and a substantially conical deflector 88 which is adjustable linearly and is eccentrically rotatable for adjusting the flow between the plate openings 86 . In a second embodiment of flow distributor 82 , a second plate 96 is provided between the deflector 88 and the circular plate 84 and this second plate 96 also is movable linearly and is eccentrically rotatable relative to the openings to further adjust the flow through the openings 86 .
