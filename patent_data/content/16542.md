# Electrodeless discharge lamp radio frequency oscillator circuit combinations.

## Abstract
A high frequency electrodeless discharge device is oper ated by radio frequency energy generated by an oscillator operating in Class E mode. By proper selection of the oscil lator circuit components, a load network capacitor can be eliminated along with an inductor which is normally required to pass direct current to the transistor switch portion of the oscillator. The elimination of these elements permits the oscil lator to be packaged in compact fashion. The discharge device incorporates a looped core of high permeability material which forms a part of the tuned circuit output portion of the oscillator and the radio frequency energy electromagnetic fields passed through and about the core and within the envelope of the device excite a discharge sustaining medium to generate plasma which is converted to visible radiations. A feed back signal winding is also wrapped about the looped core and electrically connects to the transistor switch portion of the oscillator in order to provide feedback oscillatory energy for the Class E oscillator.
