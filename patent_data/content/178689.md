# Refractory binder and method for making it.

## Abstract
A refractory binder comprises a phosphate matrix and a tackifying agent in intimate admixture with said phosphate matrix. A method for making said binder comprises the steps of stirring a phosphate tackifying agent mixture, heating said mixture to at least approximately 37.78 C 100 F , adding hydrated alumina to said mixture, and heating said hydrated alumina phosphate tackifying agent to at least approximate ly 82.2 C. This binder may be applied for a refractory material comprising a plurality of refractory fibers and a phosphate tackifying agent mixture.
