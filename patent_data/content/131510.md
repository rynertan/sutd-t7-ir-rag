# Photographic element containing a polymeric mordant and use thereof in color image transfer.

## Abstract
A photographic element and its use in diffusion transfer photography are described which contain a novel polymeric mordant comprising recurring units having the formula CHEM wherein A represents recurring units derived from one or more an alpha , beta ethylenically unsaturated monomer B represents recurring units derived from a monomer containing at least two ethylenically unsaturated groups QN represents a moiety containing a quaternized nitrogen group R 1 represents an alkoxy group having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms or an alkylenedioxy group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, the group being appended to an aromatic group of A R 2 represents an alkoxy group having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms or an alkylenedioxy group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, the group being appended to an aromatic group of QN each n and m independently represents an integer from 0 to 5, with the proviso that the polymer contains recurring units having at least two alkoxy groups or one alkylenedioxy group each R 3 independently represents hydrogen or an alkyl group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms X represents an anion x is from 0 to 80 mole percent y is from 20 to 100 mole percent and z is from 0 to 10 mole percent.
