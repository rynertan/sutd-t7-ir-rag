# Ramped nucleation of solid state phase changes.

## Abstract
For faster processing of any solid state phase change which is rate limited by nucleation, the material tem perature is steadily and gradually increased from a first temperature, where nucleation but not significant growth occurs, up to a second higher temperature, where rapid growth occurs. Since most of the nuclei survive to grow at the higher temperature, completed growth is far more rapid ly attained than with prior art annealing processes, where a constant nucleation temperature and a constant higher growth temperature are used. In a sample embodiment, this is applied to oxygen precipitation in silicon.

## Description
RAMPED NUCLEATION OF SOLID STATE PHASE CHANGESBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a method for rapidly achieving phase transformations in solids. The present invention is applicable to increase the speed of any process in which a phase transformation in solids is rate limited by nucleation. Important examples of such processes are in oxygen precipitation in silicon and in annealing of glass ceramics. However, this invention is applicable to a great variety of other processes, since it has general applicability and is not limited by the pecular characteristics of the principal embodiments discussed below. Oxygen precipitation in Czochralski grown silicon is currently used for intrinsic gettering of heavy metals and other impurities. The oxygen is present in as grown material at concentrations on the order of 1018 per cubic centimeter, because the quartz liner used to hold the molten silicon is partially dissolved during crystal growth. The amount of oxygen which is thus incorporated into the as grown crystal is above the solubility limit for oxygen in silicon at normal integrated circuit device processing temperatures. During processing of integrated circuit devices, the supersaturated concentration of interstitial oxygen reacts with silicon to form silicon dioxide. The particles of silicon dioxide which are formed by this process generate dislocations, which serve to trap mobile impurities. The process whereby interstitial oxygen reacts to form silicon dioxide particles takes place in two steps nucleation and growth. During nucleation, the number of precipitate particles i.e. SiO2 is increasing, and the total amount of silicon dioxide per unit volume is also increasing. During the growth stage, the number of precipitation locations remains constant, while the volume concentration of silicon dioxide is still increasing. A third stage coarsening can also occur, wherein the number of particles precipitate locations is decreasing, while the volume concentration of silicon dioxide remains constant and equal to the thermal equilibrium concentration. In many processes, such as solid state phase transformations in metals, nucleation and growth occur simultaneously.However, for oxygen in silicon, the nucleation and growth can be separated into separate temperature regimes and hence independently controlled.There exists a large body of literature dealing with these phenomena. For example, see U.S. Patent No. 4,314,595 toYamamoto. All of these citations are hereby incorporated by reference. In prior art processes, the wafer is held at a first temperature, such as 600 C, at which nucleation of silicon dioxide precipitates occurs. After time enough for substantial nucleation to occur, the wafer is heated to a second temperature, where rapid growth can occur, such as 1000or. However, in such a two step process, a large fraction of the nuclei initially generated will dissolve when the wafer is heated to the higher temperature. The surface to volume ratio becomes high for very small particles, and thus the interface energy dominates for small particles, which is why particles below a certain temperature dependent critical size tend to dissolve. Thus, growth at the higher temperature actually occurs on a relatively small number of particles, and complete growth to equilibrium is therefore slow.Typically, a total annealing time of eight or ten hours may be required in such a prior art process. A further effect of the long growth time required by the precipitation methods of the prior art is that large crystallites of silicon dioxide will be grown from the relatively few surviving nuclei. However, excessively large precipitated particles are believed not to be optimal, since the localized lattice distortion imposed is greater than that required to trap impurities, and since the average density of impurity traps lattice distortion sites is lower. Another area of art where two plateau annealing has conventionally been used is in glass ceramic materials. In such materials, nucleation is typically performed at a first holding temperature, and the material is then heated, as fast is permitted by thermal shock, to a second temperature at which growth on the surviving nuclei occurs. However, a large fraction of the nuclei formed at the nucleation temperature will have an excessively smaller size at the higher growth temperature, and will therefore be redissolved. Thus, growth takes place on a smaller number of nuclei than was originally formed. This is undesirable in this art, since it is highly desirable that the crystals formed in glass ceramic processing be small and uniform in size. In the prior art of glass ceramic processing, the necessary large number of nuclei at the growth temperature is often achieved adding a high concentration e.g. 5 of a nucleating agent, such as titanium dioxide, zirconium dioxide, phosphorus pentoxide, heavy metals, or fluorides.However, such large concentrations of a nucleating agent may themselves be deleterious to the desired mechanical properties of the resulting material. Thus it is an object of the present invention to provide a method for copiously nucleated growth of a second phase in solid state phase changes, without adding large amounts of heterogeneous nucleating agents. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a general method for precipitating supersaturated impurities in crystalline semiconductors. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a method for rapidly nucleating and growing a second phase in a solid state phase change process. Thus, it is an object of the present invention to provide a faster process for precipitating dissolved oxygen in silicon to achieve equilibrium. Thus, it is an object of the present invention to provide a method for precipitating silicon dioxide from solid silicon at many sites. It is a further object of the present invention to provide silicon wafers, having silicon dixoide particles of average size less than 50 nm at many sites. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention modifies the temperature treatment used to precipitate silicon dioxide inCzochralski grown silicon. In place of a two plateau temperature cycle, a steadily increasing temperature ramping step is used to raise the temperature of the wafer from the nucleation range up into the growth range.The result of this is that most of the nuclei which are precipitated at the lower temperature gradually grow as the temperature is raised, so that a great many growth centers survive into the growth temperature range. By contrast, in the prior art, most of the precipitated nuclei are dissolved when the temperature is raised into the growth range. According to the present invention, there is provided a method for rapidly inducing a solid state material to change from a first phase to a second phase, comprising the steps of heating said material to a first temperature at which rapid nucleation of said second phase occurs within the matrix of said first phase ramping the temperature of said material steadily up to a second temperature, where rapid growth of said second phase occurs, said ramping step being performed gradually and continuously whereby particles of said second phase which are nucleated at and near said first temperature are continuously grown during said ramping step, to provide large particles of said second phase.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS For homogeneous nucleation, the phase transformation is driven by a reduction in free energy given by AG AGV a E, where AG is the total energy change, GV is the change in volume free energy, usually 0 for the reaction to occur, o is the interfacial energy between the matrix, a, and ss and E is a strain energy term. a and E are 0. For simplicity, ignore E which can be treated as a change in A Gv. Then for a spherical particle butEMI7.1 where A EV enthalpy volumetric change, T temperature and TE transformation temperature, which in this case is the temperature at which all the oxygen in the crystal is in solution, which is close to the melting point of the silicon. Since A E and 0, there is some r where AG 0. If one plots the variables of interest, as in Fig. 1, r is the radius above which AG monotonically decreases with increasing r. It is the r such thatdt G o. One dr finds that EMI7.2 the value of AG at r AG isEMI7.3 hence both r and G are functions, as sketched in Fig.2. The nucleation rate, J, is proportional to the number of nuclei that are stable and the ability of atoms to reach this nucleus. So J a exp AG kt exp ED kt where E D is the activation energy for diffusion. The nucleation rate thus varies with temperature as shown inFig. 3 because the nucleation rate is constantly increasing while diffusion is decreasing as T is lowered. The basic principles of the new ramping technique may now be discussed and compared to isothermal processing.During an isothermal process for nucleation, say at 600 750or, embryos, i.e. particles with r r , are constantly forming. Since the distribution is proportional to AG in an Arrhenius relationship, N r a exp AG kt as shown in Fig. 4. For r r , the particles can grow limited only by kinetics. The particle size distribution as a function of time at constant temperature can be plotted as shown inFig. 5. Thus after any given time, there is basically an exponentially decaying with size distribution of particles. This is the whole purpose of the nucleation anneal. The effect of the growth step is to cause the previously formed particles to grow. Not all the t3 embryos grow at high temperature. Only those with r r at the higher temperature survive.For example, assume that after a nucleation anneal at 700oC, the size distribution is as shown in Rig. 6. The critical size at 7000C is indicated by rl . The critical size at the growth temperature, e.g. 1000or, is shown in Fig. 7 by r . Refer also to Fig. 2. Only those particles larger than r2 will grow the others will shrink. Nucleation of new particles at the growth temperature is small it can be neglected. The particle size distribution after growth is shown by the rightmost curve in Fig. 7. Classical isothermal nucleation is thus concerned with growing embryos at the low temperature so that some small fraction of them survive the high temperature. These explanations have been published by Kishino in J. Phys. Soc. Japan, 49 1980 Suppl. A, pp. 49 56.The actual particles of interest may be in a somewhat different distribution. The ramping technique of the present invention eliminates the discontinuity in the value of r by smoothly varying the temperature and therefore r as well. The sample is placed in a furnace at a very low temperature, e.g. 425or or less. The anneal temperature is thenincreased gradually to the growth temperature, e.g. 1000of. A first embodiment of the invention has been demonstrated using many 2 5 0C step c h a n g e s, to avoid the need for programmable temperature controllers ona readily available laboratory furnace. The behavior of r and T with time are sketched in Fig. 8.The particle size distribution also varies smoothly with respect to time when the temperature is ramped. The change in r per step is relatively small, so the number of particles which do not grow, but dissolve is small as well. The differences in the size distribution due to ramping compared to isothermal annealing can be quite dramatic, as shown inFigure 10. Some sample x ray topography results, obtained from comparative samples showing the result of the present invention, are shown in Table 1.

In an alternative embodiment of the invention, the ramping is not performed at a constant rate. That is, additional economies of time are achieved by using a faster average ramping rate over the temperature range where neucleation has mostly been completed, and using the slowest ramping rate in the low temperature range where neucleation is still critical. That is, in a sample of this embodiment of the invention, the starting temperature for the ramp is 4O00C. The temperature is initially increased at a rate of 800C per hour, and the rate of temperature increase is itself steadily increased, until, at 1000or where the ramping step is terminated, the rate of increase is 200or per hour. That is, a second order curve is used to control the ramping.Of course, other nonlinear curves may be used. This modification provides slightly greater economies of time than the principal embodiment previously discussed. Thus, the present invention provides the key advantage of shorter annealing times required to precipitate dissolved oxygen in silicon and silicon dioxide. The present invention also provides the advantage that, after precipitation of dissolved oxygen and silicon dioxide according to the present invention, the density of silicon dioxide particles in the silicon is higher than with prior art methods. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the present invention provides a basic innovation in silicon processing which can be used in a great variety of integrated circuit fabrication processes and which can be widely modified. The present invention is not limited except as claimed below. The present invention advantageously provides silicon integrated circuit material incorporating silicon dioxide particles of small and uniform size. The present invention provides the further advantage of a rapid process for oxygen precipitation in silicon. Thus, the present invention is applicable not only to such processes as precipitation of oxygen and silicon, but is also applicable to other precipitation processes where the nucleation is a rate limiting step. For example, it is also applicable to precipitation of other dissolved impurities in silicon or other semiconductors. It is also applicable to growth of crystalline domains in a glassy matrix, or to other solid state phase change processes. Thus the present invention provides the advantage of providing a method for copiously nucleated growth of a second phase in solid state phase changes, without adding large amounts of heterogenous nucleating agents. The present invention further provides the advantage of providing a general method for precipitating supersaturated impurities in crystalline semiconductors. The present invention further provides the advantage of providing a method for rapidly nucleating and growing a second phase in a solid state phase change process. It will be obvious to those skilled in the art that the present invention provides a fundamental innovation in materials processing. It is applicable to a wide variety of processes, whether heterogenously or homogeneously nucleated, as long as the process is thermally activated.Thus, the scope of the present invention is not limited except as in the appended claims.
