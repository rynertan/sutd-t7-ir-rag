# METHOD FOR MAKING A DRY PLANOGRAPHIC PRINTING PLATE

## Abstract
A method for making a dry planographic printing plate, which comprises exposing through a negative transparency a dry negative working presensitized plate comprising a base substrate having provided thereon, in order, a photosensi tive layer containing an orthoquinonediazide compound and a silicone rubber layer developing the exposed plate exposing the developed plate to light so as to make its exposure value not less than 5 of the exposure value at the time of the exposure through the negative transparency and then treating the exposed plate with a basic compound.
