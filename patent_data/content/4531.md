# Method of compression molding.

## Abstract
Mechanical properties of compression molded composites having thick sections and made from molding compounds comprising thermosetting resin and reinforcing fiber in a thickened dispersion are improved by a preheating stage and mold cycle times that are longer than the time necessary to reach the highest peak exotherm temperature of the composite during molding. Slow post cooling allows for development of properties especially when mold opening times are shorter than that required for removal of all thermal gradients.
