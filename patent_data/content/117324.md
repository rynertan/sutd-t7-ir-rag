# Metal extraction from solution and immobilized chelating agents used therefor.

## Abstract
What is disclosed are novel metal chelating agents which are bonded to inorganic substrates to immobilize them. An example of such a metal chelating agent is CH₃O ₃Si CH₂ ₃NH CH₂CH₂NH ₂ CH₂ ₃Si OCH₃ . An example of an inorganic substrate is a silica gel.
