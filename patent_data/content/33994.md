## Abstract
A method of checking the authenticity of papers, such as banknotes, is provided which comprises using authentic paper containing a minor amount of substance showing an ESR spectrum at room temperature and checking the authenticity by ESR spectroscopy, as well as paper for use in said method, containing a minor amount of a compound showing an ESR spectrum at room temperature, said compound being either an oxide or salt having a crystal lattice of cubic symmetry doped with such a metal, or an oxide or salt of arbitrary symmetry doped with a freely rotatable ion containing such a metal.
