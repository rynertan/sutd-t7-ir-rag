# Bilateral fenestrated drape.

## Abstract
A bilateral fenestrated drape folded in such a manner to eliminate the need for removable paper coverings over the fenestrations. The drape is fan folded in the longitudinal di rection and then fan folded transversely to form two stacks of the folds with a bridging or central portion between the stacks. The bridging portion is folded to form flaps which are used to cover the fenestrations.
