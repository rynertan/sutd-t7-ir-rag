# Isocyanate coupled reinforced oxymethylene polymers.

## Abstract
An improved moulding composition is provided compris ing an oxymethylene polymer, a blocked or unblocked isocya nate compound in an amount of 0.2 to 2.0 percent of the weight of the polymer, a filler and an isocyanate active cata lyst. Shaped articles produced from the composition exhibit desirable mechanical properties without the need for fibrous reinforcing agents.
