# Balloon tube for treating oesophageal varices.

## Abstract
A balloon tube for treating oesophageal varices has a balloon 3 and inflation lumen 2 to close the oesophagus, and a suction lumen 1 having distal openings 5 to remove air and body fluids. Additional suction openings 5 min may be provided proximal of the balloon 3 to suck in saliva and like fluids collecting in the gullet. The distal end of the tube may carry a soft outer covering tube 6 to prevent damage to the oesophagus or stomach. A stomach balloon 7 may be provided distally of the oesophagus balloon to provide positive blood checking in cases where blood loss is great.
