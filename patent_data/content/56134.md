# DC to AC inverter.

## Abstract
A dc to ac inverter employing a control low power section and a power section. The low power section comprises a square wave generator, cross coupled NOR latches and low level transistor switches for providing switching current to the power section. The power section employs complementary FET drivers and power switches connected to a battery or other source of dc and a ferro resonant transformer for changing dc to ac. The power section is protected by a voltage sensor. In a preferred embodiment, this voltage is proportional to the current through the respective power switches and is used to unlatch the applicable NOR latch, thereby causing shut off of the protected network of the power section. The control section is also protected by normal unlatching of the NOR latches after a normal square wave voltage half cycle. A switch is also provided in the control section for permitting the square wave generator and NOR latches to be supplied with regulated voltage, while removing such voltage from the low level transistor switches. A preferred packaging arrangement for an inverter system providing power to a large system is to package the low power or control components separately and the high power for one load segment in a separate module. Subsequent high power modules are conveniently driven by the same low power or control module since the FET drivers are such high gain power drivers, they require little power and are readily connectable in parallel.
