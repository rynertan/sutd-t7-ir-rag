# INFORMATION HOLDING DEVICE INFORMATION HOLDING DEVICE

## Abstract
A memory for carrying information comprises a multi layer film 1 having a plurality of monomolecular layers 2 , in which each layer is capable of carrying a charge. Charges are introduced into one side of the film 1 in a time sequence which corresponds to the information to be carried. A voltage is applied between the faces of the film 1 to cause the charge carried by any layer 2 to be transferred to the adjacent layer 2 . The sequence of charges carried by the film can be read out. The charges are introduced by electrodes 7, 7 adjacent opposite faces of the film which apply across the film voltage pulses of an amplitude greater than that required to cause tunnelling without thermal activation between the layers of the film and at least equal to that required to cause electrons to tunnel without thermal activation from one of the electrodes to the film layer adjacent thereto.
