# LIGHTWEIGHT, WELDED ALUMINIUM SHORING FRAME

## Abstract
A vertical load supporting frame comprises a pair of spaced vertical tubular legs and interconnecting brace arrangement welded to the legs. The spaced legs have opposing areas to which the brace arrangement is welded. The opposing areas of the spaced legs are adapted to control the degree to which heat of welding affects the structural integrity of each leg, so as to substantially retain vertical load supporting capacity in each welded leg of the frame. Such load supporting frames are particularly useful in the concrete forming field.
