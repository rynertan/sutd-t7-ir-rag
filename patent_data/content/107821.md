# Method of producing a silicon carbide body.

## Abstract
A sintered silicon carbide body having a high thermal conductivity and a high electrical insulation without any drop substantially throughout the sintered body is produced from a powdery silicon carbide composition comprising at least 90 by weight of silicon carbide powders having an average particle size of not more than 10 µm and 0.01 to 4 by weight of powders of beryllium or its compound having a particle size of not more than 30 µm in terms of beryllium atom, a nitrogen content of the composition being not more than 500 ppm.
