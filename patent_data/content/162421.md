# Chemically treated glass fibers and strands and dispersed products thereof.

## Abstract
Treated glass fibers having improved utilization of silane coupling agents are produced which have good strand han dling and processing properties and which result in rein forced polymeric materials having good strength properties and good UV color stability. The treated glass fibers having an aqueous treating composition present on a substantial portion of the surface of the glass fibers, wherein the aqueous chemical treating composition has an aqueous dispersion of an internally silylated polyurethane polymer having silicon ate anions and one or more dispersing agents in at least an effective dispersing amount, and water in an amount to give a total solids for the aqueous chemical composition for treat ment of the glass fibers. The one or more dispersing agents, can be present as external dispersing agentes in which case their amounts could be both aneffective dispersing amount and an effective lubricating mount. In addition, the dispers ing agents can be present with the internally silylated polyu rethane polymer as an internal hydrophilic additive like nonionic and or ionic and or ionic precursor dispersing agents. In this case, the aqueous chemical treating compo sition has a glass fiber lubricant present in an effective lu bricating amount. The internally silylated polyurethane may also have internal hardening segments to provide hardness to the polyurethane film formed on the glass fibers. The treated glass fibers can be used in reinforcing thermoplastic and thermosetting polymeric materials in various forms of continuous glass fibers and strand and chopped glass fibers and strands and mats of glass fibers and strands.
