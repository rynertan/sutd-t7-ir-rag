# Radiographic apparatus and method with automatic exposure control.

## Abstract
A radiographic apparatus are disclosed for producing an x ray shadowgraph of a patient for display on a video monitor. The apparatus includes an x ray source A for irradiating the patient and an image intensifier B for receiving the radiation which has traversed the patient. The image intensifier pro duces an optical image of the shadowgraphic projection of the radiation through the patient. A television camera C is opti cally connected with the image intensifier B to convert the optical image into a video signal. An image processor 32 is provided for storing and enhancing the video signals from the television camera C to produce various images on the televi sion minitor E . An automatic exposure control F is provided for determining the duration which the x ray tube 10 should be operated for properly exposing one x ray shadowgraphic image of the patient. The exposure control includes a photo electric transducer 48 which is optically coupled 40, 42, 44, 46 with the image intensifier B to produce a signal which is indicative of the average intensity of the optical image. An integrator 56 integrates the intensity signal to produce a signal which is indicative of the total light exposure. When the exposure signal reaches a predetermined level, a timer 14 which was started as the x ray source started emitting radia tion is stopped. The time indicated on the timer 60 indicates the duration which the x ray source should be operated to produce and properly expose one shadowgraphic image.
