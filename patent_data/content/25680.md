# Auto zero amplifier circuit.

## Abstract
An operational amplifier 33 is continuously switched back and forth between an auto zero mode of operation and an accurate amplification mode of operation. During the auto zero mode of operation, the junction between an offset voltage compensation eg., auto zero capacitor 35 and the nonin verting input of the operational amplifier 33 is referenced to the input signal voltage via a bootstrap amplifier 31 , rather than being tied to ground. Further, during the auto zero mode of operation, the other end of the auto zero capacitor 35 is referenced to the output of the operational amplifier 33 , which is also connected to the inverting input of the operation amplifier. As a result, the auto zero capacitor 35 is charged to a voltage level equal to the input offset voltage of the opera tional amplifier, but in polarity opposition thereto. During the accurate amplification mode of operation, the input signal is applied to the noninverting input of the operational amplifier 33 via the auto zero capacitor 35 . As a result, the charge on the auto zero capacitor cancels the input offset voltage of the amplifier whereby the output of the operational amplifier 33 is accurately related to the voltage of the input signal by the gain of the operational amplifier. Because the auto zero capacitor 35 is referenced to the input signal voltage during the auto zero mode of operation, rather than being tied to ground, volt age swings at the output of the operational amplifier 33 and across the various switch elements 37, 39, 41 are kept low. As a result, the auto zero amplifier circuit is operable over a wide dynamic range.
