# Electrode for electrolysis.

## Abstract
An anode comprising an electroconductive substrate provided with a Ru Sn Oâ‚‚ solid solution coating is useful in brine electrolysis. The improved coating has a composition of i 3 to 45 mol of ruthenium oxide, ii 0.1 to 30 mol of at least one member selected from metallic platinum, platinum oxide, and iridium oxide, and iii 50 to 96.9 mol of tin oxide which may be partially replaced by antimony.
