# Method for the production of phenylalanine ammonia lyase by fermentation.

## Abstract
A process for producing phenylalanine ammonia lyase which comprises cultivating a phenylalanine ammonia lyase producing microorganism under aerobic growth promoting conditions inducing said microorganism to make phenyl alanine ammonia lyase under phenylalanine ammonia lyase producing conditions and subjecting the resulting fermentation medium to substantially anaerobic static conditions so as to improve the stability and useful life of the enzyme.
