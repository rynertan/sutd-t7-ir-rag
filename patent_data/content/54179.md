# Flexible coupling with quadrilateral flex frames.

## Abstract
A flexible coupling 20 for drivingly connecting driving 22 and driven members 26 and for accommodating both angular and endwise misalignment of such members com prises a plurality of quadrilateral flex frames 36 arranged face to face along the central axis of the coupling 28 . The two end frames are connected respectively to the driving and driven members through opposite corner portions 40 of each such frame 36 . Among the flex frames themselves, each frame is connected to the next adjacent frame by having two of its opposite corner portions 40 rigidly connected to two opposite corner portions 40 of the adjacent frame 36 . The joint between each pair of con nected corner portions is of an improved construction which maximizes the flexing length of the flex frame legs and otherwise provides benefits resulting in the coupling having improved performance and reliability, particularly with re gard to applications requiring the transmission of high levels of torque at high rotational speeds and with possibly high amounts of angular and endwise misalignment.
