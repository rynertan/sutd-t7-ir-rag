# Process for forming passivation film on photoelectric conversion device and the device produced thereby.

## Abstract
In a process for producing a photoelectric conversion device 1 having a junction between hydrogenated amor phous silicon 4 and an electrode made of ITO 5 or the like, on the surface of which a passivation film 6 made of silicon oxide is provided, the passivation film made of silicon oxide is formed in accordance with the plasma CVD method in an atmosphere of mixed gas prepared by admixing excessively a gas containing oxygen such as nitrous oxide gas, carbon dioxide gas, oxygen gas or the like with silane gas. A photoelectric conversion device 1 , the surface of said photoelectric conversion device being covered with a silicon oxide film 6 formed in accordance with plasma CVD method in an atmosphere of mixed gas consisting of silane gas and an excessive gas containing oxygen.
