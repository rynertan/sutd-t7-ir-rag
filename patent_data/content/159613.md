# Device of conveying a stimulable phosphor sheet.

## Abstract
A stimulable phosphor sheet comprising a support, a phosphor layer containing a stimulable phosphor and a binder, and a protective film superposed in this order, which is charac terized in that at least both sides of the phosphor layer along the direction to be conveyed are retracted from the corre sponding side edges of the support, and both of said side edges of the phosphor layer and support are protected by a polymer coating layer, a polymer film, or a solid material. A method of conveying a stimulable phosphor sheet comprising applying a driving force to a surface of the stimulable phosphor sheet by means of a driving member, keeping both sides of said phosphor sheet by means of a guiding member to move the stimulable phosphor sheet in a given direction is disclosed.
