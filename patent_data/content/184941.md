# PHOTOSENSITIVE MATERIALS

## Abstract
Photosensitive materials are described comprising a carri er sheet having thereon a photosensitive layer and comprising a layer which becomes vesicular and remains cohesive under the influence of actinic radiation. When the photosensitive material is imagewise exposed to actinic radiation the pho tosensitive material becomes preferentially removable from the carrier sheet in the non exposed or the exposed areas and the vesicle forming layer material becomes vesicular. Thus there is obtained an image which is immediately visible after the image wise exposure step and accordingly can be used to check that exposure has correctly taken place and which is subsequently developable by removal of the non exposed or exposed area material. The photosensitive material according to this invention is particularly useful in the production of sign making materials and in the production of dry transfer materials using peel apart development.
