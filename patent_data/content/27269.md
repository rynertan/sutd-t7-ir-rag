# Multilamp photoflash unit with protection against electrostatic charges.

## Abstract
A photoflash unit 10 comprising a linear array of flash lamps 11 13 and 14 16 mounted on a printed circuit board 18 disposed within the longitudinal channel 30 of an elon gated housing member 26 having an enclosing cover panel 28 of light transmitting material. The lamp firing circuitry includes a common circuit conductor run 24 connected to one lead in wire of each of the lamps. The housing member includes reflector cavities 11 , 11 , etc. adjacent to the lamps, and a continuous coating of electrically conductive reflective material 42 covers the surfaces of the channel and reflector cavities for providing both reflective surfaces for flashing lamps and, by virtue of a connection between the common run and conductive coating, a shield to reduce the likelihood of accidental flashing of lamps by electrostatic charges. Additional protection against electrostatic charges is provided by a plurality of tapered holes 83 in the wall of the housing channel through which the continuous conductive coating extends to the exterior surface of the housing, thereby extending electrical ground to the exterior of the unit.
