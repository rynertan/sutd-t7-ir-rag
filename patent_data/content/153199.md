## Description
DESCRIPTION RECOVERABLE POLYETHYLENE COMPOSITION AND ARTICLE This invention relates to the field of recoverable polymeric compositions and more particularly relates to the field of recoverable polyethylenes. Of the commercially available polyethylenes, there is increasing interest in a special class of these poly mers knwon as ultra high molecular weight polyethylenes. Ultra high molecular weight polyethylenes, or UHMWPE, are generally considered to have a molecular weight in excess of 3 million. A molecular weight of 3 million or more can be defined according toASTM D 4020 81, wherein the relative viscosity should be 2.3 or more. The interest in UHMWPE results from their superiority with respect to mechanical and impact properties and abrasion and chemical resistance when compared to conventional polyethylenes. Certain of the polyethylenes may be imparted with shape memory. Crosslinking, either by chemical curing or by radiation, improves the shape memory of the polyethylenes. Work on very high molecular weight polyethy lenes has been previously disclosed in BritishPatent Specification 1,095,772. In this reference, polyethy lenes having a molecular weight in excess of 1 million were crosslinked and compared against noncrosslinked polyethylenes of similar molecular weight.Certain mechanical properties of both groups of polyethylenes were measured at temperatures above their respective melting points. A true measure of the effectiveness of shape memory is the recovery force. Recovery force can be charac terized by stress relaxation behavior as determined by a stress relaxation test. In this test, a sample is stretched at constant strain rate to a particular length and then with the strain rate set at zero, the stress as a function of time is measured. It is desirable to have a recoverable material with a higher recovery force as a function of time than is currently recognized or available. The British reference failed to appreciate the value of recovery force and, further, considered only very high molecular weight polyethylenes rather than ultra high molecularweight polyethylenes. Thus, it is an object of this invention to have a recoverable polyethylene having a high recovery force. It is another object of this invention to have a recoverable polyethylene having a high recovery force which is suitable for use as an engineering material. A first aspect of the invention provides a recoverable composition comprising crosslinked polyethylene having a molecular weight greater than about 3.3 million. A second aspect of the present invention provides a recoverable article made from this composition. As examples, the recoverable article of the present invention may be a tubular coupling having an inside diameter or a shrink ring having an insIde diameter.The cross linking of the polyethylene may be accomplished by any of the known methods such as by radIation or by chemical curing. The preferred crosslinking method is by radiation. Embodiments of the present invention ill now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein Figure 1 illustrates stress relaxation curves for the polyethylene of the present invention in the unbeamed non irradiated condition Figure 2 illustrates stress relaxation curves for the polyethylene of the present invention in the beamed condition Figure 3 illustrates the stress relaxation curves of Figure 2 on a larger time scale and Figure 4 is similar to figure 2 but illustrates another aspect of the invention. Referring to the drawings, Figure 1 illustrates stress relaxation curves for various polyethylenes ranging in molecular weight from .6 million to 5.0 million. Polyethylene tensile specimens in the unbeamed state were cut out of a UHMWPE sheet. The tensile specimens were subjected to tensile tests on anInstron with the crosshead speed set at 12.7 cm 5 inches per minute. When the crossheads moved from a separation distance of 3.0 cm 1.2 inches to 10.7 cm 4.2 inches , so that a 2.5 cm 1 inch length on the tensile speciman became 8.9 cm 3.5 inches , the strain rate of the Instron was set at zero. Then the stress as a function of time was measured and plotted. The tests were conducted at a temperature of 1200 C.As illustrated in the figure, most of the specimens are grouped together in the same range, the exception being the .6 million molecular weight specimen which stands off by itself. Similar specimens were prepared but were subjected to irradiation so as to become crosslinked. The results of the testing of these specimens are shown in Figs. 2 and 3. Once the specimens have been beamed, it is clear that the polyethy lenes can now be grouped into two distinct categories those polyethylenes less than about 1.5 million in molecular weight and those polyethylenes greater than about 3.0 million in molecular weight. This large disparity between the two groups of polyethylenes was totally surprising and unexpected. Further, the gap cannot be accounted for solely by the differences in molecular weight of the material. Stress relaxation is an important parameter for these polyethylenes because it is directly indicative of the recovery force of this material. The higher the stress at any given time, then the higher the recovery force. The higher recovery force of this material makes it suitable for uses which were heretofore unknown in the prior art. The preferable recovery force may be defined more particularly with reference to Figure 4. Figure 4 is similar to Figure 2 except that Figure 4 now includes two straight lines A and B. Lines A and B approximate the preferred ranges of the recovery force over the times of 0.1 to 30 minutes and at a temperature of 1200C. Line A may be defined by the equation Recovery Force 1750 275.log t where the recovery force is the stress psi at any unit of time and t is the time in minutes. Line A actually describes the lower limit of one preferred range of recovery force. Thus it is preferred that at any unit of time and at 1200C., the recovery force should be above line A. Line B may be defined by the equation Recovery Force 2474 275 log t where, again, the recovery force is the stress psi at any unit of time and t is the time in minutes. LineB, however, describes the more preferred range of recovery force. It is most preferred that at any unit of time and at 120O C., the recovery force should be above line B. It is also preferred that the composition and articles of these inventions be recovered by an external heat source. The heat source may either be in the form of an intense source such as a torch or in a more general form such as oven heating. In any case, an evenly distributed heat flux which does not over heat the surface is needed in order to assure a high quality product. It is preferable that the heat recoverable composition be expanded at or below the melting point of the composition. More preferably, the composition shou ld be expanded within the temperature range of room temperature to about 1400C. The melting point of these polyethylenes is actually a melting range which extends from about 13O0C 1400C. 1400C is considered to be the upper end of the temperature range at which the material will be at least partially crystalline. Even more preferably, the composition should be expanded within a temperature range of room temperature to 1250C. It has been found that the lower the temperature at which expansion occurs, the higher will be the recovery force. The lower end of the temperature range at which expansion can occur will be limited only by the force available to expand the composition. It can be appreciated that the lower the expansion temperature, the stronger will be the forces resisting expansion. When the material is expanded part of these forces resisting expansion become the driving force for recovery. At the same time, stress relaxation tends to deplete this driving force. However, since stress relaxation decreases with decreasing temperature, the effect of stress relaxation will likewise decrease with decreasing temperature. Thus, since at lower temperatures stress relaxation is at a minimum, the net driving force, i.e., the recovery force, will approach a maximum at low temperatures. It is preferable that the composition be recovered within the temperature range of room temperature to 140to. More preferably, the composition should be recovered within the temperature range of 750C to 120 C. The objects of the invention can best be achieved when the following precepts are followed The composition is preferably recovered at a temperature such that the temperature at recovery is always greater than the temperature at expansion. Also the temperature at recovery is preferably at or less than the melting point of the material When these precepts are adhered to, it is found that the recovery force is at a maximum. It can thus be seen that the instant invention diverges completely from the teaching of the aforementioned British reference where the temperatures of expansion and recovery were above the melting point of the material and the tempera ture of expansion is greater than the temperature of recovery. Embodiments of the present invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the following examples. Example 1 The composition of the present invention was prepared in the following manner The resin Hostalen GUR 413, the ultra highmolecular weight polyethylene powder, was blended with antioxidants in a high speed dry blender for about ten minutes. This compound was then loaded into a cylindrical sleeve mold. The compound was compacted in the mold in order to reduce its porosity. TheCompaction pressure was 100kgf cm2 at room temperature for about five minutes. The compacted product was sintered under ambient air at 22O0C. for thirty minutes.The applied pressure during sintering was S0kgf cm2. Subsequent to sintering, the product was cooled in the mold under pressure at 300 kgf cm2to about 500C., at which temperature the mold was opened and the product released. The size of the cylindrical sleeve was two inches in length with a 0.7 inch inside diameter and a 1.4 inch outside diameter. The product was crosslinked by exposing it to a high energy electron beam. Dosage was in the order of 6 megarads. The cylindrical sleeve was then expanded at 800C by a conical mandrel. After expansion, the inside diameter of the cylindrical sleeve was 6.35 cm 2.5 inches . The expansion ratio was 3.57X. The expansion ratio is the ratio of the inside diameter after expansion to the inside diameter before expansion.Subsequent to the expansion, the cylindrical sleeve was stored until ready for use. Two pipes having 3.8 cm 1.5 inch outside diameter were then inserted in either end of the cylindrical sleeve so that the cylindrical sleeve would form a coupling. The whole assembly was inserted in an oven and shrunk at 12O0C. Of course, after shrinking, the inside diameter of the cylindrical sleeve was 3.8 cm 1.5 inch the same as the outside diameter of the pipes. The recovery of the polyethylene around the pipes was so secure that the pipes could not be twisted in relation to the coupling. A seal which was gas tight at 827 KPa 120 psi was achieved.Example 2 A second cylindrical sleeve was made according toExample 1. In this case, however, after it had been expanded, the sleeve was sliced into several rings with each ring having a length of about 0.6 cm one quarter inch . These rings would now be used as shrink rings.In this case, a rubber sleeve was placed over an electrical connector and then the shrink ring was placed over the rubber sleeve and shrunk at 1200C in an oven. When the shrink ring was shrunk, it provided a water tight seal so that water was prevented from entering between the rubber sleeve and the electrical connector. Example 3 A third cylindrical sleeve was made according toExample 1. This sleeve was sliced into sections of about 2.54 cm 1 inch in length. This 2.54 cm 1 inch section was then recovered upon a substrate whIch would then be used as a bearing means. The bearing means would have a bearing surface. In this case, the outer periphery of the bearing means represents the bearing surface and the recovered polyethylene forms at least a portion of this bearing surface. It has been found that this bearing means may be used as a rotatable article. Due to the high recovery force of the crosslinked polyethylene of this invention, there is no possibility of slippage between the recovered polyethylene and the substrate. Recoverable articles employing the composition of this invention may be expanded up to about ten times its original inside diameter, although expansion up to eight times its original diameter is much preferred.Modifications may be made within the scope of the claims.
