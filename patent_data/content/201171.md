# Conductive polymer based PTC devices.

## Abstract
Circuit protection devices which contain PTC conduc tive polymer elements and which are used in situations in which the device is mounted onto, or itself comprises, a rig id wall which is spaced apart from the PTC element and through which the electrodes pass. The behavior of the de vice can be adversely affected if the electrodes, which are prevented from moving by the rigid wall, prevent the PTC element from expanding to the extent necessary to provide the desired PTC effect. The invention includes the use of specially designed electrodes or any other novel means which lessens the danger that the PTC element, when it is tripped, is prevented from expanding to the extent neces sary for effective operation. A typical device is shown in figure 5, in which each of the electrodes comprises a strand ed wire portion adjacent the PTC element and a solid wire portion remote from the PTC element.
