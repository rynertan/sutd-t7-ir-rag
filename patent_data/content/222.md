# Method and apparatus for continuously forming an airlaid web.

## Abstract
A continuous in line method for forming an airlaid fibrous fluff web adjacent the uppermost and lowermost surfaces of a substantially planar internal reinforcing ply having substantially the same width as said fibrous web, said ply being substantially impervious to the passage of fibers from one surface thereof to the other, in a continuous fiber deposition zone is disclosed. In a preferred embodiment, a unique tissue folding board is employed to permit continuous formation of an airfelt web having a wet strength tissue reinforcing member located approximately mid way between its uppermost and lowermost surfaces. In the apparatus for forming the web, two adjacent vacuum chambers 26,27 are preferably employed in the continuous forming zone to compensate for the increased airflow restriction encountered when forming the uppermost fibrous web position over the reinforcing ply and the lowermost fibrous web portion. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the portion of the internal ply 20 relative to the uppermost and lowermost surfaces of the resultant pad may be adjusted by advancing or retarding the position of the folding board 1 within the fiber deposition zone 12 .
