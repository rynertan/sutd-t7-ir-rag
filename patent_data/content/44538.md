# Endoscope apparatus.

## Abstract
An endoscope apparatus, wherein a microwave irra diator 56 is provided in an endoscope distal end portion 34 . The microwave irradiator 56 includes a pole type antenna 58 and a parabolic reflector 60 which surrounds the antenna 58 and has a parabolic plane. The antenna 58 is directly connected to one end of a microwave transmitting wire 66 , the other end of the microwave transmitting wire 66 is connected to a microwave oscillator 72 of a microwave generating device 38 by means of a connector 22 . When the endoscope distal end portion 34 is inserted into a coeliac cavity of a patient, medical treatment micro waves having a prescribed radiation energy is conducted to the microwave irradiator 56 through the microwave transmitting wire 66 . Microwaves emitted from the irra diator 56 are projected on an affected coeliac tissue of a patient to be medically treated, for example, that in which a tumor is grown.
