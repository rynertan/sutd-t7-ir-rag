# PROCESS FOR PRODUCING SINTERED SILICON CARBIDE.

## Abstract
A process for producing a sintered silicon carbide having a high strength at elevated temperatures and a uniform fine structure, which comprises allowing an or ganosilicon polymer to be present on the surface of starting SiC particles of 1 Âµ or less in size to thereby precipitate super fine SiC particles produced from the organosilicon polymer onto the starting SiC particles in a heating step prior to a sintering step. The super fine SiC particles are extremely active in comparison with the starting SiC parti cles and are effectively precipitated between the starting SiC particles, and hence part of them serves to bond the starting SiC particles to each other. Thus, the substantial sinterability of a molding is enhanced, and sintering can be conducted in a nitrogen containing atmosphere without causing reduction in density and deterioration of bonding properties.
