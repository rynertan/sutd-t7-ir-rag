## Abstract
An FET device comprises a substrate with source and drain regions separated by a gate structure. Between the gate and substrate is an insulator formed of a cubic fluorite struc ture material that is lattice matched within 1 to the sub strate. The insulator may be a group II fluoride such as Ca
