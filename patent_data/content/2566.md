## Description
PROCESS FOR INJECTION MOLDING THERMOPLASTIC ARTICLES WITH REDUCED COMBUSTIBILITY The present invention relates to a process for injections molding thermoplastic articles with reduced combustibility. Injection molded thermoplastic articles which exhibit low combustibility properties would be a desirable addition to the marketplace. Whatever additives are used with the thermoplastic material to impart the reduction in combustibility should also have low toxicity, have low smoke generation, and be easily processible. One additive which will impart a reduction in combustibility is alumina trihydrate ATH , Al2O3.3H2O.This material doc have a low toxicity and low smoke generation. A problem with the material is that relatively high levels 50 percent ATH of it are required to achieve the desired reduction in combustibility.These high levels of ATH present extreme problems in processibility of the compound. In addition, high filler loadings also usually result in a precipitous loss in impact strength. This injection presents a way of overcoming the above mentioned problems. Water as a processing aid is used to increase the throughput cf the compound through the processing equi pent, ellowing a tough part with low combustibility to be formed. In accordance with the present invention, a process is provided for the production of injection molded thermoplastic articles having reduced combustibility comprising maintaining a mold cavity at a pre selected back pressure sufficiently high substantially to prevent foaming of a thermoplastic melt to be injected therein and injecting thermoplastic melt into the mold cavity under a pressure in excess of the back pressure to fill the mold cavity the said thermoplastic melt containing from about 50 to 70 by weight of alumina trihydrate and from about 1 to 12 by weight of water as E liquid processing ai. The invention employs thermoplastic polymers such as high density polyethylene HDPE , low dens it polyethylene, polypropylene, ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer, ethylene ethyl acrylate copolymer, and other homopolymers and interpolymers of olefins polystyrene and styrene copolymers such as a polymer of acrylonitrile, styrene, and butadiene polycarbonates such as 4,4 bis phenol A based polycarbonate, acetal homopolymers and copolymers polyamides such as nylon 6 and nylon 6 6 polyaryl polyhydroxy ethers e.g., the high molecular weight, base catalyzed, condensation product of 4,4 bis phenol A and epichlorohydrin polysulfones e.g. a polymer that can be represcent d by the formula EMI2.1 polyesters s2h as polyethylene terephthalate polymethyl methacrylate and other acrylic polymers and other thermoplastic polymers, which can be employed either singly or in mixtures. Conventional additives such as heat and light stabilizers, plasticizers, anti oxidants, fillers, dyes and other colorants, can be employed in the thermoplastic polymer composition It is to be understood that the back pressure maintained or the mold cavity may be any pressure sufficient te prevent foaming and preferably at or above 150 psi. Most conveniently a back pressure of the order of about 200 to 450 psi is employed. It has been found in the practice of the process of the inevntion that the pressure under which thermoplastic melt is introduced into the mold cavity may be any pressure greater than the back pressure of the mold.It has bee found preferable, however, to employ a pressure above about 1500 psi and, most preferably, a pressure of about 2500 tc 3500 psi as the introducing pressure. It has also been found that, in order to impart to the injection molded theroplastic articles the desired reduced combustibility characteristics, the thermoplastic melt should contain from about 50 to 70 by weight of alumina trihydrate. The employment of at least about 50 by weight of alumina tihydrate is required in order to achieve theUL 94 V O characteristics described hereinbelow and the employment of greater than about 70 by weight has been found to impart to the thermoplastic melt, flow characteristics which produce processing difficulties.A preferred range of alumina trihydrate content of from about 55 to 65 by weight is desired with the most preferred characteristics being imparted to the melt and resultant injection molded thermoplastic articles at about 60 by weight of alumina trihydrate content It has been additionally found that water may be employed, totalling from about 1 to 12 by weight of the thermoplastic melt, as a liquid processing aid. As discussed in more detail elsewhere herein, the water as processing aid addition serves to improve the flow characteristics of the thermoplastic melt which has been highly filled with alumina trihydrate Although the mechanism of the inventin is not completely understood, it is believed that the water as processing liquid passes along in the prooess admixed in the liquid state and, as such, carries over into the molded article as a series of liquid masses, providing no gross foaming characteristics to the resultant molded article. The water ultimately diffuses out, leaving an article of slightly lower density and containing some fine pores. This phenomenon is exhibited up t about the volume fraction of the water used in the molding. It is, hovever, to be understood that it is not the initial water processing liquid retention whIch provides the high combustibility resistance of the articles of the present invention, but rather, the high degree of filling with ATH. Tais high resistance to combustibility is retained even after the water diffuses from the resultant articles. The equipment suitable for use in the practice of the process of the invention is similar to but modified from that used to process conventional lou pressure process structural foam see, for example, Angell, U.S. Patents Nos. 3,268,636, 3,436,446 and 3,988,403 and particularly the equipment of Fig. 1 of U.S. Patent No. 3,436,445 . In the Drawins Fig. 1 is 2 graphical representation cf 2 relationship between the viscosity and the percentage constant of alumina mibydrate in the thermoplastic melt at two different sheer rates Fig. 2 is a side elevational view substantially in cross section. of apparatus suitable the practice of the process c the present invention and Fig. 3 is a plan view of a finger mold capable of use in practicing the process of the present invention. referred to hereinbalow as Mold No. 1 Fig. 4 is a plan view of a cavity mold capable of use it practicing the process of the invention, referred to hereinbelow as Mold No. 2 rig. 5 is a curve showing the relationship between Dart Drop impact strength and the varying number of ethoxy repeat units of the silane coupling agent empolyed for otherwise identical practics of the process of the invention in the production of inhection molded articles Fig. 6 is a curve showing the relationship between Dart Drop impact strangth and the varying back pressure applied to the cavity for otherwise iden tical practice of the process of the invention in the production of molded articles Fig. 7 is a curve showing the relationship between Dart Drop impact strength and the varying per centages of water used as a processing aid for otherwise identical practice of the invention in the production of molded articles Fig. 8 is a set of curves showin both the tensile strength and tensile modulus as a function of varying percentage of water used as a processing aid in molding for orherwise identical practice of the process of the invention in the production of molded articles Fig. 9 is a curve showing the relationship between flex modulus and the varying percentage of waser used as a processing aid for otherwise identical practice of the process of the invention in the production of molded articles and Fig. 10 is a curve showing the relationship between heat distortion temperature as a function of varying percentage of water used as a processing aid im otherwise identical practice of the process of the inven tion in the productions of molded articles. The additions to the apparatus which enable one to practice the invention are as follows First, the conventional structural foam apparatus provides means for the introduction of nitrogen gas into the extruder barrel to produce the foamable material. The process of the present invention requires the introduction of water as a processing liquid into the extruder barrel through line 7 of Fig. 2 of U.S. patent o. 3,436,466 in place cf the gas. As 2 result of the high pressure 1500 psi and temperature 375 400 F in the extruder barrel and the mixing action of the screw. the liquid introduced is distributed throughout the polyceric compound as it proceeds through the extruder. The second difference from the conventional low clamp pressure structural foam apparatures and that of the apparatus for practicing the invention is at the mold. The conventional apparatus allows the material which enters the mold cavity to expand and produce a foam product. If f that procedure were to be used for the liquid containing compound, the fast rate of pressure drop would cause the liquid to flash to vapor. This would result in a foamed molded part or imperfestions in the body or surfact of the part. To inhibit this undesirable facture, the mold cavity in back pressured, as shown by may of exampie, through conduit 40 in the mold of Fig. 3 of the draw ings, prior to introducing the moltem polymeric material.The back pressure is sufficintly high to inhibit most of the liquid from flashing. Hence the articles are essentially solid. For most materials, for the levels of liquid employed, the pressure required to reduce the flashing is of the order of at least about 100 psi. The actual pressure required to completely inhibit flashing is dependent on the particular liquid used, its vapor preesure, the melt temperature, and the rheology of the composition. The final molded parts are known to contain substantially the same amount of liquid as was introduced in the extruder. Hence, the parts ere not absolutely solid polymeric materials. In fact, it has been shown that molded parts from which the fluid has diffused will reabsorb about the same amount of fluid as was used in the molding.Hence, molded parts do have void volumes roughly equivalent to the concentration of fluid incerperated. These are assumed to be pore or channel like voids. To reiterats then, the parts appear from visual inspection to be essentially solid. That is, thay are not visibly cellular in the sense of structural form parts. The reminder of the process is substantially non critical and within the skill of the art. This includes cooling the part sufficiently so that the back pressure may relieved without foaming or other distortion and the part removed from the mold cavity. The importance of water as processing aid in the system rests on the ability to process polymeric systems with high levals of filler loading. As pointed out above, one ramification of this is the ability to process polymeric systems filled with ATH for reduced combustibility. A graphical representation of the problem is shown in Fig. 1. The apparent viscosity shear rate curves for a series of compounds containing various filler concentrations were obtained by use of an InstrenRheomater. The compounds were compounded in an 8 poundBanburry mixer, granulated, and then tested in theRheomater, using standard procedures at 190 C. The die diameter was 0.030 with a length to radius ratio of 67.1No Rabinowitsch corrections ware made to the shear rate and no and corrections made for the shear stress.The apparent viscosities at the lowest shear rates obtainable with the above mentioned Rheometer were then plotted against the percent ATH of each compound. The sharp rise in viscosity at about 40 percent ATH is indicative of the incressing difficulty in processing the compounds. The effect and usefulness of the liquid processing aid may be seen by comparing the throughput rates of filled polymeric systems molded with and without the use of liquids as set ferth in Table 7 below. Mathod 1. es referred to in the Table, relates to the case in which material is extruded from nozzle into the air.Method 2, as referred to in the Table, relates to the case in which parts are molded into a 6 x 18 x 1 2 rectangular mold cavity and the indicated back pressure used. Table 1 shows that the use Of a liquid processing aid increases the rate of flow through the nozzle and into and within the mold cavity. TABLE I Percent Mold Back Rate of Increase in rate liquid rel.

Referring now to Fig. 2 of the drawings, the rreferred apparatus of this invention for carrying out the present method is shown to include an extruder 6 having attached therato a line 7 for feeding a liquid processing aid directly into the barrel of extruder 6. A valve 8 is provided on line 7 to control the feeding. Line 9 connects the extruder 6 to the internal conduit 19 of a base member 19 which is shown resting on support member 20. Extending upward from the base member 19 is an accumulator device which includes a cylinder 10 and a piston 11 recIprocally movable therein. The piston 11 is shown having a frusto conical head 11 and is machined to nearly the same diameter as cylinder 10 to provide a seal between the cylinder 10 and the piston 11.Attched to rear of piston 11 and extending upward therefrom is a shaft 12. A flange member 13 is attached to the other end of the shaft 12 and a piston 14 is located on the shaft at a position intermediare the piston 11 and the flange 13. The piston 14 is adapted to reciprocate within a piston housing 32. It should be noted that flange 13 is located at the uppermost functional end of the shaft 12 and need not be located at the actual physical end thereof. The configuration of the flange 13 is critical only to the extent that it tust extend from the shaft 12 and contact switches 16 and 17 during the reciprocal movement of the shaft 12. Alternatively, photoelectric type switches can be employed if desired, thus eliminating the need for a projecting number on the shaft 12. A pair of photoelectric units can be positioned such that shaft 12 blocks the light path og lower unit when the shaft moves upwardly from ist lowest position and blockes the light path of an upper unit when it reaches the desired upper position. Leading from the internal conduit 19 of the base member 19 is a line 21 which is connected to an internal conduit 22 of a second base member 22 which is also resting on the support member 20. Extending downward from the base member 22, and through the support member 20 is a filling nozzle 23. It should be evident that a plurality of filling nozzles can be employed so mold one or more articles. The lower and of the nozzle 23 extends to and is flush with a mold cavity defined by a male mold half 25 and a female mold half 24. Mold half 24is conveniently affixed to the support member 20 and the mold half 25 is supported by a reciprocating bed 26 adapted to provide for easy separation of the mold halves 24 and 25 to facilitate product removal. Slidably mounted in the nozzle 23 und the base member 22 is a rod 27.The upper end of the rod 27 is provided with a piston 26 which reciprocates within a piston housing 33. The housing 33 is provided with a pair of conduits 29 and 30 which are alternately connected to a source of gas under pressure. The operation of the preferred apparetus shown in Fig. 2 is ass follows. Thermoplastic material is fluxed in the extruder 6. Water, as liquid processing aid, is admitted under pressure directly into the barrel of the ex truder by means of line 17 and is admixed therein with the melted thermoplastic. The extruder 6, which is in continous communication with an expanding accumulation zone 35 defined by the cylinder 10, the piston 11 and the base member 19, continuously extrudes the mixture of thermoplastic material and liquid processing aid through line 9, into the zone 35, and against the piston 11 As the mixture is fed from the extruder into the zone 35, the piston is forced from its lowermost position to an upper, predetermined position. In Fig. 2, the lowermost position of the piston 11 is reached when the piston 11 comes in contact with the base member 19.The upward traval of piston 11 and piston 14 is resisted by means of a gas under pressure in the region 15 above the piston 14 in the piston housing 32. The phrase gas under pressure is intended to include any suitable hydraulic fluid conventionally used in such apparates.In addition, the region 15 in the piston housing 32 is provided with a conduit 31 which is in communication with a source of gas under pressure. As the material from the extruder forces piston 11 upward, and at the sane time forces piton 14 upward, the gas in region 15 is compressed. Since the charging of the zone 35 is opposed by the piston 11, the filling of the zone 35 cannot start until the extruder pressure exceeds the back pressure of the piston 11. As the piston 11 moves upward, the gas volume in region 15 is decreased and the gas pressure is increased. The extruder pressure must continuously exceed the increasing piston pressure during the expansion of the zone 35.Alternatively, during the expansion of the zone 35, the pressure of the gas in region 15 can be regulated so that a substantially constant force is applied to the piston 14. In any case, the mixture being charged into the expanding zone 35 must be maintained at a presssure above which foaming ossurs. While a pressure of as low as abour 500 psi will normally prevent foaming of the mixture, pressures of at least 1500 psi have been found to give best result. Pressures in excess of 10.000 psi are usually not required for prepar operation of the accumulator device and normally should be avoided because operating expenses increase with increasing pressures. In addition, the cylinder 10 is provided with heating means, net shown, to maintain the mixture in the molten state and thus prevent solidification of thermoplastic material therein. It should be noted, however, that no heating of the mixture in the cylinder 10 is required. Heat is applied to the mixture in the extruder 6 and is only maintained in the cylinder 10. The piston 11 travels upward until the flange 13, carried by the shaft 12, contacts the switch 17 located at a predetermined. In a manner well known in the art, the activation of the switch 17 causes gas under pressure to enter piston housing 33 through conduit 29 and produces an upward motion of the piston 28. The lower end of the rod 27 is thereby withdrawn from the nozzle 23 until it reaches a position indicated by the reference numeral 37. Communication between the mold defined by mold halves 24 and 25 and the zone 35 is thus established.At the instant communication is established, the mixture is forced from the accumulation zone 35 into the mold because the pressure within the region 15, which has now become greater than the pressure within the one 35, causes the downward motion cf the piston 11 until is reaches its lower most position. If necessary, the line 21 and the base member 22 can be provided with heating means, not shown, to prevent solidification of thermoplastic material therein. When the piston 11 reaches Its lower most position the zone 35 is essentially collapsed and the flange 13 contacts the switch 16, and in a manner well known in the art, gas under pressure is caused to enter the piston housing 33 through conduit 30 thereby producing a downward movement of the piston 28 and the rod 27.At the instant the rod 27 enters the nozzle 23 at the point 36, communication is terminated between the mold and the accumulation zone 35 at a point where the pressure is above the foaming pressure of the mixture. As the rod 27 travels downward it forces the mixture in the nozzle 23, that is, between the pcint 36 and the mold, into the mold and the bottom of the rod 27 cones flush with the molded article 34. In this manner, a sprus free molded article is produced and the formation of an unfoamed lug in the system prevented. After cooling, the mold halves 24 and 25 are separated and the sprus free molded article 34 is removed. It should be evident that articles can be molded according to the present invention having sither a sprus or a depression simply by adjusting the rod 27. Kaile it is preferred to mold sprue free articles, the configuration of certain molded articles will be able to tolerate a sprue or a depression. The flow of gas under pressure through conduits 29 and 30 is controlled by means of value system actuated by the switches 16 and 17 in a nammer well known in the art. The switch 17 is positioned in accordance with the amount of material which is required to be charged into the mold. The greater the distance between the switches 16 und 17, the greater will be the upward travel of the piston 11. Consequently a larger amount of material will be stored in the accumulation zone 35 and subsquently ferced into the mold. Conversely, decreasing the space between the switches 16 and 17 decreases the amount of material which will forced into the mold. The temperature of the mold is not critical.Cold molds, e.g. at room temperature, about 20 C., can be used to produce molded articles. Lower mold temperatures are preferred since the time required for cooling the articles in the mold is shorter. Eigher mold temperatures permit more flow of the molten mixture in the mold prior to cooling than with a cooler mold. From the foregoing description, it is evident that the process and preferred apparatus of this invention can be employed to rapidity, efficiently, and automatically mold filled thermoplastic articles on a batch, semi continuous or continuous basis. The extrude 6 of the apparatus of Fig. 2 of the drawings used in the examples set forth herein employed a 2 1 2 diameter screw with a 24 1 length to diameter ratio. A 40 HP DC motor was employed utilizing a silicon control rectifier which pumped approximately 120 lb. hr. at 125 rpm. There were four hesting zones on the barrel. The two stage extrude screw had 24 flights. In the first stage, there were five feed flights at 0.440 depth, four transition flight, and four metering flights at 0.1110 depth. There was a 0.050 inch deep blistar at the end ef the firs stage.After one decompression flight at 0.300 depth. in which the fluid injection port was located, there was one transition flight, 6 1 2 metering flights at 0.135 depth.and two flights of LeRoy mixing head. A 50 ton press was used with this extruder. In the mold frame 24 overall length 9 x 20 shown in Fig. 3 of the drawings, the back pressure gas was maintained through inlet port 40 1 8 diam. 1 1 2 depth which communicated with gas manifold channel 42 1 4 wide, 1 8 depth which, in turn, communicated through ports 4L 3 32 x 1 32 with finger shaped channels 46 5 3 E x 1 2 x 3 8 which were inter communicating throughout the interior of the mold cavity The channels 46 were formed between spacer elements 48 5 3 8 x 1 . Thermoplastic melt material was intro ducked into the mold cavity through fill pert 50 3 4 diam .There was an O ring channel 52 1 8 width on both sides of this mold to reduce the loss og gas from the mold and contain the prescribed back pressure. As employed herein in connection with a measure of the combustibility of injection moldad thermoplastic articles, it is to be underwood that the specifications for degreas of combustibility are those set forth byUnderwrites Laboratories Inc. as Standard For TestsFor Flammability of Plastic Materials For Parts InDevices And Appliances, designated as UL 94 in their specification dated July 30, 1976 and set forth in Test 3 therein as Vertical Burning Test for ClassifyingMaterials 94 V O. 94 V 1. or 94 V 2 . A major objective of this invention is the processing of polymeric compounds which have reduced combustibility. The ATH filled polymer systems satisfy that objective. As shown in Table II, the use of 60 parts ATH allows the production of molded articles which pass the UL 94 V O flame test for 3 6 inch thick samples.Twenty three and a half and fifty percent ATH filled parts even with 18.8 percent water fail the UL 94 V O test. Sixty percent ATH filled high density polyethylene HPDE parts pass the UL 94 V O test at the same thickness. It is important to also point cut that the impact resistance as messured by the notched Izod tast shows a significant increase for the samples molded in the presence of water and that aven when those samples are dried, their Izod values remain quite close to that af a non filled HDPE sample. TABLE II All samples were molded in a 50 ton, modified structural foam machine using a high density polyethylene material HDPE of MI 8 gm 10 min ASTM D 1238E and specific gravity of 0.96 gm cc. The ATH used has a 1 average particle size. The mold was as shown inFig. 3, having dimensions set forth above. In each case the extruder temperatures were set at 3500F. and the transfer lines and accumuiator were set at 370 F.

Accordingly, the use of water as a liquid process aid allows greater throughput rates to be achieved and, as a particularly useful festure, allows parts with sufficiently high concentrations of ATH to be molded such the reduced combustibility parts with good impant strength may be produced. As referred to herein, the Dart Drop impact test consists of dropping a weighted dart about two pounds with a 1 1 2 inch hemispherical tip into a specimen finaly fixed by a 3 inch diameter circular clamp.The failure is noted by the apparance of a slight crack on the surface of the part. This invention additionally presents a process for molding high density polyethylene articles which have not only reduced combustibility but also excellent impas strength. Processibility of the ATH filled high density polyethylene compounds is improved by addition of water as a liquid processing aid as well as by use of the specific class of silene compatibility agents described hereinbelow. In accordance with this additional aspect of the present invention, 2 process is provided for the produc tion of Injection molded high density polyethylene articles having reduced combustibility and high impact strength conprising maintaining a mold cavity at a preselected back pressure sufficiently high to substantially prevent foaming of a high density polyethylene material melt to be injected therein injecting said melt into said mold cavity under pressure in excess of said back pressure to fill a mold cavity said high density polyethylene material melt containing a from about 30 to 70 by weight of alumina trihydrate, b from about 1 ti 12 by weight of water as a processing aid, and c fron about 0.5 to 3 by weight of 2 methoxy polyethylene glycol propylerimethoxy silane having the formula CH3O C3E4O nC3E6Si OCH3 3 wherein n represents the avarage number of ethoxy repeat mits between 3.0 and 11.0 It is to be understood that the back pressure maintained on the mold cavity may be any pressure sufficient to prevent foaming and preferably at or above 150 psi. Most conveniently a back pressure of the order of about 200 to 450 psi is empolyed. It has been found in the practice of the process of the invention that the pressure under which thermoplastic melt is injected into the mold cavity may be any pressure greater than the back pressure of the mold. It has been found preferable, however, to employ z pressure above about 1300 psi and, most preferably, a pressure of about 2500 to 3500 psi as the injection pressure. It has also been found that, in order to impart to the injection molded articles the desired reduced combustibility characteristics, the metl should contain from about 30 to 70 by weight of alumina trihydrate. The empolyment of at least about 30 by weight of alumina trihydrate is required in order to achieve the UL 94 V O characteristics descriebed hereinbelow and the employment of greater than about 70 by weight has been found to impart to the melt, flow characteristics which produce processing difficulties. A preferred range of alumina trihydrate content of from about 35 to 65 by weight is desired with the most peferred characteristics being imparted to the melt and resultant injection molded articles at about 60 by weight of alumina trihydrate content. As discussed in more detail elsewhere herein, the employment of water as a processing aid in amount from about 1 to 12 by weight serves to increase the rate of flow of the theroplastic melt which has been highly filled with alumina trihydrate. To attain V O levels of reduced combustibility, 60 percent ATH filled HDPE has been found to be required.At that level of filler loading, the impact strength of the materials is no very good. To improve the impact strength, a surface treament agent must be applied to the ATH to improve compatibility of the ATH and the HDPE. A number of copatibility agents have been avaluated, some yielding an improvement in impact strength. A number of tethoxy polyethylene glycol propyl trimethoxy silanes were tested which have varying n avarage ethoxy repeat units in the formula CH3O C2H4O n C3H6 Si OCH3 3The compatibility agents tested and the results of such testing are shown in Table IV.

Further evaluetions of Dart DropImpact strength of products mad with other compatibility agents showed that Product No.5 gave much lower impact strengths than Product No.2, the latter having a DartDrop Impact value of 33 ft lb for the particular molding conditions used. Note also fro Tables IV and V that theProduct numvered 2 which has 60 parts ATH gives an impact strength of 33 ft lb other samples made wich this same compatibility agent gave as high as 44 ft lb and that a structural foam article molded as Product No.8 Table V , which has no ATH and a 0.85 specific gravity, has an impact strength of 28 ft lb. The use of the selected silane compatibility agent acts as a coating applied to the ATH surface and helps to make the ATH more compatible with the HDPE. Nota also that the Product No.6, 60 parts ATH without any compatibility agent, has a very low impact strength 1 1 2 ft lb in the Dart Drop test and 0.18 ft lb inch of notch In the Izod test.

Fig.5 of the drawings shows the graphical results. Note that the Dart Drop value for n 7.2 was interpolated to 9.9 percent water to match the percent water used for n 3 and 11. At n 17.5 the only data obtained were at 7.1 percent H2O and they were plotted directly Fig.5 schowa a maximum of approximately 21 ft lb at about n 7.2 repeat units.Along with the specific compatibility agent used to treat the ATH, there are a number of other processing variables which directly affect the resultant molded article. The variables studied include the back pressure applied to the mold, the compounding tine, the percent water used in molding, and the percent compatibility agent on the ATH. The pressure applied to the mold cavity prior to injection of the plastic is tarned the back pressure.Parts molded at different back pressures have very different mechanical properties. As seen in Fig.6, the Dart Drop Impact strength of samples molded at the specifications of Table IV show a significant increase with back pressure. Up to 400 psi back pressure, theDart Drop Impact strengths increase To 44 ft lb. Hence, to attain the largest impact strength, the back pressure should be in the 300 400 psi range. TABLE VIAll of these articles were molded with 60 parts ATH, 40 parts HDPE 8 melt index, 0.96 spec. grav. .1 part compatibility agent No.2, and 7 8 percent weigt, Mold No.2 at 70 C was used throughent.All samples were dried 70 C, 48 hours before testing.

Athough any mathod of compounding of the treated with silane ATH and the polyathylene will procedure a product which feed into the extruder, the use of a Banbury has, to date, proved the most satisfactory. Any compounding procedure which fluxes and gives some history of high shear rate for a sufficiently long time should be satisfactory.In terms of the Banbury operation, Table VII shows that the DartDrop Impact values are substantially lower for the case of either 3 minutes or 0 zero minutes of compounding after fluxing in the Banbury. Note also that the latter sample does not even pass the UL 94 V 0 tast. Toe last factor inevstigated which can greatly affect the mechanical properties, and impact strength in particular, cf molded parts is the percent water used during the molding. Even rhourgh in all cases the samples wera dried prior to testing large differences in the impact strengths were found as a function of the concentration of water used for the molding process. This indi cites that the presence of the water affects the interfacial action which can occur. The specific compatibility agent nots synergistically with cartain concentrations of waterSpecifically, Pigs. 7, 8, 9 and 10 show how one can determine the concentration of water to use.For most cases it is expected that the maximum impact strenght will be deriable Fig. 7 evan at the expense of tensile and flexural properties and that distortion temperature Figs. 8, 9 and 10 . If that is the case, approximately 8 percent water should be used in the molding. If slight decreases in impact strenght are acceptable, the other mechanical properties can be increassed by a decrease in the concentration of water used in molding. It is especially noteworthy that with ne er very low concentration of water 2 percent , the impact strength is extremely low, ft lb. Another variable which must be considered in the level of compatibility agent used. The compatibility agent No. 2 was used to mean ATH. Compounds at 60 percent tre ed ATH 2 percent HDPL MI 8, spec. gr. 0.96 ware prepared. As seen in Table VIII, above 1 percent silame there is a slight loss in Dart Drop impact strenght.Notica else that at the 3 percent level of this coupling agent, the sample only marginally passes the UM 94 V O rest. Good impact strengths can be obtained with approxitately 1 percent concentration of compatibility agent No.2. This is the preferred level. As expexted, the use of the untreated ATH zero percent silance yields a product with poor impact strenght 3 ft lb thus pointing out the necessity of the compatibility agent. TABLE VII The HDPL used for this series of tests has a 0.96 specific gravity and 8 melt index and was present in the compound at 40 parts by weight. The ATH had a concentration of 60 parts and has a 1 average particle size. The methoxy pohyethylane glycol propyl trimethoxy silane with 7.2 repeat units compatibility agent No.2 of Table IV was used throughout at the 1 part level.All samples were molded in Mold No. 2 against 300 psi back pressure. From scanning electrom micrographs 1700X and x ray energy spectrographs, all three samples had excellent apparent dispersions of the ATH.

Note that for the 60 percent ATH samples without compatibility agent Product No. 24 and with compatibility agent Product No. 23 27 these was no zero smoke generation and very rate of hast release maximum of 225 KW min mê. The structural foam article of Product No.25 hand a total 844 smoke mê and a total hast release of 1721 KW min mê. As a point of referance, the data for maple wood Product No. 29 show that it has a total hast release of 883 KW min mê and a smoke release of 148 smoke mê. The limiting Oxygen Index test messures the concentration of oxygen required in a specifig chamber to just support combustion of a given size sample. As seen in Table X. the oxygen index of unfilled polyethylene is 817.6 percent wheras the polyethylenes filled wirh 60 percent ATH with or without compatibility agents have oxygen indices of 28 percent. This is a marked reduction of combustibility. TABLE IX All samples were prepared wirh EDPE 8 MI, 0.96 sp. gr.
