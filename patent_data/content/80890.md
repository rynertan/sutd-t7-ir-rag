# Interface circuit for subsystem controller.

## Abstract
An Interface Circuit Card for interfacing a subsystem controller called a Network Support Processor in a data communications system to a main host computer and to a plurality of line support processors which service data communications lines to remote terminals, The Interface Circuit Card provides a data link interface logic circuit DLI for connecting the master processor of the Network Support Processor to a distribution control card which contacts the main host system computer. The Interface Circuit Card also provides a message level interface MLI logic circuit which connects the master processor to another distribution con trol card for connection to a line support processor and also to buses which connect to a master memory control card for accessing a shared memory means.
