# Method of manufacturing a die cast wobble plate assembly.

## Abstract
An improved method of manufacturing a swash plate as sembly 50 for use in a compressor, fluid motor or similar device in which a plurality of pistons 30 are connected, by means of connecting rods 10 , to a swash plate 40 which drives or is driven by the pistons. A plurality of ball 12, 13 ended rods 10 of a predetermined length having a pair of split dieinserts 14, 15 positioned about the rod, each against one of the balls. The balls are positioned in a die means 51 having a central core 52 to locate their position and which die means securely maintains the inserts against each of the ball ends. About one ball end of the rod, a piston 30 with or without a slot is cast and the opposite ball end, which is positioned in a mating swash plate socket, has a swash plate 40 cast about it. The finished assembly is machined for overall length, surface parallel, and, angular and diametral relationships.
