# Improvements in or relating to the measurement of the size of particles.

## Abstract
A method of determining the size of spherical particles, comprising the operations of illuminating with a beam of circularly polarised light particles the size of which is to be determined, detecting light backscattered by the particles, measuring the angular intensity distribution of the backscat tered light and deriving therefrom an indication of the size of the particles. Various forms of apparatus for carrying out the method also are described.
