# A dry etching method for a chromium or chromium oxide film.

## Abstract
The dry etching rate of a Cr film has been increased by adding ethyl or methyl alcohol vapor to an etchant gas containing a halide of a hydrocarbon such as CCl₄ and oxygen gas. The dry etching rate increase is attributed to the reduction reaction of a dry etching product, CrO₂Cl₂, into chemically stable CrCl₃, the reduction reaction suppresses deposition of Cr generated by the decomposition of chemic ally unstable CrO₂Cl₂.
