## Description
DIAGNOSTIC METHOD The present invention relates to a diagnostic method for the determination of a factor or factors hereinafter called for short LCMEF2 , which enhances the cortisol metabolism in lymphocytes or leucocytes hereinafter called for short lymphocytes , in serum or plasma hereinafter called for short plasma and to a test kit to be used for this method. The method is particularly suitable for the diagnosis of cancer. It is possible to demonstrate in the plasma of patients with a cancerous disease the presence of antigens which are associated with neoplasma or tumors in certain organs. This can be achieved by chemical, and especially immuno chemical, techniques. It is known that lymphocytes of cancer patients have an enhanced cortisol metabolism in comparison with that of healthy donors, whereby cortisol is metabolised to e.g. tetrahydro cortisol, 20a hydrocortisol and 20ss hydrocortisol. See Klein et al., Metabolism, Vol. 27,No. 6 June 1978 . For said metabolism of cortisol a higher activity is found for lymphocytes in Q homologous plasma, i.e. plasma and lymphocytes obtained from the same healthy donor, than in a tissue culture medium R Rosewell Park Memorial Institute nutrient . A heterologous plasma, i.e. plasma and Iymphocytes not obtained from the same healthy donor, shows a similar activity to that of the homologous plasma. It should thus have been expected that the plasma of cancer patients would enhance the cortisol metabolism in at least a similar manner to the enfancement generated by the plasma of healthy donors. It has now been found surprisingly that the enhancement caused by the plasma of cancer patients on the contrary is less than that caused by the plasma of healthy persons. This is apparently due to the fact that in the plasma of cancer patients one or more factors, i.e. SCMEF is either absent or present in a diminished concentration as compared with that found in healthy plasma donors. SCMEF is at least partially responsible for the enhancement of the cortisol metabolism. It has thus been found that lymphocytes of a healthy donor in a system with a heterologous plasma of a cancer patient show a considerably lower enhancement of the cortisol metabolism than those lymphocytes in a system with a homologous plasma or a heterologous plasma of a healthy donor. Moreover, the removal of their tumors did not lead to an enhanced cortisol metabolism in the plasma of cancer patients. Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for the diagnosis of a factor deficiency disease, especially cancer, in a suspected patient, which method comprises determining in plasma or serum from the patient the concentration of a factor or factors which enhances the cortisol metabolism in lymphocytes or leucocytes and comparing it with the concentration of said factor or factors in plasma or serum of a healthy donor. The present invention will be illustrated herein with reference to the diagnosis of cancer. However, it is not restricted thereto and may be utilised for the diagnosis of any disease or malfunction in which the concentration of LIEF is different in the plasma of healthy persons from that of diseased persons, e.g., people suffering from liver malfunction. In connection with this invention lymphocytes of a healthy donor means lymphocytes and leucocytes of human beings or of other animals. Particularly suitable are the lymphocytes of human beings and of cattle, sheep and swine. The quantitative determination of the concentration of LA g can be achieved using many common physical, chemical and biological methods. Thus, it can be achieved by the determination of the level of cortisol labelled or unlabelled or of one or more of its metabolites. This can be done, for example, by the use of radio chemical techniques in which lymphocytes, a hydrogen donor agent, the plasma to be tested and a cortisol substrate are incubated. The substrate and metabolites are then extracted, separated and the radioactivity is scanned. If desired, controls using on the one hand a healthy plasma and on the other hand plasma of a known cancer patient can be determined in pArallel. However, it is advantageous to make use of the immuno chemical properties of LCMEF. For instance, this can be achieved using an immuno precipitation technique without label, such as immuno diffusion, immuno electro phoresls, radial immuno diffusion, rocket electrophoresis and immune electron microscopy, or with label, such as haemagglutination, complement fixation, immuno fluorescence, radio immuno assay and enzyme immuno assay. Furthermore, a metal can be used as label in an immuno chemical reaction. Immuno chemical components can be obtained in known manner by immunisation of a proper animal. The diagnostic determination can be carried out as homogenous heterogenous enzyme immuno assay. Preferably, the immuno chemical determination is carried out as a competitive test, the factor or factors being directly coupled to an enzyme. In one preferred embodiment of the present invention there is provided a method for diagnosing cancer in a patient comprising the steps of a preparing a suitable medium containing a hydrogen generating system and a mixture of i plasma or serum from the patient, ii lymphocytes from a donor known to be free of cancer as herein defined , and iii cortisol b incubating said medium for a predetermined period of time to effect metabolism of the cortisol by the lymphocytes c measuring the rate of metabolism of the cortisol and d comparing said measured rate of metabolism with the rate of metabolism of cortisol in a reference medium prepared and incubated in the same manner as steps a and b above except that the included plasma or serum is from a donor known to be free of cancer. The hydrogen generating system is preferably a NADPH generating system. In a similar manner the above preferred method can be utilised for the diagnosis of any other disease or malfunction in which the concentration of L F is different in the plasma of healthy persons from that of diseased persons, e.g. people suffering from liver malfunction. In the case where on incubation of normal lymphocytes with plasma of a healthy donor the resulting cortisol metabolism rate is regarded as lO0 a, 2 comparable rate of 65 metabolism or below for a suspected patient would be considered as an indication of disease such as cancer or liver malfunction. Said method has to be performed substantially at the physiological pH namely 7.4. It can be performed if desired with lyophilised sonicated lymphocytes in a reconstituted medium. As will be shown hereinafter the factor or factors have a molecular weight between 1000 and 100001 . More over, the activity of LCMER is elimlnated hy heating the plasma or a faction comprising the LIMED to approximately 1000C st pH 1 and under the influence of Pronase. The addition of plasma comprising LONER or preferably the addition of isolated or purified LCMEF to the plasma of cancer patients enhances the cortisol metabolism of the lymphocytes in said patients. Thus the administration of ACMES can serve as therapy in LONER deficient patients and this use of LCMEF is also within the scope of the present invention. The invention also provides a test kit using radiochemical techniques including jininuno chemical techniques.suitable embodiment thereof contains for instance antibodies, optionally insolubilised, the enzyme labelled factor or factors and a substrate that can be converted by the enzyme labelled factor or factors. However, many other combinations are possible. It is an important advantage of the diagnostic determination and test kit according to the invention, compared with known diagnostic methods, which are based on antigens associated with neoplasma, that the rheuma factor does not interfere. The present invention will now be illustrated by the following examples without being limited by them.Example 1 Lymphocytes were prepared from so called buffy coats of the blood bank. These were isolated by centrifugation at 400 g using the Ficol Isopac method, washed twice and resuspended in a phosphate buffered saline solution PBS with a pH of approximately 7.4 containing penicillin and streptomycin, 100 IU ml each.This suspension contained 108 lymphocytes per ml and was divided into series of flasks. To each flask a NADPH generating system comprising a solution of 1.0 Whole NADPH, 5.0 moles of glucose 6 pbosphate, 1.0 Korenberg unit of glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase and 1.4 moles of MgCl2 in 0.1 ml PBS, 50 g of unlabelled cortisol and 5.0 pCi of 1.2 3H cortisol were added. To each flask 1.0 ml of one of the following solutions or suspensions was subsequently added 1 PBS 2 homologous plasma, belonging to the donor of the lymphocytes hip 3 heterologous plasma, belonging to another healthy donor HeP 4 plasma of a patient with a cancerous disease, which disease had not yet been treated CPP 5 HP, that has been heated to approximately 1000C 6 CPP, that has been heated to approximately 1000C 7 heteroloòus plasma of patients, more than 70 years old, with a non cancerous disease HePPa 8 mixed plasma, consisting of concentrated HP diluted with CPP to the original volume of HP. A blank contained all components except the lymphocytes. The sealed flasks ere incubated in a shaking bath at 37OQ for 17 hours. At the end of the incubation period the contents of each flask were extracted twice with 5 ml of chloroform and evaporated to dryness under a nitrogen atnosphere The residue was dissolved in ethanol and applied on silica gel HE 254 thin layer plates. The plates were developed in chloroform methanol 90 10 v v . Following chromatography the plates were reviewed in UV1ight at 254 nm and scanned using a radioactivity scanner Berthold LB 2723 . The product and substrate spots as well as the remainder of the plate were scraped off and extracted with ethanol. The volume of the extract was adjusted to 5.0 ml with ethanol.Samples of 0.1 ml were transferred into scintillation vials and the radioactivity read in a liquid scintillation spectrometer Packard 3390 . mhe cortisol metabolism was calculated from the data obtained by this procedure. The results are given in Table I TABLE I Plasma Number of Cortisol measurements conversion PBS 40 37 HP 39 100 HeP 22 91 app 36 62 HePPa 5 91 XPw 9 63 CPP 9 57 HP CPP 5 96 Plasma, that has been heated to approximately 1000C. The conversion of cortisol in HP is set to 100 . It appears from the data described in the table that apP shows a considerably lower cortisol metabolism than HP, HeP and HePPa and is of the same order or magnitude as heated HP. In this test and others carrying out double blind test studies on a sample of patients suffering from various diseases including cancer a cortisol conversion rate of less than 65 of normal plasma for not heated plasma indicated that the donor has a cancerous disease. It is confirmed by the result for HP CPP that this decreased metabolism is not due to an inhibition factor in CPP This shows that the administration of L MEF can serve as replacement therapy to LCMET deficient persons.Example 2 A similar test as described in example 1 was performed. However, said test was performed with unlabelled cortisol. After incubution the percentages of cortisol left were measured in each flask with RIL RadioImmuno Assays . The results obtained are given in Table II. TABLE II Plasma Non converted cortisol PBS 95 HP 83 CPP 92 The above shows a conversion of 47 for CPP when the HF conversion is taken as 100 . Example 3 Lymphocytes prepared from so called buffy coats of the blood bank were sonicated with the addition ofPBS at pH 7.4 in the course of 1 minute. The mixture obtained was lyophilised and the powder obtained was kept at 200C. When the test had to be performed said powder was dissolved in distilled water up to the original cell suspension volume. Thereafter the test was performed in the same manner as described in Example 1.The results obtained are given in Table III. TABLE III Plasma Cortisol Conversion PBS 58. woo HP 100 CPP 34.9 Example 4 A similar test as described in Example 1 was performed. However, the lymphocytes were replaced by leucocytes obtained from a cow. The results obtained are given in Table IV. TABLE IV Plasma Cortisol Conversion PBS 27 Cow HP 185 HaP 100 CPP 54 ExamDle 5 Human plasma was diluted with PBS 1 1. It was ultra filtrated on an Amicon U.M. 10 membrane. It was found that the factor or factors were in the filtrate which indicated that it had a molecular weight lower than 10,000 D. Said filtratc was then filtered through an Amicon U i2 membrane and the active fraction was retained indicating that the molecular weight of the factor or factors was higher than 1000 D. The filtrate obtained after the first filtration was then divided and each portion was subjected to one of the following treatments 1. heated to 1000C 2. pH reduced to 1 3. treated with Pronase of various origins.One portion was kept untreated. The cortisol conversion of the treated portions in comparison with the untreated portion is shown in Table V TABLE V Treatment Cortisol Conversion PBS 41.1 Untreated 100 pH change 51.5 Heat treatment 39.20 Pronase 53.6 Example 6 A group of 59 hospital patients were tested as explained in Example 1 for the rate of cortisol conversion. Out of this group 19 were known cancer cases 3 glioma, 1 heDatoma, 2 bladder carcinoma, 2 colon carcinoma, 2 pancreas carcinoma, 5 lunar carcinoma, 1 stomach carcinoma, 1 ovary carcinona, 1 adrenal carcinoma with metastases, 1 hypernephroma .Seventeen out of the nineteen cases had rates below 65 ranging between 28 and 63ss. Two cases 1 lung and 1 colon had values of 87 and 92 respectively and thus in about 10 of the cases false negative results were obtained. Out of the 40 patients with various other diseases, 35 had a rate of above 65 ranging between 69 and 109X while 5 cases were below 65 range 36 6. . These cases were suffer ing from hapatitis 36,h of HY ,pneumonia, urinary tract infection, heart disease and Cushing syndrome. Thus in 12.5 of these cases false positive results were obtained. However, we have additional indications that nonmalignant liver malfunctions including the above hepatitis almost always 22 23 have a low LCNEF. Thus the rate of LCNEF indicates also the cases of liver malfunctions. However, in the non malignant cases the values return to normal in cured patients while they stay low in the malignant cases.
