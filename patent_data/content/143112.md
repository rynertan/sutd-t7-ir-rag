SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Generally, the present invention is predicated on a simple determination of operative temperature as the function of air temperature sensed by an ambient temperature sensor and the temperature sensed by a temperature sensing means which may comprise a globe thermometer which is a function of the mean radiant temperature. The electrical signals derived from the air temperature sensor and the temperature sensing means are weighted by heat transfer coefficients such that when algebraically added their sum is equal to unity. In this way we avoid the need for expensive measuring devices to determine mean radiant temperature. More specifically, and in accordance with the invention, we provide an operative temperature sensing system for sensing operative temperature, comprising an air temperature sensor for generating a first signal having a value that is a function of the air temperature within an enclosed space temperature sensing means located within said enclosed space for generating a second signal having a value that is a function of mean radiant temperature characterized by a first signal modifying circuit for changing the value of said first signal by a first fixed and predetermined amount a second signal modifying circuit for changing the value of said second signal by a second fixed and predetermined amount said first and second fixed and predetermined amounts representing values that are functions of the size and shape of said second temperature sensing means and being so related that their sum is equal to unity and circuit means for combining the modified first and second signals to develop an output signal having a value that is a function of operative temperature within the enclosed space. The air temperature sensor is advantageously located adjacent to the temperature sensing means. The enclosed space may be a room or an apartment the temperature of which is to be controlled to provide a predetermined comfort level. The temperature sensing means may comprise a globe and sensor, hereinafter a globe thermometer. The outer surface of the globe may be spherical but other shapes can be used, although a spherical globe is preferred. In the case of a globe, since globe temperature T g is a function of mean radiant temperature Tr and ambient temperature Ta , the operative temperature two becomes a function of air and globe temperature. Accordingly, the signals generated by the air temperature sensor and the globe thermometer sensor are representative of the operative temperature. Objects, features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following disclosure taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Fig. 1 is a diagrammatic representation of the ambient sensor and the radiant temperature related sensing means of the present invention and Fig. 2 is a circuit diagram of the electronic components for developing an output signal indicative of operative temperature from the sensor illustrated in Fig. 1. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT As indicated above, the operative temperature To is given by cTa HrTr HC Hr . The sensing system of the present invention includes an air or ambient temperature sensor 10 depicted schematically in Fig. 1 which sensesTa in an enclosure, such as a room. Sensor 10 may be suitably mounted on a base or support 12 and is located adjacent the radiant temperature related sensing means which may comprise globe 14 mounted on a suitable pedestal or the like 16. The globe part 14 of the sensing means, as shown is spherical although other suitable shapes may be employed and has housed therein a sensor not illustrated in Fig. 1 but forming part of the sensing means, which sensor develops a signal indicative of the temperature Tg within the globe as is well known.This temperature Tg is a function of mean radiant temperature Tr and the ambient temperature in the enclosure or room. Since the globe 14 and the sensor housed therewithin,namely the globe thermometer, are well known in the art, the specific construction thereof will not be further discussed and it is to be understood that the numeral 14 depicts the globe thermometer as a unit, including the sensor within the globe. As will be evident from the disclosure to follow temperatures Ta and T g are suitably modified or weighted by predetermined constants and algebraically combined such that an output signal is developed that is a function of operative temperature To Referring to Fig. 2, the sensor 10 of Fig. 1 is schematically represented at 100 and the globe thermometer 14 is represented at 140. The signals from 140 and 100 are suitably amplified by amplifiers 150 and 160, respectively, which may be high impedance buffer amplifiers which allow the high output impedance of the temperature sensors to be inputed to the remaining control circuitry.The outputs from amplifiers 150 and 160 representative of Tg and Ta, respectively are fed through series resistors Rl to second amplifiers 180 and 200, respectively. Shunt resistors R3 and R4 are provided across amplifiers 180 and 200, respectively, such that the output signals of amplfier 180 at point A is equal to R3 Rl Tg and the output signal of amplifier 200 at point B is equal to R4 Rl Ta. It should be apparent that R3 R1 and amplifier 180 and R4 R1 and amplifier 200 function as modifying circuit means for the signal from globe thermometer 140 and air sensor 100, respectively. These signals are combined through amplifier 210, resulting in an output signal at point C which is equal to R3 R1 Tg R4 R1 Ta the values of resistors R5,R6, R7, and R8 all being equal to each other.It should be thus readily apparent that proper choice of the values or range of values of R1, R3 and R4 will result in a signal at point C that is a function of operative temperature T, . This signal at point C then may be compared to a set point reference signal at point S, which is suitably developed by a variable potentiometer P and an amplifier 220, to determine the difference in value between To and a setpoint temperature Ts for control and or indication purposes. To this end the signals at point C and point S are fed into a comparative amplifier 240 to generate an error signal at point E indicative of the difference therebetween. Thus, the signal at point E is equal to the algebraic sum of T5 and T,. The resistors R9,R10,R11 andR12 may all be of equal value. An example of the manner in which the predetermined values R3 R1 and R4 R1 may be determined as weighting factors for Ta and Tg will now be discussed.However, it should be understood that the actual values given are exemplary of one set of parameters and should, not be interpreted as universally applicable. According to American Society of HeatingRefrigeration and Air Conditioning Engineers ASHRAE standard 55 81 at air speeds less than 40 feet minute To .42 Ta .58 TrHowever, since at steady state the heat absorbed by the globe 14 by radiation is equal to the heat transferred by the globe by convection, then Tr Tg HC Hr Tg Ta Under test conditions, it may be determined that Hc Hr 1.2When using, a hollow sphere having a diameter of substantially 1i inches for globe 14, then, from the above Tr Tg 1.2 Tg Ta and To .42 Ta .58 2.2 Tg 1.2 Ta or To 1.276 Tg .276 Ta Thus, it can be seen that the value of R3 R1 should substantially equal 1.28 and the value of R4 R1 should substantially equal .28.In this example, then, resistor values for R1, R3 and R4 of 10K, 12.8K and 2.8K, respectively, would provide the ASHRAE standard for To wherein a 1i inch diameter hollow sphere is used for globe 14. The sphere may be fabricated of any suitable material, as is well known in the art. It is also apparent that the relationship between the fixed and predetermined values of R3 R1 and R4 R1 is such that when the two are added together or summed, the resulting value 1.28 .28 1 will always be one or unity, as will be the sum of the weighting factors .42 and .58 for Ta and Tr, respectively. It should be realized that other sizes, shapes and types of globes would result in other values for R1,R3 and R4. Also, larger air currents would similarly result in other values for these resistors. In fact, globe 14 could be of any regular or irregular geometric shape. Many different types of sensors may be used for sensing Ta and Tg however it has been found that sensors such as National Semiconductor LM 3911 produce accurate and linear results. The output of each sensor may be calibrated to be 10 MV C. The present invention has disclosed for illustrative purposes a simple yet effective technique and structure for quickly and inexpensively determining operative temparature. Various modifications will occur to those skilled in the art and it is therefore intended that the present invention be limited only by the scope of the appended claims.
