# Vibrio cholerae mutants, vaccine comprising them, method for preparing a subunit therefrom and composition comprising it.

## Abstract
Vibrio cholerae, Ogawa serotype, El Tor biotype, are subjected to the mutagenic N methyl N nitro n nitroso guanidine NTG . First generation mutants are screened for toxin production, and in particular the absence of A or enzymatically active subunit production and production of B binding subunit. Putative A B mutants are again exposed to NTG and screened for the A B characte ristics. The formulae of the native toxin molecule is usually A B ₅ ₆ the formulae for the molecule produced by the selected second generation mutant is A B ₅ ₆. This mutant strain is used for production of a live vaccine which can be administered orally. The mutant has been found to induce immunity, in an experimental model system, to subsequent challenge with virulent cholera vibrios. Because of the immunologic relatedness of other enterotoxins such as the heat labile enterotoxin of Escherichia coli , the mutant may also induce immunity to other diarrheal diseases than cholera. In fact, antiserum to the isolated toxin related protein produced by the mutant has been shown to neutralize E. coli enterotoxin. The mutant may also be used for the production of cholera genoid , the non toxic, highly immunogenic B portion of the cholera enterotoxin choleragen without the compli cation of toxicity of the product.
