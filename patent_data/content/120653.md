# Flashing for corrugated roofs and the like.

## Abstract
A flashing 10 has a front portion 12 shaped to overlie a corrugated roof, and an upstanding rear portion 16 for attachment to a wall. They are connected hingedly, so the flashing can adapt to any roof wall angle. Preferably the flash ing 10 is a unitary plastics moulding with a line of weakness 14 constituting a resilient hinge so that the portions 12,16 are urged against roof and wall.

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. An apron flashing 10 having first 12 and second 16 longitudinal portions, at least said first portion 12 being corrugated 18,20 , said portions 12,16 being mutually laterally adjacent, characterised in that said portions 12,16 are connected so that the angle between them is variable. 2. A flashing 10 according to claim 1 which comprises a shaped unitary web, having a line of weakness 14 between the first 12 and second 16 portions to permit said angular variation. 3. A flashing 10 according to claim 1 or claim 2 wherein said portions 12,16 are connected so that the angle between them is variable resiliently. 4. A flashing 10 according to claim 3 wherein the portions 12,16 are resiliently urged to an angle greater than the intended angle of use, so that when fitted to a structure the portions 12,16 are resiliently urged against respective parts of the structure. 5. A flashing 10 according to any preceding claim made of transparent or translucent plastics material. 6. A flashing 10 according to any preceding claim wherein the second portion 16 is provided with adhesive means for attachment to a wall. 7. A flashing 10 according to any preceding claim wherein the second portion 16 has a rearwardly extending portion for bedding into a wall against which said portion 16 lies in use. 8. A method of sealing between an upright wall and a corrugated sheet extending away from it comprising providing an apron flashing 10 according to any preceding claim whereof the corrugated first portion 12 is shaped to lie flush on said corrugated sheet and locating the flashing with its first portion 12 flush with said sheet and its second portion 16 flush with said wall.

## Description
FLASHING FOR CORRUGATED ROOFS AND THE LIKE The present invention relates to apron flashing.That is to say, it relates to a product suitable for sealing between a first structure, such as a corrugated roof, and another structural element, such as an upright wall. Corrugated sheeting is widely used for low cost building applications, such as car ports, and verandahs.Often it is necessary to connect a length of corrugated sheet, which is to form a roof, to an upright wall e.g.of an existing building . It is desirable to prevent the passage of rain water past the joint. The usual solution is to use some form of flashing, that is to say an elongate strip which is shaped so that one longitudinal portion can be in contact with the corrugated sheet while a second portion is in contact with the wall.Thus a flashing must be provided which matches the angle of the particular roof, or the roof must be angled to suit the available flashing. With lightweight plastics roofing it is particularly difficult to achieve a seal, since e.g. hammering to shape and dress unformed material is likely to shatter the roofing. According to the present invention, there is provided an apron flashing having first and second longitudinal portions, at least said first portion being corrugated, said portions being mutually laterally adjacent and connected so that the angle between them is variable, preferably resiliently. Preferably the flashing comprises a shaped unitary web, having a line of weakness between the first and second portions to permit said angular variation. At least the first portion is preferably corrugated similarly to the corrugated sheeting with which it is intended to be used. It is especially preferred for the flashing to comprise transparent or translucent plastics material. This makes it particularly suitable for use with transparent or translucent corrugated sheet material. Of course, coloured and or opaque materials may be used. When unconstrained, the two portions of the flashing may be at an angle greater than that which is expected to be required in use. Thus, when the flashing is fitted, the first portion is resiliently urged against the corrugated sheet. In another aspect, the invention provides a method of connecting a corrugated sheet to an upright wall by means of a flashing as just described. An embodiment of the invention will now be described in greater detail with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Fig. 1 is a plan view of an apron flashing embodying the invention Fig. 2 is a front elevation and Fig. 3 is an end elevation. The illustrated flashing 10 consists of a shaped sheet of a transparent plastics material, such as PVC, or other material from which corrugated roofing sheets are conventionally made. The flashing 10 has a front portion 12 integral with a rear portion 16. The front portion 12 is corrugated, with troughs 18 and crests 20 extending outwardly away from the back of the portion 12. Between the front and rear portions 12, 16 there is an upstanding U section channel 14 formed adjacent the bottom of the rear portion 16. This forms a line of weakness which allows the angle between the front and rear portions 12,16 to be varied, while resiliently biassing them to a particular configuration. In the illustrated embodiment, this favoured configuration has the portions 12,16 at an angle of about 1200. The flashing 10 can be produced in widths and thicknesses to suit particular types of corrugated roofing sheets. In use, the front portion 12 may be secured to a roofing sheet when this is being fixed in place. For example, if the sheet is to be fixed by having nails driven through it, then these nails pass also through the flashing 10. The upstanding rear portion 16 is then secured, e.g. to an upright wall. An adhesive flashing tape may be used for this purpose. Alternatively, there may be a down turned angle section over the top edge of the back portion 16, and this may be bedded into the mortar between two courses of bricks in the wall. A further possibility is coupling to a cavity tray associated with a window in the wall. Whatever method is used, it will be appreciated that the flashing 10 will normally be arranged so that its rear portion 16 lies flush against the wall. Thus the angle between the front and rear portions 12,16 will normally be less than in its free state, so that the portions are resiliently urged against the corrugated roofing sheet and the wall respectively. The upstanding rear portion may have adhesive means for attachment to a wall, e.g. a longitudinal strip of adhesive which is covered by a release paper until required. Although the illustrated embodiment is shaped for use with a corrugated roof of sine wave type crosssection, the invention is not restricted thereto. The term corrugated is used broadly to include any shape having troughs and crests.
