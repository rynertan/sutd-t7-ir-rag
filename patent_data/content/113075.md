# FIELD IMMUNOASSAY REACTION SYSTEM, METHOD OF IMMUNOASSAY DIAGNOSIS AND PROBE OR CARRIER FOR USE THEREWITH

## Abstract
A field immunoassay reaction system and method is provided. The reaction system comprises the following components i a dipstick carrier or probe at least partly coated with monoclonal antibody specific for an antigen con tained in a body substance or fluid ii a plurality of containers iii detergent or other suitable substance to prevent non specific binding of antigen to the monoclonal antibody iv buffer and v in situ signal amplification or detection means.
