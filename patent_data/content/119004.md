# Ring communications system.

## Abstract
A ring communications network has a plurality of terminals coupled together to provide a unidirectional communications ring, each terminal being arranged to receive a first digital signal at a data rate associated with the next upstream terminal in the ring and to transmit a second digital signal at a transmit data rate which may be different from the data rate of the received signal. Each signal comprises data packets interleaved with synchronization packets of elastic length to achieve synchronization around the ring. Thus, each terminal has a synchronizing network 12 containing an electric clock generator 32 having a plurality of outputs each shifted in time by a different multiple of 1 8 times the period of a fixed transmit clock signal generated internally by a transmit clock generator 26 . In effect, synchronization is achieved by a shallow discretely adjusted delay FIFO buffer and sample point readjustment network. The buffer is read at the fixed transmit data rate and loaded at that same rate until the period of elasticity is detected. Then the sample point is reselected to fall in the middle of a transmit bit window effectively changing the FIFO buffer depth.
