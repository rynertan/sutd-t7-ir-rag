# Adjustable orifice for a spray unit.

## Abstract
An assembly for providing a number of different size orifices for a sprayer unit, such as a hand held paint sprayer, has an orifice plate 12 with a number of orifices 17 of different diameters radially disposed near a periphery of the plate. The plate 12 has a centrally disposed pivot pin 13, 14 which is received in a complementary slot 15,16 in the nozzle guard 2 for the sprayer unit. The orifice plate 12 has a like number of detents 23 in the perifphery thereof, and is held in place both within the slot and so as to align one of the orifices with the discharge nozzle for the sprayer unit, by a clip spring 19 having angled free ends 24 respectively received in detents 23 on opposite sides of the orifice plate. Axial movement of the orifice plate is restrained by tighten ing the nozzle guard 2 which is received by threads on the sprayer unit. When a different orifice size is desired, the nozzle guard 2 is loosened, the orifice plate 12 is rotated about the pivot pin 13,14 to position the desired orifice 17 in front of the discharge nozzle, and the nozzle guard 2 is again tightened.
