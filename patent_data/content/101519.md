# METAL VAPOR DISCHARGE LAMP.

## Abstract
A metallic vapor discharge lamp which has an outer tube sealed with a predetermined gas therein, and a light emitting tube including a pair of electrodes mounted in the tube and provided in the discharge space formed therein, with at least a rare gas and mercury sealed into the dis charge space, wherein a lower light transmission cover is provided in the vicinity of the end at the lower position of the end of the light emitting tube, covering at least the lower end of the light emitting tube when it is alight. In this man ner, the temperature reducing action of the lower part of the light emitting tube due to convection in the gas in the outer tube can be suppressed, thereby increasing the tem perature of the coldest part of the light emitting tube to increase the vapor pressure in the light emitting tube suit ably, and thereby improve the efficiency of the lamp.
