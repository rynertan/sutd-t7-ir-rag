# Nickel based catalyst, its preparation and its application.

## Abstract
The invention provides nickel based catalysts suitable for hydrogenation reactions comprising a water soluble, silica containing carrier material amounting to 90 10 parts by weight and 10 90 parts by weight of nickel nickel compound, having an overall active nickel surface of 70 200 mÂ² g, nickel nickel compound aggregates with an average particle size of 2 100 micrometers, which aggregates are for at least 60 , preferably for at least 80 free of carrier particles. The average nickel crystallite size is preferably between 0.5 and 10 nanometers, more preferably between 1 and 3 nano meters. The catalysts can be prepared in a multistep process involving rapid precipitation of nickel compound, an insolu ble carrier and a distinct, much longer ageing step followed by separation of solids, drying and activation.
