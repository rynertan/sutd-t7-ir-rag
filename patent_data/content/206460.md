## Description
The present invention is related to novel enzymes L phenylalanine dehydrogenases, processes for the production thereof, microorganisms producing the new enzyme, and processes for the production of L amino acids using the enzyme. Attempts have been made to produce L amino acids using α ketocarboxylic acid as a substrate. For example, a process for preparing L glutamic acid by adding α ketoglutarate and various kinds of amino acids to microbial cells Katagiri et. al. Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 60 164493 describes a process for the production of L phenylalanine by either culturing one of various kinds of microorganisms with phenylpyruvic acid and an amino group donor, or incubating cells of that microorganism or a treated product of the cells with phenylpyruvic acid and an amino group donor. However, this specifica tion does not disclose just what kind of enzymes partici pate in the reaction. Moreover, such processes employ amino acids, which are an expensive amino group donor. All of the ahove mentioned processes use, as an amino group donor of an aimed amino acid, another amino acid, and are fundamentally different from a process of the present invention which uses an ammonium ion as an amino group donor, which is not so expensive. Namely, the prior art processes are more expensive than the present process. Moreover, the enzymes involved in the prior art process are different from those of the present process. Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 60 43391 discloses a process for production of L amino acid wherein a microorganism capable of convert ing an α keto acid to a corresponding L amino acid is cultured, and during the culturing, the α keto acid is fed into the culturing medium to convert the α keto acid to the L amino acid. According to the reaction mechanism suggested in the specification, as an amino group donor for the formation of an aimed L amino acid from a corresponding α keto acid, L glutamate is used, which means that the reaction is carried out by an amino transferase. Moreover, the application discloses only Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 59 198972 describes L phenylalanine dehydrogenase and a process for the production of L α amino carboxylic acid using that enzyme. However, the L phenylalanine dehydrogenase described therein is derived from Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 60 160890 discloses a process for the production of L phenylalanine by either culturing one of various kinds of microorganisms with phenylpyruvate in the presence of an energy source, an inorganic ammonium compound or urea, and oxygen, or by incubating a cultured product of the microorganism or treated product thereof with phenylpyruvate in the presence of an energy source, an inorganic ammonium compound or urea, and oxygen. However, the specification does not suggest the kind of enzymes involved in the process, and the process is supposed to be essentially a fermentation process, due to the necessity for the presence of oxygen. Moreover, the specification does not refer to The present invention provides new enzymes, L phenylalanine dehydrogenases, i.e., L phenylalanine dehydrogenase characterized by, 1 catalyzing a reaction wherein L phenylalanine, NAD , and H₂O react to form phenylpyruvate, NADH and ammonium ion, and a reverse reaction thereof, 2 having a molecular weight of about 290,000 as determined by high performance liquid chromatography and a molecualr weight of about 305,000 as determined by a sedimentation equilibrium method, and exhibiting a sub unit with a molecular weight of about 38,000 to 39,000 as determined by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and 3 acting strongly on L phenyl alanine, but act very weakly on L tryptophan, L tryrosine and L methionine for oxidative deamination L phenyl alanine dehydrogenase characterized by 1 catalyzing a reaction wherein L phenylalanine, NAD and H₂O react to form phenylpyruvate, NADH and ammonium ion, and a reverse reaction thereof, and 2 being produced by a microorganism belonging to the genus The present invention also provides new micro organisms capable of producing the above mentioned enzymes and belonging to the genus The present invention also provides a process for the production of the above mentioned enzymes, comprizing culturing the above mentioned microorganism.

To each of the test tubes, a small amount of soil sample was added, and the test tubes were incubated at 30 C for three days, with shaking. A drop of the cultured broth was then inocu lated to a new medium prepared as above, and culturing was carried out for three days at 30 C with shaking. The second cultured broth was placed on agar plates, which are the above mentioned medium supplemented with 2 agar, in streaks and the agar plates were incubated at 30 C for several days until colonies of micro organisms developed. The colonies were then picked up and inoculated on slant agar media. As above mentioned, many strains were isolated. Next, 200 ml each of the medium with the composition set forth in Table 1 was incorporated to 500 ml conical flasks, and sterilized as above. The strains obtained as above were cultured in the flasks for 24 hours at 30 C, with shaking, to obtain cultured cells. The cells were washed, and then disrupted by ultrasonic treatment. The treated products were centri fuged to obtain supernatants. The supernatants were dialyzed against an 0.01 M phosphate buffer pH 7.0 containing 0.1 mM EDTA and 5 mM 2 mercaptoethanol. The dialyzed supernatants were tested for L phenylalanine dehydrogenare activity as described below. As a result, five strains were obtained which remarkably produce L phenylalanine dehydrogenase. These strains are listed in Table 2. The five above listed strains have bacterio logical characteristics as set forth in Table 3. On the basis of the above mentioned bacteriolo gical properties, and according to the classification criteria described in Bergey s Manual of Determinative Bacteriology, the eighth edition, 1974, the above listed strains were identified as follows Electron micrographs of cells of the strains SCRC R04, SCRC R53b, SCRC R79a, SCRC 101A, and SCRC 114D are shown in Figures 1 to 5, respectively. The above mentioned strains for the present invention may be converted to strains having an enzyme productivity higher than the original strains, according to conventional mutation or selection. Moreover, a gene coding for L phenylalanine dehydrogenase may be cut out and inserted into an appropriate vector such as a plasmid, which may be then used to transform a hetero logous host such as The microorganisms used in the present appli cation can be preserved according to a conventional method, such as on an agar slant medium or by lyophiliza tion. As an agar slant medium, a conventional medium for preservation of microorganism belonging to genus For culturing the above mentioned micro organisms to produce L phenylalanine dehydrogenase, any medium in which the present microorganisms grow may be used. The medium contains, as a nitrogen source, for example, yeast extract, peptone or meat extract, or a mixture thereof. Moreover, the medium may contain, as a carbon source, glucose, starch, or glycerin, etc. Preferably, the medium contains minerals, such as potassium phosphates, sodium chloride, and magnesium sulfate. To stimulate the production of L phenyl alanine dehydrogenase, preferably a small amount of L phenylalanine is added to a medium as an inducer. The amount of L phenylalanine as the inducer varies, depend ing on the composition of a medium used, nature of the microorgansim cultured, etc., and usually is 0.01 to 10 by weight, preferably 0.1 to 1 by weight, on the basis of the medium. The medium may be a solid medium or a liquid medium, but for a large amount of production of the enzyme, the microorganism is cultured in a liquid medium in the aerobic condition achieved by shaking the medium, or agitation and aeration in the medium. The microorgansim is cultured at any temperature at which the microorganism can grow and produce L phenylalanine dehydrogenase. This temperature is preferably 25 C to 45 C. The pH value of the medium is 6 to 9, prefer ably 7 to 10. Culturing usually is carried out for 6 to 48 hours. L phenylalanine is recovered and purified from the cultured broth according to a combination of conventional procedures used for the purification of an enzyme. For example, a cultured broth is centrifuged to collect bacterial cells. The cells are then disrupted by a conventional method such as ultrasonication or Dynomill treatment, and debris eliminated by a conven tional method such as centrifugation or filtration to obtain a supernatant or filtrate containing the aimed enzyme. Further purification, for example, protamine sulfate treatment, streptomycin sulfate treatment, salting out, organic solvent precipitation, absorption chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, gel filtra tion chromatography, and crystallization using, for example, ammonium sulfate or polyethyleneglycol, may be used. Processes for the purification to crystallization of the present enzyme L phenylalanine dehydrogenase are illustrated in Examples 1 to 3. The activity of L phenylalanine dehydro genase is determined according to the following proce dures. 100 µ moles of glycine KCl KOH buffer pH 10.5 , 2.5 µ moles of NAD , 10 µ moles of L phenyl alanine, and an appropriate amount of sample are mixed to a total volume of 1 ml to react the components, and the increase of an amount of NADH is measured according to the increase of absorption at 340 nm. An amount of the enzyme which increases an amount of NADH by 1 µ mole per 1 minute is defined as 1 unit. 100 µ moles of a buffer, 10 µ moles of sodium phenylpyruvate, and an appropriate amount of sample are mixed to a total volume of 1 ml to react the components, and the decrease of an amount of NADH is determined according to the decrease of absorption at 340 nm. An amount of the enzyme which decreases an amount of NADH by 1 µ mole per minute is defined as 1 unit. The rate of reductive amination of the phenylpyruvate is, at an optimum pH, about 5.5 times higher than that of the oxidative deamination of L phenylalanine. Therefore, for the same sample, the unit value determined by the reductive amination method is about 5.5 times higher than the unit value determined by the oxidative deamination method.

The relative rate of converting 4 hydroxyphenypylruvate to L tyrosine is 176 at pH 9.0 relative to the rate of converting phenylpyruvate to L phenylalanine as 100 . NAD is necessary as a coenzyme, and NADP exhibits only about a 2.9 activity relative to NAD . For oxidative deamination, the optimum pH is about 10.6 to 11.3, while for reductive amination, optimum pH is about 9.8 to 10.8, as shown in Fig. 13. After incubation at 30 C for 1 hour, the residual activity is determined for oxidative deamination. As shown in Fig. 14 activity before treatment is 100 , the enzyme is stable at approximately pH 4.0 to 11.3, and especially pH 9 to 11. The enzyme exhibits the highest activity at about 50 C, as shown in Fig. 15.

Needle as shown in figure 19. On the basis of the above mentioned enzymological properties, the L phenylalanine dehydro genases are deemed to be novel. The pesent invention also provides a process for the production of L amino acid from α ketocarboxylic acid involving the L phenylalanine dehydrogenase. The starting α ketocarhoxylic acids are represented by the following general formula II Substituents for the alkyl group included, for example, hydroxyl, methylthio, methyl, and mercapto. The aromatic groups are, in particular, the phenyl and naphthyl groups. Substituents for the aromatic group include, for example, hydroxyl, halogen such as fluoro, chloro, bromo or iodo, vinyl, methoxy, nitro, a lower alkylthio, and a lower alkyl group. These substituents optionally again substituted. From the above mentioned α ketocarboxylic acid, corresponding L amino acids represented by the following general formula I As examples of starting α ketocarboxylic acids, the following compounds are mentioned phenyl pyruvic acid, 4 hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid, 2 fluoro phenylpyruvic acid, 3 fluorophenylpyrovic acid, 4 fluorophenylpyruvic acid, 3,4 difluorophenylpyruvic acid, 2 chlorophenylpyruvic acid, 3 chlorophenylpyruvic acid, 4 chlorophenylpyruvic acid, 3,4 dichlorophenyl pyruvic acid, 4 methylphenylpyruvic acid, 4 vinylphenyl pyruvic acid, 4 methoxyphenylpyruvic acid, 3,4 dimethoxy phenylpyruvic acid, 2,3,4 trimethoxyphenylpyruvic acid, 4 nitrophenylpyruvic acid, 4 di 2 chloroethyl amino phenylpyruvic acid, indolepyruvic acid, α keto γ methyl thiobutyric acid, α keto γ ethylthiobutyric acid, α ketocaproic acid, α ketoisocaproic acid, DL α keto β methylvaleric acid, α ketovaleric acid, α ketoisovaleric acid, α ketobutyric acid, 3 β naphthyl pyruvic acid, 3,4 dimethylphenylpyruvic acid, 3 methoxyphenylpyruvic acid, and α keto γ trifluoromethylbutyric acid. From the above mentioned starting α keto carboxylic acids, the following L amino acids are produced, respectively L phenylalanine, L tyrosine, 2 fluoro L phenylalanine, 3 fluoro L phenylalanine, 4 fluoro L phenylalanine, 3,4 difluoro L phenylalanine, 2 chloro L phenylalanine, 3 chloro L phenylalanine, 4 chloro L phenylalanine, 3,4 dichloro L phenylalanine, 4 methyl L phenylalanine, 4 vinyl L phenylalanine, 4 methoxy L phenylalanine, 3,4 dimethoxy L phenylalanine, 2,3,4 trimethoxy L phenylalanine, 4 nitro L phenyl alanine, 4 di 2 chloroethyl amino L phenylalanine, L tryptophan, L methionine, L ethionine, L norleucine, L leucine, L isoleucine, L norvaline, L valine, α amino L butyric acid, 3 β naphthyl L alanine, 3,4 dimethyl L phenylalanine, 3 methoxy L phenylalanine, and α amino γ trifluoromethylbutyric acid. According to one embodiment of the present process, an α ketocarboxylic acid, NADH and ammonium ion are reacted under the presence of L phenylalanine, dehydrogenase to form a corresponding L amino acid, and the L amino acid is recovered. The forms of the enzyme preparations of L phenylalanine dehydrogenase are not limited. The preparations include, for example, a completely purified enzyme cultured broth containing cells living cells dried cell powders prepared by treating cells with, for example acetone or ethanol disrupted cells partially purified enzyme preparations purified to various purifi cation stages. Moreover, immobilized enzyme preparations, such as immobilized enzyme and immobilized enzyme containing products prepared according to conventional procedures may be used. An amount in a reaction medium of L phenyl alanine dehydrogenase derived from the above mentioned enzyme preparation is not critical, but conveniently is within about 10 to 10,000 units per 1 litter, depending on the nature and amount of substrate α ketocarboxylic acid and other conditions. As a substrate, both α ketocarboxylic acid and its salt may be used. The salts include, for example, sodium salt, potassium salt, lithium salt, and calcium salt, etc. An amount of α ketocarboxylic acid or salt thereof in the reaction medium is not critical, but is conveniently about 1 to 500 g l depending on the concen tration of the enzyme. When the substrate is used in a lower concentration, it can be used as free acid, and when it is used in a relatively high concentration, it may be preferably used as a salt to simplify adjustment of As a source of ammonium ion, an ammonium salt, such as ammonium chloride or ammonium sulfate may be used. Moreover, ammonia gas or a aqueous ammoniun hydroxide may be introduced in the reaction medium to maintain the pH value within a predetermined range. As described above, when an ammonium salt of α keto carboxylic acid is used as a substrate, the salt also serves as a source of ammonium ion. An amount of ammonium ion used is stoichiometric or more, in relation to the mol amount of α ketocarboxylic acid used, and more specifically, about 1 to 100 mol amount in relation to the mol amount of α ketocarboxylic acid used. By increasing an amount of ammonium salt used, the equilibrium of the enzyme reaction involved is forced to the side of L amino acid formation, resulting in an increase in the yield of L amino acid in relation to α ketocarboxylic acid. NADH may be used in an equivalent amount with α ketocarboxylic acid. Since NADH is very expensive, however, from the industrial point of view, in addition to the reaction system wherein α ketocarboxylic acid is reductively aminated with NH₄ and NADH to form L amino acid and NAD , an NADH regenerating system wherein the NAD formed is re reduced to NADH is preferably used. As such an NADH regenerating system, a combination of an enzyme which converts NAD to NADH and a substrate for the reaction, for example, a combina tion of formate dehydrogenase EC 1.2.1.2 and formate, L glutamate dehydrogenase EC 1.4.1.2 and L glutamate, alcohol dehydrogenase EC 1.1.1.1 and ethanol, aldehyde dehydrogenase EC 1.2.1.3 and acetaldehyde, or a combi nation of glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase EC 1.1.1.49 and glucose 6 phosphate may be used. Moreover, the reduc tion of NAD to NADH with hydrogenase EC 1.18.3.1 using molecular hydrogen as an electron donor or the reduction of NAD to NADH accompanied by the oxidation of methyl biologen or dihydrolipoamide with diaphorase EC 1.6.4.3 may be used. Where formate dehydrogenase and formate are used, simultaneously with the reduction of NAD to NADH, formic acid is oxidized to carbon dioxide gas, which is easily eliminated from the reaction system, resulting in the equilibrium of the reaction being forced in the desired direction. Therefore, as the NADH regenerating system, the combination of formate dehydrogenase and formate is especially preferable. Formate dehydrogenase is commercially avail able, or prepared from A concentration of enzyme for the NADH regener ating system varies, depending on a concentration of L phenylalanine dehydrogenase, etc., and is generally a concentration at which NAD is reduced to NADH at a rate corresponding to a rate at which an α ketocarboxylic acid is reductively aminated, i.e., NAD is formed. For example, where formate dehydrogenase is used as an enzyme for the NADH regenerating system in combination with 10 to 10,000 units ℓ of L phenylalanine dehydro genase, the concentration of the formate dehydrogenase is preferably about 10 to 10,000 units ℓ. As a substrate for formate dehydrogenase, a salt of formic acid, such as sodium formate, potassium formate or ammonium formate is conveniently used. An amount of formate is preferably a one to two equivalent amount of the α ketocarboxylate used. Where the NADH regenerating system is used, NAD or NADH may be added to 0.1 to 10 mM, which is a usual physiological concentration. As a reaction medium, water or various kinds of an aqueous solution, for example, an aqueous buffer solution, or an aqueous solution containing an organic solvent such as acetone, acetonitrile, dimethylsulfoxide or dimethylformamide may be used. The buffer solutions include Tris HCl buffer, glycine NaOH buffer, etc. Where the NADH regenerating system is not used, reaction is carried out at a pH suitable for the reductive amination of α ketocarboxylic acid by the L phenylalanine dehydrogenase used. L phenylalanine dehydrogenase derived from Reaction temperature is selected under the same consideration as for the selection of the pH range. The reaction temperature is usually 20 C to 50 C, preferably 25 C to 40 C. The reaction term is not critical, and is se lected so that a substrate α ketocarboxylic acid is con verted to a product L amino acid by satisfactory conver sion ratio, depending on the concentration of the sub strate and amount of enzymes present in the reaction medium. The reaction may be carried out batch wise or continuously. According to another embodiment of the present process, a substrate α ketocarboxylic acid is converted to a product, i.e., corresponding L amino acid, in the presence of a growing culture such as a medium containing living cells, living cells separated from cultured broth, cells treated to an extent wherein an enzyme system necessary for the conversion of α ketocarboxylic acid to L amino acid is not destroyed, and in the pre sence of an energy source, without the artificial addition of NADH, NAD and the NADH regeneration system. The energy source is added in a reaction medium. The energy sources may act as an electron donor for reductive amination of α ketocarboxylate. The energy sources include, for example, sugars such as arabinose, ribose, ribulose, xylose, fucose, rhamnose, fructose, galactose, gluconate, trehalose, glucose, mannitol, mannose, sorbitol, sorbose, inositol, lactose, maltose, sucrose, raffinose, glycerine, starches, inulin, glycogen, carboxymethylcellulose, and the like. Moreover, the energy sources include alcohols such as ethanol and methanol, organic acids such as propionic acid, acetic acid, formic acid, citric acid, pyruvic acid, succinic acid, malic acid, α keto glutaric acid, and the like. For the second embodiment, the reaction medium, reaction pH, reaction temperature, and other conditions are selected as described for the first embodiment. The second embodiment also does not require the aerobic condition. L amino acid thus formed is recovered and purified according to any conventional procedure. For example, the reaction mixture is added with trichloro acetic acid to precipitate protein and the precipitate, if any, as well as the cells, is eliminated by filtration or centrifugation to obtain a filtrate or supernatant containing the product L amino acid. The product in the filtrate or supernatant is then purified by, for example, ion exchange resin, and finally crystallized. A quantitative analysis of L amino acids is carried out by bioassay using, for example, The present invention will now be further illus trated by, but is by no means limited to, the following examples. 30 ℓ of a medium containing 0.2 L phenylalanine, 0.5 yeast extract, 1.0 peptone, 0.2 H₂HPO₄ , 0.1 NaCl and 0.02 MgSO₄ 7H₂O pH 7.0 was sterilized at 120 C for 15 minutes, and after cooling, inoculated with These active fractions were combined and the combined active fraction was dialyzed against 0.01 M phosphate buffer containing 0.1 mM EDTA and 5 mM 2 mercaptoethanol, and the dialyzate was applied to a hydroxyapatite column previously equilibrated with the same buffer.
