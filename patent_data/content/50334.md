The transformation 2as 22 Diagram I is conveniently carried out using both protected and unprotected HSR8 forms. It is recognized that SR8 side chains in which the R8 group contains one or more chiral centers can be added as racemic or diastereomeric mixtures to provide mixtures of diastereomeric products or can be added as resolved, isomerically pure reagents to provide diastereomerically pure products. Since antibacterial activity and other pharmacological properties vary among isomers, it is frequently advantageous to prepare isomerically pure products by the introduction of resolved SR8 side chains.

In the foregoing word description of the above schematic reaction diagram for the total synthesis of the defined carbapenem antibiotics, it is to be understood that there is considerable latitude in selection of precise reaction parameters. Suggestion of this latitude and its breadth is generally indicated by the enumeration of equivalent solvent systems, temperature ranges, protecting groups, and range of identities of involved reagents. Further, it is to be understood that the presentation of the synthetic scheme as comprising distinct steps in a given sequence is more in the nature of a descriptive convenience than as a necessary requirement for one will recognize that the mechanically dissected scheme represents a unified scheme of synthesis and that certain steps, in actual practice, are capable of being merged, conducted simultaneously, or effected in a reverse sequence without materially altering the progress of synthesis. The following examples recite a precise scheme of total synthesis. It is to be understood that the purpose of this recitation is to further illustrate the total synthesis and not to impose any limitation. Temperature is in C. EXAMPLE 1 This example and those depending from it demonstrate the so called carbamimidoyl embodiments of I. As defined above, such carbamimidoyl embodiments are characterized by the following generic representation EMI52.1 wherein R8, characterized by the carbamimidoyl group, is defined above. The following diagram summarizes the foregoing text, and is illustrative of a preferred procedure for making the carbamimidoyl embodiments.In the following scheme, the synthesis shows a subgeneric objective, since it is representative of the entire carbamimidoyl genus. Other subgeneric expressions and species members of the carbamimidoyls are obtained by analogy EMI53.1 wherein all symbols are as previously defined. The activation step, A B, which establishes the leaving group Xa is accomplished by acylating the keto ester A with an acylating agent such as, for example, p toluenesulfonic acid anhydride, trifluorometanesulfonic acid anhydride, p nitrophenylsulfonic acid anhydride, 2,4,6 triisopropylphenylsulfonic acid anhdride, methanesulfonic acid anhydride, diphenylchlorophosphate, toluenesulfonyl chloride, p bromophenylsulfonyl chloride, or the like. The leaving group thus is established as the corresponding p toluenesulfonyloxy, p nitrophenylsulfonyloxy, methanesulfonyloxy, p bromophenylsulfonyloxy, diphenylphosphoryl ,for example.Typically, the activation is carried out in a suitable organic solvent such as methylene chloride, chloroform, acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran, and the like, in the presence of a base such as diisopropylethylamine, triethylamine, 4 dimethylaminopyridine, pyridine, and the like at a temperature of from 20 to 400C. The reaction usually is complete in from 0.5 to 5 hours. 5 The carboxyl protecting group R in the keto ester, A, may be any of the well known, readily removable carboxyl protecting groups such as, benzyl, p nitrobenzyl, o nitrobenzy, methoxymethyl, allyl and the like. The carbamimidoylthio side chain, B C, is established by treating the activated keto ester, B, in a solvent such as dioxane, dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, acetonitrite, dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran, hexamethylphosphoramide, and the like, in the presence of an approximately equivalent to excess quantity of the mercaptan reagent of choice in the presence of a base, such as diisopropylamine, triethylamine, pyridine, sodium hydrogen carbonate, potassoium carbonate, and the like. The reaction is run at 40 to 500C and usually is complete in 5 minutes to 10 hours. Such mercaptan reagents are either known or readily prepared by known techniques. The mercaptan reagent may be employed in the form of the free base as described above , a salt such as the hydrochloride, the hydrobromide, the sulfate and the toluenesulfonate, or a nitrogen atom may be protected with a conventional N blocking group such as p nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl. When the mercaptan reagent is in the free base form, the displacement reaction does not require the presence of additional base. The final deblocking step, COD, preferably is carried out by catalytic hydrogenation. Catalysts suitable for the reaction include platinum metals, for example, platinum oxide, Pd C, I d OH 2, Pt C, and the like which are employed with a hydrogen pressure of from 1 to 10 atmospheres at a temperature of from 0 to 25 OC in the presence of a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, water, and the like. The reductive deblocking step is usually carried out in the presence of a buffer such as pH 7 phosphate buffer or pH 7 MOPS NaOH buffer. The reaction usually is complete in from 0.5 to 12 hours.

EXAMPLE 11Preparation of Pharmaceutical Compositions One such unit dosage form is prepared by mixing 120 mg of the compound of Example 4 Compound A with 20 mg of lactose and 5 mg of magnesium stearate and placing the 145 mg mixture into a No. 3 gelatin capsule. Similarly, by employing more of the active ingredient and less lactose, other dosage forms can be put up in No. 3 gelatin capsules, and, should it be necessary to mire more than 145 mg of ingredients together, larger capsules such as compressed tablets and pills can be prepared. The following examples are illustrative of the preparation of pharmaceutical formulations TABLET PER TABLETCompound A 125 mg.Cornstarch, U.S.P. 6 mg.Dicalcium Phosphate 192 mg.Lactose, U.S.P. 190 mg.Magnesium Stearate Balance 800 mg. The active ingredient is blended with the dicalcium phosphate, lactose and about half of the cornstarch. The mixture is then granulated with 15 cornstarch paste 16 mg and rough screened. It is dried at 450C and screened again through No. 16 screens. The balance of the cornstarch and magnesium stearate is added and the mixture is compressed into tablets, approximately 0.5 inch in diameter each weighing 800 mg.
