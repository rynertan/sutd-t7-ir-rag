# Cantilever spring counterbalance hinge assembly for aircraft doors.

## Abstract
A simple, compact, cantilever type spring 31 is mounted on the aircraft body structure 22 and is positioned so as to be deflected from its normally unstressed condition to a stressed state by means of a radially projecting roller mounted on and carried by the body mounted torque tube 35 during at least the final increment of movement of the aircraft door when it is being shifted to its fully opened position so as to store energy in the spring 31 for assisting in closing of the door and counterbalancing the hinge moment attributable to the weight of the door when the door is moving upslope during a door closing operation and for thereby minimizing the exertion of the on board flight attendant who is required to apply torque manually by pulling upwardly and outwardly thereon to overcome the door hinge moment until such time that the door begins its downslope travel about the canted hinge axis 35 . In a modified form of the invention, a second radially projecting roller may be mounted on the body mounted torque tube 35 for deflecting the cantilever type spring 31 in the opposite direction during a portion of the downslope travel of the door during a door closing operation so that the energy stored therein can also provide assistance during the initial stages of door opening operation when the on board flight attendant is required to push the door outwardly and upwardly along an upslope path of movement.
