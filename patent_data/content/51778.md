# A device for vaporization injection in a gas chromatographic column.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a device for vaporization injection in a gas chromatographic column housed in an oven. In order to avoid the drawbacks and problems arising with known vaporization injection techniques above all with samples with solvents, the device comprises a direct on column injector suitable for injecting the liquid sample into the initial zone of a capillary column and capable of pneumatically sealing the injection port at the end of injection between the injector and the gas chromatographic column itself a capillary column length is provided in which vaporization of the injected sample occurs by heating an oven housing said capillary column length, said oven being the same or separate from the oven containing said gas chromatograpnic column.
