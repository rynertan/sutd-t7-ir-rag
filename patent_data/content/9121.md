# Remote docking apparatus.

## Abstract
In the repair of PWR type nuclear steam generators using a remote tooling system, it is necessary to install a tubesheet indexer on the tubesheet 28 in a known loca tion. The remote docking device 200 is a device for facili tating this operation. It comprises a support plate 202 with locking devices 204 mounted theron. The locking devices are capable of being inserted into the tubesheet for suspending the support plate therefrom. A vertical member is attached to the support plate with an attachment mecha nism 222 attached to the vertical member. A remonte access manipulator 52 is capable of being attached to the attachment mechanism so that the vertical member can position the remote access manipulator so that the remote access manipulator can be initially attached to the tubesheet in a well defined manner.
