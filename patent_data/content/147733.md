# APPARATUS FOR APPLYING LIQUID COATINGS

## Abstract
A peristaltic type pump having an intake which may be conveniently connected to a liquid coating source includes an impeller having a pair of rollers. Rotation of the impeller causes the rollers to progressively compress a length of tubing in the pump. This compression creates suction to draw the coating material into the pump and pressure to drive a flow of coating to a handle attached to an applicator. The handle includes flow control devices which may be selectively operated to supply coating to the applicator only as required. During periods of non flow the coating pressure is sensed to deactivate the pump when the pressure exceeds a preselected limit. Deactivation of the pump saves energy and prolongs a life of the pump.
