# Fault tolerant communications controlller system.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a system for controlling multiple communications lines, so that a computer system can operate with a single component failure. Two processors are used to control two communications controllers and each of the controllers control up to 15 line controllers. Each line controller has two ports and each port is connected to a communicating controller thereby providing two communi cations paths to each processor. Two power supplies are also used to provide single failure fault tolerance. Additionally, the disclosure relates to providing a down loadable microprocessor board in combination with, but separate from, an interface board that is designed to meet various communication format specifications and the line controller comprises the two boards. The use of a single microprocessor board improves produceability, maintain ability and diagnostic capabilities.
