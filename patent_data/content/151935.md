# Starting device.

## Abstract
A starting device for an automobile motor in which an asynchronous motor 23 is used both as starting motor and generator. A number of solid state switches 10 , forming part of an inverter, is arranged on a metal bar 7 extending along the stator 4 of the motor. The metal bar is connected to one terminal of a voltage supply 21 . The stator conduits 9 are connected to a solid state switch and to the other terminal of the voltage supply.
