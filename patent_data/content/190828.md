# Improvements in self energising disc brakes.

## Abstract
In a disc brake of the spreading type, angular movement of the pressure plates 5, 6 to apply the brake is effected by a brake applying member 21 which co operates with at least one of the balls 8 comprising a rolling actuator body and located in complementary opposed recess 40 in the two plates. The member 21 may comprise a wedge 21 disposed between a pair of balls 8 and radially displaceable to separate the balls 8 . Alternatively the balls 8 may be received in openings in the inner ends of a pair of toggle links 62, 63 , or in a fitting 93 or other member 96 which can be withdrawn from the brake in a radial direction. In another construction a ball 8 is received in an opening 66 in a bell crank lever 65 of which one arm 68 reacts against one of the pressure plates 5 .
