## Description
CONTINUOUS ROLL BALER This invention relates generally to a type of roll baler that is capable of continuously forming roll bales of crop material while moving across a field without stopping to discharge such bales from the roll baler. The invention also relates generally to a method of continuously forming roll bales of crop material in a roll baler while moving across a field without stopping for discharging such bales from the roll baler. A roll baler and method of this general type are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,045,947 assigned to the same assignee as the present application. The disclosed baler includes a lower bale forming apron and a pair of upper bale forming aprons. The upper bale forming aprons cooperate with the lower bale forming apron to define front and rear bale forming chambers. When a bale started in the front chamber reaches a predetermined size, it is transferred to the rear chamber where it is completed. While the completed roll bale is being wrapped with twine and discharged from the rear chamber, another bale is started in the front chamber. This provides for continuous baling operation. The baler disclosed in U.S.PatentNo. 4,045,947 has not been commercially successful because it is too complex and also too expensive to manufacture when compared to conventional roll balers that have been available for several years. Another drawback of this type of continuous roll baler is also that the roll bales tend to fall apart during the transfer from the front chamber to the rear chamber. Another continuous roll baler is shown and described in European patent no. 0064.117. It is an object of the present invention to provide a continuous roll baler which is simple in design and relatively inexpensive to manufacture and yet enables a continuous roll baling operation which avoids the operating problems encountered with prior art continuous roll balers and which results in a substantially increased output. The present invention provides a baler for forming roll bales of crop material and which comprises lower bale forming means and upper bale forming means which are cooperable with the lower bale forming means for defining a bale starting zone therebetween. The baler according to the invention is characterized in a movable indexing guide member which is associated with the upper bale forming means and which has a home position for guiding the upper bale forming means proximate to the lower bale forming means at the rear of the bale starting zone, and means for moving the indexing guide member from the home position in a substantially circular path of travel when a roll bale started in the bale staring zone reaches a predetermined size. In its preferred embodiment, the roll baler of the present invention comprises only a single movable indexing guide member. Also preferably, the indexing guide member moving means are operable, during the formation of each bale in the baler, to move said single movable indexing guide member from the home position through a full 360 degrees revolution along said substantially circular path of travel, generally about the periphery of each bale being formed, and back to said home position. In its preferred embodiment, the roll baler of the present invention includes a main body portion and an auxiliary body portion pivotally connected to the main body portion for movement between a closed bale forming position and an open bale discharge position. The lower bale forming means are supported on the main body portion and the upper bale forming means are supported on the main body portion and the auxiliary body portion. The main body portion includes Åa pair of sidewalls, and the means for moving the indexing guide member include a pair of disks disposed inside the main body portion closely adjacent and parallel to the pair of sidewalls. The pair of disks are rotatably mounted on the pair of sidewalls, and the indexing guide member is connected between the pair of disks at a location radially outwardly from the rotary axis of the disks. The upper bale forming means comprise a lower span which is expandable in length around the periphery of a roll bale during formation thereof in the baler. The movable indexing guide member, when in the home position, is located rearwardly of said lower span and is movable from the home position along said substantially circular path of travel toward a position situated forwardly of said lower span extending around the periphery of the roll bale being formed. The roll baler of the present invention also includes drive means engaging the peripheral edges of the pair of disks for rotating the pair of disks in a direction to cause movement of the indexing guide member as already said. The drive means comprise sprockets adapted for engagement with teeth formed on the peripheral edges of the discs. The sprockets are connected by a cross shaft and an electric clutch and brake device is coupled to one end of said crop shaft. The electric clutch and brake device is selectively operable either as a clutch to allow the shaft, the sprockets and the disks to be rotated or as a brake to hold the shaft, the sprockets and the disks stationary. According to another aspect of the present invention, a method is provided for forming roll bales of crop material in a baler having upper and lower bale forming means cooperating to define a bale starting zone a drive member associated with the upper bale forming means for moving said upper bale forming means in a direction to roll crop material into a roll bale in the bale starting zone and an indexing guide member associated with the upper bale forming means and having a home position for guiding said upper bale forming means proximate to the lower bale forming means at the rear of the bale starting zone. The method according to the invention is characterized in the steps of engaging the drive member with a power source to move the upper bale forming means in said direction to start a first roll bale in the bale starting zone holding the indexing guide member in its home position during the formation of the first roll bale in the bale starting zone moving the indexing guide member from the home position in a substantially circular path of travel when the first roll bale reaches a predetermined size returning the indexing guide member to the home position after one full 360 degrees revolution along the generally circular path of travel for reforming the bale starting zone and holding the indexing guide member in the home position again while simultaneously discharging the first roll bale from the baler and starting a second roll bale in the reformed bale starting zone. Preferably the method according to the invention also comprises the step of wrapping the first bale in the baler with wrapping material while starting the second bale in the reformed bale starting zone and prior to discharging said first roll bale from the baler. The method also includes the steps of continueing to add crop material to the first roll bale in the baler while moving the indexing guide member from the home position less than one full 360 degrees revolution along the substantially circular path of travel to another position stopping the adding of crop material to the first roll bale in the baler when moving the indexing guide member from the another position back to the home position, and subsequently initiating the formation of the second roll bale in the reformed bale forming zone while holding the indexing guide member again in the home position. The preferred method according to the invention is also characterized in the further steps of disengaging the drive member from the power source when the first roll bale is being completed and when the indexing guide member has been moved from the home position to the another position less than one full 360 degrees revolution along the substantially circular path of travel, and re engaging the drive member with the power source when the indexing guide member has been moved from said another position back to the home position thereby completing said full 360 degrees revolution. Preferably said another position of the indexing guide member is located part of the way along the substantially circular path of travel and adjacent the drive member for the upper bale forming means. A continuous roll baler constructed in accordance with the present invention and a method of continuously forming roll bales of crop material with this roll baler will now be described in greater detail, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a side view of a roll baler embodying the present invention as a roll bale is being started Fig. 2 is a side view of the roll baler of Fig. 1 when a roll bale of predetermined diameter has been formed Fig. 3 is a side view of the roll baler of Fig. 1 during completion of a roll bale Fig. 4 is another side view of the roll baler of Fig.1 as a roll bale is being completed Fig. 5 is a side view of the roll baler of Fig. 1 when one roll bale has been completed and another roll bale is being started and Fig. 6 is a side view of the roll baler of Fig. 1 during discharge of a completed roll bale. In the following description, right hand and left hand references are determined by standing at the rear of the machine and facing in the direction of forward travel. Also, it is to be understood that such terms as forward , rearward , left , right , upwardly , etc. are words of convenience and are not to be construed as limiting terms. Referring to Fig. 1, a roll baler 10 subject of the present invention is similar to the type disclosed in U.S.Patent No. 3,914,926 incorporated herein by reference. The type of baler disclosed in this patent has been manufactured and sold by the Gehl Company as Model Nos. 1400 and 1600. The roll baler 10 includes a main body portion or frame 12 supported by a pair of wheels 14, and an auxiliary body portion or tailgate 16. A tongue 18 is provided on the frame 12 for connection to a tractor. A pickup device 20 mounted on the frame 12 includes a plurality of tines 22 rotatable about a shaft 23 for engaging and picking up crop material arranged in windrows on the ground. The frame 12 includes a pair of sidewalls 13 which are vertically oriented and transversely spaced apart. The tailgate 16 includes a pair of side members 17 rigidly connected together by cross members not shown . The side members 17 of the tailgate 16 are pivotally connected by stub shafts 24 to the sidewalls 13 of the frame 12. A pair of hydraulic cylinders 26 are connected between the sidewalls 13 of the frame 12 and the side members 17 of the tailgate 16 for moving the tailgate 16 between the closed position shown in Fig. 1 and the open position shown in Fig. 6. Lower bale forming means such as a conveyor 28 in the form of an endless belt extend between the sidewalls 13 of the frame 12 and are supported on front and rear rollers 30 and 32, respectively, which are rotatably carried on the frame 12.The upper run 29 of the conveyor 28 is supported between the front and rear rollers 30,32 by intermediate rollers 34 and 36 which are also rotatably carried on the frame 12. A press roller 38 extends between and is supported on the sidewalls 13 of the frame 12 directly above the front roller 30 of the conveyor 28 to compress incoming crop material into a mat. The press roller 38 and the front roller 30 of the conveyor 28 are connected by conventional drive means not shown , such as chains and sprockets, to the power take off unit PTO of a tractor in a manner to cause rotation of the press roller 38 and the conveyor front roller 30 in the directions indicated in Fig. 1. The upper run 29 of the conveyor 28 moves rearwardly from the front roller 30 to the rear roller 32. A plurality of guide members or rollers 40,42,44 and 46 extend between and are rotatably supported on the sidewalls 13 of the frame 12. Another plurality of guide members or rollers 48,50,52,54,56 and 58 extend between and are rotatably supported on the side members 17 of the tailgate 16. Shuttle members 60 are slidably mounted on the sidewalls 13 of the frame 12 for back and forth movement in a substantially horizontal direction near the top of the frame 12. A pair of guide members or rollers 62 and 64 extend between and are rotatably carried by the shuttle members 60. Upper bale forming means preferably comprised of a series of endless belts 66 extend around the aforementioned guide members or rollers in a side by side, transversely spaced apart arrangement between the sidewalls 13 of the frame 12 and also between the side members 17 of the tailgate 16.The rollers 40 and 44 are connected to the PTO of a tractor by drive means not shown in a conventional manner to drive the belts 66 in the direction and along the path indicated in Fig. 1. A conventional clutch mechanism not shown , which may be electrically, mechanically or hydraulically operated, is provided in the drive means not shown to the drive rollers 40 and 44 to enable the drive rollers 40 and 44 to be disengaged from the tractor PTO to interrupt movement of the belts 66. The shuttle members 60 are urged forwardly toward the phantom position shown in Fig. 1 by spring mechanisms not shown to maintain a certain amount of tension in the belts 66. According to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, a pair of disks 68 are disposed inside the frame 12 closely adjacent and parallel to the sidewalls 13 thereof. Each disk 68 is in the form of a flat circular plate. The disks 68 are fixed at their centers to stub shafts 70 which in turn are rotatably mounted in bearing members located in the sidewalls 13 of the frame 12. An indexing guide member in the form of a roller 72 is rotatably connected between the disks 68 at a location radially outwardly from the stub shafts 70. The indexing roller 72 extends transversely of the baler 10. Teeth 74 formed on the peripheral edges of the disks 68 are adapted for engagement with sprockets 76 rotatably mounted on brackets 78 attached to the sidewalls 13 of the frame 12. The sprockets 76 are connected by a cross shaft 80.One end of the cross shaft 80 is coupled to an electric clutch and brake device not shown such as Model No. IXC 931 manufactured by Warner ElectricCorporation. This electric clutch and brake device may be selectively operated as either a clutch to allow the shaft 80 and the sprockets 76 to be rotated or as a brake to hold the shaft 80 and the sprockets 76 stationary. With reference to Fig. 1, it will be seen that the indexing roller 72 is provided inside the loop formed by the endless belts 66 of the upper bale forming means. It also will be seen that, when the indexing roller 72 is in the position shown in Figure 1, called hereafter the home position , the belts pass underneath this indexing roller 72 in close proximity to the upper run 29 of the conveyor 28 so that a lower span 67 of the belts 66 running from the indexing roller 72 to the drive roller 40 moves in substantially the opposite direction as the upper run 29 of the conveyor 28. This relationship between the direction of movement of the lower span 67 of the belts 66 and the direction of movement of the upper run 29 of the conveyor 28 causes crop material to be coiled or wrapped in a manner to effectively start a roll bale. The lower span 67 of the belts 66 is expandable in length during bale formation. During operation, the baler 10 is towed across a field by a tractor. The pickup device 20 delivers crop material between the press roller 38 and the front of the conveyor 28.The upper run 29 of the conveyor 28 carries the crop material rearwardly into a bale starting zone 69 where it is engaged by the lower span 67 of the belts 66 which causes coiling of the crop material and formation of the core of a roll bale. During this stage of bale formation, the electric clutch and brake device not shown on the shaft 80 is operated as a brake so that the disks 68 are held stationary by the sprockets 76 and the indexing roller 72 is located in the home position as shown in Fig. 1 thereby causing the belts 66 to be pinched against the upper run 29 of the conveyor 28 at the rear of the bale starting zone 69. As the bale increases in size , the shuttle members 60 move rearwardly along the top of the frame 12 as shown in Fig.1 against the force of the spring mechanisms not shown . This allows the lower span 67 of the belts 66 to expand around the periphery of the bale. When a bale of predetermined size has been formed, the electric clutch and brake device not shown on the shaft 80 is operated as a clutch so that the sprockets 76 are driven via the shaft 80 thereby causing rotation of the disks 68 in the direction indicated in Fig. 2 and movement of the indexing roller 72 from its home position in a substantially circular path of travel generally about the periphery of the bale. The disks 68 together with the indexing roller 72 thereon are rotated through a full 360 degrees revolution. Initial rotation of the disks 68 moves the indexing roller 72 out of engagement with the belts 66 as seen in Fig. 3 while crop material continues to be added to the bale.When the indexing roller 72 has moved to the position shown in Fig. 4 where it is adjacent the drive roller 40, the bale will have moved slightly rearwardly thereby partially extending into the tailgate 16. At this point, the belts 66 are disconnected from the PTO of the tractor by disengaging the drive means not shown between the drive rollers 40 and 44 and the tractor PTO. This facilitates continued further rotational movement of the indexing roller 72 in a direction opposite to the pull in the belts 66 and from the position proximate to the drive roller 40 shown in Fig. 4 across the bale chamber inlet throat and back to the home position shown in Fig. 5. Thereby the flow of crop material from the pick up device 20 to the bale in the bale forming chamber is interrupted.The belts 66 remain disconnected from the tractorPTO until the disks 68 complete one full 3600 revolution and the indexing roller 72 returns to its home position as shown inFig. 5. In practice, this takes only a very short while and does not necessitate interruption of the forward movement of the roll baler across the field. In other words, the pick up device 20 continues to pick up crop material from the field and deliver it to the press roll 38. As the indexing roller 72 is moved across the throat of the bale chamber, further crop material which is supplied by the pick up device 20, is accumulated in the zone forwardly of the indexing roller 72 and between the upper run 29 of the lower belt 28 and the lower span 67 of the upper belts 66 between the indexing roller 72 and the drive roller 40. This zone is the bale starting zone 69 alreacy described. When the indexing roller 72 is returned to its home position again, the bale starting zone 69 is consequently reformed and the belts 66 are reconnected to the tractor PTO.A new bale is then started in the bale starting zone 69 while the previously completed bale positioned rearwardly of the newly formed bale starting zone 69, is being wrapped in a net or other wrapping material in a conventional manner. Subsequent to this wrapper operation, the tailgate 16 is moved to its open position as shown in Fig. 6 by extending the hydraulic cylinders 26, and the completed bale is discharged. Subsequent to discharging the completed bale from the roll baler 10, the tailgate 16 is moved back to its closed position of Fig. 1 and the baling operation continues without interruption. It will be understood that the present invention is not limited to the particular roll baler 10 which is derived from the roll baler disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,914,926.Accordingly, the present invention may be incorporated in other types of roll balers to form continuous roll balers. From what precedes it will be seen that the invention provides a continuous roll baler which is simple in design and relatively inexpensive to manufacture and yet enables a continuous roll baling operation, which in turn results in a substantially increased output. More specifically, it also will be seen from what precedes that the present invention basically provides a one chamber continuous roll baler, which is in contrast with the prior art continuous roll balers which have two chambers of one form or another See e.g. EP, 0.064.117 . In the baler according to the instant invention, a single bale starting chamber or zone 69 is provided which grows together with a bale being formed therein till the said bale reaches its desired maximum size. Once the bale is completed, i.e. reaches its full size, the bale forming chamber or zone is relocated in an ingenious manner and returns to its original or starting dimension and shape forwardly of the completed bale, which still is held in the baler for a short while. This is sufficient for wrapping said bale with a wrapping material of any type. While, as already said, the baler subject of the invention basically is a one chamber continuous roll baler, it is also noted that the design thereof nevertheless allows two chambers to be formed and maintained for a short while during the bale formation. Indeed, a full size bale chamber is maintained alongside and together with the relocation or reformation of the bale starting zone or chamber in its original shape and dimension during the period of time from the moment the bale reaches its full size until it is being discharged following the wrapping thereof in the machine. This period of time is only a fraction of the time needed for forming a roll bale. The following claims are intended to cover all modifications and variations of the preferred embodiment of the present invention disclosed herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
