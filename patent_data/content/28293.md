# Complementary transistor emitter follower circuit.

## Abstract
An emitter follower series connected pair of complemen tary transistors 2,3 provide an output signal at the junction 20 between their commonly connected emitters. The NPN transistor 2 of the pair of transistors 2,3 is directly driven by an input signal applied to its base. The PNP transistor 3 of the pair of transistors 2,3 is driven through a series connection ofa NPN transistor 1 and a Schottky diode 4 , the base of the NPN transistor 1 also receiving said input signal. The for ward voltage of the Schottky diode 4 is less than the voltage V
