# Pyrazolo magenta couplers used in silver halide photography.

## Abstract
A magenta forming photographic coupler is a pyrazolo triazolo of general formula. 72 specific couplers are shown, and six synthesis methods. The coupler may be in a silver halide emulsion layer of a photographic material or in a primary amine color developing solution. The material may include other magenta couplers, and or a phenoxy derivative as a dye stabilizer. Color development produces good magenta image free from subsidiary yellow absorptions.
