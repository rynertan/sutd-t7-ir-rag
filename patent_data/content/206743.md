# ZERO FALL THROUGH TIME ASYNCHRONOUS FIFO BUFFER WITH NONAMBIGUOUS EMPTY FULL RESOLUTION

## Abstract
A First In First Out shift register memory system 10 with a plurality of memory word registers 50 having data inputs connected to a common data in bus 16 , and a plurality of data outputs connected to a common data out bus 22 . A read address ring counter 36 and write address ring counter 32 are responsive to respective read and write pulses to se quentially perform memory read and write operations. A com parator 40 compares the address outputs of the ring counters 36,32 for equality. A read and a write signal generator 80, 60 are provided for producing respective read and write pulses in response to input transitions of read and write commands. A last operation R W flip flop 70 maintains an account of the last read and write memory operation processed by the system. Read and write enable latches 90,66 are responsive to the comparator 40 output indication of address equality, and responsive to the last operation R W flip flop 70 output indication of the last memory operation to prevent the reading of the memory 48 by read pulses when empty, and the writing of the memory 48 by write pulses when full.
