In the compound of fornula 2 above, R3 is any substituent which is non reactive under the reaction conditions. Examples are lower alkyl groups with 1 to 4 carbon atoms, lower alkoxy groups with 1 to 4 carbon atoms, aromatic groups with 6 to 10 carbon atoms, a hydroxyl group, a nitro group, and halogen atoms such as chloro. Specific examples of the compound of formula 2 include 3 amino 2 cyclohexenone, 3 amino 2 methyl 2cyclohexenone, 3 amino 5 methyl 2 cyclohexenone, 3 amino5,5 dimethyl 2 cyclohexenone, 3 amino 2,6 dimethyl 2cyclohexenone, 3 anino 4 phenyl 2 cy c lohexenon e, 3 anino 5 phenyl 2 cycloEzexenone, 3 amino 6 phenyl 2 cyclohexenone, 3 amino 2 bromo 5,5 dimethyl 2 cyclohexenone, and 3 amino2 nitro 5,5 dimethyl 2 cyclohexenone.

Of these, the monohydric primary lower alcohols such as nethanol or ethanol are especially preferred. The reaction is suitably carried out at a tem perature of, say, about 0 to about 200 C, preferably from room temperature to about 150 C. In the reaction, at least 1 mole cf the water or the Cl ClO mono or dihydric alcohol is used per mole of the starting compound of formula 2 . For example, the water or alcohol is used in an amount of about 1 to about 100 moles per mole of the conpound of formula 2 . If desired, a solvent can be used in the reaction, but is not essential in the process of this invention. Rather, the absence of solvent is preferred to facilitate the operation of separating the desired product. Usable solvents may include benzene and toluene. The reaction time can be varied according to the reaction temperature and the use or non use of catalyst. For example, it is from about 0,1 to about 10 hours. The rate of the reaction in the process of this invention can be greatly increased by performing the reaction in the presence of a catalyst, and this is re ferred because the selectivity for the cyciohexane l,3 diones or 3 alkoxy 2 cyclohexenones can be increased.Basic catalysts and acid catalysts are preferred catalysts0Examples of the basin catalysts include alkali metal hydroxides such as lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide alkali metal oxides such as lithium oxide, sodium oxide and potassium oxide alkali mental alkoxides such as lithium methoxide, lithium ethoxide, sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, sodium propoxide, potassium ethoxide, potassium isopropoxide and potassium butoxide alkaline earth metal hydroxides such as magnesium hydroxide calcium hydroxide, strontium hydroxide and barium hydroxide and basic organic compounds such as trimethylamine, triethylamine, tri n propylamine, triisopropylamine, tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide, tetraethyl ammonium hydroxide, trimethyl benzyl ammonium hydroxide, triethyl benzyl amnioniuni hydroxide, triisopropyl benzyl ammonium hydroxide aiid diazabicycloundecane.Of these basic catalysts, t.ze alkali metal containing basic compounds are especially preferred. Examples of the acid catalyst are inbrganic compounds such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid hydriodic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, perchloric acid, phosphoric acid, monophosphates, diphosphates, carbonic acid, carbon dioxide and ammonium hydrogen sulfate and organic compounds such as formic acid, acetic acid, monochloroacetic acid, dichloroacetic acid, trichloroacetic acid and p toluenesulfonic acid. Of these acid catalysts, strongly acid compounds such as sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid are especially preferred. The amount of the catalyst is not critical, and may, for example, be about 0.1 to about 10 gram equiva lents, preferably about I to about 2 gram equivalents, per mole of the 3 substituted or unsubstituted amino 2 cyclohexenon e. After the reaction, the compound of formula 1 can be separated by applying such means as distillation or crystallization to the reaction mixture. The starting 3 substituted or unsubstituted amino 2 cyclohexenone used in the performance of this invention may be produced by any desired process. For example, it can be produced by the process disclosed in JapanesePatent Publication No. 34859 73 corresponding to GermanOLS 2144169 and 2144170 which comprises cyclizing a cyanoethylated ketone in a polar solvent in the presence of a basic catalyst at a temperature of about 20 to about 150 C. In particular, 3 amino 2 cyclohexenone can be produced in good conversion and selectivity by the following process developed by the present inventors which involves the heat cyclization of 5 oxohexanenitrile which is readily synthesized from acetone and acrylonitrile.Specificaily this process comprises heating 5 oxohexanenitrile of the formula EMI7.1 at a temperature a of about 160 C to about 220 C in the presence of a basi catalyst in an inert organic polar solvent.Specific examples of the solvent used in this process in dude alcohols containing 1 to 6 carbon atoms such as methanol, ethanol, n propanol, isopropanol, n butanol, sec butanol, tert butanol, pentanol, tert amylalcohol, and hexanol ethers containing 4 to 14 carbon atoms such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, diglyme and triethylene glycol dimethyl ether nitrides containing 1 to 3 carbon atoms such as acetonitrile and propionitrile amines contain ng 3 to 8 carbon atoms such as trimethylamine, triethyamine, pyridine and a picoline dialkyl formainides witl the alky group containing 1 or 2 carbon atoms such as dimethylformamide and diethylformamidei phosphoric acid asides such as hexamethylphosphoric triamide and sulfoxides such as dimethyl sulfoxide. Of these, tertiary alcohols, especially tert butanol, are preferred. Mixtures of t wo or more of these organic polar solvents, and mixtures of them with organic non polar solvents can also be used.Examples of the organic nonpolar solvents are aliphatic hydrocarbons such as hexane, heptane, octane, nonage and decane ard aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, tcluene and p xylene. The amount of the organic polar solvent can be used in an amount such that the weight ratio of it to the 5 oxohexanenitrile is from 1 1 to 1000 1, preferably from 5 1 to 200 l. Specific examples of the basic catalyst used in the above process are alkali metal hydroxides such as potassium hydroxide and sodium hydroxide alkali metal alkoxides such as potassium methoxide, potassium ethoxide, potassium propoxides and potassium butoxides and the corresponding sodium alkoxides alkali metal amides such as sodium amide and potassium amide alkali metal hydrides such as sodium hydride and alkali metals such as sodium and potassium. Of these basic catalysts, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, potassium alkoxides, and sodium alkoxides are preferred. Potassium hydroxide and potassium alkoxides are especially preferred. The amount of the basic catalyst can be varied widely. Usually, it is about 0.001 to about 1 mole, preferably about 0.005 to about 0.2 mole, per mole of the starting 5 oxohexanenitrile. The heat cyclization rection is carried out at a temperature of about 160 to about 220 C, preferably about 170 to about 200 0C. If the heating temperature is lower than about 1600C, the conversion of the 5 oxohexanenitrile decreases, and its selectivity for 6 methyl 3,4 dihydro 2 pyridone, a by product, increases abruptly, thus causing a reduction in the selectivity for 3 amino 2 cyclohexanone and its yield. On the other hand, if the heating temperature exceeds about 220 C, the selection for the by product 6 methyl 3,4 dihydro 2 pyridone increases, and 3 amino 2 cyclohexenone which has been formed may be consumed by a secondary reaction.Hence, the selection for 3 amino 2 cyclollexenone and its yield decrease.By maintaining the heating temperature at 170 to 2000C, the selectivity for 3 amino 2 cyclohexenone and its yield can be increased further. The above process can be performed either batchwise, semicontinuously or continuously. When 5 oxohexanenitrile is fully diluted with a solvent in the aforesaid process, the formation of the by product 6 methyl 3,4 dihydro 2 pyridone can be inhibited to some extent, and the selectivity for 3 amino 2 cyclohexenone can be increased.Accordingly, it is preferred to use the solvent in an amount which is as excessive as is commercially permissible.It is preferred that the reaction be carried out under conditions such that the concentration of the starting 5 oxohexanenitrile in the reaction system does not exceed about 0.5 molezliter, for example, under such conditions that the concentration of the 5 oxohexanenitrile is about 0.1 to about 0.5 mole liter of solvent. The reaction time is not critical, either, and may, for example, be about 0.5 to about 4 hours, The selectivity for 3 amino 2 cyclohexenone can thus be increased if 5 oxohexanenitrile is added to the reaction systen so that the concentration of the unreacted 5 oxohexanenitrile in the reaction solution does not exceed 0.5 mole. iter. After the reaction, the reaction mixture is treated in a customary manner such as distillation or crystallization to separate 3 amino 2 cyclohexenone. Thus, according to one preferred embodiment of this invention, there is provided a process for producing a cyclohexane 1,3 dione or 3 alkoxy 2 cyclohexenone of the formulaEMI9.1 wherein R represents 0 or ORê in which when R is 0, the bond between th 2 a 3 positions re presents a carbon carbon single bond, and when R is P2, that bond between the 2 and 3 position represents a carbon carbon double bond and 2 represents a residual moiety of a monohydric or dihydric alcohol having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, which comprises heating 5 oxohexanenitrile of the formulaEMI10.1 at a temperature of about 160 C to about 2200C in the pre sence of a basic catalyst in an inert organic polar solvent to form 3 amino 2 cyclohexenone of the formulaEMI10.2 and reacting the resulting 3 amino 2 cyclohexenone with water or a monohydric or dihydric alcohol having 1 to 10 carbon atoms.
