# Process for preparing Zn Fe base alloy electroplated steel strips.

## Abstract
Steel strips are electroplated with a Zn Fe base alloy containing 10 to 30 by weight of iron in a chloride bath which contains zinc and ferrous chlorides to give a total concentration of zinc and ferrous ions of from 1.0 mol l to the solubility limit with a weight ratio of Fe² Zn² between 0.10 and 0.35, and chloride ions in a total concentration of at least 6.0 mol l under electrolytic conditions pH 1.0 6.0, current density 80 200 A dm², and relative flow velocity 30 200 m min. The bath may further contain a polycarboxylic acid such as citric acid and a Zn Fe P alloy plating may be deposited when the bath further contain hypophosphorous acid.
