## Description
The invention relates to a mooring system comprising a column ex tending under tension between a connecting point adjacent to the sea bottom and a point located adjacent to the water level,which column has bending vibration modes between the said points with associated period. Mooring systems of this type are known in many embodiments. By choosing a suitable length for the column they can be used in different water depths. Said length of the column, in combination with among others the rigidity against bending and the distribution of the masses of the column, influences the vibration behaviour of the mooring system. In combination with the periodical loads resulting from the wave move ments of the sea, this behaviour is determining for the occurance or non occurance of resonance. To avoid resonance it is necessary to fulfil the requirement that the periods of the bending vibrations of the column lie outside the area of the wave periods of the sea water. In this respect mainly the lowest bending vibrations are important. With relatively long columns the problem occurs that the lowest bending vibrations have periods which lie within the area of the wave periods. This could be avoided by dividing the column into parts which are pivotably connected with each other vide e.g. U.S. patent specifi cation 4,280,238 , but in particular with larger water depths it is undesirable to provide the column with pivotable joints. Purpose of the invention is to provide a mooring system having a relatively long column out of one piece of which the period of the lowest bending vibration or vibrations cannot generate resonance. If said period is indicated with N, in which N 1 could be,then the period N 1 might be in the area of the smallest wave periods. According to the invention this purpose is achieved in that an ad ditional mass or masses respectively is or are coupled with the column at the location or locations respectively of the vibration mode or modes respectively of the N 1 bending vibration of the column. This additional mass or masses has or have to be calculated such in relation to the length of the column and the periods of large and smaller waves of the wave pattern to be expected at the location of the mooring system, that the period of the N Moreover a buoy can be rigidly connected to the column. The steel mass of the buoy then forms the additional mass. Said embodiment has an additional advantage that the buoyancy of the buoy performs a tensile force upon the portion of the column located below the buoy. According to a preferred embodiment the additional mass or masses is or are formed by a water mass present between the outer wall of the column and a sleeve surrounding the column and connected with the column. Said sleeve can have any shape suitable to hold the water inside it with respect to the column during displacements resulting from bending vibrations. According to a preferred embodiment the upper and lower end of the sleeve could be in fully open connection with the surrounding water. Moreover the sleeve can be made narrower towards its outer ends. Throttle openings may be provided to generate a dampening function. The additional mass or masses respectively can be formed by a filling of the column, such as a local ballast mass. Said mass can be formed by concrete or other heavy material but can be formed as well by a space to be filled with water. The outer dimensions such as the diameter of the column then need not to be changed. Said additional mass also can be formed by and or be present in a portion of larger outer dimensions than the dimensions of the column. By the larger outer dimensions a larger mass is already form ed and larger flow resistances are generated as well, which space, if desired, further can be provided with an additional mass. In the following the invention now will be further elucidated with reference to the drawings. Figure 1 shows the mooring system with reference 1. It comprises a column 2 connected at its lower end upon the sea bottom 4 by means of a ball joint 3 and at its upper end by means of a cardan joint 5. Said cardan joint forms part of an arm 6 with buoyant body 7 connect ed to a tanker 8. The first bending vibration 9 and the second bending vibration 10 are schematically indicated. Figure 2 shows how at the level of the central vibration node of the second bending vibration a sleeve 11 has been mounted around the column 2. Between said sleeve and the column there is a water mass 12 forming the additional mass. Figure 3 shows a column provided at said location with a concre te mass 13. A diameter of the column 2 has not been changed by it. Figure 4 shows an embodiment in which the column 2 at the loca tion of the vibration node of the second bending vibration has been provided with a thickening 14 which may be or may be not filled with an additional mass. Figure 5 shows that the column 15 with the additional mass 16 can be suspended from a vessel 17, can be loaded by a weight 18 and with its lower end 19 located adjacent to the sea bottom be anchored by means of chains 20. With said embodiment the column is held under tension by the weight 18. Figure 6 schematically shows a column 21 with the additional mass 22, which column has been positioned in the sea bottom at 23. In this embodiment the column is loaded undercompression. Figure 7 shows the application of the invention with a construc tion comprising e.g. three supporting legs 24 which at 25 are placed upon the sea bottom and at the top are interconnected by means of a body 26 extending through the water level. Here the masses are pro vided at 27. With said construction the load is general under compression from a deckload 28.
