# Improved fuel cell generators.

## Abstract
A high temperature solid electrolyte fuel cell generator 60 comprising a housing means 62 defining a plurality of chambers including a generator chamber 64 and a combus tion products chamber 66 , a porous barrier 80 separating the generator 64 and combustion product chambers 66 , a plurality of elongated annular fuel cells 86 each having a closed end 90 and an open 88 with the open ends 88 disposed within the combustion product chamber 66 , the cells 86 extending from the open end 88 through the porous barrier 80 and into the generator chamber 64 , a conduit 92 for each cell 86 , each conduit 92 extending into a portion of each cell 86 disposed within the generator chamber 64 , each conduit 92 having means for discharg ing a first gaseous reactant within each fuel cell 86 , exhaust means for exhausting the combustion product chamber 66 , manifolding means 82 for supplying the first gaseous reactant to the conduits 92 with the manifolding means 82 disposed within the combustion product chamber 66 between the porous barrier 80 and the exhaust means 76 and the manifolding means 82 further comprising support and bypass means for providing support of the manifolding means 82 within the housing 62 while allowing combus tion products from the first and a second gaseous reactant to flow past the manifolding means 82 to the exhaust means 76 , and means 72 for flowing the second gaseous reactant into the generator chamber 64 .
