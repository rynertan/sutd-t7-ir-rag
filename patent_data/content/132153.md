# RADIANT HEATERS

## Abstract
A radiant heater comprises first and second reflector por tions 1, 2 first and second side reflector plates 3, 4 first and second end reflector plates 5, 6 first and second steel U tubes 7, 8 received by the first and second portions 1, 2 respectively end reflector plates 9, 11 for the reflector por tions 1 and end reflector plates 10, 12 for the reflector portion 2 , the ends of the tube 7 protruding through the plate 9 and the ends of the tube 8 protruding through the plate 10 first and second gas or oil burners and control units 13, 14 communicating with the ends of the tubes 7, 8 respectively nearer a V shaped channel and first and second suction fan units 16, 17 communicating with the ends of tubes 7, 8 respectively which are further from the channel 15 . In use of the heater, gas or oil is burnt at the burners and control units 13, 14 , and air is sucked through the tubes 7, 8 by the suction fan units 16, 17 . The provision of two U tubes 7, 8 provides for a greater heat output than with the use of a single tube for a given length of heater and the provision of side reflector plates 3, 4 end reflector plates 5, 6, 9, 11, 10, 12 and the V shaped channel 15 results in a reduced and more uniform spread of heat radiated by the tubes 7, 8 meaning that the heater may be disposed a greater height above ground to give a useful heating effect at ground level compared with a conventional radiant heater. Also, the overall shape of the radiant heater is such as to restrict the loss of heat due to convection.
