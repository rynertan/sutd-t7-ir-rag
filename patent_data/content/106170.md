## Description
The present invention relates generally to the manipulation of genetic materials and, more particularly to the use of recombinant procedures to secure the production of polypeptides possessing one or more biochemical and immunological properties of growth hormones of avian species. Genetic materials may be broadly defined as those chemical substances which program for and guide the manufacture of constituents of cells and viruses and direct the responses of cells and viruses. A long chain polymeric substance known as deoxyribonucleic acid DNA comprises the genetic material of all living cells and viruses except for certain viruses which are programmed by ribonucleic acids RNA . The repeating units in DNA polymers are four different nucleotides, each of which consists of either a purine adenine or guanine or a pyrimidine thymine or cytosine bound to a deoxyribose sugar to which a phosphate group is attached. Attachment of nucleotides in linear polymeric form is by means of fusion of the 5 phosphate of one nucleotide to the 3 hydroxyl group of another. Functional DNA occurs in the form of stable double stranded associations of single strands of nucleotides known as deoxyoligonucleotides , which associations occur by means of hydrogen bonding between purine and pyrimidine bases i.e., complementary associations existing either between adenine A and thymine T or guanine G and cytosine C . By convention, nucleotides are referred to by the names of their constituent purine or pyrimidine bases, and the complementary associations of nucleotides in double stranded DNA i.e., A T and G C are referred to as base pairs . Ribonucleic acid is a polynucleotide comprising adenine, guanine, cytosine and uracil U , rather than thymine, bound to ribose and a phosphate group. Most briefly put, the programming function of DNA is generally effected through a process wherein specific DNA nucleotide sequences genes are transcribed into relatively unstable messenger RNA mRNA polymers. The mRNA, in turn, serves as a template for the formation of structural, regulatory and catalytic proteins from amino acids. This mRNA translation process involves the operations of small RNA strands tRNA which transport and align individual amino acids along the mRNA strand to allow for formation of polypeptides in proper amino acid sequences. The mRNA message , derived from DNA and providing the basis for the tRNA supply and orientation of any given one of the twenty amino acids for polypeptide expression , is in the form of triplet codons sequential groupings of three nucleotide bases. In one sense, the formation of a protein is the ultimate form of expression of the programmed genetic message provided by the nucleotide sequence of a gene. Promoter DNA sequences usually precede a gene in a DNA polymer and provide a site for initiation of the transcription into mRNA. Regulator DNA sequences, also usually upstream of i.e., preceding a gene in a given DNA polymer, bind proteins that determine the frequency or rate of transcription initiation. Collectively referred to as promoter regulator or control DNA sequence, these sequences which precede a selected gene or series of genes in a functional DNA polymer cooperate to determine whether the transcription and eventual expression of a gene will occur. DNA sequences which follow a gene in a DNA polymer and provide a signal for termination of the transcription into mRNA are referred to as transcription terminator sequences. A focus of microbiological processing for nearly the last decade has been the attempt to manufacture industrially and pharmaceutically significant substances using organisms which do not initially have genetically coded information concerning the desired product included in their DNA. Simply put, a gene that specifies the structure of a product is either isolated from a donor organism or chemically synthesized and then stably introduced into another organism which is preferably a self replicating unicellular microorganism. Once this is done, the existing machinery far gene expression in the transformed host cells operates to construct the desired product. The art is rich in patent and literature publications relating to recombinant DNA methodologies for the isolation, synthesis, purification and amplification of genetic materials for use in the transformation of selected host organisms. U.S. Letters Patent No. 4,237,224 to Cohen, et al., for example, relates to transformation of procaryotic unicellular host organisms with hybrid viral or circular plasmid DNA which includes selected exogenous DNA sequences. The procedures of the Cohen, et al. patent first involve manufacture of a transformation vector by enzymatically cleaving viral or circular plasmid DNA to form linear DNA strands. Selected foreign exogenous or heterologous DNA strands are also prepared in linear form through use of similar enzymes. The linear viral or plasmid DNA is incubated with the foreign DNA in the presence of ligating enzymes capable of effecting a restoration process and hybrid vectors are formed which include the selected foreign DNA segment spliced into the viral or circular DNA plasmid. Transformation of compatible unicellular host organisms with the hybrid vector results in the formation of multiple copies of the foreign DNA in the host cell population. In some instances, the desired result is simply the amplification of the foreign DNA and the product harvested is DNA. More frequently, the goal of transformation is the expression by the host cells of the foreign DNA in the form of large scale synthesis of isolatable quantities of commercially significant protein or polypeptide fragments coded for by the foreign DNA. See also, e.g., U.S. Letters Patent Nos. 4,269,731 to Shine , 4,273,875 to Manis and 4,293,652 to Cohen . The development of specific DNA sequences for splicing into DNA vectors is accomplished by a variety of techniques, depending to a great deal on the degree of foreignness of the donor to the projected host and the size of the polypeptide to be expressed in the host. At the risk of oversimplification, it can be stated that three alternative principal methods can be employed 1 the straightforward isolation of a double stranded DNA sequence from donor DNA 2 the chemical manufacture of a DNA sequence providing a code for a polypeptide of interest and 3 the The success of procedures such as described in the Cohen, et al. patent is due in large part to the ready availability of restriction endonuclease enyzmes which facilitate the site specific cleavage of both the unhybridized DNA vector and, e.g., eukaryotic DNA strands containing the foreign sequences of interest. Cleavage in a manner providing for the formation of single stranded complementary ends on the double stranded linear DNA strands greatly enhances the likelihood of functional incorporation of the foreign DNA into the vector upon ligating enzyme treatment. A large number of such restriction endonuclease enzymes are currently commercially available See, e.g., BRL Restriction Endonuclease Reference Chart appearing in the 81 82 Catalog of Bethesda Research Laboratories, Inc., Gaithersburg, Maryland . Verification of hybrid formation is facilitated by chromatographic techniques which can, for example, distinguish the hybrid plasmids from non hybrids on the basis of molecular weight. Other useful verification techniques involve radioactive DNA hybridization. Successful expression of an exogenous gene in a transformed host microorganism depends to a great extent on incorporation of the gene into a transformation vector with a suitable promoter regulator region present to insure transcription of the gene into mRNA and other signals which insure translation of the mRNA message into protein e.g., ribosome binding sites . It is not often the case that the original promoter regulator region of a structural gene as might be present in a donor cell will allow for high levels of expression in the new host. Consequently, the gene to be inserted in a DNA vector must either be fitted with a new, host accommodated transcription and translation regulating DNA sequence prior to insertion or it must be inserted at a site where it will come under the control of existing transcription and translation signals in the vector DNA. The terms, growth hormone and somatotropin are generically employed to designate hormonally active polypeptides secreted by the anterior lobe of pituitary glands of a variety of vertebrate species. In all species, the growth hormones function generally to regulate the rate of skeletal growth and gain in body weight. Hypophyseal dysfunction and consequent variations in growth hormone production have been associated with growth abnormalities such as giantism and dwarfism. Significant research efforts have been devoted to the isolation and characterization of mammalian species growth hormones, for the purposes of human therapy and animal husbandry. One of the most exhaustively studied growth hormones has been bovine growth hormone bGH . The complete, 191 amino acid sequence of bGH has been determined and recombinant methods have been employed to clone and sequence cDNA sequences coding for bGH and its precursor polypeptide form which includes a 26 amino acid signal or leader sequence which is cellularly deleted prior to entry of the hormone into circulation. See, e.g., Miller, et al., Prior to the cDNA work of Seeburg, et al., the precise total sequence of amino acids in natural or native rat growth hormone had not been determined. Based on analysis of nucleotides in the cloned cDNA, the sequence of bases in the mRNA was derived. This, in turn, allowed the determination of the sequence of amino acids in the rGH polypeptide. Rigorously speaking, such determination of rGH polypeptide sequence would more accurately be characterized as a prediction since it does not involve amino acid sequencing performed on isolated native growth hormone. When one considers the evidence supporting the accuracy of the prediction the cellular origins of the mRNA, the similarities of predicted sequences to those determined by partial hydrolysis of native hormone and the like the prediction takes on aspects of scientifically determined fact. In this and similar circumstances, complete verification of the predicted polypeptide sequence as identical to that of the previously incompletely sequenced native substance will ordinarily be had upon finding that the polypeptide product of microbial expression of the cDNA possesses the biochemical and immunological properties of the native substance. Comparatively little research effort has been directed to the study of avian growth hormones, with the result that their exact physical characteristics molecular weights, amino acid sequences, and the like are largely unknown. Growth hormone isolated from the pituitaries of four avian species chicken, duck, pigeon, and turkey were examined by the bioassay and immunochemical techniques that proved successful in prior analyses of mammalian growth hormone in Farmer, et al., More recent studies of the biochemical and immunological properties of avian growth hormone indicate that a high plasma level of growth hormone in young birds is at least partially responsible for their high growth rate. The secretion of growth hormone in young chickens is found to be very unstable and affected by stressful stimuli. Normally high circulating concentrations of growth hormone in young chickens are depressed by anesthesia, cold stress, infection, and certain other hormones, the release of which would be expected to be increased during stress. The plasma concentration of growth hormone in young birds is also affected by metabolic and nutritional factors. Under conditions of nutritional deprivation, growth hormone exerts a metabolic role, decreasing energy flow into lipids. It is also noted that circulating levels of growth hormone rise at the beginning of egg production in both turkeys and chickens. Growth hormone is considered to be involved in alleviating the metabolic load which the production of yolky eggs puts on the female bird. Scanes, et al., The isolation of avian growth hormones is presently conducted by fractional purification of extracts from either pituitaries of the avian species, or from avian plasma containing circulating growth hormone. Both procedures provide very small amounts of impure polypeptide substances. Avian growth hormones, including growth hormone specifically isolatable from domesticated chickens, have not heretofore been completely sequenced and, even if the sequence were completely determined, the application of the presently available methods for the chemical synthesis of entire polypeptides of nearly two hundred amino acids would likely provide exceedingly low yields at very high cost. Thus, while information concerning some of the chemical and biological properties of avian growth hormones is known, the art has not been provided with any certain means for obtaining pure preparations of avian growth hormones in significant quantity. Further, recombinant DNA techniques have not been brought to bear in attempting to supply avian growth hormones. CA Vol. 92, 80, 142807s discloses an amino acid composition termed chicken growth hormone but provides only a vague indication of the make up of the isolated material. The isolated material has an estimated molecular weight of 25,800 by SDS PAGE and may include variants or fragments. EP A 0047600 relates to a DNA transfer vector containing a nucleotide sequence coding for bovine pre growth or growth hormone and the expression of the cloned DNA in microorganisms. EP A 0012494 discloses the use of recombinant DNA procedures for making a chimeric protein comprising rat growth hormone. According to the present invention, recombinant DNA techniques have for the first time been brought to bear to effect the quantitative microbial synthesis of polypeptide substances having the biochemical and immunological properties of avian growth hormones. The achievement of this result initially involved the According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a purified and isolated nucleic acid described by a nucleotide sequence selected from the group consisting of According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided an avian growth hormone encoded by a nucleic acid described by a nucleotide sequence selected from the group consisting of According to one of its aspects, the present invention provides polypeptides characterized by including part or all of the following amino acid sequence commencing at the amino terminal The above characterized polypeptide conforms with published fragmentary sequences for avian growth hormone and Met ¹,des Thr¹ form possesses demonstrable avian growth hormone biochemical and immunological properties in competition assays wherein it selectively competes with ovine growth hormone for antigen antibody complex formation with anti ovine growth hormone antibody. It is thus verified as being an avian growth hormone, and specifically avian growth hormone native to chickens. According to another of its aspects, the present invention provides polypeptides characterized by including part or all of the following amino acid sequence commencing at its amino terminal The above described sequence also conforms with sparse published data on avian growth hormone, and is specifically an amino acid sequence for avian growth hormone native to the turkey species. The above amino acid sequences for avian growth hormones of the type native to chicken and turkey species may be directly expressed by selected host microorganisms with an initial methionine residue at the amino terminal, i.e., as the Met ¹ analog of the mature polypeptide or expressed as a portion of a fusion protein from which they may be isolated by selective cleavage. They may also be directly expressed with an approximately 25 amino acid leader region, set out below, which is duplicative of a leader region synthesized in avian chicken and turkey pituitary cells and which is apparently processed off of the mature polypeptide prior to entry of the growth hormone into circulation. Polypeptides provided by the present invention may suitably be employed in the manufacture of therapeutic or growth inducing agents useful in treating and raising fowl, especially chickens and turkeys, or other animals. The polypeptides also provide a large and reliably produced quantity of pure avian growth hormone substances useful in the development of information concerning avian metabolism. As an example, purified and isolated polypeptides of the invention are expected to be highly useful in immunological determinations wherein they may serve as readily quantified antigens or stimulants for the development of specific antibodies to avian growth hormones. Polypeptides of the invention are produced in quantity by recombinant methods wherein selected host cells, preferably of a microorganism such as The above specified DNA sequences for avian growth hormone polypeptides may be incorporated into a vector in association with a DNA sequence coding for an amino acid leader sequence such as is apparently present in precursor polypeptides formed in avian pituitary cells, and or with 5 and 3 untranslated sequences. These sequences on either side of the protein coding DNA sequence may be employed to supply unique endonuclease enzyme restriction sites to facilitate insertion into a selected vector. As an example, part or all of the following 5 untranslated DNA sequence and leader sequence may be employed 5 to the codon for the initial amino acid in one of the avian growth hormone sequences above Similarly, one or more transcription stop codons or part or all of the naturally occurring 3 untranslated DNA sequences may be employed 3 to the codon for the carboxy terminal Ile¹⁹¹ amino acid. The above specified DNA sequences, by virtue of their cDNA origins i.e., by virtue of development as a complement to chicken growth hormone mRNA and turkey growth hormone mRNA, respectively , comprise DNA triplet codons especially suited for high level expression of growth hormone in avian cells. When polypeptide expression in microorganisms such as bacteria and yeast is to be achieved, it may be desirable that a part or the entirety of the sequences be substituted with a sequence of bases arranged into codons which are the subject of preferred translation by the projected host. The invention thus comprehends the above specified sequences and alternative sequences of nucleotide bases comprising triplet codons specifying polypeptides with the same sequence of amino acids. A specific aspect of the invention, therefore, is the provision of DNA sequences which code for polypeptides displaying the biochemical and immunological properties of avian growth hormone and which comprise nucleotides arranged entirely or in part according to such codon usages as are endogenous to avian cells and or entirely or in part according to codons noted to be the subject of preferred or optimal expression in microorganisms. One such composite or hybrid sequence of the invention includes a cDNA derived duplicate of a chicken growth hormone nucleotide sequence wherein approximately 32 of the initial codons commencing at the 5 end of the polypeptide coding region are replaced and supplemented by the following manufactured DNA sequence This exemplary composite sequence is seen to provide various features making it especially useful in securing microbial expression of polypeptides of the invention in that its manufactured portion includes a base codon specifying an initial methionine base pair numbers 8 10 base codons optimally expressed in bacteria and bases facilitating use of readily available restriction endonucleases in the formation of hybrid transformation vectors an In preferred embodiments, the DNA sequences of the invention are inserted into microorganism transformation vectors such as self replicating, selectable plasmids derived from Comprehended by the present invention, therefore, is the novel method for manufacturing an avian growth hormone polypeptide substance comprising 1 transforming a selected microorganism with a transformation vector including a DNA sequence capable of directing microorganism synthesis of a polypeptide possessing one or more of the biochemical and immunological properties of avian growth hormone 2 growing microorganisms so transformed under suitable nutrient conditions and, 3 isolating from said microorganisms the product of the expression of said DNA sequence therein. A DNA vector, designated cGH T21, suitable for use in practice of the invention to stably transform bacterial cells and to thereby allow for the expression therein of readily isolatable quantities of a polypeptides according to the invention has been deposited with the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Maryland. The plasmid vector is harbored in a collection of Further aspects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description of the practice of preferred embodiments thereof. According to the present invention, a high molecular weight polypeptide having the biochemical and immunological properties of avian growth hormone native to the chicken species has been produced in isolatable quantities in cells other than those of functional avian pituitary tissue. These results were obtained by a series of recombinant DNA manipulative procedures involving, The following example is directed to isolation of messenger RNA from chicken pituitary glands. Chicken pituitary glands were extracted from one year old spent hens and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Approximately 0.4 grams of chicken pituitary roughly 40 50 pituitaries were extracted using the guanidinium thiocynate procedure for the quantitative isolation of intact RNA. Chirgwin, et al., Briefly, the Chirgwin, et al. procedure involves homogenizing the chicken pituitaries in a stock solution of guanidinium thiocynate, a strong denaturant. The homogenates are centrifuged to sediment particulate material and the supernates are mixed with acetic acid and incubated to precipitate the nucleic acid. The material is then centrifuged and the resulting pellet resuspended in guanidine hydrochloride stock solution. The RNA is re precipitated in solution with acetic acid and ethanol, incubated, and centrifuged. After a final re precipitation from guanidine hydrochloride, the re precipitated material is centrifuged again and the pellets dispersed in ethanol at room temperature. Following centrifugation, the ethanol is removed from the pellet by a stream of nitrogen and the RNA dissolved in sterile water. The RNA is reprecipitated with sodium acetate pH 7.0 and ethanol. RNA is sedimented from the ethanol suspension by centrifugation, the pellets thoroughly washed with ethanol, dried with nitrogen, and dissolved again in sterile water. The final solution in sterile water contains the purified extracts of total RNA from the chicken pituitaries. To obtain only the messenger RNA from the total RNA solution, the RNA solution is passed through a column containing oligodeoxythymidylate oligo dT Collaborative Research, Inc. . The poly adenylated poly A tails characteristic of messenger RNA adhere to the column while ribosomal RNA is discarded in the eluate. Following this procedure, 16 µg of poly adenylated messenger RNA poly A mRNA are isolated. The following example is directed to construction of cDNA clones from the messenger RNA isolated in Example 1. Prior to its use in the cDNA synthesis procedure of Okayama, et al., Briefly described, the Okayama procedure involves the following steps A vector primer is prepared by digesting the plasmid recombinant pBR322 SV40 map units 0.71 0.86 Paul Berg, Ph.D., Stanford University with An oligodeoxyguanylate, oligo dG tailed linker DNA is prepared by digesting pBR322 SV40 map units 0.19 0.32 Berg with The first step in cDNA synthesis involves adding the methylmercury hydroxide treated mRNA to the reverse transcription reaction, which contains 2 mercapto ethanol, Tris, magnesium chloride, ³²P α dCTP New England Nuclear , reverse transcriptase Life Sciences, Inc. , and vector primer. In this reaction, the plasmid vector DNA functions as the primer for the synthesis of the first cDNA strand. Annealing of the poly A messenger RNA to the poly dT tailed vector DNA generates the substrate for reverse transcription of the mRNA sequence. To generate a cohesive tail at the end of the cDNA so that it can be ligated to the other end of the vector primer DNA and thereby provide the template for second strand DNA synthesis, the double stranded plasmid cDNA mRNA from the reverse transcription reaction is added to a mixture containing ³²P α dCTP and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. This step adds oligo dC tails to the 3 ends of the vector primer c DNA hybrid. The pellet from the oligo dC addition reaction is then added to a reaction containing The Thus, the full or nearly full length reverse transcript of the mRNAs are preferentially converted to duplex cDNAs. The cDNAs are then transformed by incubation into a host microorganism The following example is directed to isolation of chicken species avian growth hormone coding hereafter cGH clones by hybridization of pBR322 SV40 recombinants containing the cDNA sequence with a nick translated probe comprising DNA fragments coding for bovine growth hormone and rat growth hormone, respectively. The complexity of the mRNA isolated from chicken pituitaries necessitates screening a moderate number of recombinant clones containing cDNA inserts in order to locate the clone which codes for synthesis of a polypeptide having one or more of the biochemical and immunological properties of chicken growth hormone. According to the procedure of Hanahan, et al., The recombinant clones obtained are hybridized with either a radiolabelled 490 base pair PvuII fragment from pBR322 bGH15 a plasmid including a bovine growth hormone gene or a radiolabelled 816 base pair fragment from pRGH 1 Seeberg, et al, Each clone digested with restriction endonucleases RsaI New England Biology Labs , The following example is directed to characterizing by sequence analysis a cGH coding clone. Sequencing of the recombinant cGH DNA obtained by the procedure of Example 3 was accomplished by the dideoxy method of Sanger, et al., The single stranded DNA phage M 13 was used as a cloning vector for supplying single stranded DNA templates from the double stranded cDNA clones. The Sanger, et al. method revealed the sequence for the cGH protein coding DNA single strand in M 13, which included the cGH coding region having a single BamHI recognition site an approximately 75 base sequence 5 to the cGH coding region which sequence presumptively codes for a 25 amino acid leader region and 3 and 5 untranslated regions. This sequence is set out in Table I below with its accompanying amino acid translation The above sequence is not readily susceptible for securing direct expression of cGH in a microbial host. To secure such expression the cGH coding region should be provided with an initial ATG codon and the sequence should be inserted in a transformation vector at a site under control of a suitable promoter regulator DNA sequence. The following Example 5 relates to construction of an expression vector. The following example is directed to constructing a plasmid expression vector, cGH T21 harbored in A.T.C.C. 39182 cells. A pBR322 derived expression plasmid Pint γ tx B4 was used which contained a tryptophan promoter After transformation clones were screened for containing a complete cGH coding region by digestion with The following example is directed to transforming Cells of The following example relates to biochemical similarity of microbially produced chicken species avian growth hormone according to the invention and growth hormone purified from chicken pituitary glands. Chicken growth hormone purified from pituitary glands exhibits a molecular weight MW of approximately 24,000 as measured by SDS Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis SDS PAGE . The MW of the microbially produced avian growth hormone of the invention was determined by SDS PAGE of ³⁵S methionine ³⁵S met labeled maxicells CSR603 harboring plasmid, cGH T21. Briefly, the procedure involves growing 10mls of CSR603 cGH T21 in K media Rupp, et al., Two protein bands were detected after autoradiography of the gel. One protein, β lactamase with a MW of 30,000 is present in all cultures resistant to ampicillin and containing pBR322 derived plasmids. A second protein of MW 24,000 is seen only in cultures containing the plasmid cGH T21 encoding the cGH gene. The MW of the microbially produced avian growth hormone is thus similar to that found for the natural growth hormone isolated from chicken pituitary tissue. The following example describes a sequential competition radioimmunoassay employing the avian growth hormone polypeptide produced in cells transformed with cGH T21. The bacterial lysate of Example 6 including chicken growth hormone expressed in Purified ovine growth hormone oGH is radioiodinated for use as tracer in this assay using a modification of the chloramine T reaction procedure described by Hunter and Greenwood, Selected fractions containing radiolabelled material are tested for immune precipitability using the procedure of Keshet, et al., In these reactions, a fixed amount of ¹²⁵I labelled oGH reacts with limiting amounts of anti oGH or anti cGH to produce immune complexes of I¹²⁵ oGH anti oGH. These immune complexes are then precipitated by the The most immune precipitable column fractions are then used to construct a serum dilution curve using the same procedure as above, but employing serum dilutions over the range of 1 x 10 ³ to 1 x 10 ⁶. The serum dilution giving half maximal precipitation of 2.5 x 10⁴ cpm of labelled oGH is used in subsequent competition radioimmunoassays. In those assays, 1 x 10 ⁶ to 1 x 10 ¹⁰g of purified oGH or 10⁰ to 10 ² dilutions of bacterial lysates of Example 7 containing cGH are pre incubated with the appropriate dilution of anti oGH or anti cGH for 2 hours at room temperature, at which time 2.5 x 10 ⁴ to 3.5 x 10 ⁴ cpm of ¹²⁵I oGH is added and the subsequent reactions, centrifugation and washing are accomplished as described above. When the bacterial lysate cGH is added to a fixed amount of anti oGH or anti cGH, the appropriate immune complexes are formed. The fixed amount of labelled oGH added to the reaction mixture complexes with any anti oGH or anti cGH not previously bound to the bacterial lysate cGH competitor. The amount of radioactivity in the resulting precipitate is inversely proportional to the amount of cGH competitor present in the sample. This immunoassay thus indicates that the bacterial lysates of Example 6 do, indeed, contain the DNA sequence capable of synthesizing a polypeptide exhibiting one or more of the biological characteristics of chicken growth hormone including the ability of the polypeptide to form antigen antibody complexes with antibodies to homologous and heterologous species growth hormone. The following example describes an In an effort to increase expression of the cGH gene, a nucleotide sequence coding for the first third of the gene has been synthesized It may be noted that the above sequence may be inserted in plasmid cGH T21 from which an The following example relates to manipulations leading to development of another expression vector successfully employed to secure high levels of expression of a polypeptide having the biochemical and immunological properties of avian growth hormone, specifically Met ¹,des Thr¹ cGH polypeptide. The manipulations herein described involved use of plasmid pCFM414 which is the subject of co owned, co pending U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 521,964, filed August 10, 1983, by C.F. Morris, entitled DNA Vector . The disclosures of said application are specifically incorporated by reference herein. Briefly noted, plasmid pCFM414 A.T.C.C. 40076 includes a temperature sensitive mutation in the copy control region. Upon transformation with this vector, host cell cultures grown at 30 C will have a low number of copies of the plasmid. The plasmid copy number increases fiftyfold or more i.e., runs away within the host cells upon elevation of the culture temperature above 34 C. Growth at 37 C will ordinarily be lethal to the cells but prior to cell death there is an opportunity for multiple transcriptions of plasmid DNA. The specific manipulations involved in construction of a vector using A.T.C.C. 40076 were as follows. Plasmid cGH T21 in A.T.C.C. 39182 was digested with restriction endonucleases Plasmid pCFM414 was digested with The following example describes procedures for obtaining and sequencing DNA for turkey species avian growth hormone. Another avian growth hormone polypeptide coding DNA sequence, for turkey growth hormone tGH , was prepared by employing the procedures of Examples 1 through 4 above, with two alterations in procedure 1 turkey pituitaries were used in the procedure of Example 1 and 2 a cGH probe i.e., a The single stranded DNA phage M 13 was used as a cloning vector for supplying single stranded DNA templates from the double stranded cDNA clones. The Sanger, et al. method revealed the sequence for the tGH protein coding DNA single strand in M 13. This sequence, like that of cGH, includes the polypeptide coding region containing a single It will be apparent from comparison of the above sequence to the Table I sequence of cDNA derived from chicken pituitary cells that in a number of instances alternative codons specifying the same amino acid are present and that the tGH cDNA sequence specifies a polypeptide with substantial homology to that specified by the cGH cDNA sequence. One hundred and eighty five of the one hundred ninety one amino acid residues are identical. In the sequence specified by the tGH gene, threonine is specified at residue number 4, rather than an alanine as in the cGH gene. In a like manner, threonine rather than alanine is specified at position number 11 methionine rather than valine is specified at position number 90 arginine rather than lysine is specified at position number 144 serine rather than asparagine is specified at position number 151 and asparagine rather than threonine is specified at position number 190. The amino acids specified for the leader sequence are identical except for the presence of glycine at position 4, rather than glutamine. To secure direct expression of the tGH cDNA sequence in a microbial host, the tGH coding region should be provided with an initial ATG codon 3 to the codon for the amino terminal threonine residue and the sequence inserted in a transformation vector at a site under control of a suitable promoter regulator DNA sequence. An expression vector similar to that constructed in Example 5 for cGH can be employed to express tGH in a microbial host. Similarly, a replacement nucleotide sequence for the first third of the tGH derived gene may be constructed and employed as in Example 9 to place selected restriction endonuclease enzyme recognition sites in the sequence, to obtain optimal codon usage for expression in While the foregoing illustrative examples relate generally to microbial expression of cGH by bacterial cells transformed with a bacterially derived vector, it will be apparent that expression in yeast and other microorganism cells is also contemplated, as is the development of DNA sequences having manufactured portions including codons which are the subject of optimal expression in the selected host. Yeast expression, for example, would involve vector development in the context of the requirements peculiar to the synthesis of protein in yeast host cells, e.g., use of DNA vectors capable of autonomous replication in yeast, use of yeast promoter regulator regions, and the like. See, e.g., Valenzuela, et al., As previously noted, polypeptide products of the invention are expected to have commercial utility in animal husbandry procedures involving, e.g., continuous low level delivery of products to poultry as a feed or water supplement or as active components delivered by means of a slow dissolving or slow ingredient releasing subcutaneous implant. Such delivery systems would be particularly advantageous in treatment of young fowl during early growth stages.
