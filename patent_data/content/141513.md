# Improved strength aerosol dome.

## Abstract
This relates to an improved aerosol container 12 of the type wherein the dome 14 is formed separately from the body and is secured to the body by a conventional double seam 16 . The aerosol container is improved by squeezing the double seam radially inwardly so that it is, in effect, necked in and may also be tilted to correspond generally to the dome profile. In the utlimate condition the upper part of the body is also tilted radially inwardly and the chuck wall upper portion contacts the dome 14 above the annular countersink completely to close the countersink 20 . The container need not be an aerosol container, but may beneficially have not only the double seam joining the top end to the body radially inwardly offset or necked in, but also if the bottom of the container is separately formed from the body, the double seam joining 48 the bottom to the body should also be radially inwardly offset or necked in so that bodies of adjacent containers may be in touching relation, thus requiring less material for a container and at the same time assuring a tight package. This abstract forms no part of the specification of this application and is not to be construed as limiting the claims of the application.
