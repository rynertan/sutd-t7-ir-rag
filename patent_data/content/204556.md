The invention will be more clearly understood from the following description of an embodiment thereof, given by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Referring to the drawings, there is illustrated imprinter apparatus according to the invention, indicated generally by the reference numeral 1 for imprinting characters from a character imprint source member such as a credit card 2 onto an imprint recording document such as a docket 3. The credit card 2 is illustrated in Figs. 3 and 4 in full lines and in broken lines in Fig. 6, while the docket 3 is illustrated in broken lines in Figs. 3 to 6. The apparatus 1 comprises a housing 4 having an upper entrance opening 5 and an upper discharge opening 6 for introduction and discharge of the docket 3. The credit card 2 is mounted on a carrier member comprising a platen 8 portion 9 of which projects, in use, through an elongate slot 10 in a side wall 11 of the housing 4. The carrier member 8 includes a credit card receiving sheet metal member 15 having a pair of side members 16 which are bent upwardly inwardly to engage the side edges of the credit card 2. Characters identifying details of the merchant using the apparatus are provided at 18 on the platen 8. A date roller 19 is also provided on the platen 8. Means for receiving and positioning the docket 3 comprises an abutment 20 extending upwardly from a document supporting surface 21 to be abutted by a leading edge of the docket 3 upon insertion of the docket 3 through the entrance opening 5. The carrier member 8 runs in a guide comprising a subtantially V shaped slot 25 formed in a metal support 26. The slot 25 engages an elongate protusion 27 extending from one side 28 of the carrier member 4. The carrier member 8 is driven beneath an imprint means which in this case is provided by an inked roller 30 for imprinting the characters onto the docket 3. The inked roller 30 is provided in a cassette 29 which, if desired may be disposable once the ink has been used up. Where the roller 30 or cassette 29 is disposable, it is envisaged that the cassette 29 may be attached to the apparatus by a suitable quick release mechanism. A drive means comprising a drive roller 31 drives the carrier member 8 beneath the inked roller 30. The drive roller 31 which is driven by an electric motor 45 through a belt drive 46 comprises a shaft 32 rotatable in a bearing not shown in the metal support 26 and in a bearing 33 mounted in a support bracket 34 which is secured to the support 26 by screws 35. A pair of disc members 37 fast on the shaft 32 bear on the carrier member 8 to drive it beneath the inked roller 30. As will be apparent particularly from Figs. 3 and 4 each of the disc members 37 has a substantially cylindrical periphery 38 interrupted by a flattened portion 39, the cylindrical portion 38 engaging the carrier member 8 to advance the carrier member 8 between start and discharge positions and the flattened portion 39 allowing relative sliding movement of the carrier member 8 for return of the carrier member to the start position illustrated in Fig. 3. Return means for returning the carrier member 8 to the start position is in this case provided by a coiled tensator spring 40 mounted on a shaft 41 in a housing 43 and connected to the underside of the carrier member at 42. As the drive roller 31 rotates in the direction of the arrow B in Fig. 1 the cylindrical or rounded portion 38 of the periphery of the disc members 37 drives the carrier member beneath the inked roller 30 and the radius of the discs is such as to press the carrier member 8 against the inked roller 30 with sufficient force to cause imprinting of the characters from the credit card 2, merchants characters 18 and date roller characters 19 onto the docket 3. Further, the circumference of the rounded portion 38 of the disc members 37 is such that one revolution of the drive roller 31 completes one pass of the carrier member beneath the ink roller, thus on completion of a pass imprinting is complete, the docket 3 is discharged through the discharge opening 6 and the carrier member 8 is returned to the start position ready to receive another docket. Document sensor means to sense the presence of a docket 3 on the carrier member 8 the drive roller 31 in this case comprises a microswitch 50 which is positioned to be activated by portion of the docket 3 upon reaching the abutment 20 to energise the motor 45 for driving the carrier member 8 through an imprinting stroke. Referring to Fig. 5, means for retaining the microswitch 50 activated during an imprinting stroke thereby maintaining drive on the drive roller 31 is provided by a cam 51 on the shaft 32 of the drive roller which operates a pivotal member 52 which bears on an arm 53 of the microswitch to retain the microswitch 50 activated. An adjusting screw 54 is provided on the pivotal member 52 to bear on the arm 53. When the drive roller 31 has completed one revolution, the profile of the cam 51 is such that the pivotal member 52 is released from the microswitch arm 53, thus deactivating the microswitch 50 and turning off the motor 45. Referring particularly to Figs. 3 and 4 delivery means for delivering an imprinted docket 3 from the imprinter apparatus 1 through the exit opening 6 is in this case provided by a guide finger member 55 which extends into a groove 56 in the carrier member 8 when the carrier member approaches a discharge end position to move underneath the docket 3 and direct it through the exit opening 6. In use, the credit card 2 is entered into side members 16 of the carrier member 8 through the slot 10 in the side wall 11 of the housing 4. The carrier member 8 will be in the position illustrated in Fig. 3. The docket 3 is then inserted through the entrance opening 5 in the housing 4 until it reaches the abutment 20 of the carrier member 8. Just as the docket 3 reaches the abutment 20 it triggers the microswitch arm 53, thereby activating the motor 45 and in turn the drive roller 31. As the drive roller 31 rotates, the rounded portion 38 of the circumference of the discs 37 drive the carrier member 8 between the drive roller 31 and the inked roller 30 in the direction of the arrow C of Fig. 4. The cam 51 and pivotal member 52 retains the microswitch 50 active, and in turn the motor 45. On completing a pass of the carrier member 8 between the inked roller 30 and the drive roller 31, the microswitch 50 is deactivated, and thus the motor 45. At this stage the flatted portion 38 of the discs 37 is adjacent the carrier member 8. The carrier member 8 is thus free to slide between the inked roller 30 and the driver roller 31, and the spring 40 thereby returns the carrier member 8 to its reset position illustrated in Fig. 3. While the carrier member 8 is being driven between the drive roller 31 and the inked roller 30, the characters on the credit card 2, the merchant s identification characters 18 and date roller characters 19 are imprinted onto the docket 3. During this operation as the carrier member 8 moves in the direction of the arrow C of Fig. 4, the guide finger 55 directs the docket 3 into the exit opening 6 and the docket 3 is discharged through the opening 6. The credit card 2 is then removed, and the apparatus 1 is ready for the next operation. It will be appreciated that while a particular drive means has been described for driving the carrier member between the print roller, any other suitable drive means could be used. For example, instead of having a pair of discs, an elongated roller could be used, and in this case it is envisaged that portion of the periphery of the roller would be flattened. Although needless to say, it will be appreciated that it is not necessary for the drive roller to be flattened. For example, in certain cases it is envisaged that a roller rotatable about an eccentric axis could be used. Also, it is envisaged that a roller of circular cross section rotating about a concentric rotational axis could be used if desired. In this case, however, it is envisaged that either a release means to release the pressure between the drive roller and the inked roller would be provided to allow for the return of the carrier member, or alternatively, the roller could be driven in reverse to return the carrier member. Further, it will be appreciated that means other than a tensator spring could be used to return the carrier. It is envisaged that a coil spring may be used. It is envisaged that many other shapes and constructions of carrier member could be provided, as indeed could many other shapes and constructions of housing, as well as entrance and exit openings. Furthermore, it will be appreciated that while the apparatus has been described for imprinting embossed information on a credit card onto a docket, the apparatus could be used for imprinting information from any suitable imprint source member onto any type of document. It will be appreciated that the drive roller means may be provided with a friction gripping means for movement of the carrier member. For example, in the case of the disc members 37 described above an O ring or the like may be fitted over the outer periphery and may be located in a groove or recess in the disc member. It will further be appreciated that means may be provided for adjusting the pressure applied by the imprint roller. For example, the imprint roller may be eccentrically mounted to allow pressure adjustment. In addition, it will be appreciated that alignment means may be provided for alignment of the drive roller means with respect to the imprint roller. For example, the drive roller may be mounted in bearings, at least one of which is eccentric to allow adjustment of the drive roller. Further, it will be appreciated that the imprinter apparatus according to the invention may be used in association with means for validating a credit card.
