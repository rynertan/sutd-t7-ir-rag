## Description
t A HYDROMERATTURGICAL PROCESS FOR RECOVERING PE3CIOUS METALS FROM ANODE SLIME This invention relates to a process for recovering the precious metals gold, silver, selenium, and tellcirium, from anode slime. In the last threes decades, pyrometallurgical processes have been used to recover gold, silver, copper, and selenium from anode slime. The conventional process Figure 1 involves numerous, and often complex, hydroand pyrometallurgical operations. The first step is to remove copper. Copper present in the slimes occurs usually as metallic copper dislodged from the anodes, together with copper sulphide, selenides, and tellurides.Copper removal is accomplished by carrying out oxidizing roast at 260 43000 followed by sulphide acid leaching.The copper sulphate solutions obtained by these methods are usually contaminated with selenium and silver, which must be removed before the copper is recovered by electrowinning, cementation, or crystallisation as copper sulphate. Selenium is present in the slimes in the elementary form as well as metallic selenides. It is generally recovered by smelting the decopperized anode slimes with soda or soda nitre and dissolving the resulting water soluble sodium selenite from the crushed slag. Elementary selenium is precipitated by passing sulphur dioxide through the acidic leached solution. Both of the above recovered selenium products should be purified by re dissolution, re precipitation, and final distillation to obtain a marketable product. The decopperized anode slimes, containing varying amounts of selenium, are smelted in a Dore furnace.The resulting Dory metal is a gold silver copper alloy containing approximately 8 silver. This metal is processed electrolytically using the Moebius system to refine silver and separate gold and platinoids. TheMoebius cell cathodes receive a deposit of silver crystals with three nines quality or better. The gold and platinoids, together with some silver, are collected as an anode sludge in a fabric bag. This sludge may be treated by boiling with sulphuric acid to remove the silver and impurities, and high purity gold may then be recovered from the residue by refining in Wholwill cells. The above described conventional pyrometallurgical process to recover the precious metals is getting harder and harder to operate because elegy costs 7lFa ve soared, strict pollution laws have been enacted, and high grade ore has been depleted. In order to cope with soaring energy costs, to comply with strict pollution laws, and to face up to the depletion of high grade ore, a hydrometallurgical process to recover the precious metals has been developed and tested successfully by us. The process is economic, energy saving, and practically pollutionfree. The hydrometallurgical process consists of 1 a leaching step, where the precious metals are introduced to the aqueous envirenment, 2 a solvent extraction step, where the metals are separated and purified, and 3 a reduction step, where the metallic ions are reduced and precipitated from solution.Owing to the low energy consumption 151x106 Btu 160x109J of energy consumed per ton of gold recovered calculated for the new process against 59,000x106 Btu 62,000x109J of energy consumed per ton of gold recovered from the conventional process H.H. Xellogg, sizing up the requirements for producing primary materials ,Engineering and Mining Journal, April, 1977, pp. 61 65 , the hydrometallurgical process makes itself much more economical and attractive. The process comprises preferably the following steps 1 Leaching of decopperized anode slimes by using nitric acid as the leaching agent. In this step, silver, copper, selenium, tellurium, etc. can be leached from the slimes to the aqueous medium. 2 Recovering of silver as silver chloride by adding an appropriate amount of hydrochloric acid to the aqueous medium from step 1 . 3 Denitration and chlorination of the aqueous medium from step 2 by using a liquid liquid extraction technique. 4j Separation of tellurium from copper and selenium by using a liquid liquid extraction technique. 5 Recovery of selenium by passing sulphur dioxide through the aqueous medium from step 4 . 6 Stripping of tellurium from the organic medium from step 4 by hydrochloric acid. 7 Recovery of tellurium by passing sulphur dioxide through the aqueous medium from step 6 . 8 Beaching of the residue from step 1 by aqua regia. 9 Separating gold from silver, platinoids, and other impurities by a liquid liquid extraction technique. 10 Reduction of gold from the organic medium from step 9 by adding an appropriate amount of reducing agent. In the preferred process, all of the organic media and most of the mineral acids are recycled and reused. Niche hydrometallurgical procedures outlined above have the following advantages over the pyrometallurgical art. 1 The highest operating temperature in the hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical processes are 0 0 80 C and 1300 C. respectively. Therefore, the energy consumption for the present hydrometallurgical process is much lower than for the pyrometallurgical art. 2 The treatment of the wastes from the present process is much easier from the pyrometallurgical art. 3 The recovery rate of selenium for the present process is greater than 94 , whereas for the pyrometallurgical art it seldom exceeds 800 0, 4 In the present process, gold and silver can be recovered directly without going through a goldsilver alloy. 5 The liquid liquid extraction technique is suitable for recovering metals from low content of mother liquor. This technique is easy to operate and is also suitable for continuous operation. 6 In the present process all of the organic media and most of the mineral acids can be recycled and reused, along with the low energy consumptions, making the process economical and attractive. In the accompanying drawings Figure 1 is a flow sheet of the conventional pyrometallurgical process and Figure 2 is a.flow sheet of a hydrometallurgical process according to the present invention. To more fully illustrate the process of the invention, the following Example is presented, it being understood, however, that the example is given by way of illustration and not by way of limitation. TheExample corresponds to the flow sheet of Figure 2. EXANP lE Decopperized anode slime leaching was carried out experimentally in a flask equipped with an agitator, a condenser, heating apparatus, and a temperature indicator and controller. 1500 g of decopperized anode slime containing 283.8 g of silver, 222.3 g of selenium, and 13.95 g of tellurium, together with a minimum amount of nitric acid, was placed in the previously mentioned flask and heated for 2 hours at a temperature of 80 C. The mixture was then filtered and the residue was sent to an aqua regia leaching step see below for the recovery of gold. The filtered solution was found to contain 272.4 g of silver, 215.6 g of selenium, and 10.6 g of tellurium, together with the other impurities this is equivalent to a 96.1 , 97 , and 76 leaching rate for silver selenium, and tellurium respectively. To the filtered solution, a minimum amount of hydro chloride acid was added an i the resulting prccipitated silver chloride was filtered, washed, and dried to give a purity of 99.zoo white silver chloride. Impurities such as lead and tellurium are less than 0. 017 and 0.001 After recovering silver chloride, the filtered solution was sent to denitration and chlorination simultaneous using a liquid liquid extraction technique. The experiment was carried out in a sixstage mixer settler in practice more than six stages may be used .The filtered solution with a nitrate ion level of 5.7 M after removal of silver chloride was fed to the first stage at a rate of 5.0 parts per minute and hydrochloric acid was fed to the third or the fourth stage at a rate of 1.67 parts per minute.An organic. extractant was prepared containing about 30 parts by volume of kerosene and 70 parts by volume of tri n butyl phosphate. This organic extractant was fed to the sixth stage of the mixer settler at a rate of 12.7 parts per minute. The system, as described above, was operated for about 16 hours at the beforementioned flow rates. Samples were collected for every other 10 minutes in the first hour, 20. minutes in the second hour, and 30 minutes in the rest of the operating period. The aqueous raffinate containing most of the metal ions left the sixth stage at a nitrate and chloride ion level of 0.1 N and 2.15 M respectively.This aqueous solution was concentrated to 4.7 M in chloride ion level by vacuum evaporation and was sent to a selenium and tellurium separation step see below .The nitrate ion loaded organic medium leaving the first extraction stage at a rate of 12.7 parts per minute was fed to the first of six stripping stages for recovering nitric acid. Water was used as the stripping agent at a rate of 8.5 parts per minute and was fed to the sixth stripping stage. The recovered nitric acid with a nitrate ion level of 2.5 M was sent for concentration and recycling to the anode slime leaching step. The stripped organic extractant was recycled to the denitration and chlorination step. After denitration, chlorination, and evaporation, the solution at a chloride ion level of 4.7 M was fed to the second of two selenium tellurium separation solvent extraction stages at a rate of 3 parts per minute. This operation was carried out in a sixstage mixer settler.having two extraction stages, two scrubbing stages, and two stripping stages. An organic extractant was prepared containing 30 parts by volume of tri n butyl phosphate and 70 parts by volume of kerosene.The organic extractant was fed to the first selenium tellurium separation stage at a rate of 4.5 parts per minute. 5 M hydrochloric acid was fed to the second scrubbing stage at a rate of 0.9 parts per minute as the scrubbing agent and 0.5 M hydrochloric acid was fed to the second stripping stage at the rate of 0.9 parts per minute as the stripping agent. 69 g l selenium containing solution with 4.5 M in chloride ion level left the first extraction stage. This selenium containing solution was concentrated to 7.0 M in chloride ion level, and sulphur dioxide was then passed through this concentrated selenium containing solution to reduce selenium. Red brick selenium was precipitated out. After filtration, washing, and drying, 210 g of dark grey selenium with purity greater than 99.5 were obtained.This is equal to a 94.4 recovery rate for selenium. The residue from selenium reduction can be subjected to copper cementation or crystallization. 14.1 g l of tellurium containing solution with 1.67 M in chloride ion level left the first stripping stage.Sulphur dioxide was passed through this tellurium containing solution to reduce tellurium. After filtration, washing, and drying, 9.9 g of high purity dark grey tellurium were obtained. This indicates a 71 recovery rate for tellurium. The stripped organic extractant leaving the second stripping stage was recycled to the first extraction stage. Aqua regia leaching was conducted in the same apparatus as the decopperized anode slime leaching step, 1500 grams of the residue, containing 37.395 g of gold, from the decopperized anode slime leaching step together with a minimum amount of aqua regia were charged into the leaching apparatus. This system was maintained at 80 C for 4 hours. The mixture was then filtered, and the residue, containing 0.0162 of gold, 1.51 of silver, and 26 of lead was recycled to the copper smelter. The filtered solution with a gold concentration of 6.566 g l was fed to the second of two extraction stages at a rate of 2.92 parts per minute for recovering gold. This experiment was carried out in a five stage mixer settler having two extraction stages and three scrubbing stages. Diethylene glycol dibutyl ether was used as an organic extractant. This organic extractant was fed to the first extraction stage at a rate of 0.97 parts per minute. 3 M hydrochloric acid solution was used as the scrubbing agent and was fed to the third scrubbing stage at a rate of 0.97 parts per minute. Ehe raffinate containing 2 ppm of gold left the first extraction stage at a rate of 3.89 parts per minute. he gold loaded organic extract ant left the third scrubbing stage at a rate of 0.97 parts per minute. This gold loaded organic extract ant was charged into a flask containing a minimum amount of oxalic acid 0 solution and was kept at 80 C with occasional stirring to ensure complete reduction of gold to the metallic state sponge gold . The metal was filtered and was washed successively with hydrochloric acid, water, and methanol. Finally, the gold was ignited to constant weight. 99.46 per cent primary recovery rate could be obtained by using this process. The organic extractant from which the gold had been reduced was recovered and reused.
