# A GEAR OPERATING MECHANISM OF AN AUTOMOTIVE MANUAL TRANSMISSION

## Abstract
In a manual transmission having a gear 12 which is movable within a range from its inoperative position to its operating position, there is provided a gear operating mechanism which is constructed to positively prevent the undesirable gear disengagement . The mechanism com prises a bracket 20 secured to a transmission case 10 , an operating lever 16 pivotally connected to the bracket to move the gear between the inoperative and operating positions, and a latch mechanism 26, 26b , 20e, 2b , 16a having first and second conditions, the first condition being a condition wherein the operating lever is locked in a position to cause the gear to assume the operating position and the second condition being a condition wherein the operating lever assumes another position to cause the gear to assume the inoperative position, wherein the latch mechanism is so arranged, that when, with the gear assuming the operating position, a force F is applied to the gear to urge the same in a direction from the operating position to the inoperative position, at least a part of the force is received by the transmission case through the latch mechanism.
