# Coating composition of an acrylic polymer, a dispersed acrylic polymer and an alkylated melamine crosslinking agent.

## Abstract
A coating composition that is used primarily as a clear finish over a colored or pigmented finish that are applied to automobile and truck bodies the composition contains as the film forming binder a an acrylic polymer b a self stabilized dispersed resin formed by poly merizing in solution the following constituents 1 an acrylic solution polymer, 2 monomers of alkyl methacrylate or acrylate and hydroxy ethyl acrylate or methacrylate, wherein either the acrylic solution polymer contains post reacted glycidyl methacrylate or acrylate or the monomers contain glycidyl methacrylate or acrylate, and c an alkylated melamine formaldehyde crosslinking agent.
