# Method and apparatus for changing the inclination or orientation of a longitudinal tab of an extruded weather strip for motor vehicles during its extrusion and weather strip thus obtained.

## Abstract
An extrusion head 10 is disclosed, for extruding weather strips 1 of elastomeric material, particularly for motor vehicles, of the type comprising an anchoring section 2 and a longitudinal sealing section in the form of a tab 3 coextruded with the anchoring section 2 . The extrusion head 10 comprises a die 11 with an extrusion orifice 12 having a shape corresponding to the cross section of the weather strip 1 to be extruded, and a deflector device 18 adapted, when actuated, to change the inclination or orienta tion of the sealing section 3 relative to the anchoring section 2 during extrusion.
