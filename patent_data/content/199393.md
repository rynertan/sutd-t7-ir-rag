## Description
The invention relates to compounds of the general formula I The compounds according to the invention have a cardiotonic activity and more particularly they show a very potent increase of the force and energy of the heart muscular contractions positive inotropic effect . The compounds of the invention may be prepared by any method known for the preparation of analogous compounds. A very suitable starting product for the preparation of the compounds I is a compound of the formula II Compounds of the invention in which R₃ represents the moiety Compounds of the invention in which R₃ represents a The nitrile of formula IV may be prepared in the usual manner from the corresponding carboxylic acid of formula II by converting the carboxylic acid into the corres ponding carboxamide followed by dehydration of the carboxamide. Compounds of the invention, in which R₃ represents a C N NH C NH NH₂ moiety, may most conveniently be prepared from an aldehyde of the formula The aldehyde of formula V can be prepared in various manners. For example the aldehyde may be manufactured by reducing the carboxylic acid of formula II in a well known manner. Another convenient synthesis for preparing the aldehyde consists of a mild reduction of the corresponding nitrile of formula II, e.g. with the aid of a metal hydride such as diisobutyl aluminiumhydride. The starting product of general formula II may be prepared by known methods. The attached flow sheet shows the preparation of a compound of formula II, wherein n 0. Chain length extension to n 1 and n 2 can be obtained by converting the carboxylic acid II n 0 into the corres ponding aldehyde n 0 and reacting said aldehyde with the appropriate phosphonate ylid using reaction conditions well known in carrying out the Wittig reaction. Appropriate phosphonate ylids are, for example, cyanomethylene triphenylphosphorane, carboxymethylene triphenylphosphorane and corres ponding alkyl esters, and 3 cyano propen 2 ylidene triphenylphosphorane. If necessary, the nitrile obtained through this Wittig reaction can be converted into the corresponding amide or carboxylic acid. Preferably most substituents at the benzo ring see R₁ are already present in one of the starting products. Nevertheless it is very well possible to convert a substituent R₁ into another substituent R₁ after the above mentioned condensation reactions. Thus, one or more hydroxy groups R₁ may be converted into the corresponding alkoxy groups or halogen in the usual manner. Furthermore two hydroxy groups may be converted into one methylene dioxy group and an alkoxy group may be hydrolysed to the corresponding hydroxy group. The compounds according to the general formula I may be converted into a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. The compounds of formula I which have an alkaline character may be obtained as the free base or as an acid addition salt. If required, however, the free base I can be prepared from the salt, for example by reaction with an alkaline compound or by means of an ion exchanger, whilst the free base I can be converted in a simple manner into an acid addition salt. Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts are derived from acids, such as hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, lactic acid, citric acid, ascorbic acid, salicylic acid, benzoic acid and methane sulphonic acid. Compounds I having an acidic nature may be converted into a metal salt, preferably an alkali metal salt such as the sodium salt. By the term alkyl 1 6C as used in the definitions of R₁, R₄, R₅ and R₆ is meant a saturated hydrocarbon with 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, tert. butyl, pentyl and isopentyl. An alkoxy 1 6C group is an alkyloxy group, in which the term alkyl has a similar meaning as above. By halogen in the definition of R₁ is preferably meant iodine, bromine, chlorine and fluorine. The most preferred halogens are chlorine and bromine. The said compounds in accordance with the invention can be administered either orally, locally or parenterally, preferably in a daily dose between 0.01 and 50 mg kg body weight. For this purpose the compounds are processed in a form suitable for oral, local or parenteral administration, for example a tablet, pill, capsule, solution, suspension, emulsion, paste or spray. The oral form is the most preferred form of administration. The most potent inotropic compounds are found amongst those compounds of formula I in which at least two substituents R₁ are present selected from hydroxy or alkoxy or in which at least one methylene dioxy group R₁ is present, whereby the dimethoxy or methoxy hydroxy substitution pattern is most preferred. Preferred compounds of formula I are moreover those compounds I in which X is CH₂ CH₂ . The position of the double bond between nitrogen and carbon in some of the moieties defined by R₃ of formula I cannot be clearly specified, because an equilibrium will prevail between The preferred R₃ moiety in the compounds of the invention is the N hydroxy carbox imidamide moiety.
