# Adsorber for haemoperfusion.

## Abstract
An adsorber for haemoperfusion is prepared by forming a porous membrane 10 to 400 Âµm thick containing an adsorbent in the form of powder or fine particles on a support. It is suitable for removing harmful substances contained in blood, has a high rate of adsorption, and does not readily shed the fine particles of the adsorbent material. The support plus adsorbent may be rolled up 3 and enclosed by a housing 6 and by elastomer 4 and an end support 5 at both ends.
