# Projection television apparatus having improved optical configuration.

## Abstract
A projection television apparatus comprises three monochromatic cathode ray tubes 1R, 1G, 1B , two di chroic mirrors 6 , and a lens 3 . Red, green and blue images from three tubes are combined into the colour image by the two dichroic mirrors 6 and the resulting image is enlarged and projected on the screen by a single lens 3 . The two dichroic mirrors 6 cross at a right angle to form the character X and each dichroic mirror is split in two sections 6R, 6R 6B, 6B on the line of intersection with the other mirror the two sections of each dichroic mirror 6R, 6R and 6B, 6B having different transmission characteristics so that colour shading is improved.
