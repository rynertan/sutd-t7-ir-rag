## Description
Reader printer and method of producing a permanent copy herein This invention relates to a microfilm reader printer. There are basically two types of microfilm reader which use an image recorded on microfilm as an input and project a magnified image of the film onto a screen for viewing by an observer. The first type, known as the back projection type, uses a translucent screen onto the rear surface of which the image is projected the observer thus viewing by transmitted light . The second type known as the front projection type, uses a screen illuminated from the same side as the observer, the observer thereby seeing the image via reflected light. Both types of reader can be provided with a facility permitting the user to produce a permanent copy of an image which he has been viewing and such a device is known as a reader printer.Normally the print facility makes use of the electrophotographic technique in which a uniformly charged photoconductive surface is exposed to the image to produce variations of charge distribution on the surface, the surface then being contacted with toner particles which are preferentially attracted to the surface in dependence on the charge image formed thereon, a permanent copy being produced from the array of toner particles thereby formed on the photoconductive surface. Reader printers operating on both the back projection and front production type are known and a considerable number of alternative designs are currently available. UK Patent Specification 1408581 discloses a rear projection reader printer in which a reservoir for sheets of copy paper is housed at the rear of the housing of the readerprinter, sheets leaving the reservoir in an upward direction to pass through a charging station and to be subsequently held by suction in a downwardly facing direction in an exposure station, where a charge image is produced on the sheet, the sheet finally being fed to an outlet above the translucent screen via a development station in which the charge image is converted to a permanent image of toner material. U.S. Patent Specification 4054379 discloses a front projection reader printer in which a reservoir for sheets of copy paper is housed generally horizontally at the rear of the housing of the reader printer, the sheets passing through a charging station and then upwardly over an inclined viewing screen within the housing. After creation of the charge image on a sheet on the viewing screen, it is fed upwardly again through a development station when a permanent image of toner material is produced on the sheet to exit from the housing at the top thereof. The properties which make one particular design of reader printer commercially more successful than another are difficult to define but, in general, desirable properties of a reader printer are a the ease with which a user can operate the device, b the reliability of the device in use, c the compactness of the design and thus the overall size of the device and, d the initial cost of the device. The present invention relates to a new design of reader printer which by virtue of its unique layout, which embodies the abovelisted desirable properties, is expected to have significant market impact. According to one aspect of the present invention a reader printer comprising a housing having a screen on which an image of a film is projected, and an electrpphotdgraphic print facility within the housing for producing a print on a copy sheet of an image projected on the screen which print facility comprises a charging station, an exposure station and a development station is characterised in that the path for a copy sheet through the housing extends downwardly from the charging station to the exposure station, whereby a uniformly charged copy sheet can drop into the exposure station prior to the formation of the charge image thereon. The invention is particularly applicable to a front projection reader printer in which the screen is formed by a plane surface located within the housing and viewed through a transparent window of the housing. By inclining the screen at an angle suitable for viewing through the window in practice an angle of 450 plus 250 or minus 100 is particularly convenient it has been found that a copy sheet can be slid into the desired exposure position on the screen by feeding it from a charging station disposed above the screen and allowing the sheet to drop from exit rolls of the charging station into the desired exposure position on the screen. Desirably the exposure position is defined by retractable edge stops which temporarily hold the charged copy sheet in position for the exposure and then release it for onward movement through the development station. The reader printers known from U.S. Patent Specification 4054379 and UK Patent Specification 1408581 both utilise upward movement of the copy sheet through the housing and thus necessitate some form of conveyor to positively feed the copy sheet into and out of the exposure station, such a conveying system adding to the complexity of these devices. A device in accordance with the present invention which utilises a downward path for a copy sheet through the component parts of the print facility, can be of much simpler design than the known devices thus permitting the production of a more compact and less expensive unit. Since the path of a copy sheet through a device according to the invention is in the downward direction, it is desirable to locate a reservoir for copy sheets at the top of the device and this reservoir can be coupled to the charging station by an automatic sheet feed or, in the case of a device designed for only occasional use of the print facility, for manual feed of sheets from the reservoir into the inlet end of the charging station. Since conventional copy sheets are rectangular with ends which are shorter than the sides and it is sometimes more convenient to produce the image on the sheet with an end uppermost and on other occasions with a side uppermost, a reader printer in accordance with the invention is desirably provided with a screen wide enough to receive the copy sheet with a side uppermost and to provide two sets of stop means on the screen, a lower stop means being effective if the copy sheet is fed through the charging station with an end thereof leading and a higher stop means effective if the copy sheet is fed through the charging station with a side thereof leading. Arranging the stop means in this way ensures that the device automatically arrests the downward movement of the copy sheet at the correct position on the screen. To ensure that the. copy sheet passes through the development station with its leading end normal to the direction of the movement of the sheet through the development station, it is desirable to provide an inlet nip for the development station which is defined between a pair of confronting rollers, to allow the copy sheet to drop against the upstream side of that nip when the stop means is withdrawn from the leading edge of the copy sheet after exposure has been effected in the exposure station, but to slightly delay the commencement of rotation of the confronting rollers by a time sufficient to ensure that the copy sheet has become stationary against the nip with its leading edge accurately aligned with the nip. A particularly compact arrangement of device is achieved if the outlet of the development station is on the front of the device below the viewing window. According to a further aspect of the present invention, a method of producing a copy of an image in a microfilm reader printer comprises gravity feeding an electrostatically charged copy sheet into an exposure station prior to expos ure therein, and gravity feeding the exposed copy sheet with a charge image formed thereon from the exposure station to the inlet of a development station in which the charge image can be converted into a toner image. Desirably the inlet to the development station is defined by the nip between a pair of rollers and the copy sheet dwells at the entrance to that nip, after its gravity feed thereto, prior to rotation of the rollers commencing to further advance the copy sheet through the development station. Suitably the charging of the copy sheet is effected in a charging station, the inlet of which comprises a pair of rollers defining a nip therebetween, one of the rollers of that pair being manually rotatable to permit at least initial manual feed of the copy sheet into the charging station. UK Patent Specification 1451709 discloses an electrophotographic camera e.g.for a cathode ray tube in which a sheet of copy paper can be dropped into an exposure station and then sequentially charged and exposed by a moving shutter arrangement which sweeps downwardly past the sheet. A development station is provided below the exposure station to receive a sheet as it leaves the exposure station. One embodiment of reader printer in accordance with the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a front view of the reader printer, Figure 2 is a schematic sectional view on the line II II through Figure 1, Figure 3 is a schematic view of the exposure station of the device shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2, Figure 4 is an enlarged view of the development station of the device of Figures 1 and 2, and Figure 5 is a sequencing diagram illustrating the manner in which the device of Figures 1 and 2 is operated in practice. Referring first to Figures 1 and 2 the device illustrated comprises a housing generally designated 1 which is mounted on a lamp box 2. Between the housing 1 and the lamp box 2 a conventional microfiche carrier 3 is located, this carrier being movable in conventional manner to locate any one of the images on a microfiche mounted in the carrier, over the optical axis of a light beam projected up from the box 2 into the housing 1 through a lens system 4. The lamp box 2, carrier 3 and lens system 4 are of conventional design and will not be further described. The front face of the housing 1 consists essentially of a viewing window 5 which is covered with a sheet of transparent coloured plastics material 6, the colour of the material being selected having regard to the sensitivity range of the photoconductive material used on the copy sheets in a manner as will be described hereafter. The window 5 gives an observer seated outside the housing a clear view of an inclined screen 7 located at the far side of a generally pentagonally shaped viewing space 8. The material 6 of the window 5 and the screen 7 constitute two sides of this space 8, the remaining three sides serving as a reservoir 9 for copy sheets, a charging station 10 and a development station 11. Adjacent the reservoir 9 is a plane reflecting mirror 12 which reflects the image of the microfiche onto the screen 7.The screen 7 defines an exposure station generally designated 7 When used as a reader, the observer views the selected microfiche through the window 5 and the coloured sheet of material 6, the image appearing on the screen 7 which is inclined at 450 to the horizontal, a convenient angle at which to view the image. Other angles between 700 and 350 to the horizontal appear to be usable. When the observer wishes to take a permanent copy of a particular image, he can lift a hinged top flap 13 on the upper surface of the housing 1, remove a copy sheet from the reservoir and insert this into an inlet slit 14 above the reservoir 9 until the leading edge of the sheet comes to rest against the nip of a pair of inlet rollers 15 and 16.One of these inlet rollers 15 in the drawing terminates in a knob 17 exposed to one side of the housing and rotation of the knob will feed the copy sheet between the rollers 15 and 16 further into the charging station 10. Just downstream of the inlet rollers 15 and 16 is a pivoted finger 18 which is displaced by the leading edge of the fed in copy sheet, deflection of this finger from its normal rest position actuating a main drive motor 19 shown schematically in Figure 2 which powers the various components of the device in the manner hereinafter to be described.When the motor 19 is operating, the rollers 15 and 16 are powered therefrom so that further movement of the copy sheet through the device is effected automatically once the finger 18 has been deflected by the leading edge of the manually fed in sheet. Downstream of the finger 18 is a corona charging station 20 and downstream of that, a further pair of feed rollers 21 and 22. The copy sheet is of zinc oxide coated paper and is fed into the slit 14 with its coated surface facing downwards so that it is the downward facing surface leaving the corona unit 20 which is charged with the uniform electrostatic charge.Thus it is feed roller 21 which contacts the uniformly charged surface of the copy sheet and this roller is made of suitable electrically insulating material to prevent disturbance of the charged surface by its contact therewith. An arcuate deflec tor plate 23 downstream of the feed rollers 21 and 22 encourages the leading end of the fed sheet to turn downwardly and, as the feed rollers 21 and 22 advance the sheet, lower the charged sheet down past the inclined screen 7. Adjacent the bottom edge of the screen 7, two sets of stop means are provided, the lower of these being a first projecting edge 24 and the upper, a pair of bent up edges 25. From Figure 3 it can be seen that the edges 25 are spaced apart sufficiently to permit the leading edge of a copy sheet lowered over the screen 7 with its shorter end leading to pass between the edges 25 so that the leading end is brought to rest against the edge 24. If, however, the copy sheet had been fed into the slit 14 with the longer side of the sheet leading, it would be the outer edge portions of this longer side which engaged the spaced apart edges 25 thus bringing the copy sheet to rest at a somewhat higher position on the screen 7 than in the case where it was the shorter end of the sheet which was the leading end. The spacing between the lower and upper stop means is equal to one half the difference between the length and the width of the size of copy sheet for which the printer has been designed to operate i.e. a distance of 297 210 43.5 mm 2 in the case of A4 paper . The inner extremities of the spaced apart edges 25 pro jecting through the screen 7 are curved downwardly to ensure that if a copy sheet, in its fall over the screen 7, moves slightly off line, the curved portions of the edges 25 will deflect it back between the edges 25 so that it comes to rest against the lower edge 24. The edges 24 and 25 are formed on a flap member 26 which is hinged below the screen 7 on the line 27. A cam member 28, rotatable in the direction of the arrow A during operation of the motor 19, bears against the underside of the flap member 26 during an initial part of its rotation, pushing the latter up into contact with the underside of the screen 7 and thereby causing the edges 24 and 25 to project beyond the upper face of the screen 7. As the flap member 26 moves into this upper position, a pivoted finger 29 locks it into this upper position. Once the finger is locked in place, the flap member 26 is no longer held in its upper position by the cam member 28 so that when the cam surface retracts from the underside of the flap member it remains in the upper position held there by the finger 29.Release of the flap member 26 is effected by means of a solenoid 30 actuating a plunger 31, the plunger bearing against the finger 29. When electrical energy is supplied to the solenoid 30 at the appropriate moment in the processing cycle as will hereinafter be described , the plunger 31 moves the finger 29 out of its recess in the flap member 26, releasing the latter and allowing it to fall back into the position illustrated in Figure 2. Downstream Qf the screen 7 is the development station 11 and this comprises five rollers numbered 32 36. The path of the copy sheet through the development station is shown more clearly in Figure 4, the sheet entering the station through the nip between rollers 32 and 33 and leaving the station through the nip between the squeegee rollers 35 and 36.Since roller 32 contacts the copy sheet on the side thereof that supports the charge image, it must be made of appropriate electrically insulating material. The upper squeegee roller 35 is pressed into contact with the lower squeegee roller 36 by a further roller 34. Between the nips of the roller pairs 32, 33 and 35, 36, the copy sheet is made to curve over the upper surface of a shallow trough 39 and below a liquid developer dispensing bar 38. The shallow trough 39 fills with a liquid developer from the bar 38 prior to the approach of the leading edge of a copy sheet. As the sheet passes through the development station the charge image on its upper surface is converted into an image of toner particles by virtue of that upper surface being contacted by developer issuing from the bar 38. A reservoir for developer liquid is provided at 40 and a bottle 41 supplies fresh liquid developer to the reservoir as this is used up in the development process. A pump and ducting not shown are provided to circulate developer from the reservoir 40 to the dispensing bar 38, surplus developer draining back into the reservoir 40 when the pump is operating. The printed copy sheet, after passing through the nip between the squeegee rollers 35 and 36, enters an outlet passage 42 which terminates in a slot 43 located below the window 5. It will be noted, therefore, that the optical path from the lens system 4 to the mirror 12 passes across the outlet passage 42 and appropriate apertures must be provided in the walls of this passage to permit the light beams to pass therethrough. Although no image can be projected onto the screen 7 when a copy sheet is passing through the outlet passage 42, this does not represent a disadvantage in practice, since a. copy sheet is only in the out let passage in the final stage of a print sequence. Figure 5 shows the sequence employed during a print operation, the letters on the left hand side of the sequence diagram representing the lamp L , the solenoid 30 S , the drive motor 19 M , the corona unit 20 C and the toner pump TP . The print cycle is divided into three sections, the first representing feed of copy material through the charging station 10 F , the second,exposure of the charged copy material on the screen 7 E and finally, development of the copy sheet in the development station 11 D . The cam 28 controls the sequences in the F and D sections, in the course of a single 3600 rotation. The period of the print cycle allocated to exposure is variable it depends upon the intensity of the image projected on the screen 7 and this variability has been indicated by the broken lines in that section of the diagram. It is significant to note that the short period indicated X, between stages E and D, represents a delay between operation of the solenoid and thus withdrawal of the stop means which is holding the copy sheet away from the nip of the inlet pair of rollers 32 and 33 and the re energisation of the motor 19, which results in rotation of the rollers 32 and 33.This short delay which in practice need be no more than approximately one second ensures that the leading edge of the copy sheet is stationary against the nip when the roller pair commences rotation, thus ensuring that the leading edge is normal to the direction of feed of the copy sheet through the development station. Although the device illustrated employs manual feed of copy sheets from the reservoir 9 into the inlet slit 14, it will be appreciated that the disposition of this reservoir adjacent the upstream end of the charging station 10 makes it a simple matter to modify the design and incorporate automatic paper feed from the upstream end of the reservoir 9 into the downst ream end of the charging station 10. The provision of the coloured sheet material 6 in the window 5 means that it is not necessary to close off the window 5 during exposure of charged material resting on the screen 7. This is because it.is possible to select the material 6 so that its transmission wavelength band corresponds to an insensitive region of the charged copy sheet. This is a significant advantage in practice, since it permits a much simpler design of device, there being no need to provide a movable shutter to block out ambient light from the viewing space 8. The marks 44, adjacent to the slit 14, aid in centring the copy sheet in the slit when it is fed, end first, into the device. If desired, the edges 45 of the slit which are dimensioned with regard to the width of a sheet fed side first into the slit 14 can be adjustable and can move in sy, .metrically about the centre line of the slit to ensure accurate feed of end first fed sheets. Knob 44 controls the focus of the lens system 4 and knob 45, the length of the exposure in the print cycle.An on off switch 46 is also provided. Although the invention has been described with reference to a front projection type of reader printer, it is possible to utilise the method of the invention on a rear projection type of device, the copy sheet then being fed in front of the screen and being illuminated from behind.
