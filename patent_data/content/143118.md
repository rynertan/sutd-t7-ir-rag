# Heat sensitive heater wire.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a heat sensitive heater wire comprising a conductor for a first electrode 6 , an internal function layer 7 , a conductor for a second electrode 8 , an external function layer 9 , a conductor for a third electrode 10 , and an insulating housing 5 which are formed in said order, one of the internal function layer and the external function layer comprising a heat generating layer having a self temperature controliabiiity, the other comprising a high molecular temperature sensitive layer or a temperature fuse layer. If this heat sensitive heater wire is used, a surface heating device of high safety free from abnormal overheat and local overheat can be obtained.
