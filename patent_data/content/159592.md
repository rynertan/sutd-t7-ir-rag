# Distributed arbitration for multiple processors.

## Abstract
A method of arbitrating for N processors P₀ P₇ request ing access to a shared resource 10 utilizing 2 log₂N shared variables 16, 18, C₀, C₁, T Arbitration with fairness can be obtained by dividing pro cessors into two fairness groups and assigning a turn to one of the groups. A processor is allowed into arbitration if the turn belongs to its fairness group. Upon completing access, the processor is assigned to the other fairness group. The turn is changed when no processor of that fairness group is request ing access.
