# PROCESS FOR REDUCING THE CONCENTRATION OF CARBONATE IN AN AQUEOUS SOLUTION AND PROCESS FOR ETCHING

## Abstract
A process for reducing the concentration of carbonate in an aqueous solution is disclosed which includes contacting the aqueous solution with a strongly basic ion exchange resin. The process is preferably used for treating aqueous solutions used for etching polyimides which solutions contain an alkali metal hydroxide.
