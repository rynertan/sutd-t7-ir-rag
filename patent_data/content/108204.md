# Method for diffusing impurities and semiconductor devices fabricated by said method.

## Abstract
A semiconductor device is fabricated by selectively providing on a surface of a semiconductor body 10 a plurality of impurity diffusion sources 12, 13 each contain ing an n type impurity comprising phosphorus and arsenic, at least two of said impurity diffusion sources 12, 13 containing phosphorus and arsenic at a different ratio. The impurity is diffused by a single thermal diffusion step from each impurity diffusion source 12, 13 into the semiconduc tor body 10 to form a plurality of n type regions 14, 15 in the semiconductor body 10 . At least two of the n type regions 14, 15 will then have different diffusion depths.
