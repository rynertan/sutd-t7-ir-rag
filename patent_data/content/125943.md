# An indium phosphide boron phosphide heterojunction bipolar transistor.

## Abstract
A heterojunction bpolar transistor having an n type epitaxial indium phosphide collector layer 16 grown on a semi insulating indium phosphide substrate 18 with an n buried layer 20 , a p type indium phosphide base 26 and an epitaxpial, n type boron phosphide wide gap emitter 24 . The p type base region 26 is formed by ion implantation of magnesium ions into the collector layer 16 . The transistor is applicable to millimeter wave applications due to the high electron mobility in the indium phosphide base. The wide gaps of both the boron phosphide 2.2eV and indium phos phide 1.34eV permit operation up to 350 C. The transistor is easily processed using metal organic chemical vapor deposi tion MO CVD and standard microelectronic techniques.
