# METHOD AND EQUIPMENT FOR MAKING STRANDED ROPES

## Abstract
A stranded rope 12 of large size is made by assembling a plurality of strands 10 and a core 11 side by side along a track 13 securing the leading ends in a clamp 14 securing the trailing ends in spaced anchorages 17, 18 applying tension to the strands 10 and core 11 guiding the strands 10 intermediate the clamp 14 and anchorages 17, 18 into the closed rope array round the core 11 by means of a closing die 20 on a trolley 19 moving the trolley 19 from the clamp 14 to the anchorages 17, 18 rotating the clamp 14 progressively as the trolley 19 moves progressively rotating the trailing ends of the strands 10 and core 11 progressively in the same direction as the clamp 14 securing all the strands 10 and the core 11 together adjacent the trailing ends and releasing the tension from the strands and the core.
