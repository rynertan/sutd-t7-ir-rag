## Description
The present invention relates to a data input output terminal equipment which is connected to a host machine host computer communicably wherein at least one program stored in the host machine is loaded prior to data input output and data are input and or output under the control of the program loaded. Conventionally, there have been put on the market portable data input output terminal equipment suitable for controlling the stock, checking load unload of goods or the like. However, the conventional data input output terminal equipment is developed only for an exclusive use in which application programs thereof are so designated as to be adapted for a specified category of business and for business usage therein. Thus, application programs have to be designed according to every specified category of business such as a transportation service, a wholesale business etc. and, even in the same specified category of business, according to every service such as receipt service of goods, shipping service of goods etc. Accordingly, even in the same category of business, a variety of terminal equipments are provided each for every service thereof. This causes increase in number of the equipments and leads to possible misuse among them and a lower utility thereof. From Medical Biological Engineering Computing, vol. 19 1981 May no. 3, pages 257 261, a data input output terminal equipment connected to a host computer is known. The known equipment is designed for an emergency medical care information system comprising a clinical computer network through which a plurality of such equipments placed at clinical institutes are connected to the control center host computer. The host computer collects data relating e.g. to the waiting status of doctors in charge for each department so that the system can give directions for taking an acutely ill patient to an appropriate hospital as quickly as possible. In the known equipment, the user can communicate with the system according to a plurality of application programs registered in the system. For each service a separate application program is required to load in the data input output terminal equipment. Thus, kind and number of the application programs are limited to those registered beforehand. It is the object of the invention to provide a data input output terminal equipment which can be adapted to any category of business and to a plurality of services thereof without loading a specific application program being required therefore. According to the invention, the data input output equipment comprises According to the present invention, it becomes possible to generate a plurality of service application programs by designating system parameters included in one or more basic or common programs loaded from the host computer so as to adapt programs to the specified category of business and for each service thereof. In the program setting mode, a variety of functions are selectably designated and set appropriately according to the kind of category of business, the type of service to be done thereabout and the custom of trade regarding thereto etc. The present invention will now be described more in detail by way of examples and with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Fig. 1 and 2 show a block diagram of the system and construction of the data input output terminal equipment, and Fig. 3 shows a front view of the equipment. The data input output equipment EOST communicably is connected to a host machine HM and comprises a mode setting means A for designating at least a program setting mode and an execution mode, a RAM means B for storing at least one basical program being loaded from the host machine, a parameter setting means C for designating parameters included in the basical program loaded in the program setting mode to define a plurality of applcation programs, each of which is available for a specified service, a RAM means T for memorizing parameters designated, a RAM means E for memorizing entry data, and a service selecting means F for designating one of application programs in the execution mode. In particular, the present data terminal is comprised of a central processing unit hereinafter referred to CPU 1 being composed of one chip micro processor One more RAM 17 for programs and a pen reader 18 for reading bar codes hereinafter referred to TPR 18 can be equipped as optional equipment. CPU 1 is connected via serial interface 12 and or parallel interface 13, to a host computer 19 and or another data input output terminal equipment 20. As is shown in Fig. 3, ten numeral keys NK i i 0 9 and twenty function keys FK j j 1 20 are provided on the key board 5. The mode switch 9 is a slide switch for selecting either one of modes A and B. PRAM 3 and DRAM 4 are always backed up by a battery means not shown stored in the equipment. The first and second system switches 7 and 8 are arranged operably in the battery chamber 21 each of which is a switch having three selectable positions A, B and C. The first and second system switches 7 and 8 are used for designating a specified mode together with the mode switch 9. Figs. 5 and 6 show a flow chart of main routine being proceeded by CPU 1. As is shown in Fig. 5, when the power switch 6 is turned on, the system is initialized first and is checked whether programs have been loaded or not and whether they are normal or not. Then, the voltage of the battery is checked. When the battery is normal, the mode to be proceeded by CPU 1 is identified. The mode is designated by a combination of the first and second system switches 7 and 8 and the mode switch 9, as is shown in Table 1. Five modes can be designated as follows. The mode for setting sum check codes into a predetermined memory area after calculating sum check modes of programs stored in PRAM 3 and of system parameters stored in DRAM 4. The mode for testing hardwares such as ROM, RAM, the liquid crystal display, the key board and the buzzer by proceeding a diagnosis program stored in ROM 2. The application mode is divided into parameter setting mode and execution mode. The mode for designating specifications with respect to each of services such as data entry services maximum seven kinds can be set , data output service one kind , data input service one kind , data collection service one kind as an optional service through setting or designating parameters. The mode for executing each service program mentioned above according to operations necessary for initial setting, initial registration and selection of service such as data entry services, data output service and so on. The mode for loading programs and parameters into PRAM 3 and DRAM 4 which are transmitted from the host machine and or other data terminal equipment. The mode for unloading programs and parameters having been stored in PRAM 3 and DRAM 4 to the host machine and or other data terminal equipment. Among these modes cited above, the program setting mode is the most characteristic mode according to the present invention. In this mode, each service program can be made through setting parameters as will become apparent hereinafter. In other words, the present equipment is applicable for each of a variety of categories of business commonly, since a plurality of service programs can be made most appropriately according to the category of business taking user s requirements into considerations. Therefore, the program setting mode will be explained hereinafter particularly. The key arrangement for this mode is shown in Fig. 7. This key arrangement is fixed in the mode. In the arrangement, keys to be operated are ten keys 0 to 9 , six alphabetic keys A to F , three function keys FK1 to FK3 and a clear key CE . Setting operation is done always according to a key sequence as shown in Fig. 8. In Fig. 8, the operation NK1 is a key operation for designating a job number JOB for instance, of 4 digits , the operation NK2 is a key operation for designating an item number ITEM for instance, of 2 digits and the operation NK3 is a key operation for designating data for setting parameters which are predetermined according to every parameter to be set. Function key FK1 transfers the key operation from NK1 to NK2 upon the first and push down thereof and effect to display the content of the job being designated by JOB upon the second push down thereof. Function key FK2 transfers the key operation automatically to a next key operation for designating ITEM or JOB upon every push down thereof. Function key FK3 effects to display the content of the next job upon the push down thereof. Upon check of jobs designated, function key FK3 is pushed down successively. Fig. 9 shows the data format for the memory for registering data being used for data entry during the execution mode. The initial registration record and service code record are fixed after having been set once according to the system. Each of heading, detail and footing records is fixed with respect to each data entry service selected. The initial registration, service code, heading and footing records may be not necessarily set. Each record except for the service code record is comprised of a plurality of items fields as is shown in Fig. 10. The heading record is provided for memorizing heading data such as a sum of individual quantity as for the quantity, a sum of individual amount of money as for the amount of money, date and time upon inputting and or outputting data or the like. Parameters for setting the heading record can be designated through JOB 0101 to 0114 and ITEM 10 to 14 . Table 2 shows the manner for designating parameters of the heading record. Detail record is defined for memorizing particular data such as a unit price of an individual article, and or a quantity thereof. The manner for designating parameters of the detail record is shown in Tables 3 1 and 3 2. The footing record is provided for finishing or completing detail records in such a manner as to memorize, for instance the total amount of money summed up all through detail records which is defined at a position next to the final detail record. The manner for designating parameters of the footing record is shown in Table 4. Next, formats for setting these records will be explained according to Tables 2, 3 1, 3 2 and 4. Each length number of digits necessary for every item is designated by one of integers 01 to 15 . C D check codes, symbols such as decimal point . , signs etc. and item partition code are included in calculation of the number of digits. The length of each item designated is assigned to the memory for registering data. Each area for displaying input data to monitor them upon input with use of key board or input from the bar code reader TPR. The number of line on which the data is displayed, the beginning digit on the line from which the data is displayed and the length of digits are designated respectively. There is designated whether item partition code is to be memorized or not upon memorizing each item in the memory for registering data. When the item partition code is to be memorized, the code is designated with one of numerals or alphabets shown in Table 2. It is to be noted that the codes in the case of 4 BIT is differentiated from those in the case of 8 BIT. A key code is designated with a number of two digits to indicate that the input of the final item has been completed. When the key code designated is input, all inputs regarding the item is supposed to be finished. The present system provides two calendar functions. One is a function being able to write the calendar into the initial registration item and the other is a function being able to read the calendar of the item in the heading or detail record. It can be designated whether the calendar function is necessary or not. When the calendar function is designated, one of three types of the calendar date , time and date and time is specified. It can be designated whether the input with use of TPR is possible or not. Since the input with use of ten keys is always possible, multiple inputs are possible when the input with use of TPR is designated. The content of the calendar is checked by inequalities such as 00 hours 23, 00 minutes 59. The extent check is provided for checking whether the data input for instance the amount of the money, is within the extent defined between an upper and lower limits or not. One combination can be designated among many, for instance ten combinations with respect to the upper limit and the lower limit which are defined as in the Table 5. If the calendar check is not designated with respect to one item, multiple extent checks maximum 5 checks become possible. Upon multiple extent checks, every check is done with use of OR logic and , in every check, only a significant number except for signs and the decimal point is checked. This is C D check against input items. As is shown in Fig. 11, C D check can be done about an input item to the head of which other item is added. Fig. 11 shows a method for assigning weights when five numbers n₁, n₂, n₃, n₄ and n₅ are designated as weights therefor. The content of C D check can be specified in Table 6 as a C D check, table in which maximum six kinds of C D check can be defined. Parameters to be designated are the number of C D check table, whether or not other item is added to, and, if other item is to be added, the number of other item. In the comparison check, data input are compared with data having been memorized in the memory for initial setting. As the result of the comparison, data input is processed duly when both data correspond to each other. When no correspondence between both data is obtained, an error message is displayed. This check is an equal check for checking whether the total value obtained through items in the heading or the detail records is equal to the value obtained by a totalizer provided in this system. Fig. 12 shows an example of the sum check. In this example, total number of clients obtained in the system totalizer by adding each number of clients being input into items of ITEM 1 to 3 respectively is compared with the total number of clients input into the item of ITEM 5. The sum check is available to both of the heading and detail records. One of numbers of the system totalizer 01 to 04 is designated for the sum check. The total value sum value is cleared when the sum check has been finished. The system totalizer will be more fully disclosed in section c entitled Use of System Totalizer . This check can be done with respect to input items of the heading and detail records. In the case that the check is designated about an input item, the following processions are executed. Fig. 13 shows a composition of the master file. A line number, top digit number and a number of digits for the display of each item are designated. If the line number is designated to 0 , the corresponding item is not displayed. The position, length and editorial type for the display with respect to each item of the master data are designated according to Table 9 and Table 10. In Table 10, parameters about editorial types for the display are assigned as follows Contents being displayed are cleared after final items of the heading or detail records have been input. Master Data Search Check will be disclosed particularly in the section entitled Master File Functions . This check is possible only about input items of the detail record. In the case that the check is designated about the input item, the following processions are done. First, the input data of a positive integer is edited in the manner same to that of memory format and detail records of the data registration memory are searched, from the top thereof, with the key obtained as the result of the edition mentioned above. Editorial method for the display is as follows Then, the following processions will be done. It is possible to designate the key for deleting detail records of the data registration memory or the key for not deleting those. Memory editorial method about the heading record, the detail record and the footing record are different from each other in designating method about parameters. Hereinafter, the memory editorial method for the detail record will be explained particularly. First, the position of a decimal point on the memory is designated by one of integers 00 , 01 and 02 When 00 is designated, any decimal point is not assigned on the memory . Data input is edited referring to the position of the decimal point designated as a standard therefor. In this case, the portion overflowed from the memory area is cut off and blank portion of the area is filled with zeros. When 00 is designated, data are edited referring to the most right hand position of the area as a standard. It depends on the designation of the system parameter whether the position of the decimal point is memorized or not. When 10 is designated, the last one digit C D value of the input data is deleted and the input data deleted is memorized in the state of Flush Right . The overflowed portion is cut off and blank portion is filled with zeros. When 2n is designated, C D value is added to the last digit of the input data and, then, the input data is memorized in the state of Flush Right . The parameter n n 1 6 designates one of item numbers in C D Table. Also, the overflowed portion is cut off and the blank portion is filled with zeros. When 30 is designated, the input data is coupled or synthesized with the input data of other item of the heading record and or the detail record. In this case, code 30 is first designated and the item number of the item to be synthesized or coupled is designated. In the present system, four totalizers 14 digits of the integer portion and two digits of the decimal fraction are provided and can be used for the following objects. These method can be designated in combination with at least one input item of the heading, the detail and the footing records as is shown in Table 11. In the case that individual value is input into individual item 1 to n and the sum of these individual values is input into the item therefor, as is shown in Fig. 16 a , an equal check between the sum being input and the sum obtained in the system totalizer is done. In this case, it is impossible to input the sum data into the corresponding item from the system totalizer without operating ten keys. In the case that individual value is input into individual item of the detail record and the sum of these individual values is input into one item of the footing record, as is shown in Fig. 16 b , the sum having been input is compared with the sum data obtained in the system totalizer during input of individual value. In this case, the sum obtained in the system totalizer can be input into said one item of the footing record without entry by ten keys. Referring to Fig. 16 c , the sum data of individual value to be input into individual item of the detail record is input first into the item n of the heading record and the sum data is saved into a system totalizer upon the input thereof. Thereafter, individual data is input into individual item l to n of the detail record. These individual data are added in other system totalizer. In this case, the sum data having been saved is compared with the sum obtained in the other system totalizer in order for equal check. With respect to the detail record, four fashions for inputting data with keys can be set. One fashion is set for the heading record or the footing record. The total number of digits is that of a significant number of the data and therefore, does not include the decimal point . and signs and the like. Maximum 2 can be designated. If data has not any decimal fraction, 00 is designated. 0 The number of digits is fixed and only positive integer can be input. Sign and decimal point . are impossible to input. 1 A positive integer with an arbitrary number of digits can be input but sign and decimal point . can not be input. 2 A positive or negative integer with an arbitrary number of digits can be input but decimal point . can not be input. 3 A positive real number with an arbitrary number of digits can be input but sign can not be input. 4 A positive or negative real number with an arbitrary number of digits can be input. It is designated whether or not the deposition by ten keys can be omitted. In the case that the omission is designated, it is designated whether the omission is regarded as 0 or 1 . When it is designated, the entry with use of only the end key becomes possible. Input Data are flushed to the right and all of blank digits are filled with zeros. Input data are flushed to the left, all of blank digits are filled with one of filler codes HEX 0 9 . Fig. 14 shows an example of data synthesis with respect to the item 2. As shown in Fig. 14, in the case that a classification code is to be input into upper three digits of the item 2 and an article code is to be input into lower five digits thereof, the article code input into lower five digits at this time is synthesized with the classification code having been input into heading three digits of the preceding record. In this case, the top digit P of the data to be replaced with a new data is designated according to the key input fashion as is disclosed in ITEM 11. The synthesized data classification code article code is input into the item 2 of the present pending record. The data synthesis method as mentioned above is able to simplify entry operation in such a case that all data have a portion common to each other. Fig. 15 shows a flow chart for data synthesizing upon data entry in the execution mode. When data entry is begun by operations of ten keys or with TPR, input data is displayed on the display 11 and at the step 101, it is decided whether the data synthesizing is designated or not. In the case of NO , other editions are processed as are designated in the step 102. In the case of YES , the data synthesizing is done at step 103 as is stated above. The data synthesized is displayed so as to be confirmed it at step 104. At step 105, a variety of checks are made as stated hereinafter. When all of checks are cleared, memory edition is executed and data are saved in the Write Buffer. These processes are repeated until the data entry of the last item have been completed step 107 . The data thus input and or synthesized are memorized in DRAM at step 108 and, then, data entry for the next record is started. If the designation of e 2 or e 3 is designated, data edited are displayed again on the monitoring area after completion of data entry with use of keys. Checks above mentioned are executed against data having been edited already. If data input is finished with one scanning of TPR, the entry fashion is designated in ITEM 14. If data input is finished after a plurality of scannings of TPR, the entry fashion is designated in ITEM 15. The designation of the entry fashion made essentially by designating JOB in Table 12 for TPR input. Referring to Table 12, a number of digits of data to be read, a position from which the effective data are started, a length of the effective data, existence of partition code and partition code itself, the type of bar code NW 7, JAN 8, 13 digits , 2 out of 5, INTERLEAVED 2 out 5, the table number of C D Check Digit , the digit number of the decimal portion of a positive , negative and real data are designated respectively. In the case of a plurality of scannings, conditions for completion of input are designated. The conditions are as follows In order to prevent errors upon reading bar codes, data having been read are checked by C D check method. In the case that data is input by ten keys, C D check is done in order to prevent deposition mistakes similarly. However, the C D check is available only for integers. Accordingly, it is impossible to do C D check about data including symbols such as a decimal point, signs etc. In the system according to the present invention, there is assigned a special number to each symbol in order to make C D check possible. Namely, the symbol included in the data is replaced to the special number designated upon calculation of C D. Manner for designating these numbers is shown in the item 3 of Table 12. In the item 3, three integers of two digits 00 99 are assigned to sign, sign and the decimal point respectively. Fig. 17 shows a flow chart for C D check. when a real number, for example 1234.67 is input from TPR at step 102, it is decided if C D check is to be done or not at step 103. When C D check is to be done, sign and . decimal point in the input data are replaced respectively to decimal values designated, for example 11 and 31 , at step 104. Then, C D value is calculated with respect to the number obtained as the result of the replacement, for example 1112343167 , at step 105. At step 106, the result thus obtained is compared with C D value. If the former is not equal to the latter, Error is indicated on the display. This idea is applicable to data including the symbols , S and the like, indicating the currency of individual country. The terminal equipment according to the present invention is able to provide a variety of functions selectively in addition to those functions as are disclosed in the foregoing. Hereinafter, main functions will be explained separately. As is clear from the foregoing, the present system is characterized in that a plurality of service programs can be made through designation of system parameters and can be executed according to system parameters designated. Therefore, system parameters are required a very high reliability substantially equal to that of programs. Conventionally, system parameters have not been checked although check about programs has been done with use of a checking method such as Sum Check . In the system according to the present invention, check about system parameters can be possible as well as the check about programs in order to avoid mal functions. As is shown in Fig. 6, the check about parameters are executed after the program routine has been completed and the power switch was turned off. Namely, when the power switch was turned off after setting of system parameters has been completed, Power OFF Routine POR is executed for checking parameters having been set during program setting mode. In the routine POR, check code such as Check Sum Code is calculated above the memory area in which parameters having been set are memorized and check code obtained has been set at a predetermined memory area. Thereafter, when the power switch is turned on in order to execute a service program mode through designations of parameters or when a function key is pushed down to start an application program, first is judged whether the programs are loaded or not and, then, Sum Check is done as is indicated in the step SUM PD of Fig. 5. In this Sum Check routine, both programs and parameters are checked respectively. Accordingly an indication of Check Sum Errors is displayed and the execution of the program is stopped, if there is at least an undesirable change caused by an unknown origin in the parameter memory area. In the case that the execution of the program is stopped, each parameter is checked in the Parameter Setting Mode, for instance by comparing each parameter being displayed with that in the data setting table. Thus, according to this function, undesirable change in system parameters can be found before the run of the program and, therefore, correct service program can be executed always. The master filing function according to the present system is comprised of a series of functions as follows According to these functions, there are obtained a variety of merits as follows Master file is defined as an assembly of records having a predetermined same length, as is shown in Fig. 18, which has a numeral data indicating the beginning digit of the first record thereof as the top data. Each record thereof contains, as shown in Fig. 19, a top data indicating the beginning digit of a key data Mkey and the key data MKey through which the master file is searched. The master file is set according to the Tables 13 and 14. Each record is comprised of ten items from the first to tenth item. The length and beginning digit are designated according to tables mentioned above. Formats for displaying master data as references are set by designating a display line li, beginning digit di and digit length mi of each item i at the item 21 in JOB 4301 of Table 13. Further, editorial method for display is designated according to Table 15. Fig. 20 shows an example of the display. The master file of the terminal equipment is made by reading the corresponding caster file of the host machine serially or parallelly. Fig. 21 shows a flow chart showing a manner for data entry using master files. In the flow shown in Fig. 21, when the job A for receiving the master file is chosen, the present terminal equipment is connected to the host machine with the serial or parallel receiving cable. When the key therefor is operated, the master file of the host machine is read out and is memorized in the memory area of the terminal equipment reserved therefor to construct the master file therein. The master file can be made with respect to each service such as an ordering service, stock management or the like. When the job B for correcting master file is chosen in Fig. 21, the master file having been made can be corrected manually monitoring data thereof. When the job C for data entry is chosen and the kind of service ordering, stock management, etc. to which the data entry is to be done is designated, the master data search check is executed as follows. This check, however, can be done only when the master data search check code is designated to 6000 at item 11 for designating check method of the Table 3 1. The check can be done in two modes C I and C II as shown in Fig. 21. In this mode, the key data MKey through which the master data is searched is designated at the step 401. Parameters for the key data in the record are set according to Table 16. The mode switch is operated to set mode and the check is executed according to the flow chart shown in Fig. 22. When data of one record were input at step 501, one of function keys FK is operated. At step 502, it is decided if the search check for the master data should be done or not and, when the check is to be done, it is made by searching about each record whether or not the key data MKey of the record of the master file is correspond to the key data R key having been entered. When the MKey of the record is correspond to the RKey, the record having the MKey is displayed according to the display format mentioned above. Referring to the content displayed, data for other item are entered. When the entry operation for one record is finished, data for next record are entered and the search check is done therefor. If there is no record having the key data MKey which correspond to the key data RKey, error is displayed or the record is neglected according to the parameters designated. In this mode, the first record of the master file is displayed at step 406 in Fig. 21. When the data displayed is not data intended, the feed forward function key is pushed and the second record is displayed. Thus, records of the master file are monitored successively. When the data intended is displayed, a predetermined function key FK is pushed at step 407, the key data MKey of the corresponding record of the master file is read at step 408 and is memorized as the corresponding item of the entry data. Continuously, data for other item are entered referring to the data displayed at step 409. Alternately, data of other item of the record in the master file can be memorized as they are, similarly to the case of the key data. When the data entry for one record is finished, next data entry is continued for the next record. Data being treated in the terminal equipment can be integers and or real numbers. In the case that the data is a real number, it may be a data having a decimal point of a variable digit or of a fixed digit. Upon memorizing these data of many types, data of an integer or of a real number of a fixed digit is not necessary to memorize the decimal point itself although it should be memorized with respect to the data of a real number of a variable decimal point. Contrary to the above, it may be advantageous for processing data between another data terminal to memorize data about the decimal point even in the case of an integer or a real number of a fixed decimal point. Thus, the necessity of memorizing a decimal data depends on conditions under which data are processed. Accordingly, it is desirable to be able to choose if data about the decimal point is to be memorized or not according to properties or conditions of data to be processed. Further, the volume of memory can be reduced when compared with the case in that every data about the decimal point is memorized without any exception. Fig. 23 shows a flow chart therefor. As shown in Fig. 23, when the data entry job is selected at step 101, application program corresponding to the data entry job is called at step 102, and data are entered with use of ten keys at step 103 or through TPR at step 104 . At step 105, it is decided if data should be memorized dependent upon the position of a decimal point. In the case of NO , input data are edited according to the editorial method designated Flush Right or Flush Left etc. and are memorized. In the case of YES , it is decided if the data about the decimal point should be memorized or not at step 107, and, in the case of YES , the data are memorized with decimal point respectively at step 108. In the case of NO , data are memorized without the decimal point even when it is included therein step 109 . After the data are memorized at one of steps 106, 108 or 109, it is decided if data entry is finished at step 110. If it is not finished, data are entered further at step 103 or 104. When the data entry operation is completed, there transferred to other operations. According to the data entry program mentioned just above, when a real number for instance 123.45 is entered, it is memorized as 00123.45 at step 108 and, at step 109, it is memorized as 0012345 . Decisions whether or not the decimal point should be the standard point upon memorizing data and whether or not the decimal point should be memorized together with other data are determined by parameters designated in the program setting mode. As is mentioned in connection with the setting manner of the detail records etc., an essential object of the function is as follows. Usually, data entry operations are made with use of ten keys and function keys in the data terminal equipment. According to the custom of the ordering service, for instance, the quantity of an article to be ordered is specified with a unit such as one dozen, one carton or the like which is usually determined depending on the property of the article and the store in which the article is dealt with. Also, there are many zeros in data with respect to the quantity in the stock management. In the case mentioned above, entry operations such as ten key 1 function key ten key 0 function key are repeated usually. In such a case as mentioned above, entry operations will be much simplified if a number of 0 or 1 is automatically input only by pushing a function key without a deposition with use of a ten key. Fig. 24 shows a flow chart therefor. As is shown in Fig. 24, when one of data entry jobs is chosen, data are entered with use of ten keys or through TPR and, then, a function key is operated usually. Instead of the usual data entry, a specified function key can be operated first without the operations of one or more ten keys. If such an entry is designated to be invalid by parameters having been set in the parameter setting mode, it is regarded as an error at step 101. If such an entry is designated to be valid, it is decided whether the entry is to be treated as the deposit of 1 or not at step 102. If decided YES , 1 is memorized at step 103. In the case of NO , 0 is memorized at step 104. Such omission of deposit is designated about every item of entry data. Therefore, it becomes possible to use the same function key as a key for omission of deposit among a variety of data entry jobs commonly. Accordingly, it becomes unnecessary to increase the number of function keys, key operations can be simplified, the entry speed can be made fast and possible entry mistakes can be avoided. Upon inputting record data such as a set of a maker code, an article code, a quantity of article, an amount of money and so on, for instance in the ordering service, there are some common data such as a maker code, an article code or the like among records. In the case that there are some common data among records, it is bothersome to enter these data at the entry operations of each record. Therefore, in the present system, it becomes possible to designate with respect to every item whether the data entry can be skipped or not according to parameters designated. If it is designated with respect to one item that the data entry can be skipped, the data of the corresponding item of the preceding record is automatically memorized as that of the present record when the skip of the data entry is made. The setting conditions about the skip is possible by designating parameters at the item 01 in Table 3 1. Fig. 25 shows a flow chart for skipping data entry. As shown in Fig. 25, when each item is input by ten keys or through TPR, it is decided at step 101, if the entry fashion corresponds to that designated about the item See items 13 and 14 in Table 2 . In the case of NO , it is decided if the skip of data entry is possible at step 102. In the case of YES , it is decided if the entry fashion corresponds to that of the next item at step 103. Namely, at this step 103, it is decided if the data entry with respect to the item next to the item to be skipped was done. In the case of NO , it is required to re enter the data. In the case of YES , the data of the corresponding item of the preceding record is read out and is set once in the buffer memory after executing the edition of the data, every check thereof and the edition of the memory at step 104. At the next step 105, the data of the item skipped having been edited is set in the buffer memory as the input data. Alternatively, if the entry fashion corresponding to that designated at step 101, there proceeded directly to step 105. When the entry about all items of one record is completed step 106 , the entry data in the buffer memory is set in the data memory as one record at step 107 and, then, the data entry for the next record is done. According to the function just mentioned above, the entry of the common data can be skipped to execute the next data entry. Therefore, the data entry operation is simplified and can be done fast and possible entry errors can be avoided. According to this function, when one of data entry jobs for the stock management, the ordering service and the stock taking service etc. is chosen, the service identification code representing the kind thereof is automatically written on the data memory. The code is written at the timing that a job key for data entry is pushed down. The code is provided for identifying the kind of data in the case that the host machine accesses data entered at the side of the data terminal equipment and process data accessed. The digit length and content of the service identification code are set in the setting mode. It is selectable whether the service identification code should be written on the data memory upon the data entry or not. In the case that it is to be written, the digit number length can be designated arbitrarily. The content thereof can be also designated arbitrarily within the digit number designated for every data entry job See Tables 19 and 20 . According to the function mentioned above, many entry data of a variety of kinds can be memorized in the data memory mixedly. If the function is not necessary, 0 is designated as the system parameter therefor. If necessary, one digit of 1 to 8 is designated. The service identification code is set by designating a code suitable for representing the content of the service briefly within the digit number designated. Fig. 26 shows a flow chart for processing the service identification code. As shown in Fig. 26, when one of data entry jobs is chosen at step 101, it is decided whether the service identification code is designated or not at step 102. In the case that it is designated, it is set in the data memory at step 103. Therefore, the service identification code is automatically assigned to the head of each data being entered in this data entry job. Then, at step 104, data regarding to the data entry job are entered sequentially and data having been entered are set by one record unit in the data memory. The data entry is continued until the completion of the data entry is confirmed at step 105. Contrary to the above, if the service identification code is not designated, the step 103 is skipped and the data entry at step 104 is executed. When the data entry job is completed, the next job, for instance the output of data to the host machine is started. The data output job is chosen at step 106, the entry data memorized in the data memory are output to the host machine at step 107. Since the service identification code is output at first as a heading data upon the data output if it is designated, the kind of service with respect to data being input can be easily identified at the side of the host machine and, therefore, the sort or arrangement of data can be done advantageously. When the data output is completed, the memory clear job is designated at step 108 and the data in the data memory are cleared at step 109. After these jobs are completed, the power is turned off at step 110. There are a variety of data entry jobs for the ordering, stock management etc. The number of items, the type of data, the entry fashion and the display format are different from each other among those jobs. Accordingly, there may be cases in which it is impossible to scroll up data displayed depending on the display format designated. Or, there may be cases in which it is better to clear the entry data when the entry is completed in order to avoid unclearness on the display. Further, the extent and or the line to be scrolled up should be varied according to the display format. The scroll up function according to the present system is improved so as to be available for an arbitrary display format by changing parameters related thereto. Fig. 27 shows an example of the display of the entry data for the ordering service in which the scroll up function is not designated and Fig. 28 shows an example of the display of the entry data for the stock management in which each data entered is scrolled up in turn. In the example shown in Fig. 27, a set of guide texts such as ORDERING SERVICE , ARTICLE CODE , A DAY OF THE WEEK , CLASSIFICATION , UNIT PRICE and QUANTITY are displayed in a fixed manner. Data are entered in the order of the article code D₁, a day of the week D₂, the classification D₃, the unit price D₄ and the quantity D₅. When the entry of these data D₁ to D₅ is once completed, all these data D₁ to D₅ are cleared up on the display. In the example shown in Fig. 28, a set of guide texts such as STOCK MANAGEMENT , ARTICLE CODE , UNIT PRICE , and QUANTITY are displayed in a fixed manner, and however, the fourth to eighth lines are reserved for displaying the entry data. Data are entered in the order of the article code Dn, unit price Dm and quantity Dl. The set of these data Dn, Dm and Dl is displayed on the lowermost line the eighth line . The set of data D This scroll up function is designated in the program setting mode and is effected in the execution mode. Fig. 29 shows a flow chart for program setting and Fig. 30 shows a flow chart far effecting the scroll up function. At first, the designation thereabout will be explained according to Fig. 29. As shown in Fig. 29, when the power is turned on, it is decided if the mode is the execution mode or not at step 101. In the case of the setting mode, one job number 4301 is designated among jobs JOB 4301 to 4307 for designating a fashion of the scroll up at step 102. As is clear from Table 13, since the item 09 is related to the scroll up function, the function key FK1 is operated at step 103 and, then, 09 is deposited with use of ten keys at step 104. When the function key FK1 is pushed again at step 105, the contents of the preceding setting are displayed at step 106. Then, numerals n₁, n₂, n₃ are deposited with use of ten keys wherein n₁ is the parameter for designating the number of lines by which the data is scrolled up, n₂ is the parameter for designating the line number which defines the upper limit of the area being able to scroll up and n₃ is the parameter for designating the line number which defines the lower limit of the area. In the example shown in Fig. 28, the parameters n₁, n₂ and n₃ are set equal to 1 , 4 and 8 respectively. In the case that the scroll up function is not needed, all of these parameters n₁, n₂ and n₃ are set equal to 0 . Then, the function key FK2 is pushed at step 108 and, at steps 109 to 111, each of parameters n₁, n₂ and n₃ is checked whether it is within the allowable extent for scroll up or not In the example shown, the maximum of each parameter is set equal to 8 . The parameter setting as mentioned above can be done about each of seven jobs from JOB 4301 to JOB 4307. In other words, the fashion or format of the scroll up is able to set with respect to each of seven data entry jobs. Next, the scroll up function in the execution mode will be explained according to Fig. 30. When one of data entry jobs is designated together with the job number thereof at step 201, data entry is done with use of ten keys at step 202 or through TPR at step 203. In the case that ten keys are used therefor, the end key is pushed down after the completion of the data entry at step 204. The data entry is continued until the completion of the data entry of all the items designated at item 06 in Table 13 is confirmed at step 205. When the data entry about one set of the items is finished, the entry data are set in the memory at step 206. Then, at step 207, parameters set at item 09 of the corresponding job number are read out and it is decided if the scroll up function is designated. In the case that it is designated, the data displayed are scrolled up in the fashion specified by parameters n₁, n₂ and n₃ at step 207. This process is repeated until the completion of all data entry is confirmed at step 208. With respect to guide texts to be displayed in a fixed manner, they are designated respectively at items 1 to 3 in Table 13. In the conventional data terminal equipment, the key for transmission is provided. The transmission of data from the data terminal equipment to the host machine is started by the operation of the transmission key. However, the provision of the transmission key is impossible in the data terminal wherein the number of keys are restricted or there is a possibility of error operations in the data terminal where the transmission key is provided. Further, steps to be taken upon the data transmission such that one connect the cable to the data terminal first and, thereafter, the transmission key should be pushed down are complicated for an unexperienced person. According to the present system, there is provided Automatic Transmission function which makes the transmission start automatically when the cable is connected to the data terminal. This function is selectable depending on whether the transmission key is provided or not. Although the function may not be necessary in the case that the transmission key is provided, it becomes necessary in the case that the transmission key is not provided. In other words, either one of the following two fashions a and b for starting the transmission is able to choose according to the type of the data terminal With respect to the job for transmission, parameters are set in the program setting mode as follows. The automatic transmission is designated by the numeral code 00 and the manual transmission is designated by one key code of 01 to 20 . The format of data output can be designated only one among the formats defined in Table 17. In the case that GP4BTS is designated in the Table 17, the transmission of data is automatically regarded as completed when all the data memorized have been output. In the case that one of data output formats other than GP4BTS is designated, the completion of the data transmission is decided only when the ending data being defined in Table 18 is received. Fig. 31 shows a flow chart for the data transmission in the execution mode. As is shown in Fig. 31, when one of data entry jobs have been completed at step 101, it is decided at step 102 whether the transmission key is provided or not. In the case that it is provided, it is decided if the key operated is the transmission key or not at step 103. When the transmission key is operated correctly, it is decided, at step 104, if the connection cable is connected correctly between the data terminal and the host machine. In the case that the transmission key is not designated, namely the automatic transmission is designated, there proceeded from step 102 to step 104 directly and judged if the connecting cable is connected correctly or not. When the correct connection of the cable is confirmed at step 104, the data transmission to the host machine is started. According to the function mentioned above, it is possible to select either the automatic transmission or the manual transmission with use of the transmission key and, in the case of the automatic transmission, the transmission key becomes unnecessary and, therefore, operations for data transmission can be simplified.
