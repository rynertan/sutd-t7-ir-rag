# MIDDLE DISTILLATE COMPOSITIONS WITH IMPROVED LOW TEMPERATURE PROPERTIES

## Abstract
The low temperature properties of a distillate petroleum fuel oil boiling in the range of 120 C to 500 C, are improved particularly the lowering of the cloud point by the addition of a polymer or copolymer of a n alkyl vinyl or fumarate ester having at least 25 wt. of n alkyl groups of average number of carbon atoms from 14 to 18 with no more than 10 wt. containing less than 14 carbon atoms and no more than 10 wt. containing more than 14 carbon atoms.
