## Description
Troy Chemical Corporation 1 TIN CONTAINING CATALYST COMPOSITIONS, THEIR USE IN CATALYSING URETHANE PREPARATION, AND METHODS OF PREPARING URETlIANES IN THE PRESENCE OF SUCH CATALYSTS This invention relates to tin containing catalyst compositions, to their use as catalysts in the preparation of urethanes, and to methods of preparing urethanes in the presence of such catalysts. The chemical reaction between compounds having isocyanate groups and those have active or lab√Øle hydrogen atoms, e.g. compounds having Old, COOH or NH groups, is well known and is used for preparing a wide variety of products and, in particular, the polymers known as urethanes. The starting materials usually have a functionality of at least two,i.e., at least two functional groups per molecule, and often more. By the appropriate selection of starting materials, and using selected formulations, many and varied urethane products, including rubbers, plastics, coatings and moulded items, may readily be made. The chemical reaction is generally catalysed, in order to increase the rate of production and or to control the quality of the finished product. Suitable catalysts include organic bases, such as tertiary.amines, e.g. triethylenediamine Dabco , and tin compounds. Suitable catalytic compounds are usually soaps, such as tin octoate or organotin compounds, such as dibutyltin dilaurate. Organic base catalysts such as the amines are generally found to be most useful for reactions where the isocyanate compound is aromatic, but are not as useful for reactions involving aliphatic isocyanates. In the latter case the tin compounds are generally required to produce adequate reaction or cure for commercial purposes. In particular, dibutyltin dilaurate is widely used for this application and is in fact recommended so often for commercial use as to be considered the standard catalyst for this use by the polymer industry. The reasons for the popularity of dibutyltin dilaurate are numerous. It is quite economica at the levels required for catalyst use. Discoloration and other side effects in the products are minimal. Its catalytic activity is very high. However, one serious disadvantage is the short pot life i.e. the time between the mixing of the total urethanQforming composition and its final use of the catalysed compositions containing it. This time is critical because, if the period is too short, as it may often be with dibutyltin dilaurate, the composition may start to cure or gel before it can be practically applied or used. Catalysis of the Isocyanate Hydroxyl Reaction , a paper presented by J.W. Britain and P.G. Gemeinhardt ofMobay Chemical Company at the Spring 1960 meeting of theAmerican Chemical Society, lists many metals as having at least some catalytic activity for producing urethanes.These metals include bismuth, lead, tin, titanium, iron, antimony, uranium, cadmium, cobalt, thorium, aluminium, mercury, zinc, nickel cerium, molybdenum, vanadium, manganese and zirconium. The results reported do not, however, include or involve the relationship beteen the so called pot life and cure time. According to a first aspect of the present invention, a catalyst composition comprises a compound of tin and a compound of another catalytically active metal which is preferably manganese, bismuth, cobalt, vanadium or iron. Other metals have been studied but may be less suitable in view of their degree of solubility in organic solvents, toxicity and or cost. According to a second aspect of the present invention, a catalyst composition of the invention is used as a catalyst in the preparation of urethanes.According to a third aspect of the present invention, in a method for preparing a urethane by reacting a compound having isocyanate groups with a compound having active hydrogen atoms in the presence of a catalyst, the catalyst is a composition of the invention. The tin compound and the compound of the other catalytically ative metal can act synergically. The weight ratio of the tin compound to the other metal compound is usually from 10 1 to 1 10, more preferably from 3 1 to 1 3 and most preferably about 1 1. The tin compound is preferably a stannous compound. It may be, for example, astannous halide such as SnCl2 although in general, any catalytically active compound may be used. Again, the compound of the other catalytically active metal may be any conventional catalytic form, for example,manganous acetate, bismuth nitrate, cobaltous chloride, vanadium sulphate or ferric chloride. The compounds will usually be made up in a conventional form, e.g. in solution. However, a composition of the invention may be provided in the form of a solution, in a solvent, in which a greater amount of the other compound dissolves than in the absence of the tin compound. This may provide a clue to the catalytic activity of the compositions of the invention, although we do not wish to be bound in any way to this theory.For example, the amount of magnesium acetate necessary to form a 5 solution in a carbitol or other solvent goes into solution reluctantly and at times incompletely. If manganese acetate is added to a 5to solution of stannous chloride in the same solvent, it goes into solution readily and completely. This produces other advantages which include greater solution stability and also the ability to produce more concentrated solutions of catalysts. In some instances, however, the addition of concentrated hydrochloric acid, for example, may be necessary to stabilize the stannous chloride solution. In general, a solution of the invention comprises at least 1 , v more preferably 200,and often at least 30t of either of both of the metal compounds. The percentages here and elsewhere in the specification may be by weight, by volume or w v, as appropriate.

One half hour later, a 3 mil film was cast onto a Leneta coated paper chart.

Its advantages are shown in set to touch time, tack free time, and colour, when compared,for instance, with manganese catalyst system c.Catalyst system a, T 12, dibutyltin dilaurate, is completely unacceptable as to pot life characteristics on an equal metal basis, and decidedly inferior even at a reduced level.

Catalysts containing manganese plus tin are superior to either tin or manganese when used alone in set to touch time, and exhibit a big advantage in pot life . The use of catalyst a, T 12, dibutyl tin dilaurate, results in markedly inferior pot life. Table Series A and B both show the synergic effect of tin when it is combined with manganese. These data also show that such synergistic combinations are superior to the known standard catalyst,dibutyltin dilaurate.

Tin when used in combination with other catalysts improve the usefulness of manganese, for example, in setto touch time, tack free time, colour and pot life compare for instance, 8 vs. 3 . Tin improves bismuth as a catalyst in tack free time and pot life compare 9 vs. 6 . Bismuth alone tends to cause silking . Tin improves cobalt in set to touch time, tackfree time, colour, and pot life compare O vs. 4 . Tin improves vanadium in set to touch time, tackfree time, colour and pot life compare 11 vs. 5 . Tin improves iron in set to touch time, tackfree time, and cdlour. There is some decrease in pot life in this instance, but iron without tin is not practical in most instances because of colour limitations compare 12 vs. 7 In all cases tin improves the performance in combination with the other metal as compared with the other metal when used alone. Thus tin almost always gives improvement in pot life, as well as produces improvement in other characteristics. The examples of Sn, 2 and T 12 1 , are included as controls. EXAMPLE 3 The tests describedin Example 2 were repeated, except that the system of Composition 2 was used. To 100 g of Composition 2 there was added the amount of catalyst solution indicated. Twenty four hours later there was added 62.3 g of Component II. One half hour later, a 3 mil film was cast on a Leneta coated paper chart. In this test, an additional observation was made, Cure Time toFailure . Failure in this test is defined when the plastic film, after aging 72 hrs., is appreciably attacked by a wad of cotton saturated with ethylene glycol ethyl ether acetate left in contact with it for a period of up to 4 hours. Observations on the effects obtained were made hourly. Cure TimeCata Set to Tack to Potlyst Amt. Touch Free Failure Life Colour o 0.5g. 22 hrs. 6 hrs. 1 hr. 24 hrs.

White The above data obtained with a different and less reactive urethane formulation show that the kind of data obtained in Example 2 was not dependent of the solvents used to dissolve the catalytic metal salts, nor is it dependent on the source or nature of the isocyanate or labile hydrogen component.Tin, p, when added to manganese, o, gives a combination, m, which shows superior setto touch time, tack free time, colour and cure, while maintaining the same pot life. T 12, a, is considerably inferior in pot life, and Dabco t, even at a very much lower level, has practically no pot life at all. EXAMPLE 4 The tests described in Example 3 were repeated using the system of Composition 3. The ratios of components are the same as those shown in Example 3.

White This Example 4, as in Example 3, shows further evidence that the improvement obtained through the addition of tin to other metals is maintained in formulation changes of the solvents used in making the catalyst solution or the urethane formulation. Efforts were made 1 by using double the normal amount of catalyst, and 2 by use of faster evaporating solvents to produce, with this somewhat less reactive system, a faster and more complete cure. T 12, a, yields an impractically short pot life. The combination of manganese and tin, when used in a mixed dimethyl sulfoxide and carbitol solvent, s, or in dimethylformamide, n, gives results superior to manganese, q, or tin, r, in setto touch time, tack free time, cure and pot life. Improvement in tack free time and cure were particularly noteworthy. The above Examples illustrate clearly the synergic effects obtained through the use 6f tin with other metals as catalysts for the urethane reaction. Among the advantages generally obtained are increased pot life, improved colour, and improved set to touch time, tackfree time, and cure. Such tin metallic catalyst combinations offer improved characteristics, particularly in pot life, to the hitherto used urethane producing catalysts such as dibutyltin dilaurate and Dabco.
