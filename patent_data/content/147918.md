# Magnetic disk accessing circuitry.

## Abstract
A disk storage system is disclosed comprising a rotat able disk, a cooperating magnetic head, positioning appar atus for positioning the head at different radial positions of the disk for reading and or writing data on the disk, a baseplate for supporting the above, and control circuitry for preventing oscillation build up in the baseplate from delete riously interfering with system performance. The control circuitry is constructed and arranged to control the timing of head positioning operations so as to inhibit the reinforce ment of baseplate oscillations.
