# Method of and apparatus for interengaging a pair of slide fastener stringers.

## Abstract
A pair of slide fastener stringers 18,19 are intermittently fed in a pair of longitudinal paths 16,17 , respectively, in parallel planes with respective rows of coupling elements 89,90 being directed in one direction. The slide fastener stringers 18,19 are laterally shifted toward each other off their paths 16,17 by coupler members 64,65 as the latter are combined together. A presser 78 is moved into coaction with the combined coupler members 64,65 to define a generally Y shaped coupling channel 86 in which the rows of coupling elements 89,90 are forced into confronting relation. The rows of coupling elements 89,90 can be interengaged when they move through the coupling channel 86 .
