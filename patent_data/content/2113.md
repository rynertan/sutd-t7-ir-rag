# Electrical connectors and the combination of a series of these connectors and a wire connecting apparatus.

## Abstract
First and second housing parts 11 and 12 are fixed together in spaced relation with a disc like contact member 14 having wire gripping slots 54 rotatably mounted between them. The slots have mouths 53 aligned with wire receiving passageways 23, 33 in the first and second housing parts. Tabs 51 on the contact member 14 are locked in recesses 44 in a third housing part 13 rotatably mounted on the first housing part 11 by cooperating ribs 42 and groove 16 and defining a cavity enclosing the second housing part 12 and contact member in a reservoir of sealant. The connector is adapted for operation by a hand tool which rotates the third housing part 13 relative to the first housing part 11 to drive wires inserted in the passageways 23, 33 into the slots.
