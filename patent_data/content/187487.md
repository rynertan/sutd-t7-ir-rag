BENZOTHIOPHENES AND BENZOFURANS HAVINGANTIALLERGIC ACTIVITY The present invention provides novel benzotbio phene and benzofuran compounds, novel methods for synthesis thereof, selected novel intermediates, pharmaceutical compositions, and uses of the novel compounds particularly as antiallergic agents.Additionally, the compounds prevent the release of mediators including histamine and leukotrienes from basophils and mast cells, and prevent respiratory burst in neutrophils providing activity useful in cardiovascular disorders as well as in antiinflammatory, psoriasis, and antimigraine treatment. These compounds act as inhibitors of cell activation. SeeB. Samuelsson, Leukotrienes Mediators of ImmediateHypersensitivity Reactions and Inflammation, Science,Vol. 220, p 568 1983 , P. J. Piper, Leukotrienes, Trends in Pharmacological Sciences, pp 75 L 77 1983 , and J. L. Romson, et al, Reduction of the Extent ofIschemic Myocardial Injury by Neutrophil Depletion in the Dog, Circulation, Vol. 67, p 1016 1983 . European Patent Application Number EP 0146243 discloses a series of benzofuran and benzothiophene compounds. However, the benzothiophenes of the present invention are not included in EP 014623 and the benzofurans of the present invention cannot be ..ade by the processes disclosed in xP 0146243. European Patent Publication Number 69,521 discloses benzothiophene derivatives. However, the novel compounds of the present invention include differences, for example, having tetrazole and carboxamide substitutents, from the compounds inEP 069,521 not suggested by its disclosure.Additionally, US Patent Number 3,452,039 discloses benzothiophene derivatives, however, the substitutents of the present compounds are not shown. Furthermore, the antiallergic utility now found for novel compounds of the present invention is not within the teachings for the benzothiophene compounds disclosed by either the EP 69,521 reference or the US Patent Number 3,452,039. The present invention is a compound of Formula I EMI3.1 wherein 1 R1, R4, and R5 are independently H, alkyl of from one to twelve carbons, inclusive, alkoxy of from one to twelve carbons, inclusive, hydroxy, aryl, R1 taken twice having each on adjacent carbons such that the two Rls together are methylenedioxy, nitro, amino, substituted amino, mercapto, alkylthio of from one to four carbons inclusive, alkylsulfinyl of from one to four carbons, inclusive, alkylsulfonyl of from one to four carbons, inclusive, arylthio, arylsulfinyl, arylsulfonyl, or halogen 2 R2 is 9, alkyl of from one to twelve carbons, inclusive, alkoxy of from one to twelve carbons inclusive, arylmethoxy, amino, substituted amino, mercapto, alkylthio of from one to four carbons, inclusive, alkylsulfinyl of from one to four carbons, inclusive, alkylsulfonyl of from one to four carbons, inclusive, arylthio, arylsulfinyl, or arylsulfonyl and 3 R3 is A or 3 with the proviso that when 23 is B then R2 cannot beH or alkyl of from one to twelve carbons, inclusive 4 X is oxygen or s o q wherein q is zero, one, or two and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Further, the present invention includes a process for the preparation of a compound of Formula I wherein R1, R4, R5, R2, and R3 are as defined above, which comprises treating a compound having theFormula III, wherein R1 and R2 are as defined above to obtain the compound of Formula I as shown inScheme I. The process of Scheme II which comprises treating the compound of Formula III or III3 wherein R6 is each the same or different and is hydrogen, alkyl of from one to six carbons, or a protecting group with the proviso that not both of R6 are hydrogen with the compound of Formula II1 in the presence of a coupling agent to obtain the compound of Formula I1, wherein R3 of Formula I is the moiety shown by A. Suitable coupling reagents for the conversion of the compounds of the Formula III or of the Formula II13 are l,l carbonylbis l H imida ole , 1,3 dicyclo hexylcarbodiimide, 1 ethoxycarbonyl 2 ethoxy 1,2 dihydroquinoline EE DC2 and the like. The N R6 2 group in III3 is subseguently treated to remove the protecting group, if necessary. A compound of Formula III is known or can readily be prepared from compounds known in the literature.For example, compounds of Formula III wherein R2 is an amino or a substituted amino may be prepared by methods analogous to those described by James R. Beck,J. Org. Chem., Vol. 37, No. 21, pp 3224 6 1972 .Beck described compounds in which X is sulfur and the substituent R2 is an amino. Substituted amino groups can be prepared from the amino compounds by standard methods. Compounds of Formula III wherein X is oxygen and R2 is amino or substituted amino may be prepared by methods shown in Scheme IV using conditions analogous to those known in the literature.Particularly, selected compounds having X as oxygen in the Formula III3, III4 and III5 of Scheme TV are found in the literature, for example, K. Gewand andB J. Jansch, J. Prakt. Chem. 315, 779 1973 , F. A. Trofimov, et al, Chem. Het. Comp., l 1129 1975 and S. a. Mahajan and Y. S. Agasimundin, J. Ind.Chem. Soc., 54, 965 1977 . Scheme IV shows the use of an acetyl protecting group. Other known protecting groups may be used as noted hereinafter. Substituents in the R1 position of the compound III not described by Beck may be obtained by other known methods. For example, for compound I where X is oxygen, R2 is alkoxy or arylmethoxy, and R3 is COOH or A preparation of precursors is shown in Scheme V.Suitable alkylation reagents for the conversion of III2 to III1 are alkyl halides, alkylsulfonates, O alkyl N,N dialkylisoureas, and the like. Particularly, compounds of the Formula 1112, III1, and III where X is oxygen are described by J. D. Brewer, et al, inAust. J. Chem., 24, 1883 1971 , by E. C. Schroeder, et al, in J. Org. Chem., 27, 586 1962 , and By K. v.Auwers, in Chem. Ber., 61, 408 1928 . Compounds of Formula III wherein R2 is a mercapto or alkyl or aryl mercapto within the present invention may be made by procedures analogous to those shown to prepare the mercapto containing compounds in the following Examples 1A E, 2A E, or 6A E, or other known methods. Likewise, compounds of Formula III wherein R2 is alkylsulfinyl and arylsulfinyl or alkysulfonyl and arylsulfonyl described herein can be prepared by known methods adapted to the preparation of such a compound from a mercapto by alkylation or arylation and then oxidation. The process which comprises treating the compound of Formula III to obtain the compound of Formula I2 wherein R3 of Formula I is the piety shown by B is one in which the compound of Formula III is treated by methods analogous to those known in the art to give a compound of Formula IV, wherein R1 and R2 are as defined above, e.g., see T. Kamijo, et al, Chem.Pharm. Bull., 32 7 12560 4 1984 , and see also for compounds of Formula IV where X is oxygen M. Pesson and . Joannic, British Patent Number 1,233,268, issued May 26, 1971, R. Bryant, and D. L. Has lam, J. Chem. Soc., 2361 1965 , and 8. S. Sangapure andY. S. Agasimundin, lend. J. Chem., 14B, 6886 1976 , and the compound of Formula IV is then treated in a manner analogous to that described by R. D. Buchanan, et al, in US Patent Number 3,452,039 cited as a reference herein before. See Scheme III. The antiallergy activity of the compounds having the Formula I of the present invention was determined by the well known Schultz Dale procedure, that is described in N. Chand, et al, Agents and Actions, 8, 171 1978 or the Herxheimer in vivo antiallergy test described in H. Herxhcimer, J. Physiol. London Vol. 117,251 1952 . By virtue of this antiallergy activity the compounds of Formula I are useful in treating an allergic hypersensitivity reaction ARR having broad symptoms. For example, the symptoms may include dermatitis, lacrimation, nasal discharge, coughing, sneezing, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, difficulty in breathing, pain, inflammation, and in severe cases, anaphylactic shock, circulatory collapse, and even death. The AER is found in man as well as other animals suffering from bronchial asthma, seasonal pollinosis e.g., hayfever , allergic rhinitis, urticaria, allergic conjunctivitis, food allergies, and anaphylactoid reactions. In an AER an antibody reagin in man influences the cell membrane of a mast cell by reacting with an antigen, to initiate reactions within the mast cell which ultimately causes release of mediators bioactive compounds such as bradykinin, slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis SRS A , histamine, serotonin 5HT , possibly some prostaglandins, or other not now known substances.The mediator is released from the mast cell whereupon it attaches to suitable receptor sites e.g., on smooth muscle resulting in ARR attack symptoms. Various methods are us.d to relieve the symptoms of AHR. It is not known, however, what mechanism i. effected for the antiallergic use by the compounds having Formula I of the present inventions. Pharmaceutical compositions are prepared from compounds of Formula I and salts thereof described as the present invention having inert pharmaceutical carriers. The compositions may be cither solid or liquid. A physician or veterinarian of ordinary skill readily determines a subject who is exhibiting AHR syvptons. Regardless of the route of administration selected, the compounds of the present invention are formulated into pharmaceutically acceptable dosage for by conventional methods known to the pharmaceutical art. The compounds can be administered in such oral unit dosage forms such as tablets, capsules, pills, powders, or granules. They also may be administerea rectally or vaginally in such forms as suppositories or bougies they may also be introduced parenterally e.g., subcutaneously, intravenously, or intramuscularly , using forms known to the pharmaceutical art.They are also introduced directly to an affected area, e.g., in the form of eye drops or by inhalation .For the treatment of AHR induced conditions such as erythema, the compounds of the present invention may also be administered topically in the form of ointments, creams, gels, or the like. In general, the preferred route of administration is orally. An effective but nontotic quantity of the compound is employed in treatment. The ordinarily skilled physician or veterinarian will readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the anti AgR agent to prevent or arrest the progress of the condition. In so proceeding, the physician or veterinarian could employ relatively low dosages at first, subsequently increasing the dose until a maximum response is obtained. Initial dosages of the compounds of the invention having Formula I e.re ordinarily in the area of 10 mg up to 2 g per day orally, preferably 10 mg to 500 mg per dose orally, given from one to four times daily or as needed. When other forms of administration are employed equivalent doses are administered. The compounds of this invention can also be administered as pharmacologically acceptable salts such as can be readily prepared with inorganic and organic bases, such as Na0H, KOR, Mg OH 2, Ca OH 2, NR4OH, substituted ammonium salts, 1, arginine, choline, N methyl glucamine and the like. The novel compounds of Formula I are named as derivatives of benzothiophenes or benzofurans by virtue of a sulfur or oxygen containing heterocyclic five membered ring fused to a phenyl ring. The fused rings are numbered counterclockwise starting with the sulfur or oxygen atom at the one position as shown in the ring system of Formula I . Certain compounds within the scope of Formula I as defined above are preferred. Among the preferred compounds of Formula I are those wherein R3 is the substituent A, i.e., carboxamidotetrazole. Also among the preferred compounds are those wherein R1 is methoxy, particularly in the five or six positions.More preferred are the following compounds 1 5 methoxy 3 1 methylethoxy N 1H tetrazol 5 yl benzo b thiophene 2 carboxamide, 2 3,5 dimethoxy N1H tetrazol 5 yl benzo b thiophene 2 carboxamide, 3 6 methoxy 3 1 methylethoxy N 1H tetrazol 5 ylbenzo b thiophene 2 carboxamide, 4 3 1 methylethoxy N 1H tetrazol 5 yl benzothiophene2 carboxamide, 5 5 methoxy 3 methylethyl thio N 1H tetrazol 5 yl benzo b thiophene 2carboxamide, and 6 6 methoxy 3 phenylmethoxy N 1H tetrazol 5 yl 2 benzofurancarboxamide. Of the above, the most preferred compounds are 1 , 3 , and 5 . Alkyl of from one to four carbons, inclusive, is methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, or isomeric forms therof Alkyl of from one to twelve carbons, inclusive is methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl octyl, nonyl, etc, and includes isomeric forms of the alkyl of from one to six carbons, inclusive. Alkyl of from one to six carbons, inclusive, are preferred. Alkoxy of from one to twelve carbons, inclusive, is methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, butoxy, etc, and includes isomeric forms of alkoxy of from one to six carbons, inclusive.

Generally, the compounds having the Formula I, wherein R1 and R2 are as defined above, and R3 is the substituent A are prepared by treating the compound of Formula III wherein R1 and R2 are as defined by one of two methods. The first method shown as Scheme I which is preferred treats the compound III with 5 aminotetrazole in the presence of a coupling agent and triethylamine. About 20 excess of the 5 aminotetrazole, the coupling agent, and the triethylamine compared to one equivalent of the compound III is preferred.Coupling agents may inc ude l,l carbonylbis lE imida zole dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, 1,3 diisopropylcarbodiimide, and the like. Solvents for the method may include one or more of tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformainide, acetonitrile, and the like, but preferably the solvent is acetonitrile. The mixture is refluxed for from about 4 to 24 hours. The second method also generally shown asScheme II is accomplished by reacting the compound ofFormula III, and 5 aminotetrazole in the presence of the coupling agent, all in equivalent amounts in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran that is preferred, diorane, dimethylformsmide, dimethylsulforide, and the like. Generally, the coupling reaction shown inScheme II includes variations known to one of skill in the art. The above compound of Formula 11 is separated and purified by conventional methods or may be used in crude form. Under certain circumstances it is necessary to protect either the N or O of intermediates in the above noted process with suitable protecting groups which are known. Introduction and removal of such suitable oxygen and nitrogen protecting groups are well known in the art of organic chemistry see for example, 1 Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, J. F. W. McOmie, ed., New York, 1973 , pp 43ff, 95ff 2 J. F. W. McOmie, Advances in Organic Chemistry, Vol. 3, 191 281 1963 3 R. A. Borssonas, Advances in Organic Chemistry, Vol. 3, 159 190 1963 and 4 J. F.

Examples of suitable oxygen protecting groups are benzyl, t butyldimethylsilyl, methyl, isopropyl, ethyl, tertiary butyl, ethoxyethyl, and the like.Protection of an N H containing moiety is necessary for some of the processes described herein for the preparation of compounds of this invention. Suitable nitrogen protecting groups are benzyl, triphenylemethyl, trialkylsilyl, trichloroethylcarb nate, trichloroethoxyearbonyl, vinyloxycarbamate, and the like. Under certain circumstances it is necessary to protect two different oxygens with dissimilar protecting groups such that one can be selectively resolved while leaving the other in place. The benzyl and t butyldimethylsilyl groups are used in this way either is removable in the presence of the other, benzyl being removed by catalytic hydrogenolysis, and t butyldimethylsilyl being removed by reaction with, for example, tetra n butylammonium fluoride. In the process described herein for the preparation of compounds of this invention the requirements for protective groups are generally well recognized by one skilled in the art of Organic chemistry, and accordingly the use of appropriate protecting groups is necessarily implied by the processes of the charts herein, although not expressly illustrated.
