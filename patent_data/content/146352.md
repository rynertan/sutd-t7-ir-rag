# A METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR BENDING A CORRUGATED SHEET

## Abstract
A method of and apparatus for bending a corrugated sheet transversely of the direction of corrugation, the corrugated sheet being of the type having a plurality of parallel ridges and troughs formed by ridge tops 17 connected to ridge bottoms 18 by intermediate side walls 19 and 20 . The apparatus comprises a first tool 11 in the form of a pressure bar formed along the length thereof with alternating projections 16A and notches 16B and a second tool 10 in the form of an elongate member 12 carrying a plurality of projections 13 , a channel 14 being provided in each projection 13 to receive the first tool 11 in use of the apparatus. In use of the apparatus, a cor rugated sheet is pressed between the first and second tools so that each projection 13 of the second tool 10 enters a re spective valley between two ridge tops 17 of the corrugated sheet and the first tool 11 enters the channels 14 of the pro jections 13 to form a fold 22 extending transversely of the corrugations and into the valleys of the corrugated sheet. The trough bottom 18 of each corrugation is brought into contact with the base of the respective notch 16B during the pressing operation and at the same time the side walls 19 and 20 of the respective valley contact the edges of the notch 16B whereby the portions 19A and 20A of the side walls between the point of contact with the notch edge and the trough bottom 18 are moved away from the valley 21 and the portions 19B and 20B of the side walls between the point of contact and the ridge top are moved into the valley.
