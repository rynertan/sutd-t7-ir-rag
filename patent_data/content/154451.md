# PHOTORESPONSIVE SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE HAVING A DOUBLE LAYER ANTI REFLECTIVE COATING

## Abstract
An improved dual layer anti reflective coating for use in a photoresponsive semiconductor device 12c is disclosed. The coating has a low parasitic absorbance in the range of about 475 to 600 nanometers. The dual layer has an incident light layer 22 and an intermediate layer 20c . The light incident layer may be a transparent conductive oxide. The intermediate layer is formed of a silicon alloy including at least one band gap energy widening element and may be the outermost layer of the device. The intermediate layer has an index of refraction between the indices of refraction of the incident light layer and the underlying photoresponsive semiconductor device. The relative thicknesses of the inci dent light layer and intermediate layer are chosen to maximise the amount of light transmitted to the photore sponsive device.
