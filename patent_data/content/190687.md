## Description
PROCESS FOR PREPARING ETHYL alpha 1 CARBOXYETHYL AMINO gamma OXO gamma PHENYLBUTYRATE The present invention relates to a process for preparing ethyl alpha 1 carboxyethyl amino gamma oxo gamma phenyl butyrate especially its optically active alpha S,1S form having the formula I EMI1.1 wherein an asterisk represents 5 configuration of asymmetric carbon atom. The compound having the formula I is a precursor of ethyl aS,lS a l carboxyethyl amino Yphenylbutyrate having the formula III EMI1.2 wherein an asterisk represents S configuration of asymmetric carbon atom, which is a very useful intermediate compound for synthesis of the various amino acid derivatives having the general formula II EMI1.3 tb SEP CH tb SEP g SEP CH2 CH2 CH NH CH COX SEP 11 tb SEP 22 SEP COOC,ECH COX SEP tb SEP 6 SEP COOC2H5 tb SEP COOH SEP COOH SEP COOH tb wherein SEP X SEP is SEP , SEP N SEP , SEP N SEP SEP or SEP the tb like and an asterisk represents S configuration of asymmetric carbon atom, said amino acid derivatives having the general formula II being expected for use as antihypertensive agents due to their angiotensin converting enzyme ACE inhibitory activity. Hitherto, it has been known that ethyl a l carboxyethyl amino Y oxo Y phenylbutyrate is prepared by subjecting ethyl B benzoylacrylate IV and S alanine benzyl ester V to the so called Michael addition reaction in the presence of triethylaine and then conducting hydrogenolysis of the product to cleave benzyl group Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 103364 1983 and Tetrahedron Letters, Vol. 25 11 , 1143, 1984 . The reaction scheme is as follows EMI2.1 aS,lS VI aR,lS CVII It is also confirmed that aS,lS diastereoisomer VI is predominantly produced when S alanine ester is employed and thus aS,lS diastereoisomer VI can be obtained by crystallization or silicagel column chromatography. However, the above method employing S alanine ester requires a procedure to convert the amino group moiety of the ester, which is present in the form of a salt with an acid used in the esterification,into free amiF op in addition to a procedure to esterify S alanine. Further, it is required to employ such an ester that the ester moiety is selectively converted into carboxylic group by hydrogenoysis without converting ethyl ester moiety of the product derived from ethyl ss benzoyiacryrate into carboxylic group. Thus the ester which can be employed in the reaction is limited to the ester such as benzyl ester or tert butyl ester, which are prepared by relatively complicated procedure.Moreover, in order to carry out a selective ester degradation, the complicated procedure such as hydrogenolysis or trifluoroacetic acid treatment is required. Consequently, it is understood that the method is not suitable for an industrial production of CaS,lS ethyl a l carboxyethyl amino Y oxo Y phenylbutyrate in view point of an operatablity and a cost for production. As the result of the present inventors continuous efforts to establish an economical, simple and efficient process for an industrial production of aS, lS ethyl a l carboxyethyl amino Y oxo Y phenylbutyrate, it was found that ethyl a l carboxyethyl amino Y oxo Y phenylbutyrate can be obtained with an extremely high yield by reacting an alkali metal salt, an alkaline earth metal salt or a quarternary ammonium salt of alanine with ethyl S benzoylacrylate, that aS,1S diasteroisomer of ethyl a l carboxyethyl amino Y oxo Y phenylbutyrate is predominantly formed over aR,lS diastereoisomer by conducting the reaction under particularly controlled reaction conditions employing a metal salt of S alanine, that aS,lS form is selectively crystallized only by adding an equivalent amount of an acid for neutralization and almost pure aS,1S form is obtained by a simple procedure with an excellently high yield, and that ethyl l carboxyethyl amino Y phenylbutyrate can be prepared by catalytically reducing ethyl a l carboxyethyl amino Y oxo Y phenylbutyrate. According to the present invention, there can be provided a process for preparing ethyl a l carboxy ethyl amino y oxo Y phenylbutyrate by reacting an alkali metal salt, an alkaline earth metal salt or a quarternary ammonium salt of alanine with ethyl B benzoylacrylate, wherein aS,lS diastereoisomer is predominantly prepared over aR,1S diastereoisomer by conducting the reaction under controlled conditions employing S alanine, and a process for preparing ethyl a l carboxyethyl amino Yphenylbutyrate by catalytically reducing ethyl a l carboxyethyl amino Y oxo Y phenylbutyrate. Starting trans ethyl B benzoylacrylate can be easily prepared, for instance, by ethyl esterification of trans B benzoylacrylic acid, which is obtained by a known method such as Friedel Crafts acylation reaction of benzene and maleic an hydroxide or dehydration condensation of glyoxalic acid and aceophenone. Cis ethyl B benzoyl acrylate can be prepared by isomerizing the trans form with irradiation of light. The alkali metal salt, alkaline earth metal salt or qurternary ammonium salt of alanine can be prepared by a simple procedure such as stirring a mixture of alanine and a stoichiometrically necessary amount of alkali metal hydroxide, alkaline earth metal hydroxide, alkali metal carbonate, quarternary ammonium hydroxide or an ion exchange resin having quarternary ammonium hydroxide as an exchange group, in a solvent of water or alcohols at room temperature or with heating. If necessary, a metal salt of alanine can be isolated by distilling away the solvent under reduced pressure. Alternatively, a metal salt or quarternary ammonium salt of alanine can be prepared in situ in the reaction system by adding alkali metal hydroxide, alkaline earth metal hydroxide, alkali metal carbonate or quarternary ammonium hydroxide to a mixture of ethyl B benzoylacrylate and alanine. Examples of quarternary ammonium employed in the reaction are, for instance, tetraalkyl ammonium such as tetramethyl ammonium, tetraethyl ammonium, tetrapropyl ammonium, tetrabutyl ammonium, tetrapentyl ammonium, tetrahexyl ammonium or tetraoctyl ammonium or benzyl trimethyl ammonium, benzyltriethyl ammonium, cetyltrimethyl ammonium, decyltrimethyl ammonium, ethyltrimethyl ammonium, octyltrimethyl ammonium, phenyltrimethyl ammonium, trimethylstearyl ammonium, B hydroxyethyl trimethyl ammonium, trioctylmethyl ammonium, tetradecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium and the like. Ammonium is also employed in the reaction. Further, an anion exchange resin having a quarternary ammonium as an exchange group can also be employed though the reaction is carried out in a solid liquid phase. Michael addition reaction of ethyl ss benzoyl acrylate and an alkali metal salt, an alkaline earth metal salt or a quarternary ammonium salt of alanine can be carried out in a vast range of solvent such as, for instance, water, alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol and butanol, chloroform, acetonitrile, n hexane, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran or mixture thereof. The reaction is usually carried out in a solvent of alcohols. Except for the reaction in a heterogeneous system, the addition reacion in a homogeneous system employing a solvent of alcohols proceeds very rapidly and is usually completed within several minutes to one hour at room temperature. Though the reaction may be carried out at a temperature ranging from 10 to 600C, it is not preferable to conduct the reaction at a higher temperature since formed ethyl a carboxyethyl amino Y oxo Y phenylbutyrate is relatively unstable to the alkali in the reaction system. This unstability of the product in the reaction system is also observed after completion of the reaction as well as during the reaction and with the passage of time a decreased content of the product and a change in a ratio of diastereoisomer are observed.However, such change of the product does not occur when the reaction system is acidified by adding not less than equivalent amount of an acid based on an employed alkali, especially mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid, to stabilize the product, which makes the subsequent operation much more easy. Produced ethyl a l carboxyethyl amino Y oxo Y phenylbutyrate can be easily isolated in a conventional manner by neutralizing the alkali with an acid and distilling away the solvent under reduced pressure, followed by crystallization. If necessary, after distilling away the solvent under reduced pressure, a residue is added with water and extracted with dichloromethane and the like at pH 3.5 to 5 to separate the product in a conventional manner. It is also possible to conduct the reduction of the product without isolation to give ethyl a l carboxyethyl amino Y phenylbutyrate, which is then isolated. Though the preferable reaction condition for selectively increasing a yield of aS,lS diasteroisomer in the Michael addition reaction of ethyl B benzylacrylate and a metal salt or a quarternary ammonium salt of S alanine varies depending on a combination of the agents employed in the reaction, it is mainly affected by the factors such as a kind of the salt of S alanine, the reaction procedure and a concentration of the agents in the reaction. Lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, barium or calcium employed as an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal. However, calcium is not suitable since it rather accelerate the production of aR,lS diasteroisomer.Though it is preferable to employ lithium salt or potassium salt of S alanine when the reaction solvent is ethanol, different kind of S alanine metal salt is employed depending on whether transform or cisform of ethyl B benzoylacrylate is employed. That is, aS,lS diasteroisomer is prepared with a higher yield by employing lithium salt of S alanine when transethyla benzoylacrylate is employed and by employing potassium salt of S alanine when cis ethyl B benzoylacrylate is employed. In this way, optimum condition varies extremely depending on a kind of isomer of employed ethyl Bbenzoylacrylate and cannot sweepingly be determined. In case of trans form of ethyl B benzoylacrylate, preferably lithium salt of S alanine is slowly added for 5 minutes to 1 hour to an equivalent amount or an excess amount of ethyl B benzoylacrylate based on lithium salt of S alanine and the reaction is preferably carried out in a relatively low concentration of 50 mM to 500 mM. On the other hand, in case of cis form of ethyl B benzoyl acrylate, potassium salt of S alanine and ethyl S benzoylacrylate are preferably mixed together at a stretch in a higher concentration.When a quarternary ammonium salt of S alanine is employed, an excess amount of ethyl g benzoylacrylate based on a quarternary ammonium salt of S alanine is preferably employed in view point of a ratio of diastereoisomer and a yield. In any case, the addition reaction is completed within 5 minutes to 1 hour after completion of the addition of the reactants. With comparison of trans fonm and ci s form of ethyl B benzoylacrylate as a whole, there is a tendency that trans from has a higher aS,lS aR,lS ratio than that of cis form. When the condition as mentioned above is employed, it is possible to give 4 to 5 of aS,1S aR,1S ratio with trans form and 2 to 3 with cis form. After completion of the addition reaction, an acid such as hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid is immediately added to the reaction system to convert the formed metal salt or quarternary ammonium salt of ethyl a l carboxyethyl amino Y oxo Y phenylbutyrate into ethyl a l carboxyethyl amino Y oxo Y phenylbutyrate or hydrochloride or sufate thereof, which is then isolated as a mixture of diasteroisomer. However, when the solvent of ethanol is used, optically almost pure S,lS ciastereo isomer is crystallized only by adding an equivalent amount of hydrochloric acid based on the alkali used and stirring the mixture while cooling the reaction mixture and thus only the desired compound can be isolated with an extremely high yield.By this procedure, complicated operation of the optical resolation indispensable to a usual syntehsis reaction is not required and consequently aS,lS ethyl a l carboxyethyl amino Y oxo Y phenyl butyrate can be prepared very efficiently. Alternatively, the reduction reaction can be carried out successively without isolation of ethyl a l carboxyethyl amino Y oxo Y pehnylbutyrate after adding not less than equivalent amount of sulfuric acid based on the alkali used in the addition reaction wherein ethanol is employed as a solvent. The catalytic reduction of ethyl a l carboxyethyl amino Y oxo Y phenylbutyrate to ethy a l carboxyethyl amino Y phenylbutyrate proceeds with good yield in the presence of a small amount of acid such as sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid or phosphoric aicd in a polar protic solvent such as, for instance, alcohol, preferably ethanol, or carboxylic acid such as acetic acid. Examples of suitable catalyst are, for instance, Raney nickel, palladium, platinum and the like. For example, when palladium carbon is employed as a catalyst, around 2 to around 70 of palladium carbon based on ethyl a l carboxyethyl amino Y oxo Yphenylbutyrate is added to the reaction system and the catalytic reduction is conducted in a solvent of alcohol such as ethanol at 0 to 500C, preferably 200 to 400C, for several hours to 30 hours to almost quantitatively produce ethyl a l carboxyethyl amino Y phenylbutyrate. Also the reaction time can be shortened by increasing the amount of the catalyst. After completion of the reaction, the catalyst is separated, the acid is neutralized with an alkali such as, for instance, sodium hydroxide and the solvent is distilled away, followed by the optical resolution such as by recrystallization to give a highly pure crystal of aR,1S or aS,lS ethyl a l carboxyethyl amino Yphenylbutyrate. When aS,lS ethyl a l carboxyethyl amino Y oxo Y phenylbutyrate is used as a startig material, aS, lS ethyl a l carboxyethyl y phenyl butyrate can be obtained. According to the process of the present invention and by controlling the conditions of the Michael addition reaction or work up thereof as mentioned above, aS,lS ethyl a l carboxyethyl amino Y oxo Y phenylbutyrate having the formula I can be prepared in an extremely high yield starting from low priced transethyl B benzoylacrylate or cis ethyl B benzoylacrytate and a metal salt or quarternary ammonium salt of S alanine. Further, accoridng to the process of the present invention, aS,lS ethyl a l carboxyethyl amino Y phenylbutyrate having the formula III , which is an important intermediate compound for preparing angiotensin converting enzyme ACE inhibitory agents, can be prepared quite simply and efficiently. The present invention is more particularly described by the following Examples and ReferenceExamples. However, it should be understood that the present invention is not limited to the Examples andReference Examples and various changes and modifications can be made without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention. In the high performance liquid chromatography HPLC analysis, sample solution was subjected to the analysis after sufficient acidification of the sample solution to be stabilized since ethyl a l carboxyethyl amino Y oxo Y phenylbutyrate is somewhat unstable under alkaline condition as previously described and aS,lS diastereoisomer tends to be converted to aR,lS diastereoisomer thermodynamically.
