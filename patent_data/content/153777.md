# RF CIRCUIT SWITCHING

## Abstract
In an RF circuit comprising an inductive element with an associated electrically operable switch which may be sub jected in use to high RF potentials, for example an inductor LM with a short circuiting switch SM thereacross in an antenna tuning unit, the inductive element LM comprises a plurality of windings W1, W2, W3 which electrically are in parallel at RF and mutually isolated at DC, and electrical power for operating the switch SM is supplied via the windings W1, W2, W3 which thus provide RF isolation between the switch SM and the source of power. Control signals for the switch SM may be supplied via an opto electronic coupler OPTO TX RX or via an additional winding.
