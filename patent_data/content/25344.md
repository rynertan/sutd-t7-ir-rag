# A fluid transport hose.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to fluid transport hoses 20 suitable for transporting oil from a tanker to a mooring buoy at sea. In order to detect the imminent rupture of a hose 20 there is provided a sensing element 24 located between the plies 22,26 , the sinsing element 24 being responsive to the electromagnetic properties of the fluid present between the plies 22,26 as a result of a failure of an inner ply 22 of the hose 20 . Alternatively, the sensing element 24 may be adapted to respond by presenting an open circuit upon failure of the inner ply 22 of the hose 20 . A fibre optic element may be advantageously employed as the sensing element 24 in this alternative. The sensing element 24 may respond by a change in the conductance, capacitance and or inductance or in its ability to carry a radio frequency signal.
