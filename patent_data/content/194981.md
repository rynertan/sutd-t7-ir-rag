# A method of manufacturing bleached chemimechanical and semichemical fibre pulp by means of a one stage impregnation process.

## Abstract
In accordance with the invention a chemimechanical pulp is produced from lignocellulosic material, for example wood chips, by subjecting the material to a process in which it is steamed, impregnated with alkali and peroxide, drained, pre heated, refined and bleached. The material is impregnated in a single stage with solu tion containing alkali and peroxide. Subsequent to passing an intermediate drainage and reaction stage, the material is pre heated to a temperature of from about 50 C, but not above 100 C. The material is then refined in one or two stages. The material can be impregnated by immersing the same in the impregnating solution for a period of up to 20 minutes at a temperature of 15 60 C, or by compressing the mate rial in a screw press and permitting the compressed mate rial to expand in the impregnating solution. The ratio of alkali to peroxide in the impregnating solu tion is balanced so as to obtain a pH greater than 12. The optimal brightness for a given peroxide charge is achieved by a balanced division of the peroxide charge between the chip impregnating stage and the bleaching stage.

## Description
The shortage of wood suitable for manufacturing pulp is becoming more and more acute, and in the future the use of short fibre pulp for paper manufacturing purposes will increase as a result of the decreasing availability of conventional, long fibre raw materials. The energy costs incurred in the manufacture of pulp are also rapidly in creasing. Thus, the problem is two fold and encompasses the need for improved methods which will facilitate a wider use of suitable varieties of wood within the in dustry, and which will satisfy the need for more economi cal and more effective refining and bleaching methods. The object of the present invention is to solve and or alleviate these problems prevailing in the pulp and paper industries. This object is achieved by a novel method of pre treating wood chips. Initially, wood pulp was produced by pressing a log against a rotating grindstone or pulpstone, to provide a finely divided fibre pulp. Due to the fact that the resul tant pulp contained all the lignin present in the log, the yield obtained with such methods was in excess of 95 . The pulp also has a high shive content and low strength values, owing to the fact that grinding greatly reduces the lengths of the fibres. In order to raise the quality of wood pulp, the so called chemical methods, sulphite, sulphate, and soda, were deve loped. These methods involve chipping the wood and treat ing the wood chips with chemicals at elevated temperatures and pressures. The lignin and also part of the carbohydra tes present are released in the ensuing digestion process, and the pulp yield is normally about 45 50 . The pulps are then bleached in various sequences with chlorine, alkali, oxygen gas, chlorine dioxide, hydrogen peroxide or hypo chlorite, in order to remove residual lignin and other pigmented impurities. The chemical pulps have extremely good strength properties and a high brightness value. These attributes, however, are obtained at the cost of low yields and the highly negative effect produced on the environment by the effluent from the bleaching department. This has led in recent years to intensive development work aimed at producing mechanical pulps in high yields, 90 , and high brightness values, and with strength properties approaching those of the chemical pulps, while at the same time retaining the opacity and bulk properties unique to the mechanical pulps. This development work has progressed in stages via Refiner Pulp RMP , Thermomechanical Pulp TMP , to the present variants of Chemimechanical Pulps CMP, CTMP . Such pulps are used today in the manufacture of fluff, tissue and paperboard qualities. The present invention relates to a novel, low energy method of producing high yield chemimechanical pulp having a final brightness value not previously achieved, and a pulp which in addition to the traditional ranges of use can also be used to produce, for example, fine paper qualities, due to the high brightness values attainable. In accordance with the invention, the starting material used may be lignocellolusic fibre material which has been chopped or disintegrated into chips, debris or coarse fibre pulp, referred to hereinafter generally as chips. The chemical treatment of the chips, impregnation, has been effected with an aqueous solution of alkali and some kind of peroxides. Impregnation is effected by immersing chips in impregnating solution or with apparatus of the screw press type, such as a Sprout Waldron plug screw feeder, or a Sunds Defibrator Prex . Other types of appa ratus may be used, however. The chips are advantageously treated with steam, steamed, prior to impregnation, although the result desired is not contingent on such steaming of the chips. It has long been known that the alkali treatment of ligno cellulosic fibre material softens the material as a result of chemical interaction. This softening of the material is beneficial, since the original geometric appearance of the fibres is retained during the refining process more readi ly than would otherwise be the case. Fibres can also be separated more completely from a softened material, there by reducing the content of undesirable fibre material, such as shives. During the process of softening the fibre material with alkali, some of the alkali charged to the process is con sumed by the reaction with acid components in the wood, such as uronic acid groups and acetyl groups present in the hemicellulose. It is known that treatment with alkali darkens the ligno cellulosic material. The extent to which the material is darkened increases with increasing temperatures and alkali content, and is extremely troublesome at temperatures abo ve 100 C. However, when the alkaline softener is combi ned with an organic or inorganic peroxide, this darkening of the material is counteracted while greatly improving, at the same time, the potential of the fibre material for increased brightness during a bleaching stage or a refin ing stage. The peroxide, in itself, also has a softening effect on the fibre material, and is thus also positive in this respect. Hydrogen peroxide has its decomposition maximum at a pH of about 11.6. If the ratio between alkali and peroxide dur ing the impregnation process is selected so that the pH approaches this value prior to, during, and immediately after the impregnation phase, the peroxide present will decompose while generating oxygen gas. Such reactions im pair impregnation, due to the fact that the bubbles of gas generated in the voids present in the fibre material ren ders penetration of the impregnating solution difficult. This generation of gas can also result in impregnating liquid which has already entered the chips being expelled therefrom. It has been found, in accordance with the invention, that these negative reactions from the aspect of impregnation can be eliminated by selecting the ratio of alkali to per oxide so that the pH of the solution differs markedly from the optimal pH for peroxide decomposition. It is not sufficient, however, simply to choose the ratio of alkali to peroxide so that the pure impregnating solu tion is stable. Since the wood contains a number of acid components, such as uronic acid groups and acetyl groups, the quantitative presence of which varies with the type of wood used, part of the alkali supplied is very quickly consumed in the ensuing neutralizing reactions. If an ex cess of alkali is introduced into the impregnating solu tion so as to hold the pH of the liquid which has penetra ted the chips above the pH for maximum decomposition, even though a certain amount of alkali has been consumed in neutralizing reactions, i.e. a pH above 12, it is possible with the aid of conventional impregnating apparatus to impregnate factory cut chips with a mixture of sodium hydroxide and peroxide. In this respect, there is normally required a weight relationship between the sodium hydroxi de and hydrogen peroxide charged to the system of 2.5. The wood material should then have a pH of 7 11, prefer ably 8 10, after the impregnating stage. As an example of the effect which the relationship between sodium hydroxide and peroxide has on the bleaching result, the bleaching result has been shown in Table I below as the amount of liquid taken up in litres per ton of bone dry chips when impregnating fresh birch chips. The time taken to effect impregnation may be varied between 2 and 60 minutes, preferably between 2 and 10 minutes, in order to achieve good penetration of impregna ing liquid into the chips. The solution of impregnating chemicals can be further sta bilized, by adding some form of silicon compound, such as water glass for example. Since, however, the presence of silicous material results in incrustation of the process apparatus, particularly on the hot surfaces of the beating apparatus, the use of such material should be avoided, since when balancing the ratio of sodium hydroxide to peroxide in the impregnating solu tion, as proposed by the present invention, such stabili zation is unnecessary. Impregnation can be effected either with or without the addition of organic complex builders, such as EDTA, DTPA, Dequest or the like. Subsequent to being impregnated, the chips are permitted to react for periods of from 0 to 60 minutes, in certain cases up to 90 minutes, preferably for periods of between 5 and 30 minutes, at temperatures of between 20 and 100 C, preferably between 60 and 90 C. The invention will now be described in more detail with reference to an exemplifying embodiment thereof and in conjunction with the accompanying drawing, the single Figure of which is a block schematic illustrating co im pregnation with alkali and peroxide. Screened fresh chips produced from birch, Betula Verru cosa, were steamed in a steaming vessel 1 of Figure with water steam at atmospheric pressure 100 C for a period of 10 minutes, and were then immediately treated with an impregnating solution in a number of different ways. In a first instance, the chips were immersed in a tank 2 con taining an impregnating solution which comprised an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide, with or without hydrogen peroxide. The temperature of the solution at the time of immersing the chips was 20 C, and should be held between 15 and 60 C. The impregnating time was 10 minu tes. In another instance, the chips were impregnated in a screw press 3. The impregnated chips were drained, step 4, for three minutes at 20 C or thereabove, and were then conveyed to the pre heater 5 of the refiner, where they were treated with heat at 80 C for 15 minutes. It is important that the temperature does not exceed 100 C when pre heating the chips. Subsequent to being pre heated, the chips were beaten in a twin disc atmospheric refiner 6, Sund Bayer 36 . The weight ratio of impregnating liquid to wood was 7.5 to 1, with the wood calculated as bone dry chips. Subsequent to being refined, the pulp had a dry solids content of 22 and had a pH of 7.4 7.8 when the sodium hydroxide charged was in excess of 4 by weight calculated on bone dry chips. The properties of the unbleached pulp, with the exception of brightness, were determined immediately after refine ment of the pulp in accordance with SCAN methods, after removing latency. The results are compiled in Table II. The brightness of the pulp was determined with the aid of a strong sheet, giving a brightness value which is some units lower than that obtained when determining brightness in accordance with SCAN methods of sheets of high grammage produced on a Büchner funnel. Parts of the pulps were also bleached with hydrogen per oxide after latency removal. The pulps were bleached on a laboratory scale with varying quantities of hydrogen per oxide and sodium hydroxide, sodium silicate and an organic complex builder, Diethylene Triamine Pentaascetic Acid DTPA in such proportions with respect to the amount of hydrogen peroxide charged as to obtain maximum brightness. The results are compiled in Table III. The laboratory bleaching processes 7 were carried out at a temperature of 60 C, for two hours at a pulp concentration of 12 . The properties of the bleached pulp were also analysed in accordance with SCAN methods, with the exception of brightness as in the aforegoing. When in accordance with the invention, peroxide is applied to the chips prior to defibrating and refining the same, two decisive advantages are obtained technically. The first of these reside in a reduction in the darkening of the material introduced when impregnating the chips with alkali, while the second resides in counter action of the darkening effect of the high refining temperature to which the chips are exposed. Both these favourable factors also contribute towards improving substantially the potential of the pulp for a further increase in brightness when sub jected to conventional bleaching with peroxide in a subse quent stage. The system according to the invention enables this to be done with moderate peroxide charges and in the absence of silicious stabilizers, which makes the process less expen sive and also eliminates the problems of incrustation, a problem created by silicates in both the pulp and the paper industries. By complementing the system according to the invention with conventional tower bleaching, it is possible by divi ding a given amount of peroxide optionally between the impregnation of chips and tower bleaching of pulp, either to reduce the total amount of peroxide to a given bright ness, or which is probably of greater interest by charging moderate quantities of peroxide, optimally distributed, to obtain a finished pulp which has a bright ness far in excess of that obtainable with the aid of pre sent day established techniques. The system according to the invention is based on an ad vanced impregnating technique which enables the use of conventional factory cut chips without requiring the chips to be reduced in size prior to being impregnated. Another valuable aspect of the system according to the invention is that the impregnating chemicals used, sodium hydroxide and peroxide, react optimally with respect to their respective purposes at temperatures beneath 100 C. Present day techniques are based on the use of chemicals whose optimal reaction temperature in this type of appli cation lies considerably above 100 C. When applying the invention, this difference in temperatu re enables energy input to be lowered during the impregna ting phase and also imparts to the chips properties such that the energy requirement during the refining stage is also low, 600 1000 kWh ton in a freeness range of 300 100 ml.
