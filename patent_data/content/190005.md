# AMBIENT SENSING DEVICES WITH ISOLATION

## Abstract
An ambient electrochemical device is described in which the sensing means 50,55 and the active electronics 40 are formed on discrete regions of the same surface of an inert substrate 30 and are interconnected by a shielded conduc tor 60,65 . The active electronics 40 are in a semiconduc tive material which is formed epitaxially on the substrate 30 , for example, sapphire A1₂O₃ to provide a monolithic structure.
