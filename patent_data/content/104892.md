# Compact fuel cell stack.

## Abstract
A compact fuel cell stack 10 in which a plurality of fuel cells 11a are arranged in a stack between end plates 12,13 . Resilient means 18 such as springs are connected between the end plates, imposing on the end plates 12,13 a force which urges the end plates 12,13 together to apply a predetermined compressive loading to the cells 11a . The springs are entirely disposed in the space between the end plates 12,13 and do not extend exteriorly above or below the end plates 12,13 , thereby reducing the overall stack 10 height and weight as compared with conventional struc tures. Force adjusting means to adjust the force imposed by the resilient means are preferably included.
