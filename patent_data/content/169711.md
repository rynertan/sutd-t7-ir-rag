# PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF 2 CHLOROBUTENES FROM 2,3 DICHLOROBUTANE

## Abstract
A catalytic process for dehydrochlorination of 2,3 dichlorobutane at about 125 400 in the presence of alumina, alumina gel, or ehromia on alumina produces a mixture of 2 chloro 1 butene and 2 chloro 2 butene, which are interme diates to 2 chloro 1,3 butadiene or chloroprene , an impor tant monomer for manufacturing certain synthetic elastom ers of great commercial interest.
