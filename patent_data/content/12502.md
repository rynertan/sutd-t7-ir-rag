# Polling method for a communications link.

## Abstract
Channel efficiency in a communications link between a controller 12 and multiple portable units 14 is increas ed by polling the active units and a set number of inactive units in a sequence where a poll consists of sending the binary coded adress of the portable unit. The stream of transmitted data bits is only interrupted by a response from the portable unit, then resumed at the end of the response or a given portion of the response. During the reception of the response, certain other types of messages can be sent out by the controller. Portable responses can be automatic responses as to status, etc., or can be data initiated by the operator of the portable unit keyboard and stored in the portable unit memory until armed by the operator, then automatically transmitted to the controller when the port able unit address is received.
