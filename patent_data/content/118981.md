# A process for the production of a smoking material from cigarette maker winnowings and apparatus therefor.

## Abstract
A process for converting cigarette tobacco winnowings into usable form for cigarette making, comprises crushing the winnowings, which have a moisture content compatible with cigarette making, effecting a first sieving operation on the resulting crushed winnowings, and effecting a second sieving operation on the smaller fraction resulting from the first sieving operation to remove particles unsuitable for direct use. Any larger fraction resulting from the first sieving operation may be subjected to cutting and thereafter a third sieving operation. Suitable apparatus for converting cigarette tobacco winnowings having a moisture content compatible with cigarette making into usable form for cigarette making, comprises crushing rollers 11, 12 to which the winnowings are fed, a sieve 18 arranged to receive the crushed winnowings from the crusher, and a second sieve 19 provided to separate the tobacco usable for cigarette making from tobacco dust. The apparatus may include a cutter 23, 24 for receiving and cutting the larger fraction of the sieved crushed winnow ings. The three operations of crushing, sieving and cutting are all advantageously performed on the tobacco at cigarette maker moisture. It is also performed at ambient pressure and temperature, thereby greatly reducing capital costs over processes requiring heating, cooling, pressuring or moisture variation.
