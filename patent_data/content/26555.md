# Sub miniature, multi pole toggle switch with linear see saw contacts.

## Abstract
A multi pole toggle switch 20 achieves sub miniature dimensions by mounting at least four see saw contacts 54, 55 , four stationary contacts 34, 36, 37, 39 and four actuating pads 62, 63 in at least two parallel, linear rows, each row on an opposite side of the path of the tip 28 of the toggle lever 25 plunger 27 within the switch housing 21 . A single actuator block 56 carries the four pads 62, 63 and pressure is applied by a single spring 31 from the plunger tip 28 to the sliding block 56 , thence to the pads 62, 63 and thence to the see saw contacts 54, 55 . A depending tongue 71 on the block 56 slides in a groove 72 in the base 22 to form a moving insulation barrier 69 between the rows 43, 44 of contacts 34 39 .
