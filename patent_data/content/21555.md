# Energy generating process and novel fuel therefor.

## Abstract
Process for generating energy in a furnace or a combustion engine which comprises burning in said furnace or said combustion engine a mixture of polycyclic, polycarboxylic acids obtained by oxidizing coal with aqueous nitric acid, separating from the resulting product an aqueous phase and a solid phase and then extracting the solid phase with a solvent to recover said mixture.
