# Production of highly rust resistant tinplate sheets for welded cans.

## Abstract
A process for improving the rust and corrosion resist ance of thinly coated tinplate is disclosed, wherein a black sheet coated with 0.02 0.2g m² of nickel prior to annealing is coated with 0.05 1.5g m² of tin, subsequently being treated with 0.3 10C dm² of chromate to provide a treatment of melting tin reflow . A layer of alloy thus formed is highly rust resistant and structurally different from any of those formed on thinly coated tinplate according to the prior art, so that highly rust resistant tinplate sheets for use in the manufacture of welded cans can be obtained.
