# Monitoring sheet length.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for monitoring the length of sheets, such as banknotes, passing a predetermined position is described. The apparatus includes two pairs of rollers 1, 2 defining respective nips 5, 6 through which a sheet passes. The passage of a sheet causes radial movement of portions 11 of the rollers 2 which is detected by detectors 12 mounted in a shaft 4. The passage of a sheet causes respective counters 15, 16 to be incremented at a relatively fast sheet. The method comprises 1 monitoring a relatively fast rate count at least in two pairs of intervals wherein a during one interval of each pair leading and trailing edges of the sheet are sensed respectively, the count being monitored for a period during the interval related to the time at which the leading or trailing edge passes the predetermined position, and during the other interval of each pair the count is monitored for the entire interval, b during each interval the count is incremented at a constant rate, and c the duration of the intervals is long compared with the time between successive counts 2 determining respective total counts from the moni tored counts 3 determining first and second values related to the lengths of the portions of the sheet passing the predetermined position during the intervals in which the leading and trailing edges are sensed by comparing the total counts monitored in the intervals of each pair 4 determining a third value related to the length of the portion of the sheet passing the predetermined position between the intervals in which the leading and trailing edges are sensed and 5 deriving a value related to the total length of the sheet passing the predetermined position from the first, second, and third values.
