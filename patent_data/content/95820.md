# Mounting frame for an additional window.

## Abstract
Cleaning the cavity between a window and an addition al window can be done without damaging the clamping pro files 2 of the mounting frame for the additional window 3 by shifting those clamping profiles 2 during mounting and dismounting of the additional window 3 in a plane parallel to the surface of the additional window 3 . Most preferred is a pair of profiles 1, 2 comprising a tube 4 having a square cross section with on one of its corner points 5 a flange 6 carrying at its end a click wing 7 extending parallel to the surface of the additional window 3 to be mounted.

## Description
MOUNTING FRAME FOR AN ADDITIONAL WINDOW The present invention relates to a mounting frame for an additional window, comprising pairs of a clear profile adapted to be fastened upon or within the clear, and a clamping profile engaging the clear profile. Such pairs of profiles are known in many embodiments. The clear profiles are sized and fastened to the sash upon or within the clear. Thereafter the size of the additional window, which is mostly made of PERSPEX, is determined and said additional window is fastened by means of clamping profiles also sized, which should be pushed in the clear profiles.Sometimes also click joints are used. Said additional windows serve to save fuel expenses. However, since there is no real sealing the space between the usual window and the additional window, called cavity, should be cleaned from time to time.Therefor the clamping profiles should be removed from the clear profiles again, and that mostly results in damages, since this is almost impossible without a screw driver. Another disadvantage of known pairs of profiles is that the clear profiles cannot be mounted upon the sash in different positions. The present invention intends to improve the foregoing. According to the invention this is achieved in that the clear profile comprises a recess at least defined by a click wing, on the inner side on said click wing a click edge being provided, in that the clamping profile comprises a U shaped body with from the base a push wing, the free end of which is adapted to load the additional window, and in that the inner surface of the U shaped body is provided with a click edge adapted to cooperate with the click wing. So there is question of lateral clicking, so that the clamping profiles can be easily mounted and can be dismounted too without a toolqlike a screw driver. As to the push wing there are two alternatives. Viz., the push wing may. be connected to the corner point of the base of theU shaped body which is spaced from the additional window, or to the corner point thereof which is nearby the additional window. In order to further facilitate the dismounting and mounting of the additional window, ribs may be provided on the surface of the clamping profile which is spaced from the additional window. In order to improve the centring of the additional window, or to have to use less perspex therefor, respectively, it is preferred that a centring edge is provided on the surface of the clear profile opposite to the click wing. In practice it is most preferred to use a pair of profiles which, moreover, meets the condition that the clear profile has a tube of hollow square cross section, having on one of the corner points a flange, on its end carrying the click wing, which, therefore, extends parallelly to the surface of the additional window to be mounted. In case a double or multi laminated additional window is desired, the clear profile comprises a tube of substantially rectangular cross section with on one of the corner points a flange, on its end carrying the click wing, and the diametrically opposite corner point is combined then with a clamping profile.Therewith the diametrically opposite corner point may be bevelled, so that the push wing is hidden from view in the cavity as much as possible. The pairs of profiles are preferably extruded from polyvinylchloride. The click edges and ribs may have a semi circular or triangular cross section. The invention will be further elucidated herebelow from the drawing, in which by way of example some embodiments of a pair of profiles according to the invention are represented. In the drawing figure 1 shows on an enlarged scale a cross section of a clear profile and a clamping profile, figure 2 shows the same as figure 1, however, of an other embodiment, and figure 3 shows on an enlarged scale a cross section of a clear profile which is used for a laminated or multiple additional window. The pair of profiles represented in figures 1 and 2 comprises a clear profile 1, a clamping profile 2 and a PERSPEX additional window 3. The clear profile 1 of figure 1 extruded from hard polyvinylchloride, comprises a square case 4 having an outside dimension of about 17 mm. In one of the corner points 5 a flange 6 is connected, said flange being in line with one of the walls of the case. Said flange effects a connection with a click wing 7 which, in the drawing, is perpendicular to the flange 6. In principle, however, the click wing may be at an other angle with respect to said flange. On the inner surface of the click wing 7 a click edge 8 is provided, which can engage a click edge 9 on the inner surface of a U shaped body of the clamping profile 2. Furthermore the clamping profile 2 comprises a push wing 10 which in figure 1 is connected to the corner point of the base 11 of the U shaped body which is spaced from the additional window 3, and in figure 2 to the corner point which is nearby the additional window. The clamping profile 2 further comprises one or more inner ribs 12 which serve to reduce the slipping resistance during mounting and dismounting of the clamping profile, and outer ribs 13 to facilitate the grip during mounting and dismounting. The ribs 12 and 13 are represented here with a semi circular cross section, however, they may have, as shown in figure 3, a triangular cross section too. The clear profile 1 further comprises on the surface opposite to the click wing 10 a centring edge 14 and the parts which should be brought into cooperation with a not shown sash are provided with shoulders 15 between which grooves are created for incorporating adhering strips with which the clear profiles can be stuck to a sash. It is also possible, however, to fasten the clear profiles with small screws. In case the pair of profiles represented in figure 1 is extruded from hard polyvinylchloride, the clear profile has a specific weight of about 13.5 kg 100 m and the clamping profile about 4 kg 100 m. Furthermore, the embodiment of figure 2 is different from the one of figure 1 in that there is no square case design. With a truncated clear profile generally only a less deep cavity can be made between the usual window and the additional window, anyhow in case said clear profile is mounted upon the sash. In figure 3 the clear profile 1 has a substantially rectangular case 16, the dimension of which parallel to the additional window to be mounted is larger than the dimension perpendicular thereto. In corner point 5 the flange 6 is connected in the same way as in figures 1 and 2, whereby a connection with the click wing 7 is effected. The click edge 8 thereof is shown now with a triangular cross section instead of a semi circular cross section an alternative embodiment which could also be applied in figures 1 and 2 for click edge 9 and ribs 12 and 13. The particularity of the clear profile of figure 3 is that the corner point 17 positioned diametrically opposite to corner point 5 is combined with means of the clamping profile of figure 2. The base 11 is positioned somewhat rearwardly with respect to the case wall to hide the push wing 10 from view as much as possible. A new part is the stop 18 and said stop is intended to cooperate with the end of the click wing 17.
