# HYDRAULIC DRIVE SYSTEM FOR A VEHICLE

## Abstract
A hydraulic drive system for a vehicle includes a hydraulic pump capable of utilizing hydraulic fluid from a reservoir. The outlet of the pump includes a pressure control valve for establishing a predetermined pressure for the hydraulic fluid being supplied to a common supply manifold for a pair of positive displacement hydraulic motors. Each of the motors has an output shah operably coupled to a wheel of the vehicle. A common discharge manifold for the motors allows hydraulic fluid to be returned to the reservoir. Each motor has an output shaft speed proportional to the flow rate of the hydraulic fluid therethrough and the flow rate is limited to a predetermined maximum level at the predeter mined pressure due to internal resistance of the hydraulic fluid flowing through the motor. The hydraulic pump is capable of supplying hydraulic fluid at the predetermined pressure at a supply rate substantially greater than the predetermined maximum level of the flow rate for one of the motors.
