## Description
PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF ELASTOMERIC POLYURETHANE MOLDINGS AND THE PRODUCT OF THIS PROCESS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION It is generally known that moldings having a compact surface can be produced from polyurethane foams by in mold foaming, by introducing into a mold, a reactive and foamable mixture based on compounds containing several reactive hydrogen atoms and polyisocyanates. Water and or fluoro chlorinated hydrocarbons may be used as blowing agents. Catalysts of the type commonly used in the production of polyurethane foams are also generally used. Heavy stressed moldings can be produced from linear or slightly branched starting materials which give materials having a range of properties resembling that of elastomers.Moldings of this kind are used, for example, in the automobile industry. The starting materials are preferably processed by the so called reaction injection molding technique RIM technique . This is a filling process, in which the highly active, liquid starting components are quickly introduced into the mold through high output, high pressure metering units after admixture in positively controlled mixing heads.Moldings weighing 6 to 10 kg are produced in 2 to 4 minutes, depending on wall thickness. Mixtures of substantially linear polyhydroxyl compounds of high molecular weight, a chain extender, and blowing agents are normally reacted with diisocyanates of polyisocyanates to produce moldings of this kind. Ultimate properties of the molded part are important, e.g. density, tensile strength, elongation, sag and flexural modulus. As important as the physical properties of the final molding is the processability of the formulation in the mold. It is essential to eliminate or minimize entrapment of air bubbles within the mold and reacting mixture, increase resistance to delimination, ensure an even filling of the mold cavity, minimize the cycle time, prevent porosity, and increase the tear resistance or green strength at demold. Any system is plaqued by any or all of these problems in varying degrees.One goal is to lengthen the cream time of the mixed components in order to allow the mixture to smoothly and evenly flow into all the crevices of the mold prior to foaming, while at the same time trying to minimize the gel and rise times of the foam so that the demolding of the finished part can be completed as soon as possible. Another goal is to maximize green strength or the integrity of a freshly demolded part. This property is qualitatively measured by immediately bending a corner of the demolded part over itself and observing tearing, crazing, hairline cracking and breaking. While this property may in some cases be enhanced by increasing the mold temperature, energy conservation demands and negative effects on the stiffness of the molded part require a relatively low temperature.Similarly, while this property may in some cases be enhanced by increasing residence time of the part in the mold, economical cycle times require a relatively short demold time. In conventional formulations, the system is chain extended with a low molecular weight diol, in particular 1,4 butane diol or ethylene glycol. It has recently been found that a particularly good extender comprises a mixture ethylene glycol and another low molecular weight polyol. In addition, conventional catalysts forRIM systems include the typical amine tin combination which are used in many polyurethane applications e.g.a mixture of triethylene diamine DABCO and dibutyl tin dilaurate. Many other tin catalysts including delayed action catalysts are known and are available including those which are the subject of the present invention. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION It has now been unexpectedly found that a particular set of tin catalysts, when used in making RIM elastomeric moldings from ethylene glycol chain extended formulations, gives significant improvements in processability of the reaction mixture and enables the making of molded parts with improved green strength. The particular catalyst in an ethylene glycol extended system is apparently the only catalyst among those known tin and delayed action tin catalysts which gives the combination of very good green strength and at the same time sufficiently long cream times to enable the filling of the mold before foaming begins and at the same time minimizes the gel and rise times for a short cycle or demold time. Accordingly, the present invention relates to a process for the production of elastomeric polyurethane moldings by the RIM process from a foamable reaction mixture comprising a organic polyisocyanates, b polyhydroxyl compounds having molecular weights in the range from about 1800 to about 10,000, c a chain extender, d a catalyst e a blowing agent and, f optionally the auxiliaries and additives commonly used in polyurethane chemistry, where the chain extender c comprises at least 75 by weight based on the total amount of chain extender of ethylene glycol and where the catalyst d used comprises a dialkyl tin dithiocarboxylate, preferablyEMI4.1 where R is a C4 C18 preferably C8 to C10 and most preferably a C8 octyl group and R represents a C1 C18 alkyl group.It is preferred that a tertiary amine be used in conjuction with the dioctyl tin dithiocarboxylate as catalyst. It is also preferred that a mixture of ethylene glycol with at least one other low molecular weight polyol 1800MW be used as the chain extender. This particular RIM formulation gives rise to long a cream time which allows for improved flow of the reacting system into the mold, but relatively short time which allows for quick demold. The formulation also gives rise to parts with improved green strength. Moreover, this improvement is not accompanied by any adverse effects on physical properties. Furthermore, these improvements are quite unexpected on the basis of the reaction rate profile for the system and the catalyst structure. Also, the improvements are not seen in catalysts which are structurally similar e.g. dimethyl tin dithiocarboxylates or dioctyl tin di mercaptides or in non ethylene glycol extended systems such as those using 1,4 butane diol. Starting components a suitable for use in the invention include aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, araliphatic aromatic and heterocyclic polyisocyanates of the type described, for example, by W.

Further examples of suitable catalysts and details on the way in which the catalysts work can be found inKunststoff Handbuch Vol. VII, published by Vieweg andHochtlen, Carl Hanser Verlag, Munich 1966 pages 96 102. The total amount of catalyst is generally used in quantities of from about 0.001 to 10 by weight, based on the quantity of compounds b . Surface active additives emulsifiers and foam stabilizers can also be used. Examples of emulsifiers are the sodium salts of castor oil sulphonates or even of fatty acids or salts of fatty acids with amines such as diethylamine oleate or diethanolamine stearate.Alkali or ammonium salts of sulphonic acids, such as those of dodecylbenzene sulphonic acid or dinaphthylmethane disulphonic acid or even of fatty acids, such as ricinoleic acid, or of polymeric fatty acids, can also be used as surface active additives. Suitable foam stabilizers include water soluble polyether siloxanes. These compounds are generally of such structure that a copolymer of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide is attached to a polydimethylsiloxane radical. Foam stabilizers of this kind are described, for example, in U.S. Patent 2,764,565. It is also possible to use reaction retarders, for example, substances with an acid reaction such as hydrochloric acid or organic acid halides. Cell regulators known per se such as paratLins or fatty alcohols or dimethyl polysiloxanes may also be used.

Stabilizers against the effects of ageing and weather, plasticizers and substances with fungistatic and bacteriostatic effects, fillers such as barium sulphate, kieselfuhr, carbon black or prepared chalk may also be used. Further examples of the surface active additives and foam stabilizers and of cell regulators, reaction retarders, stabilizers, flameproofing agents, plasticizers, dyes, fillers, substances with fungistatic and bacteriostatic effects and also details on the way in which these additives are used and how they work, can be found inKunststoff Handbuch, Vol. VII, published by Vieweg and Hochtlen, Carl Hanser Verlag, Munich 1966 , pages 103 113. The polyisocyanate component a is preferably used in such a quantity that the foamable mixture has an isocyanate value of from about 90 to about 120, more especially from about 95 to about 110. The isocyanate value is the quotient of the number of isocyanate groups and the number of isocyanate reactive groups multiplied by 100. The process of the invention is preferably carried out by the known reaction injection molding technique RIM technique . The foamable mixture is preferably introduced into the mold in such a quantity that the molding has a density of from 0.8 to 1.1 g cc. Conventional external and or internal mold release agents of the type described, for example, in GermanOffenlegungsschriften 1,953,637 and 2,121,670, may also be used. The moldings obtainable by the process of the invention are particularly suitable for the production of flexible automobile fenders and bodywork components. EXAMPLES The starting materials mentioned in the following examples are processed by means of so called high pressure dosing units the components are delivered by special pumps e.g. Bosch piston pumps, yielding high pressure of about 100 300 atmospheres to the mix head spring loaded nozzle mix head or hydraulically forced mix head , where they are thoroughly mixed by countercurrent injection HK machines from Hennecke or equivalent types of machines from other manufacturers such as KRAUSSMAFFEI, SIEMAG, CANNON . For the mechanical tes, plates measuring 120x20x0.4 cm are made up in a temperable metal plate mold made of aluminum Constructal 20 52 or nickel plated steel to ensure good surface qualities of the moldings.The mold is filled from the longitudinal side through a bar gate. A wax type release agent, giving rather dry and mat surfaces of the moldings was used for the mold release e.g. RIM 7 from Chemtrend Corp. . Generally, however, other release agents based on waxes, silicones or metallic stearates may also be used for the purposes of the invention. The invention is by no means confined to the above mentioned machines, and may be carried out equally effectively with stirrer equipped machines or friction mixing machines.

The isocyanate 92 g was then added quickly, and stirring was continued for an additional 7 seconds. The container was set down and observed for signs of reactivity.A cream time of 20.1 seconds and a rise time of 26.7 seconds were observed. When this mixture was tried on a machine, the long cream time allowed smooth filling of the mold with no entrapment of air. Further, the short rise time allowed the molded part to be demolded in less than the normal time, because of the material s fast cure. Green strength of a freshly demolded part was excellent.
