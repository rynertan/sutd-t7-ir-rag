## Description
SPECIFICATIONA Meter PanelTECHNICAL FIELD The present invention concerns a meter panel, a panel incorporating a plurality of meters arranged adjacent to one another for the concurrent display of the measured value of different measureables. In particular, although not exclusively, the invention is directed to the construction of vehicle dashboard panels, aircraft instrument panels, system monitor panels and the like.BACKGROUND ARTA typical vehicle dashboard panel incorporates a speedometer, a tachometer and various other meters for indicating the state of battery charge, petrol level, oil pressure, water temperature, etc. Each meter is of individual construction and is driven either by direct mechanical coupling to the engine transmission, or electro mechanically in response to sender unit signals. It is a disadvantage in panels of this type that as each meter incorporates a number of moving parts, these are subject to wear, and meter response is often slow due to the mechanical inertia of these parts and the response may also exhibit overshoot. The meter movements may also be expensive and difficult to make both sensitive and robust. Recently, consideration has been given to the replacement of mechanical meters by electro optic display meters eg by vacuum fluorescent devices, electro luminescent devices, liauid crystal devices and the like. Since each meter of this type can be constructed in flat panel form, it would clearly be an advantage if each meter were incorporated in a single integral panel construction.Each meter, however, will include many electrodes recniiring electrical address, but the number of connections to the panel would be limited by requirement for high reliability and yield. The problem is to meet these requirements.There is described in UK Patent Application GB2044975A a single meter display panel of non mechanical construction. This panel, as described, displays the value of a measurable by the position of one, two or three selected indices. The panel includes two sets of electrodes, one either side of an electrically sensitive medium eg a liquid crystal layer, the electrodes of one set configured and overlapping electrodes of the facing set to define a number of selectable index positions. Index indication of measured value is given when suitable address is applied to the electrodes, the one, two or three regions of the medium corresponding to selected index position being driven into an OFF state to contrast with all other regions of the medium which are driven in an alternative ON state.Pseudo random sequence binary code signals are described as the preferred form of address IXISCLOSIJEE OF THE INlT ION The invention is intended to provide 2 robust flat panel display incorporating two or more non mechical meters, the panel including but a relatively small number of input connections for the purpose of applying address to the meters. In accordance with the invention there is provided an analogue display panel formed of two support plates, one each side of an electrically responsive medium, this medium being capable of being driven upon appropriate electrical address between two different optical states co existent in different regions thereof each plate bearing electrodes adjacent to the medium with facing electrodes overlapping to define a plurality of individual meter display areas wherein on one plate the electrodes of the adjacent display areas are coextensive thus enabling a common fixed address of several signals to be applied to each meter.There is also provided an analogue display assembly comprising the combination of the panel above and drive electronic circuitry as follows A signals source for providing a set of differing cyclic drive signals, connected to the electrodes on the one plate to apply a number of the signals thereto, a different signal to each electrode a first selector, responsive to input data, connected to the signals source to select the signals to be applied to the electrodes on the other plate, in particular to select for each meter display, one of the number of signals and a second selector, responsive to input data, connected to the signals source, the first selector, and the electrodes on this other plate, to select for each meter display one of these electrodes and to apply to this one electrode the signal selected therefor, and to apply to the remaining electrodes of each meter display a signal different to the other signals, to drive the medium OFF at selected positions and ON elsewhere. When input data is applied to the operating assembly, an index character appears at a selected position on each meter. These positions are defined by the overlap of selected electrodes and facing electrodes to which like signals are applied. The regions of the medium between these electrodes are maintained in one optical state, the OFF state. Since different signals are applied to all other facing electrodes, the regions of the medium between these are maintained in another optical state, the ON state.The display panel may be in the form of a liquid crystal cell wherein the medium is of liquid crystal material. This form of panel may include one or more polarisers and may be adapted as a twisted nematic Schadt Helfrich cell in which a thin layer of nematic liquid crystal material is contained between transparent electrode bearing glass plates, the latter being treated by unidirectional rubbing and assembled with the directions of rubbing orthogonal or twisted to give a twisted alignment of the liquid crystal molecules of the layer. However, the electrode bearing plates may be treated in other known manners such as by oblique evaporation of dielectric material eg SiO or MgF2 to facilitate alignment.Small amounts of cholesteric material typically 1 may be added to the nematic liquid crystal material to prevent display non uniformity. For further discussion of this see UK Patent Serial Numbers 1,472,247 and 1,478,592 and also small amounts of dichroic dye may be added to give a coloured display and allow one or both polarisers to be omitted, as known in the art. The twist angle in such a cell may be zero. Alternatively this form of panel may be adapted as a cholesteric to nematic phase change cell including a thin layer of cholesteric material which is characterised by two phase states one, OFF state wherein the material in the focal conic texture has the property of scattering incident light the other, the ON state, wherein the material molecules are aligned by the electric field into the nematic phase and enable the transmission of incident light through the layer. A small amount of dichroic dye may be added to the liquid crystal material to enhance contrast and viewability. In this case the OFF state may alternatively be the non scattering planar texture of the cholesteric.The display panel may be an AC electro luminescent display panel wherein the medium is in the form of a solid layer of electro lumines cent material. Alternatively the display panel may be a AC plasma discharge panel wherein the medium is a suitable gas.The different cyclic drive signals may be alternating signals1 or alternatively these signals may be uni polar,that is cyclic signals having a DC component, provided the difference voltage of any two signals is an alternating voltage.Preferably the cyclic drive signals are isogonal, and may be orthogonaLA set of isogonal signals Vj, j 1, .., N has the following properties i each repetitive signal has a period T, or a sub multiple of T for its repetition ii the voltage difference between any two signals is truly alternating in the period T, fCVi vj dT O The period T being of sufficiently short duration that the medium response to the RMS value of the voltage difference in each case, and irreversible electro chemical decomposition effects are avoided iii the RMS voltage difference between any two signals is constant and not less than a minimum voltage V MIN Cvi vj R V MIN, it j i,j 1,2 ... N. This minimum voltage being significantly greater than threshold Vt ie V MIN 1.5Vt . To facilitate use of the display over an extended range of temperature, it is preferable that the finite RSE voltage difference in each case is somewhat greater than the saturation voltage V SAT at the mean operative temperature,V MIN 1.1 V SAT The saturation voltage of the panel is that voltage difference applied across the medium that is required to change the relevant optical property eg optical transmission of the corresponding region by 90 of the full property change possible .Conveniently, the set of signals may be a set of psuedo random binary sequence signals, each of period T and divided into a plurality of L bits L X N with each bit having a value logic O or 1 , corresponding to two different levels of voltage. Alternatively the signals may be a set of suitable Walsh function signals.BRIEF INTRODUtCTION OF THE DRAWINGSIn the drawings accompanying this specification Figure 1 is a cross section view of a liquid crystal display panel Figures 2 and 3 show, part in plan view anti part in schematic, the electrode configurations of the front and back plates of the panel shown in the preceding figure Figure 4 is a circuit diagram showing the drive electronic circuitry used to address one of the meters of this panel.DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED CONSTRUCTIONAn embodiment of the invention will now be described, by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawings. The meter panel shown in illustrative cross section in Figure 1 is in the form of a lecithin aligned dyed phase change display cell 1.incorporating a layer 3 of liquid crystal material. This material is of D82 E61 blue dye nematic liquid crystal to which has been added approximately 3.9 by weight of CB15 cholesteric liquid crystal. The blue anthraquinone dichroic dye D82 is given by the structural formula EMI7.1 The dye 4X5 diam mo 2X7 di isobutyl 8 dibydroxy anthraquinone described in UK Patent Application N GB 2,081,736 A. 5he liquid crystal materials E61, CB15, the dye D82 and the dyed nematic material D82 E61 are listed in the trade catalogues of BDE LtdPoole, Dorset, England. The liquid crystal layer 3 is enclosed between two glass support plates 5 and 7 and is approximately 9 microns thick to give an acceptable threshold voltage characteristic of about 5 volts. The plates 5 and 7 are each 4 mm thick and have been coated with 3011 Cl indium tin oxide, and etched to give the required electrode configurations, individual electrodes being separated by small gaps about 50 micron wide, to provide adequate isolation from each other. The configurations of these electrodes, the front electrodes 9 and the back electrodes 11, are shown in Figures 2 and 3 respectively. The back plate 7 of the panel is backed by a white card reflector 13. This reflector 13 has been tinted slightly yellow to give a neutral gray colour appearance in the display background. The front plate electrodes 9 shown in Figure 2 are configured to define six different meter display areas 15A 25S for speedometer 15A tachometer 17A battery meter 19A oil 21A, temperature 23A, and fuel gauge 25A, meter display. In addition, the front plate electrodes 9 are also configured to define on off indication display areas for brake 27A, ignition 29A, beam 31A and choke warning 33A, as also left right traffic signal indication 35A, 37A. The front plate speedometer display area 15A is sub divided into eight electrodes, and the tachometer display area 17A likewise. These electrodes are arranged in meander configuration to define open sector shaped areas 15A and 17A.A total of twenty six isolated electrodes are thus provided on the front plate 9 to define all the meter and indicator display areas of the panel.The back plate electrodes 11 shorn in Figure 3 are likewise configured to define corresponding, complementary, meter areas 153 253, 273 corresponding to 27A, 29A , 31B corresponding to 31A, 33A , 35B and 37B. The electrodes are configured, so that as assembled, complementary meter areas 15A and 15B 17A and 17B etc, will lie in register, facing electrodes overlapping to define the individual meter and indicator displays. The back plate speedometer display area 15B is divided into fifteen isolated segments A1 A15 arranged in an open sector. The tachometer display area 17B is likewise divided into segments but thirteen in number, namely the segments B 13. Each of the remaining four meter display areas 19B 25B is divided into fifteen segments C1 C15, D1 D15 E1 E15 and F1 F15. Interconnective conductive material provides connection between the thirteen tachometer segments 31 313 and thirteen of the speedometer segments Al Al 3. Likewise conductive material provides connection between the battery charge gauge segments C1 C13, C14 and C15 and the tachometer electrode segments B1 B13 and remaining speedometer electrode segments A14 and A15. The back plate electrodes of the four gauge meters 19B 25B are connected in series by connective conductive material C1 D15 E1 F15 C2,D14,E2, F14 ... C15,D1,E15,F1. One of the fifteen common back plate electrodes, the electrode M5 C15 1 El5 Fl, extends towards and connects the back plate electrodes 27B, 313, 353 and 37B of the indicator displays.Thus a total of fifteen input connections only is required to connect the back plate electrodes to the panel address, making the total number of panel input connections forty one. This number may be compared to the number of connections that would ordinarily be required, thus for a meter panel having a common back plate electrode and individual electrodes on the front plate, the number of contacts required would be 1 120 100 15 15 15 15 6 287 in all.Alternatively, a meter panel similar to that described above but where the meter to meter interconnections are omitted, each meter being addressed individually by psuedo random binary sequence coded signals, the number of connections is eighty nine. Thus as can be seen by this comparison, the number of connections for the example described is significantly smaller.The meter panel is connected to address circuitry for operation. A different coded signal is applied to each one of the fifteen back plate electrodes. For each meter one of these signals is selected and applied to a selected one of the corresponding front plate electrodes. Thus for each meter the same signal is applied to one of the back plate electrodes and to the selected front plate electrode with the result that a null RMS electric field is developed and the region of liquid crystal material between these electrodes is driven into and held in the OFF optical state. A sixteenth signal is applied to all remaining front plate electrodes and the remaining regions of the liquid crystal material that lie between the front and back plate electrodes are held in the QNn optical state.Thus, at each meter, an index is displayed against a contrasting background.The speedometer, as described, is defined by the overlap of eight front plate electrodes 17A and fifteen back plate electrodes 17B and thus provides 8 x 15 w 120 selectable index positions. A masking scale not shown is placed over the front support plate 5 and is calibrated so that the vehicle speed in the range 0 120 mph can be read with an accuracy of up to 1 mph. The tachometer 19 4 193 has one hundred anti four selectable index positions. A rev count in the range 0 10,000 rpm may thus be read up to 100 rpm accuracy.As shown in Figure 4 the twenty six coded address signals required are generated by a clocked sixteen bit static shift register 101.These signals are provided at the sixteen outputs S1 S16 of the register and fifteen of these signals are applied to the fifteen back plate electrodes A1 A15. Feedback from the first and fourth register outputs S1 and St is provided via an exclusive OR gate 103 to give psuedo random coding. To enable start up operation, a NOR gate 105 is connected to the first four register outputs S1 S4 and both gates 103 and 105 are connected to the input of the register 101 via an OR gate 107.Signal selection for the speedometer 17A 173 is provided by a 16 1 multiplexer 109. The signal inputs of this multiplexer 109 are each connected to an output of the register 101. One of the signals is selected according to the control address applied to the four control inputs al a4 of the multiplexer 109, this control address being provided from four binary data outputs D4 1 7 of an engine speed sender unit not shown .Electrode selection for the speedometer 17 4 172 is provided by a 16 1 decoder demultiplexer Ill and a bank of eight 2 1 multiplexers 113 127. The demultiplexer 151 has four control inputs a1 a4 and these are connected to three other binary data outputs D1 D3 and to the fourth data output D4 of the sender unit. The demultiplexer 171 has sixteen outputs QO Q15. Since the eight front plate electrodes 17A of the speedometer are arranged in meander configuration, they overlap adjacent back plate electrode segments Al A2, A2 A3, etc in alternating order.To allow for this, the sixteen outputs Q0 Q15 of the demultiplexer are connected in mirror pairs Q0 Q15, Q1 Q14 etc.The paired outputs are then connected to the control input C of a corresponding one of the 2 1 multiplexers 113 127. Each 2 1 multiplexer 113 127 has two signal inputs, one of which is in each case connected to the sixteenth output S16 of the register 101. The output of each 2 1 multiplexer 113 127 is connected to a corresponding one of the speedometer front plate electrodes 17A. In response to input data from the sender unit and under the control of the demultiplexer 111, the signal selected by the 16 1 multiplexer 109 is channelled to the output of one only of the 2 1 multiplexers 113 1 27. The signal from the sixteenth output S16 of the register 101 is channelled to the remaining seven multiplexer outputs. As an alternative to the dyed phase change cell described above, the panel may instead be adapted as a crystal nematic device.However, care must, in this case, be taken to minimise electrode resistivity to avoid a substantial drop in signal voltage along each electrode, a possible cause of failure.As an alternative to the use of a card reflector, the back plate electrodes may be arranged to function also as a reflector. In this case they may be made of thick roughened conducting material eg silver in which case a yellow dye may be dissolved in the D82 E61 liquid crystal material to give a neutral grey coloured background.
